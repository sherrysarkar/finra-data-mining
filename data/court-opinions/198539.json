A federal grand jury indicted a\r\ncoterie of defendants, including the six appellants (Giovanni \"King\r\nG\" Lara, George \"King Paradise\" Sepulveda, Terrence \"King Bullet\"\r\nBoyd, Shariff \"King Biz\" Roman, George \"King Animal\" Perry, and\r\nEryn \"King Guy\" Vasquez) for a multiplicity of crimes arising out\r\nof their involvement in the Providence chapter of the Almighty\r\nLatin King Nation.  Following a 44-day trial, each appellant was\r\nconvicted on one or more of the following charges:  racketeering,\r\n18 U.S.C.  1962(c); conspiracy to commit racketeering, id. \r\n1962(d); violent crime in aid of racketeering (including two\r\nmurders and two attempted murders), id.  1959(a)(1) &amp; (5);\r\ncarjacking, id.  2119(3); witness intimidation, id.  1512(b); use\r\nor carriage of a firearm during a crime of violence, id.  924(c);\r\nand being a felon in possession of a firearm, id.  922(g).  The\r\ndistrict court sentenced five of the appellants to life\r\nimprisonment and the sixth, Vasquez, to 100 months in prison. \r\nThese appeals followed.  We affirm.\r\nI.  BACKGROUND\r\nWe offer a thumbnail sketch of the interrelationship\r\nbetween the appellants and the Latin Kings, taking the information\r\ncontained in the record in the light most congenial to the jury's\r\nverdict.  See United States v. Houlihan, 92 F.3d 1271, 1277 (1st\r\nCir. 1996).  We eschew an exposition of the other evidence,\r\npreferring to discuss that evidence in the body of the opinion as\r\nit pertains to our consideration of particular points raised by the\r\nappellants.\r\nThe Latin Kings originated in Chicago in the 1940s.  Over\r\ntime, the street gang's influence spread to other venues.  The\r\nmovement  migrated east to Providence in the early 1990s.  Though\r\nsome chapters  of the Latin Kings, called Charter Nations, require\r\nHispanic descent as a condition of membership, others (like the\r\nProvidence chapter) allow persons of all races and ethnicities to\r\njoin.\r\nMembers of the Latin Kings signal their affiliation by\r\nsporting beads and other accouterments (including tattoos) in the\r\ngang's colors   black and gold.  They pay dues, attend weekly\r\nmeetings, and undertake \"missions\" (a euphemism that covers an\r\narray of activities ranging from running errands to committing\r\nviolent crimes) when directed by gang leaders.  Respect and\r\nsecurity rank among the gang's paramount concerns:  the Latin Kings\r\nroutinely discipline members for disrespectful behavior or for\r\ndiscussing Latin King business with outsiders.  Discipline runs a\r\nlengthy gamut from the \"silent treatment\" (suspension of all\r\ncommunications with other gang members), to revocation of drug use\r\nprivileges, to a \"bounce\" (a time-controlled beating limited to\r\ncertain areas of the body), to death.\r\nThe Almighty Latin King Nation is a hierarchical\r\norganization, and each of the appellants held one or more\r\nleadership positions within the Providence chapter.  Sepulveda\r\nserved as the group's president (sometimes called \"Inca\").  Boyd\r\nserved as the vice-president (sometimes called \"Cacique\"), and\r\nlater succeeded Sepulveda as president.  Roman served as the chief\r\nenforcer (a position previously held by Lara and subsequently held\r\nby Perry), and replaced Boyd as vice-president.  Vasquez functioned\r\nas the group's philosopher and then graduated to the post of\r\ninvestigator.\r\nAgainst this backdrop, we proceed to survey the\r\nappellants' assignments of error.  We start with two issues\r\npertaining to jury selection and then treat three of the trial\r\ncourt's evidentiary rulings.  At that juncture, we address a series\r\nof Rule 29 claims.  Finally, we tackle a perceived problem with the\r\njury instructions.  To the extent that the appellants mount other\r\nclaims, we reject them out of hand, without elaboration.\r\nII.  JURY SELECTION ISSUES\r\nMost of the appellants join in two challenges related to\r\njury selection:  all save Perry argue that the jury pool was not\r\ncomposed of a fair cross-section of the community, and all\r\ncalumnize the prosecution's use of a peremptory challenge to strike\r\nan African-American prospective juror.  We find no merit in either\r\nof these assigned errors.\r\n              A.  The Fair Cross-Section Claim.\r\nThe Constitution affords a criminal defendant the right\r\nto a trial \"by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein\r\nthe crime shall have been committed.\"  U.S. Const. amend. VI.  This\r\nconstitutional command requires that juries be selected from a\r\nrepresentative cross-section of the community.  See Duren v.\r\nMissouri, 439 U.S. 357, 358-59, 363-64 (1979); Taylor v. Louisiana,\r\n419 U.S. 522, 528 (1975).  Congress codified that requirement in\r\nthe Jury Selection and Service Act, (JSSA), 28 U.S.C.  1861.  The\r\nappellants assert that the venires from which the district court\r\nselected both their grand and petit juries defied this imperative. \r\nWe do not agree.\r\nThe appellants base their assertion on Rhode Island's\r\nfailure to comply with the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA),\r\n42 U.S.C.  1973gg to 1973gg-10 (1994).  This statute, known\r\ncolloquially as the motor voter law, took effect in Rhode Island on\r\nJanuary 1, 1995.  It requires states to accept voter registration\r\napplications in tandem with applications for drivers' licences and\r\nother permits, and to establish procedures to facilitate that\r\nprocess.  See id.  1973gg-2(a), 5(a).  Rhode Island has conceded\r\nthat it did not fully comply with the NVRA.  See League of Women\r\nVoters v. Rhode Island Bd. of Elections, No. 96-442ML (D.R.I. Sept.\r\n12, 1996) (consent decree).  Because the District of Rhode Island\r\nderives its jury wheel from the state's voter registration lists,\r\nsee In re Amended Juror Selection Plan, Misc. No. 75-209 (D.R.I.\r\nOct. 6, 1993), the appellants claim that this noncompliance\r\nrendered the District's jury venires unrepresentative and\r\ntransgressed both the Sixth Amendment and the JSSA.\r\nThis claim is fully preserved with respect to the five\r\nappellants who proffer it here.  Although only Sepulveda and Boyd\r\nmoved to dismiss the indictment on this basis, the district court\r\npermitted Lara, Roman, and Vasquez to adopt Sepulveda's and Boyd's\r\nposition.\r\nThough preserved, the claim is unavailing.  In order to\r\nestablish a fair cross-section violation under either the Sixth\r\nAmendment or the JSSA, a criminal defendant must make a tripartite\r\nshowing comprising cognizability (i.e., that the group alleged to\r\nbe excluded is a distinctive group), underrepresentation (i.e.,\r\nthat the group is not fairly and reasonably represented in the\r\nvenires from which juries are selected), and systematic exclusion\r\n(i.e., that the discerned underrepresentation is due to the group's\r\nsystematic exclusion from the jury-selection process).  See Duren,\r\n439 U.S. at 364; United States v. Royal,     F.3d    ,     (1st\r\nCir. 1999) [1999 WL 179003, at *4].  Assuming, arguendo, that the\r\nappellants have made the first of these three showings, they\r\nplainly have failed to satisfy either the second or third part of\r\nthe test.  Because the Duren test is conjunctive   the proponent of\r\na fair cross-section claim must satisfy all three of its elements\r\neither of these failings suffices to defeat the instant claims.\r\nWe start with underrepresentation.  A showing of\r\nunderrepresentation must be predicated on more than mere guesswork. \r\nSuch a showing requires competent proof (usually statistical in\r\nnature).  See, e.g., Duren, 439 U.S. at 364-65; United States v.\r\nPion, 25 F.3d 18, 22-23 (1st Cir. 1994); see also United States v.\r\nHafen, 726 F.2d 21, 23-24 (1st Cir. 1984) (considering the\r\nstatistical methodologies that might be used to determine\r\nunderrepresentation and selecting the absolute disparity method). \r\nThe single supporting document filed in the district court in\r\nconnection with the appellants' motions to dismiss was an affidavit\r\nattesting to the legislative history and purposes of the NVRA, and\r\nthe genesis of the consent decree.  This affidavit does not supply\r\nany foundation for a finding that the representation of Hispanic\r\nvenirepersons in the District was unfair, unreasonable, or in any\r\nway disproportionate to their numbers in the community.\r\nA successful fair cross-section claim also requires\r\ncompetent proof of the systematic nature of the exclusionary\r\nmechanisms leading to the underrepresentation.  See Duren, 439 U.S.\r\nat 366-67; Royal,     F.3d at     [1999 WL 179003, at *4].  The\r\nsupporting affidavit in this case offers no reason to believe that\r\nany systematic exclusion of Hispanics occurred in the selection\r\nprocess, let alone that it caused any material underrepresentation. \r\nThe NVRA is addressed to heightening overall popular participation\r\nin federal elections, as well as to increasing voter registration\r\nby members of racial minorities.  See 42 U.S.C.  1973gg.  The\r\nnaked fact of Rhode Island's noncompliance with the statute\r\nprovides no insight into whether voter registration lists (and,\r\ntherefore, the jury wheel compiled from those lists) were skewed\r\nfor or against minorities if skewed at all.  Since the appellants'\r\nproffer does not identify any systemic shortcoming or operational\r\ndeficiency that would tend to lessen Hispanic representation in the\r\nmaster jury wheel disproportionately, it does not satisfy the third\r\npart of the Duren test.  See Pion, 25 F.3d at 22-23.\r\nIt follows inexorably from what we have said that the\r\ndistrict court did not err in rejecting the pretrial motions to\r\ndismiss the indictment for want of a fair cross-section.\r\n                  B.  The Batson Challenge.\r\nThe appellants unanimously claim that the prosecution\r\nimpermissibly used a peremptory challenge to banish a prospective\r\njuror, Bruce King, because of his race.  We rehearse the events\r\nthat undergird this complaint.\r\nRelatively late in the voir dire process, King, a black\r\nmale, was tentatively seated.  The district judge, the prosecutor,\r\nand several defense attorneys proceeded to question him. \r\nSepulveda's lawyer noted that the evidence would include allusions\r\nto racial epithets and mention of the fact that many Latin King\r\nchapters did not welcome African Americans.  He then asked whether\r\nsuch testimony might affect King's ability to decide the case. \r\nKing replied, \"I believe I can be a fair and impartial juror under\r\nany circumstance.\"  Upon hearing this declaration, Perry began to\r\napplaud.  The court silenced him and the voir dire continued.  When\r\nthe defense team had completed its interrogation of King, the\r\nprosecutor asked that Perry's effusion be placed on the record.  He\r\nthen queried King as to whether the applause made him\r\nuncomfortable.  King responded in the negative, explaining that he\r\ndid not know why Perry felt impelled to clap.\r\nBecause the prosecutor's questions suggested a concern\r\nover whether the incident would jeopardize King's ability to render\r\nan impartial verdict, Roman's counsel requested an opportunity to\r\ndiscuss the matter.  He debunked the notion that King had been\r\ncompromised and emphasized that King was one of very few potential\r\nblack jurors who might be eligible for service in the case   \r\nperhaps the only one.  Judge Lisi permitted King to leave for the\r\nday and reprimanded Perry, warning him that another outburst would\r\nresult in his removal from the courtroom.  The dialogue between the\r\ncourt and counsel then resumed.  The prosecutor summarized his\r\nposition and speculated that \"[i]f we can find other black jurors\r\nin the panel to sit,\" he might use a peremptory strike to eject\r\nKing from the jury.  The day's proceedings ended without resolving\r\nthe issue of King's continued service.\r\nThe next day, the prosecutor moved to excuse King for\r\ncause and the parties argued the point.  The district judge took\r\nthe matter under advisement overnight.  She ultimately denied the\r\nmotion, explaining:\r\n  On the record, that is, taking Mr. King's\r\nstatements at face value as I do, I do not\r\nbelieve that cause exists to remove him from\r\nthis panel.  . . .  [I]t appears from what I\r\nobserved here in the courtroom and what\r\noccurred on the record afterwards with the\r\ncolloquy between the Government and Mr. King,\r\nthat Mr. King was not affected by Mr. Perry's\r\naction.\r\n\nWhen the time arrived for the parties to exercise their\r\nperemptory strikes, the government challenged King.  The appellants\r\nbranded this strike race-based and violative of the Equal\r\nProtection Clause.  After hearing argument, the district court\r\noverruled their objections.  Because this decision resolves a mixed\r\nquestion of law and fact that is peculiarly fact-sensitive, we\r\nreview it for clear error.  See United States v. Bergodere, 40 F.3d\r\n512, 516 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\nIt is by now common ground that race is an\r\nunconstitutional proxy for juror competence and impartiality, and,\r\ntherefore, that criminal defendants have an equal protection right\r\nto jury selection procedures that are free from racial biases.  See\r\nPowers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 404 (1991); Batson v. Kentucky, 476\r\nU.S. 79, 89 (1986); Bergodere, 40 F.3d at 515.  We have directed\r\nthe use of a three-part framework to aid in assessing the validity\r\nof an allegation that the prosecution stooped to employ a race-\r\nbased peremptory strike.  See Bergodere, 40 F.3d at 515 (citing,\r\ninter alia, Batson, 476 U.S. at 96-98).  This framework envisions\r\nthat:\r\n  [T]he defendant must make a prima facie\r\nshowing of discrimination in the prosecutor's\r\nlaunching of the strike.  If the defendant\r\nfulfills this requirement by establishing,\r\nsay, a prima facie case of a racially driven\r\nimpetus, then the prosecutor must proffer a\r\nrace-neutral explanation for having challenged\r\nthe juror. . . .  If the prosecutor complies,\r\nthen, at the third and final stage, the\r\ndistrict court must decide whether the\r\ndefendant has carried the ultimate burden of\r\nproving that the strike constituted purposeful\r\ndiscrimination on the basis of race.\r\n\nId. (citations and footnote omitted).  In deploying this framework,\r\nthe prosecutor's second-step burden of proffering a race-neutral\r\nexplanation for the strike \"is merely a burden of production, not\r\na burden of persuasion,\" and the defendant retains the devoir of\r\npersuasion throughout the course of the inquiry.  Id.\r\nIn this case, we can truncate the usual inquiry.  In the\r\ndistrict court, as here, the government tacitly acknowledged that\r\nthe defendants had (or could have) offered a prima facie showing\r\nthat the strike appeared discriminatory.  Thus, the first step of\r\nthe pavane need not detain us.  See Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S.\r\n352, 359 (1991).\r\nAt the second step, the government must advance a race-\r\nneutral explanation for its peremptory challenge.  In an effort to\r\nmeet this requirement, the prosecutor pointed to Perry's applause,\r\ntheorizing that Perry might have been trying either to create an\r\naffinity with King or to intimidate him.  In either event, the\r\nprosecutor stated, he feared that King's impartiality would wane,\r\nparticularly after King learned of the atrocities that the\r\ngovernment ascribed to Perry and his confederates.  Although the\r\nappellants contended that this explanation was bogus, the district\r\njudge accepted it.  King was excused, and the empanelment\r\ncontinued.  When sworn, the jury included one juror who described\r\nhimself as Mexican and one who appeared non-Caucasian (but from\r\nwhom no racial information was elicited).\r\nWe discern no clear error in Judge Lisi's ruling.  In\r\norder to meet the second-step requirement, a prosecutor's\r\nexplanation need only be unrelated to race on its face.  At this\r\npoint, neither the persuasiveness of the explanation nor the\r\ncredibility of the prosecutor is at issue.  See Purkett v. Elem,\r\n514 U.S. 765, 768-69 (1995) (per curiam); Hernandez, 500 U.S. at\r\n360.  Perry's clearly inappropriate courtroom behavior and its\r\npotential effect on King's ability to serve as a juror are in no\r\nway related to race, and, thus, the proffered reason crosses this\r\nmodest threshold.  See, e.g., Purkett, 514 U.S. at 769 (finding\r\nprosecutor's explanation that strikes of black jurors were based on\r\nbeards and long, unkempt hair to be race-neutral for purposes of\r\nthe second Batson way station).\r\nThis leaves the third, and final, determination:  whether\r\nthe appellants have proven that the strike constituted racial\r\ndiscrimination.  This decision boils down to whether the appellants\r\nhave convinced the district court that the race-neutral explanation\r\nfurnished by the government rings hollow.  Because the question is\r\nintensely fact-driven and the answer often pivots on credibility,\r\nappellate tribunals must scrutinize the trial court's response\r\nunder a highly deferential glass.  See Hernandez, 500 U.S. at 364-\r\n65; Batson, 476 U.S. at 98 n.21.\r\nIn this case, the trier credited the government's\r\nexplanation:\r\n  I have heard the explanation of the Government\r\nand I have observed [the prosecutor's]\r\nreaction to Mr. Perry's applause.  And I\r\ncannot say that [the prosecutor's] challenge\r\nhere is based on race.  [His] challenge is\r\nbased, as he says, on conduct and on the\r\nconcern that he has   and quite frankly, that\r\nthe Court has   as to what effect Mr. Perry's\r\nmisbehavior would have on Juror King . . . .\r\n\nThe judge also noted that she had observed no pattern of\r\ndiscrimination in the government's use of its peremptory challenges\r\na fact that may be entitled to special weight in determining\r\nwhether a prosecutor's race-neutral explanation for a peremptory\r\nchallenge is pretextual.  See Hernandez, 500 U.S. at 363.\r\nThe appellants urge us to hold that Judge Lisi committed\r\nclear error in upholding the prosecutor's strike.  They assert that\r\nshe misunderstood the applicable legal standard, but the record\r\nbelies this ipse dixit.  They also harp on the prosecutor's earlier\r\nstatement that he might consider exercising a peremptory challenge\r\nagainst King if other black jurors were empaneled.  This statement,\r\nthe appellants say, suggests that the government in certain\r\ncircumstances would have left King on the jury solely because he\r\nwas black, thus proving that the prosecutor had race in mind and\r\ndeliberately injected it into the jury-selection calculus.  While\r\nwe do not defend the prosecutor's comment (which was both\r\ninsensitive and unfortunate), we find no clear error in the\r\ndistrict court's conclusion that the prosecutor's remark did not\r\ndiscredit his race-neutral explanation.  See Cumpiano v. Banco\r\nSantander P.R., 902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir. 1990) (explaining that\r\nno clear error exists unless review \"on the whole of the record\"\r\ngenerates \"a strong, unyielding belief that a mistake has been\r\nmade\").\r\nThe governing principle, of course, is that a person's\r\nrace must be regarded as \"unrelated to his fitness as a juror.\" \r\nBatson, 476 U.S. at 87.  Here, the record makes manifest that Judge\r\nLisi took this principle fully into account, and her resolution of\r\nthe issue of pretext based on her assessment of the prosecutor's\r\ndemeanor and credibility cannot be disturbed.  Perry's paroxysm\r\ninjected an imponderable into the equation.  Trial lawyers\r\nunderstandably fear the unknown, and that fear, in itself, is not\r\nindicative of a race-based viewpoint.  When the prosecutor voiced\r\nthis sort of concern, the district judge was well-situated to\r\nassess his candor.  The judge did so here   and we will not second-\r\nguess her assessment.  After all, when the evidence gives rise to\r\ncompeting interpretations, each plausible, the factfinder's choice\r\nbetween them cannot be clearly erroneous.  See Smith v. F.W. Morse\r\n&amp; Co., 76 F.3d 413, 423 (1st Cir. 1996); Johnson v. Watts Regulator\r\nCo., 63 F.3d 1129, 1138 (1st Cir. 1995).\r\nIII.  EVIDENTIARY ISSUES\r\nThe appellants level a number of criticisms relating to\r\nthe admission of evidence.  Only three of these criticisms warrant\r\ndiscussion.\r\n                 A.  Coconspirator Testimony.\r\nBoyd disputes the district court's admission of certain\r\nvideotaped statements under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E).  We sketch\r\nthe circumstances.\r\nThe government played videotapes for the jury during the\r\ntrial.  These videotapes had been secured with the cooperation of\r\na confidential informant, Jose Ortiz, at whose home Latin King\r\nmeetings sometimes were held.  The videotape about which Boyd\r\ncomplains includes a solitary mention of him by Roman while\r\ndiscussing how Mendez's murder came about.  Boyd contemporaneously\r\nobjected to the admission of this evidence against him on the\r\nground that it fell outside the scope of Rule 801(d)(2)(E).  He\r\nalso seasonably requested an instruction limiting the jury's\r\nconsideration of the evidence to other defendants.  The trial judge\r\noverruled the objection, admitted the evidence unconditionally, and\r\ndeclined to give the requested limiting instruction.\r\nWe review challenges to the admission of evidence for\r\nabuse of discretion.  See Williams v. Drake, 146 F.3d 44, 47 (1st\r\nCir. 1998).  On this basis, Boyd's challenge stumbles at the\r\nstarting gate.  His argument addresses the admissibility of the\r\nevidence solely in respect to the only charge on which the jury\r\nfound him guilty   the murder-in-aid-of-racketeering charge.  But\r\nBoyd was also tried on (albeit not found guilty of) racketeering\r\nand racketeering conspiracy charges under the Racketeer Influenced\r\nand Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C.  1962, and he\r\nconcedes that the tape was admissible against him vis--vis those\r\ncharges.\r\nThis concession is dispositive, for the designation of a\r\ndeclaration as non-hearsay under Rule 801(d)(2)(E) is neither\r\ncount-specific nor conspiracy-specific.  See United States v.\r\nInnamorati, 996 F.2d 456, 486 (1st Cir. 1993).  Subject to\r\nrelevancy and similar considerations, out-of-court statements of a\r\ndeclarant coconspirator, if made during and in furtherance of a\r\nconspiracy, are admissible for the truth of the matter asserted,\r\nregardless of whether the conspiracy furthered is charged or\r\nuncharged, see United States v. Candelaria-Silva, 162 F.3d 698, 706\r\n(1st Cir. 1998); United States v. Rivera, 68 F.3d 5, 7 (1st Cir.\r\n1995), and regardless of whether it is identical to or different\r\nfrom the crime that the statements are offered to prove, see\r\nInnamorati, 996 F.2d at 486.  Hence, the trial court did not abuse\r\nits discretion in overruling Boyd's objection.\r\nWe think that the court also appropriately refused Boyd's\r\nrequest for a limiting instruction.  When the government proffered\r\nthe videotape, Boyd requested an instruction that \"the jury c[ould]\r\nnot consider the statements of Shariff Roman as substantive\r\nevidence or proof that Boyd participated in the murder of Mendez.\" \r\nBut the Mendez murder was not charged against Boyd merely as a\r\nviolent crime in aid of racketeering, 18 U.S.C.  1959(a)(1), but\r\nalso was charged as one of the predicate acts in the RICO count,\r\nid.  1962(c).  As Boyd concedes, the challenged statements were\r\nadmissible non-hearsay evidence as to the latter count.  Thus, the\r\njury was entitled to consider the relevant portions of Roman's\r\nstatements on that count as to all the defendants (Boyd included). \r\nOn this basis, the proposed instruction   which swept broadly\r\nrather than asking narrowly that the jury disregard the statements\r\nin respect to the separate charge that the murder was a violent\r\ncrime in aid of racketeering   would at best have been confusing,\r\nand at worst, legally erroneous.  It is, of course, hornbook law\r\nthat a party cannot rewardingly assign error to a trial court's\r\nrefusal to give a confusing, misleading, or legally incorrect\r\ninstruction.  See United States v. DeStefano, 59 F.3d 1, 4 (1st\r\nCir. 1995); United States v. David, 940 F.2d 722, 738 (1st Cir.\r\n1991).\r\nIn all events, we need not linger over this point,\r\ninasmuch as the videotape is not significantly inculpatory as to\r\nBoyd's involvement in the commission of the Mendez murder.  The\r\nonly statement on the tape that relates to Boyd at all occurs when\r\nRoman says that, at the time of the murder, \"Bullet was, um, in\r\nTraining School still, you know what I mean?\"  This statement, on\r\nits face, is benign (perhaps exculpatory).  Still, in a feat of\r\nlinguistic legerdemain, the government construed this statement at\r\ntrial to mean that Boyd had escaped from the Training School, and\r\nthus was available when the Latin Kings contrived the murder plot. \r\nEven if this odd interpretation is accepted, however, the statement\r\nonly showed that Boyd was available at the time of the Mendez\r\nmurder.  Since several percipient witnesses testified not only to\r\nhis availability, but also to his actual presence at the meetings\r\nin which the Latin Kings planned Mendez's murder, any error in\r\nrefusing to give the requested instruction was harmless because\r\nthere was no \"realistic possibility that admission of the evidence\r\ninfluenced the outcome of the trial\" as to Boyd's guilt on the\r\nsingle count of conviction (commission of a violent crime in aid of\r\nracketeering).  United States v. Polito, 856 F.2d 414, 420 (1st\r\nCir. 1988); cf. United States v. Ladd, 885 F.2d 954, 957-58 (1st\r\nCir. 1989) (finding erroneous admission of evidence harmless when\r\nthe evidence served only to prove a point well documented by other\r\nevidence).\r\n           B.  Testimony of Cooperating Witnesses.\r\nDuring the trial, the government offered the testimony of\r\nseveral cooperating witnesses, who testified in return for promises\r\nthat they would not be charged federally for certain crimes and/or\r\nfor recommendations of lenient sentencing in respect to crimes for\r\nwhich they had been or would be charged.  Five of the appellants\r\n(Boyd excluded) insist that the lower court should have barred\r\nthese witnesses from testifying, and that its failure to do so\r\nnecessitates a new trial.\r\nThe appellants pin their hopes on a witness-bribery\r\nstatute which provides in relevant part:\r\n  Whoever . . . directly or indirectly, gives,\r\noffers or promises anything of value to any\r\nperson, for or because of the testimony under\r\noath or affirmation given or to be given by\r\nsuch person as a witness upon a trial,\r\nhearing, or other proceeding, before any court\r\n. . . authorized by the laws of the United\r\nStates to hear evidence or take testimony . .\r\n. shall be fined under this title or\r\nimprisoned for not more than two years, or\r\nboth.\r\n\n18 U.S.C.  201(c)(2).  In mid-1998, a panel of the Tenth Circuit\r\ninterpreted this statute to forbid testimony given in exchange for\r\npromised leniency, and applied an exclusionary rule to such\r\ntestimony.  See United States v. Singleton, 144 F.3d 1343 (10th\r\nCir. 1998) (Singleton I).  Since then, the federal courts have been\r\ninundated with a flood of what have come to be called \"Singleton\r\narguments,\" and we take the opportunity to dam this misguided\r\nstream.\r\nSingleton I appears to us to be nothing more than an\r\naberration, and we reject its reasoning and result.  We use the\r\nterm \"aberration\" advisedly, because the opinion has been overruled\r\nin the circuit of its birth, see United States v. Singleton, 165\r\nF.3d 1297, 1298 (10th Cir. 1999) (en banc) (Singleton II), cert.\r\ndenied,     S. Ct.     [1999 WL 185874], and several other courts\r\nof appeals have disavowed its anfractuous reading of section\r\n201(c)(2), see, e.g., United States v. Lowery, 166 F.3d 1119, 1122-\r\n24 (11th Cir. 1999); United States v. Ramsey, 165 F.3d 980, 987\r\n(D.C. Cir. 1999); United States v. Ware, 161 F.3d 414, 418 (6th\r\nCir. 1998), cert. denied, 119 S. Ct. 1348 (1999); United States v.\r\nHaese, 162 F.3d 359, 366-68 (5th Cir. 1998), cert. denied,     S.\r\nCt.     (1999) [1999 WL 241837].  We, too, have intimated as much. \r\nSee United States v. Hernandez-Albino,     F.3d    ,     (1st Cir.\r\n1999) [No. 98-1643, slip op. at 16] (holding that refusal to follow\r\nSingleton I does not constitute plain error).  Today, we make our\r\nposition explicit and unqualified.\r\nThere are several reasons why section 201(c)(2) cannot be\r\ninvoked as a bright-line barrier to the government's use of\r\nwitnesses whose cooperation has been secured by agreements not to\r\nprosecute or by promises of recommended leniency.  The most basic\r\nreason is that section 201(c)(2) does not apply at all to the\r\nfederal sovereign qua prosecutor.  Accord Ramsey, 165 F.3d at 987-\r\n90; Haese, 162 F.3d at 366-67; Ware, 161 F.3d at 418-21.  After\r\nall, \"[s]tatutes of general purport do not apply to the United\r\nStates unless Congress makes the application clear and\r\nindisputable,\" Singleton II, 165 F.3d at 1300, and Congress has\r\ntaken no such steps in respect to this statute.  Reliance on this\r\ntenet is particularly apt where, as here, the failure to honor it\r\nwould divest the government of a long-established prerogative and,\r\nin the bargain, lead to an eccentric result.  See Nardone v. United\r\nStates, 302 U.S. 379, 383 (1937).\r\nWe add, moreover, that the Singleton I panel's reading of\r\nsection 201(c)(2) cannot be correct because such a reading would\r\npreclude enforcement or limit the efficacy of the terms of several\r\nmore recent   and more specific   statutes, all of which presuppose\r\nthe potential use of testimony in exchange for non-prosecution\r\nagreements, leniency recommendations, and/or other valuable\r\npromises.  See, e.g., 28 U.S.C.  994(n) (authorizing the\r\nSentencing Commission to include in the sentencing guidelines a\r\nmechanism by which courts may reduce sentences to account for\r\nconvicted defendants' substantial assistance); 18 U.S.C.  3521\r\n(providing for government-subsidized relocation and protection of\r\nwitnesses in return for their testimony); 18 U.S.C.  6002, 6003\r\n(allowing prosecutors to obtain orders compelling witnesses to\r\ntestify despite potential self-incrimination, in return for\r\nimmunity from prosecution based on that testimony).  These\r\nenactments would be crippled, if not rendered utterly meaningless,\r\nwere we to follow the siren's call of Singleton I.  Courts\r\ngenerally adhere to the principle that statutes relating to the\r\nsame subject matter should be construed harmoniously if possible,\r\nand if not, that more recent or specific statutes should prevail\r\nover older or more general ones.  See HCSC-Laundry v. United\r\nStates, 450 U.S. 1, 6 (1981); Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535, 550-\r\n51 (1974); see also 2B Norman J. Singer, Statutes and Statutory\r\nConstruction  51.02-03 (1992).  There is no basis for eschewing\r\nthat time-tested principle in this instance.\r\nAt the risk of carting coal to Newcastle, we briefly note\r\ntwo other bases for disavowing Singleton I.  First, it is at least\r\narguable that section 201(c)(2) should not apply to the government\r\nbecause the Dictionary Act, 1 U.S.C.  1, which creates a frame of\r\nreference for parsing statutes, defines the word \"whoever\" to\r\ninclude \"corporations, companies, associations, firms,\r\npartnerships, societies, and joint stock companies, as well as\r\nindividuals,\" but does not define the word to include the United\r\nStates.  Id.; see also Ramsey, 165 F.3d at 987.  Second, even if\r\nsection 201(c)(2) were applicable to the testimony of cooperating\r\nwitnesses, the appropriate penalty for the use at trial of\r\ntestimony obtained in derogation of the statute most likely would\r\nbe a fine or imprisonment (as prescribed by the statute itself),\r\nnot resort to a judicially-crafted exclusionary rule.  See United\r\nStates v. Condon, 170 F.3d  687, 689 (7th Cir. 1999); Ramsey, 165\r\nF.3d at 991.\r\nWe have said enough on this score.  We hold, without\r\nserious question, that 18 U.S.C.  201(c)(2) does not bar the\r\ngovernment from promising leniency or the like to cooperating\r\nwitnesses.  Accordingly, the district court did not err in\r\nadmitting the contested testimony.\r\n               C.  Scope of Cross-Examination.\r\nPerry, who testified at trial in his own defense, strives\r\nto persuade us that the district court gave the government too free\r\nrein in cross-examination.  We are unconvinced.\r\nPerry's thesis is that the challenged cross-examination\r\nexceeded the scope of direct examination and, therefore, should\r\nhave been foreclosed.  This thesis rests primarily on the first\r\nsentence of Fed. R. Evid. 611(b), which reads:  \"Cross-examination\r\nshould be limited to the subject matter of the direct examination\r\nand matters affecting the credibility of the witness.\"  Perry notes\r\nthat his direct examination consisted of only ten questions,\r\nrestricted to the Vandergroen carjacking and its sequelae.  See\r\ninfra Part IV(A)(2) (describing this carjacking).  Yet, the trial\r\ncourt allowed the prosecutor, over objection, to cross-question\r\nPerry not only about the carjacking, but also about other crimes of\r\nwhich he and his codefendants were accused (including the Mendez\r\nmurder and two attempted homicides charged as predicate acts in the\r\nRICO conspiracy count), and about a draft of a letter seized from\r\nhis jail cell in which he accused his former girlfriend of\r\n\"snitching\" and requested that she be silenced.\r\nWe review district court rulings anent the scope of\r\ncross-examination solely for abuse of discretion.  See United\r\nStates v. Smith, 145 F.3d 458, 462 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 119 S.\r\nCt. 383 (1998); United States v. Morla-Trinidad, 100 F.3d 1, 4 (1st\r\nCir. 1996).  We find none here.  It is standard fare for cross-\r\nexaminers to inquire into issues not mentioned on direct\r\nexamination, but related to and made relevant by that examination. \r\nSee McGautha v. California, 402 U.S. 183, 215 (1971).  It is\r\nequally standard   and equally proper   for a cross-examiner to\r\ndelve into matters which, although not mentioned on direct\r\nexamination, bear on the witness's credibility.  See id. \r\nCollectively, these two categories envelop the questions that Perry\r\nchallenges.  We explain briefly.\r\nThe indictment charged the Vandergroen carjacking as a\r\npredicate act within the RICO conspiracy and as a violent crime in\r\naid of racketeering.  At trial, the government asserted that\r\nVandergroen's disrespect of Perry offended the Latin King code and\r\nled Perry to target him.  During the government's case in chief, at\r\nleast two witnesses testified in support of this theory.  Because\r\nPerry's direct examination included a denial that the Vandergroen\r\nincident had anything to do with the Latin Kings, the government\r\nwas entitled to test the veracity of this denial.  One way of doing\r\nso was to interrogate Perry about other crimes that he had\r\ncommitted under the organization's auspices.\r\nIn his direct testimony, Perry also endeavored to\r\nexonerate Lara, portraying him on direct examination as unaware  \r\nuntil it was too late   that either the carjacking or the killing\r\nwould transpire.  On cross-examination, the government sought to\r\nshow that this version of events conflicted with Perry's earlier\r\nstatement to the police and to suggest that he was covering for\r\nLara as part of his perceived duty as a Latin King not to \"rat\" on\r\nfellow gang members.  It was in this context that the prosecutor\r\nasked about the correspondence in which Perry solicited punishment\r\nfor his loose-lipped girlfriend.  Thus, we detect no abuse of\r\ndiscretion in Judge Lisi's determination that these lines of cross-\r\nquestioning were not beyond the scope of Perry's direct\r\nexamination.\r\nWe hasten to add that, even were we to conclude that the\r\nchallenged questions exceeded the scope of direct examination, we\r\nnonetheless would uphold the judge's rulings.  Perry's\r\nanimadversions largely overlook the second sentence of Rule 611(b),\r\nwhich empowers trial courts, \"in the exercise of discretion, [to]\r\npermit inquiry into additional matters as if on direct\r\nexamination.\"  Fed. R. Evid. 611(b).   This authorization confers\r\ndiscretion on trial judges to disregard the first sentence of Rule\r\n611(b) and allow cross-examination to extend into areas not\r\nexplored on direct.  See Losacco v. F.D. Rich Constr. Co., 992 F.2d\r\n382, 385 (1st Cir. 1993); United States v. Arnott, 704 F.2d 322,\r\n324 (6th Cir. 1983); United States v. Raper, 676 F.2d 841, 846-47\r\n(D.C. Cir. 1982).  But cf. Lis v. Robert Packer Hosp., 579 F.2d\r\n819, 823 (3d Cir. 1978) (confining the exercise of a district\r\ncourt's discretion under the second sentence of Rule 611(b)  to\r\n\"special circumstances\").  In this instance, the challenged\r\nquestions occupied only a fraction of the cross-examination and\r\nbore a close relationship to major trial issues.  Thus, whether or\r\nnot the questions fell within the scope of the direct examination,\r\nwe could not say that the trial judge's overruling of Perry's\r\nobjections constituted an abuse of discretion.\r\nIV.  SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\r\nWe next address the denial of Lara's, Boyd's, and Roman's\r\nmotions for judgment of acquittal under Fed. R. Crim. P. 29.  In\r\nreviewing such denials, the court of appeals affords plenary review\r\nand applies precisely the same regimen that obtains in the trial\r\ncourt.  This regimen entails considering the evidence in the light\r\nmost favorable to the prosecution and determining whether this body\r\nof proof, as a whole, has sufficient bite to ground a reasoned\r\nconclusion that the government proved each of the elements of the\r\ncharged crime beyond a reasonable doubt.  See United States v.\r\nValle, 72 F.3d 210, 216-17 (1st Cir. 1995); United States v.\r\nOlbres, 61 F.3d 967, 970 (1st Cir. 1995).  This prosecution-\r\nfriendly standard requires the resolution of all evidentiary\r\ndisputes and credibility questions in favor of the government, and\r\nalso requires the acceptance of those reasonable inferences from\r\nthe evidence (whether or not inevitable) that support the\r\ngovernment's view of the case.  See United States v. Carroll, 105\r\nF.3d 740, 742 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1258 (1997).  The\r\njury's verdict must stand unless the record, viewed from this coign\r\nof vantage, would not allow a rational jury to find the defendant\r\nguilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  See id.; see also Olbres, 61\r\nF.3d at 970.  With these criteria in mind, we turn to the specifics\r\nof the appellants' claims.\r\n                    A.  Lara's Challenges.\r\nLara contests the sufficiency of the evidence in regard\r\nto two separate convictions.  We discuss these initiatives\r\nsequentially.\r\n1.  Witness Intimidation.  Initially, Lara attacks his\r\nconviction for intimidating a government witness, Manuel Pacheco\r\n(variously referred to as \"Manny\" or \"Joey\").  As it applies in\r\nthis case, the statute of conviction requires the government to\r\nprove two elements:  (i) that the defendant knowingly used\r\nintimidation, physical force, or threats against another, and (ii)\r\nthat this conduct was intended to \"influence, delay, or prevent the\r\ntestimony of any person in an official proceeding.\"  18 U.S.C. \r\n1512(b)(1).  The term \"official proceeding\" encompasses both\r\nfederal criminal trials and grand jury sessions.  See id. \r\n1515(a)(1)(A); see also United States v. Victor, 973 F.2d 975, 978\r\n(1st Cir. 1992).\r\nThe facts, marshaled in the light most flattering to the\r\ngovernment, amply support the jury's verdict on this count.  The\r\njury reasonably could have found that Pacheco aided the authorities\r\nin their investigation of the Latin Kings, that the organization's\r\ntop brass suspected as much, and that they feared that Pacheco had\r\nappeared (or would soon do so) as a witness before the grand jury\r\nand/or at an ensuing trial.  In November 1994, Sepulveda (then the\r\npresident of the Providence chapter) ordered Pacheco's\r\n\"termination\" (a disposition which, in Latin King parlance, might\r\nmean anything from a beating to a slaying).\r\nAt the time, Pacheco was housed in the Rhode Island state\r\npenitentiary (as was Lara).  Vasquez and two fellow Latin Kings\r\n(Alex Mesa and Rodney Santi) were dispatched to explain the\r\nsituation and communicate the order to a pickup team of\r\nincarcerated Latin Kings.  At the penitentiary, the three\r\nmessengers visited one on one with a trio of Latin King inmates\r\n(Lara, Kareem Abdulla, and Edson Toro) and carried out their\r\nassignment.  To be specific, Vasquez met with Lara, Mesa with\r\nAbdulla, and Santi with Toro.  The following evening, Lara,\r\nAbdulla, Toro, and a fourth incarcerated Latin King, Richard\r\nRodriguez, approached Pacheco in a dark corner of the prison yard. \r\nThe group surrounded Pacheco and taunted him about being a \"rat.\" \r\nHe was then struck from behind and savagely beaten.\r\nLara declares that this evidence is inadequate because no\r\ndirect testimony showed that he received the termination order\r\n(indeed, Vasquez testified to the contrary) or participated in\r\nadministering the beating.  These declarations comprise more cry\r\nthan wool.  Mesa and Santi testified that they rode to the prison\r\nwith Vasquez, that the three of them discussed the termination\r\norder en route, and that they each relayed the message to the\r\ninmate with whom they spoke.  Vasquez signed the prison's visitor\r\nlog.  He admitted visiting with Lara.  Pacheco testified that Lara\r\nhad been in the group that surrounded him and had been behind him\r\nwhen he was struck from the rear.\r\nAlthough this evidence is largely circumstantial, the\r\njury reasonably could have disbelieved Vasquez's self-serving\r\ndenial and inferred that he followed orders (as his fellow\r\nmessengers had) and communicated the directive to Lara.  By like\r\ntoken, the jury reasonably could have credited Pacheco's account\r\nand thus inferred that Lara participated in the beating.  Any\r\ndivergent view of the evidence would elevate coincidence to an art\r\nform.  The proof, therefore, was sufficient to convict on the\r\nwitness intimidation count.  See United States v. Castro-Lara, 970\r\nF.2d 976, 981 (1st Cir. 1992) (explaining that \"circumstantial\r\nevidence, in and of itself, is often enough to ground a\r\nconviction\"); see also Carroll, 105 F.3d at 743 (noting, in the\r\ncontext of rejecting an insufficiency challenge, the reticence of\r\nappellate courts to \"second-guess\" a jury's credibility judgments).\r\n2.  Carjacking.  Lara and Perry were convicted of a\r\ncarjacking on September 6, 1994.  This scenario involved Temujin\r\nVandergroen, who apparently precipitated the incident by playing\r\nwith a knife in front of Perry's children.  Perry interpreted this\r\nas a sign of disrespect, intolerable to a Latin King, and asked\r\nLara to accompany him while he relieved Vandergroen of his Ford\r\nEscort (which was adorned with tire rims that Perry fancied).\r\nThe two men asked Vandergroen to take a ride with them. \r\nWhen he agreed, Perry (who had brought along a sawed-off shotgun)\r\nsat behind Vandergroen in the car, while Lara sat in the front\r\npassenger seat.  At Perry's request, Vandergroen drove to a\r\ndeserted neighborhood.  Perry then told Vandergroen to slow or stop\r\nthe vehicle, and, when Vandergroen complied, Perry shot him.  Perry\r\nand Lara shoved Vandergroen's body into the street and returned to\r\na Latin King hangout, where they were seen with blood and brain\r\nmatter on their clothing.  The two later burned and abandoned the\r\ncar.\r\nOn these facts, the jury convicted Lara of carjacking in\r\nviolation of 18 U.S.C.  2119(3).  Lara attacks the sufficiency of\r\nthe evidence from an odd angle.  He does not allege that the\r\ngovernment failed to prove that he committed specific elements of\r\nthe offense, but, rather, claims that the only witness whose\r\ntestimony implicated him in the carjacking (Pacheco) was\r\nunreliable.  This attack is impuissant.  In the usual case, the\r\ncredibility of witnesses is for the jury, see Carroll, 105 F.3d at\r\n743; United States v. Laboy-Delgado, 84 F.3d 22, 27 (1st Cir.\r\n1996), and there is nothing here that mitigates against the\r\nconventional application of this rule.  There were conflicting\r\naccounts of Lara's participation in the carjacking, and the jury\r\nwas free to decide which, if any, to believe.\r\nLara has a fallback position.  Perry had given testimony\r\nexculpating Lara from complicity in the Vandergroen carjacking. \r\nSee supra Part III(C).  Lara hypothesizes that Perry's disgusting\r\ncourtroom conduct, see United States v. Perry, 116 F.3d 952, 954\r\n(1st Cir. 1997), unfairly undercut this exculpatory testimony. \r\nBut there is simply no evidence that Perry's conduct prejudiced the\r\njury against Lara.  When a defendant presses a plausible claim of\r\nspillover effect, differentiated verdicts often constitute tangible\r\nevidence of the jury's enduring ability to distinguish between the\r\nculpability of codefendants.  See, e.g., United States v. Flores-\r\nRivera, 56 F.3d 319, 326 n.2 (1st Cir. 1995).  This case is of that\r\nstripe:   even after Perry's dramatic display, the jury acquitted\r\nLara, but convicted Perry, on several counts, including the charge\r\nof using or carrying a firearm during the Vandergroen carjacking. \r\nThen, too, the trial judge instructed the jurors soon after Perry's\r\ngaffe that they should draw no adverse inference therefrom against\r\nany defendant (Perry included).  See Perry, 116 F.3d at 954.  This\r\ntimely instruction further supports the conclusion that Lara was\r\nnot prejudiced by Perry's actions.  See Richardson v. Marsh, 481\r\nU.S. 200, 206 (1987) (remarking \"the almost invariable assumption\r\nof the law that jurors follow their instructions\"); United States\r\nv. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1185 (1st Cir. 1993) (similar).\r\nTo sum up, because the evidence allowed a rational jury\r\nto find Lara guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of both witness\r\nintimidation and carjacking, the district court did not err in\r\nrefusing to grant an instructed verdict of acquittal on either or\r\nboth of these counts.\r\n              B.  Boyd's and Roman's Challenge.\r\nBoyd and Roman challenge the sufficiency of the evidence\r\nto support their convictions for committing a violent crime (the\r\nmurder of Jose Mendez) in aid of racketeering.  The relevant facts,\r\nstated from the perspective most conducive to the verdict, are as\r\nfollows.\r\nOn Saturday, November 5, 1994, several members of the\r\nProvidence Latin Kings attended a party in Connecticut.  On that\r\noccasion, they learned that their Connecticut counterparts were at\r\nwar with a rival gang, the Netas.  Two Connecticut Latin Kings\r\nreturned to Rhode Island with the Providence contingent.  One of\r\nthem, Peter Natal, later became a confidential informant.\r\nAt a meeting of the Providence chapter held on Monday,\r\nNovember 7, Sepulveda told his cohorts about the war in\r\nConnecticut.  Immediately after this announcement, the officers of\r\nthe Providence chapter (including, at least, Sepulveda, Boyd, and\r\nRoman) went into executive session and discussed a plan to kill the\r\nleader of the Netas in Providence.  This strategy was hatched on\r\nthe theory that, in Sepulveda's words, \"without the head, the body\r\nfalls.\"  The executive session ended on this note, the main meeting\r\nresumed, and Sepulveda asked the general membership to forget what\r\nhe had said about a war.\r\nNatal attended the executive session.  He testified that,\r\nduring this discussion, the Latin King hierarchs noted the near-\r\ndearth of local Netas; Providence was virgin territory and there\r\nwere only four full members of the Neta gang at that point.  Mesa\r\nconfirmed this assessment.  He testified that \"there was [sic] very\r\nfew Netas out here.  There's probably like four Netas.  Each one\r\nhad a position [i.e., held an office in the gang].\"  Initially,\r\nthere was confusion over whether Jose Mendez might be the president\r\nof the Providence Netas, but a consensus gradually developed in\r\nfavor of the view that Winston Navarette held that office.\r\nAfter the meeting adjourned, several participants\r\nrepaired to the dwelling that Roman shared with his then-paramour,\r\nTia Barboza.  A small group, including Boyd and Roman, met in Tia's\r\nbedroom and finalized the plan to kill the head of the Netas.  Four\r\nmembers were assigned responsibility for carrying out the\r\nassassination:  Perry, Santi, Hakim Davis, and Juan Garcia. \r\nWitnesses stated that Boyd and Roman each chose at least one member\r\nof the \"hit squad.\"  The next day, Roman distributed weapons from\r\nthe gang's cache to the appointees.\r\nIn retrospect, it appears that, at the crucial time, the\r\nProvidence Netas had four officers:  Winston Navarette (president),\r\nJose Mendez (vice-president), Edgar Pichardo (disciplinarian), and\r\nMaquiva Mendez (secretary).  The Netas lived together.  When the\r\nhit squad arrived at their abode, they asked for Navarette and were\r\ninformed that he was out of town.  The trial testimony was\r\nunequivocal that when the Neta president was away, the vice-\r\npresident assumed his responsibilities.  Thus, Jose Mendez,\r\nnominally the Neta vice-president, was the head of the Netas in\r\nNavarette's absence.\r\nUpon learning of Navarette's unavailability, the crew\r\ninvited Jose Mendez, who was wearing his Neta colors at the time,\r\nto smoke some marijuana.  The group, now five in number, walked to\r\na nearby field where Perry shot Mendez from behind, killing him. \r\nThe four Latin Kings fled.\r\nBoyd claims that this evidence failed to link him\r\nsufficiently to Mendez's murder.  He argues that even the most\r\ngenerous view of the evidence fails to support the jury's verdict\r\nbecause there was no evidence (1) that the plan was to kill\r\nwhomever was the Neta leader, (2) that the shooter was aware that\r\nhis target was the de facto leader, or (3) that the shooter knew\r\nMendez had become the de facto leader of the Netas in Navarette's\r\nabsence.\r\nBefore coming to grips with these arguments, we address\r\na procedural issue.  Roman did not raise the sufficiency question\r\nin his opening brief, but, after perusing Boyd's brief, sought\r\nleave from this court to adopt the argument.  By order entered\r\nFebruary 1, 1999, we granted this request provisionally, subject to\r\na final determination after the case was heard.\r\nThe standard for adoption of arguments by reference\r\ninvolves a determination of whether the arguments are \"readily\r\ntransferrable from the proponent's case to the adopter's case.\" \r\nDavid, 940 F.2d at 737.  We ordinarily look with disfavor upon\r\nattempts to adopt factbound arguments by reference.  See, e.g.,\r\nCastro-Lara, 970 F.2d at 982; David, 940 F.2d at 737.  Under the\r\npeculiar circumstances of this case, however, we allow the\r\nadoption.  Roman, like Boyd, moved for judgment of acquittal below,\r\nand relied on the same three grounds in support of his claim that\r\nthe evidence was insufficient to convict him of Mendez's murder. \r\nMore importantly, although the evidence as to each varies on the\r\nfirst two grounds, Boyd's arguments are generally relevant to\r\nRoman, who, like Boyd, was a part of the officers' meetings, but\r\nnot a member of the crew sent to carry out the execution.  Thus,\r\nthe David \"ready transferability\" standard is satisfied and we will\r\nentertain the insufficiency claims of both appellants.\r\nBoyd's and Roman's first two points are easily\r\ndispatched.  Davis, a first-hand participant, described the plan\r\nand the implementing order as being aimed at killing the head of\r\nthe Netas.  This order was given in the presence, and with the\r\nacquiescence, of Boyd and Roman.  It was designed as a preemptive\r\nstrike on the Neta leadership.\r\nAlthough some of the witnesses whose testimony the\r\ngovernment hawks had made prior inconsistent statements, the same\r\nis true for several witnesses whose testimony Boyd and Roman\r\nespouse.  The jurors were entitled to choose which witnesses to\r\ncredit, and, in the posture of a sufficiency-of-the-evidence\r\nchallenge, we must assume that they credited those witnesses whose\r\ntestimony lent support to the verdict.  See Carroll, 105 F.3d at\r\n742-43; Laboy-Delgado, 84 F.3d at 27-28.  At any rate, jurors are\r\nnot required to discard testimony that appears to contain internal\r\ninconsistencies, but may credit some parts of a witness's testimony\r\nand disregard other potentially contradictory portions.  See United\r\nStates v. O'Brien, 14 F.3d 703, 707 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\nThe third deficiency to which Boyd and Roman allude is\r\nmore nettlesome.  The government offered no direct evidence that\r\nthe shooter (Perry) knew of Jose Mendez's position as de facto\r\nleader of the Netas at the time of the murder.  Still, direct\r\nevidence is not essential to proof of criminality.  See id. at 706-\r\n07; Castro-Lara, 970 F.2d at 981; United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d\r\n707, 711 (1st Cir. 1992).  In this instance, the circumstantial\r\nevidence is telling:  the proof (particularly the testimony of\r\nNatal and Mesa) showed that at least some Latin Kings knew there\r\nwere only four full-fledged members of the Netas in Providence, and\r\nthat all of them were officers of the gang.  Mendez's name was\r\nbandied about at the executive session (which both Boyd and Roman\r\nattended) as the possible head of the Netas.  Although consensus\r\nlater formed around the idea that Navarette occupied the top rung\r\non the ladder, the discussion of Mendez's involvement strongly\r\nsuggests that the Latin King leadership was keenly aware that he\r\nheld a relatively high position in the Netas.\r\nWe have held before that evidence of events that occur\r\nsubsequent to the commission of a crime can shed light upon an\r\nactor's guilt vel non.  See, e.g., United States v. Sutton, 970\r\nF.2d 1001, 1007 (1st Cir. 1992); United States v. Mena, 933 F.2d\r\n19, 25 n.5 (1st Cir. 1991).  In this instance, evidence of the\r\nLatin King leaders' reaction to the murder bolsters the\r\ngovernment's case.  Davis recalled that Sepulveda, then the Latin\r\nKing president, responded to the report of Mendez's demise by\r\nremarking that the hit squad had done a good job.  Moreover, the\r\nLatin Kings did not mount a manhunt for Navarette after the Mendez\r\nmurder because, in Davis's words, their \"mission\" had been\r\ncompleted successfully.\r\nJurors are entitled to draw reasonable inferences from\r\nproven facts.  On this record, we think that two key inferences are\r\nsupportable.  First, the jury reasonably could have inferred that\r\nPerry was aware of Mendez's leadership role in the Netas.  Second,\r\nthe jury reasonably could have inferred that when the hit squad\r\nencountered Mendez, its members believed that he was likely the\r\nhighest available member of the Neta leadership and killed him for\r\nthat reason, in compliance with the order that had issued.  Boyd's\r\nand Roman's alternate hypothesis   that Navarette's absence foiled\r\nthe plot, and that Perry killed Mendez in order to satisfy his\r\nbloodlust   was not implausible, but the jury rejected it in favor\r\nof a finding that Perry pulled the trigger to effect the directive\r\nthat had been handed down by the Latin King hierarchs.  This choice\r\nfell well within the jury's proper purview.  See United States v.\r\nGifford, 17 F.3d 462, 467 (1st Cir. 1994) (noting that the evidence\r\n\"need not rule out other hypotheses more congenial to a finding of\r\ninnocence\" in order to defeat a Rule 29 motion).  Thus, we conclude\r\nthat the evidence suffices to sustain the disputed convictions. \r\nSee Bourjaily v. United States, 483 U.S. 171, 179-80 (1987)\r\n(explaining that \"individual pieces of evidence, insufficient in\r\nthemselves to prove a point, may in cumulation prove it\"); Stewart\r\nv. Coalter, 48 F.3d 610, 615-16 (1st Cir. 1995) (discussing\r\npermissible inferences in criminal cases).\r\nV.  JURY INSTRUCTIONS\r\nLara offers several complaints about the district court's\r\njury instructions on the carjacking count.  Only one of these\r\npoints deserves comment.\r\nTracking the applicable statute, 18 U.S.C.  2119(3) (see\r\nsupra note 5), the court instructed the jury that it must find four\r\nelements in order to convict:  (1) that the named defendants (Lara\r\nand Perry), by means of force or violence, (2) took from the person\r\nor presence of Vandergroen a motor vehicle (3) that previously had\r\nbeen transported, shipped, or received in interstate or foreign\r\ncommerce, and (4) that one or both of the named defendants\r\npossessed a firearm at the time.  Lara's most fervent challenge,\r\nproperly preserved, concerns the court's elaboration upon the\r\nfourth element.  The court stated:\r\n  [T]he government must prove that at least one\r\nof the two defendants was in possession of a\r\nfirearm.  A person has possession of something\r\nif the person knows of its presence and has\r\nphysical control of it, or has the power and\r\nintention to control it.  More than one person\r\ncan be in possession of something if each\r\nknows of its presence and has the power and\r\nintention to control it.\r\n\nLara condemns this instruction because it allowed the jury to\r\nconvict him although only Perry actually possessed a firearm.  And\r\nto illustrate the harmfulness of this error, Lara points out that\r\nthe jury acquitted him on a related charge of using or carrying a\r\nfirearm during a crime of violence, 18 U.S.C.  924(c).\r\nIn the face of properly preserved objections, we evaluate\r\nchallenged jury instructions under an abuse of discretion rubric,\r\nconsidering the charge as a whole.  See DeStefano, 59 F.3d at 2-3;\r\nUnited States v. Cintolo, 818 F.2d 980, 1003 (1st Cir. 1987).  So\r\nviewed, Judge Lisi's possession instruction passes muster.  The\r\nindictment charged Lara not only as a principal in the carjacking,\r\nbut also as an aider and abettor under 18 U.S.C.  2.  In her\r\ninstructions, Judge Lisi described the workings of the latter\r\nstatute in considerable detail, stating, inter alia, \"you may find\r\na defendant guilty of the offense charged if you find beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt that the government has proven that another person\r\nactually committed the offense with which the defendant is charged,\r\nand that the defendant aided, abetted, induced, or procured that\r\nperson to commit the offense.\"  She later described the carjacking\r\ncount as charging Perry and Lara with having violated both section\r\n2119(3) and section 2.  Thus, under the instructions, as long as\r\nthe jury found that either Perry or Lara intended to take\r\nVandergroen's vehicle by forcible or violent means and carried a\r\nfirearm to that end, the other defendant could be found guilty as\r\nan aider and abettor if he knew of the plan and intended to assist\r\nin its accomplishment.  This correctly reflects applicable law. \r\nSee United States v. Oliver, 60 F.3d 547, 551 (9th Cir. 1995),\r\nrev'd on other grounds sub nom. Jones v. United States, 119 S. Ct.\r\n1215 (1999); United States v. Harris, 25 F.3d 1275, 1278-79 (5th\r\nCir. 1994).\r\nThe jury's acquittal of Lara on the section 924(c) count\r\ndoes not discredit this conclusion.  For one thing, the\r\ninstructions on that count did not make provision for aider/abettor\r\nliability, and, therefore, the verdicts were not inconsistent.  For\r\nanother thing, the two statutes differ in a material respect. \r\nSection 2119(3) discusses \"possession\" of a firearm, while section\r\n924(c) discusses \"use and carr[iage].\"  Because the definitions of\r\n\"use\" and \"carry\" under section 924(c) denote more than mere\r\npossession, a jury reasonably can find, without any logical\r\ninconsistency, that a defendant who meets the requirements of the\r\npossession element under section 2119 does not meet the more\r\nrigorous requirements imposed by section 924(c).  See Muscarello\r\nv. United States, 118 S. Ct. 1911, 1914 (1998) (discussing\r\ncarriage); Bailey v. United States, 516 U.S. 137, 143 (1995)\r\n(discussing use).\r\nIf more were needed   and we do not think that it is   we\r\nnote that Lara's complaint, as framed, seems to arise more from the\r\nperceived mismatch between his acquittal under section 924(c) and\r\nhis conviction under section 2119(3) than from any actual flaw in\r\nJudge Lisi's charge to the jury.  Thus   although Lara disclaims\r\nsuch a theorem   we are left with the decided impression that a\r\nclaim of inconsistent verdicts lies at the heart of this assignment\r\nof error.  In recent times, we repeatedly have rejected such\r\nchallenges to criminal verdicts, see, e.g., United States v.\r\nCrochiere, 129 F.3d 233, 239 (1st Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 118 S.\r\nCt. 1364 (1998); United States v. Bucuvalas, 909 F.2d 593, 594 (1st\r\nCir. 1990), and nothing about this case differentiates it from the\r\nmine-run.\r\nVI.  CONCLUSION\r\nWe need go no further.  A painstaking review of this\r\namplitudinous record reveals that the appellants were convicted by\r\na properly constituted jury after a full and fair trial, free from\r\nreversible error, before a judge who exhibited extraordinary care\r\nand patience.  Their appeals are without basis in fact or in law.\r\n\nAffirmed.\n",

A federal grand jury indicted a\r\ncoterie of defendants, including the six appellants (Giovanni \"King\r\nG\" Lara, George \"King Paradise\" Sepulveda, Terrence \"King Bullet\"\r\nBoyd, Shariff \"King Biz\" Roman, George \"King Animal\" Perry, and\r\nEryn \"King Guy\" Vasquez) for a multiplicity of crimes arising out\r\nof their involvement in the Providence chapter of the Almighty\r\nLatin King Nation.  Following a 44-day trial, each appellant was\r\nconvicted on one or more of the following charges:  racketeering,\r\n18 U.S.C.  1962(c); conspiracy to commit racketeering, id. \r\n1962(d); violent crime in aid of racketeering (including two\r\nmurders and two attempted murders), id.  1959(a)(1) &amp; (5);\r\ncarjacking, id.  2119(3); witness intimidation, id.  1512(b); use\r\nor carriage of a firearm during a crime of violence, id.  924(c);\r\nand being a felon in possession of a firearm, id.  922(g).  The\r\ndistrict court sentenced five of the appellants to life\r\nimprisonment and the sixth, Vasquez, to 100 months in prison. \r\nThese appeals followed.  We affirm.\r\nI.  BACKGROUND\r\nWe offer a thumbnail sketch of the interrelationship\r\nbetween the appellants and the Latin Kings, taking the information\r\ncontained in the record in the light most congenial to the jury's\r\nverdict.  See United States v. Houlihan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196936\"><a href=\"/opinion/196936/united-states-v-houlihan/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1271</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1277 (1st\r\nCir. 1996).  We eschew an exposition of the other evidence,\r\npreferring to discuss that evidence in the body of the opinion as\r\nit pertains to our consideration of particular points raised by the\r\nappellants.\r\nThe Latin Kings originated in Chicago in the 1940s.  Over\r\ntime, the street gang's influence spread to other venues.  The\r\nmovement  migrated east to Providence in the early 1990s.  Though\r\nsome chapters  of the Latin Kings, called Charter Nations, require\r\nHispanic descent as a condition of membership, others (like the\r\nProvidence chapter) allow persons of all races and ethnicities to\r\njoin.\r\nMembers of the Latin Kings signal their affiliation by\r\nsporting beads and other accouterments (including tattoos) in the\r\ngang's colors   black and gold.  They pay dues, attend weekly\r\nmeetings, and undertake \"missions\" (a euphemism that covers an\r\narray of activities ranging from running errands to committing\r\nviolent crimes) when directed by gang leaders.  Respect and\r\nsecurity rank among the gang's paramount concerns:  the Latin Kings\r\nroutinely discipline members for disrespectful behavior or for\r\ndiscussing Latin King business with outsiders.  Discipline runs a\r\nlengthy gamut from the \"silent treatment\" (suspension of all\r\ncommunications with other gang members), to revocation of drug use\r\nprivileges, to a \"bounce\" (a time-controlled beating limited to\r\ncertain areas of the body), to death.\r\nThe Almighty Latin King Nation is a hierarchical\r\norganization, and each of the appellants held one or more\r\nleadership positions within the Providence chapter.  Sepulveda\r\nserved as the group's president (sometimes called \"Inca\").  Boyd\r\nserved as the vice-president (sometimes called \"Cacique\"), and\r\nlater succeeded Sepulveda as president.  Roman served as the chief\r\nenforcer (a position previously held by Lara and subsequently held\r\nby Perry), and replaced Boyd as vice-president.  Vasquez functioned\r\nas the group's philosopher and then graduated to the post of\r\ninvestigator.\r\nAgainst this backdrop, we proceed to survey the\r\nappellants' assignments of error.  We start with two issues\r\npertaining to jury selection and then treat three of the trial\r\ncourt's evidentiary rulings.  At that juncture, we address a series\r\nof Rule 29 claims.  Finally, we tackle a perceived problem with the\r\njury instructions.  To the extent that the appellants mount other\r\nclaims, we reject them out of hand, without elaboration.\r\nII.  JURY SELECTION ISSUES\r\nMost of the appellants join in two challenges related to\r\njury selection:  all save Perry argue that the jury pool was not\r\ncomposed of a fair cross-section of the community, and all\r\ncalumnize the prosecution's use of a peremptory challenge to strike\r\nan African-American prospective juror.  We find no merit in either\r\nof these assigned errors.\r\n              A.  The Fair Cross-Section Claim.\r\nThe Constitution affords a criminal defendant the right\r\nto a trial \"by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein\r\nthe crime shall have been committed.\"  U.S. Const. amend. VI.  This\r\nconstitutional command requires that juries be selected from a\r\nrepresentative cross-section of the community.  See Duren v.\r\nMissouri, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109965\"><a href=\"/opinion/109965/duren-v-missouri/\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">357</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 358-59, 363-64 (1979); Taylor v. Louisiana,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109133\"><a href=\"/opinion/109133/taylor-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">419</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">522</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 528 (1975).  Congress codified that requirement in\r\nthe Jury Selection and Service Act, (JSSA), 28 U.S.C.  1861.  The\r\nappellants assert that the venires from which the district court\r\nselected both their grand and petit juries defied this imperative. \r\nWe do not agree.\r\nThe appellants base their assertion on Rhode Island's\r\nfailure to comply with the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA),\r\n42 U.S.C.  1973gg to 1973gg-10 (1994).  This statute, known\r\ncolloquially as the motor voter law, took effect in Rhode Island on\r\nJanuary 1, 1995.  It requires states to accept voter registration\r\napplications in tandem with applications for drivers' licences and\r\nother permits, and to establish procedures to facilitate that\r\nprocess.  See id.  1973gg-2(a), 5(a).  Rhode Island has conceded\r\nthat it did not fully comply with the NVRA.  See League of Women\r\nVoters v. Rhode Island Bd. of Elections, No. 96-442ML (D.R.I. Sept.\r\n12, 1996) (consent decree).  Because the District of Rhode Island\r\nderives its jury wheel from the state's voter registration lists,\r\nsee In re Amended Juror Selection Plan, Misc. No. 75-209 (D.R.I.\r\nOct. 6, 1993), the appellants claim that this noncompliance\r\nrendered the District's jury venires unrepresentative and\r\ntransgressed both the Sixth Amendment and the JSSA.\r\nThis claim is fully preserved with respect to the five\r\nappellants who proffer it here.  Although only Sepulveda and Boyd\r\nmoved to dismiss the indictment on this basis, the district court\r\npermitted Lara, Roman, and Vasquez to adopt Sepulveda's and Boyd's\r\nposition.\r\nThough preserved, the claim is unavailing.  In order to\r\nestablish a fair cross-section violation under either the Sixth\r\nAmendment or the JSSA, a criminal defendant must make a tripartite\r\nshowing comprising cognizability (i.e., that the group alleged to\r\nbe excluded is a distinctive group), underrepresentation (i.e.,\r\nthat the group is not fairly and reasonably represented in the\r\nvenires from which juries are selected), and systematic exclusion\r\n(i.e., that the discerned underrepresentation is due to the group's\r\nsystematic exclusion from the jury-selection process).  See Duren,\r\n439 U.S. at 364; United States v. Royal,     F.3d    ,     (1st\r\nCir. 1999) [</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">179003</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4].  Assuming, arguendo, that the\r\nappellants have made the first of these three showings, they\r\nplainly have failed to satisfy either the second or third part of\r\nthe test.  Because the Duren test is conjunctive   the proponent of\r\na fair cross-section claim must satisfy all three of its elements\r\neither of these failings suffices to defeat the instant claims.\r\nWe start with underrepresentation.  A showing of\r\nunderrepresentation must be predicated on more than mere guesswork. \r\nSuch a showing requires competent proof (usually statistical in\r\nnature).  See, e.g., Duren, 439 U.S. at 364-65; United States v.\r\nPion, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"670674\"><a href=\"/opinion/670674/united-states-v-rene-m-pion/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 22-23 (1st Cir. 1994); see also United States v.\r\nHafen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"430611\"><a href=\"/opinion/430611/united-states-v-darrell-g-hafen/\"><span class=\"volume\">726</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 23-24 (1st Cir. 1984) (considering the\r\nstatistical methodologies that might be used to determine\r\nunderrepresentation and selecting the absolute disparity method). \r\nThe single supporting document filed in the district court in\r\nconnection with the appellants' motions to dismiss was an affidavit\r\nattesting to the legislative history and purposes of the NVRA, and\r\nthe genesis of the consent decree.  This affidavit does not supply\r\nany foundation for a finding that the representation of Hispanic\r\nvenirepersons in the District was unfair, unreasonable, or in any\r\nway disproportionate to their numbers in the community.\r\nA successful fair cross-section claim also requires\r\ncompetent proof of the systematic nature of the exclusionary\r\nmechanisms leading to the underrepresentation.  See Duren, 439 U.S.\r\nat 366-67; Royal,     F.3d at     [</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">179003</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4].  The\r\nsupporting affidavit in this case offers no reason to believe that\r\nany systematic exclusion of Hispanics occurred in the selection\r\nprocess, let alone that it caused any material underrepresentation. \r\nThe NVRA is addressed to heightening overall popular participation\r\nin federal elections, as well as to increasing voter registration\r\nby members of racial minorities.  See 42 U.S.C.  1973gg.  The\r\nnaked fact of Rhode Island's noncompliance with the statute\r\nprovides no insight into whether voter registration lists (and,\r\ntherefore, the jury wheel compiled from those lists) were skewed\r\nfor or against minorities if skewed at all.  Since the appellants'\r\nproffer does not identify any systemic shortcoming or operational\r\ndeficiency that would tend to lessen Hispanic representation in the\r\nmaster jury wheel disproportionately, it does not satisfy the third\r\npart of the Duren test.  See Pion, 25 F.3d at 22-23.\r\nIt follows inexorably from what we have said that the\r\ndistrict court did not err in rejecting the pretrial motions to\r\ndismiss the indictment for want of a fair cross-section.\r\n                  B.  The Batson Challenge.\r\nThe appellants unanimously claim that the prosecution\r\nimpermissibly used a peremptory challenge to banish a prospective\r\njuror, Bruce King, because of his race.  We rehearse the events\r\nthat undergird this complaint.\r\nRelatively late in the voir dire process, King, a black\r\nmale, was tentatively seated.  The district judge, the prosecutor,\r\nand several defense attorneys proceeded to question him. \r\nSepulveda's lawyer noted that the evidence would include allusions\r\nto racial epithets and mention of the fact that many Latin King\r\nchapters did not welcome African Americans.  He then asked whether\r\nsuch testimony might affect King's ability to decide the case. \r\nKing replied, \"I believe I can be a fair and impartial juror under\r\nany circumstance.\"  Upon hearing this declaration, Perry began to\r\napplaud.  The court silenced him and the voir dire continued.  When\r\nthe defense team had completed its interrogation of King, the\r\nprosecutor asked that Perry's effusion be placed on the record.  He\r\nthen queried King as to whether the applause made him\r\nuncomfortable.  King responded in the negative, explaining that he\r\ndid not know why Perry felt impelled to clap.\r\nBecause the prosecutor's questions suggested a concern\r\nover whether the incident would jeopardize King's ability to render\r\nan impartial verdict, Roman's counsel requested an opportunity to\r\ndiscuss the matter.  He debunked the notion that King had been\r\ncompromised and emphasized that King was one of very few potential\r\nblack jurors who might be eligible for service in the case   \r\nperhaps the only one.  Judge Lisi permitted King to leave for the\r\nday and reprimanded Perry, warning him that another outburst would\r\nresult in his removal from the courtroom.  The dialogue between the\r\ncourt and counsel then resumed.  The prosecutor summarized his\r\nposition and speculated that \"[i]f we can find other black jurors\r\nin the panel to sit,\" he might use a peremptory strike to eject\r\nKing from the jury.  The day's proceedings ended without resolving\r\nthe issue of King's continued service.\r\nThe next day, the prosecutor moved to excuse King for\r\ncause and the parties argued the point.  The district judge took\r\nthe matter under advisement overnight.  She ultimately denied the\r\nmotion, explaining:\r\n  On the record, that is, taking Mr. King's\r\nstatements at face value as I do, I do not\r\nbelieve that cause exists to remove him from\r\nthis panel.  . . .  [I]t appears from what I\r\nobserved here in the courtroom and what\r\noccurred on the record afterwards with the\r\ncolloquy between the Government and Mr. King,\r\nthat Mr. King was not affected by Mr. Perry's\r\naction.\r\n\nWhen the time arrived for the parties to exercise their\r\nperemptory strikes, the government challenged King.  The appellants\r\nbranded this strike race-based and violative of the Equal\r\nProtection Clause.  After hearing argument, the district court\r\noverruled their objections.  Because this decision resolves a mixed\r\nquestion of law and fact that is peculiarly fact-sensitive, we\r\nreview it for clear error.  See United States v. Bergodere, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195758\"><a href=\"/opinion/195758/united-states-v-bergodere/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">512</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 516 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\nIt is by now common ground that race is an\r\nunconstitutional proxy for juror competence and impartiality, and,\r\ntherefore, that criminal defendants have an equal protection right\r\nto jury selection procedures that are free from racial biases.  See\r\nPowers v. Ohio, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112570\"><a href=\"/opinion/112570/powers-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">400</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 404 (1991); Batson v. Kentucky, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111662\"><a href=\"/opinion/111662/batson-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 89 (1986); Bergodere, 40 F.3d at 515.  We have directed\r\nthe use of a three-part framework to aid in assessing the validity\r\nof an allegation that the prosecution stooped to employ a race-\r\nbased peremptory strike.  See Bergodere, 40 F.3d at 515 (citing,\r\ninter alia, Batson, 476 U.S. at 96-98).  This framework envisions\r\nthat:\r\n  [T]he defendant must make a prima facie\r\nshowing of discrimination in the prosecutor's\r\nlaunching of the strike.  If the defendant\r\nfulfills this requirement by establishing,\r\nsay, a prima facie case of a racially driven\r\nimpetus, then the prosecutor must proffer a\r\nrace-neutral explanation for having challenged\r\nthe juror. . . .  If the prosecutor complies,\r\nthen, at the third and final stage, the\r\ndistrict court must decide whether the\r\ndefendant has carried the ultimate burden of\r\nproving that the strike constituted purposeful\r\ndiscrimination on the basis of race.\r\n\nId. (citations and footnote omitted).  In deploying this framework,\r\nthe prosecutor's second-step burden of proffering a race-neutral\r\nexplanation for the strike \"is merely a burden of production, not\r\na burden of persuasion,\" and the defendant retains the devoir of\r\npersuasion throughout the course of the inquiry.  Id.\r\nIn this case, we can truncate the usual inquiry.  In the\r\ndistrict court, as here, the government tacitly acknowledged that\r\nthe defendants had (or could have) offered a prima facie showing\r\nthat the strike appeared discriminatory.  Thus, the first step of\r\nthe pavane need not detain us.  See Hernandez v. New York, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112601\"><a href=\"/opinion/112601/hernandez-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">352</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 359 (1991).\r\nAt the second step, the government must advance a race-\r\nneutral explanation for its peremptory challenge.  In an effort to\r\nmeet this requirement, the prosecutor pointed to Perry's applause,\r\ntheorizing that Perry might have been trying either to create an\r\naffinity with King or to intimidate him.  In either event, the\r\nprosecutor stated, he feared that King's impartiality would wane,\r\nparticularly after King learned of the atrocities that the\r\ngovernment ascribed to Perry and his confederates.  Although the\r\nappellants contended that this explanation was bogus, the district\r\njudge accepted it.  King was excused, and the empanelment\r\ncontinued.  When sworn, the jury included one juror who described\r\nhimself as Mexican and one who appeared non-Caucasian (but from\r\nwhom no racial information was elicited).\r\nWe discern no clear error in Judge Lisi's ruling.  In\r\norder to meet the second-step requirement, a prosecutor's\r\nexplanation need only be unrelated to race on its face.  At this\r\npoint, neither the persuasiveness of the explanation nor the\r\ncredibility of the prosecutor is at issue.  See Purkett v. Elem,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117934\"><a href=\"/opinion/117934/purkett-v-elem/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 768-69 (1995) (per curiam); Hernandez, 500 U.S. at\r\n360.  Perry's clearly inappropriate courtroom behavior and its\r\npotential effect on King's ability to serve as a juror are in no\r\nway related to race, and, thus, the proffered reason crosses this\r\nmodest threshold.  See, e.g., Purkett, 514 U.S. at 769 (finding\r\nprosecutor's explanation that strikes of black jurors were based on\r\nbeards and long, unkempt hair to be race-neutral for purposes of\r\nthe second Batson way station).\r\nThis leaves the third, and final, determination:  whether\r\nthe appellants have proven that the strike constituted racial\r\ndiscrimination.  This decision boils down to whether the appellants\r\nhave convinced the district court that the race-neutral explanation\r\nfurnished by the government rings hollow.  Because the question is\r\nintensely fact-driven and the answer often pivots on credibility,\r\nappellate tribunals must scrutinize the trial court's response\r\nunder a highly deferential glass.  See Hernandez, 500 U.S. at 364-\r\n65; Batson, 476 U.S. at 98 n.21.\r\nIn this case, the trier credited the government's\r\nexplanation:\r\n  I have heard the explanation of the Government\r\nand I have observed [the prosecutor's]\r\nreaction to Mr. Perry's applause.  And I\r\ncannot say that [the prosecutor's] challenge\r\nhere is based on race.  [His] challenge is\r\nbased, as he says, on conduct and on the\r\nconcern that he has   and quite frankly, that\r\nthe Court has   as to what effect Mr. Perry's\r\nmisbehavior would have on Juror King . . . .\r\n\nThe judge also noted that she had observed no pattern of\r\ndiscrimination in the government's use of its peremptory challenges\r\na fact that may be entitled to special weight in determining\r\nwhether a prosecutor's race-neutral explanation for a peremptory\r\nchallenge is pretextual.  See Hernandez, 500 U.S. at 363.\r\nThe appellants urge us to hold that Judge Lisi committed\r\nclear error in upholding the prosecutor's strike.  They assert that\r\nshe misunderstood the applicable legal standard, but the record\r\nbelies this ipse dixit.  They also harp on the prosecutor's earlier\r\nstatement that he might consider exercising a peremptory challenge\r\nagainst King if other black jurors were empaneled.  This statement,\r\nthe appellants say, suggests that the government in certain\r\ncircumstances would have left King on the jury solely because he\r\nwas black, thus proving that the prosecutor had race in mind and\r\ndeliberately injected it into the jury-selection calculus.  While\r\nwe do not defend the prosecutor's comment (which was both\r\ninsensitive and unfortunate), we find no clear error in the\r\ndistrict court's conclusion that the prosecutor's remark did not\r\ndiscredit his race-neutral explanation.  See Cumpiano v. Banco\r\nSantander P.R., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540783\"><a href=\"/opinion/540783/wilma-cumpiano-aka-wilma-cumpiano-sanchez-v-banco-santander-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 152 (1st Cir. 1990) (explaining that\r\nno clear error exists unless review \"on the whole of the record\"\r\ngenerates \"a strong, unyielding belief that a mistake has been\r\nmade\").\r\nThe governing principle, of course, is that a person's\r\nrace must be regarded as \"unrelated to his fitness as a juror.\" \r\nBatson, 476 U.S. at 87.  Here, the record makes manifest that Judge\r\nLisi took this principle fully into account, and her resolution of\r\nthe issue of pretext based on her assessment of the prosecutor's\r\ndemeanor and credibility cannot be disturbed.  Perry's paroxysm\r\ninjected an imponderable into the equation.  Trial lawyers\r\nunderstandably fear the unknown, and that fear, in itself, is not\r\nindicative of a race-based viewpoint.  When the prosecutor voiced\r\nthis sort of concern, the district judge was well-situated to\r\nassess his candor.  The judge did so here   and we will not second-\r\nguess her assessment.  After all, when the evidence gives rise to\r\ncompeting interpretations, each plausible, the factfinder's choice\r\nbetween them cannot be clearly erroneous.  See Smith v. F.W.

EVIDENTIARY ISSUES\r\nThe appellants level a number of criticisms relating to\r\nthe admission of evidence.  Only three of these criticisms warrant\r\ndiscussion.\r\n                 A.  Coconspirator Testimony.\r\nBoyd disputes the district court's admission of certain\r\nvideotaped statements under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E).  We sketch\r\nthe circumstances.\r\nThe government played videotapes for the jury during the\r\ntrial.  These videotapes had been secured with the cooperation of\r\na confidential informant, Jose Ortiz, at whose home Latin King\r\nmeetings sometimes were held.  The videotape about which Boyd\r\ncomplains includes a solitary mention of him by Roman while\r\ndiscussing how Mendez's murder came about.  Boyd contemporaneously\r\nobjected to the admission of this evidence against him on the\r\nground that it fell outside the scope of Rule 801(d)(2)(E).  He\r\nalso seasonably requested an instruction limiting the jury's\r\nconsideration of the evidence to other defendants.  The trial judge\r\noverruled the objection, admitted the evidence unconditionally, and\r\ndeclined to give the requested limiting instruction.\r\nWe review challenges to the admission of evidence for\r\nabuse of discretion.  See Williams v. Drake, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198058\"><a href=\"/opinion/198058/williams-v-drake/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 47 (1st\r\nCir. 1998).  On this basis, Boyd's challenge stumbles at the\r\nstarting gate.  His argument addresses the admissibility of the\r\nevidence solely in respect to the only charge on which the jury\r\nfound him guilty   the murder-in-aid-of-racketeering charge.  But\r\nBoyd was also tried on (albeit not found guilty of) racketeering\r\nand racketeering conspiracy charges under the Racketeer Influenced\r\nand Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C.  1962, and he\r\nconcedes that the tape was admissible against him vis--vis those\r\ncharges.\r\nThis concession is dispositive, for the designation of a\r\ndeclaration as non-hearsay under Rule 801(d)(2)(E) is neither\r\ncount-specific nor conspiracy-specific.  See United States v.\r\nInnamorati, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609734\"><a href=\"/opinion/609734/united-states-v-kenneth-innamorati-united-states-v-william-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">456</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 486 (1st Cir. 1993).  Subject to\r\nrelevancy and similar considerations, out-of-court statements of a\r\ndeclarant coconspirator, if made during and in furtherance of a\r\nconspiracy, are admissible for the truth of the matter asserted,\r\nregardless of whether the conspiracy furthered is charged or\r\nuncharged, see United States v. Candelaria-Silva, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198241\"><a href=\"/opinion/198241/united-states-v-candelaria-silva/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">698</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 706\r\n(1st Cir. 1998); United States v. Rivera, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196345\"><a href=\"/opinion/196345/united-states-v-guzman-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7 (1st Cir.\r\n1995), and regardless of whether it is identical to or different\r\nfrom the crime that the statements are offered to prove, see\r\nInnamorati, 996 F.2d at 486.  Hence, the trial court did not abuse\r\nits discretion in overruling Boyd's objection.\r\nWe think that the court also appropriately refused Boyd's\r\nrequest for a limiting instruction.  When the government proffered\r\nthe videotape, Boyd requested an instruction that \"the jury c[ould]\r\nnot consider the statements of Shariff Roman as substantive\r\nevidence or proof that Boyd participated in the murder of Mendez.\" \r\nBut the Mendez murder was not charged against Boyd merely as a\r\nviolent crime in aid of racketeering, 18 U.S.C.  1959(a)(1), but\r\nalso was charged as one of the predicate acts in the RICO count,\r\nid.  1962(c).  As Boyd concedes, the challenged statements were\r\nadmissible non-hearsay evidence as to the latter count.  Thus, the\r\njury was entitled to consider the relevant portions of Roman's\r\nstatements on that count as to all the defendants (Boyd included). \r\nOn this basis, the proposed instruction   which swept broadly\r\nrather than asking narrowly that the jury disregard the statements\r\nin respect to the separate charge that the murder was a violent\r\ncrime in aid of racketeering   would at best have been confusing,\r\nand at worst, legally erroneous.  It is, of course, hornbook law\r\nthat a party cannot rewardingly assign error to a trial court's\r\nrefusal to give a confusing, misleading, or legally incorrect\r\ninstruction.  See United States v. DeStefano, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196179\"><a href=\"/opinion/196179/united-states-v-destefano/\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 4 (1st\r\nCir. 1995); United States v. David, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566001\"><a href=\"/opinion/566001/united-states-v-shmuel-david-united-states-of-america-v-jaime-toro/\"><span class=\"volume\">940</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">722</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 738 (1st Cir.\r\n1991).\r\nIn all events, we need not linger over this point,\r\ninasmuch as the videotape is not significantly inculpatory as to\r\nBoyd's involvement in the commission of the Mendez murder.  The\r\nonly statement on the tape that relates to Boyd at all occurs when\r\nRoman says that, at the time of the murder, \"Bullet was, um, in\r\nTraining School still, you know what I mean?\"  This statement, on\r\nits face, is benign (perhaps exculpatory).  Still, in a feat of\r\nlinguistic legerdemain, the government construed this statement at\r\ntrial to mean that Boyd had escaped from the Training School, and\r\nthus was available when the Latin Kings contrived the murder plot. \r\nEven if this odd interpretation is accepted, however, the statement\r\nonly showed that Boyd was available at the time of the Mendez\r\nmurder.  Since several percipient witnesses testified not only to\r\nhis availability, but also to his actual presence at the meetings\r\nin which the Latin Kings planned Mendez's murder, any error in\r\nrefusing to give the requested instruction was harmless because\r\nthere was no \"realistic possibility that admission of the evidence\r\ninfluenced the outcome of the trial\" as to Boyd's guilt on the\r\nsingle count of conviction (commission of a violent crime in aid of\r\nracketeering).

Testimony of Cooperating Witnesses.\r\nDuring the trial, the government offered the testimony of\r\nseveral cooperating witnesses, who testified in return for promises\r\nthat they would not be charged federally for certain crimes and/or\r\nfor recommendations of lenient sentencing in respect to crimes for\r\nwhich they had been or would be charged.  Five of the appellants\r\n(Boyd excluded) insist that the lower court should have barred\r\nthese witnesses from testifying, and that its failure to do so\r\nnecessitates a new trial.\r\nThe appellants pin their hopes on a witness-bribery\r\nstatute which provides in relevant part:\r\n  Whoever . . . directly or indirectly, gives,\r\noffers or promises anything of value to any\r\nperson, for or because of the testimony under\r\noath or affirmation given or to be given by\r\nsuch person as a witness upon a trial,\r\nhearing, or other proceeding, before any court\r\n. . . authorized by the laws of the United\r\nStates to hear evidence or take testimony . .\r\n. shall be fined under this title or\r\nimprisoned for not more than two years, or\r\nboth.\r\n\n18 U.S.C.  201(c)(2).

Today, we make our\r\nposition explicit and unqualified.\r\nThere are several reasons why section 201(c)(2) cannot be\r\ninvoked as a bright-line barrier to the government's use of\r\nwitnesses whose cooperation has been secured by agreements not to\r\nprosecute or by promises of recommended leniency.  The most basic\r\nreason is that section 201(c)(2) does not apply at all to the\r\nfederal sovereign qua prosecutor.  Accord Ramsey, 165 F.3d at 987-\r\n90; Haese, 162 F.3d at 366-67; Ware, 161 F.3d at 418-21.  After\r\nall, \"[s]tatutes of general purport do not apply to the United\r\nStates unless Congress makes the application clear and\r\nindisputable,\" Singleton II, 165 F.3d at 1300, and Congress has\r\ntaken no such steps in respect to this statute.  Reliance on this\r\ntenet is particularly apt where, as here, the failure to honor it\r\nwould divest the government of a long-established prerogative and,\r\nin the bargain, lead to an eccentric result.  See Nardone v. United\r\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102883\"><a href=\"/opinion/102883/nardone-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">302</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">379</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 383 (1937).\r\nWe add, moreover, that the Singleton I panel's reading of\r\nsection 201(c)(2) cannot be correct because such a reading would\r\npreclude enforcement or limit the efficacy of the terms of several\r\nmore recent   and more specific   statutes, all of which presuppose\r\nthe potential use of testimony in exchange for non-prosecution\r\nagreements, leniency recommendations, and/or other valuable\r\npromises.  See, e.g., 28 U.S.C.  994(n) (authorizing the\r\nSentencing Commission to include in the sentencing guidelines a\r\nmechanism by which courts may reduce sentences to account for\r\nconvicted defendants' substantial assistance); 18 U.S.C.  3521\r\n(providing for government-subsidized relocation and protection of\r\nwitnesses in return for their testimony); 18 U.S.C.  6002, 6003\r\n(allowing prosecutors to obtain orders compelling witnesses to\r\ntestify despite potential self-incrimination, in return for\r\nimmunity from prosecution based on that testimony).  These\r\nenactments would be crippled, if not rendered utterly meaningless,\r\nwere we to follow the siren's call of Singleton I.  Courts\r\ngenerally adhere to the principle that statutes relating to the\r\nsame subject matter should be construed harmoniously if possible,\r\nand if not, that more recent or specific statutes should prevail\r\nover older or more general ones.  See HCSC-Laundry v. United\r\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110412\"><a href=\"/opinion/110412/hcsc-laundry-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 6 (1981); Morton v.

Singer, Statutes and Statutory\r\nConstruction  51.02-03 (1992).  There is no basis for eschewing\r\nthat time-tested principle in this instance.\r\nAt the risk of carting coal to Newcastle, we briefly note\r\ntwo other bases for disavowing Singleton I.  First, it is at least\r\narguable that section 201(c)(2) should not apply to the government\r\nbecause the Dictionary Act, 1 U.S.C.  1, which creates a frame of\r\nreference for parsing statutes, defines the word \"whoever\" to\r\ninclude \"corporations, companies, associations, firms,\r\npartnerships, societies, and joint stock companies, as well as\r\nindividuals,\" but does not define the word to include the United\r\nStates.  Id.; see also Ramsey, 165 F.3d at 987.  Second, even if\r\nsection 201(c)(2) were applicable to the testimony of cooperating\r\nwitnesses, the appropriate penalty for the use at trial of\r\ntestimony obtained in derogation of the statute most likely would\r\nbe a fine or imprisonment (as prescribed by the statute itself),\r\nnot resort to a judicially-crafted exclusionary rule.  See United\r\nStates v. Condon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762441\"><a href=\"/opinion/762441/united-states-v-thomas-condon/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>  <span class=\"page\">687</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 689 (7th Cir. 1999); Ramsey, 165\r\nF.3d at 991.\r\nWe have said enough on this score.  We hold, without\r\nserious question, that 18 U.S.C.  201(c)(2) does not bar the\r\ngovernment from promising leniency or the like to cooperating\r\nwitnesses.  Accordingly, the district court did not err in\r\nadmitting the contested testimony.\r\n               C.  Scope of Cross-Examination.\r\nPerry, who testified at trial in his own defense, strives\r\nto persuade us that the district court gave the government too free\r\nrein in cross-examination.  We are unconvinced.\r\nPerry's thesis is that the challenged cross-examination\r\nexceeded the scope of direct examination and, therefore, should\r\nhave been foreclosed.  This thesis rests primarily on the first\r\nsentence of Fed. R. Evid. 611(b), which reads:  \"Cross-examination\r\nshould be limited to the subject matter of the direct examination\r\nand matters affecting the credibility of the witness.\"  Perry notes\r\nthat his direct examination consisted of only ten questions,\r\nrestricted to the Vandergroen carjacking and its sequelae.  See\r\ninfra Part IV(A)(2) (describing this carjacking).  Yet, the trial\r\ncourt allowed the prosecutor, over objection, to cross-question\r\nPerry not only about the carjacking, but also about other crimes of\r\nwhich he and his codefendants were accused (including the Mendez\r\nmurder and two attempted homicides charged as predicate acts in the\r\nRICO conspiracy count), and about a draft of a letter seized from\r\nhis jail cell in which he accused his former girlfriend of\r\n\"snitching\" and requested that she be silenced.\r\nWe review district court rulings anent the scope of\r\ncross-examination solely for abuse of discretion.  See United\r\nStates v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198012\"><a href=\"/opinion/198012/united-states-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">458</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 462 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 119 S.\r\nCt. 383 (1998); United States v.

We find none here.  It is standard fare for cross-\r\nexaminers to inquire into issues not mentioned on direct\r\nexamination, but related to and made relevant by that examination. \r\nSee McGautha v. California, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108329\"><a href=\"/opinion/108329/mcgautha-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">183</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 215 (1971).  It is\r\nequally standard   and equally proper   for a cross-examiner to\r\ndelve into matters which, although not mentioned on direct\r\nexamination, bear on the witness's credibility.  See id. \r\nCollectively, these two categories envelop the questions that Perry\r\nchallenges.  We explain briefly.\r\nThe indictment charged the Vandergroen carjacking as a\r\npredicate act within the RICO conspiracy and as a violent crime in\r\naid of racketeering.  At trial, the government asserted that\r\nVandergroen's disrespect of Perry offended the Latin King code and\r\nled Perry to target him.  During the government's case in chief, at\r\nleast two witnesses testified in support of this theory.  Because\r\nPerry's direct examination included a denial that the Vandergroen\r\nincident had anything to do with the Latin Kings, the government\r\nwas entitled to test the veracity of this denial.  One way of doing\r\nso was to interrogate Perry about other crimes that he had\r\ncommitted under the organization's auspices.\r\nIn his direct testimony, Perry also endeavored to\r\nexonerate Lara, portraying him on direct examination as unaware  \r\nuntil it was too late   that either the carjacking or the killing\r\nwould transpire.  On cross-examination, the government sought to\r\nshow that this version of events conflicted with Perry's earlier\r\nstatement to the police and to suggest that he was covering for\r\nLara as part of his perceived duty as a Latin King not to \"rat\" on\r\nfellow gang members.  It was in this context that the prosecutor\r\nasked about the correspondence in which Perry solicited punishment\r\nfor his loose-lipped girlfriend.  Thus, we detect no abuse of\r\ndiscretion in Judge Lisi's determination that these lines of cross-\r\nquestioning were not beyond the scope of Perry's direct\r\nexamination.\r\nWe hasten to add that, even were we to conclude that the\r\nchallenged questions exceeded the scope of direct examination, we\r\nnonetheless would uphold the judge's rulings.  Perry's\r\nanimadversions largely overlook the second sentence of Rule 611(b),\r\nwhich empowers trial courts, \"in the exercise of discretion, [to]\r\npermit inquiry into additional matters as if on direct\r\nexamination.\"  Fed. R. Evid. 611(b).   This authorization confers\r\ndiscretion on trial judges to disregard the first sentence of Rule\r\n611(b) and allow cross-examination to extend into areas not\r\nexplored on direct.  See Losacco v.

In this instance, the challenged\r\nquestions occupied only a fraction of the cross-examination and\r\nbore a close relationship to major trial issues.  Thus, whether or\r\nnot the questions fell within the scope of the direct examination,\r\nwe could not say that the trial judge's overruling of Perry's\r\nobjections constituted an abuse of discretion.\r\nIV.  SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\r\nWe next address the denial of Lara's, Boyd's, and Roman's\r\nmotions for judgment of acquittal under Fed. R. Crim. P. 29.  In\r\nreviewing such denials, the court of appeals affords plenary review\r\nand applies precisely the same regimen that obtains in the trial\r\ncourt.  This regimen entails considering the evidence in the light\r\nmost favorable to the prosecution and determining whether this body\r\nof proof, as a whole, has sufficient bite to ground a reasoned\r\nconclusion that the government proved each of the elements of the\r\ncharged crime beyond a reasonable doubt.  See United States v.\r\nValle, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196494\"><a href=\"/opinion/196494/united-states-v-valle/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 216-17 (1st Cir. 1995); United States v.\r\nOlbres, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196204\"><a href=\"/opinion/196204/united-states-v-olbres/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 970 (1st Cir. 1995).  This prosecution-\r\nfriendly standard requires the resolution of all evidentiary\r\ndisputes and credibility questions in favor of the government, and\r\nalso requires the acceptance of those reasonable inferences from\r\nthe evidence (whether or not inevitable) that support the\r\ngovernment's view of the case.  See United States v. Carroll, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"734111\"><a href=\"/opinion/734111/united-states-v-christopher-b-carroll/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">740</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 742 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1258</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1997).  The\r\njury's verdict must stand unless the record, viewed from this coign\r\nof vantage, would not allow a rational jury to find the defendant\r\nguilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  See id.; see also Olbres, 61\r\nF.3d at 970.  With these criteria in mind, we turn to the specifics\r\nof the appellants' claims.\r\n                    A.  Lara's Challenges.\r\nLara contests the sufficiency of the evidence in regard\r\nto two separate convictions.  We discuss these initiatives\r\nsequentially.\r\n1.  Witness Intimidation.  Initially, Lara attacks his\r\nconviction for intimidating a government witness, Manuel Pacheco\r\n(variously referred to as \"Manny\" or \"Joey\").  As it applies in\r\nthis case, the statute of conviction requires the government to\r\nprove two elements:  (i) that the defendant knowingly used\r\nintimidation, physical force, or threats against another, and (ii)\r\nthat this conduct was intended to \"influence, delay, or prevent the\r\ntestimony of any person in an official proceeding.\"  18 U.S.C. \r\n1512(b)(1).  The term \"official proceeding\" encompasses both\r\nfederal criminal trials and grand jury sessions.  See id. \r\n1515(a)(1)(A); see also United States v. Victor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"589960\"><a href=\"/opinion/589960/united-states-v-eugene-vivian-victor-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">973</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">975</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 978\r\n(1st Cir. 1992).\r\nThe facts, marshaled in the light most flattering to the\r\ngovernment, amply support the jury's verdict on this count.  The\r\njury reasonably could have found that Pacheco aided the authorities\r\nin their investigation of the Latin Kings, that the organization's\r\ntop brass suspected as much, and that they feared that Pacheco had\r\nappeared (or would soon do so) as a witness before the grand jury\r\nand/or at an ensuing trial.  In November 1994, Sepulveda (then the\r\npresident of the Providence chapter) ordered Pacheco's\r\n\"termination\" (a disposition which, in Latin King parlance, might\r\nmean anything from a beating to a slaying).\r\nAt the time, Pacheco was housed in the Rhode Island state\r\npenitentiary (as was Lara).  Vasquez and two fellow Latin Kings\r\n(Alex Mesa and Rodney Santi) were dispatched to explain the\r\nsituation and communicate the order to a pickup team of\r\nincarcerated Latin Kings.  At the penitentiary, the three\r\nmessengers visited one on one with a trio of Latin King inmates\r\n(Lara, Kareem Abdulla, and Edson Toro) and carried out their\r\nassignment.  To be specific, Vasquez met with Lara, Mesa with\r\nAbdulla, and Santi with Toro.  The following evening, Lara,\r\nAbdulla, Toro, and a fourth incarcerated Latin King, Richard\r\nRodriguez, approached Pacheco in a dark corner of the prison yard. \r\nThe group surrounded Pacheco and taunted him about being a \"rat.\" \r\nHe was then struck from behind and savagely beaten.\r\nLara declares that this evidence is inadequate because no\r\ndirect testimony showed that he received the termination order\r\n(indeed, Vasquez testified to the contrary) or participated in\r\nadministering the beating.  These declarations comprise more cry\r\nthan wool.  Mesa and Santi testified that they rode to the prison\r\nwith Vasquez, that the three of them discussed the termination\r\norder en route, and that they each relayed the message to the\r\ninmate with whom they spoke.  Vasquez signed the prison's visitor\r\nlog.  He admitted visiting with Lara.  Pacheco testified that Lara\r\nhad been in the group that surrounded him and had been behind him\r\nwhen he was struck from the rear.\r\nAlthough this evidence is largely circumstantial, the\r\njury reasonably could have disbelieved Vasquez's self-serving\r\ndenial and inferred that he followed orders (as his fellow\r\nmessengers had) and communicated the directive to Lara.  By like\r\ntoken, the jury reasonably could have credited Pacheco's account\r\nand thus inferred that Lara participated in the beating.  Any\r\ndivergent view of the evidence would elevate coincidence to an art\r\nform.  The proof, therefore, was sufficient to convict on the\r\nwitness intimidation count.  See United States v. Castro-Lara, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587572\"><a href=\"/opinion/587572/united-states-v-ramon-castro-lara-united-states-of-america-v-abraham/\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">976</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 981 (1st Cir. 1992) (explaining that \"circumstantial\r\nevidence, in and of itself, is often enough to ground a\r\nconviction\"); see also Carroll, 105 F.3d at 743 (noting, in the\r\ncontext of rejecting an insufficiency challenge, the reticence of\r\nappellate courts to \"second-guess\" a jury's credibility judgments).\r\n2.  Carjacking.  Lara and Perry were convicted of a\r\ncarjacking on September 6, 1994.  This scenario involved Temujin\r\nVandergroen, who apparently precipitated the incident by playing\r\nwith a knife in front of Perry's children.  Perry interpreted this\r\nas a sign of disrespect, intolerable to a Latin King, and asked\r\nLara to accompany him while he relieved Vandergroen of his Ford\r\nEscort (which was adorned with tire rims that Perry fancied).\r\nThe two men asked Vandergroen to take a ride with them. \r\nWhen he agreed, Perry (who had brought along a sawed-off shotgun)\r\nsat behind Vandergroen in the car, while Lara sat in the front\r\npassenger seat.  At Perry's request, Vandergroen drove to a\r\ndeserted neighborhood.  Perry then told Vandergroen to slow or stop\r\nthe vehicle, and, when Vandergroen complied, Perry shot him.  Perry\r\nand Lara shoved Vandergroen's body into the street and returned to\r\na Latin King hangout, where they were seen with blood and brain\r\nmatter on their clothing.  The two later burned and abandoned the\r\ncar.\r\nOn these facts, the jury convicted Lara of carjacking in\r\nviolation of 18 U.S.C.  2119(3).  Lara attacks the sufficiency of\r\nthe evidence from an odd angle.  He does not allege that the\r\ngovernment failed to prove that he committed specific elements of\r\nthe offense, but, rather, claims that the only witness whose\r\ntestimony implicated him in the carjacking (Pacheco) was\r\nunreliable.  This attack is impuissant.  In the usual case, the\r\ncredibility of witnesses is for the jury, see Carroll, 105 F.3d at\r\n743; United States v. Laboy-Delgado, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196771\"><a href=\"/opinion/196771/united-states-v-laboy-delgado/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 27 (1st Cir.\r\n1996), and there is nothing here that mitigates against the\r\nconventional application of this rule.  There were conflicting\r\naccounts of Lara's participation in the carjacking, and the jury\r\nwas free to decide which, if any, to believe.\r\nLara has a fallback position.  Perry had given testimony\r\nexculpating Lara from complicity in the Vandergroen carjacking. \r\nSee supra Part III(C).  Lara hypothesizes that Perry's disgusting\r\ncourtroom conduct, see United States v. Perry, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197443\"><a href=\"/opinion/197443/united-states-v-perry/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">952</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 954\r\n(1st Cir. 1997), unfairly undercut this exculpatory testimony. \r\nBut there is simply no evidence that Perry's conduct prejudiced the\r\njury against Lara.  When a defendant presses a plausible claim of\r\nspillover effect, differentiated verdicts often constitute tangible\r\nevidence of the jury's enduring ability to distinguish between the\r\nculpability of codefendants.  See, e.g., United States v. Flores-\r\nRivera, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196112\"><a href=\"/opinion/196112/united-states-v-flores-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 326 n.2 (1st Cir. 1995).  This case is of that\r\nstripe:   even after Perry's dramatic display, the jury acquitted\r\nLara, but convicted Perry, on several counts, including the charge\r\nof using or carrying a firearm during the Vandergroen carjacking. \r\nThen, too, the trial judge instructed the jurors soon after Perry's\r\ngaffe that they should draw no adverse inference therefrom against\r\nany defendant (Perry included).  See Perry, 116 F.3d at 954.  This\r\ntimely instruction further supports the conclusion that Lara was\r\nnot prejudiced by Perry's actions.  See Richardson v. Marsh, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111865\"><a href=\"/opinion/111865/richardson-v-marsh/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 206 (1987) (remarking \"the almost invariable assumption\r\nof the law that jurors follow their instructions\"); United States\r\nv.

Boyd's and Roman's Challenge.\r\nBoyd and Roman challenge the sufficiency of the evidence\r\nto support their convictions for committing a violent crime (the\r\nmurder of Jose Mendez) in aid of racketeering.  The relevant facts,\r\nstated from the perspective most conducive to the verdict, are as\r\nfollows.\r\nOn Saturday, November 5, 1994, several members of the\r\nProvidence Latin Kings attended a party in Connecticut.  On that\r\noccasion, they learned that their Connecticut counterparts were at\r\nwar with a rival gang, the Netas.  Two Connecticut Latin Kings\r\nreturned to Rhode Island with the Providence contingent.  One of\r\nthem, Peter Natal, later became a confidential informant.\r\nAt a meeting of the Providence chapter held on Monday,\r\nNovember 7, Sepulveda told his cohorts about the war in\r\nConnecticut.  Immediately after this announcement, the officers of\r\nthe Providence chapter (including, at least, Sepulveda, Boyd, and\r\nRoman) went into executive session and discussed a plan to kill the\r\nleader of the Netas in Providence.  This strategy was hatched on\r\nthe theory that, in Sepulveda's words, \"without the head, the body\r\nfalls.\"  The executive session ended on this note, the main meeting\r\nresumed, and Sepulveda asked the general membership to forget what\r\nhe had said about a war.\r\nNatal attended the executive session.  He testified that,\r\nduring this discussion, the Latin King hierarchs noted the near-\r\ndearth of local Netas; Providence was virgin territory and there\r\nwere only four full members of the Neta gang at that point.  Mesa\r\nconfirmed this assessment.  He testified that \"there was [sic] very\r\nfew Netas out here.  There's probably like four Netas.  Each one\r\nhad a position [i.e., held an office in the gang].\"  Initially,\r\nthere was confusion over whether Jose Mendez might be the president\r\nof the Providence Netas, but a consensus gradually developed in\r\nfavor of the view that Winston Navarette held that office.\r\nAfter the meeting adjourned, several participants\r\nrepaired to the dwelling that Roman shared with his then-paramour,\r\nTia Barboza.  A small group, including Boyd and Roman, met in Tia's\r\nbedroom and finalized the plan to kill the head of the Netas.  Four\r\nmembers were assigned responsibility for carrying out the\r\nassassination:  Perry, Santi, Hakim Davis, and Juan Garcia. \r\nWitnesses stated that Boyd and Roman each chose at least one member\r\nof the \"hit squad.\"  The next day, Roman distributed weapons from\r\nthe gang's cache to the appointees.\r\nIn retrospect, it appears that, at the crucial time, the\r\nProvidence Netas had four officers:  Winston Navarette (president),\r\nJose Mendez (vice-president), Edgar Pichardo (disciplinarian), and\r\nMaquiva Mendez (secretary).  The Netas lived together.  When the\r\nhit squad arrived at their abode, they asked for Navarette and were\r\ninformed that he was out of town.  The trial testimony was\r\nunequivocal that when the Neta president was away, the vice-\r\npresident assumed his responsibilities.  Thus, Jose Mendez,\r\nnominally the Neta vice-president, was the head of the Netas in\r\nNavarette's absence.\r\nUpon learning of Navarette's unavailability, the crew\r\ninvited Jose Mendez, who was wearing his Neta colors at the time,\r\nto smoke some marijuana.  The group, now five in number, walked to\r\na nearby field where Perry shot Mendez from behind, killing him. \r\nThe four Latin Kings fled.\r\nBoyd claims that this evidence failed to link him\r\nsufficiently to Mendez's murder.  He argues that even the most\r\ngenerous view of the evidence fails to support the jury's verdict\r\nbecause there was no evidence (1) that the plan was to kill\r\nwhomever was the Neta leader, (2) that the shooter was aware that\r\nhis target was the de facto leader, or (3) that the shooter knew\r\nMendez had become the de facto leader of the Netas in Navarette's\r\nabsence.\r\nBefore coming to grips with these arguments, we address\r\na procedural issue.  Roman did not raise the sufficiency question\r\nin his opening brief, but, after perusing Boyd's brief, sought\r\nleave from this court to adopt the argument.  By order entered\r\nFebruary 1, 1999, we granted this request provisionally, subject to\r\na final determination after the case was heard.\r\nThe standard for adoption of arguments by reference\r\ninvolves a determination of whether the arguments are \"readily\r\ntransferrable from the proponent's case to the adopter's case.\" \r\nDavid, 940 F.2d at 737.  We ordinarily look with disfavor upon\r\nattempts to adopt factbound arguments by reference.  See, e.g.,\r\nCastro-Lara, 970 F.2d at 982; David, 940 F.2d at 737.  Under the\r\npeculiar circumstances of this case, however, we allow the\r\nadoption.  Roman, like Boyd, moved for judgment of acquittal below,\r\nand relied on the same three grounds in support of his claim that\r\nthe evidence was insufficient to convict him of Mendez's murder. \r\nMore importantly, although the evidence as to each varies on the\r\nfirst two grounds, Boyd's arguments are generally relevant to\r\nRoman, who, like Boyd, was a part of the officers' meetings, but\r\nnot a member of the crew sent to carry out the execution.  Thus,\r\nthe David \"ready transferability\" standard is satisfied and we will\r\nentertain the insufficiency claims of both appellants.\r\nBoyd's and Roman's first two points are easily\r\ndispatched.  Davis, a first-hand participant, described the plan\r\nand the implementing order as being aimed at killing the head of\r\nthe Netas.  This order was given in the presence, and with the\r\nacquiescence, of Boyd and Roman.  It was designed as a preemptive\r\nstrike on the Neta leadership.\r\nAlthough some of the witnesses whose testimony the\r\ngovernment hawks had made prior inconsistent statements, the same\r\nis true for several witnesses whose testimony Boyd and Roman\r\nespouse.  The jurors were entitled to choose which witnesses to\r\ncredit, and, in the posture of a sufficiency-of-the-evidence\r\nchallenge, we must assume that they credited those witnesses whose\r\ntestimony lent support to the verdict.  See Carroll, 105 F.3d at\r\n742-43; Laboy-Delgado, 84 F.3d at 27-28.  At any rate, jurors are\r\nnot required to discard testimony that appears to contain internal\r\ninconsistencies, but may credit some parts of a witness's testimony\r\nand disregard other potentially contradictory portions.  See United\r\nStates v. O'Brien, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"661452\"><a href=\"/opinion/661452/43-socsecrepser-489-medicaremedicaid-guide-p-42092-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 707 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\nThe third deficiency to which Boyd and Roman allude is\r\nmore nettlesome.  The government offered no direct evidence that\r\nthe shooter (Perry) knew of Jose Mendez's position as de facto\r\nleader of the Netas at the time of the murder.  Still, direct\r\nevidence is not essential to proof of criminality.  See id. at 706-\r\n07; Castro-Lara, 970 F.2d at 981; United States v. Ortiz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584511\"><a href=\"/opinion/584511/united-states-v-ruben-ortiz-aka-ruben-ortiz-de-jesus-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">966</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">707</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 711 (1st Cir. 1992).  In this instance, the circumstantial\r\nevidence is telling:  the proof (particularly the testimony of\r\nNatal and Mesa) showed that at least some Latin Kings knew there\r\nwere only four full-fledged members of the Netas in Providence, and\r\nthat all of them were officers of the gang.  Mendez's name was\r\nbandied about at the executive session (which both Boyd and Roman\r\nattended) as the possible head of the Netas.  Although consensus\r\nlater formed around the idea that Navarette occupied the top rung\r\non the ladder, the discussion of Mendez's involvement strongly\r\nsuggests that the Latin King leadership was keenly aware that he\r\nheld a relatively high position in the Netas.\r\nWe have held before that evidence of events that occur\r\nsubsequent to the commission of a crime can shed light upon an\r\nactor's guilt vel non.  See, e.g., United States v. Sutton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587576\"><a href=\"/opinion/587576/united-states-v-arthur-sutton/\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1001</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1007 (1st Cir. 1992); United States v. Mena, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"561243\"><a href=\"/opinion/561243/united-states-v-edward-ramon-mena/\"><span class=\"volume\">933</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 25 n.5 (1st Cir. 1991).  In this instance, evidence of the\r\nLatin King leaders' reaction to the murder bolsters the\r\ngovernment's case.  Davis recalled that Sepulveda, then the Latin\r\nKing president, responded to the report of Mendez's demise by\r\nremarking that the hit squad had done a good job.  Moreover, the\r\nLatin Kings did not mount a manhunt for Navarette after the Mendez\r\nmurder because, in Davis's words, their \"mission\" had been\r\ncompleted successfully.\r\nJurors are entitled to draw reasonable inferences from\r\nproven facts.  On this record, we think that two key inferences are\r\nsupportable.  First, the jury reasonably could have inferred that\r\nPerry was aware of Mendez's leadership role in the Netas.  Second,\r\nthe jury reasonably could have inferred that when the hit squad\r\nencountered Mendez, its members believed that he was likely the\r\nhighest available member of the Neta leadership and killed him for\r\nthat reason, in compliance with the order that had issued.  Boyd's\r\nand Roman's alternate hypothesis   that Navarette's absence foiled\r\nthe plot, and that Perry killed Mendez in order to satisfy his\r\nbloodlust   was not implausible, but the jury rejected it in favor\r\nof a finding that Perry pulled the trigger to effect the directive\r\nthat had been handed down by the Latin King hierarchs.  This choice\r\nfell well within the jury's proper purview.  See United States v.\r\nGifford, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195222\"><a href=\"/opinion/195222/united-states-v-gifford/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">462</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 467 (1st Cir. 1994) (noting that the evidence\r\n\"need not rule out other hypotheses more congenial to a finding of\r\ninnocence\" in order to defeat a Rule 29 motion).  Thus, we conclude\r\nthat the evidence suffices to sustain the disputed convictions. \r\nSee Bourjaily v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111938\"><a href=\"/opinion/111938/bourjaily-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">171</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 179-80 (1987)\r\n(explaining that \"individual pieces of evidence, insufficient in\r\nthemselves to prove a point, may in cumulation prove it\"); Stewart\r\nv.

JURY INSTRUCTIONS\r\nLara offers several complaints about the district court's\r\njury instructions on the carjacking count.  Only one of these\r\npoints deserves comment.\r\nTracking the applicable statute, 18 U.S.C.  2119(3) (see\r\nsupra note 5), the court instructed the jury that it must find four\r\nelements in order to convict:  (1) that the named defendants (Lara\r\nand Perry), by means of force or violence, (2) took from the person\r\nor presence of Vandergroen a motor vehicle (3) that previously had\r\nbeen transported, shipped, or received in interstate or foreign\r\ncommerce, and (4) that one or both of the named defendants\r\npossessed a firearm at the time.  Lara's most fervent challenge,\r\nproperly preserved, concerns the court's elaboration upon the\r\nfourth element.  The court stated:\r\n  [T]he government must prove that at least one\r\nof the two defendants was in possession of a\r\nfirearm.  A person has possession of something\r\nif the person knows of its presence and has\r\nphysical control of it, or has the power and\r\nintention to control it.  More than one person\r\ncan be in possession of something if each\r\nknows of its presence and has the power and\r\nintention to control it.\r\n\nLara condemns this instruction because it allowed the jury to\r\nconvict him although only Perry actually possessed a firearm.  And\r\nto illustrate the harmfulness of this error, Lara points out that\r\nthe jury acquitted him on a related charge of using or carrying a\r\nfirearm during a crime of violence, 18 U.S.C.  924(c).\r\nIn the face of properly preserved objections, we evaluate\r\nchallenged jury instructions under an abuse of discretion rubric,\r\nconsidering the charge as a whole.  See DeStefano, 59 F.3d at 2-3;\r\nUnited States v. Cintolo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488517\"><a href=\"/opinion/488517/united-states-v-william-j-cintolo/\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">980</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1003 (1st Cir. 1987).  So\r\nviewed, Judge Lisi's possession instruction passes muster.  The\r\nindictment charged Lara not only as a principal in the carjacking,\r\nbut also as an aider and abettor under 18 U.S.C.  2.  In her\r\ninstructions, Judge Lisi described the workings of the latter\r\nstatute in considerable detail, stating, inter alia, \"you may find\r\na defendant guilty of the offense charged if you find beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt that the government has proven that another person\r\nactually committed the offense with which the defendant is charged,\r\nand that the defendant aided, abetted, induced, or procured that\r\nperson to commit the offense.\"  She later described the carjacking\r\ncount as charging Perry and Lara with having violated both section\r\n2119(3) and section 2.  Thus, under the instructions, as long as\r\nthe jury found that either Perry or Lara intended to take\r\nVandergroen's vehicle by forcible or violent means and carried a\r\nfirearm to that end, the other defendant could be found guilty as\r\nan aider and abettor if he knew of the plan and intended to assist\r\nin its accomplishment.  This correctly reflects applicable law. \r\nSee United States v. Oliver, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"699623\"><a href=\"/opinion/699623/united-states-v-donovan-dwayne-oliver-darryl-lee-mcmillan-nathaniel-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 551 (9th Cir. 1995),\r\nrev'd on other grounds sub nom.

For one thing, the\r\ninstructions on that count did not make provision for aider/abettor\r\nliability, and, therefore, the verdicts were not inconsistent.  For\r\nanother thing, the two statutes differ in a material respect. \r\nSection 2119(3) discusses \"possession\" of a firearm, while section\r\n924(c) discusses \"use and carr[iage].\"  Because the definitions of\r\n\"use\" and \"carry\" under section 924(c) denote more than mere\r\npossession, a jury reasonably can find, without any logical\r\ninconsistency, that a defendant who meets the requirements of the\r\npossession element under section 2119 does not meet the more\r\nrigorous requirements imposed by section 924(c).  See Muscarello\r\nv. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118224\"><a href=\"/opinion/118224/muscarello-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Thus   although Lara disclaims\r\nsuch a theorem   we are left with the decided impression that a\r\nclaim of inconsistent verdicts lies at the heart of this assignment\r\nof error.  In recent times, we repeatedly have rejected such\r\nchallenges to criminal verdicts, see, e.g., United States v.\r\nCrochiere, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197656\"><a href=\"/opinion/197656/united-states-v-crochiere/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">233</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 239 (1st Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 118 S.\r\nCt. 1364 (1998); United States v.

CONCLUSION\r\nWe need go no further.  A painstaking review of this\r\namplitudinous record reveals that the appellants were convicted by\r\na properly constituted jury after a full and fair trial, free from\r\nreversible error, before a judge who exhibited extraordinary care\r\nand patience.  Their appeals are without basis in fact or in law.\r\n\nAffirmed.\n</pre>",
