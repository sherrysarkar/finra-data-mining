This case  began with a  bang.\r                    SARIS, District Judge.\r                                         \r\n\nIn the early morning hours of March 29, 1993, Gerald Chapman, the\r\n\nnight  watchman  at  Concordia   Company's  boat  yard  in  South\r\n\nDartmouth,  Massachusetts, awoke  to the  sound of  an explosion.\r\n\nThe PROWLER, a pleasure boat owned by Anthony Panek and moored at\r\n\nthe boat yard, burst into flames.  Although fire fighters arrived\r\n\nin only  a few minutes, by  the time they  extinguished the blaze\r\n\nthe  PROWLER was still afloat  but burned almost  to its gunnels.\r\n\nHowever, by morning the PROWLER had sunk beneath the briny waters\r\n\nof Apponagansett Bay, leaving an oil slick in its wake.  \r\n\n          A lawsuit ensued.  Concordia filed a complaint alleging\r\n\na single count in admiralty for  its costs of cleaning up the oil\r\n\nand hauling the  remains of the  PROWLER out of  the Bay.   Panek\r\n\ncounterclaimed for the damage done  to his boat, alleging  causes\r\n\nof action for breach  of contract, negligence, misrepresentation,\r\n\nand a violation of Chapter 93A of the Massachusetts General Laws.\r\n\nPanek  alleged  generally  that  Concordia did  not  fulfill  its\r\n\npromise  to provide adequate security  at the boat  yard and that\r\n\nthe lack  of security caused the  fire.  Panek also  alleged that\r\n\nConcordia  should  have prevented  the  PROWLER  from sinking  by\r\n\nadequately securing it to the dock while it was still afloat.\r\n\n          The case  was  tried  to the  district  court  with  an\r\n\nadvisory jury.   The district  court found for  Concordia on  its\r\n\nadmiralty  claim for  all  of its  clean  up and  hauling  costs.\r\n\nHowever, it also found for Panek on his claims that Concordia was\r\n\nnegligent and breached its contractual duty to secure the boat by\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nfailing to remove the hull of the boat from the water when it was\r\n\nstill floating.  The  Court awarded damages to  Panek for all  of\r\n\nthe  clean up and  half the hauling  costs, which  resulted in an\r\n\noffset  judgment for Concordia for half of its hauling costs.  On\r\n\nappeal, Panek argues that the district court erred by denying his\r\n\nrequest for  a jury trial  on his common  law counterclaims.   We\r\n\naffirm.\r\n\n                    I.  PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r                              I.  PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\n          Concordia's  complaint  included  a   single  admiralty\r\n\ncount, was captioned \"In Admiralty\", and stated it was within the\r\n\ncourt's admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  as set forth in Fed.\r\n\nR. Civ.  P. 9(h).   Plaintiff  made no demand  for a  jury trial.\r\n\nPanek's  pleading  containing the  Answer  and Counterclaims  was\r\n\nsimilarly  captioned  \"In  Admiralty\"  with  no  other  basis  of\r\n\njurisdiction  stated and  no  jury demand  made.   This  pleading\r\n\ncontained no  mention of Fed. R.  Civ. P. 9(h).   However, in its\r\n\nanswer  to the counterclaims, Concordia made a jury demand, which\r\n\nit  later withdrew.  Before  trial, Panek moved  to bifurcate his\r\n\ncommon law  counterclaims from the complaint to  allow the former\r\n\nto be  tried  by jury.    He mistakenly  based  his motion  on  a\r\n\nprevious request for a jury trial, which was never made, at least\r\n\nin writing.  The district court denied this motion.\r\n\n          After  the close  of  evidence at  trial, the  district\r\n\ncourt judge ruled that there was insufficient evidence to warrant\r\n\na finding on  the negligence  count and submitted  the breach  of\r\n\ncontract  and misrepresentation counts to the advisory jury.  The\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\njury returned a verdict finding that Concordia was not liable for\r\n\nmisrepresentation  but that it was liable to Panek for the breach\r\n\nof contract count in the amount of $16,000 -- the total amount of\r\n\ndamage done to the PROWLER.  The district court declined to adopt\r\n\nthe   advisory  jury's   verdict  on   the  breach   of  contract\r\n\ncounterclaim, entering its own  bench judgment on all the  claims\r\n\nas  follows: Concordia  was not  liable for  misrepresentation or\r\n\nviolating Chapter 93A;  Panek was liable for the  admiralty claim\r\n\nfor $4,560.35; and Concordia was liable for negligence and breach\r\n\nof contract  for $3,938.50 -- the  cost of the clean  up and half\r\n\nthe  hauling.   The  Court acknowledged  it  was \"reversing\"  its\r\n\nearlier determination that there was insufficient evidence on the\r\n\nnegligence claim  with respect to Concordia's  failure to prevent\r\n\nthe  PROWLER from sinking.   After offsetting  the two judgments,\r\n\nPanek was held liable for $621.85 plus statutory interest.\r\n\n                     II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW\r                               II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW\r\n\n          The primary  dispute on appeal is  whether the district\r\n\ncourt erred by failing to  submit Panek's common law claims  to a\r\n\nnon-advisory jury.  Panek argues that  he retained his right to a\r\n\njury  on  his common  law claims  under  the \"saving  to suitors\"\r\n\nclause of 28 U.S.C.   1333(1).1   We review claimed errors of law\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  The saving to suitors clause provides:\r\n\n          The  district  courts  shall   have  original\r\n          jurisdiction, exclusive of  the courts of the\r\n          States, of: (1) Any  civil case of  admiralty\r\n          or maritime jurisdiction,  saving to  suitors\r\n          in all cases all other remedies to which they\r\n          are otherwise entitled.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nde novo.

Poulos, 11 F.3d 271,\r                                                             \r\n\n278 (1st Cir.  1993); Blanchard  v. Peerless Ins.

Panek also  challenges the district\r\n\ncourt's calculation  of damages.  \"The  district court's findings\r\n\nof  fact,  however,  will  not  be  set  aside  unless  they  are\r\n\ndemonstrated  to  be  clearly  erroneous.\"   Id.  at  53  (citing\r                                                          \r\n\nWilliams, 11 F.3d at 278; Fed.

The Claimed Right to a Jury\r                           A.  The Claimed Right to a Jury\r\n\n          The  first issue  the  Court considers  is whether  the\r\n\ncounterclaimant waived any right  to a jury he may  have retained\r\n\nby designating his  counterclaim as \"In  Admiralty\" with no  jury\r\n\ndemand.\r\n\n          If this  suit had  involved only  non-admiralty claims,\r\n\nPanek would  have had a right to  a jury trial on  his common law\r\n\nclaims.   Fed. R. Civ.  P. 38(a)  provides that  \"[t]he right  of\r\n\ntrial  by  jury  as declared  by  the  Seventh  Amendment to  the\r\n\nConstitution or as given by a  statute of the United States shall\r\n\nbe preserved to the  parties inviolate.\"  Any party  can preserve\r                                                       \r\n\nits right to a jury by  making a timely demand for a  jury trial,\r\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 38(b), and once the demand is  made, both parties\r                                                                   \r\n\nmust consent before  it can be withdrawn, Fed.  R. Civ. P. 38(d),\r\n\n39(a).  See  Dell'Orfano v.  Romano, 962 F.2d  199, 202 (2d  Cir.\r                                             \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n28 U.S.C.   1333(1).\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n1992) (\"A plaintiff  is entitled  to rely on  a defendant's  jury\r\n\ndemand to preserve his own right to a jury trial....\"). \r\n\n          When  claims  which could  be  characterized  as either\r\n\nadmiralty  or common law claims  are raised in  a case, a party's\r\n\nright to a jury trial becomes more complex.   Cf. Fed. R. Civ. P.\r                                                           \r\n\n38(e) (providing  that \"[t]hese rules  shall not be  construed to\r\n\ncreate a right to trial by jury of the issues in an  admiralty or\r\n\nmaritime claim  within the  meaning of Rule  9(h)\").   Generally,\r\n\nthere  is no  constitutional right  to jury  trial for  admiralty\r\n\nclaims.  See  Fitzgerald v. United States Lines Co., 374 U.S. 16,\r                                                             \r\n\n19 (1963).  Congress has, however, created a statutory right to a\r\n\njury trial for certain admiralty claims.  See, e.g., 28 U.S.C.   \r                                                             \r\n\n1873  (1994) (Great Lakes Act); 46 U.S.C.App.   688 (1988) (Jones\r\n\nAct).   In addition, the  Supreme Court has  held that plaintiffs\r\n\nwho  assert both  a Jones  Act claim,  which creates  a statutory\r\n\nright  to a jury trial on the law  side of the court, and closely\r\n\nrelated admiralty claims for unseaworthiness  and maintenance and\r\n\ncure are  entitled to  a  jury trial  on  both kinds  of  claims.\r                                                        \r\n\nFitzgerald, 374 U.S. at 21 (holding  that \"only one trier of fact\r                    \r\n\nshould be  used for the trial of  what is essentially one lawsuit\r\n\nto  settle  one  claim  split conceptually  into  separate  parts\r\n\nbecause  of  historical  developments\"); see  also  Charles  Alan\r                                                            \r\n\nWright &amp; Arthur  R. Miller,  9 Federal Practice  and Procedure   \r                                                                        \r\n\n2315 (1995). \r\n\n          When a claim  sounds both  in admiralty  and in  common\r\n\nlaw,  a plaintiff can preserve  his right to  a jury by following\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\ncertain  procedures.    Pursuant  to  the  so-called  \"saving  to\r\n\nsuitors\" clause, 28 U.S.C.   1333(1), the federal district courts\r\n\nhave  \"original  jurisdiction, exclusive  of  the  courts of  the\r\n\nstates,\" over admiralty  and maritime cases, saving to suitors in\r\n\nall  cases  all  other  remedies  to  which  they  are  otherwise\r\n\nentitled.   Lewis v. United  States, 812 F. Supp.  620, 626 (E.D.\r                                             \r\n\nVa.  1993).    Interpreting the  \"saving  to  suitors\" clause  to\r\n\nreserve to  plaintiffs the right to  a common law remedy  \"in all\r\n\ncases where the common law is competent to give it,\"  the Supreme\r\n\nCourt held that  \"the common law is as competent as the admiralty\r\n\nto  give a  remedy in  all cases  where the  suit is  in personam\r\n\nagainst the owner of  the property.\"   Leon v. Galceron, 78  U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\n(11 Wall.) 185, 191  (1870).  This statute permits  plaintiffs to\r\n\nretain a right  to a  jury for \"saving-clause  claims\"2 --  those\r\n\nadmiralty claims  that could have  also been tried  to a jury  at\r\n\ncommon law  -- by either bringing  suit in state court  or in the\r\n\ngeneral jurisdiction of federal court.  See generally Odeco Oil &amp;\r                                                                           \r\n\nGas Co., Drilling  Division v.

Consequently, a plaintiff's saving-clause\r\n\ndecision determines whether the judge or a jury will act as fact-\r\n\nfinder for saving-clause claims.  \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2   See Barbara  Bennett Woodhouse,  Comment, Powell  v.

Specifically,  Panek  seeks  to\r\n\nreinstate  the jury award of  $16,000 to reflect  the evidence in\r\n\nthe record that the tuna tower (worth $10,000) and the navigation\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n4  Because we decide  the case on this ground we need not address\r\nConcordia's  further argument that  the district court's judgment\r\nshould be affirmed because  there was insufficient evidence under\r\neither a breach  of contract  or negligence theory  to find  that\r\nConcordia's breach of duty caused the fire.\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\nand  fishing  equipment  (worth  $6,000) were  destroyed  in  the\r\n\nexplosion.   However,  the  district court  found that  Concordia\r\n\nbreached its duty to  Panek only after the fire  was extinguished\r\n\nand after this property was burned.  The district court carefully\r\n\nassessed the damages proximately  caused by Concordia's breach of\r\n\nduty by failing to take reasonable  care of the hull while it was\r\n\nstill afloat and by permitting the PROWLER to sink.  The district\r\n\ncourt's factual  determinations of  damage are reviewed  only for\r\n\nclear error, see Windsor  Mount Joy Mut. Ins. Co.  v. Giragosian,\r                                                                          \r\n\n57 F.3d 50,  53 (1st Cir. 1995), and Panek does not come close to\r\n\nmeeting this standard.   We hold that the district court  did not\r\n\nclearly err in its damages findings.\r\n\n          AFFIRMED.\r                    AFFIRMED.\r                            \r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n",

In the early morning hours of March 29, 1993, Gerald Chapman, the night watchman at Concordia Company's boat yard in South Dartmouth, Massachusetts, awoke to the sound of an explosion.  The PROWLER, a pleasure boat owned by Anthony Panek and moored at the boat yard, burst into flames.  Although fire fighters arrived in only a few minutes, by the time they extinguished the blaze the PROWLER was still afloat but burned almost to its gunnels.  However, by morning the PROWLER had sunk beneath the briny waters of Apponagansett Bay, leaving an oil slick in its wake.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A lawsuit ensued.  Concordia filed a complaint alleging a single count in admiralty for its costs of cleaning up the oil and hauling the remains of the PROWLER out of the Bay.  Panek counterclaimed for the damage done to his boat, alleging causes of action for breach of contract, negligence, misrepresentation, and a violation of Chapter 93A of the Massachusetts General Laws.  Panek alleged generally that Concordia did not fulfill its promise to provide adequate security at the boat yard and that the lack of security caused the fire.  Panek also alleged that Concordia should have prevented the PROWLER from sinking by adequately securing it to the dock while it was still afloat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was tried to the district court with an advisory jury.  The district court found for Concordia on its admiralty claim for all of its clean up and hauling costs.  However, it also found for Panek on his claims that Concordia was negligent and breached its contractual duty to secure the boat by failing to remove the hull of the boat from the water when it was still floating.  The Court awarded damages to Panek for all of the clean up and half the hauling costs, which resulted in an offset judgment for Concordia for half of its hauling costs.  On appeal, Panek argues that the district court erred by denying his request for a jury trial on his common law counterclaims.  We affirm.I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Concordia's complaint included a single admiralty count, was captioned \"In Admiralty\", and stated it was within the court's admiralty and maritime jurisdiction as set forth in Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(h).  Plaintiff made no demand for a jury trial.  Panek's pleading containing the Answer and Counterclaims was similarly captioned \"In Admiralty\" with no other basis of jurisdiction stated and no jury demand made.  This pleading contained no mention of Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(h).  However, in its answer to the counterclaims, Concordia made a jury demand, which it later withdrew.  Before trial, Panek moved to bifurcate his common law counterclaims from the complaint to allow the former to be tried by jury.  He mistakenly based his motion on a previous request for a jury trial, which was never made, at least in writing.  The district court denied this motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the close of evidence at trial, the district court judge ruled that there was insufficient evidence to warrant a finding on the negligence count and submitted the breach of contract and misrepresentation counts to the advisory jury.  The jury returned a verdict finding that Concordia was not liable for misrepresentation but that it was liable to Panek for the breach of contract count in the amount of $16,000--the total amount of damage done to the PROWLER.  The district court declined to adopt the advisory jury's verdict on the breach of contract counterclaim, entering its own bench judgment on all the claims as follows:  Concordia was not liable for misrepresentation or violating Chapter 93A;  Panek was liable for the admiralty claim for $4,560.35;  and Concordia was liable for negligence and breach of contract for $3,938.50--the cost of the clean up and half the hauling.  The Court acknowledged it was \"reversing\" its earlier determination that there was insufficient evidence on the negligence claim with respect to Concordia's failure to prevent the PROWLER from sinking.  After offsetting the two judgments, Panek was held liable for $621.85 plus statutory interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The primary dispute on appeal is whether the district court erred by failing to submit Panek's common law claims to a non-advisory jury.  Panek argues that he retained his right to a jury on his common law claims under the \"saving to suitors\" clause of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1333(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  We review claimed errors of law de novo.  Windsor Mount Joy Mut. Ins. Co. v. Giragosian, 57 F.3d 50, 53 (1st Cir.1995) (citing Williams v. Poulos, 11 F.3d 271, 278 (1st Cir.1993);  Blanchard v. Peerless Ins. Co., 958 F.2d 483, 487 (1st Cir.1992)).  Panek also challenges the district court's calculation of damages.  \"The district court's findings of fact, however, will not be set aside unless they are demonstrated to be clearly erroneous.\"  Id. at 53 (citing Williams, 11 F.3d at 278;  Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. The Claimed Right to a Jury</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first issue the Court considers is whether the counterclaimant waived any right to a jury he may have retained by designating his counterclaim as \"In Admiralty\" with no jury demand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If this suit had involved only non-admiralty claims, Panek would have had a right to a jury trial on his common law claims.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 38(a) provides that \"[t]he right of trial by jury as declared by the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution or as given by a statute of the United States shall be preserved to the parties inviolate.\"   Any party can preserve its right to a jury by making a timely demand for a jury trial, Fed.R.Civ.P. 38(b), and once the demand is made, both parties must consent before it can be withdrawn, Fed.R.Civ.P. 38(d), 39(a).  See Dell'Orfano v. Romano, 962 F.2d 199, 202 (2d Cir.1992) (\"A plaintiff is entitled to rely on a defendant's jury demand to preserve his own right to a jury trial....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When claims which could be characterized as either admiralty or common law claims are raised in a case, a party's right to a jury trial becomes more complex.  Cf. Fed.R.Civ.P. 38(e) (providing that \"[t]hese rules shall not be construed to create a right to trial by jury of the issues in an admiralty or maritime claim within the meaning of Rule 9(h)\").  Generally, there is no constitutional right to jury trial for admiralty claims.  See Fitzgerald v. United States Lines Co., 374 U.S. 16, 19, 83 S.Ct. 1646, 1649, 10 L.Ed.2d 720 (1963).  Congress has, however, created a statutory right to a jury trial for certain admiralty claims.  See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1873 (1994) (Great Lakes Act);  46 U.S.C.App. &#167; 688 (1988) (Jones Act).  In addition, the Supreme Court has held that plaintiffs who assert both a Jones Act claim, which creates a statutory right to a jury trial on the law side of the court, and closely related admiralty claims for unseaworthiness and maintenance and cure are entitled to a jury trial on both kinds of claims.  Fitzgerald, 374 U.S. at 21, 83 S.Ct. at 1650 (holding that \"only one trier of fact should be used for the trial of what is essentially one lawsuit to settle one claim split conceptually into separate parts because of historical developments\");  see also Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, 9 Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 2315 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a claim sounds both in admiralty and in common law, a plaintiff can preserve his right to a jury by following certain procedures.  Pursuant to the so-called \"saving to suitors\" clause, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1333(1), the federal district courts have \"original jurisdiction, exclusive of the courts of the states,\" over admiralty and maritime cases, saving to suitors in all cases all other remedies to which they are otherwise entitled.  Lewis v. United States, 812 F.Supp. 620, 626 (E.D.Va.1993).  Interpreting the \"saving to suitors\" clause to reserve to plaintiffs the right to a common law remedy \"in all cases where the common law is competent to give it,\" the Supreme Court held that \"the common law is as competent as the admiralty to give a remedy in all cases where the suit is in personam against the owner of the property.\"  Leon v. Galceran, 78 U.S.  (11 Wall.) 185, 191, 20 L.Ed. 74 (1870).  This statute permits plaintiffs to retain a right to a jury for \"saving-clause claims\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>--those admiralty claims that could have also been tried to a jury at common law--by either bringing suit in state court or in the general jurisdiction of federal court.  See generally Odeco Oil &amp; Gas Co., Drilling Division v. Bonnette, 74 F.3d 671, 674 (5th Cir.1996) (\"The saving to suitors clause evinces a preference for jury trials and common law remedies in the forum of the claimant's choice.\").  Consequently, a plaintiff's saving-clause decision determines whether the judge or a jury will act as fact-finder for saving-clause claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where claims are cognizable either in admiralty or in a nonmaritime ground of federal jurisdiction, Rule 9(h) sets forth the procedure by which a plaintiff indicates his choice to proceed in admiralty for a saving-clause claim in federal court.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 9 advisory committee note;  see generally Woodhouse, supra, at 79 (noting that after the unification of admiralty and civil procedure rules in 1966, the \"saving clause option to choose whether to proceed in admiralty or diversity has been retained in Rule 9(h), which permits the suitor to identify his claim as an admiralty claim in order to have admiralty procedures applied\").  Rule 9(h) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>A pleading or count setting forth a claim for relief within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction that is also within the jurisdiction of the district court on some other ground may contain a statement identifying the claim as an admiralty or maritime claim for the purposes of Rules 14(c), 38(e), and the Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty and Maritime Claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(h).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The impact of the 9(h) election is that all claims are tried by the court, rather than the jury.\"  Insurance Co. of N. Am. v. Virgilio, 574 F.Supp. 48, 50 (S.D.Cal.1983) (citing Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, 9 Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 2315 at 76 (1971);  Arkwright-Boston Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Bauer Dredging, 74 F.R.D. 461, 461 (S.D.Tex.1977)).  A waiver of the right to a jury is implicit in this election.  See Koch Fuels, Inc. v. Cargo of 13,000 Barrels of No. 2 Oil, 704 F.2d 1038, 1041 (8th Cir.1983) (\"Generally, such an election precludes a jury trial.\");  Romero v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., 515 F.2d 1249, 1252-53 (5th Cir.1975) (denying plaintiff's request for a jury trial because complaint alleged that the \"basis for jurisdiction is the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction\");  McCann v. Falgout Boat Co., 44 F.R.D. 34, 42 (S.D.Tex.1968) (\"Rule 38(e) ... preserves for admiralty and maritime cases the plaintiff's right to foreclose a demand by defendant for jury trial....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the case itself is hybrid--that is, the complaint is designated as in admiralty and a compulsory counterclaim contains saving-clause claims--as the case is here, matters become even more complicated.  See generally Billy Coe Dyer, Note, The Jury on the Quarterdeck:  The Effect of Pleading Admiralty Jurisdiction When a Proceeding Turns Hybrid, 63 Tex.  L.Rev. 533, 537 (1984) (analyzing the problem of hybrid actions).  In hybrid cases, the question arises whether the plaintiff's 9(h) designation should control the procedures for the entire case or whether the court should attempt to accommodate the counterclaimant's Seventh Amendment right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a split of authority on this issue.  Some courts have concluded that a plaintiff's Rule 9(h) election characterizes the whole action regardless of any Seventh Amendment right the counterclaimant may have had to a jury trial.  See, e.g., Virgilio, 574 F.Supp. at 51 (denying jury trial on a compulsory counterclaim filed by an insured in response to a declaratory judgment action by an insurance company);  Arkwright-Boston Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co., 74 F.R.D. at 461 (same);  Camrex Ltd. v. Camrex Reliance Paint Co., Inc., 90 F.R.D. 313, 317 (E.D.N.Y.1981) (\"The right to a jury trial in actions at common law ... provides no basis for claiming a jury trial with respect to the issues in an admiralty or maritime claim so designated (as plaintiff has done) under Rule 9(h)....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other courts have allowed a separate jury trial on the common law claims where \"both parties using different triers of fact, could prevail on their respective claims without prejudicing the other party or arriving at inconsistent results.\"  Koch Fuels, Inc., 704 F.2d at 1042 (citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 42(b));  accord Alaska Barite Co. v. Freighters Inc., 54 F.R.D. 192, 194 (N.D.Cal.1972) (admiralty claim tried to bench with separate trial for permissive counterclaim).  But see Royal Ins. Co. of Am. v. Hansen, 125 F.R.D. 5, 9 (D.Mass.1988) (denying counterclaimant's request for a jury trial because of relation between counterclaims and admiralty claim and possibility of inconsistent results).  For example, in Koch Fuels, Inc. v. Cargo of 13,000 Barrels of No. 2 Oil, the Eighth Circuit affirmed the district court's grant of a separate jury trial for the common law counterclaim and a bench trial for the plaintiff's admiralty claim.  704 F.2d at 1041-42.   The court noted that \"[a]lthough there is no constitutional right to a jury trial in admiralty cases,\" the \"trial court must, whenever possible, strive to preserve the right to a trial by jury.\"  Id. (citing Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500, 510, 79 S.Ct. 948, 956, 3 L.Ed.2d 988 (1959)).  The Eighth Circuit affirmed the district court's grant of two fact-finders because the parties' claims were easily separated, one involving wrongful conversion and the other breach of contract.  Id. at 1042.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court declines to resolve the difficult issue raised by the hybrid nature of the suit because this case can be resolved on a narrower ground.  Assuming without deciding under the Koch Fuels rationale that Concordia's designation of the action as arising in admiralty did not necessarily control the entire action, we nonetheless conclude that Panek waived his right to a jury by making a 9(h) election to proceed \"In Admiralty\" without making a demand for a jury in the counterclaim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To begin, Rule 9(h) applied to Panek's counterclaim because his claims for breach of contract and negligence were saving-clause claims that could have been brought either in the district court's supplemental jurisdiction or in admiralty.  Panek's contract with Concordia was sufficiently maritime in nature to fall within the district court's admiralty jurisdiction.  See Kossick v. United Fruit Co., 365 U.S. 731, 735, 81 S.Ct. 886, 889, 6 L.Ed.2d 56 (1961) (marine insurance contracts);  Carroll v. Protection Maritime Ins. Co., Ltd., 512 F.2d 4, 6 (1st Cir.1975) (contract between seamen and vessel owner);  T.N.T. Marine Serv., Inc. v. Weaver Shipyards &amp; Dry Docks, Inc., 702 F.2d 585, 587-88 (5th Cir.)  (contract for repairs at shipyard), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 847, 104 S.Ct. 151, 78 L.Ed.2d 141 (1983).  Panek's negligence claim that Concordia's lax security caused the fire or that its failure to prevent the PROWLER from sinking is also maritime in nature.  See Butler v. American Trawler Co., Inc., 887 F.2d 20, 21 (1st Cir.1989) (\"[T]here is admiralty jurisdiction if the tort at issue 1) occurred on navigable waters and 2) bore a significant relation to traditional maritime activities.\");  Executive Jet Aviation, Inc. v. City of Cleveland, 409 U.S. 249, 268, 93 S.Ct. 493, 504, 34 L.Ed.2d 454 (1972) (holding that for the purposes of admiralty jurisdiction, a tort occurs where the negligence \"takes effect,\" not where the negligent act occurred).  Consequently, the district court could have exercised jurisdiction over the counterclaims either under its \"supplemental jurisdiction\" pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367, or admiralty, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1333, at least with respect to the breach of contract and negligence claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having concluded that Rule 9(h) could be invoked, we next consider whether Panek in fact made the requisite 9(h) \"identifying statement\" in his counterclaim, thereby waiving his right to a jury trial.  Insurance Co. of N. Am. v. Virgilio, 574 F.Supp. 48, 51 (S.D.Cal.1983) (\"By invoking 9(h) the plaintiff may preclude a right to a jury trial which might otherwise exist.\").  We conclude that he did, although the election could have been more artfully made.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  While the preferred technique is to invoke expressly Rule 9(h), Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, 5 Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 1313 at 719 (1990), the words \"In Admiralty\" in the caption with no accompanying demand for a jury trial, were sufficient to constitute a 9(h) election for admiralty procedures.  See, e.g., Teal v. Eagle Fleet, Inc., 933 F.2d 341, 345 (5th Cir.1991) (holding that a party need not make a specific reference to Rule 9(h) to fall under admiralty jurisdiction).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One important factor in determining whether a claimant has elected to proceed in admiralty is whether he demanded a jury trial.  Lewis v. United States, 812 F.Supp. 620, 627 (E.D.Va.1993) (holding that a demand for a trial by jury \"is inconsistent with an intent to proceed in admiralty\");  cf.  Royal Ins. Co. of Am. v. Hansen, 125 F.R.D. 5, 8 (D.Mass.1988) (\"Where a claim is made in accordance with Rule 9(h), the existence of diversity as an alternative basis of jurisdiction will not entitle plaintiff to a jury trial.\");  Banks v. Hanover Steamship Corp., 43 F.R.D. 374, 376-77 (D.Md.1967) (holding that a complaint that asserts both admiralty jurisdiction and diversity jurisdiction is not an adequate 9(h) designation to trigger admiralty procedures).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Panek argues that the words \"In Admiralty\" in the caption of the counterclaim were merely a label and not an \"identifying statement.\"   However, courts have held that similar titles in the captions of complaints were sufficient to trigger the identification mechanism in Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(h).  See, e.g., Teal, 933 F.2d at 345.   Moreover, Panek's argument that his jury trial right was preserved by Concordia's subsequent jury trial demand in its answer to the counterclaim is unavailing here.  While in a nonadmiralty case any party may assert a demand for a jury trial and both parties must consent to the withdrawal of the demand, in an admiralty case, a 9(h) election for admiralty cannot be undone by the opposing party's jury demand.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(h);  Craig v.

Specifically, Panek seeks to reinstate the jury award of $16,000 to reflect the evidence in the record that the tuna tower (worth $10,000) and the navigation and fishing equipment (worth $6,000) were destroyed in the explosion.  However, the district court found that Concordia breached its duty to Panek only after the fire was extinguished and after this property was burned.  The district court carefully assessed the damages proximately caused by Concordia's breach of duty by failing to take reasonable care of the hull while it was still afloat and by permitting the PROWLER to sink.  The district court's factual determinations of damage are reviewed only for clear error, see Windsor Mount Joy Mut. Ins. Co. v. Giragosian, 57 F.3d 50, 53 (1st Cir.1995), and Panek does not come close to meeting this standard.

In the early morning hours of March 29, 1993, Gerald Chapman, the night watchman at Concordia Company's boat yard in South Dartmouth, Massachusetts, awoke to the sound of an explosion.  The PROWLER, a pleasure boat owned by Anthony Panek and moored at the boat yard, burst into flames.  Although fire fighters arrived in only a few minutes, by the time they extinguished the blaze the PROWLER was still afloat but burned almost to its gunnels.  However, by morning the PROWLER had sunk beneath the briny waters of Apponagansett Bay, leaving an oil slick in its wake.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A lawsuit ensued.  Concordia filed a complaint alleging a single count in admiralty for its costs of cleaning up the oil and hauling the remains of the PROWLER out of the Bay.  Panek counterclaimed for the damage done to his boat, alleging causes of action for breach of contract, negligence, misrepresentation, and a violation of Chapter 93A of the Massachusetts General Laws.  Panek alleged generally that Concordia did not fulfill its promise to provide adequate security at the boat yard and that the lack of security caused the fire.  Panek also alleged that Concordia should have prevented the PROWLER from sinking by adequately securing it to the dock while it was still afloat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was tried to the district court with an advisory jury.  The district court found for Concordia on its admiralty claim for all of its clean up and hauling costs.  However, it also found for Panek on his claims that Concordia was negligent and breached its contractual duty to secure the boat by failing to remove the hull of the boat from the water when it was still floating.  The Court awarded damages to Panek for all of the clean up and half the hauling costs, which resulted in an offset judgment for Concordia for half of its hauling costs.  On appeal, Panek argues that the district court erred by denying his request for a jury trial on his common law counterclaims.  We affirm.I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Concordia's complaint included a single admiralty count, was captioned \"In Admiralty\", and stated it was within the court's admiralty and maritime jurisdiction as set forth in Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(h).  Plaintiff made no demand for a jury trial.  Panek's pleading containing the Answer and Counterclaims was similarly captioned \"In Admiralty\" with no other basis of jurisdiction stated and no jury demand made.  This pleading contained no mention of Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(h).  However, in its answer to the counterclaims, Concordia made a jury demand, which it later withdrew.  Before trial, Panek moved to bifurcate his common law counterclaims from the complaint to allow the former to be tried by jury.  He mistakenly based his motion on a previous request for a jury trial, which was never made, at least in writing.  The district court denied this motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the close of evidence at trial, the district court judge ruled that there was insufficient evidence to warrant a finding on the negligence count and submitted the breach of contract and misrepresentation counts to the advisory jury.  The jury returned a verdict finding that Concordia was not liable for misrepresentation but that it was liable to Panek for the breach of contract count in the amount of $16,000--the total amount of damage done to the PROWLER.  The district court declined to adopt the advisory jury's verdict on the breach of contract counterclaim, entering its own bench judgment on all the claims as follows:  Concordia was not liable for misrepresentation or violating Chapter 93A;  Panek was liable for the admiralty claim for $4,560.35;  and Concordia was liable for negligence and breach of contract for $3,938.50--the cost of the clean up and half the hauling.  The Court acknowledged it was \"reversing\" its earlier determination that there was insufficient evidence on the negligence claim with respect to Concordia's failure to prevent the PROWLER from sinking.  After offsetting the two judgments, Panek was held liable for $621.85 plus statutory interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The primary dispute on appeal is whether the district court erred by failing to submit Panek's common law claims to a non-advisory jury.  Panek argues that he retained his right to a jury on his common law claims under the \"saving to suitors\" clause of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1333(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  We review claimed errors of law de novo.

The Claimed Right to a Jury</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first issue the Court considers is whether the counterclaimant waived any right to a jury he may have retained by designating his counterclaim as \"In Admiralty\" with no jury demand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If this suit had involved only non-admiralty claims, Panek would have had a right to a jury trial on his common law claims.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 38(a) provides that \"[t]he right of trial by jury as declared by the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution or as given by a statute of the United States shall be preserved to the parties inviolate.\"   Any party can preserve its right to a jury by making a timely demand for a jury trial, Fed.R.Civ.P. 38(b), and once the demand is made, both parties must consent before it can be withdrawn, Fed.R.Civ.P. 38(d), 39(a).  See Dell'Orfano v. Romano, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">962</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">199</span></span>, 202 (2d Cir.1992) (\"A plaintiff is entitled to rely on a defendant's jury demand to preserve his own right to a jury trial....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When claims which could be characterized as either admiralty or common law claims are raised in a case, a party's right to a jury trial becomes more complex.  Cf. Fed.R.Civ.P. 38(e) (providing that \"[t]hese rules shall not be construed to create a right to trial by jury of the issues in an admiralty or maritime claim within the meaning of Rule 9(h)\").  Generally, there is no constitutional right to jury trial for admiralty claims.  See Fitzgerald v. United States Lines Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106640\"><a href=\"/opinion/106640/fitzgerald-v-united-states-lines-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">374</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 19, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106640\"><a href=\"/opinion/106640/fitzgerald-v-united-states-lines-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">720</span></a></span> (1963).  Congress has, however, created a statutory right to a jury trial for certain admiralty claims.  See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1873 (1994) (Great Lakes Act);  46 U.S.C.App. &#167; 688 (1988) (Jones Act).  In addition, the Supreme Court has held that plaintiffs who assert both a Jones Act claim, which creates a statutory right to a jury trial on the law side of the court, and closely related admiralty claims for unseaworthiness and maintenance and cure are entitled to a jury trial on both kinds of claims.  Fitzgerald, 374 U.S. at 21, 83 S.Ct. at 1650 (holding that \"only one trier of fact should be used for the trial of what is essentially one lawsuit to settle one claim split conceptually into separate parts because of historical developments\");  see also Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, 9 Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 2315 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a claim sounds both in admiralty and in common law, a plaintiff can preserve his right to a jury by following certain procedures.  Pursuant to the so-called \"saving to suitors\" clause, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1333(1), the federal district courts have \"original jurisdiction, exclusive of the courts of the states,\" over admiralty and maritime cases, saving to suitors in all cases all other remedies to which they are otherwise entitled.  Lewis v. United States, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">812</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">620</span></span>, 626 (E.D.Va.1993).  Interpreting the \"saving to suitors\" clause to reserve to plaintiffs the right to a common law remedy \"in all cases where the common law is competent to give it,\" the Supreme Court held that \"the common law is as competent as the admiralty to give a remedy in all cases where the suit is in personam against the owner of the property.\"  Leon v. Galceran, 78 U.S.  (11 Wall.) 185, 191, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></span> (1870).  This statute permits plaintiffs to retain a right to a jury for \"saving-clause claims\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>--those admiralty claims that could have also been tried to a jury at common law--by either bringing suit in state court or in the general jurisdiction of federal court.

Id. at 1042.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court declines to resolve the difficult issue raised by the hybrid nature of the suit because this case can be resolved on a narrower ground.  Assuming without deciding under the Koch Fuels rationale that Concordia's designation of the action as arising in admiralty did not necessarily control the entire action, we nonetheless conclude that Panek waived his right to a jury by making a 9(h) election to proceed \"In Admiralty\" without making a demand for a jury in the counterclaim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To begin, Rule 9(h) applied to Panek's counterclaim because his claims for breach of contract and negligence were saving-clause claims that could have been brought either in the district court's supplemental jurisdiction or in admiralty.  Panek's contract with Concordia was sufficiently maritime in nature to fall within the district court's admiralty jurisdiction.  See Kossick v.

Miller, 5 Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 1313 at 719 (1990), the words \"In Admiralty\" in the caption with no accompanying demand for a jury trial, were sufficient to constitute a 9(h) election for admiralty procedures.

See, e.g., Teal, 933 F.2d at 345.   Moreover, Panek's argument that his jury trial right was preserved by Concordia's subsequent jury trial demand in its answer to the counterclaim is unavailing here.  While in a nonadmiralty case any party may assert a demand for a jury trial and both parties must consent to the withdrawal of the demand, in an admiralty case, a 9(h) election for admiralty cannot be undone by the opposing party's jury demand.

Specifically, Panek seeks to reinstate the jury award of $16,000 to reflect the evidence in the record that the tuna tower (worth $10,000) and the navigation and fishing equipment (worth $6,000) were destroyed in the explosion.  However, the district court found that Concordia breached its duty to Panek only after the fire was extinguished and after this property was burned.  The district court carefully assessed the damages proximately caused by Concordia's breach of duty by failing to take reasonable care of the hull while it was still afloat and by permitting the PROWLER to sink.  The district court's factual determinations of damage are reviewed only for clear error, see Windsor Mount Joy Mut. Ins. Co. v. Giragosian, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196149\"><a href=\"/opinion/196149/windsor-v-giragosian/\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 53 (1st Cir.1995), and Panek does not come close to meeting this standard.
