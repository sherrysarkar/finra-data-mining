Upon careful consideration of the\r                                \r\n\narguments, the briefs and the record, we affirm the judgment\r\n\nof the district court for essentially the reasons set out in\r\n\nthe district court's opinion.\r\n\n          Appellants argue that the district court erred by\r\n\nrefusing to impose a constructive trust based on the theory\r\n\nof unjust enrichment.  They also insist that Joseph D. Ford,\r\n\nJr.'s wife, Deborah, has presented proof of her own equitable\r\n\nownership of the contested premises sufficient to undercut\r\n\nthe legal effect of her husband's individual quitclaim\r\n\nconveyance.  The lower court, however, grasped the\r\n\nappellants' basic contentions and ruled correctly as to each. \r\n\nWe see no viable theory under which Joseph D. Ford, Jr. and\r\n\nDeborah Ford can successfully claim an equitable interest in\r\n\nthe property, however labeled, especially against CME, a\r\n\ncreditor of Joseph D. Ford, Sr. and a mortgagee that was not\r\n\nprivy to any alleged private understandings between the\r\n\njunior and senior Fords.\r\n\n          Joseph D. Ford, Jr. deeded the property back to his\r\n\nfather as part of a comprehensive settlement by quitclaim\r\n\ndeed which, under Massachusetts law, conveys all right, title\r\n\nand interest in property.  Fales v. Glass, 9 Mass. App. Ct.\r                                                     \r\n\n570, 573-74, 402 N.E. 2d 1100, 1102-03 (1980).  Nothing in\r\n\nthe Stipulation Agreement, including the Fords' general\r\n\nreservation of rights, gave Joseph D. Ford, Jr. a right to\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nrepudiate the deed which it authorized him to record.  Had\r\n\nFord, Jr. wished  to preserve a right to pursue his present\r\n\nclaims, he should have made express provision to do so\r\n\ninstead of deeding all his interest back to his father. \r\n\nThere is, moreover, as the district court stated,\r\n\ninsufficient evidence to support Deborah Ford's claim that\r\n\nshe acquired an equitable interest in the property such as\r\n\nwould permit her to repudiate her husband's quitclaim deed\r\n\nand overturn CME's mortgage interest.  Her marriage to Ford,\r\n\nby itself, did not suffice.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
