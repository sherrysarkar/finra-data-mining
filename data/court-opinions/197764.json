The\r\n\nrelevant guideline provision  (application note 5 to    2L1.1\r\n\nof the  1995 Guidelines  Manual) satisfies  step  one of  the\r\n\nDiaz-Villafane analysis  by specifically  providing that  the\r                          \r\n\ncircumstances relied upon by the district court are of a kind\r\n\nthat may appropriately  be relied upon to  justify departure.\r\n\nSee United States  v.
