BRAYMAN, KERRIE BRAYMAN,\n        Individually and as PPA for JONATHAN BRAYMAN,\n JACQUELINE BRAYMAN, LAWRENCE BRAYMAN, and MADELINE BRAYMAN,\n\n                     Plaintiffs, Appellees,\n\n                               v.\n\n                         99 WEST, INC.,\n\n                     Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n               FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n       [Hon. Marianne B. Bowler, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n              Torruella and Selya, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     James L. Frederick with whom Frederick & Associates was on\nbrief for appellant.\n     Robert C. Zaffrann with whom Robert V. Costello and\nSchneider Reilly LLP were on brief for appellees.\n\f                         January 10, 2002\n\n\n\n\n          Per Curiam.    This is an appeal from a jury verdict\n\nawarding the plaintiff, Dr. Kenneth Brayman, $25,000 in damages\n\nfor an injury to his throat sustained when he began to swallow\n\nand was injured by a piece of glass in food served to him at 99\n\nWest's restaurant.    99 West raises two issues on appeal, both of\n\nwhich require little discussion.\n\n          99 West first claims that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion by allowing Dr. Brayman to give expert testimony (on\n\nhis own behalf) opining that the throat injury he sustained at\n\nthe restaurant later caused deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and a\n\npulmonary embolism.     This claim of error is moot because the\n\njury's   special   verdict   specifically   rejected   Dr.   Brayman's\n\ntestimony as to causation of the DVT and embolism and awarded no\n\ndamages for those injuries.     Since the jury ruled in favor of 99\n\nWest on that claim, the challenged expert testimony had no\n\nadverse effect and the suggestion that it prejudiced 99 West is\n\nwithout foundation.\n\n          99 West next alleges that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying 99 West's motion for a remittitur on the\n\nground that the $25,000 damage award was excessive.          The denial\n\n                                 -2-\n\fwas not error.    The piece of glass caused Dr. Brayman to suffer\n\na laceration to his soft palate and puncture wound in his\n\ntonsil.   Dr. Brayman testified to the pain and suffering caused\n\nby this injury.    Furthermore, his pain and suffering were not\n\nlimited to the time of the initial injury; the wound became\n\ninfected and caused continuing pain nearly two months later.   In\n\nfact, a CT scan taken seven weeks after the incident still\n\nshowed that pieces of glass were embedded in Brayman's tonsillar\n\nregion.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -3-\n\f",
