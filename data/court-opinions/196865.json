See 26 U.S.C.   1211.  During the 1980s, Milo\r                               \r\n\nPike (\"Taxpayer\")  made substantial  purchases of stock  in a\r\n\nnumber of New  England banks  with the intent  of creating  a\r\n\nregional bank holding company, whose stock he could sell at a\r\n\nprofit.   Before  realizing  this goal,  however, the  shares\r\n\nuniversally declined in value and, in 1989, he sold them at a\r\n\nsubstantial loss.  He classified the loss as \"capital\" on his\r\n\n1989 federal  tax return, which precluded  deduction in full.\r\n\nSee id.  In  this action to recover taxes  overpaid, Taxpayer\r                  \r\n\nclaims  his  special  scheme   and  purpose  for  making  the\r\n\npurchases   requires   that  the   stock  be   classified  as\r\n\n\"inventory,\"  a non-capital asset  under 26 U.S.C.   1221(1),\r\n\nentitling  him to full  deduction.  The  Commissioner did not\r\n\nagree.  Nor did  the district court.   Taxpayer appeals.   We\r\n\naffirm.\r\n\n          Under    1221  of  the Revenue  Code  all  taxpayer\r\n\nproperty not qualifying for  a specific exception, whether or\r\n\nnot held in connection with the taxpayer's trade or business,\r\n\nis deemed capital.  Five \"exclusive\" categories are excepted,\r\n\nArkansas  Best Corp.  v. Commissioner,  485 U.S.  212, 217-18\r                                                 \r\n\n(1988), including\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n          (1)   Stock in  trade of the  taxpayer or\r\n          other  property  of  a kind  which  would\r\n          properly be included in the  inventory of\r\n          the taxpayer  if on hand at  the close of\r\n          the taxable year, or property held by the\r\n          taxpayer primarily for sale  to customers\r\n          in  the ordinary  course of his  trade or\r\n          business.\r\n\n26 U.S.C.   1221(1).  Taxpayer does not contend that the bank\r\n\nshares  were \"stock in trade,\"  nor that he  was holding them\r\n\nfor sale to customers in the ordinary course of his business,\r\n\nnor that  they can be  exempted under  any of the  other four\r\n\nprovisions of   1221.  He does not even claim that  the stock\r\n\nwas \"inventory\"  in the usual  sense.  He  nonetheless claims\r\n\nthat  summary  judgment  was  improper because  there  remain\r\n\nunresolved  issues of material  fact as to  whether the stock\r\n\nwas  sufficiently \"inventory-like\"  to qualify  for exemption\r\n\nfrom capital asset  status under the  above-quoted exception,\r\n\nbased on his intent in acquiring it.  We disagree.\r\n\n          In  determining  whether  property   qualifies  for\r\n\nexclusion from capital asset treatment, the Supreme Court has\r\n\nindicated that a taxpayer's business purpose is relevant only\r                                                                         \r\n\nin  the very  narrow circumstance  wherein an  otherwise non-\r\n\ninventory asset may be regarded as a substitute for inventory\r                                                           \r\n\n-- i.e., property acquired  in a \"hedging  transaction[] that\r\n\n[was]  an  integral  part of  a  business' inventory-purchase\r\n\nsystem.\"    Arkansas Best,  485  U.S.  at 221-22  (explicitly\r                                     \r\n\nnarrowing  Corn Products  Refining Co.  v.

In Arkansas Best,  the Court ruled that stock in a\r                                       \r\n\nlocal bank  acquired  for  the  business-related  purpose  of\r\n\npreserving the taxpayer's financial  reputation, id. at  215,\r                                                                \r\n\nfell \"outside the classes  of property excluded from capital-\r\n\nasset status\" under    1221, thus the  loss arising from  its\r\n\nsale was \"a  capital loss.\"   Id. at  223.  Here,  Taxpayer's\r                                             \r\n\nproject  was to  purchase enough  shares of stock  in certain\r\n\nbanks sufficient to obtain the ability to persuade management\r\n\nto join in his  plan of forming the overall  holding company,\r\n\nwhose stock he would then sell.  He claims the bank stock was\r\n\nthe \"raw material\"  in his business  of building the  holding\r\n\ncompany and, as such, qualifies for the inventory exception.\r\n\n          Overall, Taxpayer was  simply seeking capital gains\r\n\nby   an  intermediate  step   --  acquiring   enough  capital\r\n\ninvestments,  that,  jointly,  might  be  converted  into new\r\n\nassets.   His scheme was manifestly not a \"hedge\" integral to\r\n\nprotecting inventory or an  inventory-purchase system.   That\r\n\nit involved work on his part and was necessary to his overall\r\n\nbusiness  plan does not change the basic picture.  His theory\r\n\nthat  the  building  blocks  of his  would-be  empire  should\r\n\nqualify as  \"inventory\"  would allow  aspiring  entrepreneurs\r\n\nsignificant influence over whether losses receive capital  or\r\n\nordinary treatment.

Taxpayer does not contend that the bank shares were \"stock in trade,\" nor that he was holding them for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his business, nor that they can be exempted under any of the other four provisions of &#167; 1221.   He does not even claim that the stock was \"inventory\" in the usual sense.   He nonetheless claims that summary judgment was improper because there remain unresolved issues of material fact as to whether the stock was sufficiently \"inventory-like\" to qualify for exemption from capital asset status under the above-quoted exception, based on his intent in acquiring it.   We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining whether property qualifies for exclusion from capital asset treatment, the Supreme Court has indicated that a taxpayer's business purpose is relevant only in the very narrow circumstance wherein an otherwise non-inventory asset may be regarded as a substitute for inventory--i.e., property acquired in a \"hedging transaction[ ] that [was] an integral part of a business' inventory-purchase system.\"  Arkansas Best, 485 U.S. at 221-22, 108 S.Ct. at 977 (explicitly narrowing Corn Products Refining Co. v. Commissioner, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">350</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></span>, 52-53, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></span>, 24-25, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></span> (1955)).   Even then there must be some objectively demonstrable nexus to an \"inventory-purchase system,\" beyond the taxpayer's subjective intent.  Id. at 221, 222, 108 S.Ct. at 976, 977.   In Arkansas Best, the Court ruled that stock in a local bank acquired for the business-related purpose of preserving the taxpayer's financial reputation, id. at 215, 108 S.Ct. at 973, fell \"outside the classes of property excluded from capital-asset status\" under &#167; 1221, thus the loss arising from its sale was \"a capital loss.\"  Id. at 223, 108 S.Ct. at 978.   Here, Taxpayer's project was to purchase enough shares of stock in certain banks sufficient to obtain the ability to persuade management to join in his plan of forming the overall holding company, whose stock he would then sell.   He claims the bank stock was the \"raw material\" in his business of building the holding company and, as such, qualifies for the inventory exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Overall, Taxpayer was simply seeking capital gains by an intermediate step--acquiring enough capital investments, that, jointly, might be converted into new assets.   His scheme was manifestly not a \"hedge\" integral to protecting inventory or an inventory-purchase system.   That it involved work on his part and was necessary to his overall business plan does not change the basic picture.   His theory that the building blocks of his would-be empire should qualify as \"inventory\" would allow aspiring entrepreneurs significant influence over whether losses receive capital or ordinary treatment.  Id. at 222, 108 S.Ct. at 977.   An ordinary investor in capital stock, objectively not entitled to take losses not offset by gains, could do so if he could show a business-related motive to realize gains through conversion and disposition of those assets.   Such an alluring door for escaping taxpayers was firmly locked in Arkansas Best.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
