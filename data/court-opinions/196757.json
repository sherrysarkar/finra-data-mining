We have carefully reviewed defendant's\r                                \r\r\n\nappellate arguments, and, finding no merit in them, we affirm\r\n\nthe sentence imposed by the district court.\r\n\n          Contrary   to   defendant's  first   argument,  the\r\n\nsentence enhancement appears entirely proper.  The procedural\r\n\nrequirements of 21 U.S.C.   851 were satisfied, and defendant\r\n\ndid nothing to dispute the existence or validity of his prior\r\n\nfelony  drug   conviction.    Although  the   district  court\r\n\nexpressed some  initial  uncertainty about  the  government's\r\n\nmotion  for  enhancement,  the  court plainly  was  aware  of\r\n\ndefendant's criminal history and sentenced him accordingly.  \r\n\n          Neither the law  nor the facts  support defendant's\r\n\nother argument  that the government should  have accepted his\r\n\noffer of assistance  and that his  sentence should have  been\r\n\nreduced.    Nothing  in   the  plea  agreement  required  the\r\n\ngovernment to  accept defendant's  offer of assistance  or to\r\n\nfile a  motion  recommending downward  departure.    Further,\r\n\ndefendant made  no  substantial allegation  of  prosecutorial\r\n\nmisconduct here,  but only suggested that  the government was\r\n\nnot interested in  his offer.   In  these circumstances,  the\r\n\nsentencing  court had no authority to grant a departure or to\r\n\nreview the government's decision  not to file a motion.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nWade v. United States, 504 U.S. 181, 185 (1992).  \r                                 \r\n\n          Affirmed.
