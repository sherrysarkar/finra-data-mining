Defendant-appellant Juan Moises Perez-\r                                \r\n\nMendez (\"Perez\")  was indicted in the  United States District\r\n\nCourt for the  District of Rhode Island  for unlawful reentry\r\n\ninto the United States following deportation, in violation of\r\n\n8  U.S.C.    1326.   Perez moved  to dismiss  the indictment,\r\n\ncollaterally attacking the validity  of the deportation order\r\n\nupon which the indictment was based.  After a hearing on  the\r\n\nmotion  to dismiss,  the  district court  denied the  motion.\r\n\nPerez  entered  an  unconditional  guilty  plea,  failing  to\r\n\nreserve  the right to appeal from the denial of his motion to\r\n\ndismiss the indictment.   He  was sentenced to  46 months  in\r\n\nprison.  He appeals from the denial of his  motion to dismiss\r\n\nthe indictment and from the sentence.  We affirm.\r\n\n     A. Motion to Dismiss Indictment\r                                                \r\n\n     Perez seeks  to appeal from the  district court's denial\r\n\nof his motion to dismiss the indictment.  He failed, however,\r\n\nto preserve that issue for  appellate review when he  entered\r\n\nhis  unconditional guilty plea.  Rule 11 of the Federal Rules\r\n\nof  Criminal   Procedure  sets  forth  the  requirements  for\r\n\nreserving such issues for appeal:\r\n\n     With the approval  of the court and  the consent of\r\n     the government, a defendant may enter a conditional\r\n     plea  of  guilty or  nolo contendere,  reserving in\r\n     writing the right, on  appeal from the judgment, to\r\n     review   of  the   adverse  determination   of  any\r\n     specified pretrial motion.\r\n\nFed.  R. Crim.  P. 11(a)(2).   Having  failed to  comply with\r\n\nthose requirements, Perez is precluded  from obtaining review\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nof the district court's  denial of his motion to  dismiss the\r\n\nindictment.\r\n\n     This court has held  \"with monotonous regularity that an\r\n\nunconditional guilty plea effectuates a waiver of any and all\r\n\nindependent  non-jurisdictional lapses  that may  have marred\r\n\nthe  case's progress up to that  point, thereby absolving any\r\n\nerrors in  the trial  court's antecedent rulings  (other than\r\n\nerrors  that  implicate  the  court's  jurisdiction).\" United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Cordero, 42 F.3d  697, 699 (1st Cir. 1994).   There\r                             \r\n\nis  an exception  to  this rule  for  errors that  call  into\r\n\nquestion the  district court's  jurisdiction  over the  case.\r\n\nSee Blackledge v.  Perry, 417 U.S. 21,  30-31 (1974) (holding\r                                    \r\n\nthat  guilty plea  did not  foreclose habeas  petitioner from\r\n\nattacking his  conviction in  Superior Court where  \"the very\r\n\ninitiation  of the  proceedings against  him in  the Superior\r\n\nCourt . . . operated to deny him due process of law.\"); Menna\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. New York, 423  U.S. 61, 62-63 (1975) (holding  that guilty\r                       \r\n\nplea  does not waive double jeopardy claim that the state was\r\n\nprecluded  from hailing him into court on the charge to which\r\n\nhe had pleaded guilty).\r\n\n     In this case, Perez does not argue that merely by haling\r\n\nhim into court  on the illegal  reentry charge, the  district\r\n\ncourt violated his due process  rights.  Instead, he contends\r\n\nthat  the underlying  deportation  hearing violated  the  due\r\n\nprocess clause  and that,  therefore, a necessary  element of\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nthe charge against him cannot be satisfied.  In United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Mendoza-Lopez, 481 U.S. 828, 839 (1987), the Supreme Court\r                            \r\n\nestablished  the   right  of  a   defendant  to  collaterally\r\n\nchallenge the  use of a deportation proceeding  as an element\r\n\nof  a criminal  offense  \"where  the  deportation  proceeding\r\n\neffectively  eliminates  the right  of  the  alien to  obtain\r\n\njudicial review.\"  Id.   By entering an  unconditional guilty\r                                  \r\n\nplea, however, Perez waived the right to challenge the use of\r\n\nthe deportation proceeding as an element of the   1326 charge\r\n\nto which he pleaded guilty.\r\n\n     In  United States v. Broce, 488 U.S. 563, 569-70 (1989),\r                                           \r\n\nthe  Supreme Court clarified that \"[a] plea of guilty and the\r\n\nensuing conviction  comprehend all  of the factual  and legal\r\n\nelements necessary  to sustain  a binding, final  judgment of\r\n\nguilt and  a lawful sentence.  . . .  A guilty plea  'is more\r\n\nthan  a confession which admits  that the accused did various\r\n\nacts.'    It is  an 'admission  that  he committed  the crime\r\n\ncharged  against  him.'\"  (Citations  omitted.)    Therefore,\r\n\nPerez' guilty plea to the charge of illegal reentry following\r\n\ndeportation included  an admission  to the  prior deportation\r\n\nelement  of  the crime.   Perez'  waiver  need not  have been\r\n\nconscious to bar his collateral challenge to the deportation.\r\n\n\"Waiver  in  that  sense  is   not  required.\"  Id.  at  573.\r                                                               \r\n\nAccordingly, Perez  has waived his  right to appeal  from the\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\ndistrict  court's  denial  of   his  motion  to  dismiss  the\r\n\nindictment. 1\r\n\n     B. Sentencing\r                              \r\n\n     Perez attempts to challenge the district court's failure\r\n\nto  grant  him  a   downward  departure  from  the  guideline\r\n\nsentencing   range  under   the   United  States   Sentencing\r\n\nGuidelines.   As this court  has often held,  \"no appeal lies\r\n\nfrom  a discretionary  refusal to  depart.\" United  States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nMorrison,  46  F.3d  127, 130  (1st  Cir.  1995).   There  is\r                    \r\n\nappellate jurisdiction,  however, \"where the  decision not to\r\n\ndepart is based  on the sentencing court's assessment  of its\r\n\nlack  of authority or power to  depart.\" Id.   The statements\r                                                        \r\n\nby the  court during Perez' sentencing  clearly \"reflect[] no\r\n\nmisapprehension on the part  of the district court as  to its\r\n\ndeparture power, but simply its decision not to exercise that\r\n\npower in the present case.\"  Id. at 132.   Therefore, we lack\r                                           \r\n\njurisdiction to review the departure decision.\r\n\n     Perez' conviction  and sentence are  summarily affirmed.\r                                                                        \r\n\nSee Loc.

Were  we to  consider  the merits,  we  would uphold  the\r\ndistrict  court's  denial of  Perez'  motion  to dismiss  the\r\nindictment.\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n",

New York, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109330\"><a href=\"/opinion/109330/menna-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span>, 62-63 (1975) (holding that guilty plea does not waive double jeopardy claim that the state was precluded from hailing him into court on the charge to which he had pleaded guilty).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Perez does not argue that merely by haling him into court on the illegal reentry charge, the district court violated his due process rights.  Instead, he contends that the underlying deportation hearing violated the due process clause and that, therefore, a necessary element of the charge against him cannot be satisfied.  In United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111894\"><a href=\"/opinion/111894/united-states-v-mendoza-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">828</span></a></span>, 839 (1987), the Supreme Court established the right of a defendant to collaterally challenge the use of a deportation proceeding as an element of a criminal offense \"where the deportation proceeding effectively eliminates the right of the alien to obtain judicial review.\"  Id. By entering an unconditional guilty plea, however, Perez waived the right to challenge the use of the deportation proceeding as an element of the Sec. 1326 charge to which he pleaded guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Broce, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112177\"><a href=\"/opinion/112177/united-states-v-broce/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">563</span></a></span>, 569-70 (1989), the Supreme Court clarified that \"[a] plea of guilty and the ensuing conviction comprehend all of the factual and legal elements necessary to sustain a binding, final judgment of guilt and a lawful sentence....  A guilty plea 'is more than a confession which admits that the accused did various acts.'  It is an 'admission that he committed the crime charged against him.' \"  (Citations omitted.)  Therefore, Perez' guilty plea to the charge of illegal reentry following deportation included an admission to the prior deportation element of the crime.  Perez' waiver need not have been conscious to bar his collateral challenge to the deportation.  \"Waiver in that sense is not required.\"  Id. at 573.  Accordingly, Perez has waived his right to appeal from the district court's denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perez attempts to challenge the district court's failure to grant him a downward departure from the guideline sentencing range under the United States Sentencing Guidelines.  As this court has often held, \"no appeal lies from a discretionary refusal to depart.\"  United States v. Morrison, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195889\"><a href=\"/opinion/195889/united-states-v-morrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">127</span></a></span>, 130 (1st Cir.1995).  There is appellate jurisdiction, however, \"where the decision not to depart is based on the sentencing court's assessment of its lack of authority or power to depart.\"  Id. The statements by the court during Perez' sentencing clearly \"reflect[ ] no misapprehension on the part of the district court as to its departure power, but simply its decision not to exercise that power in the present case.\"  Id. at 132.  Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to review the departure decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perez' conviction and sentence are summarily affirmed.
