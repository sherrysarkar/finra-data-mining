Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n               Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\nHenry Cifuentes on brief pro se.\r\nGuillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Jose A. Quiles-Espinosa,\r\nWarren Vazquez and Nelson Perez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorneys,\r\non brief for appellee.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                       March 12, 1998\r\n                                        \r\n\n  Per Curiam.  After this court affirmed appellant's\r\nconviction, the district court no longer had the power to\r\nreconsider or modify appellant's sentence.   Consequently, the\r\ndistrict court properly denied appellant's \"Motion for\r\nModification of Imprisonment,\" which asked the district court\r\nto reduce appellant's sentence for acceptance of\r\nresponsibility, a reduction the district court had expressly\r\ndenied at sentencing.  If appellant's complaint is that his\r\ntrial counsel forced appellant to go to trial against his will\r\nand would not allow appellant to plead guilty, that type of\r\ncomplaint could not be considered by the district court in the\r\ncontext of appellant's \"Motion for Modification of\r\nImprisonment,\" but instead would need to be presented in a \r\n2255 petition.  As appellant did not ask the district court to\r\ntreat his motion as a  2255 petition, the district court did\r\nnot err in failing to so treat it. \r\nAffirmed.  Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
