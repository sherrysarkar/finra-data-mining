The jury  in his  Federal Employers'\r\n\nLiability  Act action  awarded him  $450,000.1   The Railroad\r\n\nappeals from the verdict  and the denial of its motion  for a\r\n\nnew trial, saying the  evidence showed neither negligence nor\r\n\nforeseeability and that  certain evidentiary rulings were  in\r\n\nerror.\r\n\n          The  Railroad  raises two  issues  of  weight.   It\r\n\nargues  it  was  unfairly  prejudiced  by  the  exclusion  of\r\n\nevidence of a  cardiac event suffered by  plaintiff two weeks\r\n\nbefore  trial.    It also  argues  that  the  court erred  in\r\n\ninstructing the  jury that,  while defendant  was responsible\r\n\nonly  for the  aggravation of  a pre-existing  condition, the\r\n\njury must find  for plaintiff  if it could  not separate  the\r\n\ninjury  caused  by  the  condition from  that  caused  by the\r\n\naccident.  These health-related  issues require us to address\r\n\nquestions  not  resolved  before now  in  this  Circuit.   We\r\n\naffirm, though with some  sympathy for the tribulations faced\r\n\nby trial counsel.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The  jury  found  the  Railroad responsible  for  90%  of\r\nStevens' injuries; Stevens responsible for 10%.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\n          The jury could  reasonably have believed the  facts\r\n\nto be as follows:\r\n\n          On a winter morning in northern Maine, February 19,\r\n\n1994, there was  a train derailment  on the main line  to the\r\n\nMillinocket Yard  of the  Railroad.   The derailment  tore up\r\n\nsome  tracks,  which  had  to  be  repaired  promptly.    The\r\n\nMillinocket Yard is  an important junction point, and the oil\r\n\ntank  cars that fuel the local industry travel along its main\r\n\nline.\r\n\n          David  Stevens,  a trackman  and  machine operator,\r\n\narrived  at the  yard around  7 a.m.  at the  request of  his\r\n\nforeman.  Stevens' job involved  heavy manual labor, and that\r\n\nmorning he helped repair  the consequences of the derailment.\r\n\nAfter  clearing away torn rail and scrap metal, Stevens and a\r\n\nco-worker,  David Ireland, were asked to  get lengths of rail\r\n\nto repair the damaged track.\r\n\n          The  rail was kept  in the X-198  railcar, known as\r\n\nthe  \"wreck  car.\"   Different  weights  of thirty-nine  foot\r\n\nlengths  of rail were piled in the  car,2 some lying on their\r\n\nsides,  some on  their bases.   The  rails were  in disarray,\r\n\npiled to a  height of about two to three  feet above the base\r\n\nof  the car.    Their  surface  was  uneven  and  there  were\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  The \"weight\" of a rail is the weight in pounds of a three\r\nfoot section.  This car had varying lengths of 100 pound, 112\r\npound,  and  115 pound  rail, each  of  which has  a somewhat\r\ndifferent shape and size.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nirregular gaps between the  pieces of rail.  In  violation of\r\n\nthe Railroad's  own  safety rules,  the  wreck car  had  been\r\n\nloaded  using  inappropriate  equipment  and  had  not   been\r\n\nblocked, thus leading to the gaps between the rails.\r\n\n          Stevens' task  was to climb  onto the rails  in the\r\n\nwreck  car and  position  the rails  so  that his  co-worker,\r\n\nIreland, operating a machine called a pettibone, could secure\r\n\nthe rail with the pettibone's tongs.   Stevens first shoveled\r\n\nsnow and ice off the portion of the wreck car where he needed\r\n\nto  work.  The two men then successfully offloaded six rails,\r\n\nwith Ireland operating the  pettibone in response to Stevens'\r\n\nhand signals.  Then  Stevens, standing atop the rails  in the\r\n\nwreck car, reached up for the tongs of the pettibone to guide\r\n\nit down to the seventh rail.  He slipped and fell.  His right\r\n\nleg, up  to his  groin, went  down a  gap in  the rails.   He\r\n\ntwisted  as he fell and felt a  sharp pain in his back.  With\r\n\ndifficulty and great pain,  he extricated himself.  Declining\r\n\nco-workers' offers to take him to the hospital and wanting to\r\n\nearn the $20 an hour overtime  pay, Stevens continued working\r\n\nfor eighteen more hours.\r\n\n          When he  went home, the  pain continued, as  it did\r\n\nwhen he returned  to work on February 25, 1994.   On February\r\n\n28, unable  to continue working  due to the pain,  he went to\r\n\nthe hospital.  He was first diagnosed with lumbar strain, but\r\n\nwhen  physical therapy  did  not improve  his condition,  his\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\northopedic  surgeon  ordered  an  MRI,   which  showed  early\r\n\ndegenerative disk  disease and  some narrowing of  the disks.\r\n\nHe  has  since been  in  physical  and occupational  therapy,\r\n\nunable  to return to his  job because his  back pain disables\r\n\nhim from physical labor.   Jobs in his area of Maine  are few\r\n\nand far between, particularly once employment requiring heavy\r\n\nmanual  labor is excluded.   Stevens, who is  married and has\r\n\nchildren, works sporadically as  an animal control officer at\r\n\nabout  $75 a  week and  earns small  sums as  the owner  of a\r\n\ndelivery truck.\r\n\n          Before Stevens' accident, the Railroad had at times\r\n\nloaded  the rails  onto transport  cars in  a regular  tiered\r\n\nfashion.   The Railroad had decided even  before the accident\r\n\nto switch to  this system for the wreck car  because it would\r\n\nbe more  efficient.  It would also  be safer because it would\r\n\nbe easier for the pettibone operator to grab the rails and so\r\n\nreduce the need  for a trackman  to climb  onto the rails  to\r\n\nguide the pettibone's tongs.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\nSufficiency of the Evidence and New Trial Motion\r                                                            \r\n\n          The Federal Employers' Liability Act was enacted in\r\n\n1908 to provide  railroad workers with  a federal remedy  for\r\n\npersonal injuries suffered  as a result of  the negligence of\r\n\ntheir employers  or fellow workers.

FELA provides that  railroad employers are\r\n\nliable for injuries to their employees \"resulting in whole or\r                                                                         \r\n\nin  part\" from  the employer's  negligence.   45 U.S.C.    51\r                    \r\n\n(emphasis added);  see also Robert,  832 F.2d at  6 (\"[U]nder\r                                              \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nFELA  negligent  employers  cannot  escape  liability  merely\r\n\nbecause other causes contribute to the injury.\").  \r\n\n          Measured against these  standards, the evidence was\r\n\nsufficient  to impose  liability.   The Railroad  argues that\r\n\nthere was no negligence  on its part causing Stevens  to slip\r\n\nand no way for  it to foresee that Stevens would  be injured.\r\n\n          Neither  the challenge  to the  sufficiency of  the\r\n\nevidence  nor the  appeal from  the denial  of the  new trial\r\n\nmotion is well taken.\r\n\n          Stevens was injured when he fell into a gap between\r\n\nthe rails created by their haphazard arrangement in the wreck\r\n\ncar.  The  disarray also  increased the number  of times  the\r\n\ntrackman had to climb atop the rails in the wreck car to help\r\n\nthe pettibone operator,  thus making it more  likely a worker\r\n\nwould fall  and slip into a gap  between the rails.  Although\r\n\nStevens had cleared away the ice and snow from the area where\r\n\nhe was working, it was certainly foreseeable  that, given the\r\n\nuncertain footing  underneath, a trackman would fall.  It was\r\n\nalso  foreseeable that on falling,  he would slip  into a gap\r\n\nand be injured  or suffer greater injuries than  he otherwise\r\n\nwould have.  Stevens  has proffered more than enough  to meet\r\n\nhis burden.\r\n\nSubsequent Remedial Measures\r                                        \r\n\n          The Railroad claims that two items of evidence -- a\r\n\npost-accident  photograph  of a  wreck  car  whose rails  are\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\narranged in a tiered fashion, and references to comments made\r\n\nat  a company safety  meeting following the  accident -- were\r\n\nadmitted into  evidence in  violation of  Fed. R.  Evid. 407,\r\n\nwhich  prohibits the introduction of a defendant's subsequent\r\n\nremedial measures.\r\n\n          We doubt that Rule 407 applies at  all here.  As to\r\n\nthe  photograph  showing a  car  with the  rails  arranged in\r\n\ntiers,3  the  jury  was  told   only  that  it  depicted   an\r\n\narrangement of the  type Stevens  had seen on  other cars  on\r\n\nwhich  he had worked before  his accident.   The jury was not\r\n\ninformed of the date of the  photograph and was not told that\r\n\nit portrayed  a subsequent remedial measure.   The photograph\r\n\nwas properly  admitted to  show the Railroad's  past practice\r\n\nand standard of care.\r\n\n          The  jury also  did  not know  that the  challenged\r\n\nreferences   to  statements  by   Mr.  Cote,  the  Railroad's\r\n\nroadmaster, concerned statements made during  a post-accident\r\n\nsafety  meeting.   The references  to Cote's  statements were\r\n\nsupported by notes  taken by one  of the Railroad's  foremen,\r\n\nThomas  Bell.4   The  jury  never  saw  the  notes,  and  the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  The photograph was a fair representation of rails aligned\r\nin a row, same sides up, which Stevens had walked on in other\r\ncars  prior to  the accident.   It  showed a  different, less\r\ndangerous alignment  than the alignment  in the wreck  car on\r\nwhich he was injured.\r\n\n4.   The notes said  that, \"Rails still coming in  from Derby\r\non supply  cars a mess rails every which way and Holes in the\r\nfloor of car . . . . RNC [Robert N. Cote] mentioned  [time of\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nreferences to Cote's statements were admitted for impeachment\r\n\npurposes only.  Cote  had testified that he had  never stated\r\n\nthe rails  on the wreck car  were in disarray at  the time of\r\n\nthe plaintiff's accident and that he remembered the rails  as\r\n\nhaving been arranged  neatly.  His later  statement about the\r\n\ncondition of the rails  at the time of the accident  could be\r\n\nunderstood to be to the contrary and was thus fair game.\r\n\n          Thus, because the evidence was not presented to the\r\n\njury   directly  or  by   inference  as  subsequent  remedial\r\n\nmeasures, Rule 407 does not apply.  Even if Rule 407 applied,\r\n\nthe exception within the rule would also apply:\r\n\n          This rule does  not require the exclusion\r\n          of evidence of  subsequent measures  when\r\n          offered  for  another  purpose,  such  as\r\n          proving     ownership,    control,     or\r\n          feasibility of precautionary measures, if\r\n          controverted, or impeachment.\r\n\nThis evidence fell  within the exception.  These  two rulings\r\n\nfell well  within the  sound discretion  of the  trial judge.\r\n\nSee Blinzler v.

Stevens was diagnosed with  a threatened\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nStevens' accident] as an example.\"\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nanterior septal myocardial  infarction5 and  was released  on\r\n\nNovember 14, 1995.  The parties agreed that the cardiac event\r\n\nwas  not caused in any way by Stevens' accident or consequent\r\n\ninjuries.\r\n\n          The Railroad  was  not permitted  to  cross-examine\r\n\nStevens  about his cardiac event or  to introduce the medical\r\n\nrecords  into  evidence.    The  Railroad  argued  that  such\r\n\nexamination  was  pertinent   to  Stevens'   life  and   work\r\n\nexpectancy.    The  court  excluded all  evidence  about  the\r\n\ncardiac event  because the Railroad failed  to proffer expert\r\n\ntestimony to link  it to life expectancy or  work expectancy.\r\n\nAbsent such testimony the court  felt that the evidence would\r\n\nhave  been speculative  and  unduly prejudicial.   The  trial\r\n\ncourt  also  excluded  the  evidence in  part  based  on  its\r\n\nunderstanding \"that any independent event  that the defendant\r\n\nis  not  responsible for  in  reference  to  his  health  and\r\n\ncondition could not be considered by [the  jury] for purposes\r\n\nof awarding damages.\"\r\n\n          This latter basis for  the trial court's ruling was\r\n\nerroneous.   If post-accident health problems  have an impact\r\n\non  a plaintiff's ability to  work or on  his life expectancy\r\n\nand  arise  independently  of  the   accident,  defendant  is\r\n\nentitled  to adduce evidence of such problems in an effort to\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.

Here, the Railroad  commendably concedes that\r\n\nin the ordinary course,   evidence of unrelated post-accident\r\n\nhealth problems without medical  testimony as to their effect\r\n\non  plaintiff's  life and  work  expectancy  would be  unduly\r\n\nspeculative.  See, e.g.,  Meller v.

(excluding evidence of  the decedent's drug\r\n\nuse in  a wrongful death action in part due to the absence of\r\n\na  medical  foundation for  the  defendant's  claim that  the\r\n\ndecedent's life expectancy would  have been diminished by his\r\n\ndrug  use), cert. denied, 467 U.S. 1206 (1984).  The Railroad\r                                    \r\n\nsays  that  it  did not  have  enough  time  to develop  such\r\n\ntestimony,   that  the   court  denied   its  motion   for  a\r\n\ncontinuance,6 and that the exclusion was therefore error.\r\n\n          Although close,  we find no abuse  of discretion in\r\n\nlight of three factors.  First,  the timing, while difficult,\r\n\nwas far from  impossible.  The Railroad acknowledges  that it\r\n\nreceived notification  of the plaintiff's myocardial event at\r\n\nleast  ten  days before  the  trial was  scheduled  to begin.\r\n\nNothing prevented the defendant from  starting to look for an\r\n\nexpert witness at that time.  The Railroad was promptly given\r\n\nthe  medical  records,  and  it  interviewed   the  attending\r\n\nphysician.  The  defendant did not begin  to put on its  case\r\n\nuntil  December  4,  effectively  giving it  over  two  weeks\r\n\n(albeit  subject  to  the Thanksgiving  holiday  weekend), to\r\n\nlocate an expert witness.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  The Railroad's request for a continuance was based on its\r\nrepresentation  that  it  needed  to  investigate  the  issue\r\nfurther.   The  court denied  the continuance  based on  that\r\nrepresentation  and directed plaintiff's  counsel to give the\r\ndefense all  the medical information  it had.   The  hospital\r\nrecords were promptly provided.  No specific request was made\r\nfor a continuance in order to locate an expert witness.\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\n          Second,  there is very little evidence establishing\r\n\nprejudice to the Railroad.  There was no offer of proof as to\r\n\nwhat  a potential  cardiologist expert  witness would  say to\r\n\nlink the cardiac event causally to the legal issues.   We are\r\n\nleft not  knowing whether  there is,  in fact,  any colorable\r\n\nclaim of linkage.   There is not even a  clear record of when\r\n\nthe  Railroad first  received  the hospital  records or  what\r\n\nsteps  it took in  response, although  at oral  argument both\r\n\ncounsel attempted to recreate the sequence from memory.\r\n\n          Third,  during the  trial,  well after  it received\r\n\nnotice of the plaintiff's cardiac event, the Railroad entered\r\n\ninto a stipulation based  on mortality tables as to  the life\r\n\nand work expectancy of  a typical man of plaintiff's  age who\r\n\nwas of average health.  The jury was instructed that it could\r\n\nconsider  the stipulation along with other  evidence.  In the\r\n\nface of the  stipulation and the absence of even a proffer to\r\n\nlink  the   cardiac  event  to  plaintiff's   life  and  work\r\n\nexpectancy, it  was hardly  an abuse  of  discretion for  the\r\n\ncourt to exclude the evidence.\r\n\nVocational Testimony\r                                \r\n\n          Similarly, we reject the challenge to the testimony\r\n\nof  plaintiff's vocational  expert.   The  Railroad says  the\r\n\ntestimony lacked adequate factual basis and complains that it\r\n\nwas sandbagged when, on cross-examination, it learned for the\r\n\nfirst  time that  the expert  had updated  her  research just\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nbefore  and  during the  trial  in violation  of  a pre-trial\r\n\nscheduling   order  (and,  although   not  mentioned  by  the\r\n\ndefendant, of  Fed. R. Civ.  P. 26(e)(1)  as well).   A trial\r\n\ncourt has wide discretion in determining the admissibility of\r\n\nexpert testimony, and we will  reverse its decision only when\r\n\nthere  has been a clear  abuse of discretion.

The expert  testified that the\r\n\ninformation she  relied upon was  the sort typically  used by\r\n\npersons  in her  field.   The Railroad  made no  proffer that\r\n\nvocational experts  rely  on different  types of  information\r\n\nthan  did plaintiff's expert.   We think  the foundation laid\r\n\nwas adequate.\r\n\n          As  to the  expert's last  minute research  and the\r\n\nlack  of notice to the  Railroad, this is  a trial management\r\n\nissue within the  trial court's discretion.   The trial judge\r\n\nrecognized that the expert adhered to the same opinions which\r\n\nhad been timely disclosed  to the Railroad.  The  court quite\r\n\nproperly  offered  to  instruct   the  jury  that  it  should\r\n\ndisregard   any   information  the   expert   acquired  after\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nsubmitting her report.   The Railroad did not take  the trial\r\n\ncourt up  on this offer and  did not ask  for additional time\r\n\nbefore continuing  cross-examination.  There was  no abuse in\r\n\nthe  ruling that  the violation  of the  pre-trial scheduling\r\n\norder did not warrant striking the expert's entire testimony.\r\n\nJury Instructions\r                             \r\n\n          The Railroad's final claim  is that the trial court\r\n\nimproperly  instructed the jury  on the issue  of damages and\r\n\nthat this  was sufficiently prejudicial, based  on the record\r\n\nas a  whole, to  warrant a  reversal  of the  judgment.   The\r\n\nquestion,  one of first  impression for this  court, is which\r\n\nside should prevail on this issue in a FELA action when there\r\n\nis adequate  expert testimony  that an accident  aggravated a\r\n\npre-existing condition7 but the jury cannot separate the pain\r\n\nor disability caused by  the pre-existing condition from that\r\n\nresulting from  the accident.   We  believe that the  balance\r\n\ntips in  favor  of compensating  the FELA  plaintiff, and  so\r\n\nuphold the jury instructions.\r\n\n          Ample evidence  was presented at trial that Stevens\r\n\nsuffered from degenerative disk disease prior to his February\r\n\n1994 accident.

This   case  does   not  involve   the  problem   of  the\r\nadmissibility  of the  expert's  testimony if  the expert  is\r\nunable to ascertain whether the trauma  of the accident would\r\nexacerbate a prior condition of this particular patient.

However,  Stevens\r\n\npresented  expert  testimony  that  the  accident  caused  an\r\n\naggravation  of his  pre-existing  condition.   His  treating\r\n\nphysician testified  that, while  \"there must have  been some\r\n\ndegenerative disk disease present\"  before the accident,  \"it\r\n\nwas  silent[,] [s]o he did  not feel anything,\"  and that the\r\n\naccident caused him to feel the condition for the first time.\r\n\nThere  was  also   evidence,  however,  that  plaintiff   had\r\n\nexperienced back pain prior to the accident.\r\n\n          The trial judge instructed the jury as follows:\r\n\n               There is evidence in this  case that\r\n          plaintiff  had  a pre-existing  injury or\r\n          condition which existed prior to February\r\n          19,  1994.  The  railroad is  only liable\r\n          for damages you find  to be caused by the\r\n          occurrence of February 19, 1994.  If  you\r\n          find   that    plaintiff's   pre-existing\r\n          condition  made  him more  susceptible to\r\n          injury than a person in  good health, the\r\n          defendant is responsible for all injuries\r\n          suffered by the plaintiff as a  result of\r\n          the defendant's negligence, even if those\r\n          injuries are greater than would have been\r\n          suffered by a person in good health under\r\n          the same circumstances.\r\n               If    you   find    that   defendant\r\n          negligently  caused   further  injury  or\r\n          aggravation  to plaintiff's  pre-existing\r\n          condition,   plaintiff  is   entitled  to\r\n          compensation   for  all   of  plaintiff's\r\n          damages caused by the incident, including\r\n          that  further injury or  aggravation.  If\r\n          you   cannot   separate   the   pain   or\r\n          disability  caused  by  the  pre-existing\r\n          condition   from   that  caused   by  the\r\n          occurrence of February 19, 1994, then the\r\n          defendant   is   liable   for    all   of\r\n          plaintiff's injuries.\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nThe defendant takes issue  with the last sentence.   However,\r\n\nthe instructions correctly stated the law.\r\n\n          It  is  true  that  as a  general  matter,  when  a\r\n\ndefendant's negligence aggravates a  plaintiff's pre-existing\r\n\nhealth  condition,  the  defendant  is liable  only  for  the\r\n\nadditional increment caused by the negligence and not for the\r\n\npain and  impairment that  the plaintiff would  have suffered\r\n\neven if the accident had never occurred.  See, e.g., Evans v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nUnited  Arab Shipping  Co.,  790 F.

Contrary to the  defendant's premise,\r\n\nthe  jury was so instructed here.  But that general statement\r\n\nof law does not  provide a complete response to  the question\r\n\nof which party prevails when the harm due to the pre-existing\r\n\ncondition is inseparable from the harm due to the accident.\r\n\n          We  turn first to  the language of  the FELA, which\r\n\ntends to  favor the plaintiff  but which is  not dispositive.\r\n\nSection 1 of  FELA states:  \"[Defendant] shall  be liable  in\r\n\ndamages  .  .  .  resulting in  whole  or  in  part  from the\r                                                               \r\n\nnegligence  of [defendant,  its agents,  or employees].\"   45\r\n\nU.S.C.   51 (emphasis added).  This language suggests, as the\r\n\njury instruction  indicated,  that once  the  plaintiff  puts\r\n\nforth credible  evidence of causation --  that the Railroad's\r\n\nnegligence has  aggravated a  pre-existing  condition --  the\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\ndefendant  will be liable for damages even if the jury cannot\r\n\nseparate the amount of  harm caused by the accident  from the\r\n\namount  of   harm  caused  by   the  pre-existing  condition.\r\n\nHowever, the  statutory language  does  not provide  explicit\r\n\ninstructions  about the appropriate  apportionment of damages\r\n\nwhen the causes of plaintiff's disability are inseparable.\r\n\n          More  helpful is  a  consideration  of the  primary\r\n\nstatutory  purpose:  \"to eliminate  a  number  of traditional\r\n\ndefenses  to tort  liability  and to  facilitate recovery  in\r\n\nmeritorious  cases.\"  Atchison T.  &amp; S.F.

Allowing a  defendant  to  escape liability\r\n\nbecause of  the jury's  inability to separate  the disability\r\n\ndue to  plaintiff's pre-existing  condition from that  due to\r\n\nthe  accident would  prevent  the  plaintiff from  recovering\r\n\ndamages  for  the  aggravation  in what  the  factfinder  has\r\n\ndetermined to be a  meritorious case.

Indeed, FELA and  other federal statutes incorporate the\r\n\"eggshell  skull\" rule  to  prevent defendant  from  avoiding\r\nliability  in certain cases.   See, e.g., Jordan v.

And the  principle that\r\nindivisible  harm  results  in  imposing  full  liability  on\r\ndefendants is  recognized in other  areas of  federal law  as\r\nwell.   See, e.g., Price v.

Thus, a defendant gets the benefit  of apportionment\r\n\nof  harm only if \"there is a reasonable basis for determining\r\n\nthe contribution  of each  cause to  a single  harm.\"  Id.   \r                                                                      \r\n\n433A(1)(b), at 434.  If not, the defendant  is liable for the\r\n\nwhole.  According to   433A,  both the defendant's negligence\r\n\nand the  plaintiff's pre-existing  condition  are deemed  the\r\n\ncause of the  entire harm,  thus imposing the  burden of  the\r\n\nwhole on both.  But  this tie is broken by  the congressional\r\n\nintent  to implement  a  policy  benefitting injured  railway\r\n\nworkers.9\r\n\n          An   additional   policy  argument   that  supports\r\n\nupholding  the   jury  instruction   may  be  found   in  the\r\n\nRestatement's discussion  of the related question  of who has\r                       \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n9.

However, the Restatement indicates that \"[s]uch\r                                                  \r\nentire  liability is  imposed where  some of  the causes  are\r\ninnocent . . . .\"  Id.   433A(2) cmt. i, at 439; cf. id. app.\r                                                                    \r\nat 140 (1966) (noting that \"as to an original injury followed\r\nby negligent treatment,\"  the treating  physician \"is  liable\r\nonly for the aggravation  he has caused\").  The  instant case\r\nis closely analogous, and the parallel between aggravation of\r\na  pre-existing condition  and  the harm  caused by  multiple\r\ntortfeasors has  been drawn  by several courts.   See,  e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\nLovely v. Allstate Ins.

In such  a case  the\r\n          defendant  may  justly  be   required  to\r\n          assume  the  burden  of   producing  that\r\n          evidence, or if  he is not able to do so,\r\n          of bearing the full responsibility.\r\n\nId.   433B(2)  cmt. d, at 444.11  The  comment concludes, \"As\r               \r\n\nbetween  the proved  tortfeasor who  has clearly  caused some\r\n\nharm, and the entirely innocent plaintiff, any hardship . . .\r\n\nshould fall upon the former.\"  Id.\r                                              \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n10.  At  trial,   defendant  asked  for  a  jury  instruction\r\nindicating that  if the  causes of plaintiff's  injuries were\r\nseparable, plaintiff had the burden of proof on the extent to\r\nwhich the accident caused the aggravation of the pre-existing\r\ncondition.   Because  this  case involves  an instruction  on\r\nindivisible injuries, we need not decide the question  of who\r\nbears  the  burden  as   to  aggravation  of  a  pre-existing\r\ncondition when the  damages are separable.   However, to  the\r\nextent that  the Railroad is contending  that plaintiff bears\r\nthe entire  burden  of proving  damages,  we note  that  this\r\nargument  is undercut  by the  statutory scheme,  which makes\r\ncomparative negligence an affirmative  defense.  But cf. Dale\r                                                                         \r\nv. Baltimore &amp;  O.

The rule placing the  burden as to apportionment  on the\r\ndefendant  has  also  been  adopted  by  at  least one  court\r\ninterpreting  a similar  federal statute.   Maurer  v. United\r                                                                         \r\nStates, 668 F.2d 98, 100 (2d Cir. 1981) (Public Vessels Act).\r                  \r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\n          The  primary policy  argument against  shifting the\r\n\nburden   of  proving  apportionment   to  defendant  is  that\r\n\nplaintiff  is in the better position to prove what portion of\r\n\nhis  injuries was caused by the accident.

P. 35,  it is not unfair to\r\n\nplace on  defendant that burden  and the consequences  of not\r\n\nmeeting it.\r\n\n          We therefore think the better rule, particularly in\r\n\nlight  of FELA's  broad  remedial purposes,  is  that if  the\r\n\nfactfinder cannot separate injuries  caused or exacerbated by\r\n\nthe  accident  from  those   resulting  from  a  pre-existing\r\n\ncondition, the defendant is liable for all such injuries.12\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n12.

The derailment tore up some tracks, which had to be repaired promptly.  The Millinocket Yard is an important junction point, and the oil tank cars that fuel the local industry travel along its main line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">David Stevens, a trackman and machine operator, arrived at the yard around 7 a.m. at the request of his foreman.  Stevens' job involved heavy manual labor, and that morning he helped repair the consequences of the derailment.  After clearing away torn rail and scrap metal, Stevens and a co-worker, David Ireland, were asked to get lengths of rail to repair the damaged track.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rail was kept in the X-198 railcar, known as the \"wreck car.\"   Different weights of thirty-nine foot lengths of rail were piled in the car,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> some lying on their sides, some on their bases.  The rails were in disarray, piled to a height of about two to three feet above the base of the car.  Their surface was uneven and there were irregular gaps between the pieces of rail.  In violation of the Railroad's own safety rules, the wreck car had been loaded using inappropriate equipment and had not been blocked, thus leading to the gaps between the rails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stevens' task was to climb onto the rails in the wreck car and position the rails so that his co-worker, Ireland, operating a machine called a pettibone, could secure the rail with the pettibone's tongs.  Stevens first shoveled snow and ice off the portion of the wreck car where he needed to work.  The two men then successfully offloaded six rails, with Ireland operating the pettibone in response to Stevens' hand signals.  Then Stevens, standing atop the rails in the wreck car, reached up for the tongs of the pettibone to guide it down to the seventh rail.  He slipped and fell.  His right leg, up to his groin, went down a gap in the rails.  He twisted as he fell and felt a sharp pain in his back.  With difficulty and great pain, he extricated himself.  Declining co-workers' offers to take him to the hospital and wanting to earn the $20 an hour overtime pay, Stevens continued working for eighteen more hours.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When he went home, the pain continued, as it did when he returned to work on February 25, 1994.  On February 28, unable to continue working due to the pain, he went to the hospital.  He was first diagnosed with lumbar strain, but when physical therapy did not improve his condition, his orthopedic surgeon ordered an MRI, which showed early degenerative disk disease and some narrowing of the disks.  He has since been in physical and occupational therapy, unable to return to his job because his back pain disables him from physical labor.  Jobs in his area of Maine are few and far between, particularly once employment requiring heavy manual labor is excluded.  Stevens, who is married and has children, works sporadically as an animal control officer at about $75 a week and earns small sums as the owner of a delivery truck.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before Stevens' accident, the Railroad had at times loaded the rails onto transport cars in a regular tiered fashion.  The Railroad had decided even before the accident to switch to this system for the wreck car because it would be more efficient.  It would also be safer because it would be easier for the pettibone operator to grab the rails and so reduce the need for a trackman to climb onto the rails to guide the pettibone's tongs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>Sufficiency of the Evidence and New Trial Motion</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Federal Employers' Liability Act was enacted in 1908 to provide railroad workers with a federal remedy for personal injuries suffered as a result of the negligence of their employers or fellow workers.  Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Gottshall, 512 U.S. 532, ----, 114 S.Ct. 2396, 2404, 129 L.Ed.2d 427 (1994);  Robert v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 832 F.2d 3, 5-6 (1st Cir.1987) (citing Atchison T. &amp; S.F. R.R. v. Buell, 480 U.S. 557, 561, 107 S.Ct. 1410, 1413, 94 L.Ed.2d 563 (1987)).  FELA is a broad remedial statute and has been liberally construed to effectuate the congressional intent of protecting railroad employees.  Id. (citing Sinkler v. Missouri Pac.  R.R., 356 U.S. 326, 330, 78 S.Ct. 758, 762, 2 L.Ed.2d 799 (1958)).  The standard for liability under FELA is low, although the statute does not impose absolute liability on employers.  Moody v. Boston &amp; Maine Corp., 921 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A FELA plaintiff must prove the traditional common law elements of negligence--duty, breach, damages, causation, and foreseeability.  Robert, 832 F.2d at 6. Specifically, he must show that his employer breached its duty to maintain a safe workplace, that he was harmed by that breach, and that the harm was foreseeable.  The employer's duty to maintain a safe workplace does not require all dangers to be eradicated, but it does demand the elimination of those that can reasonably be avoided in light of the normal requirements of the job.  Conway v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 720 F.2d 221, 223 (1st Cir.1983), cert. denied, 466 U.S. 937, 104 S.Ct. 1911, 80 L.Ed.2d 459 (1984).  FELA provides that railroad employers are liable for injuries to their employees \"resulting in whole or in part \" from the employer's negligence.  45 U.S.C. &#167; 51 (emphasis added);  see also Robert, 832 F.2d at 6 (\"[U]nder FELA negligent employers cannot escape liability merely because other causes contribute to the injury.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Measured against these standards, the evidence was sufficient to impose liability.  The Railroad argues that there was no negligence on its part causing Stevens to slip and no way for it to foresee that Stevens would be injured.  Neither the challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence nor the appeal from the denial of the new trial motion is well taken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stevens was injured when he fell into a gap between the rails created by their haphazard arrangement in the wreck car.  The disarray also increased the number of times the trackman had to climb atop the rails in the wreck car to help the pettibone operator, thus making it more likely a worker would fall and slip into a gap between the rails.  Although Stevens had cleared away the ice and snow from the area where he was working, it was certainly foreseeable that, given the uncertain footing underneath, a trackman would fall.  It was also foreseeable that on falling, he would slip into a gap and be injured or suffer greater injuries than he otherwise would have.  Stevens has proffered more than enough to meet his burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Subsequent Remedial Measures</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Railroad claims that two items of evidence--a post-accident photograph of a wreck car whose rails are arranged in a tiered fashion, and references to comments made at a company safety meeting following the accident--were admitted into evidence in violation of Fed.R.Evid. 407, which prohibits the introduction of a defendant's subsequent remedial measures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We doubt that Rule 407 applies at all here.  As to the photograph showing a car with the rails arranged in tiers,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> the jury was told only that it depicted an arrangement of the type Stevens had seen on other cars on which he had worked before his accident.  The jury was not informed of the date of the photograph and was not told that it portrayed a subsequent remedial measure.  The photograph was properly admitted to show the Railroad's past practice and standard of care.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury also did not know that the challenged references to statements by Mr. Cote, the Railroad's roadmaster, concerned statements made during a post-accident safety meeting.  The references to Cote's statements were supported by notes taken by one of the Railroad's foremen, Thomas Bell.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The jury never saw the notes, and the references to Cote's statements were admitted for impeachment purposes only.  Cote had testified that he had never stated the rails on the wreck car were in disarray at the time of the plaintiff's accident and that he remembered the rails as having been arranged neatly.  His later statement about the condition of the rails at the time of the accident could be understood to be to the contrary and was thus fair game.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, because the evidence was not presented to the jury directly or by inference as subsequent remedial measures, Rule 407 does not apply.  Even if Rule 407 applied, the exception within the rule would also apply:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>This rule does not require the exclusion of evidence of subsequent measures when offered for another purpose, such as proving ownership, control, or feasibility of precautionary measures, if controverted, or impeachment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This evidence fell within the exception.  These two rulings fell well within the sound discretion of the trial judge.  See Blinzler v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 81 F.3d 1148, 1158 (1st Cir.1996);  Roy v. Star Chopper Co., 584 F.2d 1124, 1134 (1st Cir.1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 916, 99 S.Ct. 1234, 59 L.Ed.2d 466 (1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Cardiac Event</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two weeks before trial and two and a half weeks after the jury was impanelled, Stevens was hospitalized on November 11, 1995.  Stevens was diagnosed with a threatened anterior septal myocardial infarction<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and was released on November 14, 1995.  The parties agreed that the cardiac event was not caused in any way by Stevens' accident or consequent injuries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Railroad was not permitted to cross-examine Stevens about his cardiac event or to introduce the medical records into evidence.  The Railroad argued that such examination was pertinent to Stevens' life and work expectancy.  The court excluded all evidence about the cardiac event because the Railroad failed to proffer expert testimony to link it to life expectancy or work expectancy.  Absent such testimony the court felt that the evidence would have been speculative and unduly prejudicial.  The trial court also excluded the evidence in part based on its understanding \"that any independent event that the defendant is not responsible for in reference to his health and condition could not be considered by [the jury] for purposes of awarding damages.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This latter basis for the trial court's ruling was erroneous.  If post-accident health problems have an impact on a plaintiff's ability to work or on his life expectancy and arise independently of the accident, defendant is entitled to adduce evidence of such problems in an effort to reduce a potential damages award.  In FELA cases plaintiff must prove pre-injury and post-injury earning potential.  Quinones-Pacheco v. American Airlines, 979 F.2d 1, 6-7 (1st Cir.1992).  As the Sixth Circuit held in a FELA case, Harris v. Illinois Cent. R.R., 58 F.3d 1140 (6th Cir.1995):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If [plaintiff] had died in 1992 of a heart attack unrelated to his fall at work, the period for which his estate could recover lost earnings would have been cut off at the point of death.  See Dixon v. International Harvester Co., 754 F.2d 573, 588-90 (5th Cir.1985).  If his heart condition would have rendered him incapable of working as a carman, similarly, we think it would be error to allow testimony on his potential earnings as a carman beyond the point at which his work as a carman would have had to cease even if he had never injured his leg and back.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 1144-45;  accord Agosto v. Trusswal Sys. Corp., 142 F.R.D. 118, 120 (E.D.Pa.1992);  Smith v. Southland Corp., 738 F.Supp. 923, 926 (E.D.Pa.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That does not mean the trial judge erred in excluding the evidence, particularly in light of his alternative grounds for doing so.  A decision to exclude evidence is reviewed for abuse of discretion.  Blinzler, 81 F.3d at 1158.   Here, the Railroad commendably concedes that in the ordinary course, evidence of unrelated post-accident health problems without medical testimony as to their effect on plaintiff's life and work expectancy would be unduly speculative.  See, e.g., Meller v. Heil Co., 745 F.2d 1297, 1303 (10th Cir.)  (excluding evidence of the decedent's drug use in a wrongful death action in part due to the absence of a medical foundation for the defendant's claim that the decedent's life expectancy would have been diminished by his drug use), cert. denied, 467 U.S. 1206, 104 S.Ct. 2390, 81 L.Ed.2d 347 (1984).  The Railroad says that it did not have enough time to develop such testimony, that the court denied its motion for a continuance,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and that the exclusion was therefore error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although close, we find no abuse of discretion in light of three factors.  First, the timing, while difficult, was far from impossible.  The Railroad acknowledges that it received notification of the plaintiff's myocardial event at least ten days before the trial was scheduled to begin.  Nothing prevented the defendant from starting to look for an expert witness at that time.  The Railroad was promptly given the medical records, and it interviewed the attending physician.  The defendant did not begin to put on its case until December 4, effectively giving it over two weeks (albeit subject to the Thanksgiving holiday weekend), to locate an expert witness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, there is very little evidence establishing prejudice to the Railroad.  There was no offer of proof as to what a potential cardiologist expert witness would say to link the cardiac event causally to the legal issues.  We are left not knowing whether there is, in fact, any colorable claim of linkage.  There is not even a clear record of when the Railroad first received the hospital records or what steps it took in response, although at oral argument both counsel attempted to recreate the sequence from memory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, during the trial, well after it received notice of the plaintiff's cardiac event, the Railroad entered into a stipulation based on mortality tables as to the life and work expectancy of a typical man of plaintiff's age who was of average health.  The jury was instructed that it could consider the stipulation along with other evidence.  In the face of the stipulation and the absence of even a proffer to link the cardiac event to plaintiff's life and work expectancy, it was hardly an abuse of discretion for the court to exclude the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Vocational Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, we reject the challenge to the testimony of plaintiff's vocational expert.  The Railroad says the testimony lacked adequate factual basis and complains that it was sandbagged when, on cross-examination, it learned for the first time that the expert had updated her research just before and during the trial in violation of a pre-trial scheduling order (and, although not mentioned by the defendant, of Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(e)(1) as well).  A trial court has wide discretion in determining the admissibility of expert testimony, and we will reverse its decision only when there has been a clear abuse of discretion.  Allied Int'l, Inc. v. International Longshoremen's Ass'n, 814 F.2d 32, 40 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 820, 108 S.Ct. 79, 98 L.Ed.2d 41 (1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The expert's vocational evaluation report was based on her review of the plaintiff's medical records and prior work experience, a meeting with the plaintiff during which they discussed his skills and interests, and her review of jobs available in the area.  The expert testified that the information she relied upon was the sort typically used by persons in her field.  The Railroad made no proffer that vocational experts rely on different types of information than did plaintiff's expert.  We think the foundation laid was adequate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the expert's last minute research and the lack of notice to the Railroad, this is a trial management issue within the trial court's discretion.  The trial judge recognized that the expert adhered to the same opinions which had been timely disclosed to the Railroad.  The court quite properly offered to instruct the jury that it should disregard any information the expert acquired after submitting her report.  The Railroad did not take the trial court up on this offer and did not ask for additional time before continuing cross-examination.  There was no abuse in the ruling that the violation of the pre-trial scheduling order did not warrant striking the expert's entire testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Railroad's final claim is that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the issue of damages and that this was sufficiently prejudicial, based on the record as a whole, to warrant a reversal of the judgment.  The question, one of first impression for this court, is which side should prevail on this issue in a FELA action when there is adequate expert testimony that an accident aggravated a pre-existing condition<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> but the jury cannot separate the pain or disability caused by the pre-existing condition from that resulting from the accident.  We believe that the balance tips in favor of compensating the FELA plaintiff, and so uphold the jury instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ample evidence was presented at trial that Stevens suffered from degenerative disk disease prior to his February 1994 accident.  There was also testimony that degenerative disk disease is a process of aging.  However, Stevens presented expert testimony that the accident caused an aggravation of his pre-existing condition.  His treating physician testified that, while \"there must have been some degenerative disk disease present\" before the accident, \"it was silent[,] [s]o he did not feel anything,\" and that the accident caused him to feel the condition for the first time.  There was also evidence, however, that plaintiff had experienced back pain prior to the accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is evidence in this case that plaintiff had a pre-existing injury or condition which existed prior to February 19, 1994.  The railroad is only liable for damages you find to be caused by the occurrence of February 19, 1994.  If you find that plaintiff's pre-existing condition made him more susceptible to injury than a person in good health, the defendant is responsible for all injuries suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the defendant's negligence, even if those injuries are greater than would have been suffered by a person in good health under the same circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If you find that defendant negligently caused further injury or aggravation to plaintiff's pre-existing condition, plaintiff is entitled to compensation for all of plaintiff's damages caused by the incident, including that further injury or aggravation.  If you cannot separate the pain or disability caused by the pre-existing condition from that caused by the occurrence of February 19, 1994, then the defendant is liable for all of plaintiff's injuries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant takes issue with the last sentence.  However, the instructions correctly stated the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that as a general matter, when a defendant's negligence aggravates a plaintiff's pre-existing health condition, the defendant is liable only for the additional increment caused by the negligence and not for the pain and impairment that the plaintiff would have suffered even if the accident had never occurred.  See, e.g., Evans v. United Arab Shipping Co., 790 F.Supp. 516, 519 (D.N.J.1992), aff'd, 4 F.3d 207 (3d Cir.1993);  cf. Shupe v. New York Cent. Sys., 339 F.2d 998, 1000 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 381 U.S. 937, 85 S.Ct. 1769, 14 L.Ed.2d 701 (1965).  Contrary to the defendant's premise, the jury was so instructed here.  But that general statement of law does not provide a complete response to the question of which party prevails when the harm due to the pre-existing condition is inseparable from the harm due to the accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn first to the language of the FELA, which tends to favor the plaintiff but which is not dispositive.  Section 1 of FELA states:  \"[Defendant] shall be liable in damages ... resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of [defendant, its agents, or employees].\"  45 U.S.C. &#167; 51 (emphasis added).  This language suggests, as the jury instruction indicated, that once the plaintiff puts forth credible evidence of causation--that the Railroad's negligence has aggravated a pre-existing condition--the defendant will be liable for damages even if the jury cannot separate the amount of harm caused by the accident from the amount of harm caused by the pre-existing condition.  However, the statutory language does not provide explicit instructions about the appropriate apportionment of damages when the causes of plaintiff's disability are inseparable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More helpful is a consideration of the primary statutory purpose:  \"to eliminate a number of traditional defenses to tort liability and to facilitate recovery in meritorious cases.\"  Atchison T. &amp; S.F. R.R. v. Buell, 480 U.S. 557, 561, 107 S.Ct. 1410, 1413, 94 L.Ed.2d 563 (1987).  \"Specifically, the statute abolished the fellow servant rule, rejected the doctrine of contributory negligence in favor of that of comparative negligence, and prohibited employers from exempting themselves from FELA through contract;  a 1939 amendment abolished the assumption of risk defense.\"  Gottshall, 512 U.S. at ----, 114 S.Ct. at 2404.   Allowing a defendant to escape liability because of the jury's inability to separate the disability due to plaintiff's pre-existing condition from that due to the accident would prevent the plaintiff from recovering damages for the aggravation in what the factfinder has determined to be a meritorious case.  This would defeat the remedial purpose of the statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the statutory language and purpose are not dispositive, \"[t]he third resort of puzzled courts is to policy, principally the policy Congress was seeking to implement in adopting the statute.\"  Wilson v. Bradlees, 96 F.3d 552, 556 (1st Cir.1996).  While we are aware that FELA interpretation is a matter of federal law, the Act is founded on common law concepts subject to explicit statutory qualifications.  Id.  It is therefore appropriate to look to the Restatement of Torts for guidance on the relevant policy issues, as indeed the Supreme Court and the courts of appeals have done in the past.  See, e.g., Gallick v. Baltimore &amp; O. R.R., 372 U.S. 108, 120, 83 S.Ct. 659, 666-67, 9 L.Ed.2d 618 (1963);  Buckley v. Metro-North Commuter R.R., 79 F.3d 1337, 1346 (2d Cir.1996);  Lockard v. Missouri Pac.  R.R., 894 F.2d 299, 305 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 847, 111 S.Ct. 134, 135, 112 L.Ed.2d 102 (1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Restatement provides some assistance in its discussion of apportionment of indivisible damages, explaining:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p>Where two or more causes combine to produce such a single result, incapable of division on any logical or reasonable basis ... the courts have refused to make an arbitrary apportionment ... and each of the causes is charged with responsibility for the entire harm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Restatement (Second) of Torts &#167; 433A(2) cmt. i, at 439 (1965).  Thus, a defendant gets the benefit of apportionment of harm only if \"there is a reasonable basis for determining the contribution of each cause to a single harm.\"  Id. &#167; 433A(1)(b), at 434.  If not, the defendant is liable for the whole.  According to &#167; 433A, both the defendant's negligence and the plaintiff's pre-existing condition are deemed the cause of the entire harm, thus imposing the burden of the whole on both.  But this tie is broken by the congressional intent to implement a policy benefitting injured railway workers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An additional policy argument that supports upholding the jury instruction may be found in the Restatement 's discussion of the related question of who has the burden as to apportionment of damages when such an apportionment is possible:<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reason for the exceptional rule placing the burden of proof as to apportionment upon the defendant or defendants is the injustice of allowing a proved wrongdoer ... to escape liability....

And the principle that indivisible harm results in imposing full liability on defendants is recognized in other areas of federal law as well.  See, e.g., Price v.

The instant case is closely analogous, and the parallel between aggravation of a pre-existing condition and the harm caused by multiple tortfeasors has been drawn by several courts.

Because this case involves an instruction on indivisible injuries, we need not decide the question of who bears the burden as to aggravation of a pre-existing condition when the damages are separable.  However, to the extent that the Railroad is contending that plaintiff bears the entire burden of proving damages, we note that this argument is undercut by the statutory scheme, which makes comparative negligence an affirmative defense.  But cf. Dale v. Baltimore &amp; O. R.R., 520 Pa. 96, 552 A.2d 1037, 1041 (1989) (in FELA case, it was error to instruct jury that \"if it found the railroad negligent, the railroad was responsible for the entirety of damages, whether or not its negligence caused those damages in whole or in part,\" because implicit in the comparative negligence scheme is the principle that defendant is only liable to the extent that its negligence causes harm, whether the other causes are the employee's own negligence or a pre-existing health condition)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> The rule placing the burden as to apportionment on the defendant has also been adopted by at least one court interpreting a similar federal statute.

The jury in his Federal Employers' Liability Act action awarded him $450,000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The Railroad appeals from the verdict and the denial of its motion for a new trial, saying the evidence showed neither negligence nor foreseeability and that certain evidentiary rulings were in error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Railroad raises two issues of weight.  It argues it was unfairly prejudiced by the exclusion of evidence of a cardiac event suffered by plaintiff two weeks before trial.  It also argues that the court erred in instructing the jury that, while defendant was responsible only for the aggravation of a pre-existing condition, the jury must find for plaintiff if it could not separate the injury caused by the condition from that caused by the accident.  These health-related issues require us to address questions not resolved before now in this Circuit.  We affirm, though with some sympathy for the tribulations faced by trial counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury could reasonably have believed the facts to be as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On a winter morning in northern Maine, February 19, 1994, there was a train derailment on the main line to the Millinocket Yard of the Railroad.  The derailment tore up some tracks, which had to be repaired promptly.  The Millinocket Yard is an important junction point, and the oil tank cars that fuel the local industry travel along its main line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">David Stevens, a trackman and machine operator, arrived at the yard around 7 a.m. at the request of his foreman.  Stevens' job involved heavy manual labor, and that morning he helped repair the consequences of the derailment.  After clearing away torn rail and scrap metal, Stevens and a co-worker, David Ireland, were asked to get lengths of rail to repair the damaged track.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rail was kept in the X-198 railcar, known as the \"wreck car.\"   Different weights of thirty-nine foot lengths of rail were piled in the car,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> some lying on their sides, some on their bases.  The rails were in disarray, piled to a height of about two to three feet above the base of the car.  Their surface was uneven and there were irregular gaps between the pieces of rail.  In violation of the Railroad's own safety rules, the wreck car had been loaded using inappropriate equipment and had not been blocked, thus leading to the gaps between the rails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stevens' task was to climb onto the rails in the wreck car and position the rails so that his co-worker, Ireland, operating a machine called a pettibone, could secure the rail with the pettibone's tongs.  Stevens first shoveled snow and ice off the portion of the wreck car where he needed to work.  The two men then successfully offloaded six rails, with Ireland operating the pettibone in response to Stevens' hand signals.  Then Stevens, standing atop the rails in the wreck car, reached up for the tongs of the pettibone to guide it down to the seventh rail.  He slipped and fell.  His right leg, up to his groin, went down a gap in the rails.  He twisted as he fell and felt a sharp pain in his back.  With difficulty and great pain, he extricated himself.  Declining co-workers' offers to take him to the hospital and wanting to earn the $20 an hour overtime pay, Stevens continued working for eighteen more hours.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When he went home, the pain continued, as it did when he returned to work on February 25, 1994.  On February 28, unable to continue working due to the pain, he went to the hospital.  He was first diagnosed with lumbar strain, but when physical therapy did not improve his condition, his orthopedic surgeon ordered an MRI, which showed early degenerative disk disease and some narrowing of the disks.  He has since been in physical and occupational therapy, unable to return to his job because his back pain disables him from physical labor.  Jobs in his area of Maine are few and far between, particularly once employment requiring heavy manual labor is excluded.  Stevens, who is married and has children, works sporadically as an animal control officer at about $75 a week and earns small sums as the owner of a delivery truck.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before Stevens' accident, the Railroad had at times loaded the rails onto transport cars in a regular tiered fashion.  The Railroad had decided even before the accident to switch to this system for the wreck car because it would be more efficient.  It would also be safer because it would be easier for the pettibone operator to grab the rails and so reduce the need for a trackman to climb onto the rails to guide the pettibone's tongs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>Sufficiency of the Evidence and New Trial Motion</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Federal Employers' Liability Act was enacted in 1908 to provide railroad workers with a federal remedy for personal injuries suffered as a result of the negligence of their employers or fellow workers.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">459</span></span> (1984).  FELA provides that railroad employers are liable for injuries to their employees \"resulting in whole or in part \" from the employer's negligence.  45 U.S.C. &#167; 51 (emphasis added);  see also Robert, 832 F.2d at 6 (\"[U]nder FELA negligent employers cannot escape liability merely because other causes contribute to the injury.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Measured against these standards, the evidence was sufficient to impose liability.  The Railroad argues that there was no negligence on its part causing Stevens to slip and no way for it to foresee that Stevens would be injured.  Neither the challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence nor the appeal from the denial of the new trial motion is well taken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stevens was injured when he fell into a gap between the rails created by their haphazard arrangement in the wreck car.  The disarray also increased the number of times the trackman had to climb atop the rails in the wreck car to help the pettibone operator, thus making it more likely a worker would fall and slip into a gap between the rails.  Although Stevens had cleared away the ice and snow from the area where he was working, it was certainly foreseeable that, given the uncertain footing underneath, a trackman would fall.  It was also foreseeable that on falling, he would slip into a gap and be injured or suffer greater injuries than he otherwise would have.  Stevens has proffered more than enough to meet his burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Subsequent Remedial Measures</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Railroad claims that two items of evidence--a post-accident photograph of a wreck car whose rails are arranged in a tiered fashion, and references to comments made at a company safety meeting following the accident--were admitted into evidence in violation of Fed.R.Evid. 407, which prohibits the introduction of a defendant's subsequent remedial measures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We doubt that Rule 407 applies at all here.  As to the photograph showing a car with the rails arranged in tiers,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> the jury was told only that it depicted an arrangement of the type Stevens had seen on other cars on which he had worked before his accident.  The jury was not informed of the date of the photograph and was not told that it portrayed a subsequent remedial measure.  The photograph was properly admitted to show the Railroad's past practice and standard of care.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury also did not know that the challenged references to statements by Mr. Cote, the Railroad's roadmaster, concerned statements made during a post-accident safety meeting.  The references to Cote's statements were supported by notes taken by one of the Railroad's foremen, Thomas Bell.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The jury never saw the notes, and the references to Cote's statements were admitted for impeachment purposes only.  Cote had testified that he had never stated the rails on the wreck car were in disarray at the time of the plaintiff's accident and that he remembered the rails as having been arranged neatly.  His later statement about the condition of the rails at the time of the accident could be understood to be to the contrary and was thus fair game.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, because the evidence was not presented to the jury directly or by inference as subsequent remedial measures, Rule 407 does not apply.  Even if Rule 407 applied, the exception within the rule would also apply:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>This rule does not require the exclusion of evidence of subsequent measures when offered for another purpose, such as proving ownership, control, or feasibility of precautionary measures, if controverted, or impeachment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This evidence fell within the exception.

Stevens was diagnosed with a threatened anterior septal myocardial infarction<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and was released on November 14, 1995.  The parties agreed that the cardiac event was not caused in any way by Stevens' accident or consequent injuries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Railroad was not permitted to cross-examine Stevens about his cardiac event or to introduce the medical records into evidence.  The Railroad argued that such examination was pertinent to Stevens' life and work expectancy.  The court excluded all evidence about the cardiac event because the Railroad failed to proffer expert testimony to link it to life expectancy or work expectancy.  Absent such testimony the court felt that the evidence would have been speculative and unduly prejudicial.  The trial court also excluded the evidence in part based on its understanding \"that any independent event that the defendant is not responsible for in reference to his health and condition could not be considered by [the jury] for purposes of awarding damages.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This latter basis for the trial court's ruling was erroneous.  If post-accident health problems have an impact on a plaintiff's ability to work or on his life expectancy and arise independently of the accident, defendant is entitled to adduce evidence of such problems in an effort to reduce a potential damages award.

Here, the Railroad commendably concedes that in the ordinary course, evidence of unrelated post-accident health problems without medical testimony as to their effect on plaintiff's life and work expectancy would be unduly speculative.  See, e.g., Meller v.

The Railroad says that it did not have enough time to develop such testimony, that the court denied its motion for a continuance,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and that the exclusion was therefore error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although close, we find no abuse of discretion in light of three factors.  First, the timing, while difficult, was far from impossible.  The Railroad acknowledges that it received notification of the plaintiff's myocardial event at least ten days before the trial was scheduled to begin.  Nothing prevented the defendant from starting to look for an expert witness at that time.  The Railroad was promptly given the medical records, and it interviewed the attending physician.  The defendant did not begin to put on its case until December 4, effectively giving it over two weeks (albeit subject to the Thanksgiving holiday weekend), to locate an expert witness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, there is very little evidence establishing prejudice to the Railroad.  There was no offer of proof as to what a potential cardiologist expert witness would say to link the cardiac event causally to the legal issues.  We are left not knowing whether there is, in fact, any colorable claim of linkage.  There is not even a clear record of when the Railroad first received the hospital records or what steps it took in response, although at oral argument both counsel attempted to recreate the sequence from memory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, during the trial, well after it received notice of the plaintiff's cardiac event, the Railroad entered into a stipulation based on mortality tables as to the life and work expectancy of a typical man of plaintiff's age who was of average health.  The jury was instructed that it could consider the stipulation along with other evidence.  In the face of the stipulation and the absence of even a proffer to link the cardiac event to plaintiff's life and work expectancy, it was hardly an abuse of discretion for the court to exclude the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Vocational Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, we reject the challenge to the testimony of plaintiff's vocational expert.  The Railroad says the testimony lacked adequate factual basis and complains that it was sandbagged when, on cross-examination, it learned for the first time that the expert had updated her research just before and during the trial in violation of a pre-trial scheduling order (and, although not mentioned by the defendant, of Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(e)(1) as well).  A trial court has wide discretion in determining the admissibility of expert testimony, and we will reverse its decision only when there has been a clear abuse of discretion.  Allied Int'l, Inc. v.

The expert testified that the information she relied upon was the sort typically used by persons in her field.  The Railroad made no proffer that vocational experts rely on different types of information than did plaintiff's expert.  We think the foundation laid was adequate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the expert's last minute research and the lack of notice to the Railroad, this is a trial management issue within the trial court's discretion.  The trial judge recognized that the expert adhered to the same opinions which had been timely disclosed to the Railroad.  The court quite properly offered to instruct the jury that it should disregard any information the expert acquired after submitting her report.  The Railroad did not take the trial court up on this offer and did not ask for additional time before continuing cross-examination.  There was no abuse in the ruling that the violation of the pre-trial scheduling order did not warrant striking the expert's entire testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Railroad's final claim is that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the issue of damages and that this was sufficiently prejudicial, based on the record as a whole, to warrant a reversal of the judgment.  The question, one of first impression for this court, is which side should prevail on this issue in a FELA action when there is adequate expert testimony that an accident aggravated a pre-existing condition<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> but the jury cannot separate the pain or disability caused by the pre-existing condition from that resulting from the accident.  We believe that the balance tips in favor of compensating the FELA plaintiff, and so uphold the jury instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ample evidence was presented at trial that Stevens suffered from degenerative disk disease prior to his February 1994 accident.  There was also testimony that degenerative disk disease is a process of aging.  However, Stevens presented expert testimony that the accident caused an aggravation of his pre-existing condition.  His treating physician testified that, while \"there must have been some degenerative disk disease present\" before the accident, \"it was silent[,] [s]o he did not feel anything,\" and that the accident caused him to feel the condition for the first time.  There was also evidence, however, that plaintiff had experienced back pain prior to the accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is evidence in this case that plaintiff had a pre-existing injury or condition which existed prior to February 19, 1994.  The railroad is only liable for damages you find to be caused by the occurrence of February 19, 1994.  If you find that plaintiff's pre-existing condition made him more susceptible to injury than a person in good health, the defendant is responsible for all injuries suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the defendant's negligence, even if those injuries are greater than would have been suffered by a person in good health under the same circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If you find that defendant negligently caused further injury or aggravation to plaintiff's pre-existing condition, plaintiff is entitled to compensation for all of plaintiff's damages caused by the incident, including that further injury or aggravation.  If you cannot separate the pain or disability caused by the pre-existing condition from that caused by the occurrence of February 19, 1994, then the defendant is liable for all of plaintiff's injuries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant takes issue with the last sentence.

But that general statement of law does not provide a complete response to the question of which party prevails when the harm due to the pre-existing condition is inseparable from the harm due to the accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn first to the language of the FELA, which tends to favor the plaintiff but which is not dispositive.  Section 1 of FELA states:  \"[Defendant] shall be liable in damages ... resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of [defendant, its agents, or employees].\"  45 U.S.C. &#167; 51 (emphasis added).  This language suggests, as the jury instruction indicated, that once the plaintiff puts forth credible evidence of causation--that the Railroad's negligence has aggravated a pre-existing condition--the defendant will be liable for damages even if the jury cannot separate the amount of harm caused by the accident from the amount of harm caused by the pre-existing condition.  However, the statutory language does not provide explicit instructions about the appropriate apportionment of damages when the causes of plaintiff's disability are inseparable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More helpful is a consideration of the primary statutory purpose:  \"to eliminate a number of traditional defenses to tort liability and to facilitate recovery in meritorious cases.\"  Atchison T. &amp; S.F.

Allowing a defendant to escape liability because of the jury's inability to separate the disability due to plaintiff's pre-existing condition from that due to the accident would prevent the plaintiff from recovering damages for the aggravation in what the factfinder has determined to be a meritorious case.  This would defeat the remedial purpose of the statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the statutory language and purpose are not dispositive, \"[t]he third resort of puzzled courts is to policy, principally the policy Congress was seeking to implement in adopting the statute.\"  Wilson v.

However, given discovery of medical records and the availability of medical examinations of plaintiff by defendant's doctor, Fed.R.Civ.P. 35, it is not unfair to place on defendant that burden and the consequences of not meeting it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore think the better rule, particularly in light of FELA's broad remedial purposes, is that if the factfinder cannot separate injuries caused or exacerbated by the accident from those resulting from a pre-existing condition, the defendant is liable for all such injuries.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The jury found the Railroad responsible for 90% of Stevens' injuries;  Stevens responsible for 10%</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The \"weight\" of a rail is the weight in pounds of a three foot section.  This car had varying lengths of 100 pound, 112 pound, and 115 pound rail, each of which has a somewhat different shape and size</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The photograph was a fair representation of rails aligned in a row, same sides up, which Stevens had walked on in other cars prior to the accident.  It showed a different, less dangerous alignment than the alignment in the wreck car on which he was injured</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The notes said that, \"Rails still coming in from Derby on supply cars a mess rails every which way and Holes in the floor of car....  RNC [Robert N.

The court denied the continuance based on that representation and directed plaintiff's counsel to give the defense all the medical information it had.  The hospital records were promptly provided.  No specific request was made for a continuance in order to locate an expert witness</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> This case does not involve the problem of the admissibility of the expert's testimony if the expert is unable to ascertain whether the trauma of the accident would exacerbate a prior condition of this particular patient.  Cf. Rotman v. National R.R. Passenger Corp., 41 Mass.App.Ct. 317, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">669</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1090</span></span> (1996)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Indeed, FELA and other federal statutes incorporate the \"eggshell skull\" rule to prevent defendant from avoiding liability in certain cases.  See, e.g., Jordan v. Atchison, T. &amp; S.F. Ry., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"561880\"><a href=\"/opinion/561880/john-m-jordan-v-atchison-topeka-and-santa-fe-railway-company-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">934</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">225</span></a></span>, 228-29 (9th Cir.1991) (FELA case noting that it is a well-settled principle of tort law that the defendant must take the plaintiff as it finds him);  cf. Avitia v. Metropolitan Club of Chicago, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"691350\"><a href=\"/opinion/691350/alfonso-avitia-and-diane-larsen-v-metropolitan-club-of-chicago/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1219</span></a></span>, 1227-28 (7th Cir.1995) (same under Fair Labor Standards Act);  Doty v. Sewall, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"545153\"><a href=\"/opinion/545153/arthur-doty-v-richard-sewall-arthur-doty-v-richard-sewall/\"><span class=\"volume\">908</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1053</span></a></span>, 1059 (1st Cir.1990) (same under Landrum-Griffin Act).  And the principle that indivisible harm results in imposing full liability on defendants is recognized in other areas of federal law as well.  See, e.g., Price v. United States Navy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"681684\"><a href=\"/opinion/681684/gloria-price-v-united-states-navy-harry-moses-marguerite-moses-deceased/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1011</span></a></span>, 1018 (9th Cir.1994) (CERCLA)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The illustrations for the above quoted Restatement comments are primarily taken from cases involving multiple tortfeasors.  However, the Restatement indicates that \"[s]uch entire liability is imposed where some of the causes are innocent....\"  Id. &#167; 433A(2) cmt. i, at 439;  cf. id. app. at 140 (1966) (noting that \"as to an original injury followed by negligent treatment,\" the treating physician \"is liable only for the aggravation he has caused\").  The instant case is closely analogous, and the parallel between aggravation of a pre-existing condition and the harm caused by multiple tortfeasors has been drawn by several courts.  See, e.g., Lovely v. Allstate Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1972076\"><a href=\"/opinion/1972076/lovely-v-allstate-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">658</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1091</span></a></span>, 1092 (Me.1995)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> At trial, defendant asked for a jury instruction indicating that if the causes of plaintiff's injuries were separable, plaintiff had the burden of proof on the extent to which the accident caused the aggravation of the pre-existing condition.  Because this case involves an instruction on indivisible injuries, we need not decide the question of who bears the burden as to aggravation of a pre-existing condition when the damages are separable.  However, to the extent that the Railroad is contending that plaintiff bears the entire burden of proving damages, we note that this argument is undercut by the statutory scheme, which makes comparative negligence an affirmative defense.  But cf. Dale v. Baltimore &amp; O. R.R., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1992396\"><a href=\"/opinion/1992396/dale-v-baltimore-ohio-r-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pa.</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1992396\"><a href=\"/opinion/1992396/dale-v-baltimore-ohio-r-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">552</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1037</span></a></span>, 1041 (1989) (in FELA case, it was error to instruct jury that \"if it found the railroad negligent, the railroad was responsible for the entirety of damages, whether or not its negligence caused those damages in whole or in part,\" because implicit in the comparative negligence scheme is the principle that defendant is only liable to the extent that its negligence causes harm, whether the other causes are the employee's own negligence or a pre-existing health condition)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> The rule placing the burden as to apportionment on the defendant has also been adopted by at least one court interpreting a similar federal statute.

United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"398652\"><a href=\"/opinion/398652/louis-a-maurer-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">668</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></a></span>, 100 (2d Cir.1981) (Public Vessels Act)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> Cf.
