Appellants raise various\n\nchallenges to their convictions for trespassing that arose out of\n\nprotests at a United States Naval installation in Vieques, Puerto Rico.\n\nBecause we find these challenges unpersuasive, we affirm.\n\n                             Background\n\n          Appellants, whose cases have been consolidated for purposes\n\nof appeal, were arrested at various times between April and June of\n\n2000 for trespassing onto Camp García, a United States Naval\n\ninstallation located on the island of Vieques, Puerto Rico. Pursuant\n\nto regulations promulgated by the Department of the Navy, Camp García\n\nis a \"closed\" base, meaning that the public may not enter without\n\npermission from the commanding officer. 32 C.F.R. §§ 770.35-770.40\n\n(2001). Appellants entered Camp García, without authorization, to\n\nprotest and interfere with the military exercises occurring there.\n\nAppellants alleged that the Navy's activities, including live-fire\n\nartillery and bombardment exercises, were causing civilian deaths,\n\nserious health threats to Vieques' residents, and environmental damage.\n\n          Either before or during their trials in the district court,\n\nappellants made offers of proof or attempted to assert the defense of\n\nnecessity. In each case, the district court ruled that the necessity\n\ndefense was irrelevant and excluded the presentation of this defense.\n\n          Following bench trials, appellants were all convicted of\n\nviolating 18 U.S.C. § 1382 (1994), which prohibits entry onto a\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fmilitary base \"for any purpose prohibited by law or lawful regulation,\"\n\nincluding entry onto a U.S. Naval installation in Puerto Rico without\n\nadvance permission. See 32 C.F.R. §§ 770.38, 770.40. Appellants\n\nreceived various sentences for this Class B misdemeanor. They now\n\nappeal their convictions.\n\n                              Analysis\n\n          Appellants raise four separate challenges to their\n\nconvictions.   We address each in turn.\n\nA.   Failure to Prove the Unlawful Purpose Element of Statute\n\n          The trespassing statute under which appellants were convicted\n\nforbids the entry onto any military installation \"for any purpose\n\nprohibited by law or lawful regulation.\" 18 U.S.C. § 1382. Appellant\n\nSued-Jiménez argues that the government failed to prove this unlawful\n\npurpose element because the government did not introduce any evidence\n\nat trial, such as warning signs, to demonstrate that appellant knew he\n\nwas illegally entering Camp García. Without any evidence to show that\n\nappellant knew his entry was illegal, appellant asserts that his entry\n\ncould not have been for an illegal purpose.\n\n          This is not the first time this argument has been raised in\n\nappeals from convictions under § 1382. See, e.g., United States v.\n\nMaxwell, 254 F.3d 21, 24-25 (1st Cir. 2001). We have previously held\n\nthat a showing of illegal purpose for entry onto a restricted military\n\nbase requires two elements: deliberate entry onto the base and\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fknowledge or notice that such entry was prohibited. See id. at 24. In\n\nMaxwell, another appeal from a section 1382 conviction for protesting\n\nin Vieques, we held that the Department of the Navy's regulations,\n\npromulgated at 32 C.F.R. §§ 770.35-770.40, are sufficient to satisfy\n\nthe knowledge or notice requirement that military installations in\n\nPuerto Rico are off limits to the public. See Maxwell, 254 F.3d at 24-\n\n25. Thus, all the government has to prove at trial to satisfy the\n\nillegal purpose element is that the defendant deliberately entered the\n\nnaval base.   See id. at 25.\n\n          In this case, appellant admitted at trial that he entered\n\nonto the naval base without authorization. Moreover, appellant's\n\nintended purpose was to enter onto the Navy's land to protest the\n\nmilitary activities occurring there. Therefore, the government has\n\nundeniably satisfied its burden of proving deliberate entry. As a\n\nresult, appellant's argument that the illegal purpose element was not\n\nsatisfied lacks merit.\n\nB.   The Necessity Defense\n\n          Appellants collectively assert that the district court erred\n\nby finding the defense of necessity irrelevant to their trespassing\n\nconvictions and therefore barring its presentation (and related expert\n\ntestimony) at trial.\n\n          To successfully assert the necessity defense, a defendant\n\nmust show that he (1) was faced with a choice of evils and chose the\n\n\n                                -14-\n\flesser evil, (2) acted to prevent imminent harm, (3) reasonably\n\nanticipated a direct causal relationship between his acts and the harm\n\nto be averted, and (4) had no legal alternative. See Maxwell, 254 F.3d\n\nat 27. However, if a defendant's proffer of evidence to support the\n\ndefense is insufficient as a matter of law, the court can bar\n\npresentation of the defense. See id. at 26. Because the elements of\n\nthe necessity defense are conjunctive, the defense may be precluded\n\nentirely if proof of any one of the four prongs is lacking. See United\n\nStates v. Schoon, 971 F.2d 193, 195 (9th Cir. 1992).\n\n          Appellants argue that their illegal entry into Camp García\n\nwas necessary to prevent the greater imminent harms of civilian deaths,\n\nhealth threats, and environmental damages that they say are posed by\n\nthe military exercises being conducted there. Second, they assert that\n\ntheir presence in Camp García will necessarily bring a halt to the\n\nNavy's exercises and the concomitant risks that arise from those\n\nactivities. Finally, appellants contend that they have exhausted all\n\nother legal alternatives, such as seeking temporary restraining orders\n\nand the scheduled referendum,1 and that such alternatives have either\n\nbeen fruitless or have failed to bring about a sufficiently prompt\n\nresolution. The district court, determining that these allegations\n\n1 At the time of appellants' protests, a referendum had been scheduled\nto be held by February 2002 in which residents of Vieques would be\nasked whether they want U.S. troops to leave by May 1, 2003 or to stay\nindefinitely in exchange for $50 million in economic aid. In the\nmeantime, the Navy agreed to use dummy munitions.\n\n                                 -15-\n\fwere insufficient to support the necessity defense as a matter of law,\n\nexcluded the defense.\n\n          The district court's decision to preclude the necessity\n\ndefense can most easily be affirmed by examining appellants' proffered\n\nevidence as to the last two components of the defense: reasonable\n\nanticipation of averting the alleged harm and no legal alternatives.\n\nAppellants offered no evidence to support their claim that their\n\ntrespassory protests will result in a change of U.S. Naval policy so\n\nthat the bombing and ammunition testing in Vieques will cease. See\n\nMaxwell, 254 F.3d at 28 (noting that a \"defendant must demonstrate\n\ncause and effect between an act of protest and the achievement of the\n\ngoal of the protest by competent evidence\"). In fact, the Navy has\n\nexperienced numerous protests in Camp García, yet none has effected\n\nmore than a temporary cessation of military activities there. See id.\n\nat 23, 28 (discussing only temporary disruptions caused by past\n\nprotests); United States v. Sharpton, 252 F.3d 536, 538-39 (1st Cir.\n\n2001) (per curiam) (same).\n\n          Appellants also failed to offer sufficient evidence to\n\ndemonstrate a lack of legal alternatives. Although appellants cite\n\nunsuccessful attempts to obtain temporary restraining orders against\n\nthe U.S. Navy, they have not demonstrated an exhaustion of all legal\n\noptions. See Maxwell, 254 F.3d at 28 (exploring several legal avenues\n\nwithout results does not demonstrate exhaustion of legal alternatives).\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\fMoreover, appellants cannot claim they have no legal alternatives\n\nmerely because their law-abiding efforts are unlikely to effect a\n\nchange in policy as soon as they would like. See id. at 29 (stating\n\nthat a possibility of succeeding through legal alternatives, even if\n\nunlikely, does not mean that those alternatives are \"nonexistent\").\n\nThis is true even for residents of Puerto Rico, who may have fewer\n\noptions for effecting political change since they are not directly\n\nrepresented in Congress. See id. at 29 (rejecting argument that all\n\nlegal alternatives were foreclosed because defendant was a citizen of\n\nPuerto Rico); Igartúa de la Rosa v. United States, 229 F.3d 80, 88 (1st\n\nCir. 2000) (Torruella, J., concurring) (stating that \"Puerto Rico\n\nremains a colony with little prospect of exerting effective political\n\npressure on the elected branches of government to take corrective\n\naction\"); Schoon, 971 F.2d at 198 (asserting that legal alternatives\n\ncan never be exhausted when the harm could be mitigated through\n\ncongressional action). See generally Trailer Marine Transp. Corp. v.\n\nRivera Vázquez, 977 F.2d 1, 6-7 (1st Cir. 1992) (discussing status of\n\nPuerto Rico).\n\n          Because appellants have not proffered sufficient evidence to\n\nsupport the third or fourth prongs of the necessity defense, the\n\ndistrict court properly precluded the defense, as well as any evidence\n\nrelevant to the defense. As such, we need not address whether the\n\nalleged harm, if true, constitutes a \"greater evil\" than trespassing,\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fsee Maxwell, 254 F.3d at 27 (assuming, but not deciding, that\n\ndefendant's trespassory protest was a \"lesser evil\" than the harm posed\n\nby nuclear-armed submarines allegedly participating in Navy exercises\n\nin Vieques), or whether the alleged risks to health, life, and the\n\nenvironment, though cumulative over time, could qualify as \"imminent\"\n\nharm, see id. at 27 (defining \"imminent harm\" as a \"real emergency\"\n\ninvolving \"immediate danger\").\n\n\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\fC.   Discovery as to Use of Non-Conventional Weapons\n\n          All appellants, except Sued-Jiménez, collectively assert that\n\nthe district court erred in not permitting discovery on the\n\ngovernment's alleged use of non-conventional weapons in Vieques' Live\n\nImpact Area.2 Appellants seek evidence, if it exists, on the use of\n\nnon-conventional weapons to support their allegation that the Navy's\n\nactivities present an imminent health threat to Vieques' residents and\n\nare therefore a \"greater evil\" than trespassing. In other words,\n\nappellants requested discovery because it was relevant to the first and\n\nsecond elements of the necessity defense.\n\n          Given our affirmance of the district court's preclusion of\n\nthe necessity defense, any evidence relating to this defense that might\n\nbe obtained through discovery is irrelevant.3 Thus, government-held\n\nevidence relating to the alleged use of non-conventional weapons is not\n\nmaterial to the case and need not be disclosed to defendants. See Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P. 16(a)(1) (providing that government need only disclose\n\nevidence that is material to the defendant's defense). As a result, it\n\nwas not error for the district court to refuse to order the requested\n\ndiscovery.\n\n\n2 The Live Impact Area is the section of Camp García where the live-\nfire artillery and bombardment exercises occur.\n3 This is all the more true because appellants only seek discovery of\nevidence relevant to the first two prongs of the necessity defense, the\nmerits of which we have declined to address or rely upon in affirming\nthe district court's preclusion of the defense.\n\n                                 -19-\n\fD.   Speedy Trial Act Claim\n\n          Appellant Agosto-Hernández appeals her conviction on the\n\nadditional ground that it allegedly violates the Speedy Trial Act, 18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 3161-3174 (1994). A criminal complaint was filed against\n\nAgosto-Hernández on June 25, 2000, the same day she was arrested. An\n\ninformation was filed against her on June 29, 2000, and she was\n\narraigned on August 28, 2000. Appellant pled not guilty, and the\n\ngovernment moved to dismiss the criminal complaint that had previously\n\nbeen filed. At a status conference on December 13, 2000, appellant\n\nannounced that she would move for a dismissal based on the Speedy Trial\n\nAct. On December 20, 2000, she filed her motion to dismiss, alleging\n\nthat more than 70 days had elapsed between her plea of not guilty and\n\ntrial.   The district court denied the motion and appellant appeals.\n\n          The Speedy Trial Act provides that when a defendant pleads\n\nnot guilty to \"the commission of an offense,\" the trial must occur\n\nwithin seventy days from the date the information or indictment was\n\nfiled, or from the date the defendant appeared before the court where\n\nthe charge is pending, whichever is later. See 18 U.S.C. § 3161(c)(1).\n\nIf the Act is violated, the charges will be dismissed on defendant's\n\nmotion for failure to comply with this time table. See 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3162(a)(2).\n\n          The Speedy Trial Act, however, only applies to defendants\n\ncharged with an \"offense,\" which is defined as \"any Federal criminal\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\foffense which is in violation of any Act of Congress and is triable by\n\na court established by Act of Congress (other than a Class B or C\n\nmisdemeanor . . . ).\"    18 U.S.C. § 3172(2).    Thus, Class B and C\n\nmisdemeanors are explicitly excluded from the Act's coverage. The\n\ncriminal trespassing statute at issue here, 18 U.S.C. § 1382, is\n\nclassified as a Class B misdemeanor. See 18 U.S.C. § 1382 (authorizing\n\nup to six months' imprisonment); 18 U.S.C. § 3559(a)(7) (1994)\n\n(classifying a criminal offense with a maximum sentence of six months\n\nas a Class B misdemeanor); see also Sharpton, 252 F.3d at 540. As a\n\nresult, the Speedy Trial Act does not apply to the criminal charge\n\nagainst appellant.    See 18 U.S.C. § 3172(2) (excluding Class B\n\nmisdemeanors from Act's coverage); see also United States v. Boyd, 214\n\nF.3d 1052, 1057 (9th Cir. 2000) (stating that Speedy Trial Act does not\n\napply to trespass onto a military base).\n\n          Thus, appellant's policy-based argument that the Speedy Trial\n\nAct should apply to her case, despite the clear language of the Act,\n\nmust fail because it is directly contrary to the Act's provisions.\n\n                             Conclusion\n\n          Because we find no error in the district court's rulings, we\n\naffirm.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\f",

Appellants raise various\n\nchallenges to their convictions for trespassing that arose out of\n\nprotests at a United States Naval installation in Vieques, Puerto Rico.\n\nBecause we find these challenges unpersuasive, we affirm.\n\n                             Background\n\n          Appellants, whose cases have been consolidated for purposes\n\nof appeal, were arrested at various times between April and June of\n\n2000 for trespassing onto Camp García, a United States Naval\n\ninstallation located on the island of Vieques, Puerto Rico. Pursuant\n\nto regulations promulgated by the Department of the Navy, Camp García\n\nis a \"closed\" base, meaning that the public may not enter without\n\npermission from the commanding officer. 32 C.F.R. §§ 770.35-770.40\n\n(2001). Appellants entered Camp García, without authorization, to\n\nprotest and interfere with the military exercises occurring there.\n\nAppellants alleged that the Navy's activities, including live-fire\n\nartillery and bombardment exercises, were causing civilian deaths,\n\nserious health threats to Vieques' residents, and environmental damage.\n\n          Either before or during their trials in the district court,\n\nappellants made offers of proof or attempted to assert the defense of\n\nnecessity. In each case, the district court ruled that the necessity\n\ndefense was irrelevant and excluded the presentation of this defense.\n\n          Following bench trials, appellants were all convicted of\n\nviolating 18 U.S.C. § 1382 (1994), which prohibits entry onto a\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fmilitary base \"for any purpose prohibited by law or lawful regulation,\"\n\nincluding entry onto a U.S. Naval installation in Puerto Rico without\n\nadvance permission. See 32 C.F.R. §§ 770.38, 770.40. Appellants\n\nreceived various sentences for this Class B misdemeanor. They now\n\nappeal their convictions.\n\n                              Analysis\n\n          Appellants raise four separate challenges to their\n\nconvictions.   We address each in turn.\n\nA.   Failure to Prove the Unlawful Purpose Element of Statute\n\n          The trespassing statute under which appellants were convicted\n\nforbids the entry onto any military installation \"for any purpose\n\nprohibited by law or lawful regulation.\" 18 U.S.C. § 1382. Appellant\n\nSued-Jiménez argues that the government failed to prove this unlawful\n\npurpose element because the government did not introduce any evidence\n\nat trial, such as warning signs, to demonstrate that appellant knew he\n\nwas illegally entering Camp García. Without any evidence to show that\n\nappellant knew his entry was illegal, appellant asserts that his entry\n\ncould not have been for an illegal purpose.\n\n          This is not the first time this argument has been raised in\n\nappeals from convictions under § 1382. See, e.g., United States v.\n\nMaxwell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199478\"><a href=\"/opinion/199478/united-states-v-maxwell-anthony/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 24-25 (1st Cir. 2001). We have previously held\n\nthat a showing of illegal purpose for entry onto a restricted military\n\nbase requires two elements: deliberate entry onto the base and\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fknowledge or notice that such entry was prohibited. See id. at 24. In\n\nMaxwell, another appeal from a section 1382 conviction for protesting\n\nin Vieques, we held that the Department of the Navy's regulations,\n\npromulgated at 32 C.F.R. §§ 770.35-770.40, are sufficient to satisfy\n\nthe knowledge or notice requirement that military installations in\n\nPuerto Rico are off limits to the public. See Maxwell, 254 F.3d at 24-\n\n25. Thus, all the government has to prove at trial to satisfy the\n\nillegal purpose element is that the defendant deliberately entered the\n\nnaval base.   See id. at 25.\n\n          In this case, appellant admitted at trial that he entered\n\nonto the naval base without authorization. Moreover, appellant's\n\nintended purpose was to enter onto the Navy's land to protest the\n\nmilitary activities occurring there. Therefore, the government has\n\nundeniably satisfied its burden of proving deliberate entry. As a\n\nresult, appellant's argument that the illegal purpose element was not\n\nsatisfied lacks merit.\n\nB.   The Necessity Defense\n\n          Appellants collectively assert that the district court erred\n\nby finding the defense of necessity irrelevant to their trespassing\n\nconvictions and therefore barring its presentation (and related expert\n\ntestimony) at trial.\n\n          To successfully assert the necessity defense, a defendant\n\nmust show that he (1) was faced with a choice of evils and chose the\n\n\n                                -14-\n\flesser evil, (2) acted to prevent imminent harm, (3) reasonably\n\nanticipated a direct causal relationship between his acts and the harm\n\nto be averted, and (4) had no legal alternative. See Maxwell, 254 F.3d\n\nat 27. However, if a defendant's proffer of evidence to support the\n\ndefense is insufficient as a matter of law, the court can bar\n\npresentation of the defense. See id. at 26. Because the elements of\n\nthe necessity defense are conjunctive, the defense may be precluded\n\nentirely if proof of any one of the four prongs is lacking. See United\n\nStates v. Schoon, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">971</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 195 (9th Cir. 1992).\n\n          Appellants argue that their illegal entry into Camp García\n\nwas necessary to prevent the greater imminent harms of civilian deaths,\n\nhealth threats, and environmental damages that they say are posed by\n\nthe military exercises being conducted there. Second, they assert that\n\ntheir presence in Camp García will necessarily bring a halt to the\n\nNavy's exercises and the concomitant risks that arise from those\n\nactivities. Finally, appellants contend that they have exhausted all\n\nother legal alternatives, such as seeking temporary restraining orders\n\nand the scheduled referendum,1 and that such alternatives have either\n\nbeen fruitless or have failed to bring about a sufficiently prompt\n\nresolution. The district court, determining that these allegations\n\n1 At the time of appellants' protests, a referendum had been scheduled\nto be held by February 2002 in which residents of Vieques would be\nasked whether they want U.S. troops to leave by May 1, 2003 or to stay\nindefinitely in exchange for $50 million in economic aid. In the\nmeantime, the Navy agreed to use dummy munitions.\n\n                                 -15-\n\fwere insufficient to support the necessity defense as a matter of law,\n\nexcluded the defense.\n\n          The district court's decision to preclude the necessity\n\ndefense can most easily be affirmed by examining appellants' proffered\n\nevidence as to the last two components of the defense: reasonable\n\nanticipation of averting the alleged harm and no legal alternatives.\n\nAppellants offered no evidence to support their claim that their\n\ntrespassory protests will result in a change of U.S. Naval policy so\n\nthat the bombing and ammunition testing in Vieques will cease. See\n\nMaxwell, 254 F.3d at 28 (noting that a \"defendant must demonstrate\n\ncause and effect between an act of protest and the achievement of the\n\ngoal of the protest by competent evidence\"). In fact, the Navy has\n\nexperienced numerous protests in Camp García, yet none has effected\n\nmore than a temporary cessation of military activities there. See id.\n\nat 23, 28 (discussing only temporary disruptions caused by past\n\nprotests); United States v. Sharpton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199452\"><a href=\"/opinion/199452/united-states-v-sharpton/\"><span class=\"volume\">252</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">536</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 538-39 (1st Cir.\n\n2001) (per curiam) (same).\n\n          Appellants also failed to offer sufficient evidence to\n\ndemonstrate a lack of legal alternatives. Although appellants cite\n\nunsuccessful attempts to obtain temporary restraining orders against\n\nthe U.S. Navy, they have not demonstrated an exhaustion of all legal\n\noptions. See Maxwell, 254 F.3d at 28 (exploring several legal avenues\n\nwithout results does not demonstrate exhaustion of legal alternatives).\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\fMoreover, appellants cannot claim they have no legal alternatives\n\nmerely because their law-abiding efforts are unlikely to effect a\n\nchange in policy as soon as they would like. See id. at 29 (stating\n\nthat a possibility of succeeding through legal alternatives, even if\n\nunlikely, does not mean that those alternatives are \"nonexistent\").\n\nThis is true even for residents of Puerto Rico, who may have fewer\n\noptions for effecting political change since they are not directly\n\nrepresented in Congress. See id. at 29 (rejecting argument that all\n\nlegal alternatives were foreclosed because defendant was a citizen of\n\nPuerto Rico); Igartúa de la Rosa v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199125\"><a href=\"/opinion/199125/igartua-de-la-rosa-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 88 (1st\n\nCir. 2000) (Torruella, J., concurring) (stating that \"Puerto Rico\n\nremains a colony with little prospect of exerting effective political\n\npressure on the elected branches of government to take corrective\n\naction\"); Schoon, 971 F.2d at 198 (asserting that legal alternatives\n\ncan never be exhausted when the harm could be mitigated through\n\ncongressional action). See generally Trailer Marine Transp.

As such, we need not address whether the\n\nalleged harm, if true, constitutes a \"greater evil\" than trespassing,\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fsee Maxwell, 254 F.3d at 27 (assuming, but not deciding, that\n\ndefendant's trespassory protest was a \"lesser evil\" than the harm posed\n\nby nuclear-armed submarines allegedly participating in Navy exercises\n\nin Vieques), or whether the alleged risks to health, life, and the\n\nenvironment, though cumulative over time, could qualify as \"imminent\"\n\nharm, see id. at 27 (defining \"imminent harm\" as a \"real emergency\"\n\ninvolving \"immediate danger\").\n\n\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\fC.   Discovery as to Use of Non-Conventional Weapons\n\n          All appellants, except Sued-Jiménez, collectively assert that\n\nthe district court erred in not permitting discovery on the\n\ngovernment's alleged use of non-conventional weapons in Vieques' Live\n\nImpact Area.2 Appellants seek evidence, if it exists, on the use of\n\nnon-conventional weapons to support their allegation that the Navy's\n\nactivities present an imminent health threat to Vieques' residents and\n\nare therefore a \"greater evil\" than trespassing. In other words,\n\nappellants requested discovery because it was relevant to the first and\n\nsecond elements of the necessity defense.\n\n          Given our affirmance of the district court's preclusion of\n\nthe necessity defense, any evidence relating to this defense that might\n\nbe obtained through discovery is irrelevant.3 Thus, government-held\n\nevidence relating to the alleged use of non-conventional weapons is not\n\nmaterial to the case and need not be disclosed to defendants. See Fed.\n\nR. Crim. P. 16(a)(1) (providing that government need only disclose\n\nevidence that is material to the defendant's defense). As a result, it\n\nwas not error for the district court to refuse to order the requested\n\ndiscovery.\n\n\n2 The Live Impact Area is the section of Camp García where the live-\nfire artillery and bombardment exercises occur.\n3 This is all the more true because appellants only seek discovery of\nevidence relevant to the first two prongs of the necessity defense, the\nmerits of which we have declined to address or rely upon in affirming\nthe district court's preclusion of the defense.\n\n                                 -19-\n\fD.   Speedy Trial Act Claim\n\n          Appellant Agosto-Hernández appeals her conviction on the\n\nadditional ground that it allegedly violates the Speedy Trial Act, 18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 3161-3174 (1994). A criminal complaint was filed against\n\nAgosto-Hernández on June 25, 2000, the same day she was arrested. An\n\ninformation was filed against her on June 29, 2000, and she was\n\narraigned on August 28, 2000. Appellant pled not guilty, and the\n\ngovernment moved to dismiss the criminal complaint that had previously\n\nbeen filed. At a status conference on December 13, 2000, appellant\n\nannounced that she would move for a dismissal based on the Speedy Trial\n\nAct. On December 20, 2000, she filed her motion to dismiss, alleging\n\nthat more than 70 days had elapsed between her plea of not guilty and\n\ntrial.   The district court denied the motion and appellant appeals.\n\n          The Speedy Trial Act provides that when a defendant pleads\n\nnot guilty to \"the commission of an offense,\" the trial must occur\n\nwithin seventy days from the date the information or indictment was\n\nfiled, or from the date the defendant appeared before the court where\n\nthe charge is pending, whichever is later. See 18 U.S.C. § 3161(c)(1).\n\nIf the Act is violated, the charges will be dismissed on defendant's\n\nmotion for failure to comply with this time table. See 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3162(a)(2).\n\n          The Speedy Trial Act, however, only applies to defendants\n\ncharged with an \"offense,\" which is defined as \"any Federal criminal\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\foffense which is in violation of any Act of Congress and is triable by\n\na court established by Act of Congress (other than a Class B or C\n\nmisdemeanor . . . ).\"    18 U.S.C. § 3172(2).    Thus, Class B and C\n\nmisdemeanors are explicitly excluded from the Act's coverage. The\n\ncriminal trespassing statute at issue here, 18 U.S.C. § 1382, is\n\nclassified as a Class B misdemeanor. See 18 U.S.C. § 1382 (authorizing\n\nup to six months' imprisonment); 18 U.S.C. § 3559(a)(7) (1994)\n\n(classifying a criminal offense with a maximum sentence of six months\n\nas a Class B misdemeanor); see also Sharpton, 252 F.3d at 540. As a\n\nresult, the Speedy Trial Act does not apply to the criminal charge\n\nagainst appellant.    See 18 U.S.C. § 3172(2) (excluding Class B\n\nmisdemeanors from Act's coverage); see also United States v.
