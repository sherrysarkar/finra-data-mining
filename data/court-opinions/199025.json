Paul J. Barbadoro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                        Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n                   Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                     and Boudin, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Nancy J. Smith, Assistant Attorney General, with whom Philip T.\nMcLaughlin, Attorney General, was on brief for appellant.\n\n     Michael J. Sheehan for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                           August 2, 2000\n\f2\n\f          BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge. The plaintiff-appellee, Sherri\n\nWhite, brought suit in the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of New Hampshire against the defendant-appellant, the New\n\nHampshire Department of Corrections (“DOC”), alleging violations of\n\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e-2000h-6,\n\nand state law claims of wrongful discharge and intentional infliction\n\nof emotional distress.1 Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that she\n\nwas the victim of direct sexual harassment, of a hostile work\n\nenvironment, and of retaliation after she complained of the harassment.\n\n\n\n          The defendant moved for summary judgment on the sexual\n\nharassment claim. The court (Barbadoro, J.) denied the motion and the\n\ncase proceeded to trial.    The defendant moved in limine to limit\n\nevidence to issues in the administrative complaint and the federal\n\ncomplaint. The district court denied this motion. At the close of the\n\nplaintiff's case, the defendant moved for judgment as a matter of law.\n\nThe district court took the motion under advisement. The court charged\n\nthe jury, and the defendant objected to part of the charge.\n\nDefendant's objection was overruled and the court submitted the case to\n\nthe jury. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff on all three\n\nclaims with an award of damages in the amount of $45,000.00.       The\n\n\n\n     1    Following an uncontested motion by the DOC, the district\ncourt dismissed the state law claims.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fdefendant renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law verbally\n\nwhen the verdict was returned and thereafter in writing. The district\n\ncourt denied the defendant's motions, and this appeal followed.\n\n             On appeal, the defendant presents essentially three issues\n\nfor review: (1) the plaintiff did not present sufficient evidence to\n\nsupport her claims of sexual harassment, hostile work environment,\n\nretaliation, and that the plaintiff had not proven that the defendant\n\nwas liable for the acts of its employees;2 (2) the district court erred\n\nin denying the defendant's motion in limine to exclude evidence; and\n\n(3) the district court improperly instructed the jury by misstating the\n\nlaw. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the district court in all\n\nrespects.\n\nI.   Facts\n\n             We briefly describe the facts here, but discuss them in\n\ngreater detail where applicable and necessary for our discussion. The\n\nplaintiff was hired as a corrections officer (“CO”) at the New\n\nHampshire State Prison in Concord, New Hampshire in January 1993. She\n\nwas qualified for the CO position and received positive evaluations in\n\nJanuary 1994 and 1995. In early 1995, the plaintiff became a “direct\n\nsupervision officer” (“DSO”) for the inmates housed in the Hancock Unit\n\n(“H-Building”). In May of 1995, the plaintiff became the DSO of “B\n\n\n\n     2    The plaintiff had sued only the DOC; she had not sued any of\nits employees individually.\n\n                                   -4-\n\fPod.” Shortly thereafter, tensions developed between some of the other\n\nemployees and the plaintiff. Some of these tensions were expressed in\n\nstatements of a sexual nature directed at the plaintiff.\n\n          The plaintiff filed a complaint with the Discrimination\n\nReview Committee (“DRC”) of the DOC on November 3, 1995 alleging sexual\n\nharassment.   She also filed a copy of her complaint with the New\n\nHampshire Human Rights Commission and the Equal Employment Opportunity\n\nCommission. The plaintiff's suit in the district court followed. The\n\nplaintiff alleged that, after she filed her administrative complaint,\n\nthe DOC and its employees retaliated against her.\n\nII.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n          The defendant argues before us that the district court erred\n\nwhen it denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment and motions\n\nfor judgment as a matter of law. The DOC claims that the plaintiff did\n\nnot provide sufficient evidence to prove the plaintiff's allegations.\n\n          Even assuming that the decision is reviewable on this appeal\n\n- a matter on which we take no view - there is no point in discussing\n\nthe court's ruling on the summary judgment motion separately from our\n\ntreatment of the denial of the defendant's motions for judgment as a\n\nmatter of law. This is because we find that the evidence supports the\n\njudge's denial of the motions for judgment as a matter of law3 and this\n\n      3   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a) governs motions for\njudgment as a matter of law:\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\famounts to an affirmance of the court's denial of the summary judgment\n\nmotion.\n\n            We review the court's denial of defendant's motions for\n\njudgment as a matter of law de novo, but examine the evidence and\n\ninferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. See\n\nFoster-Miller, Inc. v. Babcock & Wilcox Canada, 210 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).    We may reverse only if a reasonable person could not have\n\nreached the conclusion of the jury. See Negron-Rivera v. Rivera-\n\nClaudio, 204 F.3d 287, 289-90 (1st Cir. 2000). In conducting our de\n\nnovo review, we “may not consider the credibility of witnesses, resolve\n\nconflicts in testimony, or evaluate the weight of the evidence.\" Katz\n\nv. City Metal Co., 87 F.3d 26, 28 (1st Cir. 1996) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). The Supreme Court has stated that when “entertaining\n\na motion for judgment as a matter of law, the court should review all\n\nof the evidence in the record. In doing so, however, the court must\n\ndraw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, and it\n\nmay not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence.” Reeves\n\n\n\n                 (1) If during a trial by jury a party has\n            been fully heard on an issue and there is no\n            legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a\n            reasonable jury to find for that party on that\n            issue, the court may determine the issue against\n            that party and may grant a motion for judgment as\n            a matter of law against that party with respect\n            to a claim or defense that cannot under the\n            controlling law be maintained or defeated without\n            a favorable finding on that issue.\n\n                                  -6-\n\fv. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc.,      U.S. , 120 S. Ct. 2097, 2110\n\n(2000).\n\n           Once a jury renders a verdict, a “heavy burden” is placed on\n\none who challenges it. See United States v. Scharon, 187 F.3d 17, 20\n\n(1st Cir. 1999) (citations omitted).       We stated that:\n\n           One who challenges the sufficiency of the\n           evidence bears a heavy burden: he must show that\n           no rational jury could have found him guilty\n           beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . We review the\n           sufficiency of the evidence as a whole, in a\n           light most favorable to the verdict, taking into\n           consideration all reasonable inferences. . . . We\n           resolve all credibility issues in favor of the\n           verdict. . . . The evidence may be entirely\n           circumstantial, and need not exclude every\n           hypothesis of innocence; that is, the factfinder\n           may decide among reasonable interpretations of\n           the evidence.\n\nId.\n\n           Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it “an\n\nunlawful employment practice for an employer . . . to discriminate\n\nagainst any individual with respect to his compensation, terms,\n\nconditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's\n\nrace, color, religion, sex, or national origin.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n\n2(a)(1).   The Supreme Court has stated that,\n\n           this language is not limited to 'economic' or\n           'tangible' discrimination. The phrase 'terms,\n           conditions, or privileges of employment' evinces\n           a congressional intent to strike at the entire\n           spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women\n           in employment, which includes requiring people to\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f          work in a discriminatorily hostile or abusive\n          environment.\n\nHarris v. Forklift Sys., 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993) (some internal\n\nquotation marks omitted); see also Meritor Sav. Bank v. Vinson, 477\n\nU.S. 57, 64 (1986); Los Angeles Dep't of Water and Power v. Manhart,\n\n435 U.S. 702, 707 n.13 (1978).\n\n          “When the workplace is permeated with discriminatory\n\nintimidation, ridicule, and insult that is sufficiently severe or\n\npervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create\n\nan abusive working environment, Title VII is violated.” Oncale v.\n\nSundowner Offshore Servs., 523 U.S. 75, 78 (1998) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted) (quoting Harris, 510 U.S. at 21). The Supreme Court\n\ndirects us to “determine whether an environment is sufficiently hostile\n\nor abusive by looking at all the circumstances, including the frequency\n\nof the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically\n\nthreatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether\n\nit unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance.”\n\nFaragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 778 (1998) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted); Harris, 510 U.S. at 23.\n\n          After careful review of the entire record, we hold that the\n\nfacts adduced were sufficient for the jury verdict. We review the\n\nevidence on sexual harassment and a hostile work environment.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f          The plaintiff pointed to numerous comments made by other\n\nemployees either to or about her which were “sufficiently severe or\n\npervasive to alter the conditions of [her] employment and create an\n\nabusive working environment.” Oncale, 523 U.S. at 78. The record\n\nreflects that Officer Colby (a male employee at the DOC who held the\n\nsame position as the plaintiff) wanted to “keep an eye” on the\n\nplaintiff because he believed she was having a sexual affair with\n\ninmate York. Officer Colby told other employees: “I think she's in\n\nthere blowing him and screwing him.”4 Officer Colby referred to the\n\nplaintiff as “Mrs. York.” Inmates also referred to the plaintiff as\n\n“Mrs. York” because of the conversations they either heard or had with\n\nother prison employees.\n\n          The plaintiff also evinced that sexual conversations and\n\njokes were common at the DOC. The male employees graphically spoke of\n\ntheir evenings at clubs and bars, read pornographic magazines at work,\n\ndiscussed the size of mens' penises and stared at women's breasts. Two\n\nmale employees openly discussed their experiences with Prozac and how\n\nit affected their sex lives. A sergeant stated: “Oh, yeah, it will go\n\nup but it won't go down.” A corporal explained that he had trouble\n\ngetting an erection, and said to the plaintiff: “Sherri, I'd have to\n\ntip you upside down and dunk you like a tea bag.” Plaintiff alleged\n\nthat another employee said to her: “Gee, [the corporal] owed me a blow\n\n     4    There is no evidence in the record to support this statement.\n\n                                 -9-\n\fjob for today, but seeing as though he's not here, you want to take\n\ncare of that for me?” The plaintiff testified that the “disgusting\n\ncomments,” conversations and treatment of her were “continuing,”\n\n“consistent” and occurred “everyday.”\n\n          There was also evidence that the plaintiff was subjected to\n\ndisparate treatment because she was a woman.        For example, the\n\nplaintiff was told by her supervisor not to enter the supply room with\n\nan inmate because she was a woman and something could happen to her.\n\nThe supply room was frequently used by employees as a place where\n\nprison guards could speak privately with inmates. The supervisor\n\nclaimed that he feared that the plaintiff would be hurt because she is\n\n“a very pretty lady and we work in a hostile situation.” The record\n\nreflects, however, that male guards had been hurt when they accompanied\n\nan inmate into a supply room, yet no male guard was given the same\n\nwarning as the plaintiff and no male employee was prohibited from\n\naccompanying an inmate into the supply room.\n\n          Another example of disparate treatment was when an employee\n\nof DOC asked the inmates living on the plaintiff's pod how they felt\n\nabout a woman running their pod. The male employees of the DOC often\n\ncommented that they would not allow their wives to work in the prison,\n\nand told the plaintiff that if she were their wife, they would not want\n\nher working there.    Nothing like that was said to any male employee.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f          It must also be noted that the DOC's own internal\n\ninvestigation found that “the work environment became intimidating and\n\nhostile for [the plaintiff] caused by inappropriate behavior by fellow\n\nworkers and unprofessionalism of supervisors.” The investigators\n\nfurther found that “the sexual remarks and innuendos that were made\n\nconcerning [the plaintiff] and an inmate[] made this a sexual\n\nharassment case.” The investigation concluded that “the fact that the\n\nchain of command broke down . . . the perceived favoritism of [the\n\nplaintiff] by fellow officers and the sexual remarks and innuendos\n\nmade, created an intimidating and hostile work environment.”\n\n          The plaintiff provided more than sufficient evidence to\n\nsupport a claim for hostile work environment.           The evidence\n\ndemonstrates that her workplace was “permeated with discriminatory\n\nintimidation, ridicule and insult that [was] sufficiently severe or\n\npervasive to alter the conditions of [her] employment and create an\n\nabusive working environment.” Oncale, 523 U.S. at 78; Harris, 510 U.S.\n\nat 21 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).\n\n          We have stated that “[o]verriding a jury verdict is warranted\n\nonly if the evidence 'is so one-sided that the movant is plainly\n\nentitled to judgment, for reasonable minds could not differ as to the\n\noutcome. '” Colasanto v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am., 100 F.3d 203, 208\n\n(1st Cir. 1996) (quoting Gibson v. City of Cranston, 37 F.3d 731, 735\n\n(1st Cir. 1994)). No such evidence exists in this case and we affirm\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fthe district court's denial of the defendant's motions for judgment as\n\na matter of law on this ground.\n\n          We also hold that there is ample evidence in the record to\n\nsupport the plaintiff's claim of employer liability. Proving employer\n\nliability depends in the first instance upon whether the alleged\n\nharassment is caused by a co-employee of the victim or a supervisor.\n\nIf the harassment is caused by a co-employee, the employer is liable if\n\nit “knew or should have known of the charged sexual harassment and\n\nfailed to implement prompt and appropriate corrective action.”\n\nBlanketship v. Parke Care Ctrs., Inc., 123 F.3d 868, 872 (6th Cir.\n\n1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).       If the offender is a\n\nsupervisor, the employer is liable unless it proves the affirmative\n\ndefense “that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and\n\ncorrect promptly any sexually harassing behavior, and . . . that the\n\nplaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any\n\npreventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to\n\navoid harm otherwise.” Faragher, 524 U.S. at 807.       Review of the\n\nrecord reveals ample evidence for the jury to find the DOC liable for\n\nthe conduct of its employees—both supervisors and co-employees. The\n\nplaintiff showed that the DOC was aware of the charged sexual\n\nharassment because the plaintiff complained to her supervisors and\n\nsubsequently filed a complaint with the Discrimination Review Committee\n\nof the DOC. The plaintiff presented evidence from which it could be\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\ffound that the DOC did not handle the internal investigation properly\n\nor timely, and that the DOC allowed the conduct and comments to\n\ncontinue. Therefore, it was appropriate for the district court to deny\n\nthe defendant's motion for judgment as a matter of law and allow the\n\njury to determine that the DOC was liable for the conduct of\n\nplaintiff's co-employees.\n\n          The evidence in the record also supports the claim that the\n\nDOC was liable for the conduct of its supervisors because it shows that\n\nthe DOC failed to prove that it “exercised reasonable care to prevent\n\nand correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior.” Faragher, 524\n\nU.S. at 778. In addition, the plaintiff “[took] advantage of any\n\npreventative or corrective opportunities provided by the employer,”\n\nid., by filing her complaint with the DOC's internal investigatory\n\ncommittee. The record contains evidence from which the jury could have\n\nconcluded that the DOC did not handle the internal investigation\n\nproperly or timely, and that the DOC allowed the conduct and comments\n\nto continue.\n\n          The DOC further argues that the plaintiff failed to establish\n\na prima facie case of retaliation. To establish a prima facie case of\n\nretaliation, a plaintiff must prove that “(1) [s]he engaged in\n\nprotected conduct under Title VII; (2) [s]he suffered an adverse\n\nemployment action; and (3) the adverse action is casually connected to\n\nthe protected activity.” Hernandez-Torres v. Intercontinental Trading,\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fInc., 158 F.3d 43, 47 (1st Cir. 1998). Review of the record indicates\n\nthat the plaintiff did establish a prima facie case of retaliation.\n\n          The evidence adduced by the plaintiff was as follows: The\n\nplaintiff engaged in protected activity by filing her internal and EEOC\n\ncomplaints. See Hernandez-Torres, 158 F.3d at 47. The plaintiff\n\npresented ample evidence for a jury to find that she suffered adverse\n\nemployment actions subsequent to the filing of her complaint. Adverse\n\nemployment actions include “demotions, disadvantageous transfers or\n\nassignments, refusals to promote, unwarranted negative job evaluations,\n\nand toleration of harassment by other employees.” Id. The plaintiff\n\nintroduced evidence that other employees continued to harass her after\n\nshe filed her complaint; that she was transferred out of her unit\n\nwithout her consent and not reassigned, but left to find another unit;\n\nand ultimately constructively discharged.       There was sufficient\n\nevidence for a jury to find that the plaintiff suffered adverse\n\nemployment action because she filed a complaint.\n\nIII. Motion In Limine\n\n          Prior to trial, the defendant moved in limine “to limit the\n\nevidence and testimony . . . to the issues raised by Plaintiff's\n\ninternal sexual harassment complaint of November 3, 1995 and her claims\n\nof subsequent retaliation.”     The defendant argued that “allowing\n\ntestimony concerning issues of which Plaintiff did not complain would\n\nnot be relevant.”\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\f          The evidence in question was first brought up during the\n\nplaintiff's deposition.     She claimed there were acts of sexual\n\nharassment which took place prior to the filing of the plaintiff's\n\nadministrative complaint. The evidence included allegations that\n\nCorporal Brochu read pornography in the office; that Brochu, Hart and\n\nBell used foul language and/or made sexual jokes or comments in her\n\npresence that she found offensive; and allegations about various other\n\nemployees who were not specifically named in her administrative\n\ncomplaint.\n\n          The district court, ruling from the bench, denied the motion.\n\nThe defendant argues that it was “an abuse of discretion to allow this\n\nevidence as [plaintiff] failed to exhaust administrative remedies\n\nregarding these allegations and there could be no relevance as the acts\n\nwere     not      the      subject      of      her     complaint.”\n\n          We review the district court's denial of the motion in limine\n\nfor abuse of discretion. See JOM, Inc. v. Adell Plastics, Inc., 193\n\nF.3d 47, 50 (1st Cir. 1999); see also United States v. Lozada-Rivera,\n\n177 F.3d 98, 103 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          The district court determined that though the evidence in\n\nquestion was not specifically articulated in the administrative\n\ncomplaint, it was relevant to the claims set forth therein. The court\n\ndenied the motion and instructed the defendant that it could later\n\nargue to the jury that “those matters should not be considered because\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\f[the DOC was not] negligent in failing to stop them because [the DOC]\n\ndidn't know about them because the plaintiff never brought them to\n\n[its] attention and the jury will have to find out whether there was\n\nnegligence or not.”\n\n          We hold that the evidence is relevant. “'Relevant evidence'\n\nmeans evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact\n\nthat is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable\n\nor less probable than it would be without the evidence.” Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 401.   The deposition evidence was directly related to the\n\nplaintiff's claim that she worked in a sexually hostile environment.\n\n          The defendant also contends that the district court abused\n\nits discretion when it denied the motion in limine to exclude evidence\n\nbecause the plaintiff “failed to exhaust administrative remedies\n\nregarding [those] allegations.” The plaintiff argues that we need not\n\nconsider this exhaustion argument because the defendant waived it when\n\nit failed to articulate it to the district court. Our reading of the\n\nrecord does not convince us that the defendant waived this contention;\n\nwe therefore decide it on the merits.\n\n          We have held that the administrative charge “affords formal\n\nnotice to the employer and prospective defendant of the charges that\n\nhave been made against it,” Powers v. Grinnell Corp., 915 F.2d 34, 37\n\n(1st Cir. 1990) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted), and\n\n“[t]he scope of the civil complaint is accordingly limited to the\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\fcharge filed with the EEOC and the investigation which can reasonably\n\nbe expected to grow out of that charge.” Id.; see also Lattimore v.\n\nPolaroid Corp., 99 F.3d 456, 464 (1st Cir. 1996). We have also stated\n\nthat\n\n            [a]n administrative charge is not a blueprint for\n            the litigation to follow. . . . [and] the exact\n            wording of the charge of discrimination need not\n            presage with literary exactitude the judicial\n            pleadings which may follow. . . . Rather, the\n            critical question is whether the claims set forth\n            in the civil complaint come within the scope of\n            the EEOC investigation which can reasonably be\n            expected to grow out of the charge of\n            discrimination.\n\nPowers, 915 F.2d at 38 (internal citations and quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n            Here, the plaintiff filed her administrative complaint with\n\nthe New Hampshire Human Rights Commission and the EEOC, claiming that\n\nshe was discriminated against on the basis of her gender, subjected to\n\na hostile work environment and retaliated against after reporting the\n\nalleged sexual harassment.     In her administrative complaint, the\n\nplaintiff gives ten examples of the alleged discrimination in a\n\n“partial list” (emphasis added), consisting of almost two pages.\n\nThough the administrative complaint does not spell out all of the\n\nspecific comments made by various employees, it was sufficient to\n\ndescribe the essential nature of the charge and to lead to a reasonable\n\ninvestigation thereof. As such, the evidence that the defendant wished\n\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\fto exclude fell within the scope of the administrative complaint and\n\nthe plaintiff was entitled to bring it before the district court. See\n\nPowers, 915 F.2d at 38.      The district court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion when it denied the DOC's motion in limine and allowed the\n\nevidence to be introduced at trial.\n\nIV.   Jury Instruction\n\n           The DOC argues that “the jury instruction regarding\n\nretaliation was inadequate and is likely to have misled or confused the\n\njury regarding the applicable law.” It contends that the court erred\n\nwhen it “refused” to “instruct the jury that the plaintiff was required\n\nto prove that the [defendant's] given reasons [for discharging the\n\nplaintiff] were a pretext and that the real reason was retaliatory\n\nintent.”   The DOC claims that the jury instruction, as charged,\n\nviolates the precepts of the burden-shifting scheme, articulated by the\n\nSupreme Court in McDonnell Douglas v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), and\n\nconstitutes reversible error.\n\n           The standard of review for preserved challenges to jury\n\ninstructions is well-settled:\n\n           The standard of review is ironclad: The trial\n           court's refusal to give a particular instruction\n           constitutes reversible error only if the\n           requested instruction was (1) correct as a matter\n           of substantive law, (2) not substantially\n           incorporated into the charge as rendered, and (3)\n           integral to an important point in the case.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\fUnited States v. DeStefano, 59 F.3d 1, 2 (1995) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).\n\n          The district court instructed the jury regarding the\n\nretaliation claim as follows:\n\n                 To prove a retaliation claim under Title\n          VII the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance\n          of the evidence that:\n\n                 (1) plaintiff filed a sexual harassment\n          complaint with her employer,\n\n                 (2) after the plaintiff filed her sexual\n          harassment complaint she was subjected to an\n          adverse employment action by her employer, and\n\n                 (3) that the employer took the adverse\n          employment action because she had filed a sexual\n          harassment complaint.\n\n                 Adverse employment actions may include\n          actions by the employer amounting to a\n          constructive discharge, the preparation of an\n          unwarranted negative employment evaluation, an\n          unwarranted disadvantageous transfer, or\n          toleration of harassment by employees.\n\n                 Plaintiff does not have to prove that her\n          sexual harassment claim has merit in order to\n          prove her retaliation claim.\n\nThe defendant requested a more explicit explanation of the McDonnell\n\nDouglas burden-shifting scheme. The DOC argues that, in addition to\n\nthe charge given, the jury should have been instructed explicitly as to\n\nthe shifting burdens and upon which party's shoulders they fell.\n\nSpecifically, the DOC objects to the absence of language in the\n\ndistrict court's instruction pertaining to the plaintiff's burden to\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fshow that the reason for termination proffered by the DOC was\n\npretextual.5\n\n           We need not recount the intricacies of the McDonnell Douglas\n\ntest here. The essence of McDonnell Douglas is a tripartite regimen.\n\nThe plaintiff must first prove the prima facie case for retaliatory\n\ndischarge. See Texas Dep’t of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S.\n\n248, 253 (1981). Thereafter, the defendant must rebut the presumption\n\ncreated   by   the   prima   facie   case   by   producing   a   legitimate\n\nnondiscriminatory reason for the employer's action. See McDonnell\n\nDouglas, 411 U.S. at 802. Once the defendant meets this burden, \"the\n\ntrier of fact proceeds to the ultimate question: whether plaintiff has\n\nproved that the defendant intentionally discriminated against [the\n\nplaintiff]” on the basis of the plaintiff's protected characteristic or\n\naction. St. Mary’s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 510 (1993). The\n\nplaintiff must \"be given a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate by\n\ncompetent evidence that the presumptively valid reasons for his\n\nrejection were in fact a cover-up for a . . . discriminatory decision.\"\n\nMcDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 805.\n\n           The district court's jury instruction admittedly does not\n\nfollow the exact regimen of McDonnell Douglas. It need not do so,\n\n     5    The plaintiff argues that the DOC did not properly object to\nthis portion of the charge, and therefore, it was not properly\npreserved for our consideration. Our reading of the transcript,\nhowever, reveals otherwise and we will consider the argument on the\nmerits.\n\n                                     -20-\n\fhowever, to be sufficient. See Loeb v. Textron, Inc., 600 F.2d 1003,\n\n1016 (1st Cir. 1979) (“McDonnell Douglas was not written as a\n\nprospective jury charge; to read its technical aspects to a jury . . .\n\nwill add little to a juror's understanding of the case.”). What is\n\nimportant is that the instructions “identify the important factual\n\nissues,” id., for the jury to resolve.\n\n          The chief complaint of the defendant here is that the jury\n\nwas not told that it had to find pretext, and that the burden of\n\nshowing pretext lay with the plaintiff. While we agree that this is an\n\n“important factual issue,” we think that it was sufficiently presented\n\nto the jury. As we stated in Loeb: “The central issue, which the court\n\nmust put directly to the jury, is whether or not plaintiff was\n\ndischarged 'because of [protected conduct]'” Id. at 1017. Undoubtedly,\n\nthe court put this issue to the jury. The court's instruction made\n\nclear to the jury that, in order to find for the plaintiff, it had to\n\nfind “that the employer took the adverse employment action because she\n\nhad filed a sexual harassment complaint.” (emphasis added). This\n\nsubstantially incorporated into the charge exactly what the defendant\n\nwished.\n\n          We refuse to impose upon district courts a rigidly formalist\n\nview of McDonnell Douglas' requirements. As we stated in Loeb, “The\n\nSupreme Court has made it abundantly clear that McDonnell Douglas was\n\nintended to be neither 'rigid, mechanized, or ritualistic' nor the\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\fexclusive method for proving a claim of discrimination.” Loeb, 600\n\nF.2d at 1017 (internal citation omitted). To adopt the defendants'\n\nview would be to impose just such a “rigid, mechanized, [and]\n\nritualistic” requirement on the district courts.\n\nV.   Conclusion\n\n          For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the district\n\ncourt.   Costs awarded to appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                               -22-\n\f",

The court (Barbadoro, J.) denied the motion and the case proceeded to trial. The defendant moved in limine to limit evidence to issues in the administrative complaint and the federal complaint. The district court denied this motion. At the close of the plaintiff's case, the defendant moved for judgment as a matter of law. The district court took the motion under advisement. The court charged the jury, and the defendant objected to part of the charge. Defendant's objection was overruled and the court submitted the case to the jury. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff on all three claims with an award of damages in the amount of $45,000.00. The defendant renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law verbally when the verdict was returned and thereafter in writing. The district court denied the defendant's motions, and this appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the defendant presents essentially three issues for review: (1) the plaintiff did not present sufficient evidence to support her claims of sexual harassment, hostile work environment, retaliation, and that the plaintiff had not proven that the defendant was liable for the acts of its employees;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> (2) the district court erred in denying the defendant's motion in limine to exclude evidence; and (3) the district court improperly instructed the jury by misstating the law. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the district court in all respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We briefly describe the facts here, but discuss them in greater detail where applicable and necessary for our discussion. The plaintiff was hired as a corrections officer (\"CO\") at the New Hampshire State Prison in Concord, New Hampshire in January 1993. She was qualified for the CO position and received positive evaluations in January 1994 and 1995. In early 1995, the plaintiff became a \"direct supervision officer\" (\"DSO\") for the inmates housed in the Hancock Unit (\"H-Building\"). In May of 1995, the plaintiff became the DSO of \"B Pod.\" Shortly thereafter, tensions developed between some of the other employees and the plaintiff. Some of these tensions were expressed in statements of a sexual nature directed at the plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff filed a complaint with the Discrimination Review Committee (\"DRC\") of the DOC on November 3, 1995 alleging sexual harassment. She also filed a copy of her complaint with the New Hampshire Human Rights Commission and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The plaintiff's suit in the district court followed. The plaintiff alleged that, after she filed her administrative complaint, the DOC and its employees retaliated against her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant argues before us that the district court erred when it denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment and motions for judgment as a matter of law. The DOC claims that the plaintiff did not provide sufficient evidence to prove the plaintiff's allegations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming that the decision is reviewable on this appeal -a matter on which we take no view - there is no point in discussing the court's ruling on the summary judgment motion separately from our treatment of the denial of the defendant's motions for judgment as a matter of law. This is because we find that the evidence supports the judge's denial of the motions for judgment as a matter of law<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and this amounts to an affirmance of the court's denial of the summary judgment motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the court's denial of defendant's motions for judgment as a matter of law de novo, but examine the evidence and inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. See Foster-Miller, Inc. v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Canada, 210 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2000). We may reverse only if a reasonable person could not have reached the conclusion of the jury. See Negron-Rivera v. Rivera-Claudio, 204 F.3d 287, 289-90 (1st Cir. 2000). In conducting our de novo review, we \"may not consider the credibility of witnesses, resolve conflicts in testimony, or evaluate the weight of the evidence.\" Katz v. City Metal Co., 87 F.3d 26, 28 (1st Cir. 1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Supreme Court has stated that when \"entertaining a motion for judgment as a matter of law, the court should review all of the evidence in the record. In doing so, however, the court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, and it may not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence.\" Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., U.S., 120 S. Ct. 2097, 2110 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once a jury renders a verdict, a \"heavy burden\" is placed on one who challenges it. See United States v. Scharon, 187 F.3d 17, 20 (1st Cir. 1999) (citations omitted). We stated that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One who challenges the sufficiency of the evidence bears a heavy burden: he must show that no rational jury could have found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.... We review the sufficiency of the evidence as a whole, in a light most favorable to the verdict, taking into consideration all reasonable inferences.... We resolve all credibility issues in favor of the verdict.... The evidence may be entirely circumstantial, and need not exclude every hypothesis of innocence; that is, the factfinder may decide among reasonable interpretations of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it \"an unlawful employment practice for an employer... to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-2(a)(1). The Supreme Court has stated that,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">this language is not limited to 'economic' or 'tangible' discrimination. The phrase 'terms, conditions, or privileges of employment' evinces a congressional intent to strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women in employment, which includes requiring people to work in a discriminatorily hostile or abusive environment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Harris v.

Sundowner Offshore Servs., 523 U.S. 75, 78 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Harris, 510 U.S. at 21). The Supreme Court directs us to \"determine whether an environment is sufficiently hostile or abusive by looking at all the circumstances, including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance.\" Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 778 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted); Harris, 510 U.S. at 23.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After careful review of the entire record, we hold that the facts adduced were sufficient for the jury verdict. We review the evidence on sexual harassment and a hostile work environment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff pointed to numerous comments made by other employees either to or about her which were \"sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of [her] employment and create an abusive working environment.\" Oncale, 523 U.S. at 78. The record reflects that Officer Colby (a male employee at the DOC who held the same position as the plaintiff) wanted to \"keep an eye\" on the plaintiff because he believed she was having a sexual affair with inmate York. Officer Colby told other employees: \"I think she's in there blowing him and screwing him.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Officer Colby referred to the plaintiff as \"Mrs. York.\" Inmates also referred to the plaintiff as \"Mrs. York\" because of the conversations they either heard or had with other prison employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff also evinced that sexual conversations and jokes were common at the DOC. The male employees graphically spoke of their evenings at clubs and bars, read pornographic magazines at work, discussed the size of mens' penises and stared at women's breasts. Two male employees openly discussed their experiences with Prozac and how it affected their sex lives. A sergeant stated: \"Oh, yeah, it will go up but it won't go down.\" A corporal explained that he had trouble getting an erection, and said to the plaintiff: \"Sherri, I'd have to tip you upside down and dunk you like a tea bag.\" Plaintiff alleged that another employee said to her: \"Gee, [the corporal] owed me a blow job for today, but seeing as though he's not here, you want to take care of that for me?\" The plaintiff testified that the \"disgusting comments,\" conversations and treatment of her were \"continuing,\" \"consistent\" and occurred \"everyday.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was also evidence that the plaintiff was subjected to disparate treatment because she was a woman. For example, the plaintiff was told by her supervisor not to enter the supply room with an inmate because she was a woman and something could happen to her. The supply room was frequently used by employees as a place where prison guards could speak privately with inmates. The supervisor claimed that he feared that the plaintiff would be hurt because she is \"a very pretty lady and we work in a hostile situation.\" The record reflects, however, that male guards had been hurt when they accompanied an inmate into a supply room, yet no male guard was given the same warning as the plaintiff and no male employee was prohibited from accompanying an inmate into the supply room.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another example of disparate treatment was when an employee of DOC asked the inmates living on the plaintiff's pod how they felt about a woman running their pod. The male employees of the DOC often commented that they would not allow their wives to work in the prison, and told the plaintiff that if she were their wife, they would not want her working there. Nothing like that was said to any male employee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It must also be noted that the DOC's own internal investigation found that \"the work environment became intimidating and hostile for [the plaintiff] caused by inappropriate behavior by fellow workers and unprofessionalism of supervisors.\" The investigators further found that \"the sexual remarks and innuendoes that were made concerning [the plaintiff] and an inmate[] made this a sexual harassment case.\" The investigation concluded that \"the fact that the chain of command broke down... the perceived favoritism of [the plaintiff] by fellow officers and the sexual remarks and innuendoes made, created an intimidating and hostile work environment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff provided more than sufficient evidence to support a claim for hostile work environment. The evidence demonstrates that her workplace was \"permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule and insult that [was] sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of [her] employment and create an abusive working environment.\" Oncale, 523 U.S. at 78; Harris, 510 U.S. at 21 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have stated that \"[o]verriding a jury verdict is warranted only if the evidence 'is so one-sided that the movant is plainly entitled to judgment, for reasonable minds could not differ as to the outcome. '\" Colasanto v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am., 100 F.3d 203, 208 (1st Cir. 1996) (quoting Gibson v. City of Cranston, 37 F.3d 731, 735 (1st Cir. 1994)). No such evidence exists in this case and we affirm the district court's denial of the defendant's motions for judgment as a matter of law on this ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also hold that there is ample evidence in the record to support the plaintiff's claim of employer liability. Proving employer liability depends in the first instance upon whether the alleged harassment is caused by a co-employee of the victim or a supervisor. If the harassment is caused by a co-employee, the employer is liable if it \"knew or should have known of the charged sexual harassment and failed to implement prompt and appropriate corrective action.\" Blanketship v. Parke Care Ctrs., Inc., 123 F.3d 868, 872 (6th Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). If the offender is a supervisor, the employer is liable unless it proves the affirmative defense \"that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior, and... that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.\" Faragher, 524 U.S. at 807. Review of the record reveals ample evidence for the jury to find the DOC liable for the conduct of its employees-both supervisors and co-employees. The plaintiff showed that the DOC was aware of the charged sexual harassment because the plaintiff complained to her supervisors and subsequently filed a complaint with the Discrimination Review Committee of the DOC. The plaintiff presented evidence from which it could be found that the DOC did not handle the internal investigation properly or timely, and that the DOC allowed the conduct and comments to continue. Therefore, it was appropriate for the district court to deny the defendant's motion for judgment as a matter of law and allow the jury to determine that the DOC was liable for the conduct of plaintiff's co-employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence in the record also supports the claim that the DOC was liable for the conduct of its supervisors because it shows that the DOC failed to prove that it \"exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior.\" Faragher, 524 U.S. at 778. In addition, the plaintiff \"[took] advantage of any preventative or corrective opportunities provided by the employer,\" id., by filing her complaint with the DOC's internal investigatory committee. The record contains evidence from which the jury could have concluded that the DOC did not handle the internal investigation properly or timely, and that the DOC allowed the conduct and comments to continue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The DOC further argues that the plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation. To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must prove that \"(1) [s]he engaged in protected conduct under Title VII; (2) [s]he suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) the adverse action is casually connected to the protected activity.\" Hernandez-Torres v. Intercontinental Trading, Inc., 158 F.3d 43, 47 (1st Cir. 1998). Review of the record indicates that the plaintiff did establish a prima facie case of retaliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence adduced by the plaintiff was as follows: The plaintiff engaged in protected activity by filing her internal and EEOC complaints. See Hernandez-Torres, 158 F.3d at 47. The plaintiff presented ample evidence for a jury to find that she suffered adverse employment actions subsequent to the filing of her complaint. Adverse employment actions include \"demotions, disadvantageous transfers or assignments, refusals to promote, unwarranted negative job evaluations, and toleration of harassment by other employees.\" Id. The plaintiff introduced evidence that other employees continued to harass her after she filed her complaint; that she was transferred out of her unit without her consent and not reassigned, but left to find another unit; and ultimately constructively discharged. There was sufficient evidence for a jury to find that the plaintiff suffered adverse employment action because she filed a complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. Motion In Limine</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to trial, the defendant moved in limine \"to limit the evidence and testimony... to the issues raised by Plaintiff's internal sexual harassment complaint of November 3, 1995 and her claims of subsequent retaliation.\" The defendant argued that \"allowing testimony concerning issues of which Plaintiff did not complain would not be relevant.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence in question was first brought up during the plaintiff's deposition. She claimed there were acts of sexual harassment which took place prior to the filing of the plaintiff's administrative complaint. The evidence included allegations that Corporal Brochu read pornography in the office; that Brochu, Hart and Bell used foul language and/or made sexual jokes or comments in her presence that she found offensive; and allegations about various other employees who were not specifically named in her administrative complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, ruling from the bench, denied the motion. The defendant argues that it was \"an abuse of discretion to allow this evidence as [plaintiff] failed to exhaust administrative remedies regarding these allegations and there could be no relevance as the acts were not the subject of her complaint.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's denial of the motion in limine for abuse of discretion. See JOM, Inc. v. Adell Plastics, Inc., 193 F.3d 47, 50 (1st Cir. 1999); see also United States v. Lozada-Rivera, 177 F.3d 98, 103 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court determined that though the evidence in question was not specifically articulated in the administrative complaint, it was relevant to the claims set forth therein. The court denied the motion and instructed the defendant that it could later argue to the jury that \"those matters should not be considered because [the DOC was not] negligent in failing to stop them because [the DOC] didn't know about them because the plaintiff never brought them to [its] attention and the jury will have to find out whether there was negligence or not.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that the evidence is relevant. \"'Relevant evidence' means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 401.The deposition evidence was directly related to the plaintiff's claim that she worked in a sexually hostile environment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant also contends that the district court abused its discretion when it denied the motion in limine to exclude evidence because the plaintiff \"failed to exhaust administrative remedies regarding [those] allegations.\" The plaintiff argues that we need not consider this exhaustion argument because the defendant waived it when it failed to articulate it to the district court. Our reading of the record does not convince us that the defendant waived this contention; we therefore decide it on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have held that the administrative charge \"affords formal notice to the employer and prospective defendant of the charges that have been made against it,\" Powers v. Grinnell Corp., 915 F.2d 34, 37 (1st Cir. 1990) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted), and \"[t]he scope of the civil complaint is accordingly limited to the charge filed with the EEOC and the investigation which can reasonably be expected to grow out of that charge.\" Id.; see also Lattimore v. Polaroid Corp., 99 F.3d 456, 464 (1st Cir. 1996). We have also stated that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[a]n administrative charge is not a blueprint for the litigation to follow.... [and] the exact wording of the charge of discrimination need not presage with literary exactitude the judicial pleadings which may follow.... Rather, the critical question is whether the claims set forth in the civil complaint come within the scope of the EEOC investigation which can reasonably be expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Powers, 915 F.2d at 38 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the plaintiff filed her administrative complaint with the New Hampshire Human Rights Commission and the EEOC, claiming that she was discriminated against on the basis of her gender, subjected to a hostile work environment and retaliated against after reporting the alleged sexual harassment. In her administrative complaint, the plaintiff gives ten examples of the alleged discrimination in a \"partial list\" (emphasis added), consisting of almost two pages. Though the administrative complaint does not spell out all of the specific comments made by various employees, it was sufficient to describe the essential nature of the charge and to lead to a reasonable investigation thereof. As such, the evidence that the defendant wished to exclude fell within the scope of the administrative complaint and the plaintiff was entitled to bring it before the district court. See Powers, 915 F.2d at 38. The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the DOC's motion in limine and allowed the evidence to be introduced at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. Jury Instruction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The DOC argues that \"the jury instruction regarding retaliation was inadequate and is likely to have misled or confused the jury regarding the applicable law.\" It contends that the court erred when it \"refused\" to \"instruct the jury that the plaintiff was required to prove that the [defendant's] given reasons [for discharging the plaintiff] were a pretext and that the real reason was retaliatory intent.\" The DOC claims that the jury instruction, as charged, violates the precepts of the burden-shifting scheme, articulated by the Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), and constitutes reversible error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard of review for preserved challenges to jury instructions is well-settled:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard of review is ironclad: The trial court's refusal to give a particular instruction constitutes reversible error only if the requested instruction was (1) correct as a matter of substantive law, (2) not substantially incorporated into the charge as rendered, and (3) integral to an important point in the case. United States v. DeStefano, 59 F.3d 1, 2 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court instructed the jury regarding the retaliation claim as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prove a retaliation claim under Title VII the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) plaintiff filed a sexual harassment complaint with her employer,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) after the plaintiff filed her sexual harassment complaint she was subjected to an adverse employment action by her employer, and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) that the employer took the adverse employment action because she had filed a sexual harassment complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Adverse employment actions may include actions by the employer amounting to a constructive discharge, the preparation of an unwarranted negative employment evaluation, an unwarranted disadvantageous transfer, or toleration of harassment by employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff does not have to prove that her sexual harassment claim has merit in order to prove her retaliation claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant requested a more explicit explanation of the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting scheme. The DOC argues that, in addition to the charge given, the jury should have been instructed explicitly as to the shifting burdens and upon which party's shoulders they fell. Specifically, the DOC objects to the absence of language in the district court's instruction pertaining to the plaintiff's burden to show that the reason for termination proffered by the DOC was pretextual.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not recount the intricacies of the McDonnell Douglas test here. The essence of McDonnell Douglas is a tripartite regimen. The plaintiff must first prove the prima facie case for retaliatory discharge. See Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 253 (1981). Thereafter, the defendant must rebut the presumption created by the prima facie case by producing a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the employer's action. See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. Once the defendant meets this burden, \"the trier of fact proceeds to the ultimate question: whether plaintiff has proved that the defendant intentionally discriminated against [the plaintiff]\" on the basis of the plaintiff's protected characteristic or action. St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 510 (1993). The plaintiff must \"be given a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate by competent evidence that the presumptively valid reasons for his rejection were in fact a cover-up for a... discriminatory decision.\" McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 805.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's jury instruction admittedly does not follow the exact regimen of McDonnell Douglas. It need not do so, however, to be sufficient. See Loeb v. Textron, Inc., 600 F.2d 1003, 1016 (1st Cir. 1979) (\"McDonnell Douglas was not written as a prospective jury charge; to read its technical aspects to a jury... will add little to a juror's understanding of the case.\"). What is important is that the instructions \"identify the important factual issues,\" id., for the jury to resolve.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The chief complaint of the defendant here is that the jury was not told that it had to find pretext, and that the burden of showing pretext lay with the plaintiff. While we agree that this is an \"important factual issue,\" we think that it was sufficiently presented to the jury. As we stated in Loeb: \"The central issue, which the court must put directly to the jury, is whether or not plaintiff was discharged 'because of [protected conduct]'\" Id. at 1017. Undoubtedly, the court put this issue to the jury. The court's instruction made clear to the jury that, in order to find for the plaintiff, it had to find \"that the employer took the adverse employment action because she had filed a sexual harassment complaint.\" (emphasis added). This substantially incorporated into the charge exactly what the defendant wished.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We refuse to impose upon district courts a rigidly formalist view of McDonnell Douglas' requirements. As we stated in Loeb, \"The Supreme Court has made it abundantly clear that McDonnell Douglas was intended to be neither 'rigid, mechanized, or ritualistic' nor the exclusive method for proving a claim of discrimination.\" Loeb, 600 F.2d at 1017 (internal citation omitted). To adopt the defendants' view would be to impose just such a \"rigid, mechanized, [and] ritualistic\" requirement on the district courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the district court.

The court (Barbadoro, J.) denied the motion and the case proceeded to trial. The defendant moved in limine to limit evidence to issues in the administrative complaint and the federal complaint. The district court denied this motion. At the close of the plaintiff's case, the defendant moved for judgment as a matter of law. The district court took the motion under advisement. The court charged the jury, and the defendant objected to part of the charge. Defendant's objection was overruled and the court submitted the case to the jury. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff on all three claims with an award of damages in the amount of $45,000.00. The defendant renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law verbally when the verdict was returned and thereafter in writing. The district court denied the defendant's motions, and this appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the defendant presents essentially three issues for review: (1) the plaintiff did not present sufficient evidence to support her claims of sexual harassment, hostile work environment, retaliation, and that the plaintiff had not proven that the defendant was liable for the acts of its employees;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> (2) the district court erred in denying the defendant's motion in limine to exclude evidence; and (3) the district court improperly instructed the jury by misstating the law. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the district court in all respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We briefly describe the facts here, but discuss them in greater detail where applicable and necessary for our discussion. The plaintiff was hired as a corrections officer (\"CO\") at the New Hampshire State Prison in Concord, New Hampshire in January 1993. She was qualified for the CO position and received positive evaluations in January 1994 and 1995. In early 1995, the plaintiff became a \"direct supervision officer\" (\"DSO\") for the inmates housed in the Hancock Unit (\"H-Building\"). In May of 1995, the plaintiff became the DSO of \"B Pod.\" Shortly thereafter, tensions developed between some of the other employees and the plaintiff. Some of these tensions were expressed in statements of a sexual nature directed at the plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff filed a complaint with the Discrimination Review Committee (\"DRC\") of the DOC on November 3, 1995 alleging sexual harassment. She also filed a copy of her complaint with the New Hampshire Human Rights Commission and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The plaintiff's suit in the district court followed. The plaintiff alleged that, after she filed her administrative complaint, the DOC and its employees retaliated against her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant argues before us that the district court erred when it denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment and motions for judgment as a matter of law. The DOC claims that the plaintiff did not provide sufficient evidence to prove the plaintiff's allegations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming that the decision is reviewable on this appeal -a matter on which we take no view - there is no point in discussing the court's ruling on the summary judgment motion separately from our treatment of the denial of the defendant's motions for judgment as a matter of law. This is because we find that the evidence supports the judge's denial of the motions for judgment as a matter of law<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and this amounts to an affirmance of the court's denial of the summary judgment motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the court's denial of defendant's motions for judgment as a matter of law de novo, but examine the evidence and inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. See Foster-Miller, Inc. v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Canada, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198861\"><a href=\"/opinion/198861/foster-miller-inc-v-babcock-wilcox/\"><span class=\"volume\">210</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir. 2000).

The Supreme Court has stated that when \"entertaining a motion for judgment as a matter of law, the court should review all of the evidence in the record. In doing so, however, the court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, and it may not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence.\" Reeves v.

The record reflects that Officer Colby (a male employee at the DOC who held the same position as the plaintiff) wanted to \"keep an eye\" on the plaintiff because he believed she was having a sexual affair with inmate York. Officer Colby told other employees: \"I think she's in there blowing him and screwing him.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Officer Colby referred to the plaintiff as \"Mrs. York.\" Inmates also referred to the plaintiff as \"Mrs. York\" because of the conversations they either heard or had with other prison employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff also evinced that sexual conversations and jokes were common at the DOC. The male employees graphically spoke of their evenings at clubs and bars, read pornographic magazines at work, discussed the size of mens' penises and stared at women's breasts. Two male employees openly discussed their experiences with Prozac and how it affected their sex lives. A sergeant stated: \"Oh, yeah, it will go up but it won't go down.\" A corporal explained that he had trouble getting an erection, and said to the plaintiff: \"Sherri, I'd have to tip you upside down and dunk you like a tea bag.\" Plaintiff alleged that another employee said to her: \"Gee, [the corporal] owed me a blow job for today, but seeing as though he's not here, you want to take care of that for me?\" The plaintiff testified that the \"disgusting comments,\" conversations and treatment of her were \"continuing,\" \"consistent\" and occurred \"everyday.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was also evidence that the plaintiff was subjected to disparate treatment because she was a woman. For example, the plaintiff was told by her supervisor not to enter the supply room with an inmate because she was a woman and something could happen to her. The supply room was frequently used by employees as a place where prison guards could speak privately with inmates. The supervisor claimed that he feared that the plaintiff would be hurt because she is \"a very pretty lady and we work in a hostile situation.\" The record reflects, however, that male guards had been hurt when they accompanied an inmate into a supply room, yet no male guard was given the same warning as the plaintiff and no male employee was prohibited from accompanying an inmate into the supply room.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another example of disparate treatment was when an employee of DOC asked the inmates living on the plaintiff's pod how they felt about a woman running their pod. The male employees of the DOC often commented that they would not allow their wives to work in the prison, and told the plaintiff that if she were their wife, they would not want her working there. Nothing like that was said to any male employee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It must also be noted that the DOC's own internal investigation found that \"the work environment became intimidating and hostile for [the plaintiff] caused by inappropriate behavior by fellow workers and unprofessionalism of supervisors.\" The investigators further found that \"the sexual remarks and innuendoes that were made concerning [the plaintiff] and an inmate[] made this a sexual harassment case.\" The investigation concluded that \"the fact that the chain of command broke down... the perceived favoritism of [the plaintiff] by fellow officers and the sexual remarks and innuendoes made, created an intimidating and hostile work environment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff provided more than sufficient evidence to support a claim for hostile work environment.

Proving employer liability depends in the first instance upon whether the alleged harassment is caused by a co-employee of the victim or a supervisor. If the harassment is caused by a co-employee, the employer is liable if it \"knew or should have known of the charged sexual harassment and failed to implement prompt and appropriate corrective action.\" Blanketship v. Parke Care Ctrs., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"745400\"><a href=\"/opinion/745400/75-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1351-71-empl-prac-dec-p-44965-leanna-c/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">868</span></a></span>, 872 (6th Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). If the offender is a supervisor, the employer is liable unless it proves the affirmative defense \"that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior, and... that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.\" Faragher, 524 U.S. at 807. Review of the record reveals ample evidence for the jury to find the DOC liable for the conduct of its employees-both supervisors and co-employees. The plaintiff showed that the DOC was aware of the charged sexual harassment because the plaintiff complained to her supervisors and subsequently filed a complaint with the Discrimination Review Committee of the DOC. The plaintiff presented evidence from which it could be found that the DOC did not handle the internal investigation properly or timely, and that the DOC allowed the conduct and comments to continue. Therefore, it was appropriate for the district court to deny the defendant's motion for judgment as a matter of law and allow the jury to determine that the DOC was liable for the conduct of plaintiff's co-employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence in the record also supports the claim that the DOC was liable for the conduct of its supervisors because it shows that the DOC failed to prove that it \"exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior.\" Faragher, 524 U.S. at 778. In addition, the plaintiff \"[took] advantage of any preventative or corrective opportunities provided by the employer,\" id., by filing her complaint with the DOC's internal investigatory committee. The record contains evidence from which the jury could have concluded that the DOC did not handle the internal investigation properly or timely, and that the DOC allowed the conduct and comments to continue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The DOC further argues that the plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation. To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must prove that \"(1) [s]he engaged in protected conduct under Title VII; (2) [s]he suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) the adverse action is casually connected to the protected activity.\" Hernandez-Torres v.

See Hernandez-Torres, 158 F.3d at 47. The plaintiff presented ample evidence for a jury to find that she suffered adverse employment actions subsequent to the filing of her complaint. Adverse employment actions include \"demotions, disadvantageous transfers or assignments, refusals to promote, unwarranted negative job evaluations, and toleration of harassment by other employees.\" Id. The plaintiff introduced evidence that other employees continued to harass her after she filed her complaint; that she was transferred out of her unit without her consent and not reassigned, but left to find another unit; and ultimately constructively discharged. There was sufficient evidence for a jury to find that the plaintiff suffered adverse employment action because she filed a complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. Motion In Limine</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to trial, the defendant moved in limine \"to limit the evidence and testimony... to the issues raised by Plaintiff's internal sexual harassment complaint of November 3, 1995 and her claims of subsequent retaliation.\" The defendant argued that \"allowing testimony concerning issues of which Plaintiff did not complain would not be relevant.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence in question was first brought up during the plaintiff's deposition. She claimed there were acts of sexual harassment which took place prior to the filing of the plaintiff's administrative complaint. The evidence included allegations that Corporal Brochu read pornography in the office; that Brochu, Hart and Bell used foul language and/or made sexual jokes or comments in her presence that she found offensive; and allegations about various other employees who were not specifically named in her administrative complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, ruling from the bench, denied the motion.

The court denied the motion and instructed the defendant that it could later argue to the jury that \"those matters should not be considered because [the DOC was not] negligent in failing to stop them because [the DOC] didn't know about them because the plaintiff never brought them to [its] attention and the jury will have to find out whether there was negligence or not.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that the evidence is relevant. \"'Relevant evidence' means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\" Fed.

In her administrative complaint, the plaintiff gives ten examples of the alleged discrimination in a \"partial list\" (emphasis added), consisting of almost two pages. Though the administrative complaint does not spell out all of the specific comments made by various employees, it was sufficient to describe the essential nature of the charge and to lead to a reasonable investigation thereof. As such, the evidence that the defendant wished to exclude fell within the scope of the administrative complaint and the plaintiff was entitled to bring it before the district court. See Powers, 915 F.2d at 38. The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the DOC's motion in limine and allowed the evidence to be introduced at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.

The DOC argues that, in addition to the charge given, the jury should have been instructed explicitly as to the shifting burdens and upon which party's shoulders they fell. Specifically, the DOC objects to the absence of language in the district court's instruction pertaining to the plaintiff's burden to show that the reason for termination proffered by the DOC was pretextual.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not recount the intricacies of the McDonnell Douglas test here. The essence of McDonnell Douglas is a tripartite regimen. The plaintiff must first prove the prima facie case for retaliatory discharge. See Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v.

Thereafter, the defendant must rebut the presumption created by the prima facie case by producing a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the employer's action. See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. Once the defendant meets this burden, \"the trier of fact proceeds to the ultimate question: whether plaintiff has proved that the defendant intentionally discriminated against [the plaintiff]\" on the basis of the plaintiff's protected characteristic or action.

While we agree that this is an \"important factual issue,\" we think that it was sufficiently presented to the jury. As we stated in Loeb: \"The central issue, which the court must put directly to the jury, is whether or not plaintiff was discharged 'because of [protected conduct]'\" Id. at 1017. Undoubtedly, the court put this issue to the jury. The court's instruction made clear to the jury that, in order to find for the plaintiff, it had to find \"that the employer took the adverse employment action because she had filed a sexual harassment complaint.\" (emphasis added). This substantially incorporated into the charge exactly what the defendant wished.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We refuse to impose upon district courts a rigidly formalist view of McDonnell Douglas' requirements. As we stated in Loeb, \"The Supreme Court has made it abundantly clear that McDonnell Douglas was intended to be neither 'rigid, mechanized, or ritualistic' nor the exclusive method for proving a claim of discrimination.\" Loeb, 600 F.2d at 1017 (internal citation omitted). To adopt the defendants' view would be to impose just such a \"rigid, mechanized, [and] ritualistic\" requirement on the district courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the district court.

Our reading of the transcript, however, reveals otherwise and we will consider the argument on the merits.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
