BRIGHAM, JR.,\r\n          Executor of the Estate of Anna C. Ham,\r\n\n                  Plaintiff, Appellant,\r\n\n                            v.\r\n\n                UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\r\n\n                   Defendant, Appellee.\r\n\n       APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n            FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n     [Hon. Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                  Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n       Aldrich and Coffin, Senior Circuit Judges.\r\n\n Paul M. Stein with whom Malkasian, Hicinbothem &amp; Mollica, Paul\r\nL. Brigham, Jr. and Linette R. LaMountain were on brief for\r\nappellant.\r\n Ernest J. Brown with whom Jonathan S. Cohen, Joan I.\r\nOppenheimer, Attorneys, Tax Division, Department of Justice,\r\nLoretta C. Argrett, Assistant Attorney General, and Donald K.\r\nStern, United States Attorney, were on brief for appellee.\r\n\nNovember 12, 1998\r\n\n  ALDRICH, Senior Circuit Judge.  This is an action to\r\nrecover income tax payments that, allegedly, were not due.  On\r\ncross motions for summary judgment the court ruled for the\r\nUnited States.  We affirm.\r\n  In 1988 Kendal Ham died leaving a will with several\r\nprovisions for his wife.  Seasonably she chose, instead, to\r\nwaive her rights under the will and elect the share of his\r\nestate permitted by the New Hampshire statute, N.H. Rev. Stat.\r\nAnn.  560:10, in her case a one-third \"portion of the estate\r\nremaining after the payment of debts and expenses of\r\nadministration.\"  In 1990 and 1991 Mr. Ham's executor made\r\npayments to Mrs. Ham on account of the principal of her\r\nelected share.  These payments included amounts equivalent to\r\nthe total income received by Mr. Ham's estate during those two\r\nyears.  His executor classified these inclusions as\r\n\"distributable net income\" (DNI) pursuant to 26 U.S.C.\r\n 643(a) and claimed a deduction from the estate's gross\r\nincome pursuant to 26 U.S.C.  661, which the government\r\nallowed.  Mrs. Ham, in turn, reported and paid an income tax\r\non the received DNI pursuant to 26 U.S.C.  662.\r\n  Mrs. Ham's executor, plaintiff Paul Brigham, Jr.,\r\nEsq., now claims it was inappropriate to apply the tax\r\ntransfer of  661 and 662 to payments in satisfaction of a\r\nwidow's elective share and that the income tax on Mr. Ham's\r\nestate's 1990 and 1991 earnings should not have been passed\r\non.  No income tax was required of Mrs. Ham on the portion of\r\nthe payments that exceeded Mr. Ham's estate's income, see 26\r\nU.S.C.  662(a), but, obviously, to the extent that payments\r\nto her were taxable, Mrs. Ham was paid her elected share in\r\nfunds subject to depreciation through taxes.\r\n  Unreasonable and unfair as this might seem, plaintiff\r\nhas an impossible row to hoe here.  If a payee within the 26\r\nU.S.C.  643(c) definition of \"beneficiary\" receives DNI\r\npursuant to  661 that is an \"other amount properly paid,\r\ncredited, or required to be distributed to such beneficiary\r\nfor the taxable year,\"  662(a)(2),  then she is bound to pay\r\nan income tax even if the payment was in satisfaction of a\r\nprincipal obligation.\r\n   Sections 661 and 662 are lengthy.  We quote all that\r\nis relevant to our facts and question:\r\n    661.    DEDUCTIONS FOR ESTATES AND TRUSTS\r\n             ACCUMULATING INCOME OR DISTRIBUTING\r\n             CORPUS\r\n\n        (a)  Deduction\r\n\n             In any taxable year there shall be\r\n        allowed as a deduction in computing the\r\n        taxable income of an estate . . . the\r\n        sum of --\r\n\n  . . . .                   \r\n\n                                                (2)  any other amounts\r\n                                           properly paid . . . for such\r\n                                           taxable year; but such deduction\r\n                                           shall not exceed the distributable\r\n                                           net income of the estate . . . .\r\n\n    662.    INCLUSION OF AMOUNTS IN GROSS INCOME OF\r\n             BENEFICIARIES OF ESTATES AND TRUSTS\r\n             ACCUMULATING INCOME OR DISTRIBUTING\r\n             CORPUS\r\n\n        (a)  Inclusion\r\n\n             [T]here shall be included in the\r\n        gross income of a beneficiary to whom an\r\n        amount specified in section 661(a) is\r\n        paid . . . the sum of the following\r\n        amounts:\r\n\n             (1)  Amounts required to be\r\n                  distributed currently\r\n\n                         . . . .\r\n\n                                           (2)  Other amounts distributed\r\n\n                  All other amounts properly paid\r\n             . . . to such beneficiary for the\r\n             taxable year.\r\n\nWe believe these statutes sufficiently clear as to need no\r\nhistory, but we remark that they are the product of the\r\ndifficulty (more indicated by portions we do not quote) of\r\ntracing the source of distributions from estates with many\r\nbeneficiaries.  See S. Rep. No. 83-1622, at 83 (1954),\r\nreprinted in 1954 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4621, 4715 (\"The approach\r\nadopted by the bill eliminates the necessity, in determining\r\nthe taxability of distributions, of tracing such distributions\r\nto the income of the estate or trust for the current taxable\r\nyear.\").  While the solution may over-simplify, it has never\r\nbeen found beyond the federal taxing power.  Obviously the\r\ntaxpayer must adjust to the government, not the government\r\nadjust to accommodate him.\r\n   Plaintiff, accordingly, claims that Mrs. Ham, as the\r\nreceiver of a one-third portion of Mr. Ham's estate, was not\r\na \"beneficiary\" within the meaning of  662.  This contention,\r\nhowever, fails.  For definition, 26 U.S.C.  643(c) provides\r\nthat \"the term 'beneficiary' includes heir, legatee, devisee.\" \r\nThe word \"elector\" (of a spouse's share) does not appear, but\r\n\"includes\" is not limiting.  Rather, \"[t]he terms 'includes'\r\nand 'including' . . . shall not be deemed to exclude other\r\nthings otherwise within the meaning of the term defined.\"  26\r\nU.S.C.  7701(c).  In light of this we apply the principle\r\nthat a list of terms should be construed to include by\r\nimplication those additional terms of like kind and class as\r\nthe expressly included terms.    Surely the widow has elected\r\nto be within the group.  In common parlance, is not any person\r\nwho gratuitously receives estate assets a beneficiary?  If\r\nthere is no will, the widow is an heir, and she receives a\r\nportion of the estate as determined by the legislature.  If\r\nthere is a will, she may be a legatee, or she may waive her\r\nrights under it and receive a different portion.  But, in all\r\ncases, on its face, the  661-662 tracing purpose applies\r\nprecisely.\r\n   Plaintiff's remaining argument is that the payments in\r\nsatisfaction of Mrs. Ham's elective share were not  662(a)(2)\r\ndistributions because the elective share is a state law\r\ninterest not subject to the estate income distribution\r\nprovisions in  661 and 662.  He has found in his favor the\r\ncase of Deutsch v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 74 T.C.M.\r\n(CCH) 935 (1997) (holding that the Florida elective share is\r\nnot subject to the entire Subchapter J, 26 U.S.C.  641-692). \r\nWe disagree fully.\r\n   The Deutsch court would draw comparisons between\r\nelective shares and the Florida dower.  Assuming that Florida\r\ndower may be exempt, which we may doubt, this would be because\r\nit is directly involved with real estate title which, like\r\njointly owned property may, in a technical sense, not pass\r\nthrough the estate, a claim that plaintiff here cannot make. \r\nBy definition, Mrs. Ham received \"a portion of the estate.\" \r\nNext, standing with one foot on the dower concept, Deutschreasons that in enacting a provision for elective shares the\r\nstate was protecting the interests of its widows.  Passing the\r\nfact that $800,000 is a good deal of protection, the\r\nproposition that, simply by fiat, a state may preserve its\r\ncitizens from federal taxes is absurd.  The list of exclusions\r\nin 26 U.S.C.  663 clearly does not exclude an elective share,\r\nand we note that the Treasury Regulations expressly deny\r\nexclusion even to a widow's temporary allowance.  \r\n   Plaintiff's appeal is without merit.\n",

Ann. &#167; 560:10, in her case a one-third \"portion of the estate remaining after the payment of debts and expenses of administration.\"   In 1990 and 1991 Mr. Ham's executor made payments to Mrs. Ham on account of the principal of her elected share.  These payments included amounts equivalent to the total income received by Mr. Ham's estate during those two years.  His executor classified these inclusions as \"distributable net income\" (DNI) pursuant to 26 U.S.C. &#167; 643(a) and claimed a deduction from the estate's gross income pursuant to 26 U.S.C. &#167; 661, which the government allowed.  Mrs. Ham, in turn, reported and paid an income tax on the received DNI pursuant to 26 U.S.C. &#167; 662.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mrs. Ham's executor, plaintiff Paul Brigham, Jr., Esq., now claims it was inappropriate to apply the tax transfer of &#167;&#167; 661 and 662 to payments in satisfaction of a widow's elective share and that the income tax on Mr. Ham's estate's 1990 and 1991 earnings should not have been passed on.  No income tax was required of Mrs. Ham on the portion of the payments that exceeded Mr. Ham's estate's income, see 26 U.S.C. &#167; 662(a), but, obviously, to the extent that payments to her were taxable, Mrs. Ham was paid her elected share in funds subject to depreciation through taxes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unreasonable and unfair as this might seem, plaintiff has an impossible row to hoe here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  If a payee within the 26 U.S.C. &#167; 643(c) definition of \"beneficiary\" receives DNI pursuant to &#167; 661 that is an \"other amount properly paid, credited, or required to be distributed to such beneficiary for the taxable year,\" &#167; 662(a)(2), then she is bound to pay an income tax even if the payment was in satisfaction of a principal obligation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sections 661 and 662 are lengthy.

See S.Rep. No. 83-1622, at 83 (1954), reprinted in 1954 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4621, 4715 (\"The approach adopted by the bill eliminates the necessity, in determining the taxability of distributions, of tracing such distributions to the income of the estate or trust for the current taxable year.\").  While the solution may over-simplify, it has never been found beyond the federal taxing power.  Obviously the taxpayer must adjust to the government, not the government adjust to accommodate him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff, accordingly, claims that Mrs. Ham, as the receiver of a one-third portion of Mr. Ham's estate, was not a \"beneficiary\" within the meaning of &#167; 662.  This contention, however, fails.  For definition, 26 U.S.C. &#167; 643(c) provides that \"the term 'beneficiary' includes heir, legatee, devisee.\"   The word \"elector\" (of a spouse's share) does not appear, but \"includes\" is not limiting.  Rather, \"[t]he terms 'includes' and 'including' ... shall not be deemed to exclude other things otherwise within the meaning of the term defined.\"  26 U.S.C. &#167; 7701(c).  In light of this we apply the principle that a list of terms should be construed to include by implication those additional terms of like kind and class as the expressly included terms.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Surely the widow has elected to be within the group.  In common parlance, is not any person who gratuitously receives estate assets a beneficiary?   If there is no will, the widow is an heir, and she receives a portion of the estate as determined by the legislature.  If there is a will, she may be a legatee, or she may waive her rights under it and receive a different portion.  But, in all cases, on its face, the &#167;&#167; 661-662 tracing purpose applies precisely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff's remaining argument is that the payments in satisfaction of Mrs. Ham's elective share were not &#167; 662(a)(2) distributions because the elective share is a state law interest not subject to the estate income distribution provisions in &#167;&#167; 661 and 662.  He has found in his favor the case of Deutsch v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 74 T.C.M.  (CCH) 935, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">633208</span></span> (1997) (holding that the Florida elective share is not subject to the entire Subchapter J, 26 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 641-692).  We disagree fully.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Deutsch court would draw comparisons between elective shares and the Florida dower.  Assuming that Florida dower may be exempt, which we may doubt, this would be because it is directly involved with real estate title which, like jointly owned property may, in a technical sense, not pass through the estate, a claim that plaintiff here cannot make.  By definition, Mrs. Ham received \"a portion of the estate.\"   Next, standing with one foot on the dower concept, Deutsch reasons that in enacting a provision for elective shares the state was protecting the interests of its widows.  Passing the fact that $800,000 is a good deal of protection, the proposition that, simply by fiat, a state may preserve its citizens from federal taxes is absurd.  The list of exclusions in 26 U.S.C. &#167; 663 clearly does not exclude an elective share, and we note that the Treasury Regulations expressly deny exclusion even to a widow's temporary allowance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff's appeal is without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> He can, of course, negotiate with the other estate</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> This follows from the canon noscitur a sociis, \"a word is known by the company it keeps.\"  Neal v.
