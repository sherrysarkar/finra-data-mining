Brady\n(\"Brady\") filed this action against defendant The Credit Recovery\nCompany (\"CRC\" or \"defendant\") and its president and clerk\nLeslie A. Clark (\"Clark\" or \"defendant\") to redress alleged\nviolations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (the\n\"FDCPA\"), 15 U.S.C.  1692-1692o, and of related state law\nobligations.\nThe district court dismissed Brady's FDCPA claim for\nfailure to state a claim pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) and\ndismissed the remaining state law claims without prejudice for\nlack of jurisdiction.  In its memorandum and order, the district\ncourt recited the standard governing 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss\nbut relied in part on materials outside of the pleadings.  We\ntherefore treat the motion as one for summary judgment.  SeeDominique v. Weld, 73 F.3d 1156, 1158 (1st Cir. 1996).\nWe review a grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing\nthe facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovant,\nplaintiff, see id., and conclude that the order of\ndismissal/grant of summary judgment must be reversed. \nAccordingly, we remand this case for action consistent with this\nopinion.\nI.  BACKGROUND\n Prior to 1990, Brady's then wife leased an apartment\nand failed to pay $470 in rent.  Brady never signed the lease in\nquestion but was named in the lease as a tenant.  In August 1990,\nthe landlord referred the Brady account to defendants for\ncollection of the unpaid rent.\nOn September 4, 1990, defendants initiated the\ncollection process by sending Brady a letter requesting payment\nof the debt.  On September 13, Brady phoned Clark and explained\nthat he had never signed the lease in question, that his ex-wife\nalone had signed the lease, and that therefore he had no\nobligation to pay the unpaid rent.  Clark told Brady to submit a\nwritten letter to dispute the debt.  Brady never put the dispute\nin writing.\nOver the next few months, defendants sent Brady two\nmore dunning letters and made two phone calls to him, none of\nwhich drew a response.  In August 1991, CRC reported Brady's\nalleged debt to various credit reporting agencies without also\nreporting Brady's dispute.\nFive years later, in February 1996, Brady applied for a\nmortgage to purchase a home.  The mortgage company hired a credit\nagency, First American Credit Services (\"First American\"), to\ncheck Brady's credit history.  Upon learning of Brady's bad\ncredit report, the credit agency called defendants to inquire\nabout the unpaid debt.  As it had done in 1991, CRC again\nreported the unpaid rent as Brady's debt without reporting its\ndisputed status.  The mortgage company subsequently advised Brady\nthat his financing was in jeopardy because of the listing of the\nrent as an outstanding debt on his credit report.\nBrady immediately contacted defendants and informed\nthem, once again, that he was not liable for the unpaid rent. \nDefendants again refused to remove the debt from Brady's credit\nreport.  One month later, Brady's attorney contacted CRC's\nattorney who, in turn, advised CRC to withdraw the bad credit\nreport.  CRC promptly removed the unpaid rent from Brady's credit\nreport.\nThereafter, Brady brought this suit alleging that\ndefendants violated the FDCPA by failing to inform First American\nthat Brady disputed the debt.  Brady also brings pendent state\nlaw claims under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93,  24, 50 and ch. 93A.\nII.  DISCUSSION\nWe review de novo a district court's grant of summary\njudgment.  See Bethlehem Steel Export Corp. v. Redondo Constr.\nCorp., 140 F.3d 319, 320 (1st Cir. 1998).   \nBrady claims that defendants violated a provision of\nthe FDCPA, which proscribes debt collectors from making any\n\"false, deceptive or misleading representation[s] . . . in\nconnection with the collection of any debt.\"  15 U.S.C.  1692e. \nMore specifically, Brady argues that defendants violated  1692e\nby failing to inform First American of the disputed status of the\nunpaid rent listed on his credit report.  Section 1692e(8)\nexplicitly states that the failure of a debt collector to\ndisclose the disputed status of a debt constitutes a \"false,\ndeceptive, or misleading representation.\"  Id. 1692e(8).\nDefendants do not contest the facts.  Rather,\ndefendants argue that the facts do not, as a matter of law, rise\nto the level of \"false, deceptive, or misleading\nrepresentation[s]\" in violation of  1692e(8) because Brady never\ndisputed the debt in writing.  This case thus turns on a narrow\nquestion of statutory construction: Should  1692e(8) of the\nFDCPA -- which on its face does not impose a writing requirement\n-- be read to impose a writing requirement on a consumer who\nwishes to dispute a debt?\n\"In a statutory construction case, the beginning point\nmust be the language of the statute, and when a statute speaks\nwith clarity to an issue judicial inquiry into the statute's\nmeaning in all but the most extraordinary circumstance is\nfinished.\"  Riva v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 61 F.3d 1003,\n1007 (1st Cir. 1995) (quoting Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos\nDrilling Co., 505 U.S. 469, 475 (1992)) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).  In other words, the court need not consult legislative\nhistory and other aids to statutory construction when the words\nof the statute neither create an ambiguity nor lead to an\nunreasonable interpretation.  Riva, 61 F.3d at 1007 (quotations\nomitted).  In searching a statute's text to determine\ncongressional intent, we attribute to words that are not defined\nin the statute itself their ordinary usage, while keeping in mind\nthat meaning can only be ascribed to statutory language if that\nlanguage is taken in context.  Id. (quotations omitted). \nApplying these tenets, we conclude that  1692e(8) does not\nimpose a writing requirement on a consumer who wishes to dispute\na debt.\nBecause the FDCPA does not include the terms \"dispute\"\nor \"disputed debt\" in the section devoted to definitions, see 15\nU.S.C.  1692a, we look first to ordinary usage.  In ordinary\nEnglish \"dispute\" is defined as a \"verbal controversy\" and\n\"controversial discussion.\"  Webster's Third New International\nDictionary (3d ed. 1971).  Clearly, the ordinary usage of\n\"dispute\" does not contemplate a writing.  See id.  Defendants\nargue that a writing requirement should be implied from other\nsections of the statute and from context.  We address these\narguments.\nFirst, defendants argue that we need not resort to\nordinary usage because the FDCPA does in fact define the term\n\"disputed debts.\"  In support of this contention, defendants\npoint to  1692g(b) which is captioned \"disputed debts.\"  See 15\nU.S.C.  1692g(b).  Although we cannot assume that  1692g(b)\ndefines this term simply because of its caption, see Pub. L. 90-\n321,  502 (May 29, 1968), 82 Stat. 146, 147, reported as a note\nfollowing 15 U.S.C.  1601 (forbidding reliance on captions),\ndefendants contend that the text of  1692g(b) provides a\ndefinition of \"disputed debts\" that carries over to  1692e(8). \nWe disagree.\nAs stated above, we must keep in mind that meaning can\nonly be ascribed to statutory language if that language is taken\nin context.  See Riva, 61 F.3d at 1007.  Viewing the language of\n1692e(8) in the context of other provisions of the FDCPA, it\nmakes logical sense to conclude that the meaning of \"disputed\ndebt\" in  1692g(b) does not carry over to  1692e(8).  \nFirst, the fact that other sections of the FDCPA --\nlike  1692g(b) -- explicitly impose a  writing requirement\nsuggests that Congress's omission of such a requirement in \n1692e(8) was not inadvertent.  Moreover, a closer examination of\nthe purposes and effects of the two provisions further supports\nour conclusion that Congress intended to require a writing under\n1692g(b) but not under  1692e(g).\nUnder section 1692g(b) a consumer must dispute a debt\nin writing, within an initial thirty-day period, in order to\ntrigger a debt validation process.  See 15 U.S.C. 1692g(b). \nOnce a consumer exercises this right, a debt collector must cease\nall further debt collection activity until it complies with\nvarious verification obligations.  See id.  Section 1692g(b) thus\nconfers on consumers the ultimate power vis-a-vis debt\ncollectors: the power to demand the cessation of all collection\nactivities.  See id.  Recognizing the broad consumer power\ngranted by this provision, Congress expressly conditioned its\nexercise on the submission of written notification within a\nlimited thirty-day window.  See id. \nIn contrast,  1692e(8) does not affect debt collection\npractices at all.  See 15 U.S.C.  1692e(8).  Instead,  1692e(8)\nmerely requires a debt collector who knows or should know that a\ngiven debt is disputed to disclose its disputed status to persons\ninquiring about a consumer's credit history.  See id.   Given the\nmuch more limited effect of this provision, Congress's decision\nnot to condition its exercise on the submission of written\nnotification makes logical sense.\nOur conclusion that  1692g(b) does not define\n\"disputed debt\" for the entire FDCPA is further supported by the\nlanguage of  1692e(8) itself.  If the meaning of \"disputed debt\"\nas used in  1692g(b) carried over to  1692e(8), then, in order\nto trigger the limited protection of  1692e(8), a consumer would\nbe required to submit written notice to a debt collector within\nthe initial thirty-day period.  See 15 U.S.C.  1692g(b).  But\nthe plain language of  1692e(8) requires debt collectors to\ncommunicate the disputed status of a debt if the debt collector\n\"knows or should know\" that the debt is disputed.  See 15 U.S.C.\n1692e(8).  This \"knows or should know\" standard requires no\nnotification by the consumer, written or oral, and instead,\ndepends solely on the debt collector's knowledge that a debt is\ndisputed, regardless of how or when that knowledge is acquired. \nSee id.  Applying the meaning of \"disputed debt\" as used in \n1692g(b) to  1692e(8) would thus render the provision's \"knows\nor should know\" language impermissibly superfluous.  See United\nStates v. Bailey, 516 U.S. 137, 145 (1995) (quoting Ratzlaf v.\nUnited States, 510 U.S. 135, 140-41 (1994) (\"Judges should\nhesitate . . . to treat [as surplusage] statutory terms in any\nsetting . . . .\"). \nIII.  CONCLUSION   \nWe therefore conclude that  1692e(8) does not impose a\nwriting requirement on consumers who wish to dispute a debt.  For\nthe foregoing reasons, we reverse the district court's order of\ndismissal/grant of summary judgment and remand this case for\naction consistent with this opinion.\n",

Bailey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117985\"><a href=\"/opinion/117985/bailey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 145 (1995) (quoting Ratzlaf v.\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112919\"><a href=\"/opinion/112919/ratzlaf-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">135</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 140-41 (1994) (\"Judges should\nhesitate . . . to treat [as surplusage] statutory terms in any\nsetting . . . .\"). \nIII.  CONCLUSION   \nWe therefore conclude that  1692e(8) does not impose a\nwriting requirement on consumers who wish to dispute a debt.  For\nthe foregoing reasons, we reverse the district court's order of\ndismissal/grant of summary judgment and remand this case for\naction consistent with this opinion.\n</pre>",
