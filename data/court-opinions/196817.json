After  a careful  review of  the parties'\r                            \r\n\nbriefs  and  the record,  we find  no  reason to  reverse the\r\n\nmandatory  minimum sentence  imposed  by the  district  court\r\n\nunder  21 U.S.C.    841(b)(1)(B).   The district  court found\r\n\nthat  the  defendant was  not  entitled  to relief  from  the\r\n\nmandatory  minimum sentence  because  he  had not  truthfully\r\n\nprovided  to  the  government  all  the  information  he  had\r\n\nconcerning the offenses.  See 18 U.S.C.   3553(f); U.S.S.G.  \r                                         \r\n\n5C1.2.  That determination is supported by the applicable law\r\n\nand the information presented at the sentencing hearing.\r\n\n     In   his  last-minute  letter  to  the  government,  the\r\n\ndefendant acknowledged  that the drug transaction occurred in\r\n\nhis  apartment but,  claiming his  co-defendant obtained  the\r\n\ndrugs,  disclaimed any  knowledge of  where the  cocaine came\r\n\nfrom.   But,  in  addition to  the  kilogram offered  in  the\r\n\ntransaction,  the defendant's  apartment contained  two other\r\n\ncaches  of cocaine.   Further, there were  other indicia that\r\n\nthe  defendant  was a  professional  drug  dealer (the  large\r\n\namount paid by the  defendant to enter the  country illegally\r\n\nto take a low-paying job; defendant's possession of a beeper;\r\n\nand defendant's significant role in the transaction).\r\n\n     Accordingly, the district  judge was  fully entitled  to\r\n\nconclude that  the defendant's role  was not, as  he claimed,\r\n\nthat  of a  mere middle man  in one transaction  and that the\r\n\ndefendant,  if he had wanted,  could have told the government\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nmore about the origins of the cocaine and the workings of the\r\n\noperation.  Defendant  bore the burden to persuade  the court\r\n\nthat the safety valve conditions  had been met, United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.
