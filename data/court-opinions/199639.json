José Antonio Fusté, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                      Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                  Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n              and Doumar,* Senior District Judge.\n\n\n\n     Howard M. Srebnick, Christine Ng, and Black, Srebnick &\nKornspan, P.A., on brief for appellant.\n     Nelson Perez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, and Jorge E. Vega-\nPacheco were on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                       October 19, 2001\n\f* Of the Eastern District of Virginia, sitting by designation.\n\f          STAHL, Senior Circuit Judge.        The defendant, Elliot\n\nGiraud-Pineiro, pled guilty to conspiracy to possess cocaine\n\nwith intent to distribute and conspiracy to finance illegal\n\nnarcotics transactions.     He now appeals his sentence. For the\n\nfollowing reasons, we affirm.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          In a multi-count indictment that named numerous co-\n\ndefendants, Giraud-Pineiro was charged in three counts: Count\n\nOne alleged that the defendants conspired to possess with intent\n\nto distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine and more than\n\none kilogram of heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1)\n\nand 846; Count Two alleged that the defendants conspired to\n\nfinance these illegal transactions in violation of 18 U.S.C. §\n\n1956; and Count Six was a forfeiture count.\n\n          Defendant initially pled not guilty to these charges.\n\nOn May 17, 2000, Giraud-Pineiro and the government entered into\n\na plea agreement, in which he agreed to plead guilty to the\n\noffenses charged in Counts One and Two of the indictment.           The\n\nplea agreement states that the defendant was originally indicted\n\nfor   possessing   more   than   five   kilograms   of   cocaine,   and\n\nincorporates a factual statement that the conspiracy involved\n\nhundreds of kilograms of cocaine and that the defendant's role\n\nwas to finance the cocaine shipments and manage the financial\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\ftransactions so as to conceal the illegal proceeds.              In return\n\nfor his guilty plea, the government agreed that the defendant\n\nwould   “be    held   accountable   in     determining     the   applicable\n\nguideline range to at least three point five (3.5) but less than\n\nfive (5) kilograms of cocaine.”        This stipulation had the effect\n\nof decreasing defendant's penalty exposure from ten years to\n\nlife imprisonment, see 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A), to a range of\n\nfive to forty years, see 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B). In the plea\n\nagreement, it was agreed that the applicable offense level for\n\nthe more serious count in the indictment (Count One) would be\n\n30,1 translating into a sentencing range of 97 to 121 months for\n\na defendant with no prior criminal history.                Based on this\n\ncalculation, the government agreed that it would recommend to\n\nthe Court a sentence of 120 months.2\n\n          At    the   change-of-plea      hearing,   the   district   court\n\nadvised the defendant about the consequences of pleading guilty,\n\nand informed him that, as Count One of the indictment reads, it\n\ncarried a mandatory minimum term of ten years to a maximum of\n\n\n    1     This offense level was calculated by using a base\noffense level of 30, applicable for the 3.5 to less than five\nkilogram quantity, minus three levels for acceptance of\nresponsibility, plus three levels for defendant's role in the\noffense.\n    2     The plea agreement left defendant free to argue for a\nsentence at the lower end of the applicable guideline range.\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\flife imprisonment.        However, the district court specifically\n\nnoted that the plea agreement stated that the government would\n\nonly attribute to defendant an amount of cocaine of at least 3.5\n\nkilograms but less than five kilograms.            The defendant confirmed\n\nthat this was his understanding.            Satisfied that the decision of\n\nthe defendant was made knowingly and voluntarily, the district\n\ncourt accepted the change of plea.\n\n           The probation office's presentence report recognized\n\nthat the defendant had pled guilty to the offenses listed in the\n\nindictment, but that the plea agreement stipulated to a lesser\n\nquantity of drugs.        The report also confirmed the government's\n\ncalculation of the base offense level (30) and criminal history\n\ncategory (I), indicating a guideline range of 97 to 121 months\n\nimprisonment, with an applicable five-year mandatory minimum.\n\nThe district court accepted the recommendation of the probation\n\noffice and adopted its calculations as the applicable guideline\n\nrange in this case.        At sentencing, as agreed, the government\n\nrecommended that the defendant be sentenced to a term of 120\n\nmonths.        The defendant was then sentenced to a term of 120\n\nmonths    on    Counts   One   and   Two,    to   be   served   concurrently,\n\nfollowed by five years of supervised release.\n\n                                      II.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f         Giraud-Pineiro appeals his sentence, claiming that the\n\nprosecutor breached the plea agreement by suggesting that he\n\nwas, in fact, responsible for “hundreds” of kilograms of drugs,\n\ndirectly contradicting the amount stipulated by the parties.\n\nDefendant emphasizes that during the sentencing hearing the\n\ngovernment claimed that he had pled guilty to more than five\n\nkilograms of cocaine, and, as a result, the court sentenced him\n\nto the mandatory minimum of 120 months for the sale of more than\n\nfive kilos.   As a result, Giraud-Pineiro insists that he is\n\nentitled to a new sentencing hearing before a different judge.\n\n\n\n         This court exercises plenary review over the issue of\n\nwhether the government has breached a plea agreement.         See\n\nUnited States v. Clark, 55 F.3d 9, 11 (1st Cir. 1995).   However,\n\nwe review only for plain error when the defendant has knowledge\n\nof the conduct that purportedly amounts to a breach of the plea\n\nagreement, but nevertheless fails to bring it to the attention\n\nof the district court, as is the case here.    See United States\n\nv. Saxena, 229 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2000) (citing, inter alia,\n\nJohnson v. United States, 520 U.S. 461, 466 (1997)).\n\n         We are satisfied that there was no breach of the plea\n\nagreement in this case.   The government fulfilled its obligation\n\nunder the plea agreement when it recommended a sentence of 120\n\n\n                               -6-\n\fmonths.   Even though Giraud-Pineiro pled guilty to Count One of\n\nthe indictment, which stated that the offense involved more than\n\nfive kilograms of cocaine, the judge made clear at the change-\n\nof-plea   hearing    that   he   would   only   hold   the   defendant\n\nresponsible for an amount greater than 3.5 kilograms but less\n\nthan five kilograms in accordance with the joint stipulation.3\n\nLikewise, at the sentencing hearing, the judge emphasized that\n\nhe was only taking into account the lesser amount of drugs, as\n\nreflected in the plea agreement, when making his sentencing\n\ndetermination.4     Nothing in the transcript suggests that the\n\nsentencing judge believed that the statutory mandatory minimum\n\nof ten years was applicable to defendant's case.         Nor did the\n\nsentencing judge indicate that he was influenced by the fact\n\nthat, in the absence of the stipulation, the defendant would\n\nhave been subject to the ten-year mandatory minimum.         The trial\n\njudge simply accepted the recommendation of the government,\n\n\n\n\n    3     (“Regarding guidelines, you're going to be held liable\nfor at least 3.5, but less than five kilos of cocaine. . . .\nThere is together to be a recommendation that you be sentenced\nin both cases to 120 months.”).\n    4     (“[Defendant] stipulated to an amount of drug [sic],\nand he's going to walk out the door sentenced to that amount of\ndrugs. . . .”);        (“[Defendant] stipulated that he was\nresponsible for at least 3.5 but less than 5 kilos of cocaine,\nand that gives us a base level of 30 under guideline section\n2D1.1.“).\n\n                                 -7-\n\fapparently because he believed that a sentence at the high end\n\nof the guideline range was appropriate.\n\n                             III.\n\n         Having found no error in the proceedings below, we\n\nhereby affirm the sentence imposed by the district court.\n\n         Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                             -8-\n\f",
