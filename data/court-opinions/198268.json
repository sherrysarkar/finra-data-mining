CHATER, COMMISSIONER,\r\nSOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION,\r\n\n      Defendant, Appellee.\r\n\nAPPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND\r\n\n[Hon. Robert W. Lovegreen, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\r\n\n             Before\r\n\n    Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\nSelya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\r\n\nKelly McKenna Cournoyer and Green, Greenberg &amp; Nesselbush on\r\nbrief for appellant.\r\nSheldon Whitehouse, United States Attorney, Anthony C.\r\nDiGioia, Assistant U.S. Attorney, and Robert M. Peckrill, Assistant\r\nRegional Counsel, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nDecember 30, 1998\r\n\nPer Curiam.  After carefully reviewing the briefs and record\r\non appeal, we affirm the judgment below.  Substantial evidence\r\nsupported the Appeals Council's determination that the appellant\r\ndid not show that she had a disabling impairment.  The appellant's\r\nclaim that she suffered a severe, continuing impairment received\r\nlittle support from the medical evidence for the relevant period.\r\nSee Dupuis v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 869 F.2d 622,\r\n623 (1st Cir. 1988)(per curiam).  Although the appellant presented\r\naffidavits from non-medical sources which tended to show that her\r\nactivities were restricted during the relevant period, it would be\r\nreasonable to view her failure to seek treatment as undermining the\r\nprobative value of the evidence.  See Irlanda Ortiz v. Secretary of\r\nHealth and Human Services, 955 F.2d 765, 770 (1st Cir. 1991)(per\r\ncuriam)(implicit in  finding of disability is determination that\r\nexisting treatments would not restore ability to work).\r\nAffirmed.  Loc. R. 27.1.\r\n",
