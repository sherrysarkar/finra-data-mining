HARMON,\n\n                    Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                              v.\n\n                  BENNIE K. BULLOCK, ET AL.,\n\n                    Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n              FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n        [Hon. Richard G. Stearns, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                   Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n          Campbell and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n    Leonard B. Harmon on brief pro se.\n\n\n\n\n                       October 9, 2001\n\f              Per Curiam.     Plaintiff Leonard Harmon was arrested\n\nand charged with criminal trespass after refusing to leave\n\nthe house of a woman (Bennie Bullock--the mother of his\n\ndaughter) who had temporarily provided him with a room.\n\nWhen those charges were dropped, plaintiff responded with\n\nthe instant 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action, filed pro se and in\n\nforma pauperis, alleging violation of his constitutional\n\nrights.    Named as defendants were Bullock and the Dorchester\n\ndistrict      court    (the    venue        for    the    aborted      criminal\n\nproceedings).         The district court reviewed the complaint\n\nprior to service of process, in accordance with 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1915(e)(2),      and   discerned      no     arguable       legal   basis    for\n\nplaintiff's claims.         After spelling out the deficiencies in\n\nthe complaint, the court gave plaintiff 35 days to show\n\ncause why it should not be dismissed.                    Plaintiff filed no\n\nresponse (or any other pleading) within that time--he admits\n\non   appeal    that    he   \"refused\"       to    respond    because    of   his\n\ndisagreement with the court's analysis--and the case was\n\naccordingly      dismissed     with    prejudice.           Only    later,    in\n\nconjunction with a timely motion to amend judgment, and\n\nwithout any explanation for his tardiness, did plaintiff\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\ffinally submit a response to the show-cause order.                   That\n\nmotion was summarily denied, and plaintiff now appeals.\n\n             We affirm.    By itself, plaintiff's unexplained\n\nfailure to respond in timely fashion to the show-cause order\n\nwould   provide    a   sufficient        basis    for    upholding     the\n\ndismissal.     Nor did the district court err in concluding\n\nthat the complaint was \"frivolous or malicious\" or \"fail[ed]\n\nto state a claim\" within the meaning of § 1915(e)(2)(B).\n\nPlaintiff asserts that the criminal-trespass charges were\n\nunfounded, in that he fell within a statutory exception\n\ninvolving \"tenants or occupants of residential premises.\"\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 266, § 120 (¶ 2).                   Even if so, the\n\nDorchester district court, which is a state entity, is\n\nimmune from § 1983 liability for the reasons enumerated by\n\nthe district court; the cases involving municipal agencies\n\non   which    plaintiff   relies    are       inapposite.     In     turn,\n\nplaintiff has provided no factual support for his suggestion\n\nthat Bullock, by conspiring with the arresting officers, was\n\nherself acting \"under color\" of law for § 1983 purposes.\n\nThe district court afforded plaintiff ample opportunity to\n\namend   his   complaint   in   order     to    correct    these   various\n\nshortcomings.     As mentioned, plaintiff chose not to respond.\n\nNor has he set forth any supplemental allegations, either in\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fhis untimely response to the show-cause order or in his\n\nbrief on appeal, that would enable him to surmount the §\n\n1915(e)(2) hurdle.\n\n          Plaintiff also contends that the district court's\n\nrulings   called   its   impartiality   into   question   and   so\n\nwarranted its recusal--an allegation we reject on its face\n\nas frivolous.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -4-\n\f",
