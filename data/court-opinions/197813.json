C.B. Trucking, Inc. brought\r\nthis action against Waste Management of Massachusetts, Inc. and its\r\nparent, WMX Technologies, Inc., alleging, among other things, that\r\ndefendants had illegally attempted to monopolize the residential\r\nsolid waste collection business in southeastern Massachusetts\r\nthrough a practice of predatory pricing.  Treating defendants'\r\nmotion to dismiss for failure to state a claim as a motion for\r\nsummary judgment, the district court summarily disposed of the\r\npredatory pricing claims.  On appeal, C.B. Trucking asserts that\r\nthe district court erred because it:  (1) failed to properly notify\r\nthe parties of its intention to convert the motion into a motion\r\nfor summary judgment; (2) ruled on the motion without giving C.B.\r\nTrucking an opportunity to conduct discovery; and (3) granted\r\nsummary judgment even though facts material to the motion remained\r\nin genuine dispute.  We reject these arguments and affirm the\r\ndistrict court.\r\n                       I.\r\n                      A.\r\nC.B. Trucking is a family-owned company that operates a\r\nresidential solid waste collection business in southeastern\r\nMassachusetts.  From 1990 through 1994, the company collected\r\nresidential solid waste in Franklin and Medway, Massachusetts,\r\npursuant to contracts with those towns.  In 1994, after a process\r\nof public bidding, Franklin and Medway, as well as the nearby town\r\nof Norton, Massachusetts, awarded Waste Management exclusive\r\nresidential solid waste collection contracts.  In securing these\r\ncontracts, Waste Management outbid not only local operators such as\r\nC.B. Trucking, but also national operators such as Browning-Ferris\r\nIndustries and Laidlaw Waste Systems, Inc.  Each contract was for\r\na three-year term and required Waste Management to perform\r\nspecified collection services for a fixed price during the contract\r\nterm.\r\nWaste Management's bids for the Medway and Norton\r\ncontracts were lower than the next lowest bids by approximately\r\n$40,000 in each case.  The company's final bid for the Franklin\r\ncontract at $1.58 million came in under C.B. Trucking's final bid\r\nby only about $4000.\r\n                      B.\r\nC.B. Trucking brought this action against Waste\r\nManagement and WMX Technologies asserting that defendants had:  (1)\r\nviolated the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.A.  1, 2 (West 1997), by\r\nattempting to monopolize the residential solid waste business in\r\nsoutheastern Massachusetts through a practice of predatory pricing;\r\n(2) violated the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C.A.  13, 13a (West\r\n1997), by engaging in predatory pricing; (3) intentionally\r\ninterfered with existing contracts between C.B. Trucking and the\r\ntowns of Franklin and Medway in violation of Massachusetts law; and\r\n(4) engaged in unfair and deceptive business practices in violation\r\nof the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act, Mass. Gen. Laws Ann.\r\nch. 93A (West 1997).\r\nDefendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to\r\nstate a claim pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  At a hearing\r\non the motion, the district court asked Waste Management to submit\r\nan affidavit addressing the limited issue of whether its bids for\r\nthe three contracts at issue were below its costs.  The court also\r\nadvised C.B. Trucking that it could respond to Waste Management's \r\naffidavit as it saw fit.\r\nFollowing the hearing, Waste Management submitted an\r\naffidavit from the employee who had prepared its bids and managed\r\nthe contracts at issue, stating that Waste Management had not lost\r\nmoney on any of the contracts.  The affidavit also alleged that\r\nWaste Management had lost out in bidding on other residential solid\r\nwaste contracts in the same geographic area during the relevant\r\ntime period, and that it currently faced competition in the area\r\nfrom approximately eighteen trash haulers.  After seeking and\r\nobtaining additional time to respond, C.B. Trucking countered with\r\nan affidavit from its president who concluded that Waste\r\nManagement's bids must have been below its own costs because they\r\nwere below C.B. Trucking's costs.\r\nHaving solicited the affidavits, the court converted\r\ndefendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motion into a motion for summary\r\njudgment.  It then disposed of the predatory pricing claims by\r\nconcluding that C.B. Trucking had failed to produce sufficient\r\nevidence that Waste Management had engaged in below-cost pricing to\r\nwithstand summary judgment.  It also declined to exercise\r\nsupplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims.  On appeal,\r\nC.B. Trucking contests only the dismissal of its Sherman Act\r\npredatory pricing claim.\r\n                     II.\r\n                      A.\r\nC.B. Trucking first asserts that the district court erred\r\nbecause it never expressly notified the parties of its intention to\r\nconvert defendants' motion to dismiss into one for summary\r\njudgment.  Had the court done so, C.B. Trucking contends, it would\r\nhave sought additional time to conduct discovery in order to gather\r\nthe evidence needed to withstand the motion.  \r\nRule 12(b) provides that a court shall convert a motion\r\nto dismiss for failure to state a claim into one for summary\r\njudgment if \"matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not\r\nexcluded by the court.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b).  We employ a\r\nfunctional approach to the conversion process.  See Rodrguez v.\r\nFullerton Tires Corp., 115 F.3d 81, 83 (1st Cir. 1997). \r\nAccordingly, we have not required a district court to give express\r\nnotice of its intention to convert if the surrounding circumstances\r\neffectively place the parties on notice that the court has the\r\noption of treating the motion as a motion for summary judgment and\r\nthe parties have been given \"reasonable opportunity to present all\r\nmaterial made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56.\"  Id. (quoting\r\nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)); see also Chaparro-Febus v. International\r\nLongshoremen Ass'n, Local 1575, 983 F.2d 325, 332 (1st Cir. 1992)\r\n(treating failure to give express notice of conversion as harmless\r\nerror).\r\nHere, the circumstances surrounding the conversion of\r\ndefendants' motion to dismiss were sufficiently clear to\r\neffectively place C.B. Trucking on notice that the district court\r\nintended to treat the motion as a motion for summary judgment. \r\nRather than relying on defendants' assertion that the complaint\r\nfailed to sufficiently allege below-cost pricing, the district\r\ncourt signaled its intention to delve into the evidentiary\r\nsufficiency of C.B. Trucking's allegations by calling on the\r\nparties to submit affidavits addressing the issue.  Given the\r\ncourt's request for information that it could only consider\r\nconsistent with Rule 12(b) if it converted the motion to dismiss\r\ninto a motion for summary judgment, C.B. Trucking has no credible\r\nbasis to complain that it was unfairly surprised by the conversion.\r\nNor can C.B. Trucking claim that the conversion unfairly\r\ndeprived it of the opportunity to submit responsive materials on\r\nthe below-cost pricing issue.  The case had been pending for more\r\nthan a year when the district court called on the parties to submit\r\naffidavits on the pricing issue.  Moreover, C.B. Trucking was given\r\nmore than a month to prepare and file affidavits responding to\r\nWaste Management's denial that it had engaged in below-cost\r\npricing.  Under these circumstances, the district court acted well\r\nwithin its discretion in treating the motion to dismiss as a motion\r\nfor summary judgment. \r\n                      B.\r\nC.B. Trucking alternatively claims, based on Fed. R. Civ.\r\nP. 56(f), that the district court should have refrained from ruling\r\non the converted summary judgment motion so that it could have\r\nconducted discovery on the below-cost pricing issue.  We review the\r\ndistrict court's decision to proceed to the merits of the summary\r\njudgment question for abuse of discretion.  See Morrissey v. Boston\r\nFive Cents Sav. Bank, 54 F.3d 27, 35 (1st Cir. 1995).\r\nWhen properly invoked, Rule 56(f) allows a party opposing\r\nsummary judgment additional time to conduct discovery on matters\r\nrelated to the motion.  See Resolution Trust Corp. v. North Bridge\r\nAssociates, Inc., 22 F.3d 1198, 1203 (1st Cir. 1994).  To benefit\r\nfrom the rule, however, a party must meet several requirements. \r\nFirst, although a request for Rule 56(f) relief need not be\r\nexpressly labeled as such, the party invoking the rule at a minimum\r\nmust ask the court to refrain from acting on the summary judgment\r\nrequest until additional discovery can be conducted.  See Ayala-\r\nGerena v. Bristol Myers-Squibb Co., 95 F.3d 86, 92 (1st Cir. 1996);\r\nDow v. United Bhd. of Carpenters, 1 F.3d 56, 61 (1st Cir. 1993). \r\nIn other words, a party ordinarily may not attempt to meet a\r\nsummary judgment challenge head-on but fall back on Rule 56(f) if\r\nits first effort is unsuccessful.  Second, a party relying on Rule\r\n56(f) must demonstrate that it was diligent in pursuing discovery\r\nbefore the summary judgment initiative surfaced.  See Ayala-Gerena,\r\n95 F.3d at 92 (\"Rule 56(f) is designed to minister to the vigilant,\r\nnot to those who slumber upon perceptible rights.\").  Finally, the\r\nparty must \"set forth a plausible basis for believing that\r\nspecified facts, susceptible of collection within a reasonable time\r\nframe, probably exist\" and \"indicate how the emergent facts, if\r\nadduced, will influence the outcome of the pending summary judgment\r\nmotion.\"  Resolution Trust Corp., 22 F.3d at 1203.  C.B. Trucking\r\ncannot satisfy any of these requirements.  \r\nThe only reference C.B. Trucking made in district court\r\nto the need for additional discovery was a comment in its\r\nopposition to Waste Management's affidavit in which the company's\r\nattorney stated, \"[a]ccordingly, this court should deny the\r\ndefendants' motion and at a minimum allow the plaintiff discovery\r\non the issue of cost.\"  C.B. Trucking accompanied its opposition\r\nwith an affidavit from its president attempting to address the\r\nbelow-cost issue on its merits.  Because it is apparent from the\r\nopposition and the supporting affidavit that C.B. Trucking was\r\ncontent to have the court act on the merits of the motion, its\r\npassing comment that the court should deny the motion so that the\r\nparties could conduct additional discovery is simply not sufficient\r\nto trigger Rule 56(f).  \r\nRule 56(f) relief was also unjustified because C.B.\r\nTrucking was not diligent in pursuing discovery.  Although C.B.\r\nTrucking acknowledges that a plaintiff in a predatory pricing case\r\nmust prove that the prices a plaintiff complains of were below its\r\ncompetitor's costs, see Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown &amp; Williamson\r\nTobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 223-26 (1993), the company conducted\r\nno discovery on this issue during the twenty-one months in which\r\nthis case was pending in the district court.  Given this failure,\r\nC.B. Trucking is in no position to complain of the court's decision\r\nto examine the evidentiary sufficiency of the predatory pricing\r\nclaim.\r\nFinally, further delay in the resolution of Waste\r\nManagement's motion was unwarranted because C.B. Trucking failed to\r\nidentify any material evidence that it was likely to uncover if it\r\nwas given additional time to conduct discovery.  As this court has\r\nrecognized, a plaintiff's speculative assertions that the defendant\r\nhas unspecified facts in its possession necessary for the plaintiff\r\nto develop its legal theories coupled with conclusory statements\r\nthat discovery should be commenced are \"entirely inadequate to\r\nextract the balm of Rule 56(f).\"  Paterson-Leitch Co. v.\r\nMassachusetts Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co., 840 F.2d 985, 989 (1st Cir.\r\n1988).  At best, C.B. Trucking made a non-specific request that the\r\ncourt deny the motion so that it could conduct additional\r\ndiscovery.  This type of general and unsupported statement will not\r\nsatisfy Rule 56(f).  Accordingly, the district court was well\r\nwithin its discretion in proceeding to the merits of the summary\r\njudgment motion. \r\n                      C.\r\nHaving determined that the district court had the\r\ndiscretion to rule on defendants' converted summary judgment motion\r\nwithout giving C.B. Trucking express notice or additional time to\r\nconduct discovery, we have little difficulty in concluding that the\r\ncourt properly disposed of the predatory pricing claim. \r\nA plaintiff cannot prevail on a predatory pricing claim\r\nunless it proves that the prices it complains of are below its\r\ncompetitor's costs.  See Brooke Group Ltd., 509 U.S. at 223-26. \r\nFurther, we have recognized that a company that \"prices its own\r\nproduct or service at or above its own costs does not violate the\r\nSherman Act merely because its costs, and thus its prices, are\r\nlower than a rival's costs.\"  Tri-State Rubbish, Inc. v. Waste\r\nManagement, Inc., 998 F.2d 1073, 1080 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\nDefendants challenged C.B. Trucking's ability to prove\r\nits predatory pricing claims by filing an affidavit of the employee\r\nwho prepared the bids and managed the contracts at issue, stating\r\nthat Waste Management had not lost money on any of the contracts. \r\nThis assertion was sufficient to compel C.B. Trucking to come\r\nforward with enough competent evidence to permit a reasonable\r\nfactfinder to conclude that Waste Management had engaged in below-\r\ncost pricing.  See LeBlanc v. Great American Ins. Co., 6 F.3d 836,\r\n842 (1st Cir. 1993).  Rather than attempting to counter defendants'\r\nassertion with hard evidence, however, C.B. Trucking offered only\r\nits president's statement that Waste Management must have engaged\r\nin below-cost pricing because its bids exceeded C.B. Trucking's\r\ncosts.  Conclusory statements of this type are insufficient to\r\nsustain a predatory pricing claim in the face of a properly\r\nsupported summary judgment motion.  Consequently, based on the\r\nrecord the parties presented, we agree with the district court's\r\ndecision to summarily dispose of C.B. Trucking's predatory pricing\r\nclaim.\r\n                     III.\r\nFor the reasons discussed above, we find that the\r\ndistrict court properly granted summary judgment against plaintiff.\r\nAccordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.  \n",

Under these circumstances, the district court acted well within its discretion in treating the motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.B. Trucking alternatively claims, based on Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f), that the district court should have refrained from ruling on the converted summary judgment motion so that it could have conducted discovery on the below-cost pricing issue.  We review the district court's decision to proceed to the merits of the summary judgment question for abuse of discretion.  See Morrissey v. Boston Five Cents Sav. Bank, 54 F.3d 27, 35 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When properly invoked, Rule 56(f) allows a party opposing summary judgment additional time to conduct discovery on matters related to the motion.  See Resolution Trust Corp. v. North Bridge Associates, Inc., 22 F.3d 1198, 1203 (1st Cir.1994).  To benefit from the rule, however, a party must meet several requirements.  First, although a request for Rule 56(f) relief need not be expressly labeled as such, the party invoking the rule at a minimum must ask the court to refrain from acting on the summary judgment request until additional discovery can be conducted.  See Ayala-Gerena v. Bristol Myers-Squibb Co., 95 F.3d 86, 92 (1st Cir.1996);  Dow v. United Bhd. of Carpenters, 1 F.3d 56, 61 (1st Cir.1993).  In other words, a party ordinarily may not attempt to meet a summary judgment challenge head-on but fall back on Rule 56(f) if its first effort is unsuccessful.  Second, a party relying on Rule 56(f) must demonstrate that it was diligent in pursuing discovery before the summary judgment initiative surfaced.  See Ayala-Gerena, 95 F.3d at 92 (\"Rule 56(f) is designed to minister to the vigilant, not to those who slumber upon perceptible rights.\").  Finally, the party must \"set forth a plausible basis for believing that specified facts, susceptible of collection within a reasonable time frame, probably exist\" and \"indicate how the emergent facts, if adduced, will influence the outcome of the pending summary judgment motion.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-2\" id=\"fn2-2_ref\">2</a>  Resolution Trust Corp., 22 F.3d at 1203.   C.B. Trucking cannot satisfy any of these requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only reference C.B. Trucking made in district court to the need for additional discovery was a comment in its opposition to Waste Management's affidavit in which the company's attorney stated, \"[a]ccordingly, this court should deny the defendants' motion and at a minimum allow the plaintiff discovery on the issue of cost.\"   C.B. Trucking accompanied its opposition with an affidavit from its president attempting to address the below-cost issue on its merits.  Because it is apparent from the opposition and the supporting affidavit that C.B. Trucking was content to have the court act on the merits of the motion, its passing comment that the court should deny the motion so that the parties could conduct additional discovery is simply not sufficient to trigger Rule 56(f).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 56(f) relief was also unjustified because C.B. Trucking was not diligent in pursuing discovery.  Although C.B. Trucking acknowledges that a plaintiff in a predatory pricing case must prove that the prices a plaintiff complains of were below its competitor's costs, see Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 223-26, 113 S.Ct. 2578, 2587-90, 125 L.Ed.2d 168 (1993), the company conducted no discovery on this issue during the twenty-one months in which this case was pending in the district court.  Given this failure, C.B. Trucking is in no position to complain of the court's decision to examine the evidentiary sufficiency of the predatory pricing claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, further delay in the resolution of Waste Management's motion was unwarranted because C.B. Trucking failed to identify any material evidence that it was likely to uncover if it was given additional time to conduct discovery.  As this court has recognized, a plaintiff's speculative assertions that the defendant has unspecified facts in its possession necessary for the plaintiff to develop its legal theories coupled with conclusory statements that discovery should be commenced are \"entirely inadequate to extract the balm of Rule 56(f).\"  Paterson-Leitch Co. v. Massachusetts Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co., 840 F.2d 985, 989 (1st Cir.1988).  At best, C.B. Trucking made a non-specific request that the court deny the motion so that it could conduct additional discovery.  This type of general and unsupported statement will not satisfy Rule 56(f).  Accordingly, the district court was well within its discretion in proceeding to the merits of the summary judgment motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having determined that the district court had the discretion to rule on defendants' converted summary judgment motion without giving C.B. Trucking express notice or additional time to conduct discovery, we have little difficulty in concluding that the court properly disposed of the predatory pricing claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A plaintiff cannot prevail on a predatory pricing claim unless it proves that the prices it complains of are below its competitor's costs.  See Brooke Group Ltd., 509 U.S. at 223-26, 113 S.Ct. at 2587-90.   Further, we have recognized that a company that \"prices its own product or service at or above its own costs does not violate the Sherman Act merely because its costs, and thus its prices, are lower than a rival's costs.\"  Tri-State Rubbish, Inc. v. Waste Management, Inc., 998 F.2d 1073, 1080 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants challenged C.B. Trucking's ability to prove its predatory pricing claims by filing an affidavit of the employee who prepared the bids and managed the contracts at issue, stating that Waste Management had not lost money on any of the contracts.  This assertion was sufficient to compel C.B. Trucking to come forward with enough competent evidence to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that Waste Management had engaged in below-cost pricing.  See LeBlanc v. Great American Ins. Co., 6 F.3d 836, 842 (1st Cir.1993).  Rather than attempting to counter defendants' assertion with hard evidence, however, C.B. Trucking offered only its president's statement that Waste Management must have engaged in below-cost pricing because its bids exceeded C.B. Trucking's costs.  Conclusory statements of this type are insufficient to sustain a predatory pricing claim in the face of a properly supported summary judgment motion.  Consequently, based on the record the parties presented, we agree with the district court's decision to summarily dispose of C.B. Trucking's predatory pricing claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons discussed above, we find that the district court properly granted summary judgment against plaintiff.

Trucking, Inc. brought this action against Waste Management of Massachusetts, Inc. and its parent, WMX Technologies, Inc., alleging, among other things, that defendants had illegally attempted to monopolize the residential solid waste collection business in southeastern Massachusetts through a practice of predatory pricing.  Treating defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim as a motion for summary judgment, the district court summarily disposed of the predatory pricing claims.  On appeal, C.B. Trucking asserts that the district court erred because it:  (1) failed to properly notify the parties of its intention to convert the motion into a motion for summary judgment;  (2) ruled on the motion without giving C.B. Trucking an opportunity to conduct discovery;  and (3) granted summary judgment even though facts material to the motion remained in genuine dispute.  We reject these arguments and affirm the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.B. Trucking is a family-owned company that operates a residential solid waste collection business in southeastern Massachusetts.  From 1990 through 1994, the company collected residential solid waste in Franklin and Medway, Massachusetts, pursuant to contracts with those towns.  In 1994, after a process of public bidding, Franklin and Medway, as well as the nearby town of Norton, Massachusetts, awarded Waste Management exclusive residential solid waste collection contracts.  In securing these contracts, Waste Management outbid not only local operators such as C.B. Trucking, but also national operators such as Browning-Ferris Industries and Laidlaw Waste Systems, Inc. Each contract was for a three-year term and required Waste Management to perform specified collection services for a fixed price during the contract term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Waste Management's bids for the Medway and Norton contracts were lower than the next lowest bids by approximately $40,000 in each case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-2\" id=\"fn1-2_ref\">1</a>  The company's final bid for the Franklin contract at $1.58 million came in under C.B. Trucking's final bid by only about $4000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.B. Trucking brought this action against Waste Management and WMX Technologies asserting that defendants had:  (1) violated the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.A. &#167;&#167; 1, 2 (West 1997), by attempting to monopolize the residential solid waste business in southeastern Massachusetts through a practice of predatory pricing;  (2) violated the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C.A. &#167;&#167; 13, 13a (West 1997), by engaging in predatory pricing;  (3) intentionally interfered with existing contracts between C.B. Trucking and the towns of Franklin and Medway in violation of Massachusetts law;  and (4) engaged in unfair and deceptive business practices in violation of the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act, Mass.  Gen. Laws Ann. ch.  93A (West 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).  At a hearing on the motion, the district court asked Waste Management to submit an affidavit addressing the limited issue of whether its bids for the three contracts at issue were below its costs.  The court also advised C.B. Trucking that it could respond to Waste Management's affidavit as it saw fit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the hearing, Waste Management submitted an affidavit from the employee who had prepared its bids and managed the contracts at issue, stating that Waste Management had not lost money on any of the contracts.  The affidavit also alleged that Waste Management had lost out in bidding on other residential solid waste contracts in the same geographic area during the relevant time period, and that it currently faced competition in the area from approximately eighteen trash haulers.  After seeking and obtaining additional time to respond, C.B. Trucking countered with an affidavit from its president who concluded that Waste Management's bids must have been below its own costs because they were below C.B. Trucking's costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having solicited the affidavits, the court converted defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motion into a motion for summary judgment.  It then disposed of the predatory pricing claims by concluding that C.B. Trucking had failed to produce sufficient evidence that Waste Management had engaged in below-cost pricing to withstand summary judgment.  It also declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims.  On appeal, C.B. Trucking contests only the dismissal of its Sherman Act predatory pricing claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.B. Trucking first asserts that the district court erred because it never expressly notified the parties of its intention to convert defendants' motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment.  Had the court done so, C.B. Trucking contends, it would have sought additional time to conduct discovery in order to gather the evidence needed to withstand the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 12(b) provides that a court shall convert a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim into one for summary judgment if \"matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b).  We employ a functional approach to the conversion process.  See Rodrguez v. Fullerton Tires Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197406\"><a href=\"/opinion/197406/alers-rodriguez-v-national-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span>, 83 (1st Cir.1997).  Accordingly, we have not required a district court to give express notice of its intention to convert if the surrounding circumstances effectively place the parties on notice that the court has the option of treating the motion as a motion for summary judgment and the parties have been given \"reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56.\"  Id. (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b));  see also Chaparro-Febus v. International Longshoremen Ass'n, Local 1575, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597803\"><a href=\"/opinion/597803/miguel-angel-chaparro-febus-v-international-longshoremen-association/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span>, 332 (1st Cir.1992) (treating failure to give express notice of conversion as harmless error).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the circumstances surrounding the conversion of defendants' motion to dismiss were sufficiently clear to effectively place C.B. Trucking on notice that the district court intended to treat the motion as a motion for summary judgment.  Rather than relying on defendants' assertion that the complaint failed to sufficiently allege below-cost pricing, the district court signaled its intention to delve into the evidentiary sufficiency of C.B. Trucking's allegations by calling on the parties to submit affidavits addressing the issue.  Given the court's request for information that it could only consider consistent with Rule 12(b) if it converted the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment, C.B. Trucking has no credible basis to complain that it was unfairly surprised by the conversion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor can C.B. Trucking claim that the conversion unfairly deprived it of the opportunity to submit responsive materials on the below-cost pricing issue.  The case had been pending for more than a year when the district court called on the parties to submit affidavits on the pricing issue.  Moreover, C.B. Trucking was given more than a month to prepare and file affidavits responding to Waste Management's denial that it had engaged in below-cost pricing.  Under these circumstances, the district court acted well within its discretion in treating the motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.B.

Trucking is in no position to complain of the court's decision to examine the evidentiary sufficiency of the predatory pricing claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, further delay in the resolution of Waste Management's motion was unwarranted because C.B. Trucking failed to identify any material evidence that it was likely to uncover if it was given additional time to conduct discovery.  As this court has recognized, a plaintiff's speculative assertions that the defendant has unspecified facts in its possession necessary for the plaintiff to develop its legal theories coupled with conclusory statements that discovery should be commenced are \"entirely inadequate to extract the balm of Rule 56(f).\"  Paterson-Leitch Co. v. Massachusetts Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"502424\"><a href=\"/opinion/502424/paterson-leitch-company-inc-v-massachusetts-municipal-wholesale-electric/\"><span class=\"volume\">840</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">985</span></a></span>, 989 (1st Cir.1988).  At best, C.B. Trucking made a non-specific request that the court deny the motion so that it could conduct additional discovery.  This type of general and unsupported statement will not satisfy Rule 56(f).  Accordingly, the district court was well within its discretion in proceeding to the merits of the summary judgment motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having determined that the district court had the discretion to rule on defendants' converted summary judgment motion without giving C.B. Trucking express notice or additional time to conduct discovery, we have little difficulty in concluding that the court properly disposed of the predatory pricing claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A plaintiff cannot prevail on a predatory pricing claim unless it proves that the prices it complains of are below its competitor's costs.  See Brooke Group Ltd., 509 U.S. at 223-26, 113 S.Ct. at 2587-90.   Further, we have recognized that a company that \"prices its own product or service at or above its own costs does not violate the Sherman Act merely because its costs, and thus its prices, are lower than a rival's costs.\"  Tri-State Rubbish, Inc. v. Waste Management, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"611561\"><a href=\"/opinion/611561/tri-state-rubbish-inc-v-waste-management-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1073</span></a></span>, 1080 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants challenged C.B. Trucking's ability to prove its predatory pricing claims by filing an affidavit of the employee who prepared the bids and managed the contracts at issue, stating that Waste Management had not lost money on any of the contracts.  This assertion was sufficient to compel C.B. Trucking to come forward with enough competent evidence to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that Waste Management had engaged in below-cost pricing.  See LeBlanc v. Great American Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"654585\"><a href=\"/opinion/654585/theodore-l-leblanc-v-great-american-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">836</span></a></span>, 842 (1st Cir.1993).  Rather than attempting to counter defendants' assertion with hard evidence, however, C.B. Trucking offered only its president's statement that Waste Management must have engaged in below-cost pricing because its bids exceeded C.B. Trucking's costs.  Conclusory statements of this type are insufficient to sustain a predatory pricing claim in the face of a properly supported summary judgment motion.  Consequently, based on the record the parties presented, we agree with the district court's decision to summarily dispose of C.B. Trucking's predatory pricing claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons discussed above, we find that the district court properly granted summary judgment against plaintiff.  Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eleventh Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s-s_ref\">**</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-2_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The bids for the Medway contract were as follows:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\">1</a>\n        <p> Browning-Ferris $228,000</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2-2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Laidlaw $220,000</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\">3</a>\n        <p> C.B.
