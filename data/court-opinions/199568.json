Like the contaminated property\n\nthat    gave    rise   to   it,   the   case    before   us   demands   careful\n\nhandling.        The pivotal question, heretofore untouched by any\n\nappellate court, is whether the automatic stay provision of the\n\nBankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 362(a), prevents a state from\n\nsimultaneously         creating    and     perfecting     an     environmental\n\nsuperlien on a debtor's property after the institution of a\n\nbankruptcy       proceeding.      Both    the   bankruptcy     court    and   the\n\ndistrict court answered this surpassingly close question in the\n\nnegative, holding that the environmental superlien evades the\n\ngrasp of the automatic stay.             We affirm.\n\nI.     BACKGROUND\n\n               The debtor, 229 Main Street Limited Partnership, owns\n\na shopping plaza on Main Street in Natick, Massachusetts (the\n\nProperty).       For many years, a dry cleaning business leased space\n\nin the plaza.          As a result, the Property became profoundly\n\ncontaminated with chemicals and other pollutants.                 In time, the\n\nMassachusetts       Department     of     Environmental       Protection      (the\n\nCommonwealth) concluded that contamination from the Property\n\nposed a dire threat to drinking water in the town of Natick.                    To\n\navert this threat, the Commonwealth spent large sums of money on\n\nemergency cleanup activities.            It then sought reimbursement for\n\nthese expenses, along with assurances in respect to anticipated\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\ffuture    expenditures,        from        the    debtor.        Moreover,        the\n\nCommonwealth informed the debtor, by letter dated November 5,\n\n1998, that it intended to record a lien against the Property to\n\nsecure present and future cleanup costs.                    See Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch. 21E, § 13 (the environmental superlien statute).\n\n             Initially, the debtor denied responsibility for the\n\ncontamination       and    contested        the   dollar       amount    that     the\n\nCommonwealth placed on cleanup costs.                Accordingly, it demanded\n\nan adjudicatory hearing.        See 310 C.M.R. § 40.1254.               The hearing\n\nmoved slowly.       Before it concluded, the debtor filed a voluntary\n\npetition under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §§\n\n1101-1174.        By the debtor's own admission, a principal reason\n\nbehind this filing was a desire to avoid perfection of the\n\nCommonwealth's lien.         To that extent, the maneuver failed; the\n\nhearing officer ruled that the environmental superlien statute\n\nfell within an exception to the automatic stay and refused to\n\nadjourn the administrative proceeding.\n\n             The debtor countered by asking the bankruptcy court to\n\nhold   the    Commonwealth     in   contempt       for   continuing       to    press\n\nforward      in   the   postpetition       period.       The   bankruptcy       court\n\nrefused the debtor's request.               When the debtor appealed, the\n\ndistrict court followed suit, ruling that the automatic stay did\n\nnot    preclude     continuation      of    the   proceedings      necessary       to\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fperfect the Commonwealth's environmental superlien.                    See 229\n\nMain St. Ltd. P'ship v. Mass. Dep't of Envt'l Prot., 251 B.R.\n\n186, 193 (D. Mass. 2000).         This appeal ensued.              Because its\n\nresolution turns on questions of statutory interpretation, we\n\nexercise plenary review.        See Soares v. Brockton Credit Union\n\n(In re Soares), 107 F.3d 969, 973 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\nII.     THE STATUTES\n\n            As this case perches at a crossroads formed by the\n\nintersection of federal and state law, we set out the pieces of\n\nthe statutory puzzle before attempting to fit them together.                   We\n\nbegin with familiar fare:        the automatic stay provision.\n\n            The automatic stay, 11 U.S.C. § 362(a), is one of the\n\nfundamental protections afforded to debtors by the bankruptcy\n\nlaws.    Midatlantic Nat'l Bank v. N.J. Dep't of Envt'l Prot., 474\n\nU.S. 494, 503 (1986).           It gives debtors breathing room by\n\nstopping collection efforts in their tracks and permitting their\n\nresumption only when the stay is lifted by the bankruptcy court\n\nor dissolved by operation of law.           Soares, 107 F.3d at 975.           To\n\naccomplish     these   objectives,    the    statute       provides   that   the\n\nfiling    of   a   bankruptcy   petition      halts    a    wide   variety     of\n\nspecified creditor activities.             See 11 U.S.C. § 362(a).           This\n\nappeal does not require us to call the roll.                  It suffices for\n\npresent purposes to note that the stay applies, inter alia, to\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f\"any       act   to   create,     perfect,       or   enforce           any   lien   against\n\nproperty of the estate.\"              Id. § 362(a)(4).\n\n                 While the automatic stay is an important part of the\n\nbankruptcy         protection      framework,         it      is    not       an   absolute.\n\nCongress has crafted certain exceptions to the automatic stay.\n\nSee id. § 362(b).                One of them, pertinent here, makes the\n\nautomatic         stay    inapplicable      to    \"any     act     to     perfect,    or    to\n\nmaintain or continue the perfection of, an interest in property\n\nto the extent that the [bankruptcy] trustee's rights and powers\n\nare subject to such perfection under section 546(b) of [the\n\nBankruptcy Code].\"           Id. § 362(b)(3).            The companion statute, 11\n\nU.S.C. § 546(b), limits the debtor's powers to avoid statutory\n\nliens1 by providing that they \"are subject to any generally\n\napplicable         law    that    permits    perfection            of    an    interest     in\n\nproperty to be effective against an entity that acquires rights\n\nin   such        property    before   the     date       of   perfection.\"            Id.    §\n\n546(b)(1)(A).            Thus, sections 362(b)(3) and 546(b)(1)(A), read\n\ntogether, plot the boundaries of the exception to the automatic\n\nstay which is at issue here.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n     Many of these statutes refer to the trustee in bankruptcy,\nacting in the debtor's stead. For simplicity's sake, we refer\nthroughout to debtors (although such references encompass\ntrustees wherever applicable).\n\n                                            -6-\n\f            To this point, we have been discussing relevant federal\n\nstatutes.    But this appeal also involves a state environmental\n\nsuperlien statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21E, § 13 (formally known\n\nas the Massachusetts Oil and Hazardous Material Prevention Act).\n\nThe state legislature designed this statute to assure the prompt\n\nand efficient cleanup of hazardous materials.2    Acme Laundry Co.\n\nv. Sec'y of Envt'l Affairs, 575 N.E.2d 1086, 1089 (Mass. 1991).\n\nIt provides in pertinent part that once the Commonwealth spends\n\nmoney assessing or cleaning up a polluted tract of land, it may\n\nplace a priority lien on that property:\n\n            Any liability to the commonwealth [for\n            cleanup costs] shall constitute a debt to\n            the commonwealth. Any such debt . . . shall\n            constitute a lien on all property owned by\n            persons liable under this chapter when a\n            statement of claim naming such persons is\n            recorded, registered or filed. . . .     Any\n            lien recorded, registered or filed pursuant\n            to this section shall have priority over any\n            encumbrance theretofore recorded, registered\n            or filed with respect to any site . . .\n            described in such statement of claim.\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 21E, § 13.\n\n\n\n    2At least two Justices of the United States Supreme Court\nhave signaled support for such state initiatives.            See\nMidatlantic Nat'l Bank, 474 U.S. at 517 (Rehnquist, J.,\ndissenting) (\"States retain considerable latitude to ensure that\npriority status is allotted to their cleanup claims.\"); Ohio v.\nKovacs, 469 U.S. 274, 286 (1985) (O'Connor, J., concurring)\n(suggesting that \"a State may protect its interest in the\nenforcement of its environmental laws by giving cleanup\njudgments the status of statutory liens or secured claims\").\n\n                                -7-\n\f            The    question       here       is        whether        the      environmental\n\nsuperlien    fits    within      the     exception            described         in   sections\n\n362(b)(3) and 546(b) of the Bankruptcy Code.                             The debtor argues\n\nthat the superlien falls outside the narrow boundaries of the\n\nexception    and    thus     succumbs        to        the    automatic         stay.       The\n\nCommonwealth demurs, maintaining that its superlien comes within\n\nthe safe harbor dredged by the exception and thus evades the\n\nautomatic stay.          In the pages that follow, we examine these\n\ndueling interpretations.\n\n\n\nIII.   THE STATUTES IN ACTION\n\n            Eligibility         for    the        pertinent          exception       to     the\n\nautomatic stay depends upon the existence                                vel non of three\n\nelements:        there   must    be    (1)        an    \"act        to   perfect\"     (2)   an\n\n\"interest in property\" (3) under circumstances in which the\n\nperfection-authorizing          statute       fits           within      the    contours     of\n\nsection 546(b)(1)(A).           We deal with the first two elements in\n\nPart III(A), reserving the third for discussion in Part III(B).\n\n                           A.    Section 362(b)(3).\n\n            In parsing section 362(b)(3), we alter the natural\n\nprogression:        because      the   question              of   what      constitutes     an\n\ninterest    in    property      is    crucial          to     the    resolution       of    the\n\nquestions that follow — both section 362(b)(3) and section\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\f546(b)(1)(A) contain an \"interest in property\" requirement — we\n\nbegin there.\n\n                  1.   \"Interest in property.\"           The threshold question is\n\nwhether the Commonwealth had a prepetition interest in the\n\nProperty.3         Although the parties are at loggerheads on a variety\n\nof   issues,           they   are   in   perfect    harmony      on   two   important\n\npreliminary matters.                First, the debtor acknowledges at this\n\npoint        in    the    proceedings      that     it     was   indebted    to   the\n\nCommonwealth under chapter 21E.                   This is as it should be, for\n\nMassachusetts law makes it pellucid that once the Commonwealth\n\nexpends any funds in connection with the assessment or cleanup\n\nof   a       contaminated      property,    a    debt     is   created.     See   Acme\n\nLaundry, 575 N.E.2d at 1090.               Second, it is beyond cavil that at\n\nthe time the debtor sought the protection of the bankruptcy\n\ncourt, the Commonwealth had not recorded a lien against the\n\nProperty.\n\n                  These agreed facts bring us to the crucial question:\n\nDid the Commonwealth have an interest in the Property at the\n\ntime the debtor filed its bankruptcy petition?                        On that issue,\n\n\n         3\n     The Commonwealth advances the argument that an interest in\nproperty need not arise prior to the filing of a bankruptcy\npetition in order to qualify for consideration under section\n362(b)(3).    Because we find that the Commonwealth had a\nprepetition interest in the Property, see text infra, we need\nnot reach the question of whether a postpetition interest,\nstanding alone, could satisfy this element of the test.\n\n                                           -9-\n\fthe   harmony    dissipates.           The    debtor       contends    that    section\n\n362(b)(3)'s     \"interest       in    property\"       requirement      only    can    be\n\nsatisfied by the existence, prepetition, of a lien; and that,\n\nsince no such lien was of record when the bankruptcy court's\n\njurisdiction attached, the Commonwealth had no interest in the\n\nProperty (and, therefore, cannot qualify for the balm of section\n\n362(b)(3)).       The   Commonwealth          sings    a    different       tune.     It\n\nasserts that the term \"interest in property,\" as used in section\n\n362(b)(3), is broader than the term \"lien\"; and that it had a\n\nprepetition interest in the Property arising out of a medley of\n\nfactors, including its expenditures for cleanup, its right to\n\nrecord a superlien, its notice to the debtor that it intended to\n\nrecord   such     a     lien,        and     its   taking       of    all     possible\n\nadministrative steps toward recordation.\n\n          We conclude that the term \"interest in property\" is not\n\nsynonymous      with    the     term       \"lien.\"         In   arriving      at    this\n\nconclusion, we look first to the plain language of section\n\n362(b)(3).      See Boivin v. Black, 225 F.3d 36, 40 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(explaining that all statutory analysis must begin with the\n\nlanguage of the particular statute sub judice).                      The language of\n\nan unambiguous statute normally determines its meaning.                        Freytag\n\nv. Commissioner, 501 U.S. 868, 873 (1991);                       State of R.I. v.\n\nNarragansett Indian Tribe, 19 F.3d 685, 698 (1st Cir. 1994).                          It\n\n\n                                           -10-\n\ffollows inexorably that when a statute's plain language points\n\nin a single direction, an inquiring court ordinarily should look\n\nno further.       United States v. Hilario, 218 F.3d 19, 23 (1st\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 121 S. Ct. 572 (2000).                   These principles\n\napply here.\n\n              Congress is familiar with the word \"lien,\" and used\n\nthat word frequently in drafting the Bankruptcy Code.                     E.g., 11\n\nU.S.C. §§ 361(a), 364, 544(a), 545.                 It is an orthodox tenet of\n\nstatutory construction that \"where Congress includes particular\n\nlanguage in one section of a statute, but omits it in another\n\nsection of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress\n\nacts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or\n\nexclusion.\"       Duncan v. Walker, 121 S. Ct. 2120, 2125 (2001)\n\n(quoting Bates v. United States, 522 U.S. 23, 29-30 (1997)).\n\nHonoring this tenet, we ascribe considerable significance to the\n\nfact that section 362(b)(3) uses the term \"interest in property\"\n\nr a t h e r        t h a n          t h e      t e r m        \" l i e n . \"\n\n              Giving Congress's word choices their full effect is an\n\nespecially attractive option here.                   After all, the text of\n\nsection 362(b)(3) is straightforward and leads to a perfectly\n\nplausible      result.       That    makes    the    case   for   plain   meaning\n\nextremely compelling.           See Pritzker v. Yari, 42 F.3d 53, 67-68\n\n(1st   Cir.    1994)     (\"As   a   fundamental       principle    of   statutory\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fconstruction, we will not depart from, or otherwise embellish,\n\nthe language of a statute absent either undeniable textual\n\nambiguity or some other extraordinary consideration, such as the\n\nprospect of yielding a patently absurd result.\").   We therefore\n\nconclude that the term \"interest in property\" as used in section\n\n362(b)(3) is broader than the term \"lien.\"   Accord Lincoln Sav.\n\nBank v. Suffolk County Treasurer (In re Parr Meadows Racing\n\nAss'n), 880 F.2d 1540, 1548 (2d Cir. 1989) (finding that state's\n\ninterest in property dated from the assessment of real property\n\ntaxes rather than from the recordation of a tax lien);4 Maryland\n\nNat'l Bank v.

The reasoning of the Parr\nMeadows court nonetheless remains instructive, and we cite to\nthe opinion on that basis.\n\n                             -12-\n\fin property arose when employees performed services for the\n\ndebtor rather than when lien was created).\n\n            In an effort to force-feed its narrow construction of\n\nthe phrase \"interest in property,\" the debtor points out that\n\nthe Bankruptcy Code defines a lien as an \"interest in property\"\n\n(specifically, as an \"interest in property to secure payment of\n\na debt or performance of an obligation,\" 11 U.S.C. § 101(37)).\n\nBut the mere fact that a lien is one kind of interest in\n\nproperty does not mean that a lien is the only kind of interest\n\nin property recognized by section 362(b)(3).                Cf. Maryland\n\nGlass, 723 F.2d at 1141-42 (finding that the term \"interest in\n\nproperty,\" as used in 11 U.S.C. § 546(b), is not limited to\n\nliens).\n\n            Finally, the debtor adverts to decisions that have\n\nequated an interest in property under section 362(b)(3) with a\n\nlien.     E.g., Equibank, N.A. v. Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp.,\n\n884 F.2d 80, 85 (3d Cir. 1989) (equating \"interest in property\"\n\nwith    \"lien\"   in   context   of   real   property   taxes).         Withal,\n\n\"[p]roperty interests are created and defined by state law,\"\n\nButner v. United States, 440 U.S. 48, 55 (1979), and these cases\n\noften turn on differences in state law, e.g, CS First Boston\n\nMortgage    Capital    Corp.    v.   RV   Centennial   P'ship    (In    re   RV\n\nCentennial P'ship), 202 B.R. 774, 777 (Bankr. D. Colo. 1996)\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\f(distinguishing case from similar bankruptcy cases based upon\n\ndifferences in state property law).           The fact that \"interest in\n\nproperty\" and \"lien\" may be synonymous under the law of a\n\nparticular state or under a particular state statute does not\n\nrender the terms coextensive for purposes of the Bankruptcy\n\nCode.\n\n             That ends this phase of our inquiry.                We hold that\n\n\"interest in property,\" as that term is used in 11 U.S.C. §\n\n362(b)(3),     is   unequivalent    to,     and   broader   than,    the    term\n\n\"lien.\"     With that definitional building block in place, we move\n\nto    the   question   of     whether,   under    Massachusetts      law,     the\n\nCommonwealth had an interest in the Property.\n\n             The    parties     reasonably    assume     that,      under     the\n\nenvironmental superlien statute, a debt comes into being once\n\nthe Commonwealth has incurred expenses relating to the cleanup\n\nof a particular piece of property; the debt ripens into a lien\n\nwhen recorded; and recording the lien simultaneously perfects\n\nit.     See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21E, § 13.            But these reference\n\npoints have limited utility for purposes of our inquiry:                    after\n\nall, a section 13 debt is not an interest in property, see In re\n\nMicrofab, Inc., 105 B.R. 152, 159 n.10 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1989),\n\nand, as discussed above, the term \"lien\" cannot be employed as\n\na proxy for an \"interest in property.\"                 Thus, we search for\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fguidance beyond the four corners of the environmental superlien\n\nstatute.\n\n             In Acme Laundry, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial\n\nCourt (SJC) dealt extensively with the superlien statute.                   While\n\nthe court did not directly answer the question before us, its\n\ndiscussion is quite helpful.           For example, the SJC limned the\n\nstatute's     central   purpose:       to       assure   that   the    costs      of\n\nenvironmental cleanup are \"borne by those who are responsible\n\nfor the release because they own or owned the land or because\n\nthey caused the spill.\"         575 N.E.2d at 1089.             The importance\n\nthat the legislature attaches to this goal is illustrated by the\n\nsevere sanctions imposed on those who violate cleanup orders.\n\nSee   Mass.    Gen.   Laws   ch.   21E,     §    11    (providing     for   civil\n\npenalties, fines, and imprisonment). The SJC also made clear\n\nthat the liability created by the Commonwealth's expenditure of\n\nfunds is wide-ranging, encompassing future costs and immediately\n\ntriggering the right to record a lien.             Acme Laundry, 575 N.E.2d\n\nat 1090.\n\n             In this case, the debtor was liable to the Commonwealth\n\nfor   past    and   future   cleanup   costs;      the   Commonwealth       had    a\n\npresent right to record a lien on the Property; and it had set\n\nthat process in motion by notifying the debtor of its intentions\n\nand   participating     vigorously     in   the       administrative    hearing\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fprocess.   Viewing these facts through the prism of Acme Laundry,\n\nwe conclude, as did the district court, 229 Main St., 251 B.R.\n\nat 192, that this amalgam — the Commonwealth's expenditures,\n\ntogether with its notice of intent to record a lien and its\n\ntenacious pursuit of that lien through administrative channels\n\n— sufficed to satisfy section 362(b)(3)'s \"interest in property\"\n\nrequirement.\n\n           We   find     support    for       this   conclusion    in   the   only\n\nreported case directly in point.                In that case, In re Perona\n\nBros., Inc., 186 B.R. 833 (D.N.J. 1995), the district court\n\nconsidered the question of a state's prepetition interest in\n\nproperty   in   the    context     of    an    environmental      superlien     and\n\nconcluded that far less than what exists here was sufficient to\n\nestablish such an interest.               The court determined that New\n\nJersey obtained an interest in the debtor's property on the date\n\nthe   state     notified    the     debtor       that     it   would    place     a\n\nsuperpriority lien on the property if it had to commence the\n\ncleanup of toxic waste.       Id. at 839.            Although the state's only\n\nprepetition act was this notice — the totality of the state's\n\ncleanup efforts occurred postpetition, id. at 835 — the court\n\nfound that solitary act sufficient to establish an interest in\n\nthe property.      Id.     If the facts of Perona Bros. yielded an\n\n\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\finterest in property, then a fortiori, the facts of the instant\n\ncase can yield no less.\n\n           2.     \"Act to perfect.\"       We next turn to the \"act to\n\nperfect\"    requirement      of    section    362(b)(3).       When     the\n\nCommonwealth takes the step of recording under the environmental\n\nsuperlien statute, that act both creates and perfects its lien.\n\nSee Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21E, § 13.           The debtor points out that\n\nwhile the automatic stay applies to \"any act to create, perfect,\n\nor enforce,\" 11 U.S.C. § 362(a)(4), section 362(b)(3) only\n\nexempts    acts   to   perfect.5    Based    on   this   discrepancy,    it\n\nconcludes that an act which simultaneously creates and perfects\n\ncannot qualify for an exception to the automatic stay under\n\nsection 362(b)(3).\n\n           At first glance, there seems to be a deep division of\n\nauthority on this point — some bankruptcy courts permitting\n\nsimultaneous postpetition creation and perfection of an interest\n\nin property pursuant to section 362(b)(3) and others prohibiting\n\nsuch a step.      But this is not the issue that actually divides\n\nthose courts.     Instead, the courts split over the issue of what\n\nconstitutes an interest in property, and that divergence drives\n\n\n\n    5In terms, the statute also exempts acts to maintain and\ncontinue perfection. 11 U.S.C. § 362(b)(3). Those categories\nare irrelevant for present purposes (and, thus, we disregard\nthem).\n\n                                   -17-\n\fthe seeming disagreement over the status of \"creation plus\n\nperfection.\"      In other words, courts that hew to the proposition\n\nthat    \"interest       in    property\"    means    \"lien\"     do       not   allow\n\nsimultaneous postpetition creation and perfection of liens,\n\nwhile contrary-minded courts tend to hold the opposite.\n\n              This dichotomy makes perfect sense.            The availability\n\nof Section 362(b)(3) generally is thought to depend upon the\n\nexistence of a prepetition interest in property.                   See 3 Collier\n\non Bankruptcy ¶ 362.05[5] (Lawrence P. King ed., 15th ed. rev.\n\n2001) (\"Section 362(b)(3) does not authorize the creation of new\n\nrights or interests for the creditor.\").              But cf. supra note 3.\n\nIf the particular interest is a lien, that lien must be in place\n\nprepetition before section 362(b)(3) can come into play.                      An act\n\nthat both creates and perfects a lien postpetition cannot so\n\nqualify.      See, e.g., Louisville & Jefferson County Metro. Sewer\n\nDist. v. Excel Eng'g, Inc. (In re Excel Eng'g, Inc.), 224 B.R.\n\n582,   589-90    (Bankr.      W.D.   Ky.   1998)   (refusing       to    recognize\n\nvalidity of postpetition creation and perfection of mechanic's\n\nlien because creditor had no lien at the time debtor filed for\n\nbankruptcy); Watervliet Paper Co. v.

Such courts routinely read the section\n\n362(b)(3)     exception     to     leave       room    for       the   simultaneous\n\npostpetition     creation        and    perfection          of   liens    based    on\n\nprepetition interests in property.                    See, e.g., In re Summit\n\nVentures, Inc., 135 B.R. 483, 492 (Bankr. D. Vt. 1991) (allowing\n\npostpetition    creation    and        perfection      of    tax   lien   based   on\n\nprepetition interest in form of tax assessment); Jones & Lamson\n\nMach., 113 B.R. at 129 (permitting postpetition creation and\n\nperfection of mechanic's lien where plaintiffs' work for debtor\n\nconstituted their prepetition interest in property); see also\n\nParr Meadows, 880 F.2d at 1548 (upholding, without discussion,\n\nthe simultaneous postpetition creation and perfection of a tax\n\n\n                                        -19-\n\flien    for    section      362(b)(3)     purposes        where      the     county's\n\npreexisting tax assessment constituted a prepetition interest in\n\nthe property).\n\n              In our view, the plain language of section 362(b)(3)\n\nsuggests the answer to the question of whether the environmental\n\nsuperlien statute's simultaneous creation-plus-perfection model\n\nfits under the statutory umbrella.                  The statute provides in\n\npertinent part that the automatic stay does not apply to \"any\n\nact to perfect . . . an interest in property. . . .\"                       Bearing in\n\nmind that \"interest in property\" is broader than \"lien,\" see\n\nsupra   Part       III(A)(1),    this    language    appears         to    cover    the\n\nsimultaneous        creation    and   perfection     of    a   lien       based    on   a\n\nprepetition interest in property.              An act that both creates and\n\nperfects in one fell swoop is an act to perfect.                      Since section\n\n362(b)(3) says that the filing of a bankruptcy petition does not\n\nautomatically        stay   an    act    to    perfect,        the     simultaneous\n\npostpetition creation and perfection of a lien may come within\n\nthe pertinent exception to the automatic stay so long as the\n\ncreditor holds a valid prepetition interest in the property.\n\n              We    buttress     this   conclusion        with       two    practical\n\nobservations.         First, applying the debtor's interpretation —\n\nthat section 362(b)(3)'s use of the unembellished word \"perfect\"\n\nmeans that an act of combined creation and perfection remains\n\n\n                                        -20-\n\fsubject to the automatic stay — would lead to an absurd result.\n\nUnder the debtor's theory, an act that effected the concurrent\n\ncreation and perfection of a lien would, at one and the same\n\ntime, be both stayed (by section 362(a)(4)) and exempted from\n\nthe stay (by section 362(a)(3)).             We decline to indulge in so\n\nschizophrenic a reading of the Bankruptcy Code.\n\n           Second, statutory liens often are created and perfected\n\nby the same act.         Congress clearly intended section 546(b)'s\n\nlimitation   on    the     debtor's    avoidance    power   to       extend    to\n\nstatutory liens; after all, section 546(b) specifically refers\n\nto section 545, which deals with the avoidance of statutory\n\nliens.    Since Congress incorporated section 546(b) into the\n\nsection   362(b)(3)       exception,    it   is   logical   to   infer        that\n\nCongress intended that statutory liens would, at times, be\n\nexempt    from    the     automatic      stay.      Under      the     debtor's\n\ninterpretation, a significant class of statutory liens — those\n\nthat are created and perfected by the same act — would never be\n\nexempt from the automatic stay.          It seems difficult to reconcile\n\nthis outcome with Congress's discernible intent.\n\n           For    these    reasons,     we   conclude   that     the    act     of\n\nsimultaneous      creation    and      perfection   effectuated        by     the\n\nMassachusetts environmental superlien statute qualifies as an\n\n\"act to perfect\" under section 362(b)(3).\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\f                      B.   Section 546(b).\n\n         The Bankruptcy Code delineates the scope of a debtor's\n\npower to avoid certain creditor initiatives.    But this power is\n\ncircumscribed in certain respects.      Insofar as it applies to\n\nstatutory liens, this power cannot be exercised to curtail \"any\n\ngenerally applicable law that permits perfection of an interest\n\nin property to be effective against an entity that acquires\n\nrights in such property before the date of perfection.\"        11\n\nU.S.C. § 546(b)(1)(A).     The purpose of section 546(b) is to\n\n\"protect, in spite of the surprise intervention of a bankruptcy\n\npetition, those whom state law protects by allowing them to\n\nperfect their liens or interests as of an effective date that is\n\nearlier than the date of perfection.\"    H.R. Rep. No. 95-595, at\n\n371-72 (1978),   reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6327.      For a\n\nparticular creditor to reach the haven contemplated by section\n\n546(b)(1)(A), three elements must coalesce:     (1) the creditor\n\nmust act pursuant to a law of general applicability; (2) that\n\nlaw must allow the creditor to perfect an interest in property;\n\nand (3) such perfection must be effective against previously\n\nacquired rights in the property.\n\n         The first of these elements requires little discussion.\n\nFor a law to be \"generally applicable,\" it must apply to cases\n\nwithin and without the bankruptcy sphere.    See Makoroff v. City\n\n\n                              -22-\n\fof Lockport, 916 F.2d 890, 892 (3d Cir. 1990).              The debtor\n\nconcedes that the environmental superlien statute here at issue,\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 21E, § 13, satisfies this definition.            The\n\nremaining two elements require more detailed elaboration.             We\n\nconsolidate our discussion of them.\n\n           The debtor asserts that the superlien statute does not\n\npermit \"perfection of an interest in property to be effective\n\nagainst an entity that acquires rights in such property before\n\nthe date of perfection.\"       11 U.S.C. § 546(b)(1)(A).    To support\n\nthis assertion, it makes three claims:          that the Commonwealth\n\nheld no prepetition interest in the Property; that perfection\n\n(here, the act of recording) is a prerequisite to establishing\n\npriority, but no act of recordation ever occurred; and that only\n\nstate statutes that contain specific         \"relation back\" language\n\ncan come within the parameters of section 546(b).           We address\n\nthese claims sequentially.\n\n           Accepting for argument's sake the debtor's view that\n\nsection 546(b) requires a interest in property which arises\n\nprepetition, we nonetheless find the debtor's ipse dixit that\n\nthe Commonwealth had no prepetition interest in the Property\n\nforeclosed by our earlier determination that the Commonwealth in\n\nfact   enjoyed   such   a   prepetition   interest.   See   supra   Part\n\nIII(A)(1).   The debtor nimbly skips to another point — the lack\n\n\n                                  -23-\n\fof a section 13 lien on the Property.              To be sure, there is no\n\nsuch lien — but that fact does not support the conclusion that\n\nthe debtor draws from it.           The only reason that the Commonwealth\n\nhas not recorded a lien is that its efforts to convert its\n\ninterest   in   the    Property      into   a   full-blown    lien    have    been\n\nstalled by the debtor's demand for an adjudicative hearing.\n\nThis circumstance does not preclude us from resolving the issue\n\nof whether the environmental superlien statute measures up to\n\nthe specific requirements imposed by section 546(b)(1)(A).\n\n           Last, the debtor suggests, citing a snippet plucked\n\nfrom section 546(b)'s legislative history, that a state statute\n\nmust   explicitly      provide      that    perfection     relate    back    to    a\n\nprepetition     date    in    order    to   fit   within     the    safe    harbor\n\ncontemplated by section 546(b)(1)(A).              There are three reasons\n\nwhy we find this suggestion unconvincing.               The short response to\n\nit is that section 546(b)(1)(A) enunciates no such requirement,\n\nand courts cannot limit legislation by cavalierly conjuring up\n\nqualifications    that       the    legislature   has    either     eschewed      or\n\nneglected to consider.

That is the\n\ncase here.\n\n           The     sockdolager        is   that     the    excerpt    from     the\n\nlegislative history which the debtor hawks, read in context,\n\ndoes not contradict the statutory text.                   That excerpt states\n\nthat \"the rights granted under this subsection prevail over the\n\ntrustee only if the transferee has perfected the transfer in\n\naccordance with applicable law and the perfection relates back\n\nto a date that is before the commencement of the case.\"                      H.R.\n\nRep. No. 95-595, supra, at 371.                   Contrary to the debtor's\n\nimportunings, this sentence does not impose a specific relation-\n\nback requirement; it merely reiterates that, to qualify for the\n\nsafe harbor, the perfection must have a retroactive effect in\n\nthe sense that once an interest is perfected it will take\n\npriority over earlier perfected interests.                 See Klein v. Civale\n\n& Trovato, Inc. (In re Lionel Corp.), 29 F.3d 88, 93 (2d Cir.\n\n1994) (\"As long as an 'applicable law' authorizes perfection\n\nafter another party has acquired interests in the property, a\n\nlienor fits within the exception.\"); In re Albert, 206 B.R. 636,\n\n\n                                       -25-\n\f640 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1997) (explaining that, once perfected, a\n\nlien       that    takes   priority      over    earlier    liens    satisfies     the\n\nrequirements of section 546(b)(1)(A)); In re 1301 Conn.

D.D.C.    1990)    (noting      that\n\nsection 546(b) applies to any lien that takes precedence over an\n\nearlier perfected interest in the property).\n\n               The debtor has one more shot in its sling.                  It invites\n\nus   to     accord    decretory        significance    to    the    fact    that    the\n\nlegislative history mentions a section of the Uniform Commercial\n\nCode       which   contains      an    explicit   \"relation    back\"       provision,\n\nU.C.C. § 9-301(2),6 as an example of a statute that would find\n\nsanctuary in the safe harbor created by section 546(b)(1)(A).\n\nSee H.R. Rep. No. 95-595, supra, at 371.                           Using this as a\n\nspringboard, the debtor leaps to the conclusion that section\n\n546(b)(1)(A) implicitly requires that a qualifying state statute\n\ncontain an explicit \"relation back\" provision.                       This is simply\n\ntoo much of a stretch:                while U.C.C. § 9-301(2) is one example\n\nof a state statute that fits under the wide umbrella of section\n\n546(b)(1)(A), other types of statutes can find shelter there as\n\nwell.       The key is not relation back, but, rather, whether the\n\n\n\n       6\n     Under U.C.C. § 9-301(2) the perfection of a purchase money\nsecurity interest within a certain interval relates back to the\ndate upon which the interest was acquired.    See, e.g., In re\nFiorillo & Co., 19 B.R. 21, 23 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 1982).\n\n                                          -26-\n\fstatute    in   question    provides           for   an    interest     that,       once\n\nperfected, trumps earlier-filed claims.                     See Lionel Corp., 29\n\nF.3d at 93; Albert, 206 B.R. at 640; 1301 Conn. Ave. Assocs.,\n\n117 B.R. at 11.\n\n            The three cases that the debtor cites in support of its\n\nargument    that     section       546(b)(1)(A)           requires     an    explicit\n\nrelation-back       provision      —   Makoroff,      916    F.2d    890,     Shoreham\n\nPaper, 117 B.R. 274, and               In re Prichard Plaza Assocs. Ltd.\n\nP'ship, 84 B.R. 289 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1988) — are unhelpful.                           We\n\nreview them briefly.\n\n            Makoroff involved a situation in which local taxing\n\nauthorities claimed, pursuant to section 546(b)(1)(A), that they\n\nhad a right to a priority lien on the debtor's property to\n\nsecure     unpaid     property         taxes    accruing       after        bankruptcy\n\nproceedings had been instituted.                916 F.2d at 891.            The court\n\nfound section 546(b)(1)(A) inapplicable because the debt did not\n\nrelate back to any prepetition interest in the taxed property.\n\nId. at 893-96.      The case stands for the proposition that section\n\n546(b)(1)(A)     requires      a   prepetition        interest,       not     for   the\n\nproposition that a statute must contain an explicit relation-\n\nback provision to qualify under section 546(b)(1)(A).\n\n            Shoreham Paper is similarly inapposite.                     There, the\n\nbankruptcy court held that a tax lien created and perfected\n\n\n                                         -27-\n\fpostpetition did not come within the ambit of 546(b)(1)(A)\n\nbecause the lien did not relate back to a prepetition date.          117\n\nB.R. at 281.   The case states no rule requiring that a statute\n\nhave an explicit relation-back requirement, and moreover, it is\n\ndistinguishable on the ground that the actual amount of the tax\n\nwas determined, and the tax bill issued, after the taxpayer had\n\nfiled for bankruptcy.       See id. at 275-76.        This, the court\n\nfound, did not give rise to a prepetition interest.         Id. at 281.\n\n          We regard Prichard Plaza as an outlier.            There, the\n\nbankruptcy court coined an oddly suggestive phrase in construing\n\nsection   546(b)   as   applying   only   to   statutes   that   accorded\n\n\"retroactive priority effect.\"       84 B.R. at 301.      But it is not\n\nclear whether the court was advocating a strict requirement that\n\nqualifying state statutes must contain specific \"relation back\"\n\nlanguage; and, at any rate, a later case from the same court\n\nrepudiates such a requirement.       See Microfab, 105 B.R. at 158;\n\nsee also 1301 Conn. Ave. Assocs., 117 B.R. at 10-11 (rejecting\n\nthe idea that section 546(b) contains a strict retroactivity\n\nrequirement); cf. In re 1350 Piccard Ltd. P'ship, 148 B.R. 83,\n\n85 (Bankr. D.D.C. 1992) (concluding that any contrary suggestion\n\nin Prichard Plaza has been abrogated).\n\n          As opposed to these cases, we find more persuasive the\n\nview of the only other court of appeals to have addressed the\n\n\n                                   -28-\n\fprecise question.           In Lionel Corp., 29 F.3d at 93, the Second\n\nCircuit   discerned         \"nothing     in    §   546(b)     indicating   that   it\n\napplies only when the lienor fits within a 'relation-back'\n\nstatute.\"    We share this view and, accordingly, we hold that\n\nthere is no requirement that the \"generally applicable law\"\n\nreferenced in section 546(b) contain an explicit relation-back\n\nmechanism.\n\n            We now circle back to the original inquiry:                     whether\n\nthe Massachusetts environmental superlien statute meets the\n\nsecond and third of section 546(b)(1)(A)'s stated criteria, that\n\nis, whether it \"permits perfection of an interest in property to\n\nbe effective against an entity that acquires rights in such\n\nproperty before the date of perfection.\"                      The gist of section\n\n546(b)(1)(A) is that \"the filing of a bankruptcy petition does\n\nnot    prevent   the    holder      of    an       interest    in   property   from\n\nperfecting its interest if, absent the bankruptcy filing, the\n\ninterest holder could have perfected its interest against an\n\nentity acquiring rights in the property before the date of\n\nperfection.\"     5 Collier on Bankruptcy, supra, ¶ 546.03[2][a].\n\nIn this instance, the environmental superlien statute permits\n\nthe    perfection      of    an   interest         in   property    by   recording,\n\nregistering, or filing that interest.                   See Microfab, 105 B.R. at\n\n156.    Such perfection plainly is effective against entities\n\n\n                                         -29-\n\fwhich already had acquired rights in the property.                      See Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 21E, § 13 (\"Any lien recorded, registered or filed\n\npursuant    to     this    section   shall     have       priority      over    any\n\nencumbrance      theretofore     recorded,     registered        or    filed   with\n\nrespect to any site . . . described in such statement of\n\nclaim.\"); see also Microfab, 105 B.R. at 156 (explaining that\n\nthe Commonwealth's lien trumps all other encumbrances, no matter\n\nwhen filed).       These credentials satisfy section 546(b)(1)(A)'s\n\nthird   criterion,        see   Lionel     Corp.,    29   F.3d    at    93,     and,\n\ntherefore, the environmental superlien statute meets all the\n\neligibility       requirements       for     inclusion       within       section\n\n546(b)(1)(A).\n\nV.    CONCLUSION\n\n           We need go no further.            The statutory lien that the\n\nCommonwealth wishes to record meets the combined requirements of\n\nsection 362(b)(3) and 546(b)(1)(A) and therefore falls within\n\nthe   exception     to    the   automatic     stay    carved     out    by     those\n\n\n\n\n                                     -30-\n\fprovisions.7   Consequently, we uphold the decisions of the lower\n\ncourts.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n    7 In its appellate briefs, the debtor theorizes that placing\nenvironmental superliens outside the Bankruptcy Code's automatic\nstay provision frustrates congressional intent (and, therefore,\noffends the Supremacy Clause). Because this argument was not\nraised below, it is waived.         See Teamsters, Chauffeurs,\nWarehousemen & Helpers Union, Local No. 59 v. Superline Transp.\nCo., 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"If any principle is\nsettled in this circuit, it is that, absent the most\nextraordinary circumstances, legal theories not raised squarely\nin the lower court cannot be broached for the first time on\nappeal.\").   In any event, our conclusion that the superlien\nstatute falls within an exception created by federal law\nprecludes any persuasive argument that Congress intended\notherwise.\n\n                               -31-\n\f",

The pivotal question, heretofore untouched by any appellate court, is whether the automatic stay provision of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(a), prevents a state from simultaneously creating and perfecting an environmental superlien on a debtor's property after the institution of a bankruptcy proceeding. Both the bankruptcy court and the district court answered this surpassingly close question in the negative, holding that the environmental superlien evades the grasp of the automatic stay. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The debtor, 229 Main Street Limited Partnership, owns a shopping plaza on Main Street in Natick, Massachusetts (the Property). For many years, a dry cleaning business leased space in the plaza. As a result, the Property became profoundly contaminated with chemicals and other pollutants. In time, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (the Commonwealth) concluded that contamination from the Property posed a dire threat to drinking water in the town of Natick. To avert this threat, the Commonwealth spent large sums of money on emergency cleanup activities. It then sought reimbursement for these expenses, along with assurances in respect to anticipated future expenditures, from the debtor. Moreover, the Commonwealth informed the debtor, by letter dated November 5, 1998, that it intended to record a lien against the Property to secure present and future cleanup costs. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21E, &#167; 13 (the environmental superlien statute).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Initially, the debtor denied responsibility for the contamination and contested the dollar amount that the Commonwealth placed on cleanup costs. Accordingly, it demanded an adjudicatory hearing. See 310 C.M.R. &#167; 40.1254. The hearing moved slowly. Before it concluded, the debtor filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1101-1174. By the debtor's own admission, a principal reason behind this filing was a desire to avoid perfection of the Commonwealth's lien. To that extent, the maneuver failed; the hearing officer ruled that the environmental superlien statute fell within an exception to the automatic stay and refused to adjourn the administrative proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The debtor countered by asking the bankruptcy court to hold the Commonwealth in contempt for continuing to press forward in the postpetition period. The bankruptcy court refused the debtor's request. When the debtor appealed, the district court followed suit, ruling that the automatic stay did not preclude continuation of the proceedings necessary to perfect the Commonwealth's environmental superlien. See 229 Main St. Ltd. P'ship v. Mass. Dep't of Envt'l Prot., 251 B.R. 186, 193 (D. Mass. 2000). This appeal ensued. Because its resolution turns on questions of statutory interpretation, we exercise plenary review. See Soares v. Brockton Credit Union (In re Soares), 107 F.3d 969, 973 (1st Cir. 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. THE STATUTES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As this case perches at a crossroads formed by the intersection of federal and state law, we set out the pieces of the statutory puzzle before attempting to fit them together. We begin with familiar fare: the automatic stay provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The automatic stay, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(a), is one of the fundamental protections afforded to debtors by the bankruptcy laws. Midatlantic Nat'l Bank v. N.J. Dep't of Envt'l Prot., 474 U.S. 494, 503 (1986). It gives debtors breathing room by stopping collection efforts in their tracks and permitting their resumption only when the stay is lifted by the bankruptcy court or dissolved by operation of law. Soares, 107 F.3d at 975. To accomplish these objectives, the statute provides that the filing of a bankruptcy petition halts a wide variety of specified creditor activities. See 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(a). This appeal does not require us to call the roll. It suffices for present purposes to note that the stay applies, inter alia, to \"any act to create, perfect, or enforce any lien against property of the estate.\" Id. &#167; 362(a)(4).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the automatic stay is an important part of the bankruptcy protection framework, it is not an absolute. Congress has crafted certain exceptions to the automatic stay. See id. &#167; 362(b). One of them, pertinent here, makes the automatic stay inapplicable to \"any act to perfect, or to maintain or continue the perfection of, an interest in property to the extent that the [bankruptcy] trustee's rights and powers are subject to such perfection under section 546(b) of [the Bankruptcy Code].\" Id. &#167; 362(b)(3). The companion statute, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 546(b), limits the debtor's powers to avoid statutory liens<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> by providing that they \"are subject to any generally applicable law that permits perfection of an interest in property to be effective against an entity that acquires rights in such property before the date of perfection.\" Id. &#167; 546(b)(1)(A). Thus, sections 362(b)(3) and 546(b)(1)(A), read together, plot the boundaries of the exception to the automatic stay which is at issue here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To this point, we have been discussing relevant federal statutes. But this appeal also involves a state environmental superlien statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21E, &#167; 13 (formally known as the Massachusetts Oil and Hazardous Material Prevention Act). The state legislature designed this statute to assure the prompt and efficient cleanup of hazardous materials.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Acme Laundry Co. v. Sec'y of Envt'l Affairs, 575 N.E.2d 1086, 1089 (Mass. 1991). It provides in pertinent part that once the Commonwealth spends money assessing or cleaning up a polluted tract of land, it may place a priority lien on that property:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any liability to the commonwealth [for cleanup costs] shall constitute a debt to the commonwealth. Any such debt . . . shall constitute a lien on all property owned by persons liable under this chapter when a statement of claim naming such persons is recorded, registered or filed. . . . Any lien recorded, registered or filed pursuant to this section shall have priority over any encumbrance theretofore recorded, registered or filed with respect to any site . . . described in such statement of claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21E, &#167; 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question here is whether the environmental superlien fits within the exception described in sections 362(b)(3) and 546(b) of the Bankruptcy Code. The debtor argues that the superlien falls outside the narrow boundaries of the exception and thus succumbs to the automatic stay. The Commonwealth demurs, maintaining that its superlien comes within the safe harbor dredged by the exception and thus evades the automatic stay. In the pages that follow, we examine these dueling interpretations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE STATUTES IN ACTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eligibility for the pertinent exception to the automatic stay depends upon the existence vel non of three elements: there must be (1) an \"act to perfect\" (2) an \"interest in property\" (3) under circumstances in which the perfection-authorizing statute fits within the contours of section 546(b)(1)(A). We deal with the first two elements in Part III(A), reserving the third for discussion in Part III(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Section 362(b)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In parsing section 362(b)(3), we alter the natural progression: because the question of what constitutes an interest in property is crucial to the resolution of the questions that follow -- both section 362(b)(3) and section 546(b)(1)(A) contain an \"interest in property\" requirement -- we begin there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. \"Interest in property.\" The threshold question is whether the Commonwealth had a prepetition interest in the Property.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Although the parties are at loggerheads on a variety of issues, they are in perfect harmony on two important preliminary matters. First, the debtor acknowledges at this point in the proceedings that it was indebted to the Commonwealth under chapter 21E. This is as it should be, for Massachusetts law makes it pellucid that once the Commonwealth expends any funds in connection with the assessment or cleanup of a contaminated property, a debt is created. See Acme Laundry, 575 N.E.2d at 1090. Second, it is beyond cavil that at the time the debtor sought the protection of the bankruptcy court, the Commonwealth had not recorded a lien against the Property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These agreed facts bring us to the crucial question: Did the Commonwealth have an interest in the Property at the time the debtor filed its bankruptcy petition? On that issue, the harmony dissipates. The debtor contends that section 362(b)(3)'s \"interest in property\" requirement only can be satisfied by the existence, prepetition, of a lien; and that, since no such lien was of record when the bankruptcy court's jurisdiction attached, the Commonwealth had no interest in the Property (and, therefore, cannot qualify for the balm of section 362(b)(3)). The Commonwealth sings a different tune. It asserts that the term \"interest in property,\" as used in section 362(b)(3), is broader than the term \"lien\"; and that it had a prepetition interest in the Property arising out of a medley of factors, including its expenditures for cleanup, its right to record a superlien, its notice to the debtor that it intended to record such a lien, and its taking of all possible administrative steps toward recordation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the term \"interest in property\" is not synonymous with the term \"lien.\" In arriving at this conclusion, we look first to the plain language of section 362(b)(3). See Boivin v. Black, 225 F.3d 36, 40 (1st Cir. 2000) (explaining that all statutory analysis must begin with the language of the particular statute sub judice). The language of an unambiguous statute normally determines its meaning. Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U.S. 868, 873 (1991); State of R.I. v. Narragansett Indian Tribe, 19 F.3d 685, 698 (1st Cir. 1994). It follows inexorably that when a statute's plain language points in a single direction, an inquiring court ordinarily should look no further. United States v. Hilario, 218 F.3d 19, 23 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 121 S. Ct. 572 (2000). These principles apply here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress is familiar with the word \"lien,\" and used that word frequently in drafting the Bankruptcy Code. E.g., 11 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 361(a), 364, 544(a), 545. It is an orthodox tenet of statutory construction that \"where Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute, but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\" Duncan v. Walker, 121 S. Ct. 2120, 2125 (2001) (quoting Bates v. United States, 522 U.S. 23, 29-30 (1997)). Honoring this tenet, we ascribe considerable significance to the fact that section 362(b)(3) uses the term \"interest in property\" rather than the term \"lien.\" Giving Congress's word choices their full effect is an especially attractive option here. After all, the text of section 362(b)(3) is straightforward and leads to a perfectly plausible result. That makes the case for plain meaning extremely compelling. See Pritzker v. Yari, 42 F.3d 53, 67-68 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"As a fundamental principle of statutory construction, we will not depart from, or otherwise embellish, the language of a statute absent either undeniable textual ambiguity or some other extraordinary consideration, such as the prospect of yielding a patently absurd result.\"). We therefore conclude that the term \"interest in property\" as used in section 362(b)(3) is broader than the term \"lien.\" Accord Lincoln Sav. Bank v. Suffolk County Treasurer (In re Parr Meadows Racing Ass'n), 880 F.2d 1540, 1548 (2d Cir. 1989) (finding that state's interest in property dated from the assessment of real property taxes rather than from the recordation of a tax lien);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Maryland Nat'l Bank v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore (In re Maryland Glass Corp.), 723 F.2d 1138, 1142 (4th Cir. 1983) (concluding that state had an interest in real property, in the form of a right to require that sale proceeds be applied first to taxes due at the time of sale, notwithstanding absence of lien); Fitch v. Jones &amp; Lamson Mach. Co. (In re Jones &amp; Lamson Mach. Co.), 113 B.R. 124, 129 (Bankr. D. Conn. 1990) (finding that interest in property arose when employees performed services for the debtor rather than when lien was created).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to force-feed its narrow construction of the phrase \"interest in property,\" the debtor points out that the Bankruptcy Code defines a lien as an \"interest in property\" (specifically, as an \"interest in property to secure payment of a debt or performance of an obligation,\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 101(37)). But the mere fact that a lien is one kind of interest in property does not mean that a lien is the only kind of interest in property recognized by section 362(b)(3). Cf. Maryland Glass, 723 F.2d at 1141-42 (finding that the term \"interest in property,\" as used in 11 U.S.C. &#167; 546(b), is not limited to liens).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the debtor adverts to decisions that have equated an interest in property under section 362(b)(3) with a lien. E.g., Equibank, N.A. v. Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp., 884 F.2d 80, 85 (3d Cir. 1989) (equating \"interest in property\" with \"lien\" in context of real property taxes). Withal, \"[p]roperty interests are created and defined by state law,\" Butner v. United States, 440 U.S. 48, 55 (1979), and these cases often turn on differences in state law, e.g, CS First Boston Mortgage Capital Corp. v. RV Centennial P'ship (In re RV Centennial P'ship), 202 B.R. 774, 777 (Bankr. D. Colo. 1996) (distinguishing case from similar bankruptcy cases based upon differences in state property law). The fact that \"interest in property\" and \"lien\" may be synonymous under the law of a particular state or under a particular state statute does not render the terms coextensive for purposes of the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this phase of our inquiry. We hold that \"interest in property,\" as that term is used in 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(b)(3), is unequivalent to, and broader than, the term \"lien.\" With that definitional building block in place, we move to the question of whether, under Massachusetts law, the Commonwealth had an interest in the Property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties reasonably assume that, under the environmental superlien statute, a debt comes into being once the Commonwealth has incurred expenses relating to the cleanup of a particular piece of property; the debt ripens into a lien when recorded; and recording the lien simultaneously perfects it. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21E, &#167; 13. But these reference points have limited utility for purposes of our inquiry: after all, a section 13 debt is not an interest in property, see In re Microfab, Inc., 105 B.R. 152, 159 n.10 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1989), and, as discussed above, the term \"lien\" cannot be employed as a proxy for an \"interest in property.\" Thus, we search for guidance beyond the four corners of the environmental superlien statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Acme Laundry, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) dealt extensively with the superlien statute. While the court did not directly answer the question before us, its discussion is quite helpful. For example, the SJC limned the statute's central purpose: to assure that the costs of environmental cleanup are \"borne by those who are responsible for the release because they own or owned the land or because they caused the spill.\" 575 N.E.2d at 1089. The importance that the legislature attaches to this goal is illustrated by the severe sanctions imposed on those who violate cleanup orders. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21E, &#167; 11 (providing for civil penalties, fines, and imprisonment). The SJC also made clear that the liability created by the Commonwealth's expenditure of funds is wide-ranging, encompassing future costs and immediately triggering the right to record a lien. Acme Laundry, 575 N.E.2d at 1090.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the debtor was liable to the Commonwealth for past and future cleanup costs; the Commonwealth had a present right to record a lien on the Property; and it had set that process in motion by notifying the debtor of its intentions and participating vigorously in the administrative hearing process. Viewing these facts through the prism of Acme Laundry, we conclude, as did the district court, 229 Main St., 251 B.R. at 192, that this amalgam -- the Commonwealth's expenditures, together with its notice of intent to record a lien and its tenacious pursuit of that lien through administrative channels -- sufficed to satisfy section 362(b)(3)'s \"interest in property\" requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find support for this conclusion in the only reported case directly in point. In that case, In re Perona Bros., Inc., 186 B.R. 833 (D.N.J. 1995), the district court considered the question of a state's prepetition interest in property in the context of an environmental superlien and concluded that far less than what exists here was sufficient to establish such an interest. The court determined that New Jersey obtained an interest in the debtor's property on the date the state notified the debtor that it would place a superpriority lien on the property if it had to commence the cleanup of toxic waste. Id. at 839. Although the state's only prepetition act was this notice -- the totality of the state's cleanup efforts occurred postpetition, id. at 835 -- the court found that solitary act sufficient to establish an interest in the property. Id. If the facts of Perona Bros. yielded an interest in property, then a fortiori, the facts of the instant case can yield no less.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. \"Act to perfect.\" We next turn to the \"act to perfect\" requirement of section 362(b)(3). When the Commonwealth takes the step of recording under the environmental superlien statute, that act both creates and perfects its lien. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21E, &#167; 13. The debtor points out that while the automatic stay applies to \"any act to create, perfect, or enforce,\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(a)(4), section 362(b)(3) only exempts acts to perfect.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Based on this discrepancy, it concludes that an act which simultaneously creates and perfects cannot qualify for an exception to the automatic stay under section 362(b)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At first glance, there seems to be a deep division of authority on this point -- some bankruptcy courts permitting simultaneous postpetition creation and perfection of an interest in property pursuant to section 362(b)(3) and others prohibiting such a step. But this is not the issue that actually divides those courts. Instead, the courts split over the issue of what constitutes an interest in property, and that divergence drives the seeming disagreement over the status of \"creation plus perfection.\" In other words, courts that hew to the proposition that \"interest in property\" means \"lien\" do not allow simultaneous postpetition creation and perfection of liens, while contrary-minded courts tend to hold the opposite.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This dichotomy makes perfect sense. The availability of Section 362(b)(3) generally is thought to depend upon the existence of a prepetition interest in property. See 3 Collier on Bankruptcy &#182; 362.05[5] (Lawrence P. King ed., 15th ed. rev. 2001) (\"Section 362(b)(3) does not authorize the creation of new rights or interests for the creditor.\"). But cf. supra note 3. If the particular interest is a lien, that lien must be in place prepetition before section 362(b)(3) can come into play. An act that both creates and perfects a lien postpetition cannot so qualify. See, e.g., Louisville &amp; Jefferson County Metro. Sewer Dist. v. Excel Eng'g, Inc. (In re Excel Eng'g, Inc.), 224 B.R. 582, 589-90 (Bankr. W.D. Ky. 1998) (refusing to recognize validity of postpetition creation and perfection of mechanic's lien because creditor had no lien at the time debtor filed for bankruptcy); Watervliet Paper Co. v. City of Watervliet (In re Shoreham Paper Co.), 117 B.R. 274, 281-83 (Bankr. W.D. Mich. 1990) (finding postpetition creation and perfection of property tax lien barred by automatic stay because no prepetition interest existed); Equitable Life Assur. Soc'y v. Ballentine Bros. (In re Ballentine Bros.), 86 B.R. 198, 201 (Bankr. D. Neb. 1988) (holding that creation of a postpetition tax levy based on a prepetition assessment was barred by the automatic stay); North Side Lumber Co. v. Indus. Indem. Co. (In re North Side Lumber Co.), 59 B.R. 917, 921-23 (Bankr. D. Or. 1986) (barring filing of statutory lien that simultaneously created and perfected an interest in property because lien did not exist at the time of the bankruptcy filing).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts which recognize that there is no necessary congruence between an interest in property and a lien end up in a different place. Such courts routinely read the section 362(b)(3) exception to leave room for the simultaneous postpetition creation and perfection of liens based on prepetition interests in property. See, e.g., In re Summit Ventures, Inc., 135 B.R. 483, 492 (Bankr. D. Vt. 1991) (allowing postpetition creation and perfection of tax lien based on prepetition interest in form of tax assessment); Jones &amp; Lamson Mach., 113 B.R. at 129 (permitting postpetition creation and perfection of mechanic's lien where plaintiffs' work for debtor constituted their prepetition interest in property); see also Parr Meadows, 880 F.2d at 1548 (upholding, without discussion, the simultaneous postpetition creation and perfection of a tax lien for section 362(b)(3) purposes where the county's preexisting tax assessment constituted a prepetition interest in the property).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, the plain language of section 362(b)(3) suggests the answer to the question of whether the environmental superlien statute's simultaneous creation-plus-perfection model fits under the statutory umbrella. The statute provides in pertinent part that the automatic stay does not apply to \"any act to perfect . . . an interest in property. . . .\" Bearing in mind that \"interest in property\" is broader than \"lien,\" see supra Part III(A)(1), this language appears to cover the simultaneous creation and perfection of a lien based on a prepetition interest in property. An act that both creates and perfects in one fell swoop is an act to perfect. Since section 362(b)(3) says that the filing of a bankruptcy petition does not automatically stay an act to perfect, the simultaneous postpetition creation and perfection of a lien may come within the pertinent exception to the automatic stay so long as the creditor holds a valid prepetition interest in the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We buttress this conclusion with two practical observations. First, applying the debtor's interpretation -- that section 362(b)(3)'s use of the unembellished word \"perfect\" means that an act of combined creation and perfection remains subject to the automatic stay -- would lead to an absurd result. Under the debtor's theory, an act that effected the concurrent creation and perfection of a lien would, at one and the same time, be both stayed (by section 362(a)(4)) and exempted from the stay (by section 362(a)(3)). We decline to indulge in so schizophrenic a reading of the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, statutory liens often are created and perfected by the same act. Congress clearly intended section 546(b)'s limitation on the debtor's avoidance power to extend to statutory liens; after all, section 546(b) specifically refers to section 545, which deals with the avoidance of statutory liens. Since Congress incorporated section 546(b) into the section 362(b)(3) exception, it is logical to infer that Congress intended that statutory liens would, at times, be exempt from the automatic stay. Under the debtor's interpretation, a significant class of statutory liens -- those that are created and perfected by the same act -- would never be exempt from the automatic stay. It seems difficult to reconcile this outcome with Congress's discernible intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we conclude that the act of simultaneous creation and perfection effectuated by the Massachusetts environmental superlien statute qualifies as an \"act to perfect\" under section 362(b)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Section 546(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bankruptcy Code delineates the scope of a debtor's power to avoid certain creditor initiatives. But this power is circumscribed in certain respects. Insofar as it applies to statutory liens, this power cannot be exercised to curtail \"any generally applicable law that permits perfection of an interest in property to be effective against an entity that acquires rights in such property before the date of perfection.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 546(b)(1)(A). The purpose of section 546(b) is to \"protect, in spite of the surprise intervention of a bankruptcy petition, those whom state law protects by allowing them to perfect their liens or interests as of an effective date that is earlier than the date of perfection.\" H.R. Rep. No. 95-595, at 371-72 (1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6327. For a particular creditor to reach the haven contemplated by section 546(b)(1)(A), three elements must coalesce: (1) the creditor must act pursuant to a law of general applicability; (2) that law must allow the creditor to perfect an interest in property; and (3) such perfection must be effective against previously acquired rights in the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first of these elements requires little discussion. For a law to be \"generally applicable,\" it must apply to cases within and without the bankruptcy sphere. See Makoroff v. City of Lockport, 916 F.2d 890, 892 (3d Cir. 1990). The debtor concedes that the environmental superlien statute here at issue, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21E, &#167; 13, satisfies this definition. The remaining two elements require more detailed elaboration. We consolidate our discussion of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The debtor asserts that the superlien statute does not permit \"perfection of an interest in property to be effective against an entity that acquires rights in such property before the date of perfection.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 546(b)(1)(A). To support this assertion, it makes three claims: that the Commonwealth held no prepetition interest in the Property; that perfection (here, the act of recording) is a prerequisite to establishing priority, but no act of recordation ever occurred; and that only state statutes that contain specific \"relation back\" language can come within the parameters of section 546(b). We address these claims sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accepting for argument's sake the debtor's view that section 546(b) requires a interest in property which arises prepetition, we nonetheless find the debtor's ipse dixit that the Commonwealth had no prepetition interest in the Property foreclosed by our earlier determination that the Commonwealth in fact enjoyed such a prepetition interest. See supra Part III(A)(1). The debtor nimbly skips to another point -- the lack of a section 13 lien on the Property. To be sure, there is no such lien -- but that fact does not support the conclusion that the debtor draws from it. The only reason that the Commonwealth has not recorded a lien is that its efforts to convert its interest in the Property into a full-blown lien have been stalled by the debtor's demand for an adjudicative hearing. This circumstance does not preclude us from resolving the issue of whether the environmental superlien statute measures up to the specific requirements imposed by section 546(b)(1)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Last, the debtor suggests, citing a snippet plucked from section 546(b)'s legislative history, that a state statute must explicitly provide that perfection relate back to a prepetition date in order to fit within the safe harbor contemplated by section 546(b)(1)(A). There are three reasons why we find this suggestion unconvincing. The short response to it is that section 546(b)(1)(A) enunciates no such requirement, and courts cannot limit legislation by cavalierly conjuring up qualifications that the legislature has either eschewed or neglected to consider. See Brogan v. United States, 522 U.S. 398, 408 (1998); United States v. Sebaggala 256 F.3d 59, 64-65 (1st Cir. 2001) Nor can legislative history save this sinking ship. While legislative history sometimes can be a useful aid to statutory construction, recourse to it is impermissible to vary the words of an unambiguous statute where those words, straightforwardly applied, yield an entirely plausible result. Narragansett Indian Tribe, 19 F.3d at 698; United States v. Charles George Trucking Co., 823 F.2d 685, 688 (1st Cir. 1987). That is the case here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sockdolager is that the excerpt from the legislative history which the debtor hawks, read in context, does not contradict the statutory text. That excerpt states that \"the rights granted under this subsection prevail over the trustee only if the transferee has perfected the transfer in accordance with applicable law and the perfection relates back to a date that is before the commencement of the case.\" H.R. Rep. No. 95-595, supra, at 371. Contrary to the debtor's importunings, this sentence does not impose a specific relation-back requirement; it merely reiterates that, to qualify for the safe harbor, the perfection must have a retroactive effect in the sense that once an interest is perfected it will take priority over earlier perfected interests. See Klein v. Civale &amp; Trovato, Inc. (In re Lionel Corp.), 29 F.3d 88, 93 (2d Cir. 1994) (\"As long as an 'applicable law' authorizes perfection after another party has acquired interests in the property, a lienor fits within the exception.\"); In re Albert, 206 B.R. 636, 640 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1997) (explaining that, once perfected, a lien that takes priority over earlier liens satisfies the requirements of section 546(b)(1)(A)); In re 1301 Conn. Ave. Assocs., 117 B.R. 2, 11 (Bankr. D.D.C. 1990) (noting that section 546(b) applies to any lien that takes precedence over an earlier perfected interest in the property).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The debtor has one more shot in its sling. It invites us to accord decretory significance to the fact that the legislative history mentions a section of the Uniform Commercial Code which contains an explicit \"relation back\" provision, U.C.C. &#167; 9-301(2),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> as an example of a statute that would find sanctuary in the safe harbor created by section 546(b)(1)(A). See H.R. Rep. No. 95-595, supra, at 371. Using this as a springboard, the debtor leaps to the conclusion that section 546(b)(1)(A) implicitly requires that a qualifying state statute contain an explicit \"relation back\" provision. This is simply too much of a stretch: while U.C.C. &#167; 9-301(2) is one example of a state statute that fits under the wide umbrella of section 546(b)(1)(A), other types of statutes can find shelter there as well. The key is not relation back, but, rather, whether the statute in question provides for an interest that, once perfected, trumps earlier-filed claims. See Lionel Corp., 29 F.3d at 93; Albert, 206 B.R. at 640; 1301 Conn. Ave. Assocs., 117 B.R. at 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The three cases that the debtor cites in support of its argument that section 546(b)(1)(A) requires an explicit relation-back provision -- Makoroff, 916 F.2d 890, Shoreham Paper, 117 B.R. 274, and In re Prichard Plaza Assocs. Ltd. P'ship, 84 B.R. 289 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1988) -- are unhelpful. We review them briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Makoroff involved a situation in which local taxing authorities claimed, pursuant to section 546(b)(1)(A), that they had a right to a priority lien on the debtor's property to secure unpaid property taxes accruing after bankruptcy proceedings had been instituted. 916 F.2d at 891. The court found section 546(b)(1)(A) inapplicable because the debt did not relate back to any prepetition interest in the taxed property. Id. at 893-96. The case stands for the proposition that section 546(b)(1)(A) requires a prepetition interest, not for the proposition that a statute must contain an explicit relation-back provision to qualify under section 546(b)(1)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shoreham Paper is similarly inapposite. There, the bankruptcy court held that a tax lien created and perfected postpetition did not come within the ambit of 546(b)(1)(A) because the lien did not relate back to a prepetition date. 117 B.R. at 281. The case states no rule requiring that a statute have an explicit relation-back requirement, and moreover, it is distinguishable on the ground that the actual amount of the tax was determined, and the tax bill issued, after the taxpayer had filed for bankruptcy. See id. at 275-76. This, the court found, did not give rise to a prepetition interest. Id. at 281.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We regard Prichard Plaza as an outlier. There, the bankruptcy court coined an oddly suggestive phrase in construing section 546(b) as applying only to statutes that accorded \"retroactive priority effect.\" 84 B.R. at 301. But it is not clear whether the court was advocating a strict requirement that qualifying state statutes must contain specific \"relation back\" language; and, at any rate, a later case from the same court repudiates such a requirement. See Microfab, 105 B.R. at 158; see also 1301 Conn. Ave. Assocs., 117 B.R. at 10-11 (rejecting the idea that section 546(b) contains a strict retroactivity requirement); cf. In re 1350 Piccard Ltd.

In Lionel Corp., 29 F.3d at 93, the Second Circuit discerned \"nothing in &#167; 546(b) indicating that it applies only when the lienor fits within a 'relation-back' statute.\" We share this view and, accordingly, we hold that there is no requirement that the \"generally applicable law\" referenced in section 546(b) contain an explicit relation-back mechanism.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now circle back to the original inquiry: whether the Massachusetts environmental superlien statute meets the second and third of section 546(b)(1)(A)'s stated criteria, that is, whether it \"permits perfection of an interest in property to be effective against an entity that acquires rights in such property before the date of perfection.\" The gist of section 546(b)(1)(A) is that \"the filing of a bankruptcy petition does not prevent the holder of an interest in property from perfecting its interest if, absent the bankruptcy filing, the interest holder could have perfected its interest against an entity acquiring rights in the property before the date of perfection.\" 5 Collier on Bankruptcy, supra, &#182; 546.03[2][a]. In this instance, the environmental superlien statute permits the perfection of an interest in property by recording, registering, or filing that interest. See Microfab, 105 B.R. at 156. Such perfection plainly is effective against entities which already had acquired rights in the property. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21E, &#167; 13 (\"Any lien recorded, registered or filed pursuant to this section shall have priority over any encumbrance theretofore recorded, registered or filed with respect to any site . . . described in such statement of claim.\"); see also Microfab, 105 B.R. at 156 (explaining that the Commonwealth's lien trumps all other encumbrances, no matter when filed). These credentials satisfy section 546(b)(1)(A)'s third criterion, see Lionel Corp., 29 F.3d at 93, and, therefore, the environmental superlien statute meets all the eligibility requirements for inclusion within section 546(b)(1)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V.

The pivotal question, heretofore untouched by any appellate court, is whether the automatic stay provision of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(a), prevents a state from simultaneously creating and perfecting an environmental superlien on a debtor's property after the institution of a bankruptcy proceeding. Both the bankruptcy court and the district court answered this surpassingly close question in the negative, holding that the environmental superlien evades the grasp of the automatic stay. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The debtor, 229 Main Street Limited Partnership, owns a shopping plaza on Main Street in Natick, Massachusetts (the Property). For many years, a dry cleaning business leased space in the plaza. As a result, the Property became profoundly contaminated with chemicals and other pollutants. In time, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (the Commonwealth) concluded that contamination from the Property posed a dire threat to drinking water in the town of Natick. To avert this threat, the Commonwealth spent large sums of money on emergency cleanup activities. It then sought reimbursement for these expenses, along with assurances in respect to anticipated future expenditures, from the debtor. Moreover, the Commonwealth informed the debtor, by letter dated November 5, 1998, that it intended to record a lien against the Property to secure present and future cleanup costs. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21E, &#167; 13 (the environmental superlien statute).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Initially, the debtor denied responsibility for the contamination and contested the dollar amount that the Commonwealth placed on cleanup costs. Accordingly, it demanded an adjudicatory hearing. See 310 C.M.R. &#167; 40.1254. The hearing moved slowly. Before it concluded, the debtor filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1101-1174. By the debtor's own admission, a principal reason behind this filing was a desire to avoid perfection of the Commonwealth's lien. To that extent, the maneuver failed; the hearing officer ruled that the environmental superlien statute fell within an exception to the automatic stay and refused to adjourn the administrative proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The debtor countered by asking the bankruptcy court to hold the Commonwealth in contempt for continuing to press forward in the postpetition period. The bankruptcy court refused the debtor's request. When the debtor appealed, the district court followed suit, ruling that the automatic stay did not preclude continuation of the proceedings necessary to perfect the Commonwealth's environmental superlien. See 229 Main St. Ltd. P'ship v. Mass. Dep't of Envt'l Prot., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1534567\"><a href=\"/opinion/1534567/229-main-street-limited-partnership-v-commonwealth/\"><span class=\"volume\">251</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">186</span></a></span>, 193 (D. Mass. 2000). This appeal ensued. Because its resolution turns on questions of statutory interpretation, we exercise plenary review. See Soares v. Brockton Credit Union (In re Soares), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197245\"><a href=\"/opinion/197245/soares-v-brockton-credit/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">969</span></a></span>, 973 (1st Cir. 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. THE STATUTES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As this case perches at a crossroads formed by the intersection of federal and state law, we set out the pieces of the statutory puzzle before attempting to fit them together. We begin with familiar fare: the automatic stay provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The automatic stay, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(a), is one of the fundamental protections afforded to debtors by the bankruptcy laws. Midatlantic Nat'l Bank v. N.J. Dep't of Envt'l Prot., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111562\"><a href=\"/opinion/111562/midlantic-nat-bank-v-new-jersey-dept-of-environmental-protection/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">494</span></a></span>, 503 (1986). It gives debtors breathing room by stopping collection efforts in their tracks and permitting their resumption only when the stay is lifted by the bankruptcy court or dissolved by operation of law. Soares, 107 F.3d at 975. To accomplish these objectives, the statute provides that the filing of a bankruptcy petition halts a wide variety of specified creditor activities. See 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(a). This appeal does not require us to call the roll. It suffices for present purposes to note that the stay applies, inter alia, to \"any act to create, perfect, or enforce any lien against property of the estate.\" Id. &#167; 362(a)(4).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the automatic stay is an important part of the bankruptcy protection framework, it is not an absolute. Congress has crafted certain exceptions to the automatic stay. See id. &#167; 362(b). One of them, pertinent here, makes the automatic stay inapplicable to \"any act to perfect, or to maintain or continue the perfection of, an interest in property to the extent that the [bankruptcy] trustee's rights and powers are subject to such perfection under section 546(b) of [the Bankruptcy Code].\" Id. &#167; 362(b)(3). The companion statute, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 546(b), limits the debtor's powers to avoid statutory liens<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> by providing that they \"are subject to any generally applicable law that permits perfection of an interest in property to be effective against an entity that acquires rights in such property before the date of perfection.\" Id. &#167; 546(b)(1)(A). Thus, sections 362(b)(3) and 546(b)(1)(A), read together, plot the boundaries of the exception to the automatic stay which is at issue here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To this point, we have been discussing relevant federal statutes. But this appeal also involves a state environmental superlien statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21E, &#167; 13 (formally known as the Massachusetts Oil and Hazardous Material Prevention Act). The state legislature designed this statute to assure the prompt and efficient cleanup of hazardous materials.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Acme Laundry Co. v. Sec'y of Envt'l Affairs, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">575</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1086</span></span>, 1089 (Mass. 1991). It provides in pertinent part that once the Commonwealth spends money assessing or cleaning up a polluted tract of land, it may place a priority lien on that property:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any liability to the commonwealth [for cleanup costs] shall constitute a debt to the commonwealth. Any such debt . . . shall constitute a lien on all property owned by persons liable under this chapter when a statement of claim naming such persons is recorded, registered or filed. . . .

The debtor argues that the superlien falls outside the narrow boundaries of the exception and thus succumbs to the automatic stay. The Commonwealth demurs, maintaining that its superlien comes within the safe harbor dredged by the exception and thus evades the automatic stay. In the pages that follow, we examine these dueling interpretations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE STATUTES IN ACTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eligibility for the pertinent exception to the automatic stay depends upon the existence vel non of three elements: there must be (1) an \"act to perfect\" (2) an \"interest in property\" (3) under circumstances in which the perfection-authorizing statute fits within the contours of section 546(b)(1)(A). We deal with the first two elements in Part III(A), reserving the third for discussion in Part III(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Section 362(b)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In parsing section 362(b)(3), we alter the natural progression: because the question of what constitutes an interest in property is crucial to the resolution of the questions that follow -- both section 362(b)(3) and section 546(b)(1)(A) contain an \"interest in property\" requirement -- we begin there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. \"Interest in property.\" The threshold question is whether the Commonwealth had a prepetition interest in the Property.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Although the parties are at loggerheads on a variety of issues, they are in perfect harmony on two important preliminary matters. First, the debtor acknowledges at this point in the proceedings that it was indebted to the Commonwealth under chapter 21E. This is as it should be, for Massachusetts law makes it pellucid that once the Commonwealth expends any funds in connection with the assessment or cleanup of a contaminated property, a debt is created. See Acme Laundry, 575 N.E.2d at 1090. Second, it is beyond cavil that at the time the debtor sought the protection of the bankruptcy court, the Commonwealth had not recorded a lien against the Property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These agreed facts bring us to the crucial question: Did the Commonwealth have an interest in the Property at the time the debtor filed its bankruptcy petition? On that issue, the harmony dissipates. The debtor contends that section 362(b)(3)'s \"interest in property\" requirement only can be satisfied by the existence, prepetition, of a lien; and that, since no such lien was of record when the bankruptcy court's jurisdiction attached, the Commonwealth had no interest in the Property (and, therefore, cannot qualify for the balm of section 362(b)(3)). The Commonwealth sings a different tune. It asserts that the term \"interest in property,\" as used in section 362(b)(3), is broader than the term \"lien\"; and that it had a prepetition interest in the Property arising out of a medley of factors, including its expenditures for cleanup, its right to record a superlien, its notice to the debtor that it intended to record such a lien, and its taking of all possible administrative steps toward recordation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the term \"interest in property\" is not synonymous with the term \"lien.\" In arriving at this conclusion, we look first to the plain language of section 362(b)(3). See Boivin v. Black, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199075\"><a href=\"/opinion/199075/boivin-v-black/\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 40 (1st Cir. 2000) (explaining that all statutory analysis must begin with the language of the particular statute sub judice). The language of an unambiguous statute normally determines its meaning. Freytag v.

It follows inexorably that when a statute's plain language points in a single direction, an inquiring court ordinarily should look no further. United States v. Hilario, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198998\"><a href=\"/opinion/198998/united-states-v-hilario/\"><span class=\"volume\">218</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">572</span></span> (2000). These principles apply here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress is familiar with the word \"lien,\" and used that word frequently in drafting the Bankruptcy Code. E.g., 11 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 361(a), 364, 544(a), 545. It is an orthodox tenet of statutory construction that \"where Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute, but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\" Duncan v. Walker, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1269282\"><a href=\"/opinion/1269282/duncan-v-walker/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Honoring this tenet, we ascribe considerable significance to the fact that section 362(b)(3) uses the term \"interest in property\" rather than the term \"lien.\" Giving Congress's word choices their full effect is an especially attractive option here. After all, the text of section 362(b)(3) is straightforward and leads to a perfectly plausible result. That makes the case for plain meaning extremely compelling. See Pritzker v. Yari, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"684076\"><a href=\"/opinion/684076/jay-a-pritzker-v-bob-yari/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span>, 67-68 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"As a fundamental principle of statutory construction, we will not depart from, or otherwise embellish, the language of a statute absent either undeniable textual ambiguity or some other extraordinary consideration, such as the prospect of yielding a patently absurd result.\"). We therefore conclude that the term \"interest in property\" as used in section 362(b)(3) is broader than the term \"lien.\" Accord Lincoln Sav. Bank v.

But the mere fact that a lien is one kind of interest in property does not mean that a lien is the only kind of interest in property recognized by section 362(b)(3). Cf. Maryland Glass, 723 F.2d at 1141-42 (finding that the term \"interest in property,\" as used in 11 U.S.C. &#167; 546(b), is not limited to liens).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the debtor adverts to decisions that have equated an interest in property under section 362(b)(3) with a lien. E.g., Equibank, N.A. v. Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"528454\"><a href=\"/opinion/528454/equibank-na-and-the-farmers-home-administration-v-wheeling-pittsburgh/\"><span class=\"volume\">884</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span>, 85 (3d Cir. 1989) (equating \"interest in property\" with \"lien\" in context of real property taxes).

D. Colo. 1996) (distinguishing case from similar bankruptcy cases based upon differences in state property law). The fact that \"interest in property\" and \"lien\" may be synonymous under the law of a particular state or under a particular state statute does not render the terms coextensive for purposes of the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this phase of our inquiry. We hold that \"interest in property,\" as that term is used in 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(b)(3), is unequivalent to, and broader than, the term \"lien.\" With that definitional building block in place, we move to the question of whether, under Massachusetts law, the Commonwealth had an interest in the Property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties reasonably assume that, under the environmental superlien statute, a debt comes into being once the Commonwealth has incurred expenses relating to the cleanup of a particular piece of property; the debt ripens into a lien when recorded; and recording the lien simultaneously perfects it. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21E, &#167; 13. But these reference points have limited utility for purposes of our inquiry: after all, a section 13 debt is not an interest in property, see In re Microfab, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2008358\"><a href=\"/opinion/2008358/in-re-microfab-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">152</span></a></span>, 159 n.10 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1989), and, as discussed above, the term \"lien\" cannot be employed as a proxy for an \"interest in property.\" Thus, we search for guidance beyond the four corners of the environmental superlien statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Acme Laundry, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) dealt extensively with the superlien statute. While the court did not directly answer the question before us, its discussion is quite helpful. For example, the SJC limned the statute's central purpose: to assure that the costs of environmental cleanup are \"borne by those who are responsible for the release because they own or owned the land or because they caused the spill.\" 575 N.E.2d at 1089. The importance that the legislature attaches to this goal is illustrated by the severe sanctions imposed on those who violate cleanup orders. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21E, &#167; 11 (providing for civil penalties, fines, and imprisonment). The SJC also made clear that the liability created by the Commonwealth's expenditure of funds is wide-ranging, encompassing future costs and immediately triggering the right to record a lien. Acme Laundry, 575 N.E.2d at 1090.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the debtor was liable to the Commonwealth for past and future cleanup costs; the Commonwealth had a present right to record a lien on the Property; and it had set that process in motion by notifying the debtor of its intentions and participating vigorously in the administrative hearing process. Viewing these facts through the prism of Acme Laundry, we conclude, as did the district court, 229 Main St., 251 B.R. at 192, that this amalgam -- the Commonwealth's expenditures, together with its notice of intent to record a lien and its tenacious pursuit of that lien through administrative channels -- sufficed to satisfy section 362(b)(3)'s \"interest in property\" requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find support for this conclusion in the only reported case directly in point. In that case, In re Perona Bros., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1551984\"><a href=\"/opinion/1551984/matter-of-perona-bros-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">186</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">833</span></a></span> (D.N.J. 1995), the district court considered the question of a state's prepetition interest in property in the context of an environmental superlien and concluded that far less than what exists here was sufficient to establish such an interest. The court determined that New Jersey obtained an interest in the debtor's property on the date the state notified the debtor that it would place a superpriority lien on the property if it had to commence the cleanup of toxic waste. Id. at 839. Although the state's only prepetition act was this notice -- the totality of the state's cleanup efforts occurred postpetition, id. at 835 -- the court found that solitary act sufficient to establish an interest in the property. Id. If the facts of Perona Bros. yielded an interest in property, then a fortiori, the facts of the instant case can yield no less.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. \"Act to perfect.\" We next turn to the \"act to perfect\" requirement of section 362(b)(3). When the Commonwealth takes the step of recording under the environmental superlien statute, that act both creates and perfects its lien. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21E, &#167; 13. The debtor points out that while the automatic stay applies to \"any act to create, perfect, or enforce,\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(a)(4), section 362(b)(3) only exempts acts to perfect.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Based on this discrepancy, it concludes that an act which simultaneously creates and perfects cannot qualify for an exception to the automatic stay under section 362(b)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At first glance, there seems to be a deep division of authority on this point -- some bankruptcy courts permitting simultaneous postpetition creation and perfection of an interest in property pursuant to section 362(b)(3) and others prohibiting such a step. But this is not the issue that actually divides those courts. Instead, the courts split over the issue of what constitutes an interest in property, and that divergence drives the seeming disagreement over the status of \"creation plus perfection.\" In other words, courts that hew to the proposition that \"interest in property\" means \"lien\" do not allow simultaneous postpetition creation and perfection of liens, while contrary-minded courts tend to hold the opposite.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This dichotomy makes perfect sense. The availability of Section 362(b)(3) generally is thought to depend upon the existence of a prepetition interest in property. See 3 Collier on Bankruptcy &#182; 362.05[5] (Lawrence P. King ed., 15th ed. rev. 2001) (\"Section 362(b)(3) does not authorize the creation of new rights or interests for the creditor.\"). But cf. supra note 3. If the particular interest is a lien, that lien must be in place prepetition before section 362(b)(3) can come into play. An act that both creates and perfects a lien postpetition cannot so qualify.

Such courts routinely read the section 362(b)(3) exception to leave room for the simultaneous postpetition creation and perfection of liens based on prepetition interests in property. See, e.g., In re Summit Ventures, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1910112\"><a href=\"/opinion/1910112/in-re-summit-ventures-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span>, 492 (Bankr.

Vt. 1991) (allowing postpetition creation and perfection of tax lien based on prepetition interest in form of tax assessment); Jones &amp; Lamson Mach., 113 B.R. at 129 (permitting postpetition creation and perfection of mechanic's lien where plaintiffs' work for debtor constituted their prepetition interest in property); see also Parr Meadows, 880 F.2d at 1548 (upholding, without discussion, the simultaneous postpetition creation and perfection of a tax lien for section 362(b)(3) purposes where the county's preexisting tax assessment constituted a prepetition interest in the property).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, the plain language of section 362(b)(3) suggests the answer to the question of whether the environmental superlien statute's simultaneous creation-plus-perfection model fits under the statutory umbrella. The statute provides in pertinent part that the automatic stay does not apply to \"any act to perfect . . . an interest in property. . . .\" Bearing in mind that \"interest in property\" is broader than \"lien,\" see supra Part III(A)(1), this language appears to cover the simultaneous creation and perfection of a lien based on a prepetition interest in property. An act that both creates and perfects in one fell swoop is an act to perfect. Since section 362(b)(3) says that the filing of a bankruptcy petition does not automatically stay an act to perfect, the simultaneous postpetition creation and perfection of a lien may come within the pertinent exception to the automatic stay so long as the creditor holds a valid prepetition interest in the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We buttress this conclusion with two practical observations. First, applying the debtor's interpretation -- that section 362(b)(3)'s use of the unembellished word \"perfect\" means that an act of combined creation and perfection remains subject to the automatic stay -- would lead to an absurd result. Under the debtor's theory, an act that effected the concurrent creation and perfection of a lien would, at one and the same time, be both stayed (by section 362(a)(4)) and exempted from the stay (by section 362(a)(3)). We decline to indulge in so schizophrenic a reading of the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, statutory liens often are created and perfected by the same act. Congress clearly intended section 546(b)'s limitation on the debtor's avoidance power to extend to statutory liens; after all, section 546(b) specifically refers to section 545, which deals with the avoidance of statutory liens. Since Congress incorporated section 546(b) into the section 362(b)(3) exception, it is logical to infer that Congress intended that statutory liens would, at times, be exempt from the automatic stay. Under the debtor's interpretation, a significant class of statutory liens -- those that are created and perfected by the same act -- would never be exempt from the automatic stay. It seems difficult to reconcile this outcome with Congress's discernible intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we conclude that the act of simultaneous creation and perfection effectuated by the Massachusetts environmental superlien statute qualifies as an \"act to perfect\" under section 362(b)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Section 546(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bankruptcy Code delineates the scope of a debtor's power to avoid certain creditor initiatives. But this power is circumscribed in certain respects. Insofar as it applies to statutory liens, this power cannot be exercised to curtail \"any generally applicable law that permits perfection of an interest in property to be effective against an entity that acquires rights in such property before the date of perfection.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 546(b)(1)(A). The purpose of section 546(b) is to \"protect, in spite of the surprise intervention of a bankruptcy petition, those whom state law protects by allowing them to perfect their liens or interests as of an effective date that is earlier than the date of perfection.\" H.R. Rep. No. 95-595, at 371-72 (1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6327. For a particular creditor to reach the haven contemplated by section 546(b)(1)(A), three elements must coalesce: (1) the creditor must act pursuant to a law of general applicability; (2) that law must allow the creditor to perfect an interest in property; and (3) such perfection must be effective against previously acquired rights in the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first of these elements requires little discussion. For a law to be \"generally applicable,\" it must apply to cases within and without the bankruptcy sphere. See Makoroff v. City of Lockport, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550098\"><a href=\"/opinion/550098/stanley-g-makoroff-trustee-for-guterl-special-steel-corporation-v-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">916</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">890</span></a></span>, 892 (3d Cir. 1990). The debtor concedes that the environmental superlien statute here at issue, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21E, &#167; 13, satisfies this definition. The remaining two elements require more detailed elaboration. We consolidate our discussion of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The debtor asserts that the superlien statute does not permit \"perfection of an interest in property to be effective against an entity that acquires rights in such property before the date of perfection.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 546(b)(1)(A). To support this assertion, it makes three claims: that the Commonwealth held no prepetition interest in the Property; that perfection (here, the act of recording) is a prerequisite to establishing priority, but no act of recordation ever occurred; and that only state statutes that contain specific \"relation back\" language can come within the parameters of section 546(b). We address these claims sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accepting for argument's sake the debtor's view that section 546(b) requires a interest in property which arises prepetition, we nonetheless find the debtor's ipse dixit that the Commonwealth had no prepetition interest in the Property foreclosed by our earlier determination that the Commonwealth in fact enjoyed such a prepetition interest. See supra Part III(A)(1). The debtor nimbly skips to another point -- the lack of a section 13 lien on the Property. To be sure, there is no such lien -- but that fact does not support the conclusion that the debtor draws from it. The only reason that the Commonwealth has not recorded a lien is that its efforts to convert its interest in the Property into a full-blown lien have been stalled by the debtor's demand for an adjudicative hearing. This circumstance does not preclude us from resolving the issue of whether the environmental superlien statute measures up to the specific requirements imposed by section 546(b)(1)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Last, the debtor suggests, citing a snippet plucked from section 546(b)'s legislative history, that a state statute must explicitly provide that perfection relate back to a prepetition date in order to fit within the safe harbor contemplated by section 546(b)(1)(A). There are three reasons why we find this suggestion unconvincing. The short response to it is that section 546(b)(1)(A) enunciates no such requirement, and courts cannot limit legislation by cavalierly conjuring up qualifications that the legislature has either eschewed or neglected to consider. See Brogan v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118168\"><a href=\"/opinion/118168/brogan-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span>, 408 (1998); United States v.

While legislative history sometimes can be a useful aid to statutory construction, recourse to it is impermissible to vary the words of an unambiguous statute where those words, straightforwardly applied, yield an entirely plausible result. Narragansett Indian Tribe, 19 F.3d at 698; United States v. Charles George Trucking Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"491460\"><a href=\"/opinion/491460/united-states-v-charles-george-trucking-co-charles-george-sr-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">823</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">685</span></a></span>, 688 (1st Cir. 1987). That is the case here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sockdolager is that the excerpt from the legislative history which the debtor hawks, read in context, does not contradict the statutory text. That excerpt states that \"the rights granted under this subsection prevail over the trustee only if the transferee has perfected the transfer in accordance with applicable law and the perfection relates back to a date that is before the commencement of the case.\" H.R. Rep. No. 95-595, supra, at 371. Contrary to the debtor's importunings, this sentence does not impose a specific relation-back requirement; it merely reiterates that, to qualify for the safe harbor, the perfection must have a retroactive effect in the sense that once an interest is perfected it will take priority over earlier perfected interests. See Klein v. Civale &amp; Trovato, Inc.

It invites us to accord decretory significance to the fact that the legislative history mentions a section of the Uniform Commercial Code which contains an explicit \"relation back\" provision, U.C.C. &#167; 9-301(2),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> as an example of a statute that would find sanctuary in the safe harbor created by section 546(b)(1)(A). See H.R. Rep. No. 95-595, supra, at 371. Using this as a springboard, the debtor leaps to the conclusion that section 546(b)(1)(A) implicitly requires that a qualifying state statute contain an explicit \"relation back\" provision. This is simply too much of a stretch: while U.C.C. &#167; 9-301(2) is one example of a state statute that fits under the wide umbrella of section 546(b)(1)(A), other types of statutes can find shelter there as well. The key is not relation back, but, rather, whether the statute in question provides for an interest that, once perfected, trumps earlier-filed claims.

There, the bankruptcy court held that a tax lien created and perfected postpetition did not come within the ambit of 546(b)(1)(A) because the lien did not relate back to a prepetition date. 117 B.R. at 281. The case states no rule requiring that a statute have an explicit relation-back requirement, and moreover, it is distinguishable on the ground that the actual amount of the tax was determined, and the tax bill issued, after the taxpayer had filed for bankruptcy. See id. at 275-76. This, the court found, did not give rise to a prepetition interest. Id. at 281.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We regard Prichard Plaza as an outlier. There, the bankruptcy court coined an oddly suggestive phrase in construing section 546(b) as applying only to statutes that accorded \"retroactive priority effect.\" 84 B.R. at 301. But it is not clear whether the court was advocating a strict requirement that qualifying state statutes must contain specific \"relation back\" language; and, at any rate, a later case from the same court repudiates such a requirement. See Microfab, 105 B.R. at 158; see also 1301 Conn. Ave. Assocs., 117 B.R. at 10-11 (rejecting the idea that section 546(b) contains a strict retroactivity requirement); cf. In re 1350 Piccard Ltd. P'ship, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1967740\"><a href=\"/opinion/1967740/in-re-1350-piccard-ltd-partnership/\"><span class=\"volume\">148</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 85 (Bankr. D.D.C. 1992) (concluding that any contrary suggestion in Prichard Plaza has been abrogated).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As opposed to these cases, we find more persuasive the view of the only other court of appeals to have addressed the precise question. In Lionel Corp., 29 F.3d at 93, the Second Circuit discerned \"nothing in &#167; 546(b) indicating that it applies only when the lienor fits within a 'relation-back' statute.\" We share this view and, accordingly, we hold that there is no requirement that the \"generally applicable law\" referenced in section 546(b) contain an explicit relation-back mechanism.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now circle back to the original inquiry: whether the Massachusetts environmental superlien statute meets the second and third of section 546(b)(1)(A)'s stated criteria, that is, whether it \"permits perfection of an interest in property to be effective against an entity that acquires rights in such property before the date of perfection.\" The gist of section 546(b)(1)(A) is that \"the filing of a bankruptcy petition does not prevent the holder of an interest in property from perfecting its interest if, absent the bankruptcy filing, the interest holder could have perfected its interest against an entity acquiring rights in the property before the date of perfection.\" 5 Collier on Bankruptcy, supra, &#182; 546.03[2][a]. In this instance, the environmental superlien statute permits the perfection of an interest in property by recording, registering, or filing that interest. See Microfab, 105 B.R. at 156. Such perfection plainly is effective against entities which already had acquired rights in the property. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 21E, &#167; 13 (\"Any lien recorded, registered or filed pursuant to this section shall have priority over any encumbrance theretofore recorded, registered or filed with respect to any site . . . described in such statement of claim.\"); see also Microfab, 105 B.R. at 156 (explaining that the Commonwealth's lien trumps all other encumbrances, no matter when filed). These credentials satisfy section 546(b)(1)(A)'s third criterion, see Lionel Corp., 29 F.3d at 93, and, therefore, the environmental superlien statute meets all the eligibility requirements for inclusion within section 546(b)(1)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. The statutory lien that the Commonwealth wishes to record meets the combined requirements of section 362(b)(3) and 546(b)(1)(A) and therefore falls within the exception to the automatic stay carved out by those provisions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Consequently, we uphold the decisions of the lower courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Many of these statutes refer to the trustee in bankruptcy, acting in the debtor's stead. For simplicity's sake, we refer throughout to debtors (although such references encompass trustees wherever applicable).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> At least two Justices of the United States Supreme Court have signaled support for such state initiatives. See Midatlantic Nat'l Bank, 474 U.S. at 517 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (\"States retain considerable latitude to ensure that priority status is allotted to their cleanup claims.\"); Ohio v. Kovacs, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111298\"><a href=\"/opinion/111298/ohio-v-kovacs/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span>, 286 (1985) (O'Connor, J., concurring) (suggesting that \"a State may protect its interest in the enforcement of its environmental laws by giving cleanup judgments the status of statutory liens or secured claims\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The Commonwealth advances the argument that an interest in property need not arise prior to the filing of a bankruptcy petition in order to qualify for consideration under section 362(b)(3). Because we find that the Commonwealth had a prepetition interest in the Property, see text infra, we need not reach the question of whether a postpetition interest, standing alone, could satisfy this element of the test.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> To be sure, the specific holding in Parr Meadows has been rendered moot by the enactment of 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(b)(18) (providing that the filing of a bankruptcy petition does not operate as a stay \"of the creation or perfection of a statutory lien for an ad valorem property tax . . . if such tax comes due after the filing of the petition\"). The reasoning of the Parr Meadows court nonetheless remains instructive, and we cite to the opinion on that basis.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> In terms, the statute also exempts acts to maintain and continue perfection. 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(b)(3). Those categories are irrelevant for present purposes (and, thus, we disregard them).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Under U.C.C. &#167; 9-301(2) the perfection of a purchase money security interest within a certain interval relates back to the date upon which the interest was acquired. See, e.g., In re Fiorillo &amp; Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1956541\"><a href=\"/opinion/1956541/matter-of-fiorillo-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 23 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 1982).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> In its appellate briefs, the debtor theorizes that placing environmental superliens outside the Bankruptcy Code's automatic stay provision frustrates congressional intent (and, therefore, offends the Supremacy Clause). Because this argument was not raised below, it is waived. See Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers Union, Local No. 59 v. Superline Transp. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"575211\"><a href=\"/opinion/575211/teamsters-chauffeurs-warehousemen-and-helpers-union-local-no-59-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"If any principle is settled in this circuit, it is that, absent the most extraordinary circumstances, legal theories not raised squarely in the lower court cannot be broached for the first time on appeal.\"). In any event, our conclusion that the superlien statute falls within an exception created by federal law precludes any persuasive argument that Congress intended otherwise.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
