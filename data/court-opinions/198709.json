Cedja, with whom Lawson Williams and Shapiro &amp;\r\nKreisman were on brief for Fleet Mortgage Group, Inc.\r\nCarl D. Aframe, Aframe &amp; Barnhill, for Kenneth A. Kaneb.\r\n\nNovember 8, 1999\r\n\n*Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.                    LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.  Fleet Mortgage, Inc. (\"Fleet\"),\r\nappeals from the order of the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel\r\nfor the First Circuit affirming an award of damages and\r\nattorneys' fees by the bankruptcy court to Kenneth A.\r\nKaneb pursuant to 11 U.S.C. 362(h).  We review directly\r\nthe bankruptcy court's findings of fact and conclusions\r\nof law.  See Brandt v. Repco Printers &amp; Lithographics,\r\nInc. (In re Healthco Intl'l, Inc.), 132 F.3d 104, 107\r\n(1st Cir. 1997).  The bankruptcy court found that Fleet\r\nwillfully violated the automatic stay provision of the\r\nBankruptcy Code and awarded Kaneb $25,000 for emotional\r\ndistress and $18,220.68 for attorneys' fees and costs on\r\nappeal.  Fleet contests the finding that the violation of\r\nthe automatic stay was willful and challenges the award\r\nof damages for emotional distress.  Fleet also seeks\r\nrelief from its pretrial stipulation relating to a\r\nviolation of the stay.  We affirm the decision of the\r\nBankruptcy Appellate Panel (\"BAP\").  \r\n                    I.  \r\nIn 1993, Kaneb filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under\r\nChapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code.  An eighty-five year old retiree\r\nand widower, Kaneb spent the cold-weather months in Florida and the\r\nbalance of the year in Massachusetts.  After the sale of his\r\nMassachusetts residence to pay secured creditors, he converted to\r\nChapter 7 bankruptcy.  Shawmut Bank, N.A. (\"Shawmut\"), was the\r\noriginal mortgagee of Kaneb's second residence, a Florida\r\ncondominium. \r\nShawmut sought relief from the automatic stay in order to\r\ninitiate foreclosure proceedings.  The bankruptcy court denied\r\nShawmut's petition.  Kaneb and Shawmut entered into settlement\r\nnegotiations without success.  After the failed negotiations,\r\nShawmut forwarded Kaneb's file to the Florida law firm of Shapiro\r\n&amp; Fishman (\"Fleet's counsel\") to initiate foreclosure proceedings. \r\nShawmut and Fleet merged on November 15, 1995.  \r\nThe file forwarded from Shawmut contained the order of\r\ndischarge, dated January 31, 1996, which relieved Kaneb from\r\npersonal liability for all debts dischargeable under 11 U.S.C.\r\n523.  The file also contained an unsigned order granting relief\r\nfrom the automatic stay.  The attorney from Shapiro &amp; Fishman\r\ntestified that she knew Kaneb was in bankruptcy but she thought\r\nthat the unsigned order for relief from the automatic stay meant\r\nthat the bankruptcy judge had granted relief.  Further, she\r\nerroneously believed that Fleet could initiate foreclosure\r\nproceedings lawfully because the bankruptcy court had issued an\r\norder of discharge.  On behalf of Fleet, Shapiro &amp; Fishman filed\r\na complaint for foreclosure in Florida state court on June 4, 1996.\r\nShortly after the initiation of the foreclosure, Kaneb's\r\nattorney informed Fleet's counsel of the automatic stay and faxed\r\ndocuments confirming this information.  Fleet's counsel placed\r\nKaneb's file on \"hold\" status.  Six weeks later, in response to a\r\nletter from Kaneb strenuously protesting the violation of the\r\nautomatic stay, Fleet's counsel dismissed the foreclosure suit.  \r\nDuring the six weeks that Fleet allowed the foreclosure suit\r\nto languish on \"hold\" status, Kaneb's neighbors learned of the\r\nforeclosure proceeding.  As a result of a foreclosure notice\r\npublished in a local Florida newspaper, Kaneb received a barrage of\r\ncolorful mail offering legal and investment services.  These\r\nsolicitations, known as \"dayglow mail,\" accumulated in Kaneb's\r\nFlorida mailbox.  Neighbors who regularly held his mail for him\r\nwhen he was in Massachusetts learned of the foreclosure action.  In\r\naddition, one of Kaneb's neighbors erroneously received a\r\nsolicitation addressed to Kaneb.\r\nOnce Kaneb's neighbors learned of the foreclosure suit, they\r\nbegan to avoid him.  The condominium where Kaneb lived is a \"gated\r\ncommunity\" populated by affluent retirees.  Prior to the initiation\r\nof the foreclosure, he socialized frequently with his neighbors. \r\nAs a widower and retiree, Kaneb's life in Florida revolved around\r\nrecreational activities within the condominium complex.  After his\r\nneighbors became aware of the legal proceedings, they stopped\r\ninviting him to social outings. \r\nKaneb brought suit for compensatory and punitive damages for\r\nwillful violation of the automatic stay in the District of\r\nMassachusetts Bankruptcy Court.  The court awarded him damages for\r\nemotional distress and attorneys' fees, and the Bankruptcy\r\nAppellate Panel affirmed.  On appeal, Fleet argues for the first\r\ntime that there was no violation of the automatic stay despite its\r\npretrial stipulation to the contrary.  Fleet seeks relief from its\r\npretrial stipulation and contests the sufficiency of the evidence\r\nof Kaneb's emotional suffering. \r\n                    II. \r\nIn examining Fleet's pretrial stipulation, we find that Fleet\r\nstipulated to a set of uncontested facts from which the bankruptcy\r\njudge found a violation of the automatic stay.  However, the\r\nstipulation merely recites historical facts.  Nowhere in the\r\nagreement does Fleet concede that, as a legal matter, it violated\r\nthe automatic stay.  Fleet's request for relief from its supposed\r\nstipulation to a violation is, in reality, a request for permission\r\nto argue a legal issue that it failed to raise below.  That is,\r\nFleet raises on appeal Judge Votolato's sua sponte argument in his\r\ndissent to the decision of the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel that\r\nthere was no violation because the foreclosure occurred after\r\nKaneb's discharge from bankruptcy and the automatic stay does not\r\napply because Kaneb excluded the Florida property from the\r\nbankruptcy estate by claiming it as exempt.  We will not address\r\nissues raised for the first time on appeal.  See Teamsters Local\r\nNo. 59 v. Superline Transp. Co., 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir. 1992)\r\n(\"If any principle is settled in this circuit, it is that, absent\r\nthe most extraordinary circumstances, legal theories not raised\r\nsquarely in the lower court cannot be broached for the first time\r\non appeal.\").  We decline to address Fleet's \"no violation\"\r\nargument.  \r\nInstead, we accept the conclusion that there was a violation\r\nof the automatic stay and review the trial court's determination\r\nthat this violation was willful.  The trial court found that,\r\n\"Despite knowing that the stay was still in force, on April 26,\r\n1996 Shawmut forwarded its file to the law firm of Shapiro &amp;\r\nFishman . . . for the purpose of initiating foreclosure on the\r\nproperty.\"  Fleet argues that this action was simply an innocent\r\nmistake.  Further, Fleet contends that its actions were not willful\r\nbecause they were not taken with \"flagrant or reckless disregard\"\r\nfor its legal obligations.\r\nFleet cites no authority for its \"flagrant or reckless\r\ndisregard\" standard and our research discloses none.  We decline to\r\ncreate a new standard for willfulness.  We similarly reject Fleet's\r\nargument that it is immune from sanctions because it made a\r\nmistake.  A good faith belief in a right to the property is not\r\nrelevant to a determination of whether the violation was willful. \r\nSee Tsafaroff v. Taylor (In re Taylor), 884 F.2d 478, 483 (9th Cir.\r\n1989), (quoting INSLAW, Inc. v. United States (In re INSLAW, Inc.),\r\n83 B.R. 89, 165 (Bankr. D.D.C. 1988)). A willful violation does not\r\nrequire a specific intent to violate the automatic stay.  The\r\nstandard for a willful violation of the automatic stay under \r\n362(h) is met if there is knowledge of the stay and the defendant\r\nintended the actions which constituted the violation.  See Goichman\r\nv. Bloom (In re Bloom), 875 F.2d 224, 227 (9th Cir. 1989); see also\r\nCrysen/Montenay Energy Co. v. Esselen Assocs., Inc. (In re\r\nCrysen/Montenay Energy Co.), 902 F.2d 1098, 1105 (2d Cir. 1990);\r\nCuffee v. Atlantic Bus. and Community Dev. Corp. (In re Atlantic\r\nBusiness and Community Corp.), 901 F.2d 325, 329 (3d Cir. 1990). \r\nIn cases where the creditor received actual notice of the automatic\r\nstay, courts must presume that the violation was deliberate.  See\r\nHomer Nat'l Bank v. Namie, 96 B.R. 652, 654 (W.D. La. 1989).  The\r\ndebtor has the burden of providing the creditor with actual notice. \r\nOnce the creditor receives actual notice, the burden shifts to the\r\ncreditor to prevent violations of the automatic stay.  See Mitchell\r\nConstr. Co., Inc. v. Smith (In re Smith), 180 B.R. 311, 319 (Bankr.\r\nN.D. Ga. 1995).  \r\nThe parties do not contest that Shawmut received actual\r\nnotice of the automatic stay.  Indeed, the record reveals that\r\nShawmut unsuccessfully filed a motion for relief from the stay. \r\nAfter the bankruptcy court's denial of the motion for relief,\r\nShawmut retained the law firm of Shapiro &amp; Fishman to initiate\r\nforeclosure proceedings.  Although Fleet received notice of a\r\nviolation when Kaneb's attorney informed Shapiro &amp; Fishman of the\r\nstay, Fleet's counsel failed to dismiss the suit for six weeks. \r\nUnder the applicable standard, Fleet's actions constitute a willful\r\nviolation of the automatic stay.\r\n                    III.\r\nFleet challenges generally the sufficiency of the evidence of\r\nharm and causation for the $25,000 award for mental anguish and\r\nargues specifically that a showing of mental anguish requires\r\nphysical injury or corroborating medical testimony.  We decline to\r\naddress Fleet's specific arguments about evidentiary requirements\r\nbecause Fleet has once again waived these arguments by failing to\r\nraise them below.  The BAP majority noted: \"Our examination of the\r\nlengthy record shows Fleet did not question the appropriateness of\r\nthe [damages award] on grounds that there was no corroborating\r\nevidence.  Therefore, Fleet is precluded from raising the issue of\r\ncorroboration now . . . .\"  Similarly, our review of the record\r\nreveals that Fleet did not raise before the lower court the\r\nargument that a plaintiff must have suffered concomitant physical\r\nharm in order to receive damages for mental anguish. \r\nIn responding to Fleet's general challenge to the sufficiency\r\nof the damages evidence, we note that emotional damages qualify as\r\n\"actual damages\" under  362(h).  See Holden v. IRS (In re Holden),\r\n226 B.R. 809, 812 (Bankr. D. Vt. 1998)(\"Emotional distress is an\r\nactual injury . . . . Legitimate human emotions are brought to bear\r\nwhen one's rights are trampled on.\"); In re Carrigan, 109 B.R. 167,\r\n170 (W.D.N.C. 1989)(\"The debtor's actual injury here is somewhat\r\nimprecise, but it is real -- and, it is certainly the result of\r\n[the creditor's actions].); but see In re McPeck, 1991 WL 8405 at\r\n*3 (Bankr. D. Minn. Jan. 29, 1991).  In the instant case, Kaneb\r\nprovided specific information about the sharp decline in social\r\ninvitations and outings following Fleet's violation of the\r\nautomatic stay rather than \"generalized assertions\" of his\r\nemotional state.  See In the Matter of Robinson, 228 B.R. 75, 85\r\n(Bankr. E.D.N.Y. 1998)(finding insufficient evidence of debtor's\r\nclaim of emotional harm based on unsworn and generalized assertion\r\nthat debtor was concerned and upset).  He then testified about the\r\nemotional distress he experienced because of these changes in his\r\nlife: \"[I]ts very irritating.  I don't sleep well.  My eating\r\nhabits have changed.  I -- I don't feel that ambitious about\r\ngetting out and doing things and meeting people.  It's -- it's not\r\na pleasant situation to be in . . . . I'm worried concerning where\r\nam I going to live.\"  An honest accounting of actual damages under\r\n362(h) must include the psychological suffering of this eighty-\r\nfive year old retired widower.  We affirm the bankruptcy court's\r\naward of damages for mental anguish.\r\n                     IV.\r\nIn his cross-appeal, Kaneb challenges the Bankruptcy Appellate\r\nPanel's deferment of an award of attorneys' fees pending appeal,\r\narguing that  362(h)'s mandate that an injured individual \"shall\r\nrecover actual damages\" requires a prompt award of attorneys' fees. \r\nFurther, Kaneb asserts that deferment of fees discourages attorneys\r\nfrom filing suits to vindicate debtors' rights under the automatic\r\nstay provision and creates a burdensome cycle of \"satellite\"\r\nappeals over fees.  However, Kaneb cites no authority for the\r\nproposition that an award by the trial court of attorneys' fees may\r\nnot be held in abeyance under  362(h) until the trial court's\r\ndetermination that there was a willful violation of the automatic\r\nstay is affirmed on appeal.  The BAP's order was within its\r\ndiscretion and not contrary to law.\r\nAffirmed.\n",

(\"Fleet\"), appeals from the order of the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel for the First Circuit affirming an award of damages and attorneys' fees by the bankruptcy court to Kenneth A. Kaneb pursuant to 11 U.S.C. &#167;362(h).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> We review directly the bankruptcy court's findings of fact and conclusions of law. See Brandt v.

The bankruptcy court found that Fleet willfully violated the automatic stay provision of the Bankruptcy Code and awarded Kaneb $25,000 for emotional distress and $18,220.68 for attorneys' fees and costs on appeal. Fleet contests the finding that the violation of the automatic stay was willful and challenges the award of damages for emotional distress. Fleet also seeks relief from its pretrial stipulation relating to a violation of the stay. We affirm the decision of the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (\"BAP\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1993, Kaneb filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code. An eighty-five year old retiree and widower, Kaneb spent the cold-weather months in Florida and the balance of the year in Massachusetts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> After the sale of his Massachusetts residence to pay secured creditors, he converted to Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Shawmut Bank, N.A. (\"Shawmut\"), was the original mortgagee of Kaneb's second residence, a Florida condominium.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shawmut sought relief from the automatic stay in order to initiate foreclosure proceedings. The bankruptcy court denied Shawmut's petition. Kaneb and Shawmut entered into settlement negotiations without success. After the failed negotiations, Shawmut forwarded Kaneb's file to the Florida law firm of Shapiro &amp; Fishman (\"Fleet's counsel\") to initiate foreclosure proceedings. Shawmut and Fleet merged on November 15, 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The file forwarded from Shawmut contained the order of discharge, dated January 31, 1996, which relieved Kaneb from personal liability for all debts dischargeable under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 523. The file also contained an unsigned order granting relief from the automatic stay. The attorney from Shapiro &amp; Fishman testified that she knew Kaneb was in bankruptcy but she thought that the unsigned order for relief from the automatic stay meant that the bankruptcy judge had granted relief. Further, she erroneously believed that Fleet could initiate foreclosure proceedings lawfully because the bankruptcy court had issued an order of discharge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> On behalf of Fleet, Shapiro &amp; Fishman filed a complaint for foreclosure in Florida state court on June 4, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after the initiation of the foreclosure, Kaneb's attorney informed Fleet's counsel of the automatic stay and faxed documents confirming this information. Fleet's counsel placed Kaneb's file on \"hold\" status. Six weeks later, in response to a letter from Kaneb strenuously protesting the violation of the automatic stay, Fleet's counsel dismissed the foreclosure suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the six weeks that Fleet allowed the foreclosure suit to languish on \"hold\" status, Kaneb's neighbors learned of the foreclosure proceeding. As a result of a foreclosure notice published in a local Florida newspaper, Kaneb received a barrage of colorful mail offering legal and investment services. These solicitations, known as \"dayglow mail,\" accumulated in Kaneb's Florida mailbox. Neighbors who regularly held his mail for him when he was in Massachusetts learned of the foreclosure action. In addition, one of Kaneb's neighbors erroneously received a solicitation addressed to Kaneb.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once Kaneb's neighbors learned of the foreclosure suit, they began to avoid him. The condominium where Kaneb lived is a \"gated community\" populated by affluent retirees. Prior to the initiation of the foreclosure, he socialized frequently with his neighbors. As a widower and retiree, Kaneb's life in Florida revolved around recreational activities within the condominium complex. After his neighbors became aware of the legal proceedings, they stopped inviting him to social outings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kaneb brought suit for compensatory and punitive damages for willful violation of the automatic stay in the District of Massachusetts Bankruptcy Court. The court awarded him damages for emotional distress and attorneys' fees, and the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel affirmed. On appeal, Fleet argues for the first time that there was no violation of the automatic stay despite its pretrial stipulation to the contrary. Fleet seeks relief from its pretrial stipulation and contests the sufficiency of the evidence of Kaneb's emotional suffering.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In examining Fleet's pretrial stipulation, we find that Fleet stipulated to a set of uncontested facts from which the bankruptcy judge found a violation of the automatic stay. However, the stipulation merely recites historical facts. Nowhere in the agreement does Fleet concede that, as a legal matter, it violated the automatic stay.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Fleet's request for relief from its supposed stipulation to a violation is, in reality, a request for permission to argue a legal issue that it failed to raise below. That is, Fleet raises on appeal Judge Votolato's sua sponte argument in his dissent to the decision of the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel that there was no violation because the foreclosure occurred after Kaneb's discharge from bankruptcy and the automatic stay does not apply because Kaneb excluded the Florida property from the bankruptcy estate by claiming it as exempt. We will not address issues raised for the first time on appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> See Teamsters Local No. 59 v. Superline Transp.

The trial court found that, \"Despite knowing that the stay was still in force, on April 26, 1996 Shawmut forwarded its file to the law firm of Shapiro &amp; Fishman . . . for the purpose of initiating foreclosure on the property.\" Fleet argues that this action was simply an innocent mistake. Further, Fleet contends that its actions were not willful because they were not taken with \"flagrant or reckless disregard\" for its legal obligations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fleet cites no authority for its \"flagrant or reckless disregard\" standard and our research discloses none. We decline to create a new standard for willfulness. We similarly reject Fleet's argument that it is immune from sanctions because it made a mistake. A good faith belief in a right to the property is not relevant to a determination of whether the violation was willful. See Tsafaroff v. Taylor (In re Taylor), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"528537\"><a href=\"/opinion/528537/in-re-ezella-m-taylor-debtor-dina-tsafaroff-evelyn-simbas-v-ezella-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">884</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span>, 483 (9th Cir. 1989), (quoting INSLAW, Inc. v.

D.D.C. 1988)). A willful violation does not require a specific intent to violate the automatic stay. The standard for a willful violation of the automatic stay under &#167; 362(h) is met if there is knowledge of the stay and the defendant intended the actions which constituted the violation.

The BAP's order was within its discretion and not contrary to law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p>Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  Section 362(h) provides: \"An individual injured by any willful violation of a stay provided by this section shall recover actual damages, including costs and attorneys' fees, and, in appropriate circumstances, may recover punitive damages.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>  Noting that appellant's counsel had agreed to delete a disputed entry of $225 for secretarial services, the Panel reduced the total award for costs and fees to $17,995.68.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Mr. Kaneb died on July 23, 1999.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p>  A discharge order \"operates as an injunction against the commencement or continuation of an action, the employment of process, or an act, to collect or recover from, or offset any [discharged] debt as a personal liability of the debtor.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 524(a)(2).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p>  The pretrial stipulation includes a series of uncontested facts relevant to the alleged stay violation: \"On November 8, 1995, Shawmut Bank, N.A., the predecessor in interest to Fleet, filed for Relief from the Automatic Stay;\" \"On December 6, 1995 this Court denied the Motion for Relief from Stay with Prejudice for failure to cooperate;\" \"On June 4, 1996 a Complaint for foreclosure was initiated by Fleet National Bank to foreclosure [sic] on the Debtor's property;\" \"On June 11, 1996 a call was made by the Plaintiff's Counsel to the Defendant's attorneys, indicating the automatic stay was still in effect;\" \"Fleet's counsel placed the Debtor's file on hold on June 11, 1996 and informed Fleet of the status of the File;\" \"On July 23, 1996, after receipt of the facsimile transmission [from Kaneb's attorney] Fleet filed a Voluntary Dismissal and Discharge of Lis Pendens Without Prejudice.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p>  Because we decline to review issues raised for the first time on appeal, we describe Judge Votolato's argument for the sake of completeness rather than addressing it on the merits.
