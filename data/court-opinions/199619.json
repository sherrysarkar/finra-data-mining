SINGLETERRY,\n\n                       Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                     FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\n\n              [Hon. Gene Carter, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n               Torruella and Selya, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Daryl E. Singleterry on brief pro se.\n     Paula D. Silsby, United States Attorney, and Margaret D.\nMcGaughey, Appellate Chief, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                         September 27,2001\n\f            Per Curiam.       Daryl E. Singleterry appeals the\n\ndistrict court's denial of his motion to dismiss Count III,\n\na forfeiture count, in his 1993 indictment and to return the\n\nforfeited money to him.           Unlike the original judgment of\n\nNovember 2, 1993, the amended judgment of July 30, 1998,\n\nentered after remand from this court, did not reference\n\nCount III.       Singleterry argued that the amended judgment's\n\nfailure   to     comply    with     Fed.   R.    Crim.      P.    32(d)(2)'s\n\nrequirement that \"a final order of forfeiture shall be made\n\npart of the sentence and included in the judgment\" revived\n\nhis opportunity to challenge the forfeiture count.                           He\n\nclaimed that, because the forfeiture count was not mentioned\n\nin the amended judgment, that count must be dismissed.                     But,\n\nhe offers no supporting case law for that proposition.\n\n            We    find    neither    error      of   law    nor    abuse    of\n\ndiscretion in the district court's denial of Singleterry's\n\nmotion to dismiss Count III.         Nothing about Count III was in\n\ndispute   either     before    or    after      entry      of    the   amended\n\njudgment.      Neither party raised any issue regarding Count\n\nIII on remand.      And, there is no evidence that the district\n\ncourt intended on remand to effect any change regarding that\n\ncount.    From aught that appears, the failure to reference\n\nCount III in the amended judgment of July 1998 was simply a\n\fclerical    oversight   in   the    preparation        of   the   amended\n\njudgment.    Such an mistake is subject to correction pursuant\n\nto Fed. R. Crim. P. 36       Cf. United States v. Loe, 248 F.3d\n\n449, 464 (5th Cir. 2001) (finding nothing objectionable\n\nabout a nunc pro tunc amendment to the judgment referencing\n\nthe forfeiture).\n\n            The   district   court's     denial   of    the   motion   to\n\ndismiss Count III is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f",
