Appellant appeals  his conviction as  well as his\r\n\nsentence on a  number of grounds.  For the  following reasons, we\r\n\naffirm  the  district  court's   judgment  and  sentence  in  all\r\n\nrespects.\r\n\n                FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r                          FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r                                                           \r\n\n          Presenting the  facts in  the light most  hospitable to\r\n\nthe jury's verdict, see United States v.

Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 711  (1st\r                                                  \r\n\nCir. 1992),  cert. denied,  506 U.S.  1063  (1993), the  evidence\r                                   \r\n\npresented during the nine-day trial tended to show the following.\r\n\n          The Galleria  II was a family-style  restaurant and pub\r\n\nserving   Italian   food   and   pizza,   located  in   Westport,\r\n\nMassachusetts  (the  \"restaurant\"),  which  was  owned  by  three\r\n\npartners: Appellant,  Robert Ashness  (\"Ashness\")  and Dr.  Louis\r\n\nAguiar  (\"Dr. Aguiar\").  The restaurant was located in a building\r\n\nwhich  Appellant and Ashness leased  from Dr. Aguiar and Fernando\r\n\nL pes  (\"L pes\").   The  lease  agreement  provided, among  other\r\n\nthings,  for  a monthly  rent of  $3,600  and an  option  for the\r\n\nrestaurant  owners to purchase L pes' share in the property.  The\r\n\nrestaurant  received natural  gas  and food  supplies that  moved\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nthrough interstate commerce.  Although very successful during the\r\n\nsummer  months of 1991, its first year of operation, the Galleria\r\n\nII's  business   proved  to  be  seasonal   and  business  slowed\r\n\nconsiderably after the summer.  In addition to the slow business,\r\n\nthere  were significant  problems with  the building's  water and\r\n\nseptic  systems and  the relationship  between Appellant  and Dr.\r\n\nAguiar  deteriorated  over who  was  responsible to  pay  for the\r\n\nrequired  improvements:  the restaurant, as tenant, or Dr. Aguiar\r\n\nand L pes, as landlords. \r\n\n          Among  the  Galleria  II's  employees,  Randy  Schaller\r\n\n(\"Schaller\") served as  chef and as kitchen  manager; and Shelley\r\n\nMcKenna (\"McKenna\") served as the bar manager and hostess and was\r\n\nalso responsible for the cash and bookkeeping.  Both Schaller and\r\n\nMcKenna  had longstanding  business relationships  with Appellant\r\n\nand  considered him  a friend.   Beginning in  the fall  of 1991,\r\n\nAppellant began discussing with  Schaller the need for renovating\r\n\nthe restaurant.  In  addition to correcting the water  and septic\r\n\nsystems,  Appellant proposed  that  an outside  roof-top deck  be\r\n\ninstalled for  the purpose of increasing liquor  sales during the\r\n\npeak  summer season.  Appellant  told Schaller that  he wanted to\r\n\nfinance  the renovations  by  burning the  top of  the restaurant\r\n\nabove  the second floor as  the insurance proceeds  from the fire\r\n\nwould provide funds for  the renovations.   As part of his  plan,\r\n\nAppellant increased the Galleria II's existing insurance coverage\r\n\n(building,   contents,  and  premises  liability)  by  purchasing\r\n\n$90,000   of  business   interruption  insurance,   which  became\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\neffective December 3, 1991, two months before the arson attempts.\r\n\nThe proceeds  from the business interruption  coverage could have\r\n\nbeen used for any purpose, including for the  repair of the water\r\n\nand septic systems.\r\n\n          On  or about  February  19, 1992,  after unsuccessfully\r\n\nattempting   to  hire  someone  else  to  burn  the  top  of  the\r\n\nrestaurant, Appellant attempted to set a fire himself by igniting\r\n\na  stack of  papers in  the attic  of the  restaurant.   The fire\r\n\nburned out,  however, before  it could  fully ignite  the exposed\r\n\nwood frame.  Both Schaller and McKenna, who had been drawn to the\r\n\nattic  because  of  the  open attic  door,  discovered  Appellant\r\n\nstanding  over the  burning stack  of papers  and refused  to get\r\n\ninvolved.  During  the days following  his first failed  attempt,\r\n\nAppellant  asked Schaller if he would help by pouring gasoline on\r\n\nthe  attic  rafters as  part of  a  plan whereby  Appellant would\r\n\nreturn later to ignite the gasoline.   After repeatedly declining\r\n\nto get involved, Schaller finally agreed to assist Appellant.  \r\n\n          Shortly  after  noon  on  February  23, 1992,  Schaller\r\n\npoured  gasoline, as  Appellant had  requested, onto  the exposed\r\n\nattic rafters and  insulation and informed Appellant  that he had\r\n\ndone so.   About mid-afternoon,  Appellant and Schaller  left the\r\n\nrestaurant.  At  approximately 4:00 p.m. that same afternoon, the\r\n\nWestport  Fire  Department  responded  to a  complaint  from  the\r\n\nrestaurant  that there  was  a strong  odor  of gas,  which  both\r\n\npatrons  and  employees at  the restaurant  had detected.   After\r\n\nevacuating   the  building,   the  firefighters   discovered  the\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\ngasoline-soaked  boards and  insulation  as well  as evidence  of\r\n\ncharring  on the attic floor and ceiling.   According to the fire\r\n\ndepartment, the charring was unrelated to the much larger area of\r\n\nthe  attic  that  was  saturated with  gasoline,  representing  a\r\n\nseparate, previous attempt to start a fire. \r\n\n          A few  days later, Schaller admitted to the police that\r\n\nhe  had  poured  the  gasoline.    Although  Appellant  told  law\r\n\nenforcement  officials  that he  would  fire  Schaller when  they\r\n\ninformed  him of  Schaller's  confession,  Appellant never  fired\r\n\nSchaller, and Schaller worked at the restaurant until it  closed.\r\n\nOn December 6,  1993, Schaller entered  a plea  of guilty to  the\r\n\nfederal indictment charging him  with the second attempted arson.\r\n\nPursuant to his plea  agreement, he agreed to cooperate  with law\r\n\nenforcement  officials.   As part  of that  cooperation, Schaller\r\n\nengaged  in  four conversations  -- three  in  person and  one by\r\n\ntelephone -- with Appellant that were recorded by law enforcement\r\n\nagents.1   In July 1994,  a two count indictment  was returned by\r\n\nthe federal grand jury charging Appellant with attempted arson of\r\n\na building affecting interstate commerce under 18 U.S.C.   844(i)\r\n\nand conspiracy to commit arson under 18 U.S.C.    371.   Prior to\r\n\ntrial,  Appellant  filed  a  motion  in  limine  to exclude  from\r                                                         \r\n\nevidence the  four recorded  conversations between  Appellant and\r\n\nSchaller,   which  included  incriminating   statements  made  by\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  The conversations  occurred on February 24, March  1, March 4,\r\nand May 25 of 1994.  \r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nAppellant.   After  a hearing,  the court  denied the  motion and\r\n\nadmitted the tapes after certain portions were excised. \r\n\n          During a  nine-day trial on  the merits, in  which nine\r\n\nwitnesses  testified for  the  prosecution  (including  Schaller,\r\n\npursuant to  his plea  agreement), the prosecution  presented its\r\n\ntheory that Appellant attempted  to burn the restaurant in  order\r\n\nto  recover  insurance  proceeds   to  finance  renovations   and\r\n\nimprovements  of  the  restaurant.    The  defense  called  three\r\n\nwitnesses, including McKenna.  Among other matters, the witnesses\r\n\ntestified that Schaller's reputation for truthfulness was \"zero;\"\r\n\nthat  the  business interruption  insurance  was  purchased as  a\r\n\nresult  of significant storms which had caused the Galleria II to\r\n\nclose; that, after  leaving with Schaller during the afternoon of\r\n\nFebruary 22,  Appellant  had no  intention  of returning  to  the\r\n\nrestaurant;  and   that  Appellant was  with  McKenna during  the\r\n\nevening of February 22, planning their  next day's business trip.\r\n\n          During the trial, Appellant moved for a mistrial, which\r\n\nwas denied, on the grounds that improper testimony regarding  his\r\n\nownership of a  \"gay night club\"  was prejudicial.   Both at  the\r\n\nclose of the government's  case-in-chief and at the close  of all\r\n\nthe evidence, Appellant  moved for judgment  of acquittal on  the\r\n\nground that the evidence was  insufficient to establish that  the\r\n\nGalleria II  was a building  affecting interstate commerce.   The\r\n\ndistrict court denied both motions.  \r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n          Based  on the  foregoing and  other evidence,  the jury\r\n\nconvicted  Appellant on  February  10, 1995,  on  both counts  of\r\n\nattempted  arson  and  conspiracy  to commit  arson.    Appellant\r\n\nsubsequently  moved  for a  new  trial which  the  district court\r\n\ndenied.   On May 25, 1995, the district court sentenced Appellant\r\n\nto a term of  seventy-eight (78) months' imprisonment, imposed  a\r\n\nfine of $12,500, restitution to the Westport Police Department in\r\n\nthe  amount of $386, and ordered supervised release for three (3)\r\n\nyears.  Appellant  appeals both his conviction  and his sentence.\r\n\nWe  have jurisdiction pursuant to  Rule 4(b) of  Federal Rules of\r\n\nAppellate Procedure. \r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\n        I.  Appellant's Motions for Judgment of Acquittal\r                  I.  Appellant's Motions for Judgment of Acquittal\r\n\n          Appellant claims reversible error  in the denial of his\r\n\nmotions  for judgment  of acquittal.   See Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 29.\r                                                    \r\n\nBelow, Appellant  based his motions for  acquittal on sufficiency\r\n\nof the evidence  grounds, which included the argument  that there\r\n\nwas  insufficient  evidence  to  prove  the  requisite  nexus  to\r\n\ninterstate  commerce  under  the  federal  arson  statute.2    On\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  The federal arson statute provides:\r\n\n            Whoever maliciously  damages or destroys,\r\n            or  attempts  to  damage or  destroy,  by\r\n            means  of  fire  or  an   explosive,  any\r\n            building,  vehicle,  or  other   real  or\r\n            personal property used  in interstate  or\r\n            foreign  commerce  or  in   any  activity\r\n            affecting interstate  or foreign commerce\r\n            . . . [is guilty of a crime].\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   844(i) (1994). \r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nappeal, he  raises new  arguments  based on  the Supreme  Court's\r\n\ndecision in United States v. L pez,     U.S.    , 115 S. Ct. 1624\r                                            \r\n\n(1995), which struck down the Gun Free School Zone Act, 18 U.S.C.\r\n\n   922(q), as  exceeding Congress'  authority under  the Commerce\r\n\nClause3 to  regulate interstate  commerce.  Appellant  now argues\r\n\nthat,  in   light  of  L pez,   the  federal  arson   statute  is\r                                      \r\n\nunconstitutional and that, accordingly, the district court lacked\r\n\nsubject  matter  jurisdiction.   In  the  alternative,  Appellant\r\n\nargues that under  L pez there is insufficient  evidence to prove\r                                  \r\n\nthat the Galleria II was a building that \"substantially affected\"\r\n\ninterstate commerce.\r\n\n          Specifically,  Appellant  now  claims  that  this  is a\r\n\nsimple state arson  case which  Congress has no  power under  the\r\n\nCommerce Clause to federalize and thereby undercut Massachusetts'\r\n\npower to prosecute Appellant  under its own arson statute,  Mass.\r\n\nGen. Laws  Ann. ch.  266,    1.   In  support  of this  argument,\r\n\nAppellant insists that  L pez effectively  overruled the  Supreme\r                                       \r\n\nCourt's earlier  decision in Russell  v. United States,  471 U.S.\r                                                                \r\n\n858, 859  (1985), which concluded that the  federal arson statute\r\n\nexpresses Congressional  intent to exercise its  full power under\r\n\nthe  Commerce Clause.

Credibility determinations  are uniquely\r\n\nwithin the jury's province; and, we defer to their determinations\r\n\nand the verdict if  the evidence can support  varying inferences.\r\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Cruz-Kuilan, 75 F.3d 59, 62 (1st Cir.\r                                                 \r\n\n1996); United States  v.

That\r\n\nthe  jury  chose  to  believe  the  testimony  presented  by  the\r\n\ngovernment, particularly  that of Schaller,  and disbelieve  that\r\n\npresented by the defense was well within its province.  \r\n\n          As part of our sufficiency  of the evidence review,  we\r\n\nmust determine  whether the  requisite jurisdictional  element is\r\n\nmet.  Because  it constitutes a  jurisdictional predicate of  the\r\n\nsubstantive  offense, this  \"jurisdictional element,\"  like other\r\n\nelements of  the offense,  must be  proved to the  jury beyond  a\r\n\nreasonable doubt.

Medeiros,  897  F.2d at  16-17.   Here,  the\r                                       \r\n\ngovernment presented uncontested evidence  that the object of the\r\n\nattempted  arsons was  a \"building\"  that was  being \"used\"  as a\r\n\ncommercial establishment,  the Galleria II restaurant.   The jury\r\n\nwas  presented  with evidence  that  Appellant  and his  partners\r\n\nrented  the building; that the building was supplied with natural\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\ngas  which   traveled  in  interstate  commerce;   and  that  the\r\n\nrestaurant  received  food  supplies   for  its  operation  which\r\n\ntraveled in  interstate commerce.  Indeed,  Appellant conceded at\r\n\noral  argument  that  the  building  was  used  as  a  commercial\r\n\nestablishment which  received food  supplies and natural  gas for\r\n\nits  operation  that  travelled  in  interstate  commerce.    The\r\n\ndistrict court correctly instructed  the jury that the government\r\n\nhad to prove  beyond a reasonable doubt that the  Galleria II was\r\n\nproperty  \"used  in  or  [sic]  affected  interstate  or  foreign\r\n\ncommerce.\"7   Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to\r\n\nthe jury verdict, this evidence  more than satisfies Medeiros' de\r                                                                           \r\n\nminimis   requirement,  and   we  therefore   reject  Appellant's\r                 \r\n\ninsufficiency of  the evidence  argument.8   See, e.g., Ryan,  41\r                                                                      \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n7  The  court further instructed  the jury: \"Interstate  commerce\r\nmeans commerce or  business between  any place in  one state  and\r\nanother place outside that state.  It also means commerce between\r\nplaces  within  the same  state,  but passing  through  any place\r\noutside that state.\"  Finally, the court stated:  \"Now, business-\r\nrelated  property,  as   opposed  to  residential  property,   is\r\nconsidered used  in or  affecting interstate or  foreign commerce\r\neven if  it has only a  de minimis affect [sic]  on interstate or\r                                            \r\nforeign  commerce.   For  example,  business-related property  is\r\nconsidered used in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce if\r\nfood or drink which  has moved in interstate or  foreign commerce\r\nis sold there, or if oil or gas which has moved in  interstate or\r\nforeign commerce is  used in  the building.\"   Appellant did  not\r\nobject to this instruction below or specifically challenge  it on\r\nappeal.\r\n\n8  We need not address Appellant's contention that our holding in\r\nMedeiros  that  the  government  need  only  show  a  de  minimis\r                                                                           \r\nconnection to interstate  commerce is invalidated  by L pez.

Rivera-G mez,  67 F.3d 993, 998 (1st  Cir. 1995)\r                                       \r\n\n(\"The  trial  judge  is  best  situated  to  make  a  battlefield\r\n\nassessment of  the  impact that  a particular  piece of  improper\r\n\ninformation may have on a jury.\"); United States v. Sep lveda, 15\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d  1161, 1184 (1st Cir.  1993) (\"Granting or  denying a motion\r\n\nfor   mistrial  is  a  matter  committed  to  the  trial  court's\r\n\ndiscretion.\"),  cert.  denied,      U.S.     ,  114 S.  Ct.  2714\r                                       \r\n\n(1994).  \r\n\n          Appellant argues  that the  district  court abused  its\r\n\ndiscretion when it denied his motion for a mistrial which he made\r\n\nafter Schaller testified that Appellant owned \"a gay night club.\"\r\n\nThe trial transcript shows that  Schaller testified on direct  as\r\n\nfollows:\r\n\n          Q:   Now,  in the beginning of the restaurant\r\n               when it first opened,  how often did you\r\n               speak  with  the  defendant   about  the\r\n               Galleria II Restaurant?\r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\n          A:   On a daily basis.\r\n\n          Q:   When you say \"daily  basis,\" was that on\r\n               the phone or in person?\r\n\n          A:   Usually in person.\r\n\n          Q:   Where was that?\r\n\n          A:   At the club that  he owns in Providence,\r\n               Gerardo's.\r\n\n          Q:   What type of club is that?\r\n\n          A:   A gay night club.\r\n\n(Transcript, Vol. 4 at 98-99).  At this point, Appellant objected\r\n\nto  the comment and moved for a  mistrial on the grounds that the\r\n\n\"comment  was completely gratuitous .  . . [a]nd  it was designed\r\n\nspecifically to, solely to[,]  inflame the passions and prejudice\r\n\nof this jury.\"  (Transcript, Vol. 4 at 99).  \r\n\n          Although the court seemed  to agree with the government\r\n\nthat  the   information  was  offered  as   \"strictly  background\r\n\ninformation,\"  the  court  was nonetheless  concerned  about  the\r\n\npossibility  that some jurors \"may  have a view  that someone who\r\n\nruns a gay bar may  not be an upstanding citizen.\"   (Transcript,\r\n\nVol. 4  at 99-100).  The  court decided to speak  with the jurors\r\n\nindividually to ascertain  (i) whether the juror  was affected by\r\n\nthe testimony in  any way;  (ii) whether the  juror would  remain\r\n\nimpartial; and (iii) whether the juror would  be able to render a\r\n\nverdict based on the  evidence and the  law as instructed by  the\r\n\ncourt, without regard to  the fact that Appellant operated  a gay\r\n\nnight club.  After every juror responded that he or she would not\r\n\nbe affected by  the testimony  in rendering his  or her  verdict,\r\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\n(Transcript, Vol. 4 at 101-12), the court concluded, \"All  right.\r\n\nI'm satisfied.\"  (Transcript, Vol. 4 at 113).  At this point, and\r\n\nwithout further  comment by counsel,  testimony resumed.   At the\r\n\nend of trial,  Appellant did not request any additional questions\r\n\nbe asked of  the jurors  or that any  additional instructions  be\r\n\ngiven. \r\n\n          Based on  the record,  and under the  guiding principle\r\n\nthat a  district court  may declare  a mistrial  only as  a \"last\r\n\nresort,\"  Sep lveda, 15 F.3d at  1184, we find  that the district\r                             \r\n\ncourt's  decision  \"was  well  within  the  broad  range  of  its\r\n\ndiscretion.\" Rivera-G mez,  67 F.3d at  999.  The  district court\r                                   \r\n\nproperly weighed the claim of impropriety and determined  that it\r\n\nwas  unfounded based  on his  voir dire  of the  jurors.   United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates  v. Hahn, 17  F.3d 502, 508  (1st Cir.  1994) (\"A mistrial\r                         \r\n\nneed  not be  allowed  absent a  clear  showing of  prejudice.\").\r\n\nMoreover, the district court acted swiftly  by polling the jurors\r\n\nimmediately after  the improper testimony.10   Sep lveda, 15 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n\nat 1185 (\"Swiftness in judicial  response is an important element\r\n\nin  alleviating prejudice  once  the  jury  has been  exposed  to\r\n\nimproper testimony.\").   The government argues  that this polling\r\n\neffectively provided a curative  instruction that the jurors were\r\n\nnot to consider evidence that Appellant operated a gay night club\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n10  In deciding  when to \"instruct the  jurors,\" the court  noted\r\nthat \"[t]he question is should  we go on now, or should  I [speak\r\nto the jurors] at this point?\"  Appellant responded that \"I think\r\nI should  know the answer.   It makes  sense to us,  doesn't it?\"\r\nThe court agreed and  spoke individually with each of  the jurors\r\nat that time. (Transcript, 4-101).  \r\n\n                               -23-\r\r\n\nin determining guilt or innocence.  Given the questions asked and\r\n\nthe  responses  received,  we   agree  that  the  district  court\r\n\n\"efficaciously  dispelled\" any  prejudicial effect  of Schaller's\r\n\nstatement by  its immediate  and thorough  response.  See  United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates  v.

Finally,\r\n\ngiven  the overwhelming  evidence of  guilt presented  during the\r\n\ntrial, the challenged testimony  was innocuous.

Appellant's Motion for a New Trial and Motion in Limine\r            III.  Appellant's Motion for a New Trial and Motion in Limine\r                                                                         \r\n\n          Third, Appellant appeals the denial of his motion for a\r\n\nnew trial, arguing that the district court  abused its discretion\r\n\nin denying his motion  in limine11 to exclude from  evidence four\r                                          \r\n\ntapes of  recorded conversations between himself  and Schaller in\r\n\nFebruary, March and May 1994.   As the motion for a  new trial is\r\n\nnot properly before  us on appeal,12 we  only address Appellant's\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n11   When  the  tapes  were  admitted  into  evidence,  Appellant\r\nreiterated  his objections  to  the admissibility  of the  tapes,\r\nwhich he  first  had  raised  in  his  motion  in  limine.    See\r                                                                           \r\nTranscript,  Vol. 5  at 48.    Thus, we  find  the present  claim\r\nproperly preserved for appeal. \r\n\n12   On  February  24, 1995,  -- fourteen  days after  the guilty\r\nverdict was rendered -- Appellant filed a motion for a new  trial\r\nand to extend time  to file supporting memorandum.   The district\r\ncourt  denied  both motions  on the  grounds  that they  were not\r\ntimely  filed pursuant to Fed.  R. Crim. P.  33 (providing, inter\r                                                                           \r\nalia, seven-day filing  period from the  guilty verdict, or  such\r              \r\ntime  as the court may  fix during the  seven-day period, \"unless\r\nbased  on the ground of newly discovered evidence\" in which event\r\nit may be filed within two  years after final judgment) and  Fed.\r\n\n                               -24-\r\r\n\nmotion  in limine.13   Appellant  argued below,  as he  does now,\r                           \r\n\nthat the tapes should  have been excluded in their  entirety from\r\n\nevidence  because  (i) their  probative  value  was substantially\r\n\noutweighed  by their prejudicial effect  under Fed. R. Evid. 403,\r\n\neven  after  certain  portions  were  redacted;  (ii)  they  were\r\n\nimproperly  admitted as  evidence  of \"other  crimes, wrongs,  or\r\n\nacts\" under Fed. R. Evid. 404(b); and (iii) portions of them were\r\n\npartially or  wholly unintelligible  which thereby  rendered them\r\n\nmore misleading than helpful.14  \r\n\n          Here, the  court listened  to the four  tapes, reviewed\r\n\ntheir respective  transcripts, and heard arguments  of counsel on\r\n\nthe  admissibility of  both the  tapes and  the transcripts.   In\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nR.  Crim. P. 45(b)  (providing that the court  may not extend the\r\ntime  for any  action under, inter  alia, Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 33).\r                                                  \r\nBecause  Appellant's  motion  was  not timely  filed  below,  and\r\nbecause his arguments on appeal  do not involve \"newly discovered\r\nevidence,\"  we do  not  address this  motion.   As  we have  held\r\nbefore,  Fed. R. Crim. P.  33 is jurisdictional  and the district\r\ncourt is  without discretion to  grant a motion  for a  new trial\r\nthat is not timely filed.  See, e.g., United States v. Rogers, 41\r                                                                       \r\nF.3d 25,  34 (1st Cir.  1994);  United  States v. Lema,  909 F.2d\r                                                                \r\n561, 565 (1st Cir. 1990). \r\n\n13  We  note that  distinguishing these two  motions is  somewhat\r\nmeaningless -- as  a practical  matter -- within  the context  of\r\nthis  case,  given  that  the same  abuse-of-discretion  standard\r\napplies  to  both  motions  and that  Appellant's  sole  argument\r\nregarding the motion for a new trial is that the court abused its\r\ndiscretion in denying the motion in limine. \r                                                    \r\n\n14  In  his motion in limine, Appellant  also sought exclusion on\r                                      \r\nthe  grounds that  portions contained inadmissible  hearsay under\r\nFed. R.  Evid. 802.   Appellant  does not  make this argument  on\r\nappeal.   We assume  the reason for  this is that,  as the record\r\nshows,  those portions  to  which Appellant  objected on  hearsay\r\ngrounds  were excised  from  the recordings  by agreement  of the\r\nparties  and the court.   In any  event, as this  argument is not\r\nproperly raised on appeal, we do not address it.\r\n\n                               -25-\r\r\n\ndenying Appellant's  motion in  limine  to exclude  the tapes  in\r                                                \r\n\ntheir entirety under Fed.  R. Evid. 403 and 404(b),  the district\r\n\ncourt  found that they were admissible as probative of the issues\r\n\nraised in the  case and  that they were  \"overall more  relevant\"\r\n\nthan prejudicial.  (Transcript,  Vol. 2 at 12-13).   The district\r\n\ncourt, however,  did allow Appellant to  make specific objections\r\n\nof  undue prejudice.    (Transcript, Vol.  2  at 13-15).    After\r\n\nhearing  argument from counsel, (Transcript, Vol. 4 at 4-47), the\r\n\ndistrict  court   agreed  with   most  of   Appellant's  specific\r\n\nobjections  and  excluded  those   portions.    With  respect  to\r\n\nAppellant's  audibility argument, the  district court  only found\r\n\nthe  March 1, 1994, tape troubling  in that it \"seems  . . . just\r\n\nwoefully inadequate  for any  reasonable  person to  understand.\"\r\n\n(Transcript, Vol. 2-17).  The  district court's concern was  that\r\n\nthe  only way to understand  the tape was  to read the transcript\r\n\nwhich  resulted in the transcript -- and the Government's view --\r\n\nbeing  given too much weight.  After considering alternatives and\r\n\nhearing  arguments from  counsel, the  district court  decided to\r\n\nadmit  the tape and allow the transcript because both parties had\r\n\nstipulated  to the accuracy of the transcript as a true rendition\r\n\nof  the recording.   (Transcript,  Vol.  2 at  4; Vol.  4 at  4).\r\n\nFinally, the  district court gave cautionary  instructions to the\r\n\njury that the tapes  were evidence but that the  transcripts were\r\n\nnot.   The district court  also ruled that  the transcripts would\r\n\n                               -26-\r\r\n\nnot  be permitted  during deliberations.15   (Transcript,  Vol. 4\r\n\nat 4-5). \r\n\n          We  turn   to  Appellant's  arguments,   reviewing  the\r\n\ndistrict court's decision to admit or exclude evidence under Fed.\r\n\nR. Evid.  403 and  404(b) for  abuse of  discretion.   See, e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nUnited States v.

Cruz-Kuilan, 75  F.3d 59, 61  (1st Cir.  1996).\r                                       \r\n\nThe  same  standard  of  review applies  regarding  the  district\r\n\ncourt's decision  to admit the tapes  over Appellant's audibility\r\n\nargument.  See  United States  v. Jadusingh, 12  F.3d 1162,  1167\r                                                     \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1994) (\"As we have held  on numerous occasions, a trial\r\n\njudge's ruling on the admission of recordings is  afforded 'broad\r\n\ndiscretion,' even  where portions  of the taped  conversation are\r\n\nunintelligible.\"). \r\n\n                     A.  The Tapes' Relevancy\r                               A.  The Tapes' Relevancy\r\n\n          Evidence is excludable under Fed. R.  Evid. 403 \"if its\r\n\nprobative  value is  substantially  outweighed by  the danger  of\r\n\nunfair  prejudice.\"16    After  reviewing  the  transcript,17  we\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n15   We note that Appellant does  not challenge on appeal the use\r\nof the transcripts. \r\n\n16  Fed. R. Evid. 403 provides in pertinent part:\r\n\n            Although   relevant,   evidence  may   be\r\n            excluded  if  its   probative  value   is\r\n            substantially outweighed by the danger of\r\n            unfair   prejudice,   confusion  of   the\r\n            issues,  or  misleading the  jury,  or by\r\n            considerations of undue  delay, waste  of\r\n            time,   or   needless   presentation   of\r\n            cumulative evidence.\r\n\n                               -27-\r\r\n\nfind no abuse of  discretion in the district court's  decision to\r\n\nnot  exclude the  tapes in  their entirety.   In  support  of his\r\n\nargument,  Appellant  claims   that  (i)   none  of   Appellant's\r\n\nstatements prove  any  element  of the  alleged  crimes  or  show\r\n\nconsciousness  of guilt;  (ii)  the recorded  conversations  took\r\n\nplace two years after the predicate offenses occurred; (iii) many\r\n\nof  Appellant's  arguments were  made  in  response to  questions\r\n\ninstigated  by the  government  witness; and,  (iv) any  relevant\r\n\nconversations  were   intertwined  with  others  that   were  not\r\n\nrelevant.  We find none of these arguments persuasive.\r\n\n          As the district court  found, the tapes included highly\r\n\nprobative evidence regarding  Appellant's consciousness of guilt,\r\n\nincluding admissions.   The tapes were  directly relevant to  the\r\n\ngovernment's theory regarding both Appellant's involvement in the\r\n\nattempted  arson and  the  conspiracy.    Indeed,  we  note  that\r\n\nAppellant's counsel conceded  as much during  the hearing on  the\r\n\ntapes' admissibility:  \"I concede,  Judge, that there  were parts\r\n\nthat, given the Government's position and its interpretation, are\r\n\nrelevant.\" (Transcript, Vol. 2 at 12). \r\n\n          For  example, the  February 24,  1994, tape  includes a\r\n\nconversation regarding the payment of Schaller's legal fees.  Not\r\n\nonly  did  it  corroborate Schaller's  testimony  that  Appellant\r\n\nassisted  in   the  payment   of  Schaller's  legal   fees,  this\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n17    Because  the parties  stipulated  to  the  accuracy of  the\r\ntranscripts  as true recordings  of the tapes, we  do not need to\r\nactually listen  to the tapes.   In any event, we  note that they\r\nwere not made part  of the district court record  nor included as\r\npart of the record on appeal.\r\n\n                               -28-\r\r\n\nconversation included evidence from which the jury could draw  an\r\n\ninference \"that this money is  being paid because these gentlemen\r\n\nwere  in on the deal together.\"  (Transcript,  Vol. 4 at 9).  The\r\n\nMarch  1, 1994, tape includes  an admission by  Appellant that he\r\n\nthrew matches to  light the fire during the first  attempt:  \"You\r\n\nweren't there  when I  threw the  [expletive]  matches the  first\r\n\ntime.\"  The March 4, 1994, tape includes an adoptive admission by\r\n\nAppellant  regarding his attempts to burn the restaurant during a\r\n\nconversation about whether Appellant  had told anyone about those\r\n\nefforts.   While Appellant denies telling anybody  else about his\r\n\nefforts, he  responds  to Schaller's  questions directly  without\r\n\never disputing the veracity of what Schaller's questions imply --\r\n\nthat  Appellant  \"tried to  burn it.\"    The May  25,  1994, tape\r\n\nprovides  evidence  of  the   conspiracy  between  Schaller   and\r\n\nAppellant.   The  conversation demonstrates  that, although  they\r\n\nwere confused as to  their recollection of what they  believed to\r\n\nbe their respective roles, they clearly had conspired to burn the\r\n\nrestaurant.   This  sampling of  each of  the four  tapes clearly\r\n\nshows  that,  contrary  to  Appellant's  claims,  the  recordings\r\n\ninclude statements  by Appellant  that are directly  probative of\r\n\nboth attempts and the conspiracy.\r\n\n          Appellant  also points  to the  fact that  the recorded\r\n\nconversations  occurred two  years  after  the alleged  offenses,\r\n\narguing that the recordings  are neither closely intertwined with\r\n\nthe charged  offenses  nor helpful  in  establishing  Appellant's\r\n\nintent  to commit the crimes  charged.

Here,  as we\r\n\ndiscuss below, no evidence of prior bad acts was admitted in this\r\n\ncase; and, because Appellant  has not cited to any  cases holding\r\n\nthat  proximity  in  time   is  a  prerequisite  for  determining\r\n\nrelevance under  Fed.

See, e.g.,  United States v.

As\r                             \r\n\ndiscussed above,  while they do not  necessarily show Appellant's\r\n\nintent  to  commit  the  attempted  arson  or  to  enter  into  a\r                \r\n\nconspiracy, they  do show Appellant's consciousness  of guilt and\r\n\ncomplicity  as  well  as the  existence  of  a  conspiracy.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nPerkins, 926 F.2d at 1279-80.\r                 \r\n\n                               -31-\r\r\n\n          While  not   all  evidence  with  probative   value  is\r\n\nadmissible,  we do  not  find that  its  value is  \"substantially\r\n\noutweighed by the  danger of  unfair prejudice.\"   Fed.

In reviewing  the  balancing undertaken  by  the district\r\n\ncourt, we give great deference to the  district court's judgment,\r\n\nand  \"[o]nly in  exceptional  circumstances will  we reverse  the\r\n\nexercise of a district  court's informed discretion vis- -vis the\r\n\nrelative  weighing of  probative value  and unfairly  prejudicial\r\n\neffect.\"    Currier, 836  F.2d at  18  (quoting United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nGriffin, 818 F.2d 97,  101-02 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,  484 U.S.\r                                                                \r\n\n844 (1987)).   Based on our review of the record,  we do not find\r\n\nthat  the probative  value of  the  tapes --  as edited19  -- was\r\n\noutweighed by  unfairly prejudicial evidence.   See, e.g., United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Mu oz, 36 F.3d 1229, 1233 (1st  Cir. 1994) (noting that\r                         \r\n\nthe  question  under Rule  403 is  one  of unfair  prejudice, not\r\n\nprejudice alone); Currier, 836  F.2d at 18 (\"Unfairly prejudicial\r                                   \r\n\nevidence  is evidence . .  . that 'triggers  [the] mainsprings of\r\n\nhuman action [in  such a way as  to] cause the  jury to base  its\r\n\ndecision on  something other than the  established proposition in\r\n\nthe  case.'\") (quoting  1 Weinstein's  Evidence    403[03], 36-39\r\n\n(1986)).   Neither the fact that many of Appellant's remarks were\r\n\nmade  in  response to  questions  or comments  by  the government\r\n\nwitness, nor  that relevant  conversations were  intertwined with\r\n\nnon-relevant ones, persuades us  to reach a different conclusion.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n19  As mentioned above, after hearing arguments from counsel, the\r\ndistrict  court agreed to  excise most of  the portions regarding\r\nwhich Appellant raised specific objections.  \r\n\n                               -32-\r\r\n\nEven  the  fact that  the  recordings reveal  that  Appellant had\r\n\ninitially wanted to hire \"a guy from organized crime so to speak\"\r\n\nto  burn  the restaurant,  (Transcript, Vol.  4  at 32),  or that\r\n\nAppellant tells Schaller  what to say about pouring the gasoline,\r\n\n(Transcript,  Vol.  4  at  44),  does  not   make  them  unfairly\r\n\nprejudicial.  Finally,  we  do  not find  that  any  \"exceptional\r\n\ncircumstances\"20  exist which  warrant reversal  of  the district\r\n\ncourt's rulings.21   \r\n\n              B.  The Tapes' Prior Bad Act Evidence\r                        B.  The Tapes' Prior Bad Act Evidence\r\n\n          We find Appellant's reliance on Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) to\r\n\nbe  irrelevant on  appeal.22   While the  transcript of  the pre-\r\n\ntrial hearing regarding the admissibility of the tapes shows that\r\n\nthere  were  references to  previous  fires  which arguably  fall\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n20   We note that Appellant  does not specify on  appeal that any\r\n\"exceptional circumstances\" exist.  \r\n\n21  Because  we find that  the district court  did not abuse  its\r\ndiscretion,  we need not decide whether the admission of the tape\r\nrecordings -- even if an error -- was nonetheless harmless.\r\n\n22  Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) provides in pertinent part:\r\n\n            Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts\r\n            is not admissible  to prove the character\r\n            of a  person in  order to show  action in\r\n            conformity therewith.   It may,  however,\r\n            be admissible for other purposes, such as\r\n            proof  of  motive,  opportunity,  intent,\r\n            preparation,  plan,  knowledge, identity,\r\n            or  absence  of   mistake  or   accident,\r\n            provided   that   upon  request   by  the\r\n            accused,  the  prosecution in  a criminal\r\n            case shall provide  reasonable notice  in\r\n            advance of  trial, or during trial if the\r\n            court  excuses  pretrial  notice on  good\r\n            cause shown, of the general nature of any\r\n            such evidence it intends to  introduce at\r\n            trial.\r\n\n                               -33-\r\r\n\nwithin  Fed.

Not only  does Appellant not specify\r\n\non  appeal what  \"other crimes,  wrongs, or  acts\" under  Fed. R.\r\n\nEvid. 404(b) were erroneously admitted into evidence,  we find no\r\n\nmention  of any in the portions that were admitted into evidence.\r\n\nAccordingly, we do not address this argument further.\r\n\n                    C.

The Tapes' Audibility\r\n\n          Lastly,  as  to  Appellant's  audibility  argument,  in\r\n\nexercising its broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility of\r\n\ntape  recordings, even where  portions are  unintelligible, Font-\r                                                                           \r\n\nRam rez,  944 F.2d at 47, the district court \"must decide whether\r                 \r\n\n'the inaudible parts are  so substantial as to make the rest more\r\n\nmisleading  than  helpful.'\"   Id.  (citations  omitted) (quoting\r                                            \r\n\nGorin  v.

While the  district court  found\r                \r\n\nthat there were segments  of poor audio and static,  the district\r\n\ncourt  nonetheless decided to admit them.  The district court was\r\n\nswayed by the fact that the parties stipulated to the accuracy of\r\n\nthe  transcript  as a  true  recording of  the  tapes.23   We are\r\n\nsimilarly  swayed  and  find  no  abuse  of  the   court's  broad\r\n\ndiscretion, even as  to the March 1,  1994, tape about which  the\r\n\ndistrict court was most  concerned.  Based  on our review of  the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n23   Inaudible  segments were  indicated  in the  transcript with\r\nparentheticals, such as \"static\" or \"unintelligible.\" \r\n\n                               -34-\r\r\n\ntranscript,24  we  disagree  with   Appellant's  claim  that  the\r\n\ninaudible parts, when taken as a whole, were so substantial as to\r\n\nmake  the   rest  more  misleading  than   helpful,  because  the\r\n\ntranscript clearly  evidences  that sufficient  portions  of  the\r\n\ntapes, including  statements by both Schaller  and Appellant, are\r\n\naudible.    As discussed  earlier,  these  segments are  relevant\r\n\nbecause  they  include,  inter  alia,  admissions  by  Appellant,\r                                              \r\n\ntending  to show  consciousness  of guilt  and corroborate  trial\r\n\ntestimony.   Furthermore,  the district  court gave  a cautionary\r\n\ninstruction  to the  jury that  not only  informed them  that the\r\n\ntapes, but not the  transcript, were evidence, but also  that the\r\n\njurors had to draw their own conclusions regarding  their content\r\n\nand  probative value based on  what they themselves  heard on the\r\n\ntapes.25   United States  v. Carbone, 798  F.2d 21,  26 (1st Cir.\r                                              \r\n\n1986) (finding that the judge's handling of the transcript was in\r\n\naccord  with  the  law where  the  record  shows  that the  judge\r\n\ncarefully  instructed   the  jurors  that  the   tapes,  not  the\r\n\ntranscripts, were  evidence and that any  differences between the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n24    See  n.17, supra.    In  ruling  on Appellant's  audibility\r                                \r\nargument, we  add only this:   By not including the  tapes in the\r\nrecord on appeal, Appellant forfeited the right to their review.\r\n\n25   We also  note that  as to the  one disputed  sentence in the\r\ntranscript (whether Appellant said \"I am aware  of that\" or \"I am\r\nnot  aware of  that\",  (Transcript, Vol.  4  at 23)),  the  court\r\nallowed   two  versions  of  the  page  to  be  included  in  the\r\ntranscript, informed the jury that the parties were in dispute as\r\nto   what  Appellant   actually  said   on  that   page  (without\r\nspecifically identifying the disputed sentence), and gave another\r\ncautionary instruction that they  were to make their  own finding\r\nbased  on what  they heard  on the  tapes.   The jury  heard that\r\nsegment  twice, each time while reading along with the respective\r\nversions.

Based on the  record, and particularly  in light of\r\n\nAppellant's stipulation  to the accuracy  of the transcript  as a\r\n\ntrue  recording of the tapes,  we find no  abuse of discretion by\r\n\nthe  district  court  in  admitting the  tapes  over  Appellant's\r\n\naudibility objection.\r\n\n                    IV.

Thompson, 32 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1994). \r                            \r\n\n           A.  The \"Fraud or Deceit\" Base Offense Level\r                     A.  The \"Fraud or Deceit\" Base Offense Level\r\n\n          First,  Appellant  contends  that  the  district  court\r\n\nshould  have  applied  U.S.S.G.     2K1.4(a)(3),  which  requires\r\n\ncomputation of the base offense level  as 2 plus the base offense\r\n\nlevel  for  \"Fraud  and  Deceit.\"    Appellant  argues  that  the\r\n\noverwhelming  evidence  at  trial established  that  his  primary\r\n\n                               -37-\r\r\n\npurpose was to defraud the insurance company and that  Appellant,\r\n\nwhile creating some  risk of  death or serious  bodily injury  by\r\n\npouring gasoline,  did not  knowingly create a  substantial risk.\r\n\nWhile  the record does indicate  that Appellant participated in a\r\n\nscheme  to defraud the  insurance company,  we conclude  that the\r\n\ndistrict court properly chose subparagraph   2K1.4(a)(1) based on\r\n\nits  specific  finding --  which, as  we  discuss below,  was not\r\n\nclearly  erroneous   --  that   Appellant  knowingly   created  a\r\n\nsubstantial risk  of death  or serious  bodily injury  to persons\r\n\nother  than the participants in the attempted arson.  See Grimes,\r                                                                          \r\n\n967 F.2d at  1472 (holding that district  court properly rejected\r\n\napplication  of  fraud  guideline,    2K1.4(a)(3),  and  properly\r\n\napplied    2K1.4(a)(2)  in case  involving defendant's  effort to\r\n\nobtain   insurance   through   arson   where   defendant  created\r\n\nsubstantial  risk  of  injury or  death).    The  arson guideline\r\n\ninstructs that the base offense level  is determined by selecting\r\n\nthe  highest level from among four choices.  Section 2K1.4(a)(1)-\r\n\n(4); United  States v. Mizrachi, 48 F.3d 651, 655 (2d Cir. 1995).\r                                         \r\n\nThe Government  contends that  applying   2K1.4(a)(3)  would only\r\n\nyield  a base  offense  level  of  19, less  than  that  under   \r\n\n2K1.4(a)(1), which  is  24.    Appellant does  not  dispute  this\r\n\ncalculation   or  otherwise   present  his   own      2K1.4(a)(3)\r\n\ncalculation,  nor was there  any discussion of  this issue during\r\n\nthe  sentencing  hearing.    Assuming,   without  deciding,  that\r\n\ncalculation under    2K1.4(a)(3) would  have yielded only  a base\r\n\noffense  level  of  19,  we  conclude  that  the  district  court\r\n\n                               -38-\r\r\n\ncorrectly applied    2K1.4(a)(1)  because it yielded  the highest\r\n\nbase offense level based on  its finding that Appellant knowingly\r\n\ncreated  a substantial risk of  bodily injury.   Cf. Mizrachi, 48\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d  at  656  (affirming   district  court's  application  of   \r\n\n2K1.4(a)(3) in  sentencing defendant  for arson, mail  fraud, and\r\n\nmoney  laundering offenses  where facts  yielded an  initial base\r\n\noffense level of 35).\r\n\n            B.  Knowing Creation of a Substantial Risk\r                      B.  Knowing Creation of a Substantial Risk\r\n\n          Second,  Appellant  argues  that the  district  court's\r\n\nfinding that  Appellant knowingly  created a substantial  risk of\r\n\ndeath  or  serious  bodily injury  to  any  person  other than  a\r\n\nparticipant in the offense is not supported by a preponderance of\r\n\nthe  evidence.     Whether   a  defendant  knowingly   created  a\r\n\nsubstantial  risk of death  or serious  bodily injury  within the\r\n\nmeaning of section  2K1.4 of  the Guidelines raises  an issue  of\r\n\nfirst impression in that this court has not previously determined\r\n\nwhat level of knowledge  is required under   2K1.4(a)(1)(A).   At\r\n\nthe outset, we  note that this determination  involves a two-step\r\n\ninquiry.   A court must first ask whether the defendant's actions\r\n\ncreated  a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury and\r\n\nthen  decide whether  the defendant  acted knowingly  in creating\r\n\nthat risk.   See United States  v. Karlic,  997 F.2d 564,  568-69\r                                                   \r\n\n(9th  Cir. 1993) (stating that the first inquiry is objective and\r\n\nthe second is subjective). \r\n\n                  1.  The Substantial Risk . . .\r                            1.  The Substantial Risk . . .\r\n\n                               -39-\r\r\n\n          Leaving aside the question of knowledge for the moment,\r\n\nwe conclude first that  the district court did not clearly err in\r\n\nfinding that  Appellant created a  substantial risk  of death  or\r\n\nserious bodily injury to  any person other than a  participant in\r\n\nthe offense.  The  district court based its finding  primarily on\r\n\nthe  PSR,  which  indicated, inter  alia,  that  the  presence of\r                                                  \r\n\ngasoline  created   the  potential  for  a   fire  or  explosion.\r\n\nAccording  to the PSR, a  fuel air explosion  could have occurred\r\n\nhad \"a heat source been introduced within a specific danger range\r\n\nbetween the  place where  the  gasoline was  poured and  anyplace\r\n\nwithin the  building where  the odor  of gasoline  was detected,\"\r\n\n(PSR, at  22), and  that \"because the  gasoline was  poured in  a\r\n\nconfined area which  contained electrical outlets,  an electrical\r\n\nspark or other heat source  could have ignited the vapors in  the\r\n\nconfined  area at any time,\" (PSR, at 23).  Although the evidence\r\n\nindicates that Appellant  only planned to  ignite the fire  after\r\n\nthe  restaurant closed,  the  district court  concluded that  the\r\n\npotential  for a  fuel  air  explosion or  for  a fire  to  start\r\n\naccidentally  created  a substantial  risk  of  death or  serious\r\n\nbodily injury to the occupants of the building at the time of the\r\n\npouring of the gasoline in the  attic as well as to  firefighters\r\n\nand others who would respond to the incident.  \r\n\n          We find no clear error  in this finding of  substantial\r\n\nrisk to patrons and  firefighters.  It was properly based on both\r\n\nthe PSR and the sentencing judge's  common sense understanding --\r\n\nwhich  Appellant  conceded  during  the  sentencing  hearing  was\r\n\n                               -40-\r\r\n\nappropriate -- of the risks associated with pouring an accelerant\r\n\nto  start a  fire in  an occupied  building where  there  was the\r\n\npotential for  a fuel  air explosion  to occur or  for a  fire to\r\n\nstart accidentally.   See Medeiros,  897 F.2d at  20 (relying  on\r                                            \r\n\ncommon  sense  in finding  under  earlier  arson guidelines  that\r\n\ndefendant conspired  \"to cause the  kind of fire  that recklessly\r\n\nwould endanger others.\").  As the  district court correctly noted\r\n\nin  response to  Appellant's insistence  that  there was  no risk\r\n\ncreated   because   no   fire  actually   occurred,   (Sentencing\r\n\nTranscript, pages  19-22), the Guidelines speak of  \"risk.\"  \"The\r\n\nfact that  fortuitously no one  was injured and  extensive damage\r\n\ndid  not result [because no fire  or explosion actually occurred]\r\n\ndoes  not further [A]ppellant's contention that he  did not . . .\r\n\ncreate  a substantial risk  of death  or serious  bodily injury.\"\r\n\nUnited States v. Honeycutt, 8 F.3d 785, 787 (11th Cir. 1993).\r                                    \r\n\n          Furthermore, in light of  the federal arson guidelines'\r\n\ncommentary,  see U.S.S.G.   2K1.4, Application Note 2, we find no\r                          \r\n\nclear error in  the district court's finding  of substantial risk\r\n\ngiven  its finding  that firefighters \"could  have been  blown to\r\n\nsmithereens\" had a spark  ignited the gasoline vapors (Sentencing\r\n\nTranscript, at 20).  See, e.g., Turner, 995 F.2d at 1365; Grimes,\r                                                                          \r\n\n967  F.2d  at 1471.    While \"all  fires present  some  danger to\r\n\nfirefighters  required  to  extinguish  it,  .  .   .  [w]here  a\r\n\nspectacular fire  is planned near an occupied building, a finding\r\n\nof  reckless  endangerment to  firefighters would  be based  on a\r\n\ncommon  sense understanding of the  risks of putting  out a major\r\n\n                               -41-\r\r\n\nfire when rescue attempts are likely to be necessary.\"  Medeiros,\r                                                                          \r\n\n897  F.2d at 20.  Similarly, here,  although there is no evidence\r\n\nthat  Appellant  planned  a  \"spectacular fire,\"  the  sentencing\r\n\njudge's finding of substantial risk in this case was based on his\r\n\n-- and,  again, our  --  common sense understanding of  the risks\r\n\nassociated with  using an accelerant  in an occupied  building to\r\n\nstart  a fire  where  there  was the  potential  for a  fuel  air\r\n\nexplosion to occur or for a fire to start accidentally.27\r\n\n                   2.  . . . Knowingly Created\r                             2.  . . . Knowingly Created\r\n\n          Next, we must decide whether the district court clearly\r\n\nerred  when  it  found  that  Appellant  knowingly  created  this\r                                                            \r\n\nsubstantial risk.   While we  review the court's  factual finding\r\n\nfor  clear  error,  the definition  of  a  Guidelines  term is  a\r\n\nquestion of law which  we review de novo.   Mart nez-Mart nez, 69\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d at 1224.\r\n\n          Looking  first  to the  statute, we  note that  the two\r\n\nhighest  base offense  levels  in the  federal arson  guidelines,\r\n\n  2K1.4(a)(1)  and      2K1.4(a)(2),  contain   almost  identical\r\n\nlanguage.  The latter, for which there is a base offense level of\r\n\n20, applies to  the creation of  a substantial risk  of death  or\r\n\nserious bodily  injury.   The former, for  which there is  a base\r\n\noffense level of  24, applies to the  knowing creation of such  a\r\n\nrisk.    This structure  clearly suggests  that  there must  be a\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n27   In  Medeiros, we  affirmed the  district court's  finding of\r                           \r\n\"reckless endangerment\"  under the earlier arson  guidelines.  We\r\nconsider  the facts supporting such a finding to be relevant to a\r\nfinding of \"substantial risk\" under the amended guidelines.\r\n\n                               -42-\r\r\n\nmeaningful distinction between the  two sections.  See Honeycutt,\r                                                                          \r\n\n8  F.3d at 787 (noting that \"[c]learly  it was intended for there\r\n\nto  be a  distinction between  the two  sections\").28   Given the\r\n\nstructure   of  the   arson  guidelines,   we  conclude   that   \r\n\n2K1.4(a)(1)(A) requires  that the district court  make a specific\r\n\nfinding that the defendant \"knowingly\" created a substantial risk\r\n\nof death or serious  bodily injury, as opposed to  merely finding\r\n\nthat defendant  recklessly (or  negligently) created such  a risk\r\n\nwhich  would   more  appropriately   trigger  application   of   \r\n\n2K1.4(a)(1)(B).      Apart  from   this   rather  straightforward\r\n\nobservation,   no  guidance  is   gleaned  from   the  Sentencing\r\n\nGuidelines,  as \"knowingly\"  is  not defined.   In  addition, the\r\n\nusual rule  of  giving  an undefined  statutory  term  its  plain\r\n\nmeaning provides little direction given that \"'[k]nowledge' means\r\n\ndifferent  things  in  different  contexts.\"   United  States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nSpinney, 65 F.3d 231, 236 (1st Cir. 1995).\r                 \r\n\n          Our own precedent is of little help because, while this\r\n\ncourt  has  addressed  the   application  of  the  federal  arson\r\n\nguidelines,  see  Medeiros,  897  F.2d  at  18  (applying  former\r                                    \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n28  In discussing   2K1.4's  application note about firefighters,\r\nthe  Honeycutt   court  concluded   that  knowledge  alone   that\r                        \r\nfirefighters  will respond to a fire \"cannot suffice to satisfy  \r\n2K1.4(a)(1).\"   The court  reasoned that  if that knowledge  were\r\nalone sufficient  then    2K1.4(a)(2) (creation of  a substantial\r\nrisk of death or  serious bodily injury)  would be subsumed by   \r\n2K1.4(a)(1) (knowing creation of that risk).  As the court noted,\r\n\"fires  are  inherently   dangerous,  and   the  knowledge   that\r\nfirefighters  and emergency  personnel respond  to  virtually all\r\nfires can ordinarily  be presumed.\"   Honeycutt, 8  F.3d at  787.\r                                                         \r\n\"The  arsonist must  know that  a specific  fire for  some reason\r\nposes a substantial  risk of  death or serious  bodily injury  to\r\nfirefighters and emergency personnel who may respond.\"  Id.\r                                                                     \r\n\n                               -43-\r\r\n\nU.S.S.G.    2K1.4(b)(2)  and affirming  district court's  finding\r\n\nthat defendant  \"recklessly endangered  the safety  of another\");\r\n\nsee also, United States v.

See Honeycutt, 8 F.3d at 787; United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nKarlic, 997  F.2d 564,  569 (9th  Cir. 1993).   Drawing from  the\r                \r\n\nMPC's  definition,29 the  Ninth  Circuit held  that \"a  defendant\r\n\ncan  be found to have  'knowingly' created a  substantial risk of\r\n\ndeath  or serious  bodily  injury  under     2K1.4  only  if  the\r\n\ndefendant was aware that  a substantial risk of death  or serious\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n29   The Model  Penal Code's  definition of  \"knowingly\" provides\r\nthat:\r\n\n            A person acts knowingly with respect to a\r\n            material element of an offense  when: . .\r\n            . \r\n            (ii) if the element involves a  result of\r\n            his  conduct,  he  is aware  that  it  is\r\n            practically certain that his conduct will\r\n            cause such a result.\r\n\nModel Penal Code    2.02(2)(b) (1985).

We  note that other courts have neither  explicitly\r\n\ndefined \"knowingly\" nor adopted the MPC's  definition, apparently\r\n\nfinding  it unnecessary  where the  district court  could clearly\r\n\nconclude from  the facts whether  the defendant knew  his actions\r\n\ncreated a substantial  risk of  death or  serious bodily  injury.\r\n\nFor example,  in United States v.  Markum, 4 F.3d 891  (10th Cir.\r                                                   \r\n\n1993),  the  court found  that a  fire  set with  gasoline during\r\n\nbusiness hours which put  firefighters in severe jeopardy because\r\n\nof the ferocity of the fire and the risk of explosion constituted\r\n\n\"circumstances [which]  more than justified  the district court's\r\n\nfinding  that [defendant], as a co-conspirator, knowingly created\r\n\na  substantial risk of  death or serious bodily  injury.\"  Id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n896-97.  Similarly,  in United  States v. Turner,  995 F.2d  1357\r                                                          \r\n\n(6th Cir.), cert.  denied, 114  S. Ct. 282  (1993), the  district\r                                   \r\n\ncourt concluded  that defendant's actions could  fit under either\r\n\n  2K1.4(a)(1)(A) or  (B).  As  to the defendant's  knowledge, the\r\n\ncourt found that defendant knowingly created the substantial risk\r\n\ngiven  that  people in  the  residence  adjacent to  the  burning\r\n\nbuilding  were likely  to  be asleep  and windy  conditions would\r\n\ncause the  fire to spread  quickly.  Id. at  1365.  The  court in\r                                                  \r\n\nTurner  also found that defendant \"should have known\" that he was\r                \r\n\nplacing  firefighters at  a  substantial risk  by committing  the\r\n\narson  in weather  conditions that  would make  extinguishing the\r\n\nfire extremely difficult.

In terms of this continuum,  \"practical\r\n\ncertainty\"  would seem  most  akin to  \"actual  knowledge.\"   Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\n(noting  that   \"[a]ctual  knowledge,  after   all,  is   certain\r\n\nknowledge\").    We are  inclined to  conclude  that a  showing of\r\n\nknowledge anywhere  along this continuum satisfies application of\r\n\n   2K1.4(a)(1)(A).30   This  approach  would  be consistent  both\r\n\nwith  the guidelines'  mandate that  a meaningful  distinction be\r\n\nmade between the two highest base offense levels as  well as with\r\n\nthe  \"common  sense\"  approach  we endorsed  in  Medeiros.    See\r                                                                           \r\n\nMedeiros, 897 F.2d at 20.  That said, however,  at this  juncture\r                  \r\n\nwe  need not  definitively resolve  what level  of knowledge,  in\r\n\naddition  to  \"actual knowledge,\"  is  required.

In arriving at our conclusion, we\r\n\nnote that  facts contained in a presentence report ordinarily are\r\n\nconsidered reliable evidence for sentencing purposes.  See United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates  v. Morillo,  8 F.3d  870, 872 (1st  Cir. 1993).   Indeed,\r                            \r\n\n                               -47-\r\r\n\ndistrict courts possess \"broad  discretion to determine what data\r\n\nis, or is  not, sufficiently  dependable to be  used in  imposing\r\n\nsentence.\"   United States v.  Tardiff, 969 F.2d  1283, 1287 (1st\r                                                \r\n\nCir.  1992).  This is particularly true where, as here, Appellant\r\n\noffered no evidence to suggest  an inaccuracy in the  presentence\r\n\nreport's facts.  Id., 8 F.3d at 873 (collecting cases).\r                              \r\n\n          The  record  shows  that,  at  the time  of  the  first\r\n\nattempt,31  Appellant knew  that  at least  two other  employees,\r\n\nincluding Schaller (who at that time was not a participant in the\r\n\noffense),  were in  the restaurant.   As  the court  in Honeycutt\r                                                                           \r\n\nnoted, \"[i]t  is difficult to  imagine a clearer  illustration of\r\n\nthe  knowing creation of a  substantial risk of  death or serious\r\n\nbodily injury.\"   Honeycutt, 8 F.3d at 787 (affirming application\r                                     \r\n\nof   2K1.4(a)(1)(A) where defendant threw a Molotov cocktail at a\r\n\nstructure  that he admitted he  knew was occupied).   In terms of\r\n\nour continuum, this strikes us as constituting \"actual knowledge\"\r\n\nand/or \"practical certainty.\"\r\n\n          At the  time of  the second  attempt, the  record shows\r\n\nthat gasoline was poured, hours before the intended ignition,  in\r\n\na confined  area atop the Galleria II at a time when both patrons\r\n\nand  employees were inside.  Appellant knew gasoline was a highly\r\n\nflammable liquid and  he arranged  for it  to be  poured for  the\r\n\nspecific  intent of  lighting a  fire after  business hours.   In\r\n\nresponse  to  Appellant's  \"practical  certainty\"  argument,  the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n31   We address the first  count (the attempt to start  a fire in\r\nthe  attic with paper) even though Appellant's brief only focuses\r\non the second count (involving the gasoline). \r\n\n                               -48-\r\r\n\ndistrict court found that \"the fact that [Appellant] . . . wanted\r\n\nto [ignite] the fire  outside of business hours,  suggests . .  .\r\n\nthat he  knew of the risk\"  to people inside the  building and to\r\n\nthose who would respond  to the fire.  (Sentencing  Transcript at\r\n\n18).   Contrary  to Appellant's  contentions, these  findings are\r\n\nsufficient for the application of the highest base offense level.\r\n\nWhile  Appellant may not have been aware that it was \"practically\r\n\ncertain\"  that  a fire  could  ignite  accidentally  or that  the\r                                                             \r\n\nrestaurant  and any  occupants could  be blown  to \"smithereens,\"\r\n\n(Sentencing Transcript  at 20),  we  remind Appellant  -- as  the\r\n\ndistrict court did more than once -- that the guidelines call for\r\n\nthe  knowing   creation  of  a   substantial  risk.     Here,   a\r                                                            \r\n\npreponderance of the evidence supports the finding that Appellant\r\n\nwas  aware that  a substantial  risk of  death or  serious bodily\r\n\ninjury  was \"practically  certain\" to  result from  the use  of a\r\n\nhighly  flammable accelerant  for  purposes of  starting a  fire.\r\n\nAppellant presented no evidence to rebut the preponderance of the\r\n\nevidence  presented   on  this  point.     Furthermore,  we  find\r\n\nirrelevant  whether or  not  Appellant was  \"practically certain\"\r\n\nthat an  accidental ignition  would occur  given that  the record\r                             \r\n\nsupports  a finding that he was \"practically certain\" that he was\r\n\ncreating a substantial  risk of death  or serious bodily  injury.\r                                      \r\n\nFinally, the district court  again correctly rejected Appellant's\r\n\nargument that he did  not knowingly create a risk because no fire\r\n\nor explosion actually  occurred.   See Honeycutt, 8  F.3d at  787\r                                                          \r\n\n(\"[t]he fact that  fortuitously no one was injured  and extensive\r\n\n                               -49-\r\r\n\ndamage did  not result does not  further [A]ppellant's contention\r\n\nthat he did not knowingly create a substantial risk.\").  At issue\r\n\nis  Appellant's  state of  mind, not  the  actual results  of his\r\n\nactions.   Id.; cf. Medeiros,  897 F.2d at  20 (finding that  the\r                                      \r\n\ndefendant \"specifically intended to cause  the kind of fire  that\r\n\nrecklessly would endanger others\"). \r\n\n          C.

See U.S.S.G.   3B1.1(c).  As we have said before, \"role\r                       \r\n\nin the offense\" determinations are fact intensive and we normally\r\n\nreview  for clear error.

Appellant argues that he and Schaller were,\r\n\nat best, \"equals\" and nothing more than \"partners in crime.\" \r\n\n          Under U.S.S.G.    3B1.1(c), a two-level enhancement  is\r\n\nwarranted if  the sentencing  court determines that  the criminal\r\n\nenterprise involved at least  two participants, and the defendant\r\n\nexercised  control  over,   or  was  otherwise   responsible  for\r\n\norganizing the  activities of, at  least one other  individual in\r\n\ncommitting the crime.  See, e.g., Morillo,  8 F.3d at 872; United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.  Akitoye,  923 F.2d  221,  227 (1st  Cir.  1991).

Finally,   the\r\n\ngovernment must bear the  burden of proving that an  upward role-\r\n\nin-the-offense adjustment is warranted. Morillo, 8 F.3d at 872.  \r                                                         \r\n\n          Here,  it is  undisputed  that  Appellant and  Schaller\r\n\nparticipated in the attempted arson of the Galleria II.  Contrary\r\n\nto  Appellant's  contention  that   he  and  Schaller  were  mere\r\n\n\"equals,\" evidence was submitted at trial that it was Appellant's\r\n\nidea to burn the Galleria II; that Appellant devised the time and\r\n\nmethod  of committing  the offense;  that Schaller  was persuaded\r\n\nand, ultimately, recruited by Appellant after Appellant failed to\r\n\nhire  someone  else   to  commit  the   offense  and  after   his\r\n\nunsuccessful  attempt  to start  a fire  in  the attic;  and that\r\n\nSchaller poured the gasoline  at Appellant's request and informed\r\n\nAppellant  when  he  was   finished.    Contrary  to  Appellant's\r\n\nargument,  these factual  findings  satisfy the  requirements for\r\n\n                               -51-\r\r\n\napplying   3B1.1(c).  We are unpersuaded by Appellant's  argument\r\n\nthat  the fact that Appellant asked or persuaded Schaller to pour\r\n\ngasoline  does not show  supervision over him.   While it may not\r\n\nshow  supervision,  it   certainly  shows  --  at  a  minimum  --\r\n\nAppellant's   exercise   of   decision   making   authority,  his\r\n\nrecruitment  of  accomplices,  and  the  greater  degree  of  his\r\n\nparticipation in planning and organizing the two  arson attempts.\r\n\nThus,   finding  no   clear   error  in   the  district   court's\r\n\ndetermination  of  Appellant's  role,32 we  affirm  the  district\r\n\ncourt's two-level enhancement.

Appellant appeals his conviction as well as his sentence on a number of grounds.   For the following reasons, we affirm the district court's judgment and sentence in all respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Presenting the facts in the light most hospitable to the jury's verdict, see United States v. Staula, 80 F.3d 596, 599 (1st Cir.1996);  United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 711 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 1063, 113 S.Ct. 1005, 122 L.Ed.2d 154 (1993), the evidence presented during the nine-day trial tended to show the following.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Galleria II was a family-style restaurant and pub serving Italian food and pizza, located in Westport, Massachusetts (the \"restaurant\"), which was owned by three partners:  Appellant, Robert Ashness (\"Ashness\") and Dr. Louis Aguiar (\"Dr. Aguiar\").   The restaurant was located in a building which Appellant and Ashness leased from Dr. Aguiar and Fernando Lopes (\"Lopes\").   The lease agreement provided, among other things, for a monthly rent of $3,600 and an option for the restaurant owners to purchase Lopes' share in the property.   The restaurant received natural gas and food supplies that moved through interstate commerce. Although very successful during the summer months of 1991, its first year of operation, the Galleria II's business proved to be seasonal and business slowed considerably after the summer.   In addition to the slow business, there were significant problems with the building's water and septic systems and the relationship between Appellant and Dr. Aguiar deteriorated over who was responsible to pay for the required improvements:  the restaurant, as tenant, or Dr. Aguiar and Lopes, as landlords.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among the Galleria II's employees, Randy Schaller (\"Schaller\") served as chef and as kitchen manager;  and Shelley McKenna (\"McKenna\") served as the bar manager and hostess and was also responsible for the cash and bookkeeping.   Both Schaller and McKenna had longstanding business relationships with Appellant and considered him a friend.   Beginning in the fall of 1991, Appellant began discussing with Schaller the need for renovating the restaurant.   In addition to correcting the water and septic systems, Appellant proposed that an outside roof-top deck be installed for the purpose of increasing liquor sales during the peak summer season.   Appellant told Schaller that he wanted to finance the renovations by burning the top of the restaurant above the second floor as the insurance proceeds from the fire would provide funds for the renovations.   As part of his plan, Appellant increased the Galleria II's existing insurance coverage (building, contents, and premises liability) by purchasing $90,000 of business interruption insurance, which became effective December 3, 1991, two months before the arson attempts.   The proceeds from the business interruption coverage could have been used for any purpose, including for the repair of the water and septic systems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about February 19, 1992, after unsuccessfully attempting to hire someone else to burn the top of the restaurant, Appellant attempted to set a fire himself by igniting a stack of papers in the attic of the restaurant.   The fire burned out, however, before it could fully ignite the exposed wood frame.   Both Schaller and McKenna, who had been drawn to the attic because of the open attic door, discovered Appellant standing over the burning stack of papers and refused to get involved.   During the days following his first failed attempt, Appellant asked Schaller if he would help by pouring gasoline on the attic rafters as part of a plan whereby Appellant would return later to ignite the gasoline.   After repeatedly declining to get involved, Schaller finally agreed to assist Appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after noon on February 23, 1992, Schaller poured gasoline, as Appellant had requested, onto the exposed attic rafters and insulation and informed Appellant that he had done so.   About mid-afternoon, Appellant and Schaller left the restaurant.   At approximately 4:00 p.m. that same afternoon, the Westport Fire Department responded to a complaint from the restaurant that there was a strong odor of gas, which both patrons and employees at the restaurant had detected.   After evacuating the building, the firefighters discovered the gasoline-soaked boards and insulation as well as evidence of charring on the attic floor and ceiling.   According to the fire department, the charring was unrelated to the much larger area of the attic that was saturated with gasoline, representing a separate, previous attempt to start a fire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A few days later, Schaller admitted to the police that he had poured the gasoline.   Although Appellant told law enforcement officials that he would fire Schaller when they informed him of Schaller's confession, Appellant never fired Schaller, and Schaller worked at the restaurant until it closed.   On December 6, 1993, Schaller entered a plea of guilty to the federal indictment charging him with the second attempted arson.   Pursuant to his plea agreement, he agreed to cooperate with law enforcement officials.   As part of that cooperation, Schaller engaged in four conversations--three in person and one by telephone--with Appellant that were recorded by law enforcement agents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In July 1994, a two count indictment was returned by the federal grand jury charging Appellant with attempted arson of a building affecting interstate commerce under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(i) and conspiracy to commit arson under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371.   Prior to trial, Appellant filed a motion in limine to exclude from evidence the four recorded conversations between Appellant and Schaller, which included incriminating statements made by Appellant.   After a hearing, the court denied the motion and admitted the tapes after certain portions were excised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During a nine-day trial on the merits, in which nine witnesses testified for the prosecution (including Schaller, pursuant to his plea agreement), the prosecution presented its theory that Appellant attempted to burn the restaurant in order to recover insurance proceeds to finance renovations and improvements of the restaurant.   The defense called three witnesses, including McKenna.   Among other matters, the witnesses testified that Schaller's reputation for truthfulness was \"zero;\"  that the business interruption insurance was purchased as a result of significant storms which had caused the Galleria II to close;  that, after leaving with Schaller during the afternoon of February 22, Appellant had no intention of returning to the restaurant;  and that Appellant was with McKenna during the evening of February 22, planning their next day's business trip.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the trial, Appellant moved for a mistrial, which was denied, on the grounds that improper testimony regarding his ownership of a \"gay night club\" was prejudicial.   Both at the close of the government's case-in-chief and at the close of all the evidence, Appellant moved for judgment of acquittal on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to establish that the Galleria II was a building affecting interstate commerce.   The district court denied both motions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the foregoing and other evidence, the jury convicted Appellant on February 10, 1995, on both counts of attempted arson and conspiracy to commit arson.   Appellant subsequently moved for a new trial which the district court denied.   On May 25, 1995, the district court sentenced Appellant to a term of seventy-eight (78) months' imprisonment, imposed a fine of $12,500, restitution to the Westport Police Department in the amount of $386, and ordered supervised release for three (3) years.   Appellant appeals both his conviction and his sentence.   We have jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 4(b) of Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>I. Appellant's Motions for Judgment of Acquittal</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant claims reversible error in the denial of his motions for judgment of acquittal.   See Fed.R.Crim.P. 29.   Below, Appellant based his motions for acquittal on sufficiency of the evidence grounds, which included the argument that there was insufficient evidence to prove the requisite nexus to interstate commerce under the federal arson statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  On appeal, he raises new arguments based on the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Lopez, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), which struck down the Gun Free School Zone Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(q), as exceeding Congress' authority under the Commerce Clause<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> to regulate interstate commerce.   Appellant now argues that, in light of Lopez, the federal arson statute is unconstitutional and that, accordingly, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.   In the alternative, Appellant argues that under Lopez there is insufficient evidence to prove that the Galleria II was a building that \"substantially affected\" interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Specifically, Appellant now claims that this is a simple state arson case which Congress has no power under the Commerce Clause to federalize and thereby undercut Massachusetts' power to prosecute Appellant under its own arson statute, Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 266, &#167; 1.   In support of this argument, Appellant insists that Lopez effectively overruled the Supreme Court's earlier decision in Russell v. United States, 471 U.S. 858, 859, 105 S.Ct. 2455, 2456, 85 L.Ed.2d 829 (1985), which concluded that the federal arson statute expresses Congressional intent to exercise its full power under the Commerce Clause.  Id. (holding that rental property was property used in an activity affecting interstate commerce within the meaning of the federal arson statute).   Consequently, Appellant challenges the \"continuing viability\" of United States v. Medeiros, 897 F.2d 13 (1st Cir.1990), in which we held that after Russell rental property is per se \"unquestionably sufficiently connected to interstate commerce to confer jurisdiction\" and satisfy the jurisdictional element of the federal arson statute.  Id. at 16-17.   Appellant, thus, urges us to reexamine our holding in Medeiros in light of Lopez ' \"substantially affect\" nexus requirement between the illegal activity and interstate commerce, and reverse his convictions on the grounds that the evidence does not prove that the attempted arson of the Galleria II \"substantially affects\" interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. The Constitutionality of Section 844(i)</p>\n    <p>1. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Appellant failed to raise his Lopez-based challenge below,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> a claim that a statute is unconstitutional or that the court lacked jurisdiction may be raised for the first time on appeal.  United States v. Seuss, 474 F.2d 385, 387 n. 2 (1st Cir.), cert. denied., 412 U.S. 928, 93 S.Ct. 2751, 37 L.Ed.2d 155 (1973);  see also, Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(2) (lack of jurisdiction may be noticed by the court at any time).   We review a determination of the constitutionality of a federal statute de novo.   See United States v. Diaz-Martinez, 71 F.3d 946, 953 (1st Cir.1995) (applying, without explicitly stating so, de novo review to Lopez-based constitutional challenge not raised during pre-Lopez proceedings);  United States v. Sherlin, 67 F.3d 1208, 1213-14 (6th Cir.1995) (applying de novo review to Lopez-based constitutional challenge to the federal arson statute), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 795, 133 L.Ed.2d 744 (1996);  United States v. Aguilar-Aranceta, 957 F.2d 18, 21 (1st Cir.1992) (reviewing de novo questions of constitutional law).   But see United States v. Spires, 79 F.3d 464, 465 (5th Cir.1996) (reviewing only for plain error Lopez-based constitutional challenge not raised below during pre-Lopez proceedings);  United States v. Dupaquier, 74 F.3d 615, 619 (5th Cir.1996) (same);  Daigle v. Maine Medical Center, Inc., 14 F.3d 684, 687-88 (1st Cir.1994) (\"The raise-or-waive rule applies with full force to constitutional challenges.\").   Regardless of what standard of review we apply, the result is the same since even under the more favorable de novo standard, we reject Appellant's constitutional and jurisdictional challenges, finding that Lopez in no way provides grounds for reversal in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As with the federal arson statute at issue here, Congress has often invoked its authority under the Commerce Clause to federalize criminal activity.   Appellant points to Lopez and its invalidation of the Gun Free School Zone Act<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> as evidence that the Supreme Court's present position is to restrictively interpret the Commerce Clause when it is used as a foundation for a criminal statute.   See Lopez, --- U.S. at ---- n. 3, 115 S.Ct. at 1631 n. 3 (\"Under our federal system, the 'States possess primary authority for defining and enforcing the federal law.' \"  (quoting Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 635, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 1720, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993))).   The Lopez Court recognized three categories of activity which Congress may regulate under the Commerce Clause:  (i) \"the use of the channels of interstate commerce\";  (ii) \"the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities\";  and (iii) \"those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.\"  Lopez, --- U.S. at ---- - ----, 115 S.Ct. at 1629-30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Lopez, the Court explained in United States v. Robertson, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1732, 131 L.Ed.2d 714 (1995) (per curiam), that these three bases of congressional authority are analytically distinct, reaffirming the distinction between activities engaged in interstate commerce and purely intrastate activities having a substantial effect on interstate commerce.   See Robertson, --- U.S. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 1733.   The Court stated that the \" 'affecting commerce' test was developed in our jurisprudence to define the extent of Congress' power over purely intra state commercial activities that nonetheless have substantial inter state effects.\"  Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 1733 (emphasis in original) (concluding that transporting equipment and workers from out of state fell within 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(a)'s alternative criterion without regard to the \"affecting commerce\" test).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We consider the federal arson statute and the Court's pre-Lopez holding in Russell in light of this framework, concluding that Lopez does not invalidate 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(i).   First, by its plain language, Section 844(i) clearly falls under both the second and third Lopez categories in that it protects property that is either \"used in interstate or foreign commerce or in any activity affecting interstate or foreign commerce.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(i) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the federal arson statute contains the requisite \"jurisdictional element\" and thus is readily distinguishable from the provision invalidated in Lopez.   As we recently noted in Diaz-Martinez, the Supreme Court in Lopez \"found significant that the statute in that case, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(q) [the federal firearms possession statute], 'contain[ed] no jurisdictional element which would ensure, through case-by-case inquiry, that the firearm possession in question affects interstate commerce.' \"  Diaz- Martinez, 71 F.3d at 953 (quoting Lopez, --- U.S. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 1631).   We held that, unlike Lopez, the jurisdictional element was present in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(k) because it contains a specific requirement that the firearm with the obliterated serial number have been \"shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(k);  Diaz-Martinez, 71 F.3d at 953 (holding that \"[w]hatever the reach of Lopez, it does not invalidate 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(k)\").   Here, too, the federal arson statute contains the requisite jurisdictional element which similarly ensures that, case-by-case, the property damaged by the arson must have been \"used in interstate ... commerce or in an activity affecting interstate ... commerce.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(i).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, while the federal arson statute is similar to that struck down in Lopez in that it does not regulate commercial or economic activity, see United States v. Pappadopoulos, 64 F.3d 522, 526-27 (9th Cir.1995), it does regulate the damage or destruction of business property that satisfies the requisite interstate nexus, see Russell, 471 U.S. at 860-62, 105 S.Ct. at 2457 (\"Congress at least intended to protect all business property\");  United States v. Flaherty, 76 F.3d 967, 974 (8th Cir.1996).   Particularly in the absence of any mention of Russell in the majority opinion of Lopez, we can find no reason to conclude that Lopez invalidates Russell 's analysis of Section 844(i)'s purpose and legislative history or its conclusion that the federal arson statute constitutionally regulates arson of business property that satisfies the requisite jurisdictional element.  Russell, 471 U.S. at 860-62, 105 S.Ct. at 2456-58.   After all, whatever Lopez ' reach, it certainly did not purport to overrule cases upholding application of the Commerce Clause power to wholly intrastate activities satisfying the requisite nexus to interstate commerce.   See United States v. Genao, 79 F.3d 1333, 1336 (2d Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, we reject Appellant's argument that Section 844(i) is unconstitutional because it improperly intrudes into Massachusetts' primary authority for defining and enforcing the criminal law.   By virtue of the fact that the federal arson statute is a criminal law it indeed intrudes upon states' traditional dominion over the criminal law.  Lopez, --- U.S. at ---- n. 3, 115 S.Ct. at 1631 n. 3 (\"Under our federal system, the 'States possess primary authority for defining and enforcing the criminal law.' \"  (quoting Abrahamson, 507 U.S. at 635, 113 S.Ct. at 1720)).   However, \"not every federal foray into criminal law is invalid.\"  United States v. Bishop, 66 F.3d 569, 584 (3d Cir.1995) (rejecting Lopez-based challenge to the constitutionality of the federal carjacking statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2119).   Where, as here, the criminal statute satisfies the constitutional limits of the Commerce Clause, it withstands the challenge that it interferes with the states' ability to define and enforce the criminal law.   See Russell, 471 U.S. at 860-62, 105 S.Ct. at 2456-58.   Finally, we note that we join our fellow circuits in arriving at the conclusion that 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(i) passes constitutional muster under Lopez.   See, e.g., Flaherty, 76 F.3d at 974;  United States v. Denalli, 73 F.3d 328, 329 (11th Cir.1996);  Sherlin, 67 F.3d at 1213-14;  Pappadopoulos, 64 F.3d at 526.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we find no basis to question the presumed validity of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(i), we conclude that the district court properly had subject-matter jurisdiction conferred by virtue of the fact that Appellant was charged with an \"offense against the United States.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3231.   See United States v. Ryan, 41 F.3d 361, 363-64 (8th Cir.1994) (noting that \"if [the jurisdictional] element is not satisfied, then [defendant] is not guilty;  but the court is not by the failure of proof on that element deprived of judicial jurisdiction.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to Appellant's claim that there was insufficient evidence to sustain his convictions, Appellant \"faces an uphill climb,\" United States v. Valle, 72 F.3d 210, 216 (1st Cir.1995).  \"If the evidence presented, taken in the light most agreeable to the government, is adequate to permit a rational jury to find each essential element of the offense of conviction beyond a reasonable doubt, then [Appellant's] claim fails.\"  Id. (citations omitted).   As the district court's disposition of a motion for judgment of acquittal is subject to de novo review, we, \"like the trial court, must 'scrutinize the evidence in the light most compatible with the verdict, resolve all credibility disputes in the verdict's favor, and then reach a judgment whether a rational jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.' \"  Id. (quoting United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 974 (1st Cir.1995)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After thoroughly reviewing the record<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and applying these straightforward rules, we are convinced that a rational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the government had successfully proved each of the elements--including, as we discuss more thoroughly below, the requisite nexus to interstate commerce--of both Appellant's attempt and conspiracy convictions.   Credibility determinations are uniquely within the jury's province;  and, we defer to their determinations and the verdict if the evidence can support varying inferences.   See, e.g., United States v. Cruz-Kuilan, 75 F.3d 59, 62 (1st Cir.1996);  United States v. Gonzalez-Torres, 980 F.2d 788, 790 (1st Cir.1992).   Here, the record clearly supports the verdict.   That the jury chose to believe the testimony presented by the government, particularly that of Schaller, and disbelieve that presented by the defense was well within its province.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As part of our sufficiency of the evidence review, we must determine whether the requisite jurisdictional element is met.   Because it constitutes a jurisdictional predicate of the substantive offense, this \"jurisdictional element,\" like other elements of the offense, must be proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.   See Pappadopoulos, 64 F.3d at 524;  Medeiros, 897 F.2d at 15-17 (stating that the government need only show a de minimis connection to interstate commerce in order to satisfy this element).   Thus, in order for Appellant to be found guilty under the federal arson statute, the government had to prove, among other things, that the property was either \"used in\" or \"used in an activity affecting\" interstate commerce.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(i).   This involves identifying for what activity or purpose the building is \"used.\"   Cf. Medeiros, 897 F.2d at 16 (focusing on the character of a fictitious building in determining whether it was sufficiently connected to interstate commerce).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Appellant argues that there is insufficient evidence to prove that the Galleria II was a building used in or affecting interstate commerce, because under Lopez the evidence does not prove that the building \"substantially affects\" interstate commerce.   Because Appellant did not raise this Lopez argument below, we review only for plain error the district court's ruling on the sufficiency of the evidence regarding the jurisdictional element.  United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1777, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (\"There must be an 'error' that is 'plain' and that 'affect[s] substantial rights.' \");  United States v.

At the time of the district court's decision, Lopez had not yet been decided and there was no reason for the district court to question the viability of Russell or Medeiros.   Under Medeiros, the government need only show, and the jury need only find, a de minimis connection to interstate commerce in order to sustain a conviction under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(i).  Medeiros, 897 F.2d at 16-17.   Here, the government presented uncontested evidence that the object of the attempted arsons was a \"building\" that was being \"used\" as a commercial establishment, the Galleria II restaurant.   The jury was presented with evidence that Appellant and his partners rented the building;  that the building was supplied with natural gas which traveled in interstate commerce;  and that the restaurant received food supplies for its operation which traveled in interstate commerce.   Indeed, Appellant conceded at oral argument that the building was used as a commercial establishment which received food supplies and natural gas for its operation that travelled in interstate commerce.   The district court correctly instructed the jury that the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Galleria II was property \"used in or [sic] affected interstate or foreign commerce.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury verdict, this evidence more than satisfies Medeiros ' de minimis requirement, and we therefore reject Appellant's insufficiency of the evidence argument.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  See, e.g., Ryan, 41 F.3d at 364 (the de minimis standard \"is easily met, even when the property is temporarily closed or vacant\");  U.S. v. Menzer, 29 F.3d 1223, 1229 (7th Cir.)

Above, we found no reason to think that Lopez in any way undercut Russell 's conclusion that Congress has the authority to regulate arson of business property.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Similarly, we find no basis to conclude that Lopez in any way undercuts Russell 's holding that \"rental property is unquestionably\" an \"activity\" that affects interstate commerce within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(i).  Russell, 471 U.S. at 862, 105 S.Ct. at 2457 (\"We need not rely on the connection between the market for residential units and the 'interstate movement of people,' to recognize that the local rental of an apartment unit is merely an element of a much broader commercial market in rental properties.\"  (quoting McLain v. Real Estate Board of New Orleans, 444 U.S. 232, 245, 100 S.Ct. 502, 510-11, 62 L.Ed.2d 441 (1980)));  cf. Sherlin, 67 F.3d at 1213 (finding that building used in educational business of college was building used in an activity affecting interstate commerce).   We, thus, reaffirm our holding in Medeiros that rental property is per se sufficiently connected to interstate commerce to confer federal jurisdiction under Section 844(i) and to satisfy the jurisdictional element.   See Medeiros, 897 F.2d at 16.   Because uncontested evidence was presented that, at the time of the attempted fires, Appellant and his partner rented the building in which the Galleria II was operated, the jury was presented with sufficient evidence to find that the building was \"used in an activity affecting\" interstate commerce within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(i)'s second category.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming further that Lopez undermines Russell and Medeiros ' holding regarding rental property, we would nonetheless affirm the jury's finding.   Because uncontested evidence was presented below that the building was used as a commercial establishment which received food supplies and natural gas for its operation that travelled in interstate commerce, the Galleria II also falls within 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(i)'s \"real or personal property used in interstate ... commerce.\"   Because the Galleria II was property used in interstate commerce, we need not address whether its activities \"substantially affect[ed]\" interstate commerce.

At this point, Appellant objected to the comment and moved for a mistrial on the grounds that the \"comment was completely gratuitous ...

The court decided to speak with the jurors individually to ascertain (i) whether the juror was affected by the testimony in any way;  (ii) whether the juror would remain impartial;  and (iii) whether the juror would be able to render a verdict based on the evidence and the law as instructed by the court, without regard to the fact that Appellant operated a gay night club.   After every juror responded that he or she would not be affected by the testimony in rendering his or her verdict, (Transcript, Vol. 4 at 101-12), the court concluded, \"All right.   I'm satisfied.\"  (Transcript, Vol. 4 at 113).   At this point, and without further comment by counsel, testimony resumed.   At the end of trial, Appellant did not request any additional questions be asked of the jurors or that any additional instructions be given.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the record, and under the guiding principle that a district court may declare a mistrial only as a \"last resort,\" Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1184, we find that the district court's decision \"was well within the broad range of its discretion.\"  Rivera-Gomez, 67 F.3d at 999.   The district court properly weighed the claim of impropriety and determined that it was unfounded based on his voir dire of the jurors.  United States v. Hahn, 17 F.3d 502, 508 (1st Cir.1994) (\"A mistrial need not be allowed absent a clear showing of prejudice.\").   Moreover, the district court acted swiftly by polling the jurors immediately after the improper testimony.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1185 (\"Swiftness in judicial response is an important element in alleviating prejudice once the jury has been exposed to improper testimony.\").   The government argues that this polling effectively provided a curative instruction that the jurors were not to consider evidence that Appellant operated a gay night club in determining guilt or innocence.   Given the questions asked and the responses received, we agree that the district court \"efficaciously dispelled\" any prejudicial effect of Schaller's statement by its immediate and thorough response.   See United States v. Bello-Perez, 977 F.2d 664, 672 (1st Cir.1992) (affirming denial of motion for mistrial where \"[a]ny prejudicial effect of the remark was efficaciously dispelled\").   Finally, given the overwhelming evidence of guilt presented during the trial, the challenged testimony was innocuous.

Appellant's Motion for a New Trial and Motion in Limine</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, Appellant appeals the denial of his motion for a new trial, arguing that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion in limine<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> to exclude from evidence four tapes of recorded conversations between himself and Schaller in February, March and May 1994.   As the motion for a new trial is not properly before us on appeal,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> we only address Appellant's motion in limine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  Appellant argued below, as he does now, that the tapes should have been excluded in their entirety from evidence because (i) their probative value was substantially outweighed by their prejudicial effect under Fed.R.Evid. 403, even after certain portions were redacted;  (ii) they were improperly admitted as evidence of \"other crimes, wrongs, or acts\" under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b);  and (iii) portions of them were partially or wholly unintelligible which thereby rendered them more misleading than helpful.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the court listened to the four tapes, reviewed their respective transcripts, and heard arguments of counsel on the admissibility of both the tapes and the transcripts.   In denying Appellant's motion in limine to exclude the tapes in their entirety under Fed.R.Evid. 403 and 404(b), the district court found that they were admissible as probative of the issues raised in the case and that they were \"overall more relevant\" than prejudicial.  (Transcript, Vol. 2 at 12-13).   The district court, however, did allow Appellant to make specific objections of undue prejudice.  (Transcript, Vol. 2 at 13-15).   After hearing argument from counsel, (Transcript, Vol. 4 at 4-47), the district court agreed with most of Appellant's specific objections and excluded those portions.   With respect to Appellant's audibility argument, the district court only found the March 1, 1994, tape troubling in that it \"seems ... just woefully inadequate for any reasonable person to understand.\"  (Transcript, Vol. 2-17).   The district court's concern was that the only way to understand the tape was to read the transcript which resulted in the transcript--and the Government's view--being given too much weight.   After considering alternatives and hearing arguments from counsel, the district court decided to admit the tape and allow the transcript because both parties had stipulated to the accuracy of the transcript as a true rendition of the recording.  (Transcript, Vol. 2 at 4;  Vol. 4 at 4).   Finally, the district court gave cautionary instructions to the jury that the tapes were evidence but that the transcripts were not.   The district court also ruled that the transcripts would not be permitted during deliberations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  (Transcript, Vol. 4 at 4-5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn to Appellant's arguments, reviewing the district court's decision to admit or exclude evidence under Fed.R.Evid. 403 and 404(b) for abuse of discretion.   See, e.g., United States v. Frankhauser, 80 F.3d 641, 648 (1st Cir.1996);  United States v. Cruz-Kuilan, 75 F.3d 59, 61 (1st Cir.1996).   The same standard of review applies regarding the district court's decision to admit the tapes over Appellant's audibility argument.   See United States v. Jadusingh, 12 F.3d 1162, 1167 (1st Cir.1994) (\"As we have held on numerous occasions, a trial judge's ruling on the admission of recordings is afforded 'broad discretion,' even where portions of the taped conversation are unintelligible.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. The Tapes' Relevancy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence is excludable under Fed.R.Evid. 403 \"if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  After reviewing the transcript,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> we find no abuse of discretion in the district court's decision to not exclude the tapes in their entirety.   In support of his argument, Appellant claims that (i) none of Appellant's statements prove any element of the alleged crimes or show consciousness of guilt;  (ii) the recorded conversations took place two years after the predicate offenses occurred;  (iii) many of Appellant's arguments were made in response to questions instigated by the government witness;  and, (iv) any relevant conversations were intertwined with others that were not relevant.   We find none of these arguments persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court found, the tapes included highly probative evidence regarding Appellant's consciousness of guilt, including admissions.   The tapes were directly relevant to the government's theory regarding both Appellant's involvement in the attempted arson and the conspiracy.   Indeed, we note that Appellant's counsel conceded as much during the hearing on the tapes' admissibility:  \"I concede, Judge, that there were parts that, given the Government's position and its interpretation, are relevant.\"  (Transcript, Vol. 2 at 12).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, the February 24, 1994, tape includes a conversation regarding the payment of Schaller's legal fees.   Not only did it corroborate Schaller's testimony that Appellant assisted in the payment of Schaller's legal fees, this conversation included evidence from which the jury could draw an inference \"that this money is being paid because these gentlemen were in on the deal together.\"  (Transcript, Vol. 4 at 9).   The March 1, 1994, tape includes an admission by Appellant that he threw matches to light the fire during the first attempt:  \"You weren't there when I threw the [expletive] matches the first time.\"   The March 4, 1994, tape includes an adoptive admission by Appellant regarding his attempts to burn the restaurant during a conversation about whether Appellant had told anyone about those efforts.   While Appellant denies telling anybody else about his efforts, he responds to Schaller's questions directly without ever disputing the veracity of what Schaller's questions imply--that Appellant \"tried to burn it.\"   The May 25, 1994, tape provides evidence of the conspiracy between Schaller and Appellant.   The conversation demonstrates that, although they were confused as to their recollection of what they believed to be their respective roles, they clearly had conspired to burn the restaurant.   This sampling of each of the four tapes clearly shows that, contrary to Appellant's claims, the recordings include statements by Appellant that are directly probative of both attempts and the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant also points to the fact that the recorded conversations occurred two years after the alleged offenses, arguing that the recordings are neither closely intertwined with the charged offenses nor helpful in establishing Appellant's intent to commit the crimes charged.   Appellant cites to three cases addressing the admissibility of evidence under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b).   See United States v. Huff, 959 F.2d 731, 736 (8th Cir.1992);  United States v. Brookins, 919 F.2d 281, 286 (5th Cir.1990);  United States v. Hodges, 770 F.2d 1475, 1480 n. 4 (9th Cir.1985).   We agree with these cases that proximity in time is a factor to be considered in determining relevancy under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) of \"other crimes, wrongs, or acts.\"   See, e.g., United States v. Fields, 871 F.2d 188, 197 (1st Cir.1989) (\"Probative value must be considered in light of the remoteness in time of the other act and the degree of the resemblance to the crime charged.\");  United States v. Currier, 836 F.2d 11, 17 (1st Cir.1987) (noting that the prior bad acts were both close in time and in nature to the crime charged).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  In addition, Appellant also points out that the tapes here are distinguishable from those admitted in Currier, based on the fact that the recorded conversations in that case occurred immediately prior to and after the crime charged and were, thus, found to \"help[ ] establish appellant's intent to commit the crime charged.\"  Id.  Because the conversations here occurred two years after the predicate offenses, Appellant contends that the tapes cannot be said to be so \"closely intertwined\" with the predicate offenses so as to help establish Appellant's intent to commit the crimes charged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are unswayed by Appellant's arguments.   Here, as we discuss below, no evidence of prior bad acts was admitted in this case;  and, because Appellant has not cited to any cases holding that proximity in time is a prerequisite for determining relevance under Fed.R.Evid. 403, and because we have not found any, we are unconvinced that the timing of the conversations is of any consequence or otherwise undermines their strong relevance.   See, e.g., United States v. Perkins, 926 F.2d 1271, 1279-80 (1st Cir.1991) (finding no error in admission of post-conspiracy statements made to a government informant where court found statements were an admission corroborating trial testimony and reflected complicity and consciousness of guilt).   Even assuming, arguendo, that proximity must be considered in determining relevance, we nonetheless find that even though the conversations occur two years after the attempt and conspiracy, they are \"closely intertwined with the charged offense[s] ... [and] [ ] provid[e] ... significant contextual material\" for the jury.  Currier, 836 F.2d at 17 (citations omitted).   As discussed above, while they do not necessarily show Appellant's intent to commit the attempted arson or to enter into a conspiracy, they do show Appellant's consciousness of guilt and complicity as well as the existence of a conspiracy.   See Perkins, 926 F.2d at 1279-80.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While not all evidence with probative value is admissible, we do not find that its value is \"substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\"   Fed.R.Evid. 403.   In reviewing the balancing undertaken by the district court, we give great deference to the district court's judgment, and \"[o]nly in exceptional circumstances will we reverse the exercise of a district court's informed discretion vis-a-vis the relative weighing of probative value and unfairly prejudicial effect.\"  Currier, 836 F.2d at 18 (quoting United States v. Griffin, 818 F.2d 97, 101-02 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 844, 108 S.Ct. 137, 98 L.Ed.2d 94 (1987)).   Based on our review of the record, we do not find that the probative value of the tapes--as edited<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a>--was outweighed by unfairly prejudicial evidence.   See, e.g., United States v. Munoz, 36 F.3d 1229, 1233 (1st Cir.1994) (noting that the question under Rule 403 is one of unfair prejudice, not prejudice alone);  Currier, 836 F.2d at 18 (\"Unfairly prejudicial evidence is evidence ... that 'triggers [the] mainsprings of human action [in such a way as to] cause the jury to base its decision on something other than the established proposition in the case.' \")  (quoting 1 Weinstein's Evidence &#167; 403, 36-39 (1986)).   Neither the fact that many of Appellant's remarks were made in response to questions or comments by the government witness, nor that relevant conversations were intertwined with non-relevant ones, persuades us to reach a different conclusion.   Even the fact that the recordings reveal that Appellant had initially wanted to hire \"a guy from organized crime so to speak\" to burn the restaurant, (Transcript, Vol. 4 at 32), or that Appellant tells Schaller what to say about pouring the gasoline, (Transcript, Vol. 4 at 44), does not make them unfairly prejudicial.   Finally, we do not find that any \"exceptional circumstances\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> exist which warrant reversal of the district court's rulings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Tapes' Prior Bad Act Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find Appellant's reliance on Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) to be irrelevant on appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a>  While the transcript of the pre-trial hearing regarding the admissibility of the tapes shows that there were references to previous fires which arguably fall within Fed.R.Evid. 404(b), the record shows that these references were excised by agreement of the parties.  (Transcript, Vol. 4 at 21).   Not only does Appellant not specify on appeal what \"other crimes, wrongs, or acts\" under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) were erroneously admitted into evidence, we find no mention of any in the portions that were admitted into evidence.   Accordingly, we do not address this argument further.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. The Tapes' Audibility</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, as to Appellant's audibility argument, in exercising its broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility of tape recordings, even where portions are unintelligible, Font-Ramirez, 944 F.2d at 47, the district court \"must decide whether 'the inaudible parts are so substantial as to make the rest more misleading than helpful.' \"  Id. (citations omitted) (quoting Gorin v. United States, 313 F.2d 641, 652 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 374 U.S. 829, 83 S.Ct. 1870, 10 L.Ed.2d 1052 (1963)).   While the district court found that there were segments of poor audio and static, the district court nonetheless decided to admit them.   The district court was swayed by the fact that the parties stipulated to the accuracy of the transcript as a true recording of the tapes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>  We are similarly swayed and find no abuse of the court's broad discretion, even as to the March 1, 1994, tape about which the district court was most concerned.   Based on our review of the transcript,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a> we disagree with Appellant's claim that the inaudible parts, when taken as a whole, were so substantial as to make the rest more misleading than helpful, because the transcript clearly evidences that sufficient portions of the tapes, including statements by both Schaller and Appellant, are audible.   As discussed earlier, these segments are relevant because they include, inter alia, admissions by Appellant, tending to show consciousness of guilt and corroborate trial testimony.   Furthermore, the district court gave a cautionary instruction to the jury that not only informed them that the tapes, but not the transcript, were evidence, but also that the jurors had to draw their own conclusions regarding their content and probative value based on what they themselves heard on the tapes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a>  United States v. Carbone, 798 F.2d 21, 26 (1st Cir.1986) (finding that the judge's handling of the transcript was in accord with the law where the record shows that the judge carefully instructed the jurors that the tapes, not the transcripts, were evidence and that any differences between the two must be resolved in favor of what was heard on the recording).   Based on the record, and particularly in light of Appellant's stipulation to the accuracy of the transcript as a true recording of the tapes, we find no abuse of discretion by the district court in admitting the tapes over Appellant's audibility objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Appellant's Sentence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Appellant appeals his sentence imposed by the district court pursuant to the federal arson guidelines.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a>  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K1.4(a)(1)-(4).

New language in the Commentary, Application Note 2, provides that \"[c]reating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury includes creating that risk to firefighters and other emergency and law enforcement personnel who respond to or investigate an offense.\"   See, e.g., United States v. Turner, 995 F.2d 1357, 1365 (6th Cir.1993) (finding that endangering firefighters is an appropriate factor);  United States v. Grimes, 967 F.2d 1468, 1471 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 927, 113 S.Ct. 355, 121 L.Ed.2d 269 (1992) (noting that several other circuits had come to the same conclusion).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant challenges the district court's sentence on three separate grounds.   We address them in turn, reviewing findings of fact for clear error, mindful that they need only be supported by a preponderance of the evidence, and reviewing questions of law de novo, including the scope and applicability of a relevant guideline.   See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(e);  United States v. Martinez- Martinez, 69 F.3d 1215, 1224 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v. Thompson, 32 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. The \"Fraud or Deceit\" Base Offense Level</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Appellant contends that the district court should have applied U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K1.4(a)(3), which requires computation of the base offense level as 2 plus the base offense level for \"Fraud and Deceit.\"   Appellant argues that the overwhelming evidence at trial established that his primary purpose was to defraud the insurance company and that Appellant, while creating some risk of death or serious bodily injury by pouring gasoline, did not knowingly create a substantial risk.   While the record does indicate that Appellant participated in a scheme to defraud the insurance company, we conclude that the district court properly chose subparagraph &#167; 2K1.4(a)(1) based on its specific finding--which, as we discuss below, was not clearly erroneous--that Appellant knowingly created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to persons other than the participants in the attempted arson.   See Grimes, 967 F.2d at 1472 (holding that district court properly rejected application of fraud guideline, &#167; 2K1.4(a)(3), and properly applied &#167; 2K1.4(a)(2) in case involving defendant's effort to obtain insurance through arson where defendant created substantial risk of injury or death).   The arson guideline instructs that the base offense level is determined by selecting the highest level from among four choices.   Section 2K1.4(a)(1)-(4);  United States v. Mizrachi, 48 F.3d 651, 655 (2d Cir.1995).   The Government contends that applying &#167; 2K1.4(a)(3) would only yield a base offense level of 19, less than that under &#167; 2K1.4(a)(1), which is 24.   Appellant does not dispute this calculation or otherwise present his own &#167; 2K1.4(a)(3) calculation, nor was there any discussion of this issue during the sentencing hearing.   Assuming, without deciding, that calculation under &#167; 2K1.4(a)(3) would have yielded only a base offense level of 19, we conclude that the district court correctly applied &#167; 2K1.4(a)(1) because it yielded the highest base offense level based on its finding that Appellant knowingly created a substantial risk of bodily injury.   Cf. Mizrachi, 48 F.3d at 656 (affirming district court's application of &#167; 2K1.4(a)(3) in sentencing defendant for arson, mail fraud, and money laundering offenses where facts yielded an initial base offense level of 35).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Knowing Creation of a Substantial Risk</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Appellant argues that the district court's finding that Appellant knowingly created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to any person other than a participant in the offense is not supported by a preponderance of the evidence.   Whether a defendant knowingly created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury within the meaning of section 2K1.4 of the Guidelines raises an issue of first impression in that this court has not previously determined what level of knowledge is required under &#167; 2K1.4(a)(1)(A).   At the outset, we note that this determination involves a two-step inquiry.   A court must first ask whether the defendant's actions created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury and then decide whether the defendant acted knowingly in creating that risk.   See United States v. Karlic, 997 F.2d 564, 568-69 (9th Cir.1993) (stating that the first inquiry is objective and the second is subjective).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p>1. The Substantial Risk ...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leaving aside the question of knowledge for the moment, we conclude first that the district court did not clearly err in finding that Appellant created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to any person other than a participant in the offense.   The district court based its finding primarily on the PSR, which indicated, inter alia, that the presence of gasoline created the potential for a fire or explosion.   According to the PSR, a fuel air explosion could have occurred had \"a heat source been introduced within a specific danger range between the place where the gasoline was poured and anyplace within the building where the odor of gasoline was detected,\" (PSR, at 22), and that \"because the gasoline was poured in a confined area which contained electrical outlets, an electrical spark or other heat source could have ignited the vapors in the confined area at any time,\" (PSR, at 23).   Although the evidence indicates that Appellant only planned to ignite the fire after the restaurant closed, the district court concluded that the potential for a fuel air explosion or for a fire to start accidentally created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to the occupants of the building at the time of the pouring of the gasoline in the attic as well as to firefighters and others who would respond to the incident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no clear error in this finding of substantial risk to patrons and firefighters.   It was properly based on both the PSR and the sentencing judge's common sense understanding--which Appellant conceded during the sentencing hearing was appropriate--of the risks associated with pouring an accelerant to start a fire in an occupied building where there was the potential for a fuel air explosion to occur or for a fire to start accidentally. See Medeiros, 897 F.2d at 20 (relying on common sense in finding under earlier arson guidelines that defendant conspired \"to cause the kind of fire that recklessly would endanger others.\").   As the district court correctly noted in response to Appellant's insistence that there was no risk created because no fire actually occurred, (Sentencing Transcript, pages 19-22), the Guidelines speak of \"risk.\"  \"The fact that fortuitously no one was injured and extensive damage did not result [because no fire or explosion actually occurred] does not further [A]ppellant's contention that he did not ... create a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury.\"  United States v. Honeycutt, 8 F.3d 785, 787 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, in light of the federal arson guidelines' commentary, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K1.4, Application Note 2, we find no clear error in the district court's finding of substantial risk given its finding that firefighters \"could have been blown to smithereens\" had a spark ignited the gasoline vapors (Sentencing Transcript, at 20).   See, e.g., Turner, 995 F.2d at 1365;  Grimes, 967 F.2d at 1471.   While \"all fires present some danger to firefighters required to extinguish it, ... [w]here a spectacular fire is planned near an occupied building, a finding of reckless endangerment to firefighters would be based on a common sense understanding of the risks of putting out a major fire when rescue attempts are likely to be necessary.\"  Medeiros, 897 F.2d at 20.   Similarly, here, although there is no evidence that Appellant planned a \"spectacular fire,\" the sentencing judge's finding of substantial risk in this case was based on his--and, again, our--common sense understanding of the risks associated with using an accelerant in an occupied building to start a fire where there was the potential for a fuel air explosion to occur or for a fire to start accidentally.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. ... Knowingly Created</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, we must decide whether the district court clearly erred when it found that Appellant knowingly created this substantial risk.   While we review the court's factual finding for clear error, the definition of a Guidelines term is a question of law which we review de novo.  Martinez-Martinez, 69 F.3d at 1224.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Looking first to the statute, we note that the two highest base offense levels in the federal arson guidelines, &#167; 2K1.4(a)(1) and &#167; 2K1.4(a)(2), contain almost identical language.   The latter, for which there is a base offense level of 20, applies to the creation of a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury.   The former, for which there is a base offense level of 24, applies to the knowing creation of such a risk.   This structure clearly suggests that there must be a meaningful distinction between the two sections.   See Honeycutt, 8 F.3d at 787 (noting that \"[c]learly it was intended for there to be a distinction between the two sections\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a>  Given the structure of the arson guidelines, we conclude that &#167; 2K1.4(a)(1)(A) requires that the district court make a specific finding that the defendant \"knowingly\" created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury, as opposed to merely finding that defendant recklessly (or negligently) created such a risk which would more appropriately trigger application of &#167; 2K1.4(a)(1)(B).   Apart from this rather straightforward observation, no guidance is gleaned from the Sentencing Guidelines, as \"knowingly\" is not defined.   In addition, the usual rule of giving an undefined statutory term its plain meaning provides little direction given that \" '[k]nowledge' means different things in different contexts.\"  United States v. Spinney, 65 F.3d 231, 236 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our own precedent is of little help because, while this court has addressed the application of the federal arson guidelines, see Medeiros, 897 F.2d at 18 (applying former U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K1.4(b)(2) and affirming district court's finding that defendant \"recklessly endangered the safety of another\");  see also, United States v. Flowers, 995 F.2d 315, 316 (1st Cir.1993) (involving but not discussing application of &#167; 2K1.4);  United States v. Johnson, 952 F.2d 565, 585 (1st Cir.1991) (same), it has never addressed what level of knowledge is required under the highest offense level where the substantial risk was created knowingly by the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to our fellow circuits, we note that the Ninth Circuit, and later the Eleventh Circuit, adopted the definition of \"knowingly\" as used in the Model Penal Code (the \"MPC\") when applying &#167; 2K1.4.   See Honeycutt, 8 F.3d at 787;  United States v. Karlic, 997 F.2d 564, 569 (9th Cir.1993).   Drawing from the MPC's definition,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a> the Ninth Circuit held that \"a defendant can be found to have 'knowingly' created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury under &#167; 2K1.4 only if the defendant was aware that a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury was 'practically certain' to result from the criminal act.\"  Karlic, 997 F.2d at 569;  accord, Honeycutt, 8 F.3d at 787.   We note that other courts have neither explicitly defined \"knowingly\" nor adopted the MPC's definition, apparently finding it unnecessary where the district court could clearly conclude from the facts whether the defendant knew his actions created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury.   For example, in United States v. Markum, 4 F.3d 891 (10th Cir.1993), the court found that a fire set with gasoline during business hours which put firefighters in severe jeopardy because of the ferocity of the fire and the risk of explosion constituted \"circumstances [which] more than justified the district court's finding that [defendant], as a co-conspirator, knowingly created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury.\"  Id. at 896-97.   Similarly, in United States v. Turner, 995 F.2d 1357 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 904, 114 S.Ct. 282, 126 L.Ed.2d 232 (1993), the district court concluded that defendant's actions could fit under either &#167; 2K1.4(a)(1)(A) or (B).   As to the defendant's knowledge, the court found that defendant knowingly created the substantial risk given that people in the residence adjacent to the burning building were likely to be asleep and windy conditions would cause the fire to spread quickly.  Id. at 1365.   The court in Turner also found that defendant \"should have known\" that he was placing firefighters at a substantial risk by committing the arson in weather conditions that would make extinguishing the fire extremely difficult.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As this relevant case law provides at least two distinct approaches, we find it helpful when considering the question of \"knowledge\" to recall that \"the length of the hypothetical knowledge continuum\" is marked by \"constructive knowledge\" at one end and \"actual knowledge\" at the other with various \"gradations,\" such as \"notice of likelihood\" in the \"poorly charted area that stretches between the poles.\"  Spinney, 65 F.3d at 236-37 (discussing the continuum in the context of the \"shared knowledge\" requirement in prosecution of aiding and abetting armed robbery).   In terms of this continuum, \"practical certainty\" would seem most akin to \"actual knowledge.\"  Id. (noting that \"[a]ctual knowledge, after all, is certain knowledge\").   We are inclined to conclude that a showing of knowledge anywhere along this continuum satisfies application of &#167; 2K1.4(a)(1)(A).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a>  This approach would be consistent both with the guidelines' mandate that a meaningful distinction be made between the two highest base offense levels as well as with the \"common sense\" approach we endorsed in Medeiros.   See Medeiros, 897 F.2d at 20.   That said, however, at this juncture we need not definitively resolve what level of knowledge, in addition to \"actual knowledge,\" is required.   Even assuming without deciding that, for &#167; 2K1.4(a)(1)(A) to apply, Appellant had to be \"aware that a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury was 'practically certain' to result from the criminal act,\" Karlic, 997 F.2d at 569, we reject Appellant's contention that the district court's findings are clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Appellant argues that the district court clearly erred in finding that he knowingly created the substantial risk, because \"[it] made no finding that a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury was 'practically certain' to result from his [attempted arson].\"  Appellant contends that the district court's findings that the restaurant was occupied at the time the gasoline was poured and that the vapors could have been accidentally ignited is insufficient for the application of &#167; 2K1.4(a)(1)(A), because the record does not show by a preponderance of the evidence that Appellant was \"practically certain\" that an accidental cause could have started the fire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Giving due deference to the court's application of the guidelines to the facts, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that Appellant \"knew that ... there was a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury\" (Sentencing Transcript at 23).   In arriving at our conclusion, we note that facts contained in a presentence report ordinarily are considered reliable evidence for sentencing purposes.   See United States v. Morillo, 8 F.3d 864, 872 (1st Cir.1993).   Indeed, district courts possess \"broad discretion to determine what data is, or is not, sufficiently dependable to be used in imposing sentence.\"  United States v. Tardiff, 969 F.2d 1283, 1287 (1st Cir.1992).   This is particularly true where, as here, Appellant offered no evidence to suggest an inaccuracy in the presentence report's facts.  Id., 8 F.3d at 873 (collecting cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record shows that, at the time of the first attempt,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a> Appellant knew that at least two other employees, including Schaller (who at that time was not a participant in the offense), were in the restaurant.   As the court in Honeycutt noted, \"[i]t is difficult to imagine a clearer illustration of the knowing creation of a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury.\"  Honeycutt, 8 F.3d at 787 (affirming application of &#167; 2K1.4(a)(1)(A) where defendant threw a Molotov cocktail at a structure that he admitted he knew was occupied).   In terms of our continuum, this strikes us as constituting \"actual knowledge\" and/or \"practical certainty.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the second attempt, the record shows that gasoline was poured, hours before the intended ignition, in a confined area atop the Galleria II at a time when both patrons and employees were inside.   Appellant knew gasoline was a highly flammable liquid and he arranged for it to be poured for the specific intent of lighting a fire after business hours.   In response to Appellant's \"practical certainty\" argument, the district court found that \"the fact that [Appellant] ... wanted to [ignite] the fire outside of business hours, suggests ... that he knew of the risk\" to people inside the building and to those who would respond to the fire.  (Sentencing Transcript at 18).   Contrary to Appellant's contentions, these findings are sufficient for the application of the highest base offense level.   While Appellant may not have been aware that it was \"practically certain\" that a fire could ignite accidentally or that the restaurant and any occupants could be blown to \"smithereens,\" (Sentencing Transcript at 20), we remind Appellant--as the district court did more than once--that the guidelines call for the knowing creation of a substantial risk.   Here, a preponderance of the evidence supports the finding that Appellant was aware that a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury was \"practically certain\" to result from the use of a highly flammable accelerant for purposes of starting a fire.   Appellant presented no evidence to rebut the preponderance of the evidence presented on this point.   Furthermore, we find irrelevant whether or not Appellant was \"practically certain\" that an accidental ignition would occur given that the record supports a finding that he was \"practically certain\" that he was creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury.   Finally, the district court again correctly rejected Appellant's argument that he did not knowingly create a risk because no fire or explosion actually occurred.   See Honeycutt, 8 F.3d at 787 (\"[t]he fact that fortuitously no one was injured and extensive damage did not result does not further [A]ppellant's contention that he did not knowingly create a substantial risk.\").   At issue is Appellant's state of mind, not the actual results of his actions.  Id.;  cf. Medeiros, 897 F.2d at 20 (finding that the defendant \"specifically intended to cause the kind of fire that recklessly would endanger others\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p>C. Two-Level Enhancement for Leadership Role</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Appellant appeals the two-level enhancement which the district court imposed for his leadership role in the offense.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(c).   As we have said before, \"role in the offense\" determinations are fact intensive and we normally review for clear error.   See United States v. Tejada-Beltran, 50 F.3d 105, 111 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v. Schultz, 970 F.2d 960, 963-64 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 1069, 113 S.Ct. 1020, 122 L.Ed.2d 167 (1993) (citations omitted).   Appellant argues that he and Schaller were, at best, \"equals\" and nothing more than \"partners in crime.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(c), a two-level enhancement is warranted if the sentencing court determines that the criminal enterprise involved at least two participants, and the defendant exercised control over, or was otherwise responsible for organizing the activities of, at least one other individual in committing the crime.   See, e.g., Morillo, 8 F.3d at 872;  United States v. Akitoye, 923 F.2d 221, 227 (1st Cir.1991).   For purposes of determining the overall number of participants, the defendant himself may be counted as one participant;  \"[b]ut, he must exercise control over at least one other participant to warrant an upward adjustment.\"  Morillo, 8 F.3d at 872 n. 13.   In determining whether a defendant is an organizer or leader, the Sentencing Guidelines direct judges' attention to seven factors, including \"the exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1, comment.;   see Tejada-Beltran, 50 F.3d at 111-13 (\"This list is intended to be representative rather than exhaustive.\").   Finally, the government must bear the burden of proving that an upward role-in-the-offense adjustment is warranted.  Morillo, 8 F.3d at 872.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, it is undisputed that Appellant and Schaller participated in the attempted arson of the Galleria II.   Contrary to Appellant's contention that he and Schaller were mere \"equals,\" evidence was submitted at trial that it was Appellant's idea to burn the Galleria II;  that Appellant devised the time and method of committing the offense;  that Schaller was persuaded and, ultimately, recruited by Appellant after Appellant failed to hire someone else to commit the offense and after his unsuccessful attempt to start a fire in the attic;  and that Schaller poured the gasoline at Appellant's request and informed Appellant when he was finished.   Contrary to Appellant's argument, these factual findings satisfy the requirements for applying &#167; 3B1.1(c).   We are unpersuaded by Appellant's argument that the fact that Appellant asked or persuaded Schaller to pour gasoline does not show supervision over him.   While it may not show supervision, it certainly shows--at a minimum--Appellant's exercise of decision making authority, his recruitment of accomplices, and the greater degree of his participation in planning and organizing the two arson attempts.   Thus, finding no clear error in the district court's determination of Appellant's role,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a> we affirm the district court's two-level enhancement.

The district court denied both motions on the grounds that they were not timely filed pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 33 (providing, inter alia, seven-day filing period from the guilty verdict, or such time as the court may fix during the seven-day period, \"unless based on the ground of newly discovered evidence\" in which event it may be filed within two years after final judgment) and Fed.R.Crim.P. 45(b) (providing that the court may not extend the time for any action under, inter alia, Fed.R.Crim.P. 33).   Because Appellant's motion was not timely filed below, and because his arguments on appeal do not involve \"newly discovered evidence,\" we do not address this motion.   As we have held before, Fed.R.Crim.P. 33 is jurisdictional and the district court is without discretion to grant a motion for a new trial that is not timely filed.   See, e.g., United States v. Rogers, 41 F.3d 25, 34 (1st Cir.1994);  United States v.

As the court noted, \"fires are inherently dangerous, and the knowledge that firefighters and emergency personnel respond to virtually all fires can ordinarily be presumed.\"  Honeycutt, 8 F.3d at 787.  \"The arsonist must know that a specific fire for some reason poses a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to firefighters and emergency personnel who may respond.\"  Id</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn29\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29_ref\">29</a>\n        <p> The Model Penal Code's definition of \"knowingly\" provides that:</p>\n        <p>A person acts knowingly with respect to a material element of an offense when:  ...</p>\n        <p>(ii) if the element involves a result of his conduct, he is aware that it is practically certain that his conduct will cause such a result.</p>\n        <p>Model Penal Code &#167; 2.02(2)(b) (1985).   The Model Penal Code also states that \"[w]hen knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge is established if a person is aware of a high probability of its existence, unless he actually believes it does not exist.\"   Model Penal Code &#167; 2.02(7) (1985).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn30\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30_ref\">30</a>\n        <p> \"Constructive knowledge is the law's way of recognizing that, given an awareness of certain subsidiary facts, a person is quite likely to know, can be expected to know, or at least should have known that a further fact existed.\"  Spinney, 65 F.3d at 236.

The restaurant was located in a building which Appellant and Ashness leased from Dr. Aguiar and Fernando Lopes (\"Lopes\").   The lease agreement provided, among other things, for a monthly rent of $3,600 and an option for the restaurant owners to purchase Lopes' share in the property.   The restaurant received natural gas and food supplies that moved through interstate commerce. Although very successful during the summer months of 1991, its first year of operation, the Galleria II's business proved to be seasonal and business slowed considerably after the summer.   In addition to the slow business, there were significant problems with the building's water and septic systems and the relationship between Appellant and Dr. Aguiar deteriorated over who was responsible to pay for the required improvements:  the restaurant, as tenant, or Dr. Aguiar and Lopes, as landlords.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among the Galleria II's employees, Randy Schaller (\"Schaller\") served as chef and as kitchen manager;  and Shelley McKenna (\"McKenna\") served as the bar manager and hostess and was also responsible for the cash and bookkeeping.   Both Schaller and McKenna had longstanding business relationships with Appellant and considered him a friend.   Beginning in the fall of 1991, Appellant began discussing with Schaller the need for renovating the restaurant.   In addition to correcting the water and septic systems, Appellant proposed that an outside roof-top deck be installed for the purpose of increasing liquor sales during the peak summer season.   Appellant told Schaller that he wanted to finance the renovations by burning the top of the restaurant above the second floor as the insurance proceeds from the fire would provide funds for the renovations.   As part of his plan, Appellant increased the Galleria II's existing insurance coverage (building, contents, and premises liability) by purchasing $90,000 of business interruption insurance, which became effective December 3, 1991, two months before the arson attempts.   The proceeds from the business interruption coverage could have been used for any purpose, including for the repair of the water and septic systems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about February 19, 1992, after unsuccessfully attempting to hire someone else to burn the top of the restaurant, Appellant attempted to set a fire himself by igniting a stack of papers in the attic of the restaurant.   The fire burned out, however, before it could fully ignite the exposed wood frame.   Both Schaller and McKenna, who had been drawn to the attic because of the open attic door, discovered Appellant standing over the burning stack of papers and refused to get involved.   During the days following his first failed attempt, Appellant asked Schaller if he would help by pouring gasoline on the attic rafters as part of a plan whereby Appellant would return later to ignite the gasoline.   After repeatedly declining to get involved, Schaller finally agreed to assist Appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after noon on February 23, 1992, Schaller poured gasoline, as Appellant had requested, onto the exposed attic rafters and insulation and informed Appellant that he had done so.   About mid-afternoon, Appellant and Schaller left the restaurant.   At approximately 4:00 p.m. that same afternoon, the Westport Fire Department responded to a complaint from the restaurant that there was a strong odor of gas, which both patrons and employees at the restaurant had detected.   After evacuating the building, the firefighters discovered the gasoline-soaked boards and insulation as well as evidence of charring on the attic floor and ceiling.   According to the fire department, the charring was unrelated to the much larger area of the attic that was saturated with gasoline, representing a separate, previous attempt to start a fire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A few days later, Schaller admitted to the police that he had poured the gasoline.   Although Appellant told law enforcement officials that he would fire Schaller when they informed him of Schaller's confession, Appellant never fired Schaller, and Schaller worked at the restaurant until it closed.   On December 6, 1993, Schaller entered a plea of guilty to the federal indictment charging him with the second attempted arson.   Pursuant to his plea agreement, he agreed to cooperate with law enforcement officials.   As part of that cooperation, Schaller engaged in four conversations--three in person and one by telephone--with Appellant that were recorded by law enforcement agents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In July 1994, a two count indictment was returned by the federal grand jury charging Appellant with attempted arson of a building affecting interstate commerce under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(i) and conspiracy to commit arson under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371.   Prior to trial, Appellant filed a motion in limine to exclude from evidence the four recorded conversations between Appellant and Schaller, which included incriminating statements made by Appellant.   After a hearing, the court denied the motion and admitted the tapes after certain portions were excised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During a nine-day trial on the merits, in which nine witnesses testified for the prosecution (including Schaller, pursuant to his plea agreement), the prosecution presented its theory that Appellant attempted to burn the restaurant in order to recover insurance proceeds to finance renovations and improvements of the restaurant.   The defense called three witnesses, including McKenna.   Among other matters, the witnesses testified that Schaller's reputation for truthfulness was \"zero;\"  that the business interruption insurance was purchased as a result of significant storms which had caused the Galleria II to close;  that, after leaving with Schaller during the afternoon of February 22, Appellant had no intention of returning to the restaurant;  and that Appellant was with McKenna during the evening of February 22, planning their next day's business trip.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the trial, Appellant moved for a mistrial, which was denied, on the grounds that improper testimony regarding his ownership of a \"gay night club\" was prejudicial.   Both at the close of the government's case-in-chief and at the close of all the evidence, Appellant moved for judgment of acquittal on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to establish that the Galleria II was a building affecting interstate commerce.

On May 25, 1995, the district court sentenced Appellant to a term of seventy-eight (78) months' imprisonment, imposed a fine of $12,500, restitution to the Westport Police Department in the amount of $386, and ordered supervised release for three (3) years.

Appellant now argues that, in light of Lopez, the federal arson statute is unconstitutional and that, accordingly, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.

In support of this argument, Appellant insists that Lopez effectively overruled the Supreme Court's earlier decision in Russell v.

Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As with the federal arson statute at issue here, Congress has often invoked its authority under the Commerce Clause to federalize criminal activity.   Appellant points to Lopez and its invalidation of the Gun Free School Zone Act<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> as evidence that the Supreme Court's present position is to restrictively interpret the Commerce Clause when it is used as a foundation for a criminal statute.   See Lopez, --- U.S. at ---- n. 3, 115 S.Ct. at 1631 n. 3 (\"Under our federal system, the 'States possess primary authority for defining and enforcing the federal law.' \"  (quoting Brecht v. Abrahamson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112845\"><a href=\"/opinion/112845/brecht-v-abrahamson/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span>, 635, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112845\"><a href=\"/opinion/112845/brecht-v-abrahamson/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Lopez Court recognized three categories of activity which Congress may regulate under the Commerce Clause:  (i) \"the use of the channels of interstate commerce\";  (ii) \"the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities\";  and (iii) \"those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.\"  Lopez, --- U.S. at ---- - ----, 115 S.Ct. at 1629-30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Lopez, the Court explained in United States v.

See Robertson, --- U.S. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 1733.   The Court stated that the \" 'affecting commerce' test was developed in our jurisprudence to define the extent of Congress' power over purely intra state commercial activities that nonetheless have substantial inter state effects.\"  Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 1733 (emphasis in original) (concluding that transporting equipment and workers from out of state fell within 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(a)'s alternative criterion without regard to the \"affecting commerce\" test).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We consider the federal arson statute and the Court's pre-Lopez holding in Russell in light of this framework, concluding that Lopez does not invalidate 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(i).   First, by its plain language, Section 844(i) clearly falls under both the second and third Lopez categories in that it protects property that is either \"used in interstate or foreign commerce or in any activity affecting interstate or foreign commerce.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(i) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the federal arson statute contains the requisite \"jurisdictional element\" and thus is readily distinguishable from the provision invalidated in Lopez.   As we recently noted in Diaz-Martinez, the Supreme Court in Lopez \"found significant that the statute in that case, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(q) [the federal firearms possession statute], 'contain[ed] no jurisdictional element which would ensure, through case-by-case inquiry, that the firearm possession in question affects interstate commerce.' \"  Diaz- Martinez, 71 F.3d at 953 (quoting Lopez, --- U.S. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 1631).   We held that, unlike Lopez, the jurisdictional element was present in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(k) because it contains a specific requirement that the firearm with the obliterated serial number have been \"shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(k);  Diaz-Martinez, 71 F.3d at 953 (holding that \"[w]hatever the reach of Lopez, it does not invalidate 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(k)\").   Here, too, the federal arson statute contains the requisite jurisdictional element which similarly ensures that, case-by-case, the property damaged by the arson must have been \"used in interstate ... commerce or in an activity affecting interstate ... commerce.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(i).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, while the federal arson statute is similar to that struck down in Lopez in that it does not regulate commercial or economic activity, see United States v. Pappadopoulos, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"702611\"><a href=\"/opinion/702611/united-states-v-katherine-pappadopoulos/\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">522</span></a></span>, 526-27 (9th Cir.1995), it does regulate the damage or destruction of business property that satisfies the requisite interstate nexus, see Russell, 471 U.S. at 860-62, 105 S.Ct. at 2457 (\"Congress at least intended to protect all business property\");  United States v. Flaherty, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"712973\"><a href=\"/opinion/712973/united-states-v-john-charles-flaherty/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>, 974 (8th Cir.1996).   Particularly in the absence of any mention of Russell in the majority opinion of Lopez, we can find no reason to conclude that Lopez invalidates Russell 's analysis of Section 844(i)'s purpose and legislative history or its conclusion that the federal arson statute constitutionally regulates arson of business property that satisfies the requisite jurisdictional element.  Russell, 471 U.S. at 860-62, 105 S.Ct. at 2456-58.   After all, whatever Lopez ' reach, it certainly did not purport to overrule cases upholding application of the Commerce Clause power to wholly intrastate activities satisfying the requisite nexus to interstate commerce.   See United States v. Genao, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"715643\"><a href=\"/opinion/715643/united-states-v-maximo-genao-francisco-miguel-genao-robert-llin-jr-also/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1333</span></a></span>, 1336 (2d Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, we reject Appellant's argument that Section 844(i) is unconstitutional because it improperly intrudes into Massachusetts' primary authority for defining and enforcing the criminal law.   By virtue of the fact that the federal arson statute is a criminal law it indeed intrudes upon states' traditional dominion over the criminal law.  Lopez, --- U.S. at ---- n. 3, 115 S.Ct. at 1631 n. 3 (\"Under our federal system, the 'States possess primary authority for defining and enforcing the criminal law.' \"  (quoting Abrahamson, 507 U.S. at 635, 113 S.Ct. at 1720)).   However, \"not every federal foray into criminal law is invalid.\"  United States v. Bishop, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"705084\"><a href=\"/opinion/705084/united-states-v-kevin-bishop-united-states-of-america-v-edward-stokes/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">569</span></a></span>, 584 (3d Cir.1995) (rejecting Lopez-based challenge to the constitutionality of the federal carjacking statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2119).   Where, as here, the criminal statute satisfies the constitutional limits of the Commerce Clause, it withstands the challenge that it interferes with the states' ability to define and enforce the criminal law.   See Russell, 471 U.S. at 860-62, 105 S.Ct. at 2456-58.   Finally, we note that we join our fellow circuits in arriving at the conclusion that 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(i) passes constitutional muster under Lopez.   See, e.g., Flaherty, 76 F.3d at 974;  United States v. Denalli, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"70604\"><a href=\"/opinion/70604/united-states-v-denalli/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">328</span></a></span>, 329 (11th Cir.1996);  Sherlin, 67 F.3d at 1213-14;  Pappadopoulos, 64 F.3d at 526.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we find no basis to question the presumed validity of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(i), we conclude that the district court properly had subject-matter jurisdiction conferred by virtue of the fact that Appellant was charged with an \"offense against the United States.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3231.   See United States v.

Credibility determinations are uniquely within the jury's province;  and, we defer to their determinations and the verdict if the evidence can support varying inferences.   See, e.g., United States v.

See Pappadopoulos, 64 F.3d at 524;  Medeiros, 897 F.2d at 15-17 (stating that the government need only show a de minimis connection to interstate commerce in order to satisfy this element).   Thus, in order for Appellant to be found guilty under the federal arson statute, the government had to prove, among other things, that the property was either \"used in\" or \"used in an activity affecting\" interstate commerce.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(i).

At the time of the district court's decision, Lopez had not yet been decided and there was no reason for the district court to question the viability of Russell or Medeiros.   Under Medeiros, the government need only show, and the jury need only find, a de minimis connection to interstate commerce in order to sustain a conviction under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(i).  Medeiros, 897 F.2d at 16-17.   Here, the government presented uncontested evidence that the object of the attempted arsons was a \"building\" that was being \"used\" as a commercial establishment, the Galleria II restaurant.   The jury was presented with evidence that Appellant and his partners rented the building;  that the building was supplied with natural gas which traveled in interstate commerce;  and that the restaurant received food supplies for its operation which traveled in interstate commerce.   Indeed, Appellant conceded at oral argument that the building was used as a commercial establishment which received food supplies and natural gas for its operation that travelled in interstate commerce.   The district court correctly instructed the jury that the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Galleria II was property \"used in or [sic] affected interstate or foreign commerce.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury verdict, this evidence more than satisfies Medeiros ' de minimis requirement, and we therefore reject Appellant's insufficiency of the evidence argument.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  See, e.g., Ryan, 41 F.3d at 364 (the de minimis standard \"is easily met, even when the property is temporarily closed or vacant\");  U.S. v.

Sherlin, 67 F.3d at 1213 (finding that building used in educational business of college was building used in an activity affecting interstate commerce).   We, thus, reaffirm our holding in Medeiros that rental property is per se sufficiently connected to interstate commerce to confer federal jurisdiction under Section 844(i) and to satisfy the jurisdictional element.   See Medeiros, 897 F.2d at 16.   Because uncontested evidence was presented that, at the time of the attempted fires, Appellant and his partner rented the building in which the Galleria II was operated, the jury was presented with sufficient evidence to find that the building was \"used in an activity affecting\" interstate commerce within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(i)'s second category.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming further that Lopez undermines Russell and Medeiros ' holding regarding rental property, we would nonetheless affirm the jury's finding.   Because uncontested evidence was presented below that the building was used as a commercial establishment which received food supplies and natural gas for its operation that travelled in interstate commerce, the Galleria II also falls within 18 U.S.C. &#167; 844(i)'s \"real or personal property used in interstate ... commerce.\"   Because the Galleria II was property used in interstate commerce, we need not address whether its activities \"substantially affect[ed]\" interstate commerce.

The court decided to speak with the jurors individually to ascertain (i) whether the juror was affected by the testimony in any way;  (ii) whether the juror would remain impartial;  and (iii) whether the juror would be able to render a verdict based on the evidence and the law as instructed by the court, without regard to the fact that Appellant operated a gay night club.   After every juror responded that he or she would not be affected by the testimony in rendering his or her verdict, (Transcript, Vol. 4 at 101-12), the court concluded, \"All right.   I'm satisfied.\"  (Transcript, Vol. 4 at 113).   At this point, and without further comment by counsel, testimony resumed.

The government argues that this polling effectively provided a curative instruction that the jurors were not to consider evidence that Appellant operated a gay night club in determining guilt or innocence.   Given the questions asked and the responses received, we agree that the district court \"efficaciously dispelled\" any prejudicial effect of Schaller's statement by its immediate and thorough response.

In denying Appellant's motion in limine to exclude the tapes in their entirety under Fed.R.Evid. 403 and 404(b), the district court found that they were admissible as probative of the issues raised in the case and that they were \"overall more relevant\" than prejudicial.  (Transcript, Vol. 2 at 12-13).   The district court, however, did allow Appellant to make specific objections of undue prejudice.  (Transcript, Vol. 2 at 13-15).   After hearing argument from counsel, (Transcript, Vol. 4 at 4-47), the district court agreed with most of Appellant's specific objections and excluded those portions.   With respect to Appellant's audibility argument, the district court only found the March 1, 1994, tape troubling in that it \"seems ... just woefully inadequate for any reasonable person to understand.\"  (Transcript, Vol. 2-17).   The district court's concern was that the only way to understand the tape was to read the transcript which resulted in the transcript--and the Government's view--being given too much weight.   After considering alternatives and hearing arguments from counsel, the district court decided to admit the tape and allow the transcript because both parties had stipulated to the accuracy of the transcript as a true rendition of the recording.  (Transcript, Vol. 2 at 4;  Vol. 4 at 4).   Finally, the district court gave cautionary instructions to the jury that the tapes were evidence but that the transcripts were not.   The district court also ruled that the transcripts would not be permitted during deliberations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  (Transcript, Vol. 4 at 4-5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn to Appellant's arguments, reviewing the district court's decision to admit or exclude evidence under Fed.R.Evid. 403 and 404(b) for abuse of discretion.   See, e.g., United States v.

The same standard of review applies regarding the district court's decision to admit the tapes over Appellant's audibility argument.   See United States v.

In support of his argument, Appellant claims that (i) none of Appellant's statements prove any element of the alleged crimes or show consciousness of guilt;  (ii) the recorded conversations took place two years after the predicate offenses occurred;  (iii) many of Appellant's arguments were made in response to questions instigated by the government witness;  and, (iv) any relevant conversations were intertwined with others that were not relevant.   We find none of these arguments persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court found, the tapes included highly probative evidence regarding Appellant's consciousness of guilt, including admissions.   The tapes were directly relevant to the government's theory regarding both Appellant's involvement in the attempted arson and the conspiracy.   Indeed, we note that Appellant's counsel conceded as much during the hearing on the tapes' admissibility:  \"I concede, Judge, that there were parts that, given the Government's position and its interpretation, are relevant.\"  (Transcript, Vol. 2 at 12).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, the February 24, 1994, tape includes a conversation regarding the payment of Schaller's legal fees.   Not only did it corroborate Schaller's testimony that Appellant assisted in the payment of Schaller's legal fees, this conversation included evidence from which the jury could draw an inference \"that this money is being paid because these gentlemen were in on the deal together.\"  (Transcript, Vol. 4 at 9).   The March 1, 1994, tape includes an admission by Appellant that he threw matches to light the fire during the first attempt:  \"You weren't there when I threw the [expletive] matches the first time.\"   The March 4, 1994, tape includes an adoptive admission by Appellant regarding his attempts to burn the restaurant during a conversation about whether Appellant had told anyone about those efforts.   While Appellant denies telling anybody else about his efforts, he responds to Schaller's questions directly without ever disputing the veracity of what Schaller's questions imply--that Appellant \"tried to burn it.\"   The May 25, 1994, tape provides evidence of the conspiracy between Schaller and Appellant.   The conversation demonstrates that, although they were confused as to their recollection of what they believed to be their respective roles, they clearly had conspired to burn the restaurant.   This sampling of each of the four tapes clearly shows that, contrary to Appellant's claims, the recordings include statements by Appellant that are directly probative of both attempts and the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant also points to the fact that the recorded conversations occurred two years after the alleged offenses, arguing that the recordings are neither closely intertwined with the charged offenses nor helpful in establishing Appellant's intent to commit the crimes charged.   Appellant cites to three cases addressing the admissibility of evidence under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b).   See United States v. Huff, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580002\"><a href=\"/opinion/580002/united-states-v-wayne-morris-huff-united-states-of-america-v-henry-love/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span>, 736 (8th Cir.1992);  United States v.

We agree with these cases that proximity in time is a factor to be considered in determining relevancy under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) of \"other crimes, wrongs, or acts.\"   See, e.g., United States v.

Because the conversations here occurred two years after the predicate offenses, Appellant contends that the tapes cannot be said to be so \"closely intertwined\" with the predicate offenses so as to help establish Appellant's intent to commit the crimes charged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are unswayed by Appellant's arguments.   Here, as we discuss below, no evidence of prior bad acts was admitted in this case;  and, because Appellant has not cited to any cases holding that proximity in time is a prerequisite for determining relevance under Fed.R.Evid. 403, and because we have not found any, we are unconvinced that the timing of the conversations is of any consequence or otherwise undermines their strong relevance.

Neither the fact that many of Appellant's remarks were made in response to questions or comments by the government witness, nor that relevant conversations were intertwined with non-relevant ones, persuades us to reach a different conclusion.   Even the fact that the recordings reveal that Appellant had initially wanted to hire \"a guy from organized crime so to speak\" to burn the restaurant, (Transcript, Vol. 4 at 32), or that Appellant tells Schaller what to say about pouring the gasoline, (Transcript, Vol. 4 at 44), does not make them unfairly prejudicial.

While the district court found that there were segments of poor audio and static, the district court nonetheless decided to admit them.   The district court was swayed by the fact that the parties stipulated to the accuracy of the transcript as a true recording of the tapes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>  We are similarly swayed and find no abuse of the court's broad discretion, even as to the March 1, 1994, tape about which the district court was most concerned.   Based on our review of the transcript,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a> we disagree with Appellant's claim that the inaudible parts, when taken as a whole, were so substantial as to make the rest more misleading than helpful, because the transcript clearly evidences that sufficient portions of the tapes, including statements by both Schaller and Appellant, are audible.   As discussed earlier, these segments are relevant because they include, inter alia, admissions by Appellant, tending to show consciousness of guilt and corroborate trial testimony.   Furthermore, the district court gave a cautionary instruction to the jury that not only informed them that the tapes, but not the transcript, were evidence, but also that the jurors had to draw their own conclusions regarding their content and probative value based on what they themselves heard on the tapes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a>  United States v.

We address them in turn, reviewing findings of fact for clear error, mindful that they need only be supported by a preponderance of the evidence, and reviewing questions of law de novo, including the scope and applicability of a relevant guideline.   See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(e);  United States v.

The \"Fraud or Deceit\" Base Offense Level</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Appellant contends that the district court should have applied U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K1.4(a)(3), which requires computation of the base offense level as 2 plus the base offense level for \"Fraud and Deceit.\"   Appellant argues that the overwhelming evidence at trial established that his primary purpose was to defraud the insurance company and that Appellant, while creating some risk of death or serious bodily injury by pouring gasoline, did not knowingly create a substantial risk.   While the record does indicate that Appellant participated in a scheme to defraud the insurance company, we conclude that the district court properly chose subparagraph &#167; 2K1.4(a)(1) based on its specific finding--which, as we discuss below, was not clearly erroneous--that Appellant knowingly created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to persons other than the participants in the attempted arson.   See Grimes, 967 F.2d at 1472 (holding that district court properly rejected application of fraud guideline, &#167; 2K1.4(a)(3), and properly applied &#167; 2K1.4(a)(2) in case involving defendant's effort to obtain insurance through arson where defendant created substantial risk of injury or death).   The arson guideline instructs that the base offense level is determined by selecting the highest level from among four choices.   Section 2K1.4(a)(1)-(4);  United States v. Mizrachi, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"690277\"><a href=\"/opinion/690277/united-states-v-nissim-mizrachi/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">651</span></a></span>, 655 (2d Cir.1995).   The Government contends that applying &#167; 2K1.4(a)(3) would only yield a base offense level of 19, less than that under &#167; 2K1.4(a)(1), which is 24.   Appellant does not dispute this calculation or otherwise present his own &#167; 2K1.4(a)(3) calculation, nor was there any discussion of this issue during the sentencing hearing.   Assuming, without deciding, that calculation under &#167; 2K1.4(a)(3) would have yielded only a base offense level of 19, we conclude that the district court correctly applied &#167; 2K1.4(a)(1) because it yielded the highest base offense level based on its finding that Appellant knowingly created a substantial risk of bodily injury.   Cf. Mizrachi, 48 F.3d at 656 (affirming district court's application of &#167; 2K1.4(a)(3) in sentencing defendant for arson, mail fraud, and money laundering offenses where facts yielded an initial base offense level of 35).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Knowing Creation of a Substantial Risk</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Appellant argues that the district court's finding that Appellant knowingly created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to any person other than a participant in the offense is not supported by a preponderance of the evidence.   Whether a defendant knowingly created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury within the meaning of section 2K1.4 of the Guidelines raises an issue of first impression in that this court has not previously determined what level of knowledge is required under &#167; 2K1.4(a)(1)(A).   At the outset, we note that this determination involves a two-step inquiry.   A court must first ask whether the defendant's actions created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury and then decide whether the defendant acted knowingly in creating that risk.   See United States v. Karlic, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610670\"><a href=\"/opinion/610670/united-states-v-lorenz-vilim-karlic/\"><span class=\"volume\">997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span>, 568-69 (9th Cir.1993) (stating that the first inquiry is objective and the second is subjective).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p>1. The Substantial Risk ...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leaving aside the question of knowledge for the moment, we conclude first that the district court did not clearly err in finding that Appellant created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to any person other than a participant in the offense.   The district court based its finding primarily on the PSR, which indicated, inter alia, that the presence of gasoline created the potential for a fire or explosion.   According to the PSR, a fuel air explosion could have occurred had \"a heat source been introduced within a specific danger range between the place where the gasoline was poured and anyplace within the building where the odor of gasoline was detected,\" (PSR, at 22), and that \"because the gasoline was poured in a confined area which contained electrical outlets, an electrical spark or other heat source could have ignited the vapors in the confined area at any time,\" (PSR, at 23).   Although the evidence indicates that Appellant only planned to ignite the fire after the restaurant closed, the district court concluded that the potential for a fuel air explosion or for a fire to start accidentally created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to the occupants of the building at the time of the pouring of the gasoline in the attic as well as to firefighters and others who would respond to the incident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no clear error in this finding of substantial risk to patrons and firefighters.   It was properly based on both the PSR and the sentencing judge's common sense understanding--which Appellant conceded during the sentencing hearing was appropriate--of the risks associated with pouring an accelerant to start a fire in an occupied building where there was the potential for a fuel air explosion to occur or for a fire to start accidentally. See Medeiros, 897 F.2d at 20 (relying on common sense in finding under earlier arson guidelines that defendant conspired \"to cause the kind of fire that recklessly would endanger others.\").   As the district court correctly noted in response to Appellant's insistence that there was no risk created because no fire actually occurred, (Sentencing Transcript, pages 19-22), the Guidelines speak of \"risk.\"  \"The fact that fortuitously no one was injured and extensive damage did not result [because no fire or explosion actually occurred] does not further [A]ppellant's contention that he did not ... create a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury.\"  United States v. Honeycutt, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"656202\"><a href=\"/opinion/656202/united-states-v-rick-steven-honeycutt/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">785</span></a></span>, 787 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, in light of the federal arson guidelines' commentary, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K1.4, Application Note 2, we find no clear error in the district court's finding of substantial risk given its finding that firefighters \"could have been blown to smithereens\" had a spark ignited the gasoline vapors (Sentencing Transcript, at 20).   See, e.g., Turner, 995 F.2d at 1365;  Grimes, 967 F.2d at 1471.   While \"all fires present some danger to firefighters required to extinguish it, ... [w]here a spectacular fire is planned near an occupied building, a finding of reckless endangerment to firefighters would be based on a common sense understanding of the risks of putting out a major fire when rescue attempts are likely to be necessary.\"  Medeiros, 897 F.2d at 20.   Similarly, here, although there is no evidence that Appellant planned a \"spectacular fire,\" the sentencing judge's finding of substantial risk in this case was based on his--and, again, our--common sense understanding of the risks associated with using an accelerant in an occupied building to start a fire where there was the potential for a fuel air explosion to occur or for a fire to start accidentally.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. ... Knowingly Created</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, we must decide whether the district court clearly erred when it found that Appellant knowingly created this substantial risk.   While we review the court's factual finding for clear error, the definition of a Guidelines term is a question of law which we review de novo.  Martinez-Martinez, 69 F.3d at 1224.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Looking first to the statute, we note that the two highest base offense levels in the federal arson guidelines, &#167; 2K1.4(a)(1) and &#167; 2K1.4(a)(2), contain almost identical language.   The latter, for which there is a base offense level of 20, applies to the creation of a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury.   The former, for which there is a base offense level of 24, applies to the knowing creation of such a risk.   This structure clearly suggests that there must be a meaningful distinction between the two sections.   See Honeycutt, 8 F.3d at 787 (noting that \"[c]learly it was intended for there to be a distinction between the two sections\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a>  Given the structure of the arson guidelines, we conclude that &#167; 2K1.4(a)(1)(A) requires that the district court make a specific finding that the defendant \"knowingly\" created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury, as opposed to merely finding that defendant recklessly (or negligently) created such a risk which would more appropriately trigger application of &#167; 2K1.4(a)(1)(B).   Apart from this rather straightforward observation, no guidance is gleaned from the Sentencing Guidelines, as \"knowingly\" is not defined.   In addition, the usual rule of giving an undefined statutory term its plain meaning provides little direction given that \" '[k]nowledge' means different things in different contexts.\"  United States v. Spinney, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196301\"><a href=\"/opinion/196301/united-states-v-spinney/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></a></span>, 236 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our own precedent is of little help because, while this court has addressed the application of the federal arson guidelines, see Medeiros, 897 F.2d at 18 (applying former U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K1.4(b)(2) and affirming district court's finding that defendant \"recklessly endangered the safety of another\");  see also, United States v.

See Honeycutt, 8 F.3d at 787;  United States v. Karlic, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610670\"><a href=\"/opinion/610670/united-states-v-lorenz-vilim-karlic/\"><span class=\"volume\">997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span>, 569 (9th Cir.1993).   Drawing from the MPC's definition,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a> the Ninth Circuit held that \"a defendant can be found to have 'knowingly' created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury under &#167; 2K1.4 only if the defendant was aware that a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury was 'practically certain' to result from the criminal act.\"  Karlic, 997 F.2d at 569;  accord, Honeycutt, 8 F.3d at 787.   We note that other courts have neither explicitly defined \"knowingly\" nor adopted the MPC's definition, apparently finding it unnecessary where the district court could clearly conclude from the facts whether the defendant knew his actions created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury.   For example, in United States v.

As to the defendant's knowledge, the court found that defendant knowingly created the substantial risk given that people in the residence adjacent to the burning building were likely to be asleep and windy conditions would cause the fire to spread quickly.  Id. at 1365.   The court in Turner also found that defendant \"should have known\" that he was placing firefighters at a substantial risk by committing the arson in weather conditions that would make extinguishing the fire extremely difficult.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As this relevant case law provides at least two distinct approaches, we find it helpful when considering the question of \"knowledge\" to recall that \"the length of the hypothetical knowledge continuum\" is marked by \"constructive knowledge\" at one end and \"actual knowledge\" at the other with various \"gradations,\" such as \"notice of likelihood\" in the \"poorly charted area that stretches between the poles.\"  Spinney, 65 F.3d at 236-37 (discussing the continuum in the context of the \"shared knowledge\" requirement in prosecution of aiding and abetting armed robbery).   In terms of this continuum, \"practical certainty\" would seem most akin to \"actual knowledge.\"  Id. (noting that \"[a]ctual knowledge, after all, is certain knowledge\").   We are inclined to conclude that a showing of knowledge anywhere along this continuum satisfies application of &#167; 2K1.4(a)(1)(A).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a>  This approach would be consistent both with the guidelines' mandate that a meaningful distinction be made between the two highest base offense levels as well as with the \"common sense\" approach we endorsed in Medeiros.   See Medeiros, 897 F.2d at 20.   That said, however, at this juncture we need not definitively resolve what level of knowledge, in addition to \"actual knowledge,\" is required.   Even assuming without deciding that, for &#167; 2K1.4(a)(1)(A) to apply, Appellant had to be \"aware that a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury was 'practically certain' to result from the criminal act,\" Karlic, 997 F.2d at 569, we reject Appellant's contention that the district court's findings are clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Appellant argues that the district court clearly erred in finding that he knowingly created the substantial risk, because \"[it] made no finding that a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury was 'practically certain' to result from his [attempted arson].\"  Appellant contends that the district court's findings that the restaurant was occupied at the time the gasoline was poured and that the vapors could have been accidentally ignited is insufficient for the application of &#167; 2K1.4(a)(1)(A), because the record does not show by a preponderance of the evidence that Appellant was \"practically certain\" that an accidental cause could have started the fire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Giving due deference to the court's application of the guidelines to the facts, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that Appellant \"knew that ... there was a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury\" (Sentencing Transcript at 23).   In arriving at our conclusion, we note that facts contained in a presentence report ordinarily are considered reliable evidence for sentencing purposes.   See United States v. Morillo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195011\"><a href=\"/opinion/195011/united-states-v-morillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">864</span></a></span>, 872 (1st Cir.1993).   Indeed, district courts possess \"broad discretion to determine what data is, or is not, sufficiently dependable to be used in imposing sentence.\"  United States v. Tardiff, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587242\"><a href=\"/opinion/587242/united-states-v-claude-paul-tardiff/\"><span class=\"volume\">969</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1283</span></a></span>, 1287 (1st Cir.1992).   This is particularly true where, as here, Appellant offered no evidence to suggest an inaccuracy in the presentence report's facts.  Id., 8 F.3d at 873 (collecting cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record shows that, at the time of the first attempt,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a> Appellant knew that at least two other employees, including Schaller (who at that time was not a participant in the offense), were in the restaurant.   As the court in Honeycutt noted, \"[i]t is difficult to imagine a clearer illustration of the knowing creation of a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury.\"  Honeycutt, 8 F.3d at 787 (affirming application of &#167; 2K1.4(a)(1)(A) where defendant threw a Molotov cocktail at a structure that he admitted he knew was occupied).   In terms of our continuum, this strikes us as constituting \"actual knowledge\" and/or \"practical certainty.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the second attempt, the record shows that gasoline was poured, hours before the intended ignition, in a confined area atop the Galleria II at a time when both patrons and employees were inside.   Appellant knew gasoline was a highly flammable liquid and he arranged for it to be poured for the specific intent of lighting a fire after business hours.   In response to Appellant's \"practical certainty\" argument, the district court found that \"the fact that [Appellant] ... wanted to [ignite] the fire outside of business hours, suggests ... that he knew of the risk\" to people inside the building and to those who would respond to the fire.  (Sentencing Transcript at 18).   Contrary to Appellant's contentions, these findings are sufficient for the application of the highest base offense level.   While Appellant may not have been aware that it was \"practically certain\" that a fire could ignite accidentally or that the restaurant and any occupants could be blown to \"smithereens,\" (Sentencing Transcript at 20), we remind Appellant--as the district court did more than once--that the guidelines call for the knowing creation of a substantial risk.   Here, a preponderance of the evidence supports the finding that Appellant was aware that a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury was \"practically certain\" to result from the use of a highly flammable accelerant for purposes of starting a fire.   Appellant presented no evidence to rebut the preponderance of the evidence presented on this point.   Furthermore, we find irrelevant whether or not Appellant was \"practically certain\" that an accidental ignition would occur given that the record supports a finding that he was \"practically certain\" that he was creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury.   Finally, the district court again correctly rejected Appellant's argument that he did not knowingly create a risk because no fire or explosion actually occurred.   See Honeycutt, 8 F.3d at 787 (\"[t]he fact that fortuitously no one was injured and extensive damage did not result does not further [A]ppellant's contention that he did not knowingly create a substantial risk.\").   At issue is Appellant's state of mind, not the actual results of his actions.  Id.;  cf. Medeiros, 897 F.2d at 20 (finding that the defendant \"specifically intended to cause the kind of fire that recklessly would endanger others\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p>C.

See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(c).   As we have said before, \"role in the offense\" determinations are fact intensive and we normally review for clear error.   See United States v. Tejada-Beltran, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"691951\"><a href=\"/opinion/691951/united-states-v-maximo-e-tejada-beltran-alias-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span>, 111 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v.

Appellant argues that he and Schaller were, at best, \"equals\" and nothing more than \"partners in crime.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(c), a two-level enhancement is warranted if the sentencing court determines that the criminal enterprise involved at least two participants, and the defendant exercised control over, or was otherwise responsible for organizing the activities of, at least one other individual in committing the crime.   See, e.g., Morillo, 8 F.3d at 872;  United States v. Akitoye, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"554021\"><a href=\"/opinion/554021/united-states-v-adegboyega-akitoye/\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">221</span></a></span>, 227 (1st Cir.1991).   For purposes of determining the overall number of participants, the defendant himself may be counted as one participant;  \"[b]ut, he must exercise control over at least one other participant to warrant an upward adjustment.\"  Morillo, 8 F.3d at 872 n. 13.   In determining whether a defendant is an organizer or leader, the Sentencing Guidelines direct judges' attention to seven factors, including \"the exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1, comment.;   see Tejada-Beltran, 50 F.3d at 111-13 (\"This list is intended to be representative rather than exhaustive.\").   Finally, the government must bear the burden of proving that an upward role-in-the-offense adjustment is warranted.  Morillo, 8 F.3d at 872.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, it is undisputed that Appellant and Schaller participated in the attempted arson of the Galleria II.   Contrary to Appellant's contention that he and Schaller were mere \"equals,\" evidence was submitted at trial that it was Appellant's idea to burn the Galleria II;  that Appellant devised the time and method of committing the offense;  that Schaller was persuaded and, ultimately, recruited by Appellant after Appellant failed to hire someone else to commit the offense and after his unsuccessful attempt to start a fire in the attic;  and that Schaller poured the gasoline at Appellant's request and informed Appellant when he was finished.   Contrary to Appellant's argument, these factual findings satisfy the requirements for applying &#167; 3B1.1(c).   We are unpersuaded by Appellant's argument that the fact that Appellant asked or persuaded Schaller to pour gasoline does not show supervision over him.   While it may not show supervision, it certainly shows--at a minimum--Appellant's exercise of decision making authority, his recruitment of accomplices, and the greater degree of his participation in planning and organizing the two arson attempts.   Thus, finding no clear error in the district court's determination of Appellant's role,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a> we affirm the district court's two-level enhancement.

The district court denied both motions on the grounds that they were not timely filed pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 33 (providing, inter alia, seven-day filing period from the guilty verdict, or such time as the court may fix during the seven-day period, \"unless based on the ground of newly discovered evidence\" in which event it may be filed within two years after final judgment) and Fed.R.Crim.P. 45(b) (providing that the court may not extend the time for any action under, inter alia, Fed.R.Crim.P. 33).   Because Appellant's motion was not timely filed below, and because his arguments on appeal do not involve \"newly discovered evidence,\" we do not address this motion.

As the court noted, \"fires are inherently dangerous, and the knowledge that firefighters and emergency personnel respond to virtually all fires can ordinarily be presumed.\"  Honeycutt, 8 F.3d at 787.  \"The arsonist must know that a specific fire for some reason poses a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to firefighters and emergency personnel who may respond.\"  Id</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn29\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29_ref\">29</a>\n        <p> The Model Penal Code's definition of \"knowingly\" provides that:</p>\n        <p>A person acts knowingly with respect to a material element of an offense when:  ...</p>\n        <p>(ii) if the element involves a result of his conduct, he is aware that it is practically certain that his conduct will cause such a result.</p>\n        <p>Model Penal Code &#167; 2.02(2)(b) (1985).   The Model Penal Code also states that \"[w]hen knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge is established if a person is aware of a high probability of its existence, unless he actually believes it does not exist.\"   Model Penal Code &#167; 2.02(7) (1985).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn30\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30_ref\">30</a>\n        <p> \"Constructive knowledge is the law's way of recognizing that, given an awareness of certain subsidiary facts, a person is quite likely to know, can be expected to know, or at least should have known that a further fact existed.\"  Spinney, 65 F.3d at 236.   In contrast, \"[a]ctual knowledge, as the term implies, reduces the need for inference;  it suggests the presence of particular evidence which, if credited, establishes conclusively that the person in question knew of the existence of the fact in question.\"  Id</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn31\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31_ref\">31</a>\n        <p> We address the first count (the attempt to start a fire in the attic with paper) even though Appellant's brief only focuses on the second count (involving the gasoline)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn32\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32_ref\">32</a>\n        <p> Appellant also contends that \"[t]he finding that [Appellant] stood to gain financially from the fire is also erroneous.\"   The government argued that Appellant--and not Schaller, who had no ownership interest in the restaurant or the building--stood to gain financially from a fire at the Galleria II and, thus, had a \"claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1, comment.   We need not address this argument as the district court neither made, nor relied on, this \"finding\" when it concluded that adjustment under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1 was justified.   See Sentencing Transcript, page 28.   Even assuming arguendo that such a \"finding\" were clearly erroneous, we would nonetheless affirm the district court's adjustment based on the evidence of Appellant's role in the offense</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
