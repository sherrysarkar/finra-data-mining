Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                     Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n                 Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                   and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\nJames R. Knudsen on brief for appellant.\r\nDonald K. Stern, United States Attorney, and Jennifer Zacks,\r\nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                       March 17, 1998\r\n                                         \r\n\n  Per Curiam.  Appellant John Scuderi (\"Scuderi\") was\r\nconvicted of conspiracy and trafficking in counterfeit goods,\r\nthrough his operation of Marco Polo International (\"Marco\r\nPolo\"), in violation of 18 U.S.C.  371 &amp; 2320.  Based on the\r\ndistrict court's finding that he had trafficked in counterfeit\r\ngoods valued at more than $350,000, Scuderi was sentenced to a\r\nterm of imprisonment of 37 months, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \r\n2B5.3 &amp; 2F1.1(b)(1)(J).  We have reviewed the briefs of the\r\nparties and the record on appeal, and we summarily affirm.\r\n    Scuderi recites correctly that it is the government's\r\nburden to prove the retail value of the infringing items by a\r\npreponderance of the evidence and that the court's\r\ndetermination of such value need not be precise.  See, e.g.,\r\nUnited States v. Kim, 963 F.2d 65, 69 (5th Cir. 1992).  We\r\nreview the factual conclusions of the sentencing court for\r\nclear error.  See United States v. Damon, 127 F.3d 139, 141\r\n(1st Cir. 1997).  Contrary to Scuderi's contention, however,\r\nthere was no clear error in the district court's determination\r\nin this case.\r\n    The presentence report adequately supported its sales\r\nfigure of $477,000 using a tax return and bank statements as\r\nsources.  At sentencing, Scuderi was only able to identify\r\napproximately $17,000 in Victoria's Secret clothing as\r\nlegitimate merchandise.  He argued that some handbags, sheets\r\nand pillowcases were also legitimate merchandise, but offered\r\nno specific number of these allegedly legitimate items.  The\r\ndistrict court did credit Scuderi with some amount for the\r\nlegitimate Victoria's Secret merchandise and for sales taxes,\r\nfinding the retail value of the infringing items to be\r\napproximately $400,000, rather than $477,000.\r\n    Scuderi's argument on appeal essentially is that the\r\ngovernment failed to carry its burden of proof as to the extent\r\nof counterfeit merchandise sold by Marco Polo.  He continues to\r\nargue that some handbags, sheets and pillowcases sold were\r\nlegitimate merchandise, but he provides no specific number of\r\nthese allegedly legitimate items.  Scuderi cannot successfully\r\nchallenge the court's determination by \"a general objection, in\r\nthe form of a claim that the [presentence] report does not\r\nsatisfy the government's burden of proof.\"  United States v.\r\nWashington, 115 F.3d 1008, 1010 (D.C. Cir. 1997).  Such a\r\ngeneral objection is essentially all that Scuderi has raised\r\nhere.\r\n    Affirmed.  Loc. R. 27.1.\r\n",
