In this case, a number of residents of the\n\ntowns of Scituate and Cohasset, Massachusetts, have brought suit\n\nin federal district court against Omnipoint Communications, Inc.\n\nand related entities and the Scituate Planning Board.                         The aim\n\nis to nullify a permit for a cellular telephone relay tower.\n\nThe    permit    was    previously        granted       pursuant    to   a    judicial\n\nsettlement      reached      in    an    action    by   Omnipoint    against     town\n\nauthorities under the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (TCA), 47\n\nU.S.C. § 332 (1994 & Supp. II 1996).\n\n           The thrust of the present suit is that the permit\n\nviolates state law in various respects, both substantive and\n\nprocedural.      (There are boilerplate references to the federal\n\nConstitution in the complaint but the district court said that\n\nthey   were     undeveloped        and    appellants'      brief    in   this   court\n\nsimilarly contains no developed constitutional argument.)                          The\n\ndistrict court dismissed the complaint on the ground that it\n\nconstituted an impermissible collateral attack on the prior\n\nfederal judgment mandating the permit.                    Patterson v. Omnipoint\n\nCommunications, Inc., 122 F. Supp. 2d 222, 226 (D. Mass. 2000).\n\n           Appellants' professed basis for jurisdiction in the\n\ndistrict   court       was   solely      the     TCA,   but   the   only     seemingly\n\n                                           -2-\n\fpertinent      provision    allows   a   suit   against    state      or   local\n\ngovernment action that is \"inconsistent\" with TCA provisions.\n\nThe district court thought that jurisdiction might yet be proper\n\ninsofar   as    the   complaint,     although   addressed       to   state   law\n\nviolations, itself implicated a substantial question of federal\n\nlaw, presumably the preemptive authority of the TCA.                 Brehmer v.\n\nPlanning Bd. of Town of Wellfleet, 238 F.3d 117, 119 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).\n\n            However this may be, the only relief sought was plainly\n\nbeyond the authority of the district court.                A prior federal\n\ndecree commanded the issuance of the permit; a suit to enjoin\n\nthe local board from carrying through with the prior decree was\n\nnothing more than a collateral attack on the decree.                   Brehmer\n\nitself rejected just such an attack, 238 F.3d at 121, and\n\nBrehmer is not only persuasive but is binding on the panel.\n\nUnited States v. Lewko, 269 F.3d 64, 66 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            Appellants say that it is unfair for them to have no\n\nopportunity to contest a decree to which they were not parties.\n\nBut   assuming    that     they   satisfied   standing    and    intervention\n\nrequirements--issues on which we take no position--they were\n\nfree to seek to participate at the time that the original decree\n\nwas approved.
