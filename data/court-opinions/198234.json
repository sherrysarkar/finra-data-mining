RIVERA,\r\n\n                    Plaintiff, Appellant,\r\n\n                              v.\r\n\n               COMMISSIONER OF SOCIAL SECURITY,\r\n\n                     Defendant, Appellee.\r\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n               FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\r\n\n       [Hon. Salvador E. Casellas, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n             Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Melba N. Rivera-Camacho and Melba N. Rivera Camacho &amp; Assocs.on brief for appellant.\r\n   Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Lilliam Mendoza-Torro,\r\nAssistant U.S. Attorney and Wayne G. Lewis, Assistant Regional\r\nCounsel on brief for appellee.\r\n\nDecember 9, 1998\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  After carefully considering the full\r\nrecord and the parties' briefs, we agree that there was\r\nsubstantial evidence to support the decision of the\r\nCommissioner of Social Security that claimant's back condition,\r\nemotional impairment, and diabetes did not render claimant\r\ndisabled prior the date he (claimant) reached 60 years of age. \r\nThe judgment of the district court in regard to these\r\nconditions is therefore affirmed for essentially the reasons\r\nstated in the magistrate judge's Report and Recommendation\r\nwhich was adopted by the district court on January 22, 1998. \r\nWe reach a different conclusion in relation to the carpal\r\ntunnel syndrome.\r\n           Where, as here, sedentary work is involved, \"good use\r\nof the hands and fingers\" is required.  See Heggarty v.\r\nSullivan, 947 F.2d 990, 996 (1st Cir. 1991) (per curiam)\r\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  In\r\ndetermining that claimant's carpal tunnel syndrome did not\r\nresult in any significant manipulative limitations, the only\r\nmedical evidence before the administrative law judge (ALJ) was\r\nthe diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome, the test report\r\nconfirming the diagnosis, and the observation that claimant had\r\nlost strength in his left hand.  The physicians who reported on\r\nthe carpal tunnel syndrome, however, did not apply their\r\nfindings to any vocational criteria as required by the\r\nregulations.  See 20 C.F.R.  404.1513(b) and (c) (medical\r\nreports should include \"[a] statement about what you can still\r\n                              -2-\r\ndo despite your impairment(s),\" including a statement about the\r\nability to do work-related activities such as \"handling\r\nobjects\").  Thus, the ALJ was confronted with only \"raw medical\r\ndata.\"  We have held that, as a lay factfinder, an ALJ lacks\r\nsufficient expertise to interpret such data.  See Rivera-\r\nFigueroa v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 858 F.2d\r\n48, 52 (1st Cir. 1988) (per curiam); Berrios v. Secretary of\r\nHealth and Human Services, 796 F.2d 574, 576 (1st Cir. 1986)\r\n(per curiam) (a lay person such an ALJ is not competent to\r\ninterpret \"raw, technical medical data\").\r\n           Given this state of the record, the evidence, at the\r\nleast, is ambiguous regarding the disabling effects of the\r\ncarpal tunnel syndrome.  One question, for example, is whether\r\nthe carpal tunnel syndrome precluded any sedentary work\r\nclaimant could do   i.e., whether claimant was disabled prior\r\nto the date he turned 60.  Since (1) the burden is on the\r\nCommissioner at step five of the sequential process, (2)\r\nclaimant was not represented at the hearing by an attorney, (3)\r\nthe claim regarding the carpal tunnel syndrome \"itself seems on\r\nits face to be substantial,\" and (4) there are significant gaps\r\nin the record, a remand is required for the Commissioner to\r\nobtain further evidence.  See Heggarty, 947 F.2d at 997-98. \r\nSuch evidence should include a consultation with an MA for the\r\npurpose of having the MA interpret the medical data in lay\r\nterms.  See Richardson v. Perales, 402 U.S. 389, 408 (1971)\r\n(approving the use of medical advisors \"in complex cases for\r\nexplanation of medical problems in terms understandable to the\r\nlayman-examiner\").  Only after obtaining such information can\r\na decision regarding the extent of claimant's disability, if\r\nany, be made.\r\n           The judgment of the district court is vacated only in\r\nrelation to the carpal tunnel syndrome, and the matter is\r\nremanded with directions to remand to the Secretary for further\r\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.  In all other\r\nrespects, the judgment is affirmed.\n",
