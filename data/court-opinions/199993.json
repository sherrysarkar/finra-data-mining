Weathermark    Investments\n\n(\"Weathermark\"), operator of a home-heating oil business, appeals\n\nfrom   a   district         court    judgment      declaring     that   Utica   Mutual\nInsurance Company (\"Utica\") is under no contractual obligation to\n\nindemnify its insureds for costs incurred in cleaning up a fuel oil\n\nspill on Weathermark's property.                  Utica in turn cross-appeals from\na    district        court     ruling     entitling        Utica's      insureds    to\nindemnification for nonremediation \"property damages\" caused by the\n\noil contamination.           We affirm the district court judgment.\n\n                                              I\n\n                                       BACKGROUND\n\n              In 1994, Weathermark hired Hall Equipment, Inc. (\"Hall\"),\n\nto   repair    a     fuel    pump.      Due   to     allegedly    negligent     repairs\n\nperformed by Hall, more than 3,000 gallons of fuel oil spilled at\n\nthe Weathermark oil storage facility, some of which migrated to an\n\nadjacent property occupied by ELAW Corporation (\"ELAW\").                            The\n\nMassachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) issued\n\na notice of responsibility, requiring Weathermark to undertake\n\"immediate response actions.\"\n\n              In due course, Weathermark and ELAW brought a state court\n\naction against Hall and its president, William Riddell, for more\nthan $2 million in damages, including (i) their respective costs in\ncleaning up the oil spill; (ii) various permanent property damages\n\ndue to the spill; and (iii) loss of business income and profits.\nAs Weathermark and ELAW have settled their cross-claims and ELAW\n\n\n                                              3\n\fhas assigned its rights against Hall and Riddell to Weathermark, we\n\nadvert simply to Weathermark as the party demanding damages.\n\n          The Commercial General Liability (\"CGL\") policy issued by\nUtica insured Hall and Riddell against all \"sums that [they]\n\nbecome[] legally obligated to pay as damages because of 'bodily\n\ninjury' or 'property damage' to which this insurance applies,\"\nsubject, inter alia, to the following coverage exclusion:\n\n          (1)   \"Bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" arising\n                out of the actual, alleged or threatened\n                discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration,\n                release, or escape of pollutants . . . .\n\n          (2) [a]ny loss, cost or expense arising out of any:\n\n                (a)   Request, demand or order that any\n                      insured or others test for, monitor,\n                      clean up, remove, contain, treat,\n                      detoxify or neutralize, or in any\n                      way respond to, or assess the\n                      effects of pollutants; or\n\n                (b)   Claim or suit by or on behalf of a\n                      governmental authority for damages\n                      because of testing for, monitoring,\n                      cleaning up, removing, containing,\n                      treating,      detoxifying       or\n                      neutralizing,   or   in   any   way\n                      responding to, or assessing the\n                      effects of pollutants.\n\nCGL policy exclusion ¶ f.\n\n          Utica   commenced   the       instant   action   against   Hall,\n\nWeathermark, and ELAW in federal district court, demanding a\n\njudicial declaration that policy exclusion f(2), supra, rules out\n\nany contractual responsibility to indemnify Hall and Riddell for\n\n\n\n\n                                    4\n\fwhatever   damages    ultimately   may   be    due    Weathermark   in     the\n\nunderlying state-court actions.1\n\n           In due course, the district court entered partial summary\njudgment for Utica, declaring that ¶ f(2)(a) forecloses coverage of\n\nany cleanup costs for which Hall and Riddell are required to\n\nreimburse Weathermark and ELAW due to the oil spill, i.e., the so-\n\ncalled environmental \"response costs.\" Utica Mut. Ins. Co. v. Hall\n\nEquip., Inc., 73 F. Supp. 2d 83, 87 (D. Mass. 1999).            However, the\n\ndistrict court granted partial summary judgment for Hall as well,\n\nruling that ¶ f(2)(a) does not encompass \"nonremediation\" damages\n\nunrelated to Weathermark's actual removal of the spilled oil,\n\nincluding permanent damage to the Weathermark and ELAW properties\n\nand any diminution in their fair market value.         Id.   The respective\nparties cross-appealed from these district court rulings.\n\n                                    II\n\n                              DISCUSSION\n\n           Under      Massachusetts        law,        insurance-contract\ninterpretations pose legal issues for resolution by the court, and,\nabsent   ambiguity,   insurance    contracts    are   to   be   enforced   in\naccordance with their plain language.          See Somerset Sav. Bank v.\n\nChicago Title Ins. Co., 649 N.E.2d 1123, 1127 (Mass. 1995); Jacobs\n\nv. U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co., 627 N.E.2d 463, 464 (Mass. 1994)(\"[W]here\n\n\n\n     1\n      Although Utica's complaint also sought a judicial declaration\nas to whether its CGL policy obligated it to defend Hall and\nRiddell in the underlying state court proceedings, it no longer\npresses this claim.\n\n                                    5\n\fthe words of an insurance contract are 'plain and free from\n\nambiguity they must be construed in their usual and ordinary\n\nsense.'\")    (citation     omitted).       Moreover,    insurance-contract\ninterpretations rendered in the district court are subject to de\n\nnovo review.     See EKCO Group, Inc. v. Travelers Indem. Co., 273\n\nF.3d 409, 412 (1st Cir. 2001).         \"[I]insurance policies should be\nconstrued as a whole 'without according undue emphasis to any\n\nparticular part over another.'\" Mission Ins. Co. v. U.S. Fire Ins.\n\nCo., 517 N.E.2d 463, 466 (Mass. 1988)(citation omitted).               Only\n\nwhere a contractual term is ambiguous does its interpretation pose\n\na question of fact, and though the parties may adduce extrinsic\n\nevidence of their respective intendments, any residual ambiguity\n\nmust be resolved against the insurer.        See Preferred Mut. Ins. Co.\n\nv. Gamache, 686 NE.2d 989, 991 (Mass. 1997).           Most importantly in\n\nthe   present   context,   coverage    exclusions   are   to   be   strictly\n\nconstrued against the insurer. See id.\n\nA.    The Weathermark Appeal\n\n            The district court determined that, if successful, the\nstate-court claim Weathermark brought for reimbursement of its past\nand future response costs would constitute an \"expense arising out\n\nof a[] . . .[r]equest, demand or order that any insured or others\n. . . in any way respond to . . . the effects of pollutants,\"\nPolicy ¶ f(2)(a); and, consequently, that any recovery realized by\n\nWeathermark in its lawsuit would be excluded from coverage under\nthe CGL policy issued to Hall and Riddell.\n\n\n\n                                       6\n\f            Weathermark maintains on appeal that the district court\n\nerred in failing to infer the meaning of Policy ¶ f(2)(a) through\n\nreference to ¶ f(2)(b), which excludes from coverage \"[a]ny loss,\ncost or expense arising out of any . . . [c]laim or suit by or on\n\nbehalf of a governmental authority for damages because of testing\n\nfor, monitoring,    cleaning   up,   removing,        containing,   treating,\ndetoxifying or neutralizing, or in any responding to, or assessing\n\nthe effects of pollutants.\"     Adverting to the familiar maxim that\n\ngeneral contract language normally must yield to more particular\n\nlanguage,   Weathermark   contends       that   (i)   the   undefined   phrase\n\n\"[r]equest, demand or order,\" appearing in ¶ f(2)(a), is too\n\ngeneral to denote a lawsuit, and (ii) since ¶ f(2)(b) explicitly\n\naddresses the subject of lawsuits, Utica needed to specify in ¶\nf(2)(b) that both governmental and private-party lawsuits were to\n\nbe excluded from coverage.\n\n            The merits of these contentions need not be addressed,\nhowever, since Weathermark failed to raise them below, see Utica\n\nMut. Ins. Co., 73 F. Supp. 2d at 87-88, and issues first asserted\n\non appeal must be deemed waived, see Vanhaaren v. State Farm Mut.\n\nAuto. Ins. Co., 989 F.2d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1993).                     Instead,\n\nWeathermark merely invited the district court to compare ¶ f(2)(a)\n\nand ¶ f(1), rather than ¶ f(2)(a) and ¶ f(2)(b).                    Moreover,\n\nWeathermark subsequently abandoned the former comparison as a\n\nground for the instant appeal.2\n\n\n     2\n      Nor did the district court ruling constitute plain error.\nSee Ferrara & DiMercurio v. St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co., 240 F.3d 1,\n\n                                     7\n\f          Similarly, since the remaining arguments Weathermark\n\nasserts on appeal were never raised below, they are deemed waived.\n\nSee id. Weathermark now argues, on public policy grounds, that the\ninterpretation given ¶ f(2)(a) by the district court would enable\n\nUtica to exclude coverage based on the mere fortuity as to whether\n\nthe third party seeking reimbursement was served with a \"request,\"\nsuch as a notice of responsibility issued by an environmental\n\nenforcement   agency.   Weathermark   adds   that   its   theory   was\n\n\"apparently recognized\" in the memorandum submitted in support of\n\nUtica's motion for partial summary judgment.      Be that as it may,\n\nWeathermark presented no argumentation on this theory in opposition\n\nto Utica's motion for partial summary judgment.     Consequently, the\n\n\n\n13 (1st Cir. 2001) (waived issue may be reversed for plain error;\ni.e., only if it is egregious in nature and results in manifest\nmiscarriage of justice).      First, although \"[t]his pollution\nexclusion clause is uniformly used by the insurance industry in\ngeneral commercial liability policies,\" Byrd v. Blumenreich, 722\nA.2d 598, 600 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1999), Weathermark can\nunearth no case authority supporting its interpretation of ¶\nf(2)(a). While not necessarily conclusive, its failure to cite\nsuch authority does suggest that insureds generally have not\nadvocated the contract interpretation belatedly advanced on appeal\nby Weathermark.\n     Second, although arguably the Utica pollution exclusion clause\nmight have been more artfully drafted, we are required to\n\"interpret policy language in accordance with the common meaning of\nthe words used, from the viewpoint of a reasonable insured.\" Davis\nv. Allstate Ins. Co., 747 N.E.2d 141, 149 (Mass. 2001); Atl. Mut.\nIns. Co. v. McFadden, 595 N.E.2d 762, 764 (Mass. 1992).          In\nordinary usage, the term \"demand\" indicates an act of \"claim[ing]\nor seek[ing] as due by right.\" Webster's New Universal Unabridged\nDictionary 482 (2d ed.) (\"[I]n law, to summon to court.\"). Even in\nlegal parlance, the term \"demand\" is primarily defined as \"[t]he\nassertion of a legal right; a legal obligation asserted in the\ncourts.\"   Black's Law Dictionary 386 (5th ed. 1979) (emphasis\nadded).\n\n                                8\n\fdistrict court never reached it.3             The raise-or-waive rule serves\n\nto forfend against \"sand-bagging,\" viz., reserving legal theories\n\nfor initial use on appeal.\n            Finally, Weathermark maintains, were we to declare the\n\npollution   exclusion       ambiguous,       we   should   consider       \"extrinsic\n\nevidence\"   as   to   the    parties'    intent,     see,   e.g.,     1    Gibson   &\nMcLendon, Commercial Liability Insurance, Annotated Policy, at V.D.\n\n(1988), even though Weathermark concedes, as it must, that it never\n\nraised its \"extrinsic evidence\" argument below.                      Nonetheless,\n\nWeathermark urges, since appellate interpretations of insurance\n\ncontracts are plenary, see EKCO Group, Inc., 273 F.3d at 412, we\n\nshould allow it to advance any alternative argument on appeal.                      Of\n\ncourse, controlling authority is to the contrary:                   \"although the\ncourt of appeals affords de novo review to orders granting summary\n\njudgment, it will not reverse such an order on the basis of\n\narguments that were not made in the trial court.\"               Higgins v. New\n\nBalance Athletic Shoe, Inc., 194 F.3d 252, 258 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      Nor was there plain error. The district court ruled that\nWeathermark's state-court lawsuit constituted the \"request, demand,\nor order\" which triggered the ¶ f(2)(a) pollution exclusion. As\npreviously noted, Weathermark waived any appellate challenge to\nthat ruling. Accordingly, it is immaterial whether the notice of\nresponsibility which Weathermark received from the Massachusetts\nDepartment of Environmental Protection constituted a \"request,\ndemand, or order.\" See Smith v. Kmart Corp., 177 F.3d 19, 26 (1st\nCir. 1999) (on 'plain error\" review, appellant must meet its burden\nto establish that an alleged error was prejudicial).\n\n                                         9\n\fB.   The Utica Cross-Appeal\n\n           The district court determined that ¶ f(2)(a) neither\n\nencompasses the \"non-remediation\" damages incurred by Weathermark,\n\nnor any costs unrelated to actual removal of the spilled oil from\n\nthe Weathermark and ELAW properties, such as permanent property\n\ndamages, diminution in the fair market value of the properties, or\n\nlosses of rental or through-put income.                   Utica asserts in its\n\ncross-appeal that the district court erred in three respects.                     Its\n\nconclusions may be summarized as follows:\n\n            First,     these     nonremediation            damages     nonetheless\nconstituted a \"loss, cost or expense arising out of a[] . . .\n\ndemand . . . that [Hall] . . . in any way respond to . . . the\neffects of pollutants,\" since such nonremediation damages arose\nfrom the Weathermark lawsuit and would not have been incurred but\n\nfor the oil spill.         Second, the case law uniformly supports the\ncontract interpretation advanced by Utica.                      Third, ¶ f(2)(a)\nnotwithstanding,     the    diminution       in   the    fair   market   value    of\n\nproperty   and   the   loss     of    rental      or    through-put    income     are\nindependently    excluded      from   coverage         since   the   definition   of\n\"property damage\" contained in the CGL policy - viz., \"physical\n\ninjury to tangible property\" or \"loss of use of tangible property\"\nplainly does not encompass these types of intangible economic\nlosses.    We address these contentions in turn.\n\n            First, irresolvably ambiguous coverage exclusions are to\n\nbe strictly construed against the insurer. See Preferred Mut. Ins.\n\nCo., 686 N.E.2d at 991.         At first glance, the ¶ f(2)(a) phrases\n\n                                        10\n\fhere involved - \"in any way respond\" and \"effects of pollutants\" -\n\nappear to be fairly broad, arguably even encompassing all property\n\ndamages resulting from an oil spill.    Yet construing the insurance\npolicy as a whole, as required, see Mission Ins. Co., 517 N.E.2d at\n\n466, we agree with the district court that an insured reasonably\n\ncould construe the term \"respond\" as delimiting the scope of ¶\nf(2)(a) to recoveries of remediation costs.\n\n          Contrary to the contention advanced by Utica, the term\n\n\"demand,\" appearing in ¶ f(2)(a), does not necessarily contemplate\n\nthe entire lawsuit Weathermark filed in state court.                Rather,\n\n\"demand\" may simply refer to an individual claim asserted in a\n\nlawsuit; here, the claim for reimbursement of remediation costs.\n\nSee supra note 2.   When real property becomes contaminated by a\npollutant, two distinct types of damages frequently result. First,\n\nremediation damages obtain in the form of the expense incurred in\n\nthe containment and    removal   of   the   pollutant,   to   the    extent\npracticable, so as to return the property to its preexisting\n\nenvironmental condition.   Thus, in the parlance of environmental\nlaw, costs incurred in rehabilitating a contaminated property to\n\nits preexisting environmental condition typically are referred to\n\nas \"response costs.\"   See, e.g., Mass. Gen. Laws. Ann. ch. 21E, §\n\n4 (\"Response actions.\").   Accordingly, for example, normally the\n\nnotice of responsibility issued by the DEP would not additionally\n\ndemand that the remediating party remediate other property damage\n\ncaused by the contamination, unless it too posed an environmental\n\nthreat.   In the present case, even though the oil in situ itself\n\n\n                                 11\n\fconstituted \"property damage,\" see Hazen Paper Co. v. Fid. & Guar.\n\nCo., 555 N.E.2d 576, 583-84 (Mass. 1990), that is not to say that\n\nother consequential or incidental property damage may not have been\ncaused, which the mere removal of the spilled oil would not remedy.\n\n           Thus, by employing the term \"respond\" in ¶ f(2)(a), the\n\nUtica pollution exclusion gave rise to an ambiguity, particularly\nsince the preceding listing of activities pertained exclusively to\n\nremediation efforts - viz., testing or monitoring for, cleaning up,\n\nremoving, or containing the pollutant.          Compare Mass. Gen. Laws.\n\nAnn. ch. 21E, § 4 (\"Response actions.\"), with id. § 5(a)(iii)\n\n(making responsible parties liable \"to any person for damage to his\n\nreal or personal property incurred or suffered as a result of such\n\nrelease or threat of release\").\n           Further,   ¶   f(1)   specifically    excludes   from   coverage\n\n\"'property damage' arising out of the actual . . . discharge . . .\n\nof pollutants,\" yet lists only four circumstances in which the\nexclusion applies, none of which pertain to the insureds Hall and\n\nRiddell.   See Aldridge v. A.T. Cross Corp., 284 F.3d 72, 84 (1st\n\nCir. 2002) (court of appeals may affirm district court on any\n\nground apparent in record).          \"It is a well settled rule of\n\nconstruction for insurance policies that 'a specific provision\n\nrelating to a particular subject will govern in respect to that\n\nsubject, as against a general provision even though the latter,\n\nstanding alone, would be broad enough to include the subject to\n\nwhich the more specific provision relates.\" So.

Appleman & Jean Appleman, Insurance Law and\n\nPractice § 7357, at 181 (1979 & Supp. 2002).        Thus, even though the\n\nreference, in ¶ f(2)(a), to \"effects of pollutants\" - standing\n\nalone - may be exceedingly broad, the preceding specific reference\nto   \"property   damage\"    in   ¶   f(1)   supersedes   it,   rendering   it\n\nambiguous insofar as it may purport to encompass nonremediation\n\ndamages.    Moreover, had Utica so intended, it readily could have\n\nobviated any ambiguity.      See, e.g., Gaylord Container Corp. v. CNA\n\nIns. Cos., 807 So.2d 864, 870 (La. Ct. App. 2001) (adding final\n\nsentence to ¶ f(2)(a)-like pollution exclusion: \"To the extent that\n\nany of the above is determined to be . . . 'Property Damage,' said\n. . . 'Property Damages' [are] also excluded.\"].\n\n            Second, the unreported cases cited by Utica are either\n\ninapposite or unpersuasive.4         For instance, Manufacturers Gasket\n\nCo. v. Transcom, No. 93-3108 (6th Cir. Dec. 6, 1993), merely held\n\nthat the pollution exclusion barred coverage for a private lawsuit\n\nseeking to recover \"costs for pollutant cleanup.\"              The issue of\n\nnonremediation damages was never mentioned. In Coal Heat v. United\n\nStates Fidelity and Guaranty Co., 2000 WL 1680713 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 2,\n\n2000),     the   court     specifically      rejected    the   remediation-\n\n\n      4\n      Normally, unpublished opinions are not to be cited. See 1st\nCir. Local R. 36.2(b)(2)(F); United States v. Meade, 110 F.3d 190,\n202 (1st Cir. 1997). Here, however, we do not cite unpublished\nopinions as authority. Rather, we mention these opinions merely to\ndemonstrate that they would not aid Utica's cause, even assuming\nthey had some precedential effect, which they do not.\n\n                                      13\n\fnonremediation distinction drawn in Utica Mutual Ins. Co. v. Hall\n\nEquipment,. Inc., 73 F. Supp. 2d 83 (D. Mass. 1999), citing cases\n\nfrom other jurisdictions in which the courts \"[broadly] interpreted\nthe phrase 'arising out of' in the Pollution Exclusion to indicate\n\na 'but for' or 'causal' relationship between the damage claimed and\n\nthe released pollutants.\"          Id. at *7.     Nevertheless, the phrase\n\"arising out of\" does not modify \"effects of pollutants,\" but\n\npurports simply to require some causal connection between the\n\n\"loss\" and the \"demand.\"       As already noted, exclusion ¶ f(2)(a)\n\ndoes not use the term \"suit,\" and although a suit may be a\n\n\"demand,\" the term \"demand\" does not necessarily comprehend a\n\nlawsuit, but instead may simply refer to a claim asserted in a\n\nlawsuit. See supra note 2. Accordingly, the underlying premise in\nCoal Heat is flawed, since \"demands\" for remediation costs are\n\nsegregable from demands for nonremediation property damages.\n\n             Finally, we need not address the Utica contention that\nsome   of    these   nonremediation    damages     are   excludible    on     the\n\nindependent ground that the \"property damage\" definition contained\nin   the    insurance   contract   does    not   encompass   these    types   of\n\nintangible economic losses.          Nowhere in its motion for partial\n\nsummary judgment did Utica urge this \"separate and independent\n\nground\" for excluding coverage for this particular subset of\n\nnonremediation damages.       Accordingly, its argument must be deemed\n\nwaived.     See Vanhaaren, 989 F.2d at 4-5.\n\n             Since ¶ f(2)(a) is ambiguous as concerns any exclusion of\n\nnonremediation property damages, it is to be construed against the\n\n\n                                      14\n\finsurer which drafted the policy.

Utica in turn cross-appeals from a district court ruling entitling Utica's insureds to indemnification for nonremediation \"property damages\" caused by the oil contamination.

(\"Hall\"), to repair a fuel pump. Due to allegedly negligent repairs performed by Hall, more than 3,000 gallons of fuel oil spilled at the Weathermark oil storage facility, some of which migrated to an adjacent property occupied by ELAW Corporation (\"ELAW\"). The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) issued a notice of responsibility, requiring Weathermark to undertake \"immediate response actions.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, Weathermark and ELAW brought a state court action against Hall and its president, William Riddell, for more than $2 million in damages, including (i) their respective costs in cleaning up the oil spill; (ii) various permanent property damages due to the spill; and (iii) loss of business income and profits. As Weathermark and ELAW have settled their cross-claims and ELAW has assigned its rights against Hall and Riddell to Weathermark, we advert simply to Weathermark as the party demanding damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commercial General Liability (\"CGL\") policy issued by Utica insured Hall and Riddell against all \"sums that [they] become[] legally obligated to pay as damages because of `bodily injury' or `property damage' to which this insurance applies,\" subject, <i>inter alia,</i> to the following coverage <i>exclusion:</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) \"Bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" arising out of the actual, alleged or threatened discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release, or escape of pollutants....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) [a]ny loss, cost or expense arising out of any:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) Request, demand or order that any insured or others test for, monitor, clean up, remove, contain, treat, detoxify or neutralize, or in any way respond to, or assess the effects of pollutants; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) Claim or suit by or on behalf of a governmental authority for damages because of testing for, monitoring, cleaning up, removing, containing, treating, detoxifying or neutralizing, or in any way responding to, or assessing the effects of pollutants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CGL policy exclusion &#182; f.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Utica commenced the instant action against Hall, Weathermark, and ELAW in federal district court, demanding a judicial declaration that policy exclusion f(2), <i>supra,</i> rules out any contractual responsibility to indemnify Hall and Riddell for whatever damages ultimately may be due Weathermark in the underlying state-court actions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, the district court entered partial summary judgment for Utica, declaring that &#182; f(2)(a) forecloses coverage of any cleanup costs for which Hall and Riddell are required to reimburse Weathermark and ELAW due to the oil spill, <i>i.e.,</i> the so-called environmental \"response costs.\" <i>Utica Mut. Ins. Co. v. Hall Equip., Inc.,</i> 73 F.Supp.2d 83, 87 (D.Mass. 1999). However, the district court granted partial summary judgment for Hall as well, ruling that &#182; f(2)(a) does not encompass \"nonremediation\" damages unrelated to Weathermark's actual removal of the spilled oil, including permanent damage to the Weathermark and ELAW properties and any diminution in their fair market value. <i>Id.</i> The respective parties cross-appealed from these district court rulings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>DISCUSSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Massachusetts law, insurance-contract interpretations pose legal issues for resolution by the court, and, absent ambiguity, insurance contracts are to be enforced in accordance with their plain language. <i>See Somerset Savs. Bank v. Chicago Title Ins. Co.,</i> 420 Mass. 422, 649 N.E.2d 1123, 1127 (1995); <i>Jacobs v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co.,</i> 417 Mass. 75, 627 N.E.2d 463, 464 (1994)(\"[W]here the words of an insurance contract are `plain and free from ambiguity they must be construed in their usual and ordinary sense.'\") (citation omitted). Moreover, insurance-contract interpretations rendered in the district court are subject to <i>de novo</i> review. <i>See Ekco Group, Inc. v. Travelers Indem. Co.,</i> 273 F.3d 409, 412 (1st Cir.2001). \"[I]nsurance policies should be construed as a whole `without according undue emphasis to any particular part over another.'\" <i>Mission Ins. Co. v. U.S. Fire Ins. Co.,</i> 401 Mass. 492, 517 N.E.2d 463, 466 (1988) (citation omitted). Only where a contractual term is ambiguous does its interpretation pose a question of fact, and though the parties may adduce extrinsic evidence of their respective intendments, any residual ambiguity must be resolved against the insurer. <i>See Preferred Mut. Ins. Co. v. Gamache,</i> 426 Mass. 93, 686 N.E.2d 989, 991 (1997). Most importantly in the present context, coverage exclusions are to be strictly construed against the insurer. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Weathermark Appeal</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court determined that, if successful, the state-court claim Weathermark brought for reimbursement of its past and future response costs would constitute an \"expense arising out of a[] ... [r]equest, demand or order that any insured or others ... in any way respond to... the effects of pollutants,\" Policy &#182; f(2)(a); and, consequently, that any recovery realized by Weathermark in its lawsuit would be excluded from coverage under the CGL policy issued to Hall and Riddell.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weathermark maintains on appeal that the district court erred in failing to infer the meaning of Policy &#182; f(2)(a) through reference to &#182; f(2)(b), which excludes from coverage \"[a]ny loss, cost or expense arising out of any ... <i>[c]laim or suit</i> by or on behalf of a governmental authority for damages because of testing for, monitoring, cleaning up, removing, containing, treating, detoxifying or neutralizing, or in any responding to, or assessing the effects of pollutants.\" Adverting to the familiar maxim that general contract language normally must yield to more particular language, Weathermark contends that (i) the undefined phrase \"[r]equest, demand or order,\" appearing in &#182; f(2)(a), is too general to denote a lawsuit, and (ii) since &#182; f(2)(b) explicitly addresses the subject of lawsuits, Utica needed to specify in &#182; f(2)(b) that both governmental <i>and private-party</i> lawsuits were to be excluded from coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The merits of these contentions need not be addressed, however, since Weathermark failed to raise them below, <i>see Utica Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> 73 F.Supp.2d at 87-88, and issues first asserted on appeal must be deemed waived, <i>see VanHaaren v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.,</i> 989 F.2d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir.1993). Instead, Weathermark merely invited the district court to compare &#182; f(2)(a) <i>and</i> &#182; <i>f(1),</i> rather than &#182; f(2)(a) and &#182; f(2)(b). Moreover, Weathermark subsequently abandoned the former comparison as a ground for the instant appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, since the remaining arguments Weathermark asserts on appeal were never raised below, they are deemed waived. <i>See id.</i> Weathermark now argues, on public policy grounds, that the interpretation given &#182; f(2)(a) by the district court would enable Utica to exclude coverage based on the mere fortuity as to whether the third party seeking reimbursement was served with a \"request,\" such as a notice of responsibility issued by an environmental enforcement agency. Weathermark adds that its theory was \"apparently recognized\" in the memorandum submitted in support of Utica's motion for partial summary judgment. Be that as it may, Weathermark presented no argumentation on this theory in opposition to Utica's motion for partial summary judgment. Consequently, the district court never reached it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The raise-or-waive rule serves to forfend against \"sand-bagging,\" <i>viz.,</i> reserving legal theories for initial use on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Weathermark maintains, were we to declare the pollution exclusion ambiguous, we should consider \"extrinsic evidence\" as to the parties' intent, <i>see, e.g.,</i> 1 Gibson &amp; McLendon, <i>Commercial Liability Insurance,</i> Annotated Policy, at V.D. (1988), even though Weathermark concedes, as it must, that it never raised its \"extrinsic evidence\" argument below. Nonetheless, Weathermark urges, since appellate interpretations of insurance contracts are plenary, <i>see Ekco Group, Inc.,</i> 273 F.3d at 412, we should allow it to advance any alternative argument on appeal. Of course, controlling authority is to the contrary: \"although the court of appeals affords de novo review to orders granting summary judgment, it will not reverse such an order on the basis of arguments that were not made in the trial court.\" <i>Higgins v. New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc.,</i> 194 F.3d 252, 258 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The Utica Cross-Appeal</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court determined that &#182; f(2)(a) neither encompasses the \"non-remediation\" damages incurred by Weathermark, nor any costs unrelated to actual removal of the spilled oil from the Weathermark and ELAW properties, such as permanent property damages, diminution in the fair market value of the properties, or losses of rental or through-put income. Utica asserts in its cross-appeal that the district court erred in three respects. Its conclusions may be summarized as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, these nonremediation damages nonetheless constituted a \"loss, cost or expense arising out of a[] ... demand ... that [Hall] ... in any way respond to ... the effects of pollutants,\" since such nonremediation damages arose from the Weathermark lawsuit and would not have been incurred <i>but for</i> the oil spill. Second, the case law uniformly supports the contract interpretation advanced by Utica. Third, &#182; f(2)(a) notwithstanding, the diminution in the fair market value of property and the loss of rental or through-put income are independently excluded from coverage since the definition of \"property damage\" contained in the CGL policy &#8212; <i>viz.,</i> \"physical injury to tangible property\" or \"loss of use of tangible property\" plainly does not encompass these types of intangible economic losses. We address these contentions in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, irresolvably ambiguous <i>coverage exclusions</i> are to be strictly construed against the insurer. <i>See Preferred Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> 686 N.E.2d at 991. At first glance, the &#182; f(2)(a) phrases here involved &#8212; \"in any way respond\" and \"effects of pollutants\" &#8212; appear to be fairly broad, arguably even encompassing <i>all</i> property damages resulting from an oil spill. Yet construing the insurance policy as a whole, as required, <i>see Mission Ins. Co.,</i> 517 N.E.2d at 466, we agree with the district court that an insured reasonably could construe the term \"respond\" as delimiting the scope of &#182; f(2)(a) to recoveries of remediation costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to the contention advanced by Utica, the term \"demand,\" appearing in &#182; f(2)(a), does not necessarily contemplate the <i>entire</i> lawsuit Weathermark filed in state court. Rather, \"demand\" may simply refer to <i>an individual claim</i> asserted in a lawsuit; here, the claim for reimbursement of remediation costs. <i>See supra</i> note 2. When real property becomes contaminated by a pollutant, two distinct types of damages frequently result. First, remediation damages obtain in the form of the expense incurred in the <i>containment and removal of the pollutant,</i> to the extent practicable, so as to return the property to its preexisting environmental condition. Thus, in the parlance of environmental law, costs incurred in rehabilitating a contaminated property to its preexisting environmental condition typically are referred to as \"<i>response</i> costs.\" <i>See, e.g.,</i> Mass. Gen. Laws. Ann. ch. 21E, &#167; 4 (\"Response actions.\"). Accordingly, for example, normally the notice of responsibility issued by the DEP would not additionally demand that the remediating party remediate other property damage caused by the contamination, unless it too posed an environmental threat. In the present case, even though the oil <i>in situ</i> itself constituted \"property damage,\" <i>see Hazen Paper Co. v. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co.,</i> 407 Mass. 689, 555 N.E.2d 576, 583-84 (1990), that is not to say that other consequential or incidental property damage may not have been caused, which the mere removal of the spilled oil would not remedy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, by employing the term \"respond\" in &#182; f(2)(a), the Utica pollution exclusion gave rise to an ambiguity, particularly since the preceding listing of activities pertained exclusively to remediation efforts &#8212; <i>viz.,</i> testing or monitoring for, cleaning up, removing, or containing the pollutant. <i>Compare</i> Mass. Gen. Laws. Ann. ch. 21E, &#167; 4 (\"Response actions.\"), <i>with id.</i> &#167; 5(a)(iii) (making responsible parties liable \"to any person for damage to his real or personal property incurred or suffered as a result of such release or threat of release\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, &#182; f(1) specifically excludes from coverage \"`<i>property damage</i>' arising out of the actual ... discharge ... of pollutants,\" yet lists only four circumstances in which the exclusion applies, none of which pertain to the insureds Hall and Riddell. <i>See Aldridge v. A.T. Cross Corp.,</i> 284 F.3d 72, 84 (1st Cir.2002) (court of appeals may affirm district court on any ground apparent in record). \"It is a well settled rule of construction for insurance policies that `a specific provision relating to a particular subject will govern in respect to that subject, as against a general provision even though the latter, standing alone, would be broad enough to include the subject to which the more specific provision relates.\" <i>So. Cal. Edison Co. v. Harbor Ins. Co.,</i> 148 Cal.Rptr. 106, 112, 83 Cal.App.3d 747, 759 (1978) (citation omitted); <i>see also Transamerica Leasing, Inc. v. Inst. of London Underwriters,</i> 267 F.3d 1303, 1308 (11th Cir.2001); 13 John A. Appleman &amp; Jean Appleman, <i>Insurance Law and Practice</i> &#167; 7357, at 181 (1979 &amp; Supp.2002). Thus, even though the reference, in &#182; f(2)(a), to \"effects of pollutants\" &#8212; standing alone &#8212; may be exceedingly broad, the preceding specific reference to \"property damage\" in &#182; f(1) supersedes it, rendering it ambiguous insofar as it may purport to encompass nonremediation damages. Moreover, had Utica so intended, it readily could have obviated any ambiguity. <i>See, e.g., Gaylord Container Corp. v. CNA Ins. Cos.,</i> 807 So.2d 864, 870 (La.Ct.App.2001) (adding final sentence to &#182; f(2)(a)-like pollution exclusion: \"To the extent that any of the above is determined to be ... `Property Damage', said ... `Property Damages' [are] also excluded.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the unreported cases cited by Utica are either inapposite or unpersuasive.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> For instance, <i>Manufacturers Gasket Co. v. Transcon.,</i> No. 93-3108 (6th Cir. Dec.6, 1993), merely held that the pollution exclusion barred coverage for a private lawsuit seeking to recover \"costs for pollutant <i>cleanup.</i>\" The issue of nonremediation damages was never mentioned. In <i>Coal Heat v. United States Fidelity and Guaranty Co.,</i> 2000 WL 1689713 (E.D.Pa. Nov. 2, 2000), the court specifically rejected the remediation-nonremediation distinction drawn in <i>Utica Mutual Ins. Co. v. Hall Equipment, Inc.,</i> 73 F.Supp.2d 83 (D.Mass.1999), citing cases from other jurisdictions in which the courts \"[broadly] interpreted the phrase `arising out of' in the Pollution Exclusion to indicate a `but for' or `causal' relationship between the damage claimed and the released pollutants.\" <i>Id.</i> at *7. Nevertheless, the phrase \"arising out of\" does not modify \"effects of pollutants,\" but purports simply to require some causal connection between the \"loss\" <i>and the</i> \"<i>demand.</i>\" As already noted, exclusion &#182; f(2)(a) does not use the term \"suit,\" and although a suit may be a \"demand,\" the term \"demand\" does not necessarily comprehend a lawsuit, but instead may simply refer to <i>a</i> claim asserted in a lawsuit. <i>See supra</i> note 2.

Nowhere in its motion for partial summary judgment did Utica urge this \"separate and independent ground\" for excluding coverage for this particular subset of nonremediation damages.

Most importantly in the present context, coverage exclusions are to be strictly construed against the insurer. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Weathermark Appeal</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court determined that, if successful, the state-court claim Weathermark brought for reimbursement of its past and future response costs would constitute an \"expense arising out of a[] ... [r]equest, demand or order that any insured or others ... in any way respond to... the effects of pollutants,\" Policy &#182; f(2)(a); and, consequently, that any recovery realized by Weathermark in its lawsuit would be excluded from coverage under the CGL policy issued to Hall and Riddell.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weathermark maintains on appeal that the district court erred in failing to infer the meaning of Policy &#182; f(2)(a) through reference to &#182; f(2)(b), which excludes from coverage \"[a]ny loss, cost or expense arising out of any ... <i>[c]laim or suit</i> by or on behalf of a governmental authority for damages because of testing for, monitoring, cleaning up, removing, containing, treating, detoxifying or neutralizing, or in any responding to, or assessing the effects of pollutants.\" Adverting to the familiar maxim that general contract language normally must yield to more particular language, Weathermark contends that (i) the undefined phrase \"[r]equest, demand or order,\" appearing in &#182; f(2)(a), is too general to denote a lawsuit, and (ii) since &#182; f(2)(b) explicitly addresses the subject of lawsuits, Utica needed to specify in &#182; f(2)(b) that both governmental <i>and private-party</i> lawsuits were to be excluded from coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The merits of these contentions need not be addressed, however, since Weathermark failed to raise them below, <i>see Utica Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> 73 F.Supp.2d at 87-88, and issues first asserted on appeal must be deemed waived, <i>see VanHaaren v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.

Instead, Weathermark merely invited the district court to compare &#182; f(2)(a) <i>and</i> &#182; <i>f(1),</i> rather than &#182; f(2)(a) and &#182; f(2)(b). Moreover, Weathermark subsequently abandoned the former comparison as a ground for the instant appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, since the remaining arguments Weathermark asserts on appeal were never raised below, they are deemed waived. <i>See id.</i> Weathermark now argues, on public policy grounds, that the interpretation given &#182; f(2)(a) by the district court would enable Utica to exclude coverage based on the mere fortuity as to whether the third party seeking reimbursement was served with a \"request,\" such as a notice of responsibility issued by an environmental enforcement agency. Weathermark adds that its theory was \"apparently recognized\" in the memorandum submitted in support of Utica's motion for partial summary judgment. Be that as it may, Weathermark presented no argumentation on this theory in opposition to Utica's motion for partial summary judgment. Consequently, the district court never reached it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The raise-or-waive rule serves to forfend against \"sand-bagging,\" <i>viz.,</i> reserving legal theories for initial use on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Weathermark maintains, were we to declare the pollution exclusion ambiguous, we should consider \"extrinsic evidence\" as to the parties' intent, <i>see, e.g.,</i> 1 Gibson &amp; McLendon, <i>Commercial Liability Insurance,</i> Annotated Policy, at V.D. (1988), even though Weathermark concedes, as it must, that it never raised its \"extrinsic evidence\" argument below. Nonetheless, Weathermark urges, since appellate interpretations of insurance contracts are plenary, <i>see Ekco Group, Inc.,</i> 273 F.3d at 412, we should allow it to advance any alternative argument on appeal. Of course, controlling authority is to the contrary: \"although the court of appeals affords de novo review to orders granting summary judgment, it will not reverse such an order on the basis of arguments that were not made in the trial court.\" <i>Higgins v. New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198690\"><a href=\"/opinion/198690/higgins-v-new-balance/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span>, 258 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The Utica Cross-Appeal</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court determined that &#182; f(2)(a) neither encompasses the \"non-remediation\" damages incurred by Weathermark, nor any costs unrelated to actual removal of the spilled oil from the Weathermark and ELAW properties, such as permanent property damages, diminution in the fair market value of the properties, or losses of rental or through-put income. Utica asserts in its cross-appeal that the district court erred in three respects. Its conclusions may be summarized as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, these nonremediation damages nonetheless constituted a \"loss, cost or expense arising out of a[] ... demand ... that [Hall] ... in any way respond to ... the effects of pollutants,\" since such nonremediation damages arose from the Weathermark lawsuit and would not have been incurred <i>but for</i> the oil spill. Second, the case law uniformly supports the contract interpretation advanced by Utica. Third, &#182; f(2)(a) notwithstanding, the diminution in the fair market value of property and the loss of rental or through-put income are independently excluded from coverage since the definition of \"property damage\" contained in the CGL policy &#8212; <i>viz.,</i> \"physical injury to tangible property\" or \"loss of use of tangible property\" plainly does not encompass these types of intangible economic losses. We address these contentions in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, irresolvably ambiguous <i>coverage exclusions</i> are to be strictly construed against the insurer. <i>See Preferred Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> 686 N.E.2d at 991. At first glance, the &#182; f(2)(a) phrases here involved &#8212; \"in any way respond\" and \"effects of pollutants\" &#8212; appear to be fairly broad, arguably even encompassing <i>all</i> property damages resulting from an oil spill. Yet construing the insurance policy as a whole, as required, <i>see Mission Ins. Co.,</i> 517 N.E.2d at 466, we agree with the district court that an insured reasonably could construe the term \"respond\" as delimiting the scope of &#182; f(2)(a) to recoveries of remediation costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to the contention advanced by Utica, the term \"demand,\" appearing in &#182; f(2)(a), does not necessarily contemplate the <i>entire</i> lawsuit Weathermark filed in state court. Rather, \"demand\" may simply refer to <i>an individual claim</i> asserted in a lawsuit; here, the claim for reimbursement of remediation costs. <i>See supra</i> note 2. When real property becomes contaminated by a pollutant, two distinct types of damages frequently result. First, remediation damages obtain in the form of the expense incurred in the <i>containment and removal of the pollutant,</i> to the extent practicable, so as to return the property to its preexisting environmental condition. Thus, in the parlance of environmental law, costs incurred in rehabilitating a contaminated property to its preexisting environmental condition typically are referred to as \"<i>response</i> costs.\" <i>See, e.g.,</i> Mass. Gen. Laws. Ann. ch. 21E, &#167; 4 (\"Response actions.\"). Accordingly, for example, normally the notice of responsibility issued by the DEP would not additionally demand that the remediating party remediate other property damage caused by the contamination, unless it too posed an environmental threat. In the present case, even though the oil <i>in situ</i> itself constituted \"property damage,\" <i>see Hazen Paper Co. v. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2088528\"><a href=\"/opinion/2088528/hazen-paper-co-v-united-states-fidelity-guar-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">689</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2088528\"><a href=\"/opinion/2088528/hazen-paper-co-v-united-states-fidelity-guar-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">555</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">576</span></a></span>, 583-84 (1990), that is not to say that other consequential or incidental property damage may not have been caused, which the mere removal of the spilled oil would not remedy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, by employing the term \"respond\" in &#182; f(2)(a), the Utica pollution exclusion gave rise to an ambiguity, particularly since the preceding listing of activities pertained exclusively to remediation efforts &#8212; <i>viz.,</i> testing or monitoring for, cleaning up, removing, or containing the pollutant. <i>Compare</i> Mass. Gen. Laws. Ann. ch. 21E, &#167; 4 (\"Response actions.\"), <i>with id.</i> &#167; 5(a)(iii) (making responsible parties liable \"to any person for damage to his real or personal property incurred or suffered as a result of such release or threat of release\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, &#182; f(1) specifically excludes from coverage \"`<i>property damage</i>' arising out of the actual ... discharge ... of pollutants,\" yet lists only four circumstances in which the exclusion applies, none of which pertain to the insureds Hall and Riddell. <i>See Aldridge v.

Appleman &amp; Jean Appleman, <i>Insurance Law and Practice</i> &#167; 7357, at 181 (1979 &amp; Supp.2002). Thus, even though the reference, in &#182; f(2)(a), to \"effects of pollutants\" &#8212; standing alone &#8212; may be exceedingly broad, the preceding specific reference to \"property damage\" in &#182; f(1) supersedes it, rendering it ambiguous insofar as it may purport to encompass nonremediation damages. Moreover, had Utica so intended, it readily could have obviated any ambiguity. <i>See, e.g., Gaylord Container Corp. v. CNA Ins. Cos.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1904064\"><a href=\"/opinion/1904064/gaylord-container-corporation-v-cna-ins-companies/\"><span class=\"volume\">807</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">864</span></a></span>, 870 (La.Ct.App.2001) (adding final sentence to &#182; f(2)(a)-like pollution exclusion: \"To the extent that any of the above is determined to be ... `Property Damage', said ... `Property Damages' [are] also excluded.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the unreported cases cited by Utica are either inapposite or unpersuasive.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> For instance, <i>Manufacturers Gasket Co. v. Transcon.,</i> No. 93-3108 (6th Cir. Dec.6, 1993), merely held that the pollution exclusion barred coverage for a private lawsuit seeking to recover \"costs for pollutant <i>cleanup.</i>\" The issue of nonremediation damages was never mentioned. In <i>Coal Heat v. United States Fidelity and Guaranty Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1689713</span></span> (E.D.Pa. Nov. 2, 2000), the court specifically rejected the remediation-nonremediation distinction drawn in <i>Utica Mutual Ins. Co. v. Hall Equipment, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2313574\"><a href=\"/opinion/2313574/utica-mut-ins-co-v-hall-equipment-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span> (D.Mass.1999), citing cases from other jurisdictions in which the courts \"[broadly] interpreted the phrase `arising out of' in the Pollution Exclusion to indicate a `but for' or `causal' relationship between the damage claimed and the released pollutants.\" <i>Id.</i> at *7. Nevertheless, the phrase \"arising out of\" does not modify \"effects of pollutants,\" but purports simply to require some causal connection between the \"loss\" <i>and the</i> \"<i>demand.</i>\" As already noted, exclusion &#182; f(2)(a) does not use the term \"suit,\" and although a suit may be a \"demand,\" the term \"demand\" does not necessarily comprehend a lawsuit, but instead may simply refer to <i>a</i> claim asserted in a lawsuit. <i>See supra</i> note 2. Accordingly, the underlying premise in <i>Coal Heat</i> is flawed, since \"demands\" for remediation costs are segregable from demands for nonremediation property damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we need not address the Utica contention that some of these nonremediation damages are excludible on the independent ground that the \"property damage\" definition contained in the insurance contract does not encompass these types of intangible economic losses. Nowhere in its motion for partial summary judgment did Utica urge this \"separate and independent ground\" for excluding coverage for this particular subset of nonremediation damages. Accordingly, its argument must be deemed waived. <i>See VanHaaren,</i> 989 F.2d at 4-5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since &#182; f(2)(a) is ambiguous as concerns any exclusion of nonremediation property damages, it is to be construed against the insurer which drafted the policy. <i>See Preferred Mut. Ins. Co.,</i> 686 N.E.2d at 991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.

First, although \"[t]his pollution exclusion clause is uniformly used by the insurance industry in general commercial liability policies,\" <i>Byrd v. Blumenreich,</i> 317 N.J.Super. 496, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1425311\"><a href=\"/opinion/1425311/byrd-ex-rel-byrd-v-blumenreich/\"><span class=\"volume\">722</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span>, 600 (Super.Ct.App. Div. 1999), Weathermark can unearth <i>no</i> case authority supporting its interpretation of &#182; f(2)(a). While not necessarily conclusive, its failure to cite such authority does suggest that insureds generally have not advocated the contract interpretation belatedly advanced on appeal by Weathermark.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Second, although arguably the Utica pollution exclusion clause might have been more artfully drafted, we are required to \"interpret policy language in accordance with the common meaning of the words used, from the viewpoint of a reasonable insured.\" <i>Davis v.

In ordinary usage, the term \"demand\" indicates an act of \"claim[ing] or seek[ing] as due by right.\" Webster's New Universal Unabridged Dictionary 482 (2d ed.) (\"[I]n law, to summon to court.\"). Even in legal parlance, the term \"demand\" is primarily defined as \"[t]he assertion of a legal right; a legal obligation <i>asserted in the courts.</i>\" Black's Law Dictionary 386 (5th ed.1979) (emphasis added).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Nor was there plain error. The district court ruled that Weathermark's state-court<i>lawsuit</i> constituted the \"request, demand, or order\" which triggered the &#182; f(2)(a) pollution exclusion. As previously noted, Weathermark waived any appellate challenge to that ruling. Accordingly, it is immaterial whether the notice of responsibility which Weathermark received from the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection constituted a \"request, demand, or order.\" <i>See Smith v.
