Jaarah Salifu  appeals a  decision of  the\r                           \r\n\nBoard of Immigration Appeals,  which affirmed an  immigration\r\n\njudge's denial of her petition for asylum  and withholding of\r\n\ndeportation.  8 U.S.C.    1158, 1253(h).  We affirm.\r\r\n\n     Salifu, a native of Ghana, attempted to enter the United\r\n\nStates through John F. Kennedy Airport in New York on July 1,\r\n\n1993.  The Immigration and Naturalization Service paroled her\r\n\ninto the United  States and began exclusion  proceedings.  At\r\n\nan exclusion  hearing on  November 9,  1993, Salifu  conceded\r\n\nexcludability but  petitioned for  asylum and withholding  of\r\n\ndeportation, alleging that she feared persecution in Ghana on\r\n\nthe basis  of her political opinion.  Evidentiary hearings on\r\n\nthe petition were held  before an immigration judge  on March\r\n\n30 and August 25, 1994.  \r\n\n     Salifu's asylum affidavit states that she was a regional\r\n\norganizing  secretary of  Ghana's New Patriotic  Party, which\r\n\nopposed the ruling junta in  an election on November 3, 1992.\r\n\nThe  next   day,  Salifu  participated  in   a  demonstration\r\n\nprotesting fraud  in the  election.   The demonstrators  were\r\n\ndispersed by  army  and police  officers,  and a  curfew  was\r\n\nimposed on the area.  On November 6, police officers arrested\r\n\nSalifu  at home  and  took  her to  a  police station.    The\r\n\naffidavit states  that  she was  held  for about  two  weeks,\r\n\nduring which  time she was  raped twice.  Salifu  claims that\r\n\nthe  officers told  her she  was  being held  because of  her\r\n\nparticipation in the demonstration.  \r\n\n     Salifu's affidavit states that a police officer told her\r\n\nthat she would  be transferred to Accra, Ghana's capital, and\r\n\nthat many prisoners sent there  never returned.  The  officer\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nagreed to help  Salifu escape and took her  home.  Her mother\r\n\nsuggested that  she go  to stay  with her  grandmother, which\r\n\nSalifu did.  \r\n\n     After  three months  with  her grandmother,  Salifu said\r\n\nthat she  decided to contact a  friend in Accra.   The friend\r\n\ntook  Salifu in  and promised  to  help her  escape from  the\r\n\ncountry.   The friend obtained  a passport for Salifu  in the\r\n\nname of  Marian Bigelow and  an airline ticket to  the United\r\n\nStates.  The friend also gave her an envelope containing some\r\n\nphotographs.    During  the  flight,  Salifu   destroyed  the\r\n\npassport, as her friend had instructed.\r\n\n     Salifu was  detained by an INS official  upon arrival in\r\n\nNew  York.   The official  searched her  bag and  removed the\r\n\nenvelope, which contained not only the photographs but also a\r\n\nhandwritten  letter.   Salifu claims  she did  not  write the\r\n\nletter, does not  recognize the handwriting, and  was unaware\r\n\nthat the  letter was  in her possession  until it  was found.\r\n\nThe letter narrates the  experience of a New  Patriotic Party\r\n\nactivist who  was  raped; the  details  are similar  in  some\r\n\nrespects, but  not in others,  to Salifu's statements  in her\r\n\nasylum affidavit.  \r\n\n     The  INS   official  then  interrogated  Salifu.     She\r\n\nrequested  an interpreter who spoke Twi, her native language,\r\n\nbut  no interpreter  was  available.    Salifu  attempted  to\r\n\nconverse  with the officer in English, although she maintains\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nher English was and remains very poor.  The INS officer wrote\r\n\nSalifu's  answers out in affidavit form, which Salifu signed.\r\n\nThis  \"airport affidavit\" was  admitted into evidence  at the\r\n\nhearing, as were the letter and photographs found in Salifu's\r\n\npossession and  a memorandum that  the INS officer  wrote \"to\r\n\nfile\" after interviewing Salifu.\r\n\n     The   immigration  judge   wrote   a  detailed   opinion\r\n\nconcluding  that Salifu's testimony  was not credible.   This\r\n\nconclusion was based on  Salifu's demeanor on the  stand, her\r\n\ninability   or  refusal  to   answer  simple  questions,  and\r\n\ninconsistencies  between  her  live  testimony,  the  airport\r\n\naffidavit, and  the affidavit filed in support  of her asylum\r\n\npetition.   The immigration  judge concluded that  Salifu not\r\n\ncarried her  burden of proving  that she had  a \"well-founded\r\n\nfear of  persecution\" on  account of  her political  opinion.\r\n\nAlvarez-Flores v.  INS, 909 F.2d  1, 3  (1st Cir. 1990).   On\r                                  \r\n\nappeal,  the  Board  of  Immigration  Appeals   affirmed  the\r\n\nimmigration judge's decision.\r\n\n     Salifu's argument on  appeal comprises an attack  on the\r\n\nfactfinder's credibility assessments, which must be upheld as\r\n\nlong as  they are \"reasonably grounded in  the record, viewed\r\n\nas a whole.\"   Cordero-Trejo v.  INS, 40  F.3d 482, 487  (1st\r                                                \r\n\nCir.  1994).   We think  that the  immigration judge  was not\r\n\nclearly  erroneous in concluding  that Salifu's testimony was\r\n\nnot convincing.  As the  judge noted, there were  \"sufficient\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\ninconsistencies  in the  testimony,  asylum application,  and\r\n\naffidavitalone to warrant a negative finding of credibility.\"\r\n\n     Salifu argues that the Board violated the policy of  our\r\n\ndecision  in Cordero-Trejo  v.  INS, 40  F.3d  482 (1st  Cir.\r                                               \r\n\n1994).   In Cordero-Trejo, we  reversed a  denial of  asylum,\r                                     \r\n\nnoting  that  the  immigration  judge's  adverse  credibility\r\n\nfindings were not based on  \"any perspectives offered by  the\r\n\nunique  vantage  point  of the  factfinder,  such  as witness\r\n\ndemeanor, conflicting or confused testimony, etc., from which\r\n\ncredibility is typically assessed.\"  Id. at 491.  Rather, the\r                                                    \r\n\nimmigration   judge   in    Cordero-Trejo   discredited   the\r                                                     \r\n\npetitioner's testimony with criticisms that we thought either\r\n\npatently  unreasonable  or  directly refuted  by  documentary\r\n\nevidence in the record.  Nothing like that occurred here.\r\n\n     Salifu makes a  related legal argument that her own lack\r\n\nof credibility does  not dispose of her claim that  she has a\r\n\nwell-founded fear  of  persecution.   Salifu quotes  language\r\n\nfrom Cordero-Trejo to  the effect that an  asylum applicant's\r                              \r\n\ntestimony must  be evaluated  in the  context of  documentary\r\n\nevidence of the  political situation in the  applicant's home\r\n\ncountry.   Salifu is right that such  information is relevant\r\n\nto  determine whether a  petitioner's fear of  persecution is\r\n\nobjectively \"well-founded.\"   But as a threshold  matter, the\r\n\nasylum  petitioner  must   prove  that  she  has   an  actual\r\n\nsubjective  fear of persecution.  INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480\r                                                                    \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nU.S. 421, 430-31 (1987).  The subjective element of an asylum\r\n\nclaim  must  be  \"established  via the  applicant's  credible\r                                                                         \r\n\ntestimony that his fear is genuine.\"  Cordero-Trejo, 40  F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\nat 491 (emphasis added).   In this regard a petitioner's lack\r\n\nof credibility can be dispositive, as it is here.\r\n\n     Salifu  argues  that  the  immigration  judge  erred  in\r\n\nadmitting   into   evidence   the  handwritten   letter   and\r\n\nphotographs seized  from her at  the airport, as well  as the\r\n\nINS  officer's \"memorandum to file.\"  Because the photographs\r\n\nand memorandum do not appreciably strengthen the case against\r\n\nSalifu, we believe their admission,  if at all erroneous, was\r\n\nharmless.    Rodriguez-Hernandez v.  Miranda-Velez,  132 F.3d\r                                                              \r\n\n848, 855 (1st Cir. 1998).\r\n\n     The  handwritten letter, on the other hand, was damaging\r\n\nto Salifu.  Salifu's sole objection below was that the letter\r\n\nwas irrelevant.  This objection is without merit.  The letter\r\n\ntended  somewhat to  increase  the  chance  that  Salifu  was\r\n\n\"coached in her  story\" before  leaving Ghana,  and that  the\r\n\nstory was  untrue in  material respects.   On appeal,  Salifu\r\n\nasserts   that  there  was  no  foundation  for  the  letter,\r\n\nspecifically,  that there was  no independent proof  that the\r\n\nletter offered was  the one found in her  possession and that\r\n\nit had  not been  altered.  However,  this objection  was not\r\n\nmade at the time  the letter was offered into evidence, so it\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\nis deemed waived.  United States v. Benavente-Gomez, 921 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n378, 385 (1st Cir. 1990).\r\n\n     Salifu makes other  arguments regarding the  definitions\r\n\nof  persecution and  political opinion.    Because the  Board\r\n\ncorrectly   affirmed  the   immigration  judge's   conclusion\r\n\nregarding credibility,  we do  not reach Salifu's  additional\r\n\neligibility  arguments.   Because she  does  not qualify  for\r\n\nasylum, Salifu also does not meet the more demanding standard\r\n\nfor  withholding of deportation.

The  officer\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nagreed to help  Salifu escape and took her  home.  Her mother\r\n\nsuggested that  she go  to stay  with her  grandmother, which\r\n\nSalifu did.  \r\n\n     After  three months  with  her grandmother,  Salifu said\r\n\nthat she  decided to contact a  friend in Accra.   The friend\r\n\ntook  Salifu in  and promised  to  help her  escape from  the\r\n\ncountry.   The friend obtained  a passport for Salifu  in the\r\n\nname of  Marian Bigelow and  an airline ticket to  the United\r\n\nStates.  The friend also gave her an envelope containing some\r\n\nphotographs.    During  the  flight,  Salifu   destroyed  the\r\n\npassport, as her friend had instructed.\r\n\n     Salifu was  detained by an INS official  upon arrival in\r\n\nNew  York.   The official  searched her  bag and  removed the\r\n\nenvelope, which contained not only the photographs but also a\r\n\nhandwritten  letter.   Salifu claims  she did  not  write the\r\n\nletter, does not  recognize the handwriting, and  was unaware\r\n\nthat the  letter was  in her possession  until it  was found.\r\n\nThe letter narrates the  experience of a New  Patriotic Party\r\n\nactivist who  was  raped; the  details  are similar  in  some\r\n\nrespects, but  not in others,  to Salifu's statements  in her\r\n\nasylum affidavit.  \r\n\n     The  INS   official  then  interrogated  Salifu.     She\r\n\nrequested  an interpreter who spoke Twi, her native language,\r\n\nbut  no interpreter  was  available.    Salifu  attempted  to\r\n\nconverse  with the officer in English, although she maintains\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nher English was and remains very poor.  The INS officer wrote\r\n\nSalifu's  answers out in affidavit form, which Salifu signed.\r\n\nThis  \"airport affidavit\" was  admitted into evidence  at the\r\n\nhearing, as were the letter and photographs found in Salifu's\r\n\npossession and  a memorandum that  the INS officer  wrote \"to\r\n\nfile\" after interviewing Salifu.\r\n\n     The   immigration  judge   wrote   a  detailed   opinion\r\n\nconcluding  that Salifu's testimony  was not credible.   This\r\n\nconclusion was based on  Salifu's demeanor on the  stand, her\r\n\ninability   or  refusal  to   answer  simple  questions,  and\r\n\ninconsistencies  between  her  live  testimony,  the  airport\r\n\naffidavit, and  the affidavit filed in support  of her asylum\r\n\npetition.   The immigration  judge concluded that  Salifu not\r\n\ncarried her  burden of proving  that she had  a \"well-founded\r\n\nfear of  persecution\" on  account of  her political  opinion.\r\n\nAlvarez-Flores v.

In Cordero-Trejo, we  reversed a  denial of  asylum,\r                                     \r\n\nnoting  that  the  immigration  judge's  adverse  credibility\r\n\nfindings were not based on  \"any perspectives offered by  the\r\n\nunique  vantage  point  of the  factfinder,  such  as witness\r\n\ndemeanor, conflicting or confused testimony, etc., from which\r\n\ncredibility is typically assessed.\"  Id. at 491.  Rather, the\r                                                    \r\n\nimmigration   judge   in    Cordero-Trejo   discredited   the\r                                                     \r\n\npetitioner's testimony with criticisms that we thought either\r\n\npatently  unreasonable  or  directly refuted  by  documentary\r\n\nevidence in the record.  Nothing like that occurred here.\r\n\n     Salifu makes a  related legal argument that her own lack\r\n\nof credibility does  not dispose of her claim that  she has a\r\n\nwell-founded fear  of  persecution.   Salifu quotes  language\r\n\nfrom Cordero-Trejo to  the effect that an  asylum applicant's\r                              \r\n\ntestimony must  be evaluated  in the  context of  documentary\r\n\nevidence of the  political situation in the  applicant's home\r\n\ncountry.   Salifu is right that such  information is relevant\r\n\nto  determine whether a  petitioner's fear of  persecution is\r\n\nobjectively \"well-founded.\"   But as a threshold  matter, the\r\n\nasylum  petitioner  must   prove  that  she  has   an  actual\r\n\nsubjective  fear of persecution.

In this regard a petitioner's lack\r\n\nof credibility can be dispositive, as it is here.\r\n\n     Salifu  argues  that  the  immigration  judge  erred  in\r\n\nadmitting   into   evidence   the  handwritten   letter   and\r\n\nphotographs seized  from her at  the airport, as well  as the\r\n\nINS  officer's \"memorandum to file.\"  Because the photographs\r\n\nand memorandum do not appreciably strengthen the case against\r\n\nSalifu, we believe their admission,  if at all erroneous, was\r\n\nharmless.

Salifu's sole objection below was that the letter\r\n\nwas irrelevant.  This objection is without merit.  The letter\r\n\ntended  somewhat to  increase  the  chance  that  Salifu  was\r\n\n\"coached in her  story\" before  leaving Ghana,  and that  the\r\n\nstory was  untrue in  material respects.   On appeal,  Salifu\r\n\nasserts   that  there  was  no  foundation  for  the  letter,\r\n\nspecifically,  that there was  no independent proof  that the\r\n\nletter offered was  the one found in her  possession and that\r\n\nit had  not been  altered.

Because the  Board\r\n\ncorrectly   affirmed  the   immigration  judge's   conclusion\r\n\nregarding credibility,  we do  not reach Salifu's  additional\r\n\neligibility  arguments.   Because she  does  not qualify  for\r\n\nasylum, Salifu also does not meet the more demanding standard\r\n\nfor  withholding of deportation.
