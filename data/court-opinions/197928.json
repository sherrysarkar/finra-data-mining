Lindsay, U.S. District Judge]\r\n                                      \r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                 Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n\n             Aldrich, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n               and Boudin, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n                                      \r\n\nBruce G. McNeill with whom Edward R. Wiest and Tarlow, Breed,\r\nHart, Murphy &amp; Rodgers, P.C. were on brief for appellant.\r\nStephen G. Howard with whom Law Office of Stephen G. Howardwas on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                    April 14, 1998\r\n\n                             BOUDIN, Circuit Judge. Alexandra Troy sued her former\r\nemployer, Bay State Computer Group, Inc., for gender discrimination\r\nand on other claims arising out of the loss of her job. \r\nEventually, a large judgment was entered in favor of Alexandra\r\nTroy, and Bay State now appeals.  The central questions are the\r\nsufficiency of the evidence in her favor and the effect to be given\r\na prior jury determination where a separate but overlapping claim\r\n          is thereafter tried to the judge.\r\n      Bay State is a company based in Charlestown,\r\nMassachusetts, that sells computer equipment and provides services\r\nfor computer networks.  On October 1, 1990, the company hired\r\nAlexandra Troy as a \"networking systems division administrator,\"\r\nprimarily to act as a go-between for customers requiring network\r\nservice and Bay State's field service engineers.  Her immediate\r\nsuperior--unrelated to her despite the common last name--was George\r\nTroy, the company's vice president of operations.  The first 90\r\n  days of the new job were a probationary period.  \r\n On November 6, 1990, Alexandra Troy's doctor told her\r\nthat she was pregnant and would require a brief hospitalization. \r\nWith George Troy's permission, Alexandra Troy was absent on\r\nNovember 7 and 8.  When she returned to work, George Troy asked her\r\nabout her plans, and she told him that she intended to work until\r\nthe baby was born and then take maternity leave and return to Bay\r\n                 State thereafter.  \r\n In early January 1991, George Troy told Alexandra Troy\r\nthat her work was satisfactory and that she was now a permanent\r\nemployee.  Later that month, he expanded her responsibilities,\r\ndesignating her \"administrator of operations.\"  In mid-February,\r\nAlexandra Troy was absent several days due to an illness unrelated\r\nto her pregnancy.  Shortly thereafter, complications related to her\r\npregnancy kept her out of the office for two additional days.  When\r\nshe returned to work on February 21, following her doctor's advice\r\nthat she could do so, George Troy told her that \"her body was\r\ntrying to tell her something\" and that \"her attendance was becoming\r\na serious problem.\"  George Troy suggested that she accept a\r\ndischarge from Bay State and collect unemployment benefits instead\r\n        of taking an unpaid maternity leave.  \r\nOn returning to work the next day, Alexandra Troy sought\r\nadvice from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and later\r\nin the day told George Troy that she was rejecting his suggestion\r\nand would continue working.  George Troy then told her that she was\r\ndischarged effective immediately.  When she told him that the EEOC\r\nhad advised that Bay State could not fire her, George Troy told her\r\nthat if necessary he would say that there was no need for her job. \r\nLater, Alexandra Troy applied to the state for unemployment\r\ncompensation, and Bay State advised the agency that she had been\r\n          laid off due to a lack of work.  \r\n In May 1991, Alexandra Troy filed a complaint with the\r\nMassachusetts Commission Against Discrimination and with the EEOC. \r\nIn response, Bay State said that Alexandra Troy had been terminated\r\nfor poor attendance.  After receiving the necessary clearance,\r\nAlexandra Troy brought the present suit against Bay State in state\r\ncourt, and Bay State removed the suit to federal district court. \r\nAlexandra Troy's complaint set forth a number of claims \r\nbut only one twinned claim concerns us on this appeal:  that her\r\ndischarge constituted gender discrimination in violation of Title\r\nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.  2000e et seq.,\r\nand of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B,  4.  After discovery, the state\r\nclaim under chapter 151B was tried to a jury in October 1995, while\r\nthe Title VII claim was reserved for later consideration by the\r\njudge.  The jury found for her on the state discrimination claim\r\nand awarded her $15,000 in back pay and $14,300 for emotional\r\ndistress. \r\nThe district court then asked the parties for proposed\r\nfindings and argument on the Title VII claim.  On July 15, 1996,\r\nthe district court entered a decision on the Title VII claim.  Like\r\nthe jury, the district court found that gender discrimination had\r\nbeen proved.  However, the district court found that a much larger\r\namount of back pay was due (just over $90,000), plus prejudgment\r\ninterest, and awarded almost as much in attorneys' fees and costs. \r\nAfter further adjustments, the court in March 1997 entered a new\r\nfinal judgment in the amount of $273,099.67.\r\nOn appeal, Bay State first argues that the evidence was\r\ninsufficient to support a verdict of gender discrimination.  It\r\nimplicitly concedes that to fire Alexandra Troy simply because she\r\nwas pregnant would constitute gender discrimination, assuming that\r\nshe remained qualified for her job.  But Bay State asserts that the\r\nevidence overwhelmingly showed that she was fired for poor\r\nattendance and that no factfinder could properly determine\r\notherwise.\r\nThe case is actually a close one, despite the terrible\r\nimpression that Bay State's conduct and statements must have made\r\nupon the jury.  The discrimination statutes are not medical leave\r\nacts, and Bay State would not automatically be liable for gender\r\ndiscrimination if it had discharged Alexandra Troy for poor\r\nattendance under standards applied to other employees, even if the\r\npoor record were due to pregnancy complications.  Cf. Evans v.\r\nFederal Express Corp., 133 F.3d 137, 140 (1st Cir. 1998).  But it\r\nwould be liable if poor attendance was a pretext and the actual\r\nreason was her pregnancy.  See St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509\r\nU.S. 502, 510-11 (1995).\r\nThe difficulty, of course, is that the two categories--\r\nher job conduct and her medical condition--are not wholly distinct. \r\nA plausible reading of the situation, not necessarily the only one,\r\nis that George Troy was concerned because Alexandra Troy was\r\npregnant and had already missed several days of work on that\r\naccount, and he believed that she was likely thereafter to have a\r\npoor attendance record.  Not only did he tell Alexandra Troy that\r\n\"her body was trying to tell her something,\" but he then repeated\r\nthe same statement to another official, adding that \"not working\r\nwas the best thing for [Alexandra Troy].\"\r\nBut George Troy knew (or the jury could have so found\r\nfrom the evidence) that Alexandra Troy's doctor had found no\r\ncontinuing problem incident to her two-day absence.  The jury could\r\nconclude from this that George Troy acted on little more than a\r\nstereotypical judgment that pregnant women are poor attendees. \r\nUnder the law, this kind of stereotyping amounts to gender\r\ndiscrimination:  the company could not discharge her simply for\r\nbeing pregnant on the speculation that she would probably be\r\nrendered unable to fulfill the requirements of the job.  Cf. Smithv. F.W. Morse &amp; Co., 76 F.3d 413, 420 (1st Cir. 1996); Macauley v.\r\nMassachusetts Comm'n Against Discrimination, 379 Mass. 279, 281\r\n(1979).\r\nThe jury was not obliged to accept George Troy's later\r\nexplanation that she had been fired for poor attendance.  Not only\r\nwere her absences limited in number, but George Troy had little\r\ncredibility.  According to Alexandra Troy, George Troy told her at\r\nthe time that she was discharged:  \"Alex, it doesn't pay to be\r\nhonest; if it comes right down to it, I will say there simply was\r\nno need for your job.\"  And while Alexandra Troy was an interested\r\nwitness, George Troy repeated his \"body trying to tell her\r\nsomething\" remark in a later discussion with another Bay State\r\nofficial.  The official (a woman) objected, and George Troy\r\nallegedly replied \"if I am ever asked, I will deny I ever said it.\"\r\nIn considering a claim of insufficient evidence, we take \r\nthe record in the light most favorable to the verdict.  Sinai v.\r\nNew Eng. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 3 F.3d 471, 472 (1st Cir. 1993), cert.\r\ndenied, 513 U.S. 1025 (1994).  What has already been said is enough\r\nto show that the jury was not irrational in concluding that\r\nstereotypes about pregnancy and not actual job attendance were the\r\ncause of the discharge, and that the company's other multiple\r\nexplanations were pretext.  Similarly, the district judge cannot be\r\ndeemed \"clearly erroneous\" for reaching the same conclusion,\r\nMcKinnon v. Kwong Wah Restaurant, 83 F.3d 498, 508 (1st Cir. 1996),\r\neven if the federal rules as to pretext may differ from the state's\r\nrules.\r\nBay State's other main challenge to the judgment is its\r\nclaim that the district judge could not award more back pay than\r\ndid the jury.  Alexandra Troy disputes that the issue was\r\npreserved, but we find that it was.  After the jury verdict and\r\nbefore the judge's own decision, Alexandra Troy made clear that she\r\nwas seeking a larger back pay award from the judge; Bay State\r\npromptly objected to this request on the ground that the jury\r\ndecision prevented it--and did so well before the district judge\r\nmade the larger award.\r\nThe jury's award was made under chapter 151B, and the\r\ndistrict court rested its larger award on Title VII.  But no one\r\nhas suggested that there was any pertinent difference in the\r\nstandards for measuring back pay; under both rubrics Alexandra Troy\r\nwas entitled to recover, although only once, for what she would\r\nhave earned absent the discharge, reduced by any compensation that\r\nshe actually received during the same period and any additional\r\namount that she would have received through reasonable efforts to\r\nmitigate her damages.  See 42 U.S.C.  2000e-5(g)(1); Conway v.\r\nElectro Switch Corp., 402 Mass. 385, 389 (1988).  \r\nThe jury did not explain its reasons for awarding only\r\n$15,000 as back pay but, given the arguments made to it at trial,\r\nthe jury may have thought Alexandra Troy did not do enough to\r\nmitigate damages; indeed, Bay State argued that it had offered to\r\ntake her back.  The district judge, by contrast, simply multiplied\r\nTroy's weekly salary at Bay State by the number of weeks she\r\nremained unemployed after her discharge prior to the date of the\r\ntrial and deducted periods of unpaid maternity leave.  He also\r\nallowed prejudgment interest.  \r\nPrejudgment interest aside, the difference in calculation\r\nin back pay turns on issues that are either strictly factual or\r\nfact-bound applications of general principles like mitigation.  It\r\nis not surprising that two different factfinders should view the\r\nmatter differently, and probably either outcome could be supported\r\non this record.  The question posed is whether the district judge\r\nwas bound to respect the jury's prior calculation of back pay.  \r\nThe problem arises because the state claim under chapter\r\n151B carries a Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial, seeGallagher v. Wilton Enter., Inc., 962 F.2d 120, 123-24 (1st Cir.\r\n1992), but at the time of trial in this case, Alexandra Troy's\r\npreexisting Title VII claim was still treated as an equitable one\r\nnot subject to the Seventh Amendment and triable to the judge.\r\nWhere there are overlapping claims, some triable to the judge and\r\nsome to the jury, the Supreme Court has instructed that the jury\r\nclaims be resolved first in order to protect the right to jury\r\ntrial.  Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500, 508-11\r\n(1959).\r\nIn setting this priority rule, the Supreme Court appeared\r\nto conclude that without it, earlier findings by the judge on\r\ncommon issues would bind the jury under some variant of collateral\r\nestoppel.  See Beacon Theatres, 359 U.S. at 503-04, 506-08. \r\nBuilding on this reference, it has become common, in this circuit\r\nas in others, to say that the judge is normally bound by earlier\r\njury findings in the same case on common issues.  See Combustion\r\nEng'g, Inc. v. Miller Hydro Group, 13 F.3d 437, 444 (1st Cir.\r\n1993); Lopez v. Garriga, 917 F.2d 63, 67 (1st Cir. 1990); 18\r\nWright, Miller &amp; Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure  4418, at\r\n174-75 &amp; n.22 (1981 &amp; Supp. 1997) collecting cases).  We agree\r\nwith Judge Posner that, although the rule \"might be questioned as\r\nan original matter,\" it is now well-established.  McKnight v.\r\nGeneral Motors Corp., 908 F.2d 104, 113 (7th Cir. 1990), cert.\r\ndenied, 499 U.S. 919 (1991).\r\nThe rule is beneficial in minimizing inconsistencies,\r\neven if the efficiencies in timesaving are not as great as with\r\ncollateral estoppel.  And the rule has a further benefit insofar as\r\nit avoids giving one side, but not the other, two bites at the sameapple:  if the judge retries damages, a plaintiff will\r\nautomatically get the larger of the two awards.  Of course, the\r\njudge can always set aside the jury verdict, large or small, if it\r\nis irrational; but no such attack on the jury award could be\r\nsustained in this case.\r\nIn our view, the presumptive rule is that the first\r\nfactfinder binds the second on factual issues actually litigated\r\nand necessary to the result.  This is not a constitutional rule,\r\nbut one of economy similar to collateral estoppel.  While that term\r\nusually refers to the binding effect of a prior final judgment, the\r\nunderlying objectives are similar, and the numerous exceptions to\r\ncollateral estoppel are probably good guides in cases like this\r\none.  See Restatement (Second), Judgments,  28 (1982).  However,\r\nnone of those exceptions, or any other, has been invoked in this\r\ncase.\r\nIf Congress directed in Title VII cases that the district\r\njudge ignore a prior jury finding, an exception to the presumptive\r\nrule of consistency would be warranted.  There is no such explicit\r\ndirective in Title VII, but perhaps an inference as to policy might\r\nbe drawn from legislative history, depending on why Title VII\r\nrelief was originally cast in equitable form.  But the 1991\r\namendment to Title VII (see note 2, above), regardless of its\r\ntechnical effective date, shows that Congress has no present policy\r\nobjection to jury findings in Title VII cases.  See Ballard\r\nShipping Co. v. Beach Shellfish, 32 F.3d 623, 631 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\nIn the present case, Alexandra Troy has not suggested any\r\nreason why, assuming the issue was properly preserved by Bay State,\r\nthe jury finding of back pay should not control the district judge\r\nunder what we hold to be the general rule.  Accordingly, we think\r\nthat the district court was obliged to accept the $15,000 figure as\r\nthe proper amount of back pay.  However, the decision to award pre-\r\njudgment interest is within the trial court's discretion, Hogan v.\r\nBangor &amp; Aroostook R. Co., 61 F.3d 1034, 1038 (1st Cir. 1995), and\r\nwe see no reason why awarding prejudgment interest on the back pay\r\naward as computed by the jury would not be appropriate.  \r\nBay State has also objected to the district court's\r\nfailure to deduct from its own back pay judgment the amount of\r\n$20,984, constituting income earned and employment compensation\r\ncollected by Alexandra Troy between the time she was fired by Bay\r\nState and the time she brought her lawsuit.  Alexandra Troy, in\r\nturn, argues that Bay State has waived this argument.  As far as we\r\ncan tell, the jury's back pay determination included reductions for\r\nany offsetting benefits obtained by Alexandra Troy, and the\r\nseparate figure determined by the district court is moot in light\r\nof our determination that the district judge was bound by the\r\njury's determination. \r\nFinally, Bay State argues that the district court abused\r\nits discretion by awarding Alexandra Troy the full amount of\r\nattorneys' fees she requested.  Determining the fee award under\r\nTitle VII is committed to the \"particularly broad\" discretion of\r\nthe trial court.  Phetosomphone v. Allison Reed Group, Inc., 984\r\nF.2d 4, 6 (1st Cir. 1993).  But Bay State argues that the award of\r\nattorneys' fees and costs ($99,584.91) must be an abuse of\r\ndiscretion because it vastly exceeds the amount of damages to which\r\nAlexandra Troy is properly entitled ($29,300 plus interest on back\r\npay yet to be recomputed).\r\nOne element that a district court considers in awarding\r\nfees is the actual amount of compensatory damages recovered,\r\nalthough it may be \"only one of many factors.\"  City of Riversidev. Rivera, 477 U.S. 561, 574 (1986) (plurality opinion).  And in\r\nthis case, the district court's ruling on the fee application\r\nappeared to give weight to the very substantial Title VII award\r\nmade by the district court.  In these circumstances, we think it\r\nbest that the district judge make a fresh determination of the\r\naward of attorneys' fees in light of the greatly reduced back pay\r\naward that will be entered as part of the new final judgment.\r\nThe judgment is vacated and remanded for proceedings\r\nconsistent with this opinion.  Each side shall bear its own costs\r\non this appeal.\n",

The central questions are the\r\nsufficiency of the evidence in her favor and the effect to be given\r\na prior jury determination where a separate but overlapping claim\r\n          is thereafter tried to the judge.\r\n      Bay State is a company based in Charlestown,\r\nMassachusetts, that sells computer equipment and provides services\r\nfor computer networks.  On October 1, 1990, the company hired\r\nAlexandra Troy as a \"networking systems division administrator,\"\r\nprimarily to act as a go-between for customers requiring network\r\nservice and Bay State's field service engineers.

Evans v.\r\nFederal Express Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"750077\"><a href=\"/opinion/750077/michael-evans-v-federal-express-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 140 (1st Cir. 1998).  But it\r\nwould be liable if poor attendance was a pretext and the actual\r\nreason was her pregnancy.  See St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 510-11 (1995).\r\nThe difficulty, of course, is that the two categories--\r\nher job conduct and her medical condition--are not wholly distinct. \r\nA plausible reading of the situation, not necessarily the only one,\r\nis that George Troy was concerned because Alexandra Troy was\r\npregnant and had already missed several days of work on that\r\naccount, and he believed that she was likely thereafter to have a\r\npoor attendance record.  Not only did he tell Alexandra Troy that\r\n\"her body was trying to tell her something,\" but he then repeated\r\nthe same statement to another official, adding that \"not working\r\nwas the best thing for [Alexandra Troy].\"\r\nBut George Troy knew (or the jury could have so found\r\nfrom the evidence) that Alexandra Troy's doctor had found no\r\ncontinuing problem incident to her two-day absence.  The jury could\r\nconclude from this that George Troy acted on little more than a\r\nstereotypical judgment that pregnant women are poor attendees. \r\nUnder the law, this kind of stereotyping amounts to gender\r\ndiscrimination:  the company could not discharge her simply for\r\nbeing pregnant on the speculation that she would probably be\r\nrendered unable to fulfill the requirements of the job.  Cf. Smithv. F.W. Morse &amp; Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196571\"><a href=\"/opinion/196571/smith-v-fw-morse-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">413</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 420 (1st Cir. 1996); Macauley v.\r\nMassachusetts Comm'n Against Discrimination, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2218197\"><a href=\"/opinion/2218197/macauley-v-massachusetts-comm-against-discrimination/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 281\r\n(1979).\r\nThe jury was not obliged to accept George Troy's later\r\nexplanation that she had been fired for poor attendance.  Not only\r\nwere her absences limited in number, but George Troy had little\r\ncredibility.  According to Alexandra Troy, George Troy told her at\r\nthe time that she was discharged:  \"Alex, it doesn't pay to be\r\nhonest; if it comes right down to it, I will say there simply was\r\nno need for your job.\"  And while Alexandra Troy was an interested\r\nwitness, George Troy repeated his \"body trying to tell her\r\nsomething\" remark in a later discussion with another Bay State\r\nofficial.  The official (a woman) objected, and George Troy\r\nallegedly replied \"if I am ever asked, I will deny I ever said it.\"\r\nIn considering a claim of insufficient evidence, we take \r\nthe record in the light most favorable to the verdict.  Sinai v.\r\nNew Eng. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194886\"><a href=\"/opinion/194886/sinai-v-new-england/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 472 (1st Cir. 1993), cert.\r\ndenied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1025</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1994).  What has already been said is enough\r\nto show that the jury was not irrational in concluding that\r\nstereotypes about pregnancy and not actual job attendance were the\r\ncause of the discharge, and that the company's other multiple\r\nexplanations were pretext.  Similarly, the district judge cannot be\r\ndeemed \"clearly erroneous\" for reaching the same conclusion,\r\nMcKinnon v. Kwong Wah Restaurant, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196739\"><a href=\"/opinion/196739/mckinnon-v-kwong-wah/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">498</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 508 (1st Cir. 1996),\r\neven if the federal rules as to pretext may differ from the state's\r\nrules.\r\nBay State's other main challenge to the judgment is its\r\nclaim that the district judge could not award more back pay than\r\ndid the jury.  Alexandra Troy disputes that the issue was\r\npreserved, but we find that it was.  After the jury verdict and\r\nbefore the judge's own decision, Alexandra Troy made clear that she\r\nwas seeking a larger back pay award from the judge; Bay State\r\npromptly objected to this request on the ground that the jury\r\ndecision prevented it--and did so well before the district judge\r\nmade the larger award.\r\nThe jury's award was made under chapter 151B, and the\r\ndistrict court rested its larger award on Title VII.  But no one\r\nhas suggested that there was any pertinent difference in the\r\nstandards for measuring back pay; under both rubrics Alexandra Troy\r\nwas entitled to recover, although only once, for what she would\r\nhave earned absent the discharge, reduced by any compensation that\r\nshe actually received during the same period and any additional\r\namount that she would have received through reasonable efforts to\r\nmitigate her damages.  See 42 U.S.C.  2000e-5(g)(1); Conway v.\r\nElectro Switch Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2061499\"><a href=\"/opinion/2061499/conway-v-electro-switch-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 389 (1988).  \r\nThe jury did not explain its reasons for awarding only\r\n$15,000 as back pay but, given the arguments made to it at trial,\r\nthe jury may have thought Alexandra Troy did not do enough to\r\nmitigate damages; indeed, Bay State argued that it had offered to\r\ntake her back.  The district judge, by contrast, simply multiplied\r\nTroy's weekly salary at Bay State by the number of weeks she\r\nremained unemployed after her discharge prior to the date of the\r\ntrial and deducted periods of unpaid maternity leave.  He also\r\nallowed prejudgment interest.  \r\nPrejudgment interest aside, the difference in calculation\r\nin back pay turns on issues that are either strictly factual or\r\nfact-bound applications of general principles like mitigation.  It\r\nis not surprising that two different factfinders should view the\r\nmatter differently, and probably either outcome could be supported\r\non this record.  The question posed is whether the district judge\r\nwas bound to respect the jury's prior calculation of back pay.  \r\nThe problem arises because the state claim under chapter\r\n151B carries a Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial, seeGallagher v. Wilton Enter., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"582535\"><a href=\"/opinion/582535/59-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1251-58-empl-prac-dec-p-41431-carolyn-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">962</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 123-24 (1st Cir.\r\n1992), but at the time of trial in this case, Alexandra Troy's\r\npreexisting Title VII claim was still treated as an equitable one\r\nnot subject to the Seventh Amendment and triable to the judge.\r\nWhere there are overlapping claims, some triable to the judge and\r\nsome to the jury, the Supreme Court has instructed that the jury\r\nclaims be resolved first in order to protect the right to jury\r\ntrial.  Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105889\"><a href=\"/opinion/105889/beacon-theatres-inc-v-westover/\"><span class=\"volume\">359</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">500</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 508-11\r\n(1959).\r\nIn setting this priority rule, the Supreme Court appeared\r\nto conclude that without it, earlier findings by the judge on\r\ncommon issues would bind the jury under some variant of collateral\r\nestoppel.  See Beacon Theatres, 359 U.S. at 503-04, 506-08. \r\nBuilding on this reference, it has become common, in this circuit\r\nas in others, to say that the judge is normally bound by earlier\r\njury findings in the same case on common issues.  See Combustion\r\nEng'g, Inc. v. Miller Hydro Group, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">437</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 444 (1st Cir.\r\n1993); Lopez v. Garriga, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550303\"><a href=\"/opinion/550303/celso-lopez-aka-celso-lopez-lopez-v-rd-garriga/\"><span class=\"volume\">917</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 67 (1st Cir. 1990); 18\r\nWright, Miller &amp; Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure  4418, at\r\n174-75 &amp; n.22 (1981 &amp; Supp. 1997) collecting cases).  We agree\r\nwith Judge Posner that, although the rule \"might be questioned as\r\nan original matter,\" it is now well-established.  McKnight v.\r\nGeneral Motors Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"544666\"><a href=\"/opinion/544666/gary-mcknight-cross-appellant-v-general-motors-corporation-cross-appellee/\"><span class=\"volume\">908</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 113 (7th Cir. 1990), cert.\r\ndenied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">919</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1991).\r\nThe rule is beneficial in minimizing inconsistencies,\r\neven if the efficiencies in timesaving are not as great as with\r\ncollateral estoppel.  And the rule has a further benefit insofar as\r\nit avoids giving one side, but not the other, two bites at the sameapple:  if the judge retries damages, a plaintiff will\r\nautomatically get the larger of the two awards.  Of course, the\r\njudge can always set aside the jury verdict, large or small, if it\r\nis irrational; but no such attack on the jury award could be\r\nsustained in this case.\r\nIn our view, the presumptive rule is that the first\r\nfactfinder binds the second on factual issues actually litigated\r\nand necessary to the result.  This is not a constitutional rule,\r\nbut one of economy similar to collateral estoppel.  While that term\r\nusually refers to the binding effect of a prior final judgment, the\r\nunderlying objectives are similar, and the numerous exceptions to\r\ncollateral estoppel are probably good guides in cases like this\r\none.  See Restatement (Second), Judgments,  28 (1982).  However,\r\nnone of those exceptions, or any other, has been invoked in this\r\ncase.\r\nIf Congress directed in Title VII cases that the district\r\njudge ignore a prior jury finding, an exception to the presumptive\r\nrule of consistency would be warranted.  There is no such explicit\r\ndirective in Title VII, but perhaps an inference as to policy might\r\nbe drawn from legislative history, depending on why Title VII\r\nrelief was originally cast in equitable form.  But the 1991\r\namendment to Title VII (see note 2, above), regardless of its\r\ntechnical effective date, shows that Congress has no present policy\r\nobjection to jury findings in Title VII cases.  See Ballard\r\nShipping Co. v. Beach Shellfish, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"676444\"><a href=\"/opinion/676444/in-re-ballard-shipping-company-etc-v-beach-shellfish/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">623</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 631 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\nIn the present case, Alexandra Troy has not suggested any\r\nreason why, assuming the issue was properly preserved by Bay State,\r\nthe jury finding of back pay should not control the district judge\r\nunder what we hold to be the general rule.  Accordingly, we think\r\nthat the district court was obliged to accept the $15,000 figure as\r\nthe proper amount of back pay.  However, the decision to award pre-\r\njudgment interest is within the trial court's discretion, Hogan v.\r\nBangor &amp; Aroostook R. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"701264\"><a href=\"/opinion/701264/donald-hogan-v-bangor-and-aroostook-railroad-company-donald-hogan-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1034</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1038 (1st Cir. 1995), and\r\nwe see no reason why awarding prejudgment interest on the back pay\r\naward as computed by the jury would not be appropriate.  \r\nBay State has also objected to the district court's\r\nfailure to deduct from its own back pay judgment the amount of\r\n$20,984, constituting income earned and employment compensation\r\ncollected by Alexandra Troy between the time she was fired by Bay\r\nState and the time she brought her lawsuit.  Alexandra Troy, in\r\nturn, argues that Bay State has waived this argument.  As far as we\r\ncan tell, the jury's back pay determination included reductions for\r\nany offsetting benefits obtained by Alexandra Troy, and the\r\nseparate figure determined by the district court is moot in light\r\nof our determination that the district judge was bound by the\r\njury's determination. \r\nFinally, Bay State argues that the district court abused\r\nits discretion by awarding Alexandra Troy the full amount of\r\nattorneys' fees she requested.  Determining the fee award under\r\nTitle VII is committed to the \"particularly broad\" discretion of\r\nthe trial court.  Phetosomphone v. Allison Reed Group, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599014\"><a href=\"/opinion/599014/60-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1120-60-empl-prac-dec-p-41982-nenh/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 6 (1st Cir. 1993).  But Bay State argues that the award of\r\nattorneys' fees and costs ($99,584.91) must be an abuse of\r\ndiscretion because it vastly exceeds the amount of damages to which\r\nAlexandra Troy is properly entitled ($29,300 plus interest on back\r\npay yet to be recomputed).\r\nOne element that a district court considers in awarding\r\nfees is the actual amount of compensatory damages recovered,\r\nalthough it may be \"only one of many factors.\"  City of Riversidev. Rivera, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111730\"><a href=\"/opinion/111730/riverside-v-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">561</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 574 (1986) (plurality opinion).  And in\r\nthis case, the district court's ruling on the fee application\r\nappeared to give weight to the very substantial Title VII award\r\nmade by the district court.  In these circumstances, we think it\r\nbest that the district judge make a fresh determination of the\r\naward of attorneys' fees in light of the greatly reduced back pay\r\naward that will be entered as part of the new final judgment.\r\nThe judgment is vacated and remanded for proceedings\r\nconsistent with this opinion.  Each side shall bear its own costs\r\non this appeal.\n</pre>",
