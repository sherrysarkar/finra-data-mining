The issue on appeal is whether\n\na federal district court sitting in Massachusetts has specific\n\npersonal jurisdiction over a suit brought by Richard A. Daynard,\n\na   Massachusetts   law    professor,      for   fees    in    the   tobacco\n\nlitigation,   against     the    Mississippi     law    firm   of    Scruggs,\n\nMillette, Bozeman & Dent, and Richard Scruggs, a senior partner\n\n(\"Scruggs defendants\").         At the heart of Daynard's claim is the\n\nargument that the court may reach the Scruggs defendants based\n\nin large part on contacts imputed from the South Carolina law\n\nfirm of Ness, Motley, Loadholt, Richardson & Poole, and Ronald\n\nMotley (\"Motley defendants\"), all of whom purportedly acted on\n\nbehalf of both firms in engaging Daynard to work on litigation\n\nagainst the tobacco industry.          We conclude, contrary to the\n\ndistrict court, that the Scruggs defendants are subject to\n\nspecific personal jurisdiction based on their contacts with\n\nMassachusetts, particularly those contacts properly attributed\n\nto them from the Motley defendants, who are also defendants in\n\nthis litigation.\n\n          Daynard is a law professor at Northeastern University\n\nspecializing in litigation against the tobacco industry.                   He\n\nsued the Motley and Scruggs defendants, claiming that, pursuant\n\n                                     -2-\n\fto an oral agreement, he is entitled to a portion of the fees\n\nthat   these   firms    have    received   or   will   receive    from   their\n\nsuccessful tobacco litigation.\n\n           The Motley defendants, based on their Massachusetts\n\ncontacts, concede personal jurisdiction, but, central to this\n\ncase, the Scruggs defendants do not.            Daynard does not challenge\n\nthe district court's conclusion that the Scruggs defendants' own\n\ndirect   contacts       with    Massachusetts      are,   by     themselves,\n\ninsufficient    to     permit   personal   jurisdiction.         Instead,    he\n\nchallenges     the      district    court's      ruling    that     personal\n\njurisdiction does not exist based on the imputation of some of\n\nthe Motley defendants' contacts, which were purportedly made on\n\nbehalf of both law firms, to the Scruggs defendants.                        The\n\ndistrict court reasoned that the Motley defendants were not the\n\nScruggs defendants' agents, and, even if they were, the Scruggs\n\ndefendants did not exert \"substantial influence\" over the Motley\n\ndefendants' in-forum activities.           The district court reasoned\n\nthat it could not, consistent with the Due Process Clause of the\n\nFourteenth Amendment, attribute the Motley defendants' contacts\n\nto the Scruggs defendants for purposes of personal jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f             Daynard appeals this decision arguing that the district\n\ncourt erred by relying on a general jurisdiction case, Donatelli\n\nv. National Hockey League, 893 F.2d 459 (1st Cir. 1990), to\n\nderive the \"substantial influence\" requirement.            Daynard argues\n\nthat he need not show, for specific jurisdiction purposes, that\n\nthe Scruggs defendants exerted substantial influence over the\n\nMotley defendants' in-forum activities in order to impute the\n\nMotley defendants' contacts to the Scruggs defendants.            Daynard\n\nasserts that the defendants were engaged in a tobacco litigation\n\njoint venture and that, on this basis, attribution is proper.\n\n             We conclude that Donatelli's substantial influence test\n\nis not controlling in this case, where Daynard alleges that the\n\ndefendants were in a joint venture, or at least held themselves\n\nout to be in a type of agency relationship.                 We need not\n\ndetermine whether the defendants were actually engaged in a\n\njoint   venture    between   themselves,   however.    The     facts,   as\n\nasserted by Daynard and construed in the light of whether he has\n\nmade a prima facie jurisdictional showing, suffice to show a\n\nrelationship between the two defendants sufficient to impute\n\nsome    of   the   Motley    defendants'   contacts   to    the   Scruggs\n\ndefendants.     These same facts show that the Scruggs defendants\n\n                                   -4-\n\fheld themselves out to be in some form of an agency relationship\n\nwith the Motley defendants and, by accepting and encouraging\n\nDaynard's services, and agreeing to compensate him on the basis\n\nof a share of the fees, ratified the Motley defendants' in-forum\n\nactivities giving rise to this lawsuit.\n\n          Traditional common law concepts, embodied in the law\n\nof Massachusetts, Mississippi, and South Carolina, confirm the\n\nfundamental fairness of requiring the Scruggs defendants to\n\nanswer   in   Massachusetts.      We    conclude   that   the   Scruggs\n\ndefendants'   contacts   with   Massachusetts,     particularly   those\n\ncontacts of the Motley defendants properly attributed to the\n\nScruggs defendants, suffice to permit personal jurisdiction over\n\nthe Scruggs defendants consistent with the Massachusetts long-\n\narm statute and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          In this case there are many disputed, and as of yet\n\nunresolved, facts.       We do not resolve these disputed facts\n\nbecause we \"must accept the plaintiff's (properly documented)\n\nevidentiary proffers as true for the purpose of determining the\n\nadequacy of the prima facie jurisdictional showing.\"            Foster-\n\nMiller, Inc. v. Babcock & Wilcox Canada, 46 F.3d 138, 145 (1st\n\n                                  -5-\n\fCir. 1995).      We use Daynard's version of the facts (although we\n\nprovide   a     brief      description         of    the     defendants'       competing\n\nversion),      drawn      from    his   complaint,          both   sides'     subsequent\n\naffidavits,      and      the     products      of    jurisdictional          discovery,\n\nincluding Daynard's deposition of Scruggs.\n\nA. Daynard's Allegations\n\n            Daynard is a resident and citizen of the Commonwealth\n\nof Massachusetts.           He is, and has been for over thirty years, a\n\nlaw professor at Northeastern University School of Law, located\n\nin Massachusetts.           For much of that time, he has focused his\n\nprofessional        and    academic      efforts      on     defeating      the   tobacco\n\nindustry in court.               Daynard is Chair of the Tobacco Product\n\nLiability Project, President of the Tobacco Control Resources\n\nCenter, and a frequent advocate for, and consultant to, those\n\nopposing the tobacco industry.\n\n            For many years there was a consensus that the potential\n\nfor   recovery      against       the    tobacco      industry      was     negligible.\n\nIndeed, the tobacco industry, until 1997, boasted that it had\n\nnever   paid    a    cent    to    a    tort    plaintiff.         As   of    2002,   the\n\nsituation is drastically different.                         Lawyers have sued the\n\ntobacco   companies         on     behalf      of    many    states     and    recovered\n\n                                            -6-\n\fastronomical sums for those states, with consequently large fees\n\nfor themselves.       During the past several years, almost every\n\nstate   has   sued   the   tobacco   industry,   seeking,   among   other\n\nthings, reimbursement for the medical costs incurred as a result\n\nof smoking-related health harms.           The defendant law firms in\n\nthis case have been responsible for instituting, litigating, and\n\nsettling litigation against the tobacco industry on behalf of forty-six\n\ndifferent states. This settlement was accomplished, in part, in what\n\nis known as the Master Settlement Agreement. See National Association\n\nof   Attorneys       General,   Master     Settlement   Agreement,     at\n\nhttp://www.naag.org/tobac/cigmsa.rtf (Nov. 23, 1998); Greenless v.\n\nAlmond, 277 F.3d 601, 603 (1st Cir. 2002) (describing the tobacco\n\nlitigation and settlement). Daynard says this settlement will result\n\nin a distribution of billions of dollars to the two firms.\n\n          Daynard says that his efforts were central to many of these\n\ntitanic recoveries. He quotes reputable authorities stating that\n\nhe is the \"recognized leader\" in tobacco litigation on behalf of\n\nthe public health and the \"foremost authority\" on,          and \"driving\n\nforce\" behind, anti-tobacco legal theory and strategy.          In fact,\n\nDaynard quotes one authority stating that without Daynard's\n\ntobacco work, the state-initiated tobacco litigation would not\n\neven exist.\n\n                                     -7-\n\f           The parties agree that Charles Patrick, then a partner\n\nat Ness Motley, came to Boston, Massachusetts in the fall of\n\n1993 to meet with Daynard.      Daynard says that, at the time\n\nPatrick traveled to Boston to retain his services, Ness Motley\n\nand Scruggs Millette were engaged in a tobacco litigation joint\n\nventure.   Indeed, throughout his dealings with Ness Motley and\n\nScruggs Millette, Daynard understood the two firms to be in a\n\njoint venture that at first encompassed the Mississippi tobacco\n\nlitigation and then broadened to include tobacco litigation\n\nnationwide.   Daynard insists that Patrick was acting on behalf\n\nof both firms and that Patrick retained him to advance the\n\nobjectives of the firms' joint venture.\n\n           Shortly after this initial meeting in Boston, Daynard\n\ntraveled to Ness Motley's South Carolina offices, where he met\n\nwith members of the firm, including Ronald Motley.      At these\n\nmeetings, Daynard identified and explained legal theories for\n\nrecovery on behalf of state governments.   After these meetings,\n\nDaynard continued to communicate regularly, by phone and fax,\n\nwith members of Ness Motley, providing them advice on similar\n\nmatters.\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\f            As    a     result     of    Ness    Motley's       retention      of    him,\n\npurportedly       on    behalf      of   both     firms,       Daynard   also       began\n\n\"communicat[ing]         regularly\"        with    the     Mississippi        law    firm\n\nScruggs   Millette           and   providing      the    firm    with    \"advice      and\n\nassistance.\"          Beginning in the fall of 1993, members of both\n\nfirms came to Boston to meet with and receive advice from\n\nDaynard, in furtherance of his engagement by them.1                           According\n\nto his affidavit, Daynard \"had many conversations, meetings and\n\nwritten communications in Boston with members of the defendant\n\nfirms, in which [he] provided advice and undertook specific\n\nprojects for their use in the tobacco litigation.\"\n\n            Daynard asserts that his legal theories, strategies,\n\nevidence,     and       arguments        \"subsequently          formed    a     central\n\ncomponent\" of the firms' litigation brought on behalf of several\n\nstates against the tobacco industry.                          In addition, Daynard\n\nintroduced       Ness    Motley     firm   members       to    experienced     tobacco\n\nlitigators       and    to    pleading     and    discovery      files   from       other\n\ntobacco cases.\n\n\n\n\n     1    Scruggs denies that he participated in any such meeting\nin Boston for these purposes.\n\n                                           -9-\n\f            Initially, Ness Motley compensated Daynard based on\n\nhourly   fees   for   his   services   rendered.     As   Daynard's\n\nrelationship with the two firms progressed, he had \"several\n\nconversations\" with \"both Mr. Motley and Mr. Scruggs in which\n\nthey stated that they would appropriately compensate [Daynard]\n\n. . . and that the final form of compensation would be\" in the\n\nform of a share of the fees the firms obtained from handling the\n\nstates' tobacco litigation.    Ronald Motley advised Daynard that\n\nhe would be compensated for his assistance as a member of the\n\nNess Motley \"team.\"   After this communication, Daynard says that\n\nhe received no further compensation from Ness Motley.        As to\n\npayment by Scruggs Millette, the parties agree that Scruggs\n\nMillette never compensated Daynard.\n\n            When the state tobacco litigation commenced, Daynard\n\ncontinued to work with both firms, educating their attorneys on\n\nthe relevant issues, counseling them based on his experience in\n\nother tobacco litigation, providing them with relevant documents\n\nand information, and introducing them to potential witnesses and\n\ncontacts.     He developed litigation strategies and worked on\n\npleadings and other documents for the firms.         Many of these\n\nservices were performed in Boston.     See Daynard v. Ness, Motley,\n\n                                -10-\n\fLoadholt, Richardson & Poole, P.A., 188 F. Supp. 2d 115, 118\n\n(2002)   (stating    that   \"Daynard      performed    his   research    and\n\nwriting, met with Ness Motley partners, and allegedly formed a\n\ncompensation contract in Massachusetts\"); id. at 119.               Daynard\n\nalso spoke at conferences of state governmental officials where\n\nhe arranged for Ness Motley and Scruggs Millette to participate,\n\nthereby advancing their ongoing litigation and providing them\n\nwith legitimacy in the eyes of potential state clients.\n\n          Ness Motley recognized and encouraged Daynard's efforts\n\nby   assigning   him    specific     projects,    by     requesting      his\n\ninformation and assistance, by transporting him to selected\n\nmeetings and proceedings, and by accepting his work product.              At\n\nsome point in 1996, when Daynard became concerned that some Ness\n\nMotley   attorneys   were   trying     to   minimize   his   role   in   the\n\nlitigation, Mr. Motley assured Daynard that this was not the\n\ncase.\n\n          In July of 1996, when Daynard reported to Ness Motley\n\non the time he had expended to complete a research project that\n\nNess Motley had requested, the firm, consistent with its own and\n\nthe Scruggs defendants' past assurances, informed Daynard that\n\nit would compensate him for his work by paying him a share of\n\n                                   -11-\n\fthe   fees    generated    if    the    litigation     was     successful,    an\n\narrangement to which Daynard agreed.                 As a result of this\n\npromise, Daynard ceased submitting descriptions of his hourly\n\nwork and requests for payment to Ness Motley.\n\n             Daynard says that, at a meeting in late August of 1996,\n\nScruggs Millette and Ness Motley \"confirmed\" their agreement to\n\ncompensate him in the form of a share of the fees.                On August 25\n\nthrough August 27, 1996, Daynard, Motley, and Scruggs were in\n\nChicago, Illinois, participating in meetings related to the\n\nstate   tobacco    litigation.         Scruggs   and    Motley    scheduled    a\n\nmeeting with Daynard during that period to discuss Daynard's\n\nspecific share of any fee award.          Although Motley was ultimately\n\nnot   able   to   attend   the   meeting,     Daynard    met    with   Scruggs.\n\nDaynard says he asked Scruggs \"whether he was speaking for both\n\nhimself and Mr. Motley\" and Scruggs stated that he was, that\n\nDaynard could rely on this, and that he was acting with at least\n\n\"apparent authority\" for Motley.          Scruggs promised Daynard 5% of\n\nany fees ultimately recovered, in any state tobacco litigation\n\nin which any of the defendants were counsel, as compensation for\n\nDaynard's past and continuing assistance.                    Daynard says he\n\naccepted the 5% agreement and that he and Scruggs shook hands on\n\n                                       -12-\n\fit.    Based on the conduct of the Scruggs and Motley defendants\n\nduring the course of the tobacco litigation, Daynard says that\n\nhe    reasonably   believed   Scruggs      to   be   acting   with    apparent\n\nauthority for both firms.\n\n           Relying on this 5% figure, and \"ongoing assurances and\n\nrepresentations,\" Daynard continued to work for the two firms.\n\nFor example, Scruggs requested that Daynard be available during\n\nthe trial in the Mississippi litigation and agreed to compensate\n\nDaynard for the cost of paying a substitute teacher to cover his\n\nNortheastern University teaching obligations.            Daynard agreed by\n\ncommitting $15,000 of his own personal funds to buy himself out\n\nof his teaching obligations so that he could be present full-\n\ntime during the trial.\n\n           Almost a year after the alleged handshake on the 5%\n\ncompensation figure, and after the Mississippi state litigation\n\nhad reached a tentative settlement, Daynard wrote a letter to\n\nScruggs confirming the fee arrangement and identifying certain\n\nexpenses    that    Daynard   had    incurred        associated      with   the\n\nMississippi litigation.       Scruggs never responded.         A few months\n\nlater, Daynard wrote another letter, this time to both Scruggs\n\nand Motley, referring to the 5% fee arrangement.              At this point,\n\n                                    -13-\n\fboth firms were expecting to reap significant attorney's fees\n\nfrom   the    Mississippi       settlement    and   also   from    the   Florida\n\nsettlement.        Joseph Rice of Ness Motley and Richard Scruggs both\n\nresponded to this second letter and both disavowed the 5% fee\n\narrangement.         Neither firm has paid Daynard any of the legal\n\nfees it has received to date.             Daynard alleges that the firms\n\nbased their refusal to pay him the 5% on his failure to support\n\ncertain national tobacco liability legislation, a requirement he\n\nsays    the        defendants    never    mentioned        in   any      previous\n\ncommunication.\n\nB. State Court Proceedings, Federal District Court Proceedings,\n   and the Defendants' Side of the Story\n\n              On    December    27,   2000,    Daynard      sued   the     Motley\n\ndefendants and the Scruggs defendants in the Superior Court for\n\nSuffolk County, Massachusetts, seeking, among other things,\n\ncompensation in the form of what Daynard says is his rightful\n\nshare of fees generated from settlements with several states,\n\nnot including Massachusetts.             Daynard claims that Ness Motley\n\nand Scruggs Millette have already received millions and will\n\nreceive over two billion dollars of the fees generated from the\n\nsettlement, 5% of which he claims is rightfully his.                     With the\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fconsent of the Motley defendants, the Scruggs defendants removed\n\nthe case to federal district court on January 18, 2001.    See 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1441 (1994).\n\n         In their answer, the Motley defendants conceded the\n\nMassachusetts court's personal jurisdiction, but told a story on\n\nthe merits very different from Daynard's.   The Motley defendants\n\nadmit that, in 1993, Patrick of Ness Motley met Daynard in\n\nMassachusetts, and that the firm continued to meet with and\n\ncommunicate with Daynard.   Furthermore, they agree that Daynard\n\nprovided them with documents related to the tobacco litigation,\n\nidentified some potential witnesses, and did some general work\n\non the state tobacco litigation.     The Motley defendants admit\n\nthat the firm made specific requests of Daynard and provided him\n\nwith transportation to certain meetings and proceedings.    They\n\nsay that they paid Daynard for this work.\n\n         But the Motley defendants downplay Daynard's expertise,\n\nsay that his assistance was neither invaluable nor substantial,\n\nand claim that his theories never formed a central component of\n\ntheir tobacco litigation.   Furthermore, they deny that either\n\nthey or Scruggs ever met with Daynard in Chicago and agreed upon\n\nthe 5% figure.    They deny that any agreement as alleged by\n\n                              -15-\n\fDaynard existed.           The Motley defendants' position is that they\n\nhave already paid Daynard any money they ever owed him.\n\n              On    May    30,    2001,   the     Motley   defendants        moved   for\n\nsummary judgment.           The district court denied this motion in part\n\non September 13, 2001, and issued its conclusions in a written\n\nmemorandum         on   December    3,    2001.       Daynard       v.   Ness,   Motley,\n\nLoadholt, Richardson & Poole, P.A., 178 F. Supp. 2d 9 (D. Mass.\n\n2001).       The district court addressed those issues reserved in\n\nthe September 13 hearing and in the December 3 memorandum in a\n\nsecond memorandum and order, in which it denied                            the   Motley\n\ndefendants' motion for summary judgment.                   Daynard, 188 F. Supp.\n\n2d 115.\n\n              The       Scruggs    defendants      pursued      a    different     legal\n\nstrategy.      On April 20, 2001, they moved to dismiss Daynard's\n\ncomplaint for lack of personal jurisdiction or for failure to\n\nstate    a    claim,       and    moved   in    the    alternative        for    summary\n\njudgement.          See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2), 12(b)(6), and 56.\n\nScruggs stated that he never agreed to share any fees with\n\nDaynard and that\n\n              [i]t has always been my understanding that Professor\n              Daynard acted as a volunteer in all of his endeavors\n              with respect to the litigation, or was otherwise\n\n                                          -16-\n\f            compensated by Ness Motley as a consultant on a\n            limited basis, and that his activities were designed\n            primarily to promote his own agenda with respect to\n            tobacco control.\n\n            As    to   personal   jurisdiction,    Scruggs   states   that\n\nneither he nor his firm has ever had any offices, real estate,\n\nbank accounts, or other property in Massachusetts.           Furthermore,\n\nnone   of   the   Scruggs   defendants     has   ever   practiced   law   in\n\nMassachusetts. Daynard does not deny this.          In addition, Scruggs\n\nsays that he has never traveled to Massachusetts in connection\n\nwith any fee sharing arrangement with Daynard or in connection\n\nwith any of Daynard's work under the alleged arrangement.                 He\n\ndenies that he or his firm had any role in contacting or\n\nretaining Daynard in Massachusetts.          He further states that the\n\nScruggs defendants did not request, or even have knowledge of,\n\nthe Motley defendants' meetings with Daynard.                Scruggs also\n\ndenies that the Scruggs defendants or the Mississippi joint\n\nventure, to the extent that it existed, ever gave the Motley\n\ndefendants any directions with respect to Daynard.\n\n            Although Scruggs concedes that \"Daynard did at times\n\nconsult with me concerning the tobacco litigation in general,\"\n\nhe says that \"these instances were extremely infrequent and were\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fnot requested or solicited by me\" and that the \"'assistance' .\n\n. . consisted of nothing more than information already made\n\navailable to the general public.\"\n\n           With    respect   to    any     relationship      between   Scruggs\n\nMillette and Ness Motley, Scruggs stated, in a second affidavit,\n\nthat   Scruggs    Millette   was    part    of   a   written   joint   venture\n\nagreement in the Mississippi litigation, but that Ness Motley\n\nwas not a party to that agreement.               He says that \"[p]rior to\n\nApril of 1999, there was simply no arrangement [between Scruggs\n\nMillette   and    Ness   Motley]    with     respect    to   the   sharing   of\n\nattorney's fees in the nationwide tobacco litigation.\"                 Scruggs\n\nalso noted that there was no agreement that \"either Scruggs\n\nMillette   or     Ness   Motley    could    exert    control    over   tobacco\n\nlitigation in states where those firms were not counsel of\n\nrecord.\"\n\n           The district court, after one hearing on May 31, 2001,\n\nand after granting Daynard limited jurisdictional discovery on\n\nthe issue of the relationship between the defendants from 1992\n\nto 1998, held another hearing on September 13, 2001, in which it\n\ndismissed Daynard's complaint against the Scruggs defendants for\n\nlack of personal jurisdiction.             At that September 13 hearing,\n\n                                     -18-\n\fthe district court stated what it labeled the \"bottom line of\n\n[its]   reasoning\"     for   finding       that   it     lacked     personal\n\njurisdiction over the Scruggs defendants:\n\n          [W]hile the facts are sufficient to show a joint\n          venture with respect to the Mississippi litigation, as\n          the First Circuit has defined the term substantial\n          influence in the Donatelli versus National Hockey\n          League case, there is insufficient evidence in this\n          case that the Mississippi law firm or Mr. Scruggs\n          exercised a substantial influence over the Ness firm\n          such as would subject Scruggs or the Mississippi firm\n          to personal jurisdiction in Massachusetts.\n\nSoon after that, the court entered final judgment in favor of\n\nthe Scruggs defendants, thus permitting an immediate appeal to\n\nthis court.\n\n          The    district    court     supported       its     September    13\n\nconclusion in a December 21, 2001, memorandum.               Daynard v. Ness,\n\nMotley, Loadholt, Richardson & Poole, P.A., 184 F. Supp. 2d 55\n\n(D.   Mass.   2001).    In   that    memorandum,       the   district    court\n\naddressed two theories on which Daynard might show personal\n\njurisdiction over the Scruggs defendants.          Id. at 60-76.        First,\n\nthe district court concluded that it did not have personal\n\njurisdiction over the Scruggs defendants based on their own\n\ndirect contacts with Massachusetts.           Id. at 68.         Second, the\n\ndistrict court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over the\n\n                                    -19-\n\fScruggs defendants based on contacts imputed from the Motley\n\ndefendants.   Id. at 76.   The district court reasoned that the\n\nScruggs defendants \"likely were not in a joint venture\" with the\n\nMotley defendants,2 that the Motley defendants did not act as the\n\nScruggs defendants' agent,3 and that the \"substantial influence\"\n\nrequirement articulated in Donatelli, 893 F.2d at 469, 472,\n\nprecluded jurisdiction under the Due Process Clause, U.S. Const.\n\namend. XIV.   Daynard, 184 F. Supp. 2d at 74-76.   Daynard appeals\n\nthe district court's holding that it lacks personal jurisdiction\n\nunder an imputed or attributed contacts theory.4\n\n\n     2    This conclusion is in some tension with the district\ncourt's earlier explanation, at the September 13 hearing, that\n\"the facts are sufficient to show a joint venture with respect\nto the Mississippi litigation.\"\n     3    Earlier in its opinion, however, the district court\nnoted that \"the South Carolina defendants arguably acted as the\nMississippi defendants' emissary,\" Daynard, 184 F. Supp. 2d at\n66, an observation seemingly inconsistent with its conclusion\nthat no agency relationship existed.\n     4    Daynard focuses on the district court's attributed\ncontacts holding rather than on the district court's conclusion\nthat the Scruggs defendants' direct contacts are insufficient.\nThe Scruggs defendants emphasize this, noting that Daynard has\nnot argued that their direct contacts alone are sufficient to\npermit personal jurisdiction. We agree that Daynard does not\nadvance this argument, but note that many of those facts,\ninsufficient to establish jurisdiction based on the Scruggs\ndefendants' direct contacts, are, of course, relevant to the\nimputed contacts analysis as well. One cannot make a sensible\n\n                              -20-\n\f                               II.\n\nA. Burden of Proof and Standard of Review\n\n         To hear a case, a court must have personal jurisdiction\n\nover the parties, \"that is, the power to require the parties to\n\nobey its decrees.\"   United States v. Swiss Am. Bank, Ltd., 191\n\nF.3d 30, 35 (1st Cir. 1999).   The plaintiff bears the burden of\n\nproving the court's personal jurisdiction over the defendant.\n\nFoster-Miller, 46 F.3d at 145; Boit v. Gar-Tec Prods., Inc., 967\n\nF.2d 671, 674-75 (1st Cir. 1992).     The district court, faced\n\nwith a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 12(b)(2), may choose from among several methods for\n\ndetermining whether the plaintiff has met this burden.   Foster-\n\nMiller, 46 F.3d at 145; Boit, 967 F.2d at 674-75.     \"The most\n\nconventional of these methods,\" known as the \"prima facie\"\n\nmethod, Foster-Miller, 46 F.3d at 145, \"permits the district\n\ncourt 'to consider only whether the plaintiff has proffered\n\nevidence that, if credited, is enough to support findings of all\n\n\n\n\ninquiry into whether contacts imputed to the Scruggs defendants\nsupport personal jurisdiction without viewing those same\ncontacts in the context of all of the other alleged facts of the\ncase.\n\n                               -21-\n\ffacts essential to personal jurisdiction,'\" id. (quoting Boit,\n\n967 F.2d at 675).5\n\n          The district court applied the prima facie method.\n\nDaynard, 184 F. Supp. 2d at 61.         We review the district court's\n\nchoice of method de novo.        Foster-Miller, 46 F.3d at 147.      The\n\nparties do not object to the district court's choice of the\n\nprima facie method.           Daynard states in his brief that the\n\ndistrict court employed the prima facie approach and the Scruggs\n\ndefendants    agree,    making     no     attempt   to   challenge   the\n\napplicability    of    this    approach.      Therefore,   the   Scruggs\n\ndefendants have waived any objection to the application of the\n\nprima facie method.      Cashmere & Camel Hair Mfrs. Inst. v.

Under these circumstances, we\n\naccept the prima facie method.6\n\n\n     5    For a discussion of other potential methods of\nanalysis, see Foster-Miller, 46 F.3d at 145-46 (describing\n\"prima facie,\" \"preponderance-of-the-evidence,\" and \"likelihood\"\nstandards).\n     6     When \"the assertion of jurisdiction is bound up with the\nclaim on the merits,\" but there exists \"the possibility of permitting\na dubious case to proceed beyond the pleading stage, and even to trial,\nthough the court eventually will be found to lack jurisdiction,\" we\n\n                                   -22-\n\f            Accordingly, Daynard has the burden of making a prima\n\nfacie     showing       of     personal    jurisdiction       over    the    Scruggs\n\ndefendants.          We       \"must   accept       the     plaintiff's      (properly\n\ndocumented) evidentiary proffers as true for the purpose of\n\ndetermining       the    adequacy     of    the    prima    facie    jurisdictional\n\nshowing.\"        Foster-Miller, 46 F.3d at 145.

Sch. of Law, 142 F.3d at 34.\n\nGeneral jurisdiction exists when the defendant has engaged in\n\n\"continuous and systematic activity\" in the forum, even if the\n\nactivity is unrelated to the suit.    United Elec., Radio & Mach.\n\nWorkers v. 163 Pleasant St. Corp., 960 F.2d 1080, 1088 (1st Cir.\n\n1992).   This is not such a case and no party suggests that it\n\nis.    \"In the absence of general jurisdiction, a court's power\n\ndepends upon the existence of specific jurisdiction.\"      Mass.\n\nSch. of Law, 142 F.3d at 34.\n\n           To establish personal jurisdiction, Daynard must show\n\nthat the Massachusetts long-arm statute grants jurisdiction and,\n\nif it does, that the exercise of jurisdiction under the statute\n\nis consistent with the constitution.    Foster-Miller, 46 F.3d at\n\n144.\n\n           Daynard's complaint pleads that personal jurisdiction\n\nexists under subsections (a), (c), and (d) of the Massachusetts\n\n\n\n\n                               -24-\n\flong-arm statute.      Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 223A, § 3 (2000).7      The\n\nrelevant   provision    is   §   3(a).   The   question   under   this\n\nsubsection is whether the Scruggs defendants \"act[ed] directly\n\nor by an agent, as to a cause of action . . . arising from the\n\n[defendants'] . . . transacting any business in\" Massachusetts.\n\nId. § 3(a).      We may sidestep the statutory inquiry and proceed\n\ndirectly to the constitutional analysis, however, because the\n\nSupreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has interpreted the\n\nstate's long-arm statute \"as an assertion of jurisdiction over\n\nthe person to the limits allowed by the Constitution of the\n\n\n    7      The statute states, in relevant part:\n\n    A Court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a person,\n    who acts directly or by an agent, as to a cause of action\n    in law or equity arising from the person's\n\n           (a)    transacting any business     in this commonwealth;\n                  . . .\n\n           (c)    causing tortious injury by an act or omission in\n                  this commonwealth; [or]\n\n           (d)    causing tortious injury in this commonwealth by\n                  an act or omission outside this commonwealth if\n                  he regularly does or solicits business, or\n                  engages in any other persistent course of\n                  conduct, or derives substantial revenue . . . ,\n                  in this commonwealth . . . .\n\nMass.

In\n\na contract case, we evaluate the parties' \"prior negotiations\n\n                                           -26-\n\fand contemplated future consequences, along with the terms of\n\nthe contract and the parties' actual course of dealing\" to\n\ndetermine      whether    the   defendants        purposefully    established\n\nminimum contacts.        Burger King, 471 U.S. at 479.\n\n            The more difficult question in this case is whether any\n\nof the Motley defendants' contacts may be imputed to the Scruggs\n\ndefendants for purposes of establishing \"minimum contacts.\"                  We\n\nconclude that some of these contacts may be imputed.                 The next\n\nquestion is whether the sum of any imputed and direct contacts\n\npermits the court to exercise personal jurisdiction over the\n\nScruggs   defendants       consistent      with    the   Constitution.       We\n\nconclude that these contacts suffice under Supreme Court law,\n\ne.g., Burger King, 471 U.S. at 471-87; Int'l Shoe, 326 U.S. 310,\n\nand the law of this circuit, e.g., Noonan, 135 F.3d at 90;\n\nFoster-Miller, 46 F.3d at 144.\n\nC. Imputed Contacts\n\n            Daynard      alleges    that   the    relationship   between   the\n\nMotley defendants and the Scruggs defendants is such that some\n\nof the Motley defendants' contacts with Massachusetts should be\n\nimputed   to    the   Scruggs      defendants.      As   the   district   court\n\nrecognized, whether the defendants were in all respects joint\n\n                                      -27-\n\fventurers is not alone dispositive, Daynard, 184 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n74,   although       the   parties   focus   much   of   their   energies    on\n\ndisputing this particular issue.             The basic question is whether\n\nthe relationship between the Scruggs defendants and the Motley\n\ndefendants, however one labels it, is sufficient to attribute\n\nany of the Motley defendants' contacts to the Scruggs defendants\n\nfor the purpose of reaching the Scruggs defendants under the\n\nMassachusetts long-arm statute as cabined by the Due Process\n\nClause   of    the    Fourteenth     Amendment.     We   conclude   that    the\n\nrelationship was sufficient for that purpose.               Daynard has put\n\nforth evidence that, if credited and accepted as true, is enough\n\nto support personal jurisdiction over the Scruggs defendants.\n\n              Daynard alleges that the Motley defendants and the\n\nScruggs defendants were part of a formal, written joint venture\n\nbetween themselves.          He also says that he believed the parties\n\nto be joint venturers because they \"consistently purported to\n\nbe\" in such a relationship.            Daynard argues that at the time\n\nCharles Patrick of Ness Motley came to Massachusetts to retain\n\nhim, Ness Motley and Scruggs Millette were engaged in a form of\n\ntobacco litigation joint venture.            Daynard says that Patrick was\n\nacting for both firms when Patrick retained him and that Patrick\n\n                                      -28-\n\fretained him to advance the objectives of the joint venture.\n\nThroughout his dealings with Ness Motley and Scruggs Millette,\n\nhe understood the two firms to be in a joint venture that at\n\nfirst encompassed the Mississippi tobacco litigation and then\n\nbroadened to include tobacco litigation nationwide.\n\n            1. Applicability of Donatelli's \"substantial\n               influence\" test.\n\n            First, there is the threshold question of whether the\n\ndistrict court properly applied Donatelli, 893 F.2d 459, as the\n\ngoverning     test.       The   parties    devote   the   majority     of   their\n\nattention to this issue, but it is not dispositive of the\n\npersonal jurisdiction question.              The district court concluded\n\nthat   even    if   the    Motley    defendants     acted   as   the    Scruggs\n\ndefendants'     agents,     \"there   was     no   substantial    influence     as\n\nrequired by Due Process.\"           Daynard, 184 F. Supp. 2d at 76.           The\n\ndistrict court derived this \"substantial influence\" requirement\n\nfrom Donatelli, 893 F.2d at 469, a general jurisdiction case.\n\nThe district court was in error.             It read Donatelli as applying\n\nan exclusive test and as applying in the present, very different\n\ncontext.      This over-reads Donatelli.\n\n            The question before us is whether Daynard must meet the\n\n\n                                      -29-\n\fsubstantial   influence     test     in   order    to   comply   with\n\njurisdictional Due Process requirements.          Although   Donatelli\n\naids our inquiry, we conclude that its substantial influence\n\ntest is not the exclusive test for attribution of conduct.          It\n\ndoes not control the matter before us here, where the questions\n\nare whether the Scruggs defendants were in an actual or apparent\n\nagency relationship, or at least held themselves out to be in a\n\njoint venture or other agency relationship with the Motley\n\ndefendants, and whether the Scruggs defendants ratified the\n\nMotley defendants' conduct.\n\n         In Donatelli, this court held that\n\n         an unincorporated association which does not itself\n         conduct   significant   activities   in,   or   enjoy\n         affiliating circumstances with, a state cannot be\n         subject to the general personal jurisdiction of the\n         state's courts on the basis of a member's contacts\n         within the state unless the member carries on the in-\n         forum activities under the association's substantial\n         influence.\n\nId. at 472.   Donatelli sued the National Hockey League (\"NHL\")\n\nin Rhode Island, challenging the NHL's draft and its failure to\n\ndeclare him a free agent.   Jurisdiction in Rhode Island over the\n\nNHL was premised on the fact that a member team of the NHL had\n\ncontacts with Rhode Island.        His suit was unrelated to either\n\n\n                               -30-\n\fthe NHL's contacts with Rhode Island or its member's contacts\n\nwith Rhode Island.        Id. at 462.     The Donatelli court rejected\n\nthe theory that the NHL could be subject to general personal\n\njurisdiction in Rhode Island simply because one of its members\n\nwas subject to general jurisdiction in that state.           Id. at 472.\n\nIt   concluded    that,   in   these    circumstances,   a   showing   of\n\n\"substantial influence\" was necessary in order to attribute\n\none's contacts to the other consistent with the requirement of\n\npurposeful availment.       Id. at 469.\n\n            Donatelli's substantial influence test does not control\n\nthe entire universe of cases in which one party's contacts might\n\nbe attributed to another.       By its terms, Donatelli applies \"in\n\nthe world of unincorporated associations.\"        Id. at 468.    Indeed,\n\nas Donatelli itself observed, the substantial influence test\n\ndoes not control where one seeks to attribute contacts from\n\npartner to partnership or from subsidiary to corporate parent.\n\nId. at 465-67.     In the partnership context, \"the activities of\n\nthe partner are generally attributed to the partnership and\n\njurisdiction over the partnership follows from the partner's\n\ncontacts,    if   sufficient,     regardless     of   the    absence   of\n\nindependent contacts between the partnership qua entity and the\n\n                                  -31-\n\fforum.\"    Id. at 466.       Donatelli's substantial influence test\n\ndoes not apply here, where the question is whether an actual or\n\nimplied agency relationship, sufficient to attribute contacts,\n\nexisted between the parties.          We conclude that, similar to some\n\ncases involving actual partnerships, the relationship between\n\nthe defendants here invokes certain principles of the law of\n\nagency, partnership, and joint venture and that these principles\n\npermit imputing contacts without the need to show substantial\n\ninfluence.\n\n            In   addition,     although      we     do   not   decide   whether\n\nDonatelli's approach to attribution is necessarily limited to\n\ngeneral jurisdiction cases, we note, as stated several times in\n\nthe Donatelli opinion, including in the above quoted passage,\n\nthat Donatelli \"focus[ed] . . . upon . . . general as opposed to\n\nspecific jurisdiction.\" Id. at 463; see also id. at 461 (stating the\n\nissue on appeal as whether \"an unincorporated association is subject to\n\nthe general personal jurisdiction of every court having jurisdiction\n\nover one of its members\") (internal quotation marks omitted). This is\n\nimportant because, as Donatelli states clearly, the standard for\n\ngeneral    jurisdiction   is    more    strict      than    the    standard   for\n\nspecific    jurisdiction.       Id.    at    463.        General   jurisdiction\n\n\n                                      -32-\n\frequires    that    the    defendant's      activities   in     the    forum   be\n\n\"continuous       and    systematic,\"     United    Elec.,    Radio     &   Mach.\n\nWorkers,    960     F.2d    at   1088,    whereas    specific    jurisdiction\n\nrequires a lesser showing.\n\n            The problem Donatelli addresses is, in some ways, more\n\nlikely to occur in general jurisdiction cases.                        In general\n\njurisdiction cases, the suit does not arise out of or relate to\n\nthe defendant's forum contacts.               Helicopteros Nacionales de\n\nColombia, S.A. v. Hall, 466 U.S. 408, 414 n.9 (1984).                  Donatelli\n\naddresses     the       potentially      unjust    scenario     in     which   an\n\nassociation, with no direct contacts with a forum, is haled into\n\na forum based on one of its members' continuous and systematic\n\nactivities in the forum, to answer a lawsuit unrelated to either\n\nthe member's or the association's in-forum activities.                  893 F.2d\n\nat 469.     Something more is needed to say that the association\n\nhas purposefully availed itself of the benefits of in-forum\n\nactivity.     Otherwise, the association is subject to a suit in\n\nthat forum, unrelated to anything the association has done in\n\nthe forum, by merely engaging in a limited relationship with a\n\nmember, that through its own activities engages in continuous\n\nand systematic activities in a forum.\n\n                                      -33-\n\f           Donatelli resolves this problem by holding that, in\n\ngeneral jurisdiction cases, the association must \"exercise[ ]\n\nsubstantial influence over the member's decision to carry on the\n\nin-forum   activities      which   constitute      the   relevant   'minimum\n\ncontacts.'\"     Id.     This requirement ensures that the association\n\npurposefully     availed    itself   of     the   benefits   of   the   forum,\n\nbecause    it   links    the   member's     in-forum     activity   with   the\n\nassociation's relationship with that member.\n\n           This problem, however, is less likely to arise in\n\nspecific jurisdiction cases such as this one.                 Here a direct\n\nconnection is alleged between the in-forum activities of the\n\nagent (the Motley defendants) and the agent's relationship with\n\nthe principal (the Scruggs defendants).                  When the cause of\n\naction relates to both the association's activities giving rise\n\nto the suit and to the member's in-forum activities, the same\n\nrisk of unfairness is not necessarily present.               In the present\n\ncase, Daynard's suit relates to the Scruggs defendants' alleged\n\npromise to pay him a share of the fees and to the                       Motley\n\ndefendants' activities in Massachusetts, claimed to have been\n\nratified by Scruggs.           Donatelli is not controlling in this\n\ncontext.    It addresses a question different from the inquiry\n\n                                     -34-\n\fhere, which is whether there was an agency relationship between\n\nthe defendants and whether the Scruggs defendants ratified the\n\nMotley defendants' activities in Massachusetts giving rise to\n\nDaynard's suit.\n\n            But that does not end the matter.           We must still\n\ndetermine    whether   the   relationship   between    the   defendants\n\npermits imputing a sufficient quantum of the Motley defendants'\n\nconnections to the Scruggs defendants.\n\n            2. Implied agency and ratification.\n\n            For purposes of personal jurisdiction, the actions of\n\nan agent may be attributed to the principal.8         Whether or not an\n\nagent is initially authorized to act on behalf of a principal,\n\nthe agent's actions may be attributed to the principal, for\n\n\n    8     See Burger King, 471 U.S. at 480 n.22 (stating that\ncommercial activities carried out on a party's behalf \"may\nsometimes be ascribed to the party,\" but declining to \"resolve\nthe permissible bounds of such attribution\"); Grand Entm't\nGroup, Ltd. v. Star Media Sales, Inc., 988 F.2d 476, 483 (3d\nCir. 1993) (stating that \"[a]ctivities of a party's agent may\ncount toward the minimum contacts necessary to support\njurisdiction\"); Sher v. Johnson, 911 F.2d 1357, 1362 (9th Cir.\n1990) (stating that the actions of an agent are attributed to\nthe principal for personal jurisdiction purposes); see also\nDonatelli, 893 F.2d at 466 (noting the general rule that\n\"jurisdiction over a partner confers jurisdiction over the\npartnership\"); Lewis v. Fresne, 252 F.3d 352, 359 (5th Cir.\n2001) (same).\n\n                                 -35-\n\fpurposes   of   personal   jurisdiction,    if   the    principal   later\n\nratifies the agent's conduct.       Myers v. Bennett Law Offices, 238\n\nF.3d 1068, 1073 (9th Cir. 2001); Wessels, Arnold & Henderson v.\n\nNat'l Med. Waste, Inc., 65 F.3d 1427, 1433 (8th Cir. 1995)\n\n(attributing contacts where principal \"supported, accepted, and\n\nfollowed   through   on    the   efforts   initiated\"    by   the   agent,\n\nregardless of whether the agent had authority to act on the\n\nprincipal's behalf).       First, we address whether the defendants\n\nwere in any sort of agency relationship. Second, we discuss\n\nwhether the Scruggs defendants initially authorized, or later\n\nratified, the Motley defendants' actions.\n\n           We disagree with the district court's conclusion that\n\n\"the defendants were not in any sort of agency relationship.\"\n\nDaynard, 184 F. Supp. 2d at 74; see also id. at 76.           Traditional\n\ncommon law concepts support the conclusion that the Scruggs\n\ndefendants' relationship with the Motley defendants suffices to\n\nbring the parties within the rule that permits imputation of\n\ncontacts for jurisdictional purposes.\n\n           Section 16 of the Uniform Partnership Act, which is codified\n\nin the laws of Massachusetts, Mississippi, and South Carolina,\n\nrecognizes the common law doctrine of partnership by estoppel --\n\n                                   -36-\n\for, in this case, joint venture by estoppel.    Unif. P'ship Act §\n\n16(1), 6 U.L.A. 125, 501 (1995); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 108A, § 16\n\n(2000); Miss. Code Ann. § 79-12-31 (2001); S.C. Code Ann. § 33-\n\n41-380 (2001).   The Uniform Partnership Act states:\n\n         When a person . . . represents himself, or consents to\n         another representing him to any one, as a partner . . . he\n         is liable to any such person to whom such representation has\n         been made, who has, on the faith of such representation,\n         given credit to the actual or apparent partnership, and if\n         he has made such representation or consented to its being\n         made in a public manner he is liable to such person, whether\n         the representation has or has not been made or communicated\n         to such person so giving credit by or with the knowledge of\n         the apparent partner making the representation or consenting\n         to its being made.\n\nUnif. P'ship Act, supra, § 16(1); see also Standard Oil Co. v.\n\nHenderson, 265 Mass. 322, 163 N.E. 743, 745 (1928) (stating the\n\ncommon law doctrine of partnership by estoppel).\n\n         Partnerships and joint ventures aside, a theory of\n\nagency by estoppel is similarly availing to Daynard.      Under the\n\nRestatement (Second) of Agency,\n\n         [a] person who is not otherwise liable as a party to\n         a transaction purported to be done on his account, is\n         nevertheless subject to liability to persons who have\n         changed their positions because of their belief that\n         the transaction was entered into by or for him, if\n\n         (a)     he intentionally     or   carelessly   caused   such\n                 belief, or\n\n         (b)     knowing of such belief and that others might\n\n                               -37-\n\f                     change their positions because of it, he did\n                     not take reasonable steps to notify them of the\n                     facts.\n\nRestatement       (Second)   of    Agency    §   8B   (1958);       accord   H.G.\n\nReuschlein & W.A. Gregory, The Law of Agency and Partnership §\n\n25, at 65-66 (2d ed. 1990) (noting that \"[c]onduct which leads\n\na third party to believe that the agent has authority and thus\n\ncreates apparent authority to those persons who act upon it,\n\nfrequently causes the principal to be liable to those who have\n\nchanged their position in reliance to their detriment\"); L.\n\nLakin & M. Schiff, The Law of Agency 38 (1984) (stating an\n\n\"equitable principle of agency by estoppel\" similar to that of\n\nthe Restatement (Second)).\n\n            Even if the defendants' relationship were to fall\n\nslightly outside of the confines of these specific doctrines,\n\nthe question before us is whether a sufficient relationship\n\nexists under the Due Process Clause to permit the exercise of\n\njurisdiction, not whether a partnership, joint venture, or other\n\nparticular    agency      relationship      between     the   two    defendants\n\nexists.     We think it consistent with the Due Process Clause to\n\nattribute    to    the   Scruggs   defendants     the    Motley     defendants'\n\nretention of, and certain interactions with, Daynard where, as\n\n                                     -38-\n\fDaynard alleges, they have led Daynard and the public to believe\n\nthey were joint venturers.                     That is a different issue from\n\nwhether, in a dispute between the two firms, a joint venture\n\nagreement could be enforced.\n\n             We take the facts alleged and produced by Daynard in\n\nthe light most favorable to his jurisdictional assertion.                              Even\n\nif the parties were not joint venturers, they held themselves\n\nout to Daynard to be part of a joint venture or other agency\n\nrelationship        and        are     subject,       for   personal       jurisdiction\n\npurposes, to the doctrine of estoppel.                      Daynard, throughout his\n\ndealings     with    the       defendants,          understood     them   to   be     joint\n\nventurers.     He says the parties \"consistently purported to be\n\njoint    venturers\"        and        that     he    reasonably     relied       on    this\n\nunderstanding.       The question is whether he had a basis for this\n\nbelief   grounded         in    the     Scruggs      defendants'     own    conduct      or\n\nconduct undertaken with their consent.\n\n             In support of his understanding, Daynard states that\n\nhe believed the firms to be in a joint venture based on their\n\nstatements and conduct.                Daynard states that Patrick was acting\n\nfor   both   firms    when           Patrick    retained     him    and   that    Patrick\n\nretained him to advance the objectives of the joint venture.                             He\n\n                                             -39-\n\fsays that during this first meeting, Patrick described the\n\ntobacco litigation as stemming from a meeting between Scruggs\n\nand the Mississippi attorney general, which then resulted in\n\nScruggs \"br[inging] the Motley firm into their plans.\"\n\n          Daynard supports his claim with documentary evidence\n\nof a joint venture that he unearthed through jurisdictional\n\ndiscovery.      Around October 1994, the Scruggs defendants entered\n\ninto a \"Joint Venture Agreement\" with several firms to pursue\n\ntobacco litigation on behalf of the state of Mississippi.                 The\n\nMotley defendants claim to have abided by this agreement and\n\ntheir firm's name was listed on the agreement, although they\n\nnever signed the agreement.         In a letter from Joseph Rice of\n\nNess   Motley    to   Richard   Scruggs,    Rice   stated:    \"As   we   have\n\ndiscussed several times, we have not signed the Mississippi\n\nJoint Venture Agreement solely because we don't want to be\n\ngoverned by Mississippi Tax Law.           We are agreeable to all terms\n\nin the agreement and, as you know, we have acted under the\n\nagreement from the beginning.\"        In the agreement, Ness Motley\n\nfirm members, including Mr. Motley, were listed as members of\n\nseveral of the \"teams\" and \"committees\" forming the \"Litigation\n\nManagement Structure\" outlined in the agreement.             Mr. Motley was\n\n                                   -40-\n\fa   co-chairman    of    the   \"Public   Relations   Team,\"    which   also\n\nincluded Steve Bozeman from Scruggs Millette.                 Indeed, Ness\n\nMotley was counsel of record in the Mississippi case.                    In\n\naddition, Daynard notes that \"the two defendant firms were\n\nparties to a 'Resolution' which recited that they had both 'made\n\nand   entered     into    that   certain    Joint    Venture    Agreement'\n\nconcerning the Mississippi litigation.\"\n\n          Scruggs says that Ness Motley did not sign the joint\n\nventure agreement, that Ness Motley did not perform under the\n\nagreement's terms, and that the litigation team did not function\n\nas outlined in the agreement.        He says Ness Motley did not make\n\nthe capital contributions specified in the agreement, that there\n\nwas a distinction between being counsel of record and being a\n\nparty to the joint venture agreement, and that Ness Motley's\n\nfailure to sign the agreement caused \"great concern.\"              Scruggs\n\nsays that, upon receiving the letter from Rice, stating that\n\nNess Motley had \"acted under the agreement from the beginning,\"\n\nhe called Rice and told him that \"this wasn't good enough\" and\n\nthat \"nobody else\" considered Ness Motley to have performed\n\nunder the agreement.\n\n          Scruggs concedes, however, that the profits from the\n\n                                    -41-\n\fMississippi        litigation,     outlined   in    this     agreement,        were\n\neventually     divided      with   Ness   Motley,   but     he   says   that    the\n\ndivision was under the terms of a 1999 agreement.                        Scruggs\n\nstates that his \"understanding with Ness Motley was always that\n\nat the end of the day, we would attempt to negotiate a fee and\n\nexpense sharing arrangement, each trusting the goodwill of the\n\nother   to    reach     a   successful    negotiation,       but   without      any\n\nguarantee that we would.\"             In addition, Scruggs admits that\n\n\"[t]here     was    a   general    cooperative     effort    between    [Scruggs\n\nMillette and Ness Motley] to advance litigation against the\n\ntobacco industry.\"\n\n             Daynard then says that after Motley hired him, he began\n\na course of dealing with the defendants in which he provided\n\nboth firms with legal advice, including advice to members of the\n\nScruggs firm physically present in Boston, as well as assistance\n\nprovided from Boston by phone and fax.                    Daynard also cites\n\nseveral conversations with both Scruggs and Motley in which they\n\nagreed to pay him a share of the fees obtained by both firms,\n\nScruggs's statement that Scruggs had at least apparent authority\n\nto promise the 5%, and Motley's statement that he would be\n\ncompensated as part of the \"team.\"\n\n                                      -42-\n\f           Daynard    cites     a    popular     book   about    the     tobacco\n\nlitigation, which he says describes Ness Motley and Scruggs\n\nMillette as joint venturers beginning in 1993, as evidence that\n\nthe firms were engaged in a well publicized joint venture or at\n\nleast held themselves out to be so engaged.                      See M. Orey,\n\nAssuming the Risk: The Mavericks, the Lawyers, and the Whistle-\n\nBlowers Who Beat Big Tobacco 265 (1999) (stating that Scruggs,\n\nMotley,   and   two   others,       were   the   \"nucleus\"      of   a   tobacco\n\nlitigation \"team,\" which \"drafted a joint-venture agreement that\n\nspelled out in elaborate detail the duties each of the lawyers\n\nwould perform\").      He notes, as additional evidence of public\n\nperception, that in the Texas tobacco litigation, other lawyers\n\nsent the firms checks made payable to \"Ness Motley/Scruggs.\"                    At\n\nleast four such checks appear in the record.\n\n           Finally, in support of his claim that the defendants\n\nheld themselves out to be joint venturers, Daynard presents a\n\n1998 letter to Hawaii's attorney general, from Joseph Rice of\n\nNess Motley, stating that \"Ness, Motley has an arrangement with\n\nRichard Scruggs to work jointly on all of the state cases\n\nagainst   the   Tobacco   Industry.\"         Noting     that   \"[w]e     have   no\n\nformal, written agreement,\" he said \"Ness, Motley and Dick\n\n                                      -43-\n\fScruggs have been doing business together for almost ten years\n\nand have never had any differences.         We fully anticipate sitting\n\ndown in hindsight and determining what the division of any\n\nrecoveries would be between the two law firms.\"\n\n           Scruggs said that he considered Rice's statement that\n\n\"Ness, Motley has an arrangement with Richard Scruggs to work\n\njointly on all of the state cases against the Tobacco Industry\"\n\nto be \"a bit of an overstatement.\"           On the other hand, Rice's\n\nletter to Hawaii's attorney general said \"I am sending a copy of\n\nthis letter to Dick so he may respond likewise, if he has any\n\nquestions or any additions.\"     Scruggs did not write anything to\n\ncontradict   Rice's    characterization        and    stated,   in    his\n\ndeposition, that \"[t]here was no reason to contradict it.\"\n\nScruggs conceded that \"[t]here was a general cooperative effort\n\nbetween [Scruggs Millette and Ness Motley] to advance litigation\n\nagainst the tobacco industry.\" Although this letter may not go\n\nto   Daynard's   understanding   of   the    firms'   relationship,   and\n\nalthough it was written by Rice of Ness Motley, not by any of\n\nthe Scruggs defendants, Scruggs's silence carries at least some\n\nweight.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -44-\n\f          The facts as alleged by Daynard are sufficient to make\n\nthe jurisdictional showing that, in Boston, Patrick of Ness\n\nMotley hired Daynard, that Daynard reasonably understood Patrick\n\nto be acting on behalf of a joint venture or other agency\n\nrelationship between Ness Motley and Scruggs Millette, and that\n\nDaynard relied on this understanding by providing his services\n\nto both defendants.\n\n          Many of these same facts support the conclusion that\n\nthe   Scruggs   defendants   subsequently   ratified   the   Motley\n\ndefendants' conduct.    Even if Patrick, when he hired Daynard,\n\nwas acting without actual authority from the Scruggs defendants,\n\nDaynard says Patrick purported to act as an agent for both firms\n\nwhen Patrick retained Daynard, and that Scruggs effectively\n\nratified that representation.\n\n          \"A person may ratify a prior act done by another without\n\nactual or apparent authority. . . . by . . . conduct that is\n\njustifiable only on the assumption that the person so consents.\"\n\nRestatement (Third) of Agency § 4.01 (Tentative Draft No. 2, 2001).9\n\n\n      9   As described in the Restatement (Second), \"Ratification\nis the affirmance by a person of a prior act which did not bind\nhim but which was done or professedly done on his account,\nwhereby the act, as to some or all persons, is given effect as\nif originally authorized by him.\"       Restatement (Second) of\n\n                                -45-\n\f\"The sole requirement for ratification is a manifestation of assent or\n\nother conduct indicative of consent by the principal.\" Restatement\n\n(Third) of Agency, supra, § 4.01, cmt. b; see also Inn Foods, Inc. v.\n\nEquitable Coop. Bank, 45 F.3d 594, 597 (1st Cir. 1995) (stating that\n\n\"[u]nder Massachusetts law, ratification of an agent's acts may be\n\nexpress or implied\").          The Scruggs defendants, on the facts\n\nalleged, engaged in such conduct.\n\n           After Ness Motley retained Daynard, and as a result of\n\nthis   employment,   Daynard      asserts    that   he   began     providing\n\ninformation directly to the Scruggs defendants.                 Daynard says\n\nthat he \"communicated regularly\" with the Scruggs defendants,\n\nthat they came to Boston to receive his advice, and that he \"had\n\nmany   conversations,     meetings     and   written   communications      in\n\nBoston   with   members   of    the   defendant   firms,   in    which   [he]\n\nprovided advice and undertook specific projects for their use in\n\nthe tobacco litigation.\"        Even if the Scruggs defendants did not\n\ncome to Boston, we think there is adequate other evidence of\n\nratification, accepting Daynard's allegations.\n\n           Daynard says that he had \"several conversations\" with\n\n\"both Mr. Motley and Mr. Scruggs in which they stated that they\n\n\n\nAgency, supra, § 82.\n\n                                      -46-\n\fwould appropriately compensate [Daynard] . . . and that the\n\nfinal form of compensation would be\" in the form of a share of\n\nthe fees the firms obtained from handling the state tobacco\n\nlitigation.    Daynard says Ronald Motley advised him that he\n\nwould be compensated for his assistance as a member of the Ness\n\nMotley \"team.\" Further evidence of ratification comes from Daynard's\n\nversion of the Chicago meeting, where Scruggs said he acted with at\n\nleast apparent authority for both firms and reached an agreement.\n\nDaynard says that Scruggs shook hands on a deal to pay him 5% of these\n\nfees. These assurances and reassurances that Daynard would be paid a\n\nportion of the recovered fees were an integral part of the ongoing\n\nrelationship existing between Daynard, the Motley defendants, and the\n\nScruggs defendants.\n\n          Finally, Daynard asserts that in reliance on his arrangements\n\nwith the Scruggs defendants and at their request, he had to commit out-\n\nof-pocket expenses of $15,000 to retain someone to meet his teaching\n\nobligations. Again, there is no evidence that Scruggs disavowed any\n\ncontractual relationship as he accepted Daynard's assistance. To be\n\nsure, Scruggs says Daynard was a volunteer, but reasonable inferences\n\nsupport Daynard's version.\n\n          The Scruggs defendants had many opportunities to disavow a\n\nrelationship with Daynard or to clarify the relationship. For example,\n\n\n\n                                 -47-\n\fthey could have rejected his assistance or accepted it only on certain\n\nconditions. Instead, according to Daynard, they repeatedly encouraged\n\nand accepted his assistance and during several conversations agreed to\n\npay him in the form of a share of the fees generated. When Daynard\n\nwrote his first letter to Scruggs in July 1997 confirming the\n\nfee arrangement, Scruggs remained silent.10\n\n          By knowingly accepting the benefits of the transaction\n\ninitiated in Massachusetts, the Scruggs defendants ratified Patrick's\n\nact of hiring and retaining Daynard on behalf of both firms, which\n\nultimately gave rise to this law suit. See Inn Foods, 45 F.3d at 597\n\nn.7 (noting that \"benefits received are certainly strong evidence that\n\nthe principal acquiesced in the agent's transaction\"); Restatement\n\n(Third) of Agency, supra, § 4.01, cmt. d. In addition, by repeatedly\n\nagreeing to compensate Daynard for ongoing work conducted in\n\nMassachusetts, agreeing to pay Daynard a share of the fees and later\n\nshaking hands on the 5% figure, and accepting his coming from Boston to\n\nMississippi to assist at trial, Scruggs, acting on behalf of his firm\n\n\n\n     10    It was not until November 1997, after Daynard had provided\nyears of services and the firms were expecting to reap significant\nfinancial rewards from at least the Mississippi and Florida litigation,\nthat Scruggs responded to Daynard's second letter, after he\nignored the first letter, and disavowed the 5% fee arrangement.\nDaynard asserts that, even at this point, Scruggs disputed only\nthe extent of Daynard's compliance with the agreement, not the\nexistence of the agreement.\n\n                                 -48-\n\fand, according to Daynard, the Ness Motley firm as well, ratified the\n\narrangement in which the Motley defendants agreed to pay Daynard for\n\nhis ongoing services as a member of the team.\n\nD. The Remaining Constitutional Analysis\n\n           The   easier    question      in   the   case    is   the    remaining\n\nconstitutional    one.         Given    the   Scruggs      defendants'     direct\n\ncontacts with Massachusetts and their contacts imputed from the\n\nMotley   defendants,      do   the     Scruggs   defendants      have   \"minimum\n\ncontacts\" with Massachusetts \"such that the maintenance of the\n\nsuit does not offend 'traditional notions of fair play and\n\nsubstantial justice.'\"?         Int'l Shoe, 326 U.S. at 316 (quoting\n\nMilliken, 311 U.S. at 463).            The answer is yes.\n\n           For specific jurisdiction, this circuit divides the\n\nconstitutional    analysis       into    three   categories:      relatedness,\n\npurposeful availment, and reasonableness:\n\n           First, the claim underlying the litigation must\n           directly arise out of, or relate to, the defendant's\n           forum-state activities. Second, the defendant's in-\n           state contacts must represent a purposeful availment\n           of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum\n           state, thereby invoking the benefits and protections\n           of that state's laws and making the defendant's\n           involuntary presence before the state's courts\n           foreseeable.    Third, the exercise of jurisdiction\n           must, in light of the Gestalt factors, be reasonable.\n\n\n\n                                       -49-\n\fFoster-Miller, 46 F.3d at 144; see also Noonan, 135 F.3d at 90.\n\nThe Supreme Court, speaking on the subject of specific personal\n\njurisdiction in contract cases, has \"emphasized that parties who\n\n'reach out beyond one state and create continuing relationships\n\nand obligations with citizens of another state' are subject to\n\nregulation and sanctions in the other State for the consequences\n\nof their activities.\"   Burger King, 471 U.S. at 473 (quoting\n\nTravelers Health Ass'n v. Virginia, 339 U.S. 643, 647 (1950)).\n\n\n\n\n          1. Relatedness.\n\n          As to the first requirement, that \"the claim underlying\n\nthe litigation must directly arise out of, or relate to, the\n\ndefendant's forum-state activities,\" Foster-Miller, 46 F.3d at\n\n144, the district court correctly concluded, based merely on the\n\nScruggs defendants' direct contacts with the forum, that the\n\nalleged\n\n          breach of contract in this case \"arose\" from a course\n          of dealing between the parties. The contract was in\n          the form of a working relationship -- started in\n          Massachusetts -- that called for interaction between\n          Massachusetts,  South   Carolina,  and   Mississippi.\n          Drawing all inferences in favor of Daynard, he\n          arguably meets the relatedness requirement,\n\n\n\n\n                              -50-\n\fDaynard, 184 F. Supp. 2d at 66.            It is clear that    Daynard's\n\nbreach of contract claim \"arise[s] out of, or relate[s] to,\" the\n\nScruggs defendants' Massachusetts activities.         Foster-Miller, 46\n\nF.3d at 144.      Daynard's lawsuit is based on his claim that the\n\ndefendants owe him money for his work pursuant to an agreement\n\ninitiated    by     the   defendants   while    physically    present     in\n\nMassachusetts and performed, in part, in Massachusetts.                 This\n\nrelationship contemplated ongoing interaction between Daynard,\n\nin Massachusetts, and the defendants, in Mississippi and South\n\nCarolina.     Daynard's suit arises out of these Massachusetts\n\nactivities, which were instrumental to the formation of the\n\ndisputed oral contract.         See McGee v. Int'l Life Ins. Co., 355\n\nU.S. 220, 223 (1957) (upholding jurisdiction over a suit \"based\n\non   a   contract   which   had   substantial   connection    with   th[e]\n\nState\"); Hahn v. Vt. Law Sch., 698 F.2d 48, 51-52 (1st Cir.\n\n1983).\n\n            2. Purposeful availment.\n\n            \"Second,      the   defendant's    in-state   contacts   must\n\nrepresent a purposeful availment of the privilege of conducting\n\nactivities in the forum state, thereby invoking the benefits and\n\nprotections of that state's laws and making the defendant's\n\n                                    -51-\n\finvoluntary presence before the state's courts foreseeable.\"\n\nFoster-Miller, 46 F.3d at 144. \"The cornerstones upon which the\n\nconcept of purposeful availment rest[s] are voluntariness and\n\nforeseeability.\"        Sawtelle,     70   F.3d    at    1391   (citing\n\nTicketmaster, 26 F.3d at 207).\n\n           The district court's reasoning on purposeful availment\n\nconsidered only the Scruggs defendants' direct contacts and\n\nfound them insufficient.    We need not address this conclusion as\n\nDaynard has not challenged it on appeal.           We note, however,\n\nthat, as the district court recognized, Scruggs did have some\n\ncontacts   with   Massachusetts,    however   minimal.    The   Scruggs\n\ndefendants, according to Daynard, engaged in telephone and fax\n\ncommunications with him in Massachusetts.11       In addition, Daynard\n\nsays the Scruggs defendants also had conversations with him, in\n\nwhich they agreed to pay him a share of the fees as compensation\n\n\n\n\n     11   \"The transmission of facts or information into\nMassachusetts via telephone or mail would of course constitute\nevidence of a jurisdictional contact directed into the forum\nstate.\" Mass Sch. of Law, 142 F.3d at 36; see also Burger King,\n471 U.S. at 476 (stating that \"it is an inescapable fact of\nmodern commercial life that a substantial amount of business is\ntransacted solely by mail and wire communications across state\nlines\" and that defendants may not defeat jurisdiction merely by\nshowing that they never physically entered the forum).\n\n                                   -52-\n\ffor work performed in Massachusetts.            He also says that Scruggs\n\nfirm members came to Boston to receive his advice, although\n\nScruggs denies this.\n\n            Combined     with    Patrick's       physical    presence    in\n\nMassachusetts to negotiate the agreement which ultimately gave\n\nrise to this litigation, and the ongoing relationship between\n\nthe Motley defendants and Daynard -- properly attributed to the\n\nScruggs defendants -- we can properly say that the Scruggs\n\ndefendants \"engaged in . . . purposeful activity related to the\n\nforum that would make the exercise of jurisdiction fair, just,\n\nor reasonable,\" Rush v. Savchuk, 444 U.S. 320, 329 (1980).               See\n\nBurger King, 471 U.S. at 479 (holding that \"prior negotiations\n\nand contemplated future consequences, along with the terms of\n\nthe contract and the parties' actual course of dealing\" must be\n\nevaluated    to   determine     whether   the    defendant   purposefully\n\nestablished    minimum    contacts).      Patrick's     action   alone    is\n\nprobably sufficient to support jurisdiction over the Motley\n\ndefendants and, when imputed, the Scruggs defendants as well.\n\nSee id. at 475 n.18 (noting that \"[s]o long as it creates a\n\n'substantial connection' with the forum, even a single act can\n\nsupport jurisdiction\") (quoting McGee, 355 U.S. at 223); R.C.\n\n                                   -53-\n\fCasad     &    W.B.    Richman,       1    Jurisdiction       in   Civil   Actions:\n\nTerritorial Basis and Process Limitations on Jurisdiction of\n\nState and Federal Courts § 4-2, at 413 (3d ed. 1998) (stating\n\nthat \"if the defendant or its agent was physically present in\n\nthe state to negotiate the service contract, cases have found\n\nthat the defendant transacted business there\").                      Even in cases\n\nwhere the defendant was not physically present in the forum,\n\nwhere the defendant initiated the transaction by mailing or\n\ncalling       the   plaintiff    in       the   forum   and   when   the   defendant\n\ncontemplated that the plaintiff would render services in the\n\nforum, all as alleged by Daynard here, many courts have found\n\njurisdiction.         Casad & Richman, supra, § 4-2, at 414.\n\n               3. Reasonableness.\n\n               \"Third, the exercise of jurisdiction must, in light of\n\nthe Gestalt factors, be reasonable.\"                    Foster-Miller, 46 F.3d at\n\n144; see also World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S.\n\n286, 292 (1980) (listing factors).                 The Gestalt factors support\n\nthe conclusion that jurisdiction is reasonable.\n\n               The burden on the Scruggs defendants of appearing in\n\nMassachusetts,        given     that      they    routinely    represent    clients\n\noutside their home state, is not by any means unusual. In\n\n                                           -54-\n\faddition, Daynard's interest in bringing his action in this\n\nforum, given the traditional deference accorded to a plaintiff's\n\nchoice of forum, weighs in favor of personal jurisdiction.                       This\n\nis particularly true in light of Massachusetts's stake in being\n\nable \"to provide a convenient forum for its residents to redress\n\ninjuries inflicted by out-of-forum actors.\"                 Sawtelle, 70 F.3d\n\nat 1395.    Massachusetts's adjudicatory interest is likely to\n\nweigh in favor of exercising personal jurisdiction because the\n\ndistrict court has already decided that, as between Daynard and\n\nthe Motley defendants, Massachusetts law governs the dispute\n\nover the oral fee-splitting arrangement.                 Daynard, 188 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 118-23.         Finally, efficient administration of justice\n\nfavors   jurisdiction      in    Massachusetts,         where    this    action   is\n\nalready proceeding against the Motley defendants.\n\nE. Conclusion\n\n           We   conclude       that   the     Scruggs    defendants'      contacts\n\nproperly   imputed      from    the     Motley    defendants,          against    the\n\nbackdrop   of   the    Scruggs        defendants'       direct    contacts       with\n\nMassachusetts, constitute \"minimum contacts\" with Massachusetts\n\n\"such    that   the    maintenance       of    the   suit       does    not   offend\n\n'traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.'\"\n\n                                       -55-\n\fInt'l Shoe, 326 U.S. at 316 (quoting Milliken, 311 U.S. at 463).\n\nAgain, we emphasize that we reach this conclusion under the\n\nprima    facie    approach,     taking   Daynard's    properly   documented\n\nevidentiary proffers \"as true (whether or not disputed) and\n\nconstru[ing] them in the light most congenial to [Daynard's]\n\njurisdictional claim.\"           Mass. Sch. of Law, 142 F.3d at 34.\n\nNothing in the opinion precludes the Scruggs defendants, in the\n\nprospective district court proceedings, from challenging these\n\nfacts,    if     they   wish,    and     renewing    their   jurisdictional\n\nchallenge, if appropriate.\n\n                                       III.\n\n           For these reasons, we reverse the dismissal of the\n\nScruggs defendants for lack of personal jurisdiction and remand\n\nto the district court for further proceedings consistent with\n\nthis opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -56-\n\f",

Daynard,\n\na   Massachusetts   law    professor,      for   fees    in    the   tobacco\n\nlitigation,   against     the    Mississippi     law    firm   of    Scruggs,\n\nMillette, Bozeman & Dent, and Richard Scruggs, a senior partner\n\n(\"Scruggs defendants\").         At the heart of Daynard's claim is the\n\nargument that the court may reach the Scruggs defendants based\n\nin large part on contacts imputed from the South Carolina law\n\nfirm of Ness, Motley, Loadholt, Richardson & Poole, and Ronald\n\nMotley (\"Motley defendants\"), all of whom purportedly acted on\n\nbehalf of both firms in engaging Daynard to work on litigation\n\nagainst the tobacco industry.          We conclude, contrary to the\n\ndistrict court, that the Scruggs defendants are subject to\n\nspecific personal jurisdiction based on their contacts with\n\nMassachusetts, particularly those contacts properly attributed\n\nto them from the Motley defendants, who are also defendants in\n\nthis litigation.\n\n          Daynard is a law professor at Northeastern University\n\nspecializing in litigation against the tobacco industry.                   He\n\nsued the Motley and Scruggs defendants, claiming that, pursuant\n\n                                     -2-\n\fto an oral agreement, he is entitled to a portion of the fees\n\nthat   these   firms    have    received   or   will   receive    from   their\n\nsuccessful tobacco litigation.\n\n           The Motley defendants, based on their Massachusetts\n\ncontacts, concede personal jurisdiction, but, central to this\n\ncase, the Scruggs defendants do not.            Daynard does not challenge\n\nthe district court's conclusion that the Scruggs defendants' own\n\ndirect   contacts       with    Massachusetts      are,   by     themselves,\n\ninsufficient    to     permit   personal   jurisdiction.         Instead,    he\n\nchallenges     the      district    court's      ruling    that     personal\n\njurisdiction does not exist based on the imputation of some of\n\nthe Motley defendants' contacts, which were purportedly made on\n\nbehalf of both law firms, to the Scruggs defendants.                        The\n\ndistrict court reasoned that the Motley defendants were not the\n\nScruggs defendants' agents, and, even if they were, the Scruggs\n\ndefendants did not exert \"substantial influence\" over the Motley\n\ndefendants' in-forum activities.           The district court reasoned\n\nthat it could not, consistent with the Due Process Clause of the\n\nFourteenth Amendment, attribute the Motley defendants' contacts\n\nto the Scruggs defendants for purposes of personal jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f             Daynard appeals this decision arguing that the district\n\ncourt erred by relying on a general jurisdiction case, Donatelli\n\nv.

Daynard argues\n\nthat he need not show, for specific jurisdiction purposes, that\n\nthe Scruggs defendants exerted substantial influence over the\n\nMotley defendants' in-forum activities in order to impute the\n\nMotley defendants' contacts to the Scruggs defendants.            Daynard\n\nasserts that the defendants were engaged in a tobacco litigation\n\njoint venture and that, on this basis, attribution is proper.\n\n             We conclude that Donatelli's substantial influence test\n\nis not controlling in this case, where Daynard alleges that the\n\ndefendants were in a joint venture, or at least held themselves\n\nout to be in a type of agency relationship.                 We need not\n\ndetermine whether the defendants were actually engaged in a\n\njoint   venture    between   themselves,   however.    The     facts,   as\n\nasserted by Daynard and construed in the light of whether he has\n\nmade a prima facie jurisdictional showing, suffice to show a\n\nrelationship between the two defendants sufficient to impute\n\nsome    of   the   Motley    defendants'   contacts   to    the   Scruggs\n\ndefendants.     These same facts show that the Scruggs defendants\n\n                                   -4-\n\fheld themselves out to be in some form of an agency relationship\n\nwith the Motley defendants and, by accepting and encouraging\n\nDaynard's services, and agreeing to compensate him on the basis\n\nof a share of the fees, ratified the Motley defendants' in-forum\n\nactivities giving rise to this lawsuit.\n\n          Traditional common law concepts, embodied in the law\n\nof Massachusetts, Mississippi, and South Carolina, confirm the\n\nfundamental fairness of requiring the Scruggs defendants to\n\nanswer   in   Massachusetts.      We    conclude   that   the   Scruggs\n\ndefendants'   contacts   with   Massachusetts,     particularly   those\n\ncontacts of the Motley defendants properly attributed to the\n\nScruggs defendants, suffice to permit personal jurisdiction over\n\nthe Scruggs defendants consistent with the Massachusetts long-\n\narm statute and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          In this case there are many disputed, and as of yet\n\nunresolved, facts.       We do not resolve these disputed facts\n\nbecause we \"must accept the plaintiff's (properly documented)\n\nevidentiary proffers as true for the purpose of determining the\n\nadequacy of the prima facie jurisdictional showing.\"            Foster-\n\nMiller, Inc. v.

Daynard's Allegations\n\n            Daynard is a resident and citizen of the Commonwealth\n\nof Massachusetts.           He is, and has been for over thirty years, a\n\nlaw professor at Northeastern University School of Law, located\n\nin Massachusetts.           For much of that time, he has focused his\n\nprofessional        and    academic      efforts      on     defeating      the   tobacco\n\nindustry in court.               Daynard is Chair of the Tobacco Product\n\nLiability Project, President of the Tobacco Control Resources\n\nCenter, and a frequent advocate for, and consultant to, those\n\nopposing the tobacco industry.\n\n            For many years there was a consensus that the potential\n\nfor   recovery      against       the    tobacco      industry      was     negligible.\n\nIndeed, the tobacco industry, until 1997, boasted that it had\n\nnever   paid    a    cent    to    a    tort    plaintiff.         As   of    2002,   the\n\nsituation is drastically different.                         Lawyers have sued the\n\ntobacco   companies         on     behalf      of    many    states     and    recovered\n\n                                            -6-\n\fastronomical sums for those states, with consequently large fees\n\nfor themselves.       During the past several years, almost every\n\nstate   has   sued   the   tobacco   industry,   seeking,   among   other\n\nthings, reimbursement for the medical costs incurred as a result\n\nof smoking-related health harms.           The defendant law firms in\n\nthis case have been responsible for instituting, litigating, and\n\nsettling litigation against the tobacco industry on behalf of forty-six\n\ndifferent states. This settlement was accomplished, in part, in what\n\nis known as the Master Settlement Agreement. See National Association\n\nof   Attorneys       General,   Master     Settlement   Agreement,     at\n\nhttp://www.naag.org/tobac/cigmsa.rtf (Nov. 23, 1998); Greenless v.\n\nAlmond, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199790\"><a href=\"/opinion/199790/greenless-v-almond/\"><span class=\"volume\">277</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 603 (1st Cir. 2002) (describing the tobacco\n\nlitigation and settlement). Daynard says this settlement will result\n\nin a distribution of billions of dollars to the two firms.\n\n          Daynard says that his efforts were central to many of these\n\ntitanic recoveries. He quotes reputable authorities stating that\n\nhe is the \"recognized leader\" in tobacco litigation on behalf of\n\nthe public health and the \"foremost authority\" on,          and \"driving\n\nforce\" behind, anti-tobacco legal theory and strategy.          In fact,\n\nDaynard quotes one authority stating that without Daynard's\n\ntobacco work, the state-initiated tobacco litigation would not\n\neven exist.\n\n                                     -7-\n\f           The parties agree that Charles Patrick, then a partner\n\nat Ness Motley, came to Boston, Massachusetts in the fall of\n\n1993 to meet with Daynard.      Daynard says that, at the time\n\nPatrick traveled to Boston to retain his services, Ness Motley\n\nand Scruggs Millette were engaged in a tobacco litigation joint\n\nventure.   Indeed, throughout his dealings with Ness Motley and\n\nScruggs Millette, Daynard understood the two firms to be in a\n\njoint venture that at first encompassed the Mississippi tobacco\n\nlitigation and then broadened to include tobacco litigation\n\nnationwide.   Daynard insists that Patrick was acting on behalf\n\nof both firms and that Patrick retained him to advance the\n\nobjectives of the firms' joint venture.\n\n           Shortly after this initial meeting in Boston, Daynard\n\ntraveled to Ness Motley's South Carolina offices, where he met\n\nwith members of the firm, including Ronald Motley.      At these\n\nmeetings, Daynard identified and explained legal theories for\n\nrecovery on behalf of state governments.   After these meetings,\n\nDaynard continued to communicate regularly, by phone and fax,\n\nwith members of Ness Motley, providing them advice on similar\n\nmatters.\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\f            As    a     result     of    Ness    Motley's       retention      of    him,\n\npurportedly       on    behalf      of   both     firms,       Daynard   also       began\n\n\"communicat[ing]         regularly\"        with    the     Mississippi        law    firm\n\nScruggs   Millette           and   providing      the    firm    with    \"advice      and\n\nassistance.\"          Beginning in the fall of 1993, members of both\n\nfirms came to Boston to meet with and receive advice from\n\nDaynard, in furtherance of his engagement by them.1                           According\n\nto his affidavit, Daynard \"had many conversations, meetings and\n\nwritten communications in Boston with members of the defendant\n\nfirms, in which [he] provided advice and undertook specific\n\nprojects for their use in the tobacco litigation.\"\n\n            Daynard asserts that his legal theories, strategies,\n\nevidence,     and       arguments        \"subsequently          formed    a     central\n\ncomponent\" of the firms' litigation brought on behalf of several\n\nstates against the tobacco industry.                          In addition, Daynard\n\nintroduced       Ness    Motley     firm   members       to    experienced     tobacco\n\nlitigators       and    to    pleading     and    discovery      files   from       other\n\ntobacco cases.\n\n\n\n\n     1    Scruggs denies that he participated in any such meeting\nin Boston for these purposes.\n\n                                           -9-\n\f            Initially, Ness Motley compensated Daynard based on\n\nhourly   fees   for   his   services   rendered.     As   Daynard's\n\nrelationship with the two firms progressed, he had \"several\n\nconversations\" with \"both Mr. Motley and Mr. Scruggs in which\n\nthey stated that they would appropriately compensate [Daynard]\n\n. . . and that the final form of compensation would be\" in the\n\nform of a share of the fees the firms obtained from handling the\n\nstates' tobacco litigation.    Ronald Motley advised Daynard that\n\nhe would be compensated for his assistance as a member of the\n\nNess Motley \"team.\"   After this communication, Daynard says that\n\nhe received no further compensation from Ness Motley.        As to\n\npayment by Scruggs Millette, the parties agree that Scruggs\n\nMillette never compensated Daynard.\n\n            When the state tobacco litigation commenced, Daynard\n\ncontinued to work with both firms, educating their attorneys on\n\nthe relevant issues, counseling them based on his experience in\n\nother tobacco litigation, providing them with relevant documents\n\nand information, and introducing them to potential witnesses and\n\ncontacts.     He developed litigation strategies and worked on\n\npleadings and other documents for the firms.         Many of these\n\nservices were performed in Boston.     See Daynard v. Ness, Motley,\n\n                                -10-\n\fLoadholt, Richardson & Poole, P.A., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2577063\"><a href=\"/opinion/2577063/daynard-v-ness-motley-loadholt-richardson/\"><span class=\"volume\">188</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Daynard\n\nalso spoke at conferences of state governmental officials where\n\nhe arranged for Ness Motley and Scruggs Millette to participate,\n\nthereby advancing their ongoing litigation and providing them\n\nwith legitimacy in the eyes of potential state clients.\n\n          Ness Motley recognized and encouraged Daynard's efforts\n\nby   assigning   him    specific     projects,    by     requesting      his\n\ninformation and assistance, by transporting him to selected\n\nmeetings and proceedings, and by accepting his work product.              At\n\nsome point in 1996, when Daynard became concerned that some Ness\n\nMotley   attorneys   were   trying     to   minimize   his   role   in   the\n\nlitigation, Mr. Motley assured Daynard that this was not the\n\ncase.\n\n          In July of 1996, when Daynard reported to Ness Motley\n\non the time he had expended to complete a research project that\n\nNess Motley had requested, the firm, consistent with its own and\n\nthe Scruggs defendants' past assurances, informed Daynard that\n\nit would compensate him for his work by paying him a share of\n\n                                   -11-\n\fthe   fees    generated    if    the    litigation     was     successful,    an\n\narrangement to which Daynard agreed.                 As a result of this\n\npromise, Daynard ceased submitting descriptions of his hourly\n\nwork and requests for payment to Ness Motley.\n\n             Daynard says that, at a meeting in late August of 1996,\n\nScruggs Millette and Ness Motley \"confirmed\" their agreement to\n\ncompensate him in the form of a share of the fees.                On August 25\n\nthrough August 27, 1996, Daynard, Motley, and Scruggs were in\n\nChicago, Illinois, participating in meetings related to the\n\nstate   tobacco    litigation.         Scruggs   and    Motley    scheduled    a\n\nmeeting with Daynard during that period to discuss Daynard's\n\nspecific share of any fee award.          Although Motley was ultimately\n\nnot   able   to   attend   the   meeting,     Daynard    met    with   Scruggs.\n\nDaynard says he asked Scruggs \"whether he was speaking for both\n\nhimself and Mr. Motley\" and Scruggs stated that he was, that\n\nDaynard could rely on this, and that he was acting with at least\n\n\"apparent authority\" for Motley.          Scruggs promised Daynard 5% of\n\nany fees ultimately recovered, in any state tobacco litigation\n\nin which any of the defendants were counsel, as compensation for\n\nDaynard's past and continuing assistance.                    Daynard says he\n\naccepted the 5% agreement and that he and Scruggs shook hands on\n\n                                       -12-\n\fit.    Based on the conduct of the Scruggs and Motley defendants\n\nduring the course of the tobacco litigation, Daynard says that\n\nhe    reasonably   believed   Scruggs      to   be   acting   with    apparent\n\nauthority for both firms.\n\n           Relying on this 5% figure, and \"ongoing assurances and\n\nrepresentations,\" Daynard continued to work for the two firms.\n\nFor example, Scruggs requested that Daynard be available during\n\nthe trial in the Mississippi litigation and agreed to compensate\n\nDaynard for the cost of paying a substitute teacher to cover his\n\nNortheastern University teaching obligations.            Daynard agreed by\n\ncommitting $15,000 of his own personal funds to buy himself out\n\nof his teaching obligations so that he could be present full-\n\ntime during the trial.\n\n           Almost a year after the alleged handshake on the 5%\n\ncompensation figure, and after the Mississippi state litigation\n\nhad reached a tentative settlement, Daynard wrote a letter to\n\nScruggs confirming the fee arrangement and identifying certain\n\nexpenses    that    Daynard   had    incurred        associated      with   the\n\nMississippi litigation.       Scruggs never responded.         A few months\n\nlater, Daynard wrote another letter, this time to both Scruggs\n\nand Motley, referring to the 5% fee arrangement.              At this point,\n\n                                    -13-\n\fboth firms were expecting to reap significant attorney's fees\n\nfrom   the    Mississippi       settlement    and   also   from    the   Florida\n\nsettlement.        Joseph Rice of Ness Motley and Richard Scruggs both\n\nresponded to this second letter and both disavowed the 5% fee\n\narrangement.         Neither firm has paid Daynard any of the legal\n\nfees it has received to date.             Daynard alleges that the firms\n\nbased their refusal to pay him the 5% on his failure to support\n\ncertain national tobacco liability legislation, a requirement he\n\nsays    the        defendants    never    mentioned        in   any      previous\n\ncommunication.\n\nB. State Court Proceedings, Federal District Court Proceedings,\n   and the Defendants' Side of the Story\n\n              On    December    27,   2000,    Daynard      sued   the     Motley\n\ndefendants and the Scruggs defendants in the Superior Court for\n\nSuffolk County, Massachusetts, seeking, among other things,\n\ncompensation in the form of what Daynard says is his rightful\n\nshare of fees generated from settlements with several states,\n\nnot including Massachusetts.             Daynard claims that Ness Motley\n\nand Scruggs Millette have already received millions and will\n\nreceive over two billion dollars of the fees generated from the\n\nsettlement, 5% of which he claims is rightfully his.                     With the\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fconsent of the Motley defendants, the Scruggs defendants removed\n\nthe case to federal district court on January 18, 2001.    See 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1441 (1994).\n\n         In their answer, the Motley defendants conceded the\n\nMassachusetts court's personal jurisdiction, but told a story on\n\nthe merits very different from Daynard's.   The Motley defendants\n\nadmit that, in 1993, Patrick of Ness Motley met Daynard in\n\nMassachusetts, and that the firm continued to meet with and\n\ncommunicate with Daynard.   Furthermore, they agree that Daynard\n\nprovided them with documents related to the tobacco litigation,\n\nidentified some potential witnesses, and did some general work\n\non the state tobacco litigation.     The Motley defendants admit\n\nthat the firm made specific requests of Daynard and provided him\n\nwith transportation to certain meetings and proceedings.    They\n\nsay that they paid Daynard for this work.\n\n         But the Motley defendants downplay Daynard's expertise,\n\nsay that his assistance was neither invaluable nor substantial,\n\nand claim that his theories never formed a central component of\n\ntheir tobacco litigation.   Furthermore, they deny that either\n\nthey or Scruggs ever met with Daynard in Chicago and agreed upon\n\nthe 5% figure.    They deny that any agreement as alleged by\n\n                              -15-\n\fDaynard existed.           The Motley defendants' position is that they\n\nhave already paid Daynard any money they ever owed him.\n\n              On    May    30,    2001,   the     Motley   defendants        moved   for\n\nsummary judgment.           The district court denied this motion in part\n\non September 13, 2001, and issued its conclusions in a written\n\nmemorandum         on   December    3,    2001.       Daynard       v.

On April 20, 2001, they moved to dismiss Daynard's\n\ncomplaint for lack of personal jurisdiction or for failure to\n\nstate    a    claim,       and    moved   in    the    alternative        for    summary\n\njudgement.          See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2), 12(b)(6), and 56.\n\nScruggs stated that he never agreed to share any fees with\n\nDaynard and that\n\n              [i]t has always been my understanding that Professor\n              Daynard acted as a volunteer in all of his endeavors\n              with respect to the litigation, or was otherwise\n\n                                          -16-\n\f            compensated by Ness Motley as a consultant on a\n            limited basis, and that his activities were designed\n            primarily to promote his own agenda with respect to\n            tobacco control.\n\n            As    to   personal   jurisdiction,    Scruggs   states   that\n\nneither he nor his firm has ever had any offices, real estate,\n\nbank accounts, or other property in Massachusetts.           Furthermore,\n\nnone   of   the   Scruggs   defendants     has   ever   practiced   law   in\n\nMassachusetts. Daynard does not deny this.          In addition, Scruggs\n\nsays that he has never traveled to Massachusetts in connection\n\nwith any fee sharing arrangement with Daynard or in connection\n\nwith any of Daynard's work under the alleged arrangement.                 He\n\ndenies that he or his firm had any role in contacting or\n\nretaining Daynard in Massachusetts.          He further states that the\n\nScruggs defendants did not request, or even have knowledge of,\n\nthe Motley defendants' meetings with Daynard.                Scruggs also\n\ndenies that the Scruggs defendants or the Mississippi joint\n\nventure, to the extent that it existed, ever gave the Motley\n\ndefendants any directions with respect to Daynard.\n\n            Although Scruggs concedes that \"Daynard did at times\n\nconsult with me concerning the tobacco litigation in general,\"\n\nhe says that \"these instances were extremely infrequent and were\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\fnot requested or solicited by me\" and that the \"'assistance' .\n\n. . consisted of nothing more than information already made\n\navailable to the general public.\"\n\n           With    respect   to    any     relationship      between   Scruggs\n\nMillette and Ness Motley, Scruggs stated, in a second affidavit,\n\nthat   Scruggs    Millette   was    part    of   a   written   joint   venture\n\nagreement in the Mississippi litigation, but that Ness Motley\n\nwas not a party to that agreement.               He says that \"[p]rior to\n\nApril of 1999, there was simply no arrangement [between Scruggs\n\nMillette   and    Ness   Motley]    with     respect    to   the   sharing   of\n\nattorney's fees in the nationwide tobacco litigation.\"                 Scruggs\n\nalso noted that there was no agreement that \"either Scruggs\n\nMillette   or     Ness   Motley    could    exert    control    over   tobacco\n\nlitigation in states where those firms were not counsel of\n\nrecord.\"\n\n           The district court, after one hearing on May 31, 2001,\n\nand after granting Daynard limited jurisdictional discovery on\n\nthe issue of the relationship between the defendants from 1992\n\nto 1998, held another hearing on September 13, 2001, in which it\n\ndismissed Daynard's complaint against the Scruggs defendants for\n\nlack of personal jurisdiction.             At that September 13 hearing,\n\n                                     -18-\n\fthe district court stated what it labeled the \"bottom line of\n\n[its]   reasoning\"     for   finding       that   it     lacked     personal\n\njurisdiction over the Scruggs defendants:\n\n          [W]hile the facts are sufficient to show a joint\n          venture with respect to the Mississippi litigation, as\n          the First Circuit has defined the term substantial\n          influence in the Donatelli versus National Hockey\n          League case, there is insufficient evidence in this\n          case that the Mississippi law firm or Mr. Scruggs\n          exercised a substantial influence over the Ness firm\n          such as would subject Scruggs or the Mississippi firm\n          to personal jurisdiction in Massachusetts.\n\nSoon after that, the court entered final judgment in favor of\n\nthe Scruggs defendants, thus permitting an immediate appeal to\n\nthis court.\n\n          The    district    court     supported       its     September    13\n\nconclusion in a December 21, 2001, memorandum.

In   that    memorandum,       the   district    court\n\naddressed two theories on which Daynard might show personal\n\njurisdiction over the Scruggs defendants.          Id. at 60-76.        First,\n\nthe district court concluded that it did not have personal\n\njurisdiction over the Scruggs defendants based on their own\n\ndirect contacts with Massachusetts.           Id. at 68.         Second, the\n\ndistrict court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over the\n\n                                    -19-\n\fScruggs defendants based on contacts imputed from the Motley\n\ndefendants.   Id. at 76.   The district court reasoned that the\n\nScruggs defendants \"likely were not in a joint venture\" with the\n\nMotley defendants,2 that the Motley defendants did not act as the\n\nScruggs defendants' agent,3 and that the \"substantial influence\"\n\nrequirement articulated in Donatelli, 893 F.2d at 469, 472,\n\nprecluded jurisdiction under the Due Process Clause, U.S. Const.\n\namend. XIV.   Daynard, 184 F. Supp. 2d at 74-76.   Daynard appeals\n\nthe district court's holding that it lacks personal jurisdiction\n\nunder an imputed or attributed contacts theory.4\n\n\n     2    This conclusion is in some tension with the district\ncourt's earlier explanation, at the September 13 hearing, that\n\"the facts are sufficient to show a joint venture with respect\nto the Mississippi litigation.\"\n     3    Earlier in its opinion, however, the district court\nnoted that \"the South Carolina defendants arguably acted as the\nMississippi defendants' emissary,\" Daynard, 184 F. Supp. 2d at\n66, an observation seemingly inconsistent with its conclusion\nthat no agency relationship existed.\n     4    Daynard focuses on the district court's attributed\ncontacts holding rather than on the district court's conclusion\nthat the Scruggs defendants' direct contacts are insufficient.\nThe Scruggs defendants emphasize this, noting that Daynard has\nnot argued that their direct contacts alone are sufficient to\npermit personal jurisdiction. We agree that Daynard does not\nadvance this argument, but note that many of those facts,\ninsufficient to establish jurisdiction based on the Scruggs\ndefendants' direct contacts, are, of course, relevant to the\nimputed contacts analysis as well. One cannot make a sensible\n\n                              -20-\n\f                               II.\n\nA.

The district court, faced\n\nwith a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, Fed.\n\nR. Civ.

Foster-\n\nMiller, 46 F.3d at 145; Boit, 967 F.2d at 674-75.     \"The most\n\nconventional of these methods,\" known as the \"prima facie\"\n\nmethod, Foster-Miller, 46 F.3d at 145, \"permits the district\n\ncourt 'to consider only whether the plaintiff has proffered\n\nevidence that, if credited, is enough to support findings of all\n\n\n\n\ninquiry into whether contacts imputed to the Scruggs defendants\nsupport personal jurisdiction without viewing those same\ncontacts in the context of all of the other alleged facts of the\ncase.\n\n                               -21-\n\ffacts essential to personal jurisdiction,'\" id.

We review the district court's\n\nchoice of method de novo.        Foster-Miller, 46 F.3d at 147.      The\n\nparties do not object to the district court's choice of the\n\nprima facie method.           Daynard states in his brief that the\n\ndistrict court employed the prima facie approach and the Scruggs\n\ndefendants    agree,    making     no     attempt   to   challenge   the\n\napplicability    of    this    approach.      Therefore,   the   Scruggs\n\ndefendants have waived any objection to the application of the\n\nprima facie method.      Cashmere & Camel Hair Mfrs. Inst. v.

Foster-Miller, 46 F.3d at\n\n144.\n\n           Daynard's complaint pleads that personal jurisdiction\n\nexists under subsections (a), (c), and (d) of the Massachusetts\n\n\n\n\n                               -24-\n\flong-arm statute.

We may sidestep the statutory inquiry and proceed\n\ndirectly to the constitutional analysis, however, because the\n\nSupreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has interpreted the\n\nstate's long-arm statute \"as an assertion of jurisdiction over\n\nthe person to the limits allowed by the Constitution of the\n\n\n    7      The statute states, in relevant part:\n\n    A Court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a person,\n    who acts directly or by an agent, as to a cause of action\n    in law or equity arising from the person's\n\n           (a)    transacting any business     in this commonwealth;\n                  . . .\n\n           (c)    causing tortious injury by an act or omission in\n                  this commonwealth; [or]\n\n           (d)    causing tortious injury in this commonwealth by\n                  an act or omission outside this commonwealth if\n                  he regularly does or solicits business, or\n                  engages in any other persistent course of\n                  conduct, or derives substantial revenue . . . ,\n                  in this commonwealth . . . .\n\nMass.

Imputed Contacts\n\n            Daynard      alleges    that   the    relationship   between   the\n\nMotley defendants and the Scruggs defendants is such that some\n\nof the Motley defendants' contacts with Massachusetts should be\n\nimputed   to    the   Scruggs      defendants.      As   the   district   court\n\nrecognized, whether the defendants were in all respects joint\n\n                                      -27-\n\fventurers is not alone dispositive, Daynard, 184 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n74,   although       the   parties   focus   much   of   their   energies    on\n\ndisputing this particular issue.             The basic question is whether\n\nthe relationship between the Scruggs defendants and the Motley\n\ndefendants, however one labels it, is sufficient to attribute\n\nany of the Motley defendants' contacts to the Scruggs defendants\n\nfor the purpose of reaching the Scruggs defendants under the\n\nMassachusetts long-arm statute as cabined by the Due Process\n\nClause   of    the    Fourteenth     Amendment.     We   conclude   that    the\n\nrelationship was sufficient for that purpose.               Daynard has put\n\nforth evidence that, if credited and accepted as true, is enough\n\nto support personal jurisdiction over the Scruggs defendants.\n\n              Daynard alleges that the Motley defendants and the\n\nScruggs defendants were part of a formal, written joint venture\n\nbetween themselves.          He also says that he believed the parties\n\nto be joint venturers because they \"consistently purported to\n\nbe\" in such a relationship.            Daynard argues that at the time\n\nCharles Patrick of Ness Motley came to Massachusetts to retain\n\nhim, Ness Motley and Scruggs Millette were engaged in a form of\n\ntobacco litigation joint venture.            Daynard says that Patrick was\n\nacting for both firms when Patrick retained him and that Patrick\n\n                                      -28-\n\fretained him to advance the objectives of the joint venture.\n\nThroughout his dealings with Ness Motley and Scruggs Millette,\n\nhe understood the two firms to be in a joint venture that at\n\nfirst encompassed the Mississippi tobacco litigation and then\n\nbroadened to include tobacco litigation nationwide.\n\n            1. Applicability of Donatelli's \"substantial\n               influence\" test.\n\n            First, there is the threshold question of whether the\n\ndistrict court properly applied Donatelli, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"534783\"><a href=\"/opinion/534783/john-clark-donatelli-v-national-hockey-league/\"><span class=\"volume\">893</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">459</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, as the\n\ngoverning     test.       The   parties    devote   the   majority     of   their\n\nattention to this issue, but it is not dispositive of the\n\npersonal jurisdiction question.              The district court concluded\n\nthat   even    if   the    Motley    defendants     acted   as   the    Scruggs\n\ndefendants'     agents,     \"there   was     no   substantial    influence     as\n\nrequired by Due Process.\"           Daynard, 184 F. Supp. 2d at 76.           The\n\ndistrict court derived this \"substantial influence\" requirement\n\nfrom Donatelli, 893 F.2d at 469, a general jurisdiction case.\n\nThe district court was in error.             It read Donatelli as applying\n\nan exclusive test and as applying in the present, very different\n\ncontext.      This over-reads Donatelli.\n\n            The question before us is whether Daynard must meet the\n\n\n                                      -29-\n\fsubstantial   influence     test     in   order    to   comply   with\n\njurisdictional Due Process requirements.          Although   Donatelli\n\naids our inquiry, we conclude that its substantial influence\n\ntest is not the exclusive test for attribution of conduct.          It\n\ndoes not control the matter before us here, where the questions\n\nare whether the Scruggs defendants were in an actual or apparent\n\nagency relationship, or at least held themselves out to be in a\n\njoint venture or other agency relationship with the Motley\n\ndefendants, and whether the Scruggs defendants ratified the\n\nMotley defendants' conduct.\n\n         In Donatelli, this court held that\n\n         an unincorporated association which does not itself\n         conduct   significant   activities   in,   or   enjoy\n         affiliating circumstances with, a state cannot be\n         subject to the general personal jurisdiction of the\n         state's courts on the basis of a member's contacts\n         within the state unless the member carries on the in-\n         forum activities under the association's substantial\n         influence.\n\nId. at 472.   Donatelli sued the National Hockey League (\"NHL\")\n\nin Rhode Island, challenging the NHL's draft and its failure to\n\ndeclare him a free agent.   Jurisdiction in Rhode Island over the\n\nNHL was premised on the fact that a member team of the NHL had\n\ncontacts with Rhode Island.        His suit was unrelated to either\n\n\n                               -30-\n\fthe NHL's contacts with Rhode Island or its member's contacts\n\nwith Rhode Island.        Id. at 462.     The Donatelli court rejected\n\nthe theory that the NHL could be subject to general personal\n\njurisdiction in Rhode Island simply because one of its members\n\nwas subject to general jurisdiction in that state.           Id. at 472.\n\nIt   concluded    that,   in   these    circumstances,   a   showing   of\n\n\"substantial influence\" was necessary in order to attribute\n\none's contacts to the other consistent with the requirement of\n\npurposeful availment.       Id. at 469.\n\n            Donatelli's substantial influence test does not control\n\nthe entire universe of cases in which one party's contacts might\n\nbe attributed to another.       By its terms, Donatelli applies \"in\n\nthe world of unincorporated associations.\"        Id. at 468.    Indeed,\n\nas Donatelli itself observed, the substantial influence test\n\ndoes not control where one seeks to attribute contacts from\n\npartner to partnership or from subsidiary to corporate parent.\n\nId. at 465-67.     In the partnership context, \"the activities of\n\nthe partner are generally attributed to the partnership and\n\njurisdiction over the partnership follows from the partner's\n\ncontacts,    if   sufficient,     regardless     of   the    absence   of\n\nindependent contacts between the partnership qua entity and the\n\n                                  -31-\n\fforum.\"    Id. at 466.       Donatelli's substantial influence test\n\ndoes not apply here, where the question is whether an actual or\n\nimplied agency relationship, sufficient to attribute contacts,\n\nexisted between the parties.          We conclude that, similar to some\n\ncases involving actual partnerships, the relationship between\n\nthe defendants here invokes certain principles of the law of\n\nagency, partnership, and joint venture and that these principles\n\npermit imputing contacts without the need to show substantial\n\ninfluence.\n\n            In   addition,     although      we     do   not   decide   whether\n\nDonatelli's approach to attribution is necessarily limited to\n\ngeneral jurisdiction cases, we note, as stated several times in\n\nthe Donatelli opinion, including in the above quoted passage,\n\nthat Donatelli \"focus[ed] . . . upon . . . general as opposed to\n\nspecific jurisdiction.\" Id. at 463; see also id. at 461 (stating the\n\nissue on appeal as whether \"an unincorporated association is subject to\n\nthe general personal jurisdiction of every court having jurisdiction\n\nover one of its members\") (internal quotation marks omitted). This is\n\nimportant because, as Donatelli states clearly, the standard for\n\ngeneral    jurisdiction   is    more    strict      than    the    standard   for\n\nspecific    jurisdiction.       Id.    at    463.        General   jurisdiction\n\n\n                                      -32-\n\frequires    that    the    defendant's      activities   in     the    forum   be\n\n\"continuous       and    systematic,\"     United    Elec.,    Radio     &   Mach.\n\nWorkers,    960     F.2d    at   1088,    whereas    specific    jurisdiction\n\nrequires a lesser showing.\n\n            The problem Donatelli addresses is, in some ways, more\n\nlikely to occur in general jurisdiction cases.                        In general\n\njurisdiction cases, the suit does not arise out of or relate to\n\nthe defendant's forum contacts.               Helicopteros Nacionales de\n\nColombia, S.A. v. Hall, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111159\"><a href=\"/opinion/111159/helicopteros-nacionales-de-colombia-sa-v-hall/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">408</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 414 n.9 (1984).                  Donatelli\n\naddresses     the       potentially      unjust    scenario     in     which   an\n\nassociation, with no direct contacts with a forum, is haled into\n\na forum based on one of its members' continuous and systematic\n\nactivities in the forum, to answer a lawsuit unrelated to either\n\nthe member's or the association's in-forum activities.                  893 F.2d\n\nat 469.     Something more is needed to say that the association\n\nhas purposefully availed itself of the benefits of in-forum\n\nactivity.     Otherwise, the association is subject to a suit in\n\nthat forum, unrelated to anything the association has done in\n\nthe forum, by merely engaging in a limited relationship with a\n\nmember, that through its own activities engages in continuous\n\nand systematic activities in a forum.\n\n                                      -33-\n\f           Donatelli resolves this problem by holding that, in\n\ngeneral jurisdiction cases, the association must \"exercise[ ]\n\nsubstantial influence over the member's decision to carry on the\n\nin-forum   activities      which   constitute      the   relevant   'minimum\n\ncontacts.'\"     Id.     This requirement ensures that the association\n\npurposefully     availed    itself   of     the   benefits   of   the   forum,\n\nbecause    it   links    the   member's     in-forum     activity   with   the\n\nassociation's relationship with that member.\n\n           This problem, however, is less likely to arise in\n\nspecific jurisdiction cases such as this one.                 Here a direct\n\nconnection is alleged between the in-forum activities of the\n\nagent (the Motley defendants) and the agent's relationship with\n\nthe principal (the Scruggs defendants).                  When the cause of\n\naction relates to both the association's activities giving rise\n\nto the suit and to the member's in-forum activities, the same\n\nrisk of unfairness is not necessarily present.               In the present\n\ncase, Daynard's suit relates to the Scruggs defendants' alleged\n\npromise to pay him a share of the fees and to the                       Motley\n\ndefendants' activities in Massachusetts, claimed to have been\n\nratified by Scruggs.           Donatelli is not controlling in this\n\ncontext.    It addresses a question different from the inquiry\n\n                                     -34-\n\fhere, which is whether there was an agency relationship between\n\nthe defendants and whether the Scruggs defendants ratified the\n\nMotley defendants' activities in Massachusetts giving rise to\n\nDaynard's suit.\n\n            But that does not end the matter.           We must still\n\ndetermine    whether   the   relationship   between    the   defendants\n\npermits imputing a sufficient quantum of the Motley defendants'\n\nconnections to the Scruggs defendants.\n\n            2.

Under the\n\nRestatement (Second) of Agency,\n\n         [a] person who is not otherwise liable as a party to\n         a transaction purported to be done on his account, is\n         nevertheless subject to liability to persons who have\n         changed their positions because of their belief that\n         the transaction was entered into by or for him, if\n\n         (a)     he intentionally     or   carelessly   caused   such\n                 belief, or\n\n         (b)     knowing of such belief and that others might\n\n                               -37-\n\f                     change their positions because of it, he did\n                     not take reasonable steps to notify them of the\n                     facts.\n\nRestatement       (Second)   of    Agency    §   8B   (1958);       accord   H.G.\n\nReuschlein & W.A.

Schiff, The Law of Agency 38 (1984) (stating an\n\n\"equitable principle of agency by estoppel\" similar to that of\n\nthe Restatement (Second)).\n\n            Even if the defendants' relationship were to fall\n\nslightly outside of the confines of these specific doctrines,\n\nthe question before us is whether a sufficient relationship\n\nexists under the Due Process Clause to permit the exercise of\n\njurisdiction, not whether a partnership, joint venture, or other\n\nparticular    agency      relationship      between     the   two    defendants\n\nexists.     We think it consistent with the Due Process Clause to\n\nattribute    to    the   Scruggs   defendants     the    Motley     defendants'\n\nretention of, and certain interactions with, Daynard where, as\n\n                                     -38-\n\fDaynard alleges, they have led Daynard and the public to believe\n\nthey were joint venturers.                     That is a different issue from\n\nwhether, in a dispute between the two firms, a joint venture\n\nagreement could be enforced.\n\n             We take the facts alleged and produced by Daynard in\n\nthe light most favorable to his jurisdictional assertion.                              Even\n\nif the parties were not joint venturers, they held themselves\n\nout to Daynard to be part of a joint venture or other agency\n\nrelationship        and        are     subject,       for   personal       jurisdiction\n\npurposes, to the doctrine of estoppel.                      Daynard, throughout his\n\ndealings     with    the       defendants,          understood     them   to   be     joint\n\nventurers.     He says the parties \"consistently purported to be\n\njoint    venturers\"        and        that     he    reasonably     relied       on    this\n\nunderstanding.       The question is whether he had a basis for this\n\nbelief   grounded         in    the     Scruggs      defendants'     own    conduct      or\n\nconduct undertaken with their consent.\n\n             In support of his understanding, Daynard states that\n\nhe believed the firms to be in a joint venture based on their\n\nstatements and conduct.                Daynard states that Patrick was acting\n\nfor   both   firms    when           Patrick    retained     him    and   that    Patrick\n\nretained him to advance the objectives of the joint venture.                             He\n\n                                             -39-\n\fsays that during this first meeting, Patrick described the\n\ntobacco litigation as stemming from a meeting between Scruggs\n\nand the Mississippi attorney general, which then resulted in\n\nScruggs \"br[inging] the Motley firm into their plans.\"\n\n          Daynard supports his claim with documentary evidence\n\nof a joint venture that he unearthed through jurisdictional\n\ndiscovery.      Around October 1994, the Scruggs defendants entered\n\ninto a \"Joint Venture Agreement\" with several firms to pursue\n\ntobacco litigation on behalf of the state of Mississippi.                 The\n\nMotley defendants claim to have abided by this agreement and\n\ntheir firm's name was listed on the agreement, although they\n\nnever signed the agreement.         In a letter from Joseph Rice of\n\nNess   Motley    to   Richard   Scruggs,    Rice   stated:    \"As   we   have\n\ndiscussed several times, we have not signed the Mississippi\n\nJoint Venture Agreement solely because we don't want to be\n\ngoverned by Mississippi Tax Law.           We are agreeable to all terms\n\nin the agreement and, as you know, we have acted under the\n\nagreement from the beginning.\"        In the agreement, Ness Motley\n\nfirm members, including Mr. Motley, were listed as members of\n\nseveral of the \"teams\" and \"committees\" forming the \"Litigation\n\nManagement Structure\" outlined in the agreement.             Mr. Motley was\n\n                                   -40-\n\fa   co-chairman    of    the   \"Public   Relations   Team,\"    which   also\n\nincluded Steve Bozeman from Scruggs Millette.                 Indeed, Ness\n\nMotley was counsel of record in the Mississippi case.                    In\n\naddition, Daynard notes that \"the two defendant firms were\n\nparties to a 'Resolution' which recited that they had both 'made\n\nand   entered     into    that   certain    Joint    Venture    Agreement'\n\nconcerning the Mississippi litigation.\"\n\n          Scruggs says that Ness Motley did not sign the joint\n\nventure agreement, that Ness Motley did not perform under the\n\nagreement's terms, and that the litigation team did not function\n\nas outlined in the agreement.        He says Ness Motley did not make\n\nthe capital contributions specified in the agreement, that there\n\nwas a distinction between being counsel of record and being a\n\nparty to the joint venture agreement, and that Ness Motley's\n\nfailure to sign the agreement caused \"great concern.\"              Scruggs\n\nsays that, upon receiving the letter from Rice, stating that\n\nNess Motley had \"acted under the agreement from the beginning,\"\n\nhe called Rice and told him that \"this wasn't good enough\" and\n\nthat \"nobody else\" considered Ness Motley to have performed\n\nunder the agreement.\n\n          Scruggs concedes, however, that the profits from the\n\n                                    -41-\n\fMississippi        litigation,     outlined   in    this     agreement,        were\n\neventually     divided      with   Ness   Motley,   but     he   says   that    the\n\ndivision was under the terms of a 1999 agreement.                        Scruggs\n\nstates that his \"understanding with Ness Motley was always that\n\nat the end of the day, we would attempt to negotiate a fee and\n\nexpense sharing arrangement, each trusting the goodwill of the\n\nother   to    reach     a   successful    negotiation,       but   without      any\n\nguarantee that we would.\"             In addition, Scruggs admits that\n\n\"[t]here     was    a   general    cooperative     effort    between    [Scruggs\n\nMillette and Ness Motley] to advance litigation against the\n\ntobacco industry.\"\n\n             Daynard then says that after Motley hired him, he began\n\na course of dealing with the defendants in which he provided\n\nboth firms with legal advice, including advice to members of the\n\nScruggs firm physically present in Boston, as well as assistance\n\nprovided from Boston by phone and fax.                    Daynard also cites\n\nseveral conversations with both Scruggs and Motley in which they\n\nagreed to pay him a share of the fees obtained by both firms,\n\nScruggs's statement that Scruggs had at least apparent authority\n\nto promise the 5%, and Motley's statement that he would be\n\ncompensated as part of the \"team.\"\n\n                                      -42-\n\f           Daynard    cites     a    popular     book   about    the     tobacco\n\nlitigation, which he says describes Ness Motley and Scruggs\n\nMillette as joint venturers beginning in 1993, as evidence that\n\nthe firms were engaged in a well publicized joint venture or at\n\nleast held themselves out to be so engaged.                      See M. Orey,\n\nAssuming the Risk: The Mavericks, the Lawyers, and the Whistle-\n\nBlowers Who Beat Big Tobacco 265 (1999) (stating that Scruggs,\n\nMotley,   and   two   others,       were   the   \"nucleus\"      of   a   tobacco\n\nlitigation \"team,\" which \"drafted a joint-venture agreement that\n\nspelled out in elaborate detail the duties each of the lawyers\n\nwould perform\").      He notes, as additional evidence of public\n\nperception, that in the Texas tobacco litigation, other lawyers\n\nsent the firms checks made payable to \"Ness Motley/Scruggs.\"                    At\n\nleast four such checks appear in the record.\n\n           Finally, in support of his claim that the defendants\n\nheld themselves out to be joint venturers, Daynard presents a\n\n1998 letter to Hawaii's attorney general, from Joseph Rice of\n\nNess Motley, stating that \"Ness, Motley has an arrangement with\n\nRichard Scruggs to work jointly on all of the state cases\n\nagainst   the   Tobacco   Industry.\"         Noting     that   \"[w]e     have   no\n\nformal, written agreement,\" he said \"Ness, Motley and Dick\n\n                                      -43-\n\fScruggs have been doing business together for almost ten years\n\nand have never had any differences.         We fully anticipate sitting\n\ndown in hindsight and determining what the division of any\n\nrecoveries would be between the two law firms.\"\n\n           Scruggs said that he considered Rice's statement that\n\n\"Ness, Motley has an arrangement with Richard Scruggs to work\n\njointly on all of the state cases against the Tobacco Industry\"\n\nto be \"a bit of an overstatement.\"           On the other hand, Rice's\n\nletter to Hawaii's attorney general said \"I am sending a copy of\n\nthis letter to Dick so he may respond likewise, if he has any\n\nquestions or any additions.\"     Scruggs did not write anything to\n\ncontradict   Rice's    characterization        and    stated,   in    his\n\ndeposition, that \"[t]here was no reason to contradict it.\"\n\nScruggs conceded that \"[t]here was a general cooperative effort\n\nbetween [Scruggs Millette and Ness Motley] to advance litigation\n\nagainst the tobacco industry.\" Although this letter may not go\n\nto   Daynard's   understanding   of   the    firms'   relationship,   and\n\nalthough it was written by Rice of Ness Motley, not by any of\n\nthe Scruggs defendants, Scruggs's silence carries at least some\n\nweight.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -44-\n\f          The facts as alleged by Daynard are sufficient to make\n\nthe jurisdictional showing that, in Boston, Patrick of Ness\n\nMotley hired Daynard, that Daynard reasonably understood Patrick\n\nto be acting on behalf of a joint venture or other agency\n\nrelationship between Ness Motley and Scruggs Millette, and that\n\nDaynard relied on this understanding by providing his services\n\nto both defendants.\n\n          Many of these same facts support the conclusion that\n\nthe   Scruggs   defendants   subsequently   ratified   the   Motley\n\ndefendants' conduct.    Even if Patrick, when he hired Daynard,\n\nwas acting without actual authority from the Scruggs defendants,\n\nDaynard says Patrick purported to act as an agent for both firms\n\nwhen Patrick retained Daynard, and that Scruggs effectively\n\nratified that representation.\n\n          \"A person may ratify a prior act done by another without\n\nactual or apparent authority. . . . by . . . conduct that is\n\njustifiable only on the assumption that the person so consents.\"\n\nRestatement (Third) of Agency § 4.01 (Tentative Draft No. 2, 2001).9\n\n\n      9   As described in the Restatement (Second), \"Ratification\nis the affirmance by a person of a prior act which did not bind\nhim but which was done or professedly done on his account,\nwhereby the act, as to some or all persons, is given effect as\nif originally authorized by him.\"       Restatement (Second) of\n\n                                -45-\n\f\"The sole requirement for ratification is a manifestation of assent or\n\nother conduct indicative of consent by the principal.\" Restatement\n\n(Third) of Agency, supra, § 4.01, cmt. b; see also Inn Foods, Inc. v.\n\nEquitable Coop.

The Scruggs defendants, on the facts\n\nalleged, engaged in such conduct.\n\n           After Ness Motley retained Daynard, and as a result of\n\nthis   employment,   Daynard      asserts    that   he   began     providing\n\ninformation directly to the Scruggs defendants.                 Daynard says\n\nthat he \"communicated regularly\" with the Scruggs defendants,\n\nthat they came to Boston to receive his advice, and that he \"had\n\nmany   conversations,     meetings     and   written   communications      in\n\nBoston   with   members   of    the   defendant   firms,   in    which   [he]\n\nprovided advice and undertook specific projects for their use in\n\nthe tobacco litigation.\"        Even if the Scruggs defendants did not\n\ncome to Boston, we think there is adequate other evidence of\n\nratification, accepting Daynard's allegations.\n\n           Daynard says that he had \"several conversations\" with\n\n\"both Mr. Motley and Mr. Scruggs in which they stated that they\n\n\n\nAgency, supra, § 82.\n\n                                      -46-\n\fwould appropriately compensate [Daynard] . . . and that the\n\nfinal form of compensation would be\" in the form of a share of\n\nthe fees the firms obtained from handling the state tobacco\n\nlitigation.    Daynard says Ronald Motley advised him that he\n\nwould be compensated for his assistance as a member of the Ness\n\nMotley \"team.\" Further evidence of ratification comes from Daynard's\n\nversion of the Chicago meeting, where Scruggs said he acted with at\n\nleast apparent authority for both firms and reached an agreement.\n\nDaynard says that Scruggs shook hands on a deal to pay him 5% of these\n\nfees. These assurances and reassurances that Daynard would be paid a\n\nportion of the recovered fees were an integral part of the ongoing\n\nrelationship existing between Daynard, the Motley defendants, and the\n\nScruggs defendants.\n\n          Finally, Daynard asserts that in reliance on his arrangements\n\nwith the Scruggs defendants and at their request, he had to commit out-\n\nof-pocket expenses of $15,000 to retain someone to meet his teaching\n\nobligations. Again, there is no evidence that Scruggs disavowed any\n\ncontractual relationship as he accepted Daynard's assistance. To be\n\nsure, Scruggs says Daynard was a volunteer, but reasonable inferences\n\nsupport Daynard's version.\n\n          The Scruggs defendants had many opportunities to disavow a\n\nrelationship with Daynard or to clarify the relationship. For example,\n\n\n\n                                 -47-\n\fthey could have rejected his assistance or accepted it only on certain\n\nconditions. Instead, according to Daynard, they repeatedly encouraged\n\nand accepted his assistance and during several conversations agreed to\n\npay him in the form of a share of the fees generated. When Daynard\n\nwrote his first letter to Scruggs in July 1997 confirming the\n\nfee arrangement, Scruggs remained silent.10\n\n          By knowingly accepting the benefits of the transaction\n\ninitiated in Massachusetts, the Scruggs defendants ratified Patrick's\n\nact of hiring and retaining Daynard on behalf of both firms, which\n\nultimately gave rise to this law suit. See Inn Foods, 45 F.3d at 597\n\nn.7 (noting that \"benefits received are certainly strong evidence that\n\nthe principal acquiesced in the agent's transaction\"); Restatement\n\n(Third) of Agency, supra, § 4.01, cmt. d. In addition, by repeatedly\n\nagreeing to compensate Daynard for ongoing work conducted in\n\nMassachusetts, agreeing to pay Daynard a share of the fees and later\n\nshaking hands on the 5% figure, and accepting his coming from Boston to\n\nMississippi to assist at trial, Scruggs, acting on behalf of his firm\n\n\n\n     10    It was not until November 1997, after Daynard had provided\nyears of services and the firms were expecting to reap significant\nfinancial rewards from at least the Mississippi and Florida litigation,\nthat Scruggs responded to Daynard's second letter, after he\nignored the first letter, and disavowed the 5% fee arrangement.\nDaynard asserts that, even at this point, Scruggs disputed only\nthe extent of Daynard's compliance with the agreement, not the\nexistence of the agreement.\n\n                                 -48-\n\fand, according to Daynard, the Ness Motley firm as well, ratified the\n\narrangement in which the Motley defendants agreed to pay Daynard for\n\nhis ongoing services as a member of the team.\n\nD. The Remaining Constitutional Analysis\n\n           The   easier    question      in   the   case    is   the    remaining\n\nconstitutional    one.         Given    the   Scruggs      defendants'     direct\n\ncontacts with Massachusetts and their contacts imputed from the\n\nMotley   defendants,      do   the     Scruggs   defendants      have   \"minimum\n\ncontacts\" with Massachusetts \"such that the maintenance of the\n\nsuit does not offend 'traditional notions of fair play and\n\nsubstantial justice.'\"?         Int'l Shoe, 326 U.S. at 316 (quoting\n\nMilliken, 311 U.S. at 463).            The answer is yes.\n\n           For specific jurisdiction, this circuit divides the\n\nconstitutional    analysis       into    three   categories:      relatedness,\n\npurposeful availment, and reasonableness:\n\n           First, the claim underlying the litigation must\n           directly arise out of, or relate to, the defendant's\n           forum-state activities. Second, the defendant's in-\n           state contacts must represent a purposeful availment\n           of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum\n           state, thereby invoking the benefits and protections\n           of that state's laws and making the defendant's\n           involuntary presence before the state's courts\n           foreseeable.    Third, the exercise of jurisdiction\n           must, in light of the Gestalt factors, be reasonable.\n\n\n\n                                       -49-\n\fFoster-Miller, 46 F.3d at 144; see also Noonan, 135 F.3d at 90.\n\nThe Supreme Court, speaking on the subject of specific personal\n\njurisdiction in contract cases, has \"emphasized that parties who\n\n'reach out beyond one state and create continuing relationships\n\nand obligations with citizens of another state' are subject to\n\nregulation and sanctions in the other State for the consequences\n\nof their activities.\"   Burger King, 471 U.S. at 473 (quoting\n\nTravelers Health Ass'n v.

Relatedness.\n\n          As to the first requirement, that \"the claim underlying\n\nthe litigation must directly arise out of, or relate to, the\n\ndefendant's forum-state activities,\" Foster-Miller, 46 F.3d at\n\n144, the district court correctly concluded, based merely on the\n\nScruggs defendants' direct contacts with the forum, that the\n\nalleged\n\n          breach of contract in this case \"arose\" from a course\n          of dealing between the parties. The contract was in\n          the form of a working relationship -- started in\n          Massachusetts -- that called for interaction between\n          Massachusetts,  South   Carolina,  and   Mississippi.\n          Drawing all inferences in favor of Daynard, he\n          arguably meets the relatedness requirement,\n\n\n\n\n                              -50-\n\fDaynard, 184 F. Supp. 2d at 66.            It is clear that    Daynard's\n\nbreach of contract claim \"arise[s] out of, or relate[s] to,\" the\n\nScruggs defendants' Massachusetts activities.         Foster-Miller, 46\n\nF.3d at 144.      Daynard's lawsuit is based on his claim that the\n\ndefendants owe him money for his work pursuant to an agreement\n\ninitiated    by     the   defendants   while    physically    present     in\n\nMassachusetts and performed, in part, in Massachusetts.                 This\n\nrelationship contemplated ongoing interaction between Daynard,\n\nin Massachusetts, and the defendants, in Mississippi and South\n\nCarolina.     Daynard's suit arises out of these Massachusetts\n\nactivities, which were instrumental to the formation of the\n\ndisputed oral contract.         See McGee v. Int'l Life Ins.

In\n\n                                           -54-\n\faddition, Daynard's interest in bringing his action in this\n\nforum, given the traditional deference accorded to a plaintiff's\n\nchoice of forum, weighs in favor of personal jurisdiction.                       This\n\nis particularly true in light of Massachusetts's stake in being\n\nable \"to provide a convenient forum for its residents to redress\n\ninjuries inflicted by out-of-forum actors.\"                 Sawtelle, 70 F.3d\n\nat 1395.    Massachusetts's adjudicatory interest is likely to\n\nweigh in favor of exercising personal jurisdiction because the\n\ndistrict court has already decided that, as between Daynard and\n\nthe Motley defendants, Massachusetts law governs the dispute\n\nover the oral fee-splitting arrangement.                 Daynard, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">188</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 118-23.         Finally, efficient administration of justice\n\nfavors   jurisdiction      in    Massachusetts,         where    this    action   is\n\nalready proceeding against the Motley defendants.\n\nE. Conclusion\n\n           We   conclude       that   the     Scruggs    defendants'      contacts\n\nproperly   imputed      from    the     Motley    defendants,          against    the\n\nbackdrop   of   the    Scruggs        defendants'       direct    contacts       with\n\nMassachusetts, constitute \"minimum contacts\" with Massachusetts\n\n\"such    that   the    maintenance       of    the   suit       does    not   offend\n\n'traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.'\"\n\n                                       -55-\n\fInt'l Shoe, 326 U.S. at 316 (quoting Milliken, 311 U.S. at 463).\n\nAgain, we emphasize that we reach this conclusion under the\n\nprima    facie    approach,     taking   Daynard's    properly   documented\n\nevidentiary proffers \"as true (whether or not disputed) and\n\nconstru[ing] them in the light most congenial to [Daynard's]\n\njurisdictional claim.\"           Mass. Sch. of Law, 142 F.3d at 34.\n\nNothing in the opinion precludes the Scruggs defendants, in the\n\nprospective district court proceedings, from challenging these\n\nfacts,    if     they   wish,    and     renewing    their   jurisdictional\n\nchallenge, if appropriate.\n\n                                       III.\n\n           For these reasons, we reverse the dismissal of the\n\nScruggs defendants for lack of personal jurisdiction and remand\n\nto the district court for further proceedings consistent with\n\nthis opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -56-\n\f</pre>",
