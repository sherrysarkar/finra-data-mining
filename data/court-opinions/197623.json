BACKGROUND\r\n\n          The  facts,   drawn  from   the  plaintiff's   verified\r\n\ncomplaint  and construed  in his favor,  see Dartmouth  Review v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nDartmouth  College, 889  F.2d  13,  16 (1st  Cir.  1989), can  be\r                            \r\n\nrecounted readily.  The defendant, Thomas E. Delahanty, II, is an\r\n\nassociate justice  of the Maine  Superior Court.  On  October 31,\r\n\n1995, Berner  was  seated in  the  gallery of  Judge  Delahanty's\r\n\ncourtroom,  waiting for  his  turn to  appear  before the  court.\r\n\nBerner wore a  circular button pinned to  his lapel.   The button\r\n\nwas approximately two  inches in diameter and bore  the words \"No\r                                                                        \"No\r\n\non  1  -  Maine  Won't  Discriminate.\"    This  legend  expressed\r          on  1  -  Maine  Won't  Discriminate.\"\r\n\nopposition  to  a  statewide referendum  that  Maine  voters were\r\n\nscheduled to consider during the November election.1  Neither the\r\n\npin nor its message were  related to Berner's business before the\r\n\ncourt.\r\n\n          At  some point  during  the  day's  proceedings,  Judge\r\n\nDelahanty  called Berner  to the  bench.  The  following exchange\r\n\ntook place:\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The referendum sought  to prohibit the passage of laws that\r\ncondemned discrimination on the basis  of sexual orientation.  It\r\nhad been the subject of heated debate.\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\n          THE COURT:   Mr. Berner . . .  Can you remove\r                    THE COURT:\r                             \r\n          the  political pen [sic]  while you're in the\r\n          courtroom?\r\n\n          ATTORNEY BERNER:   Your Honor, what  happened\r                    ATTORNEY BERNER:\r                                   \r\n          to my right to political speech?\r\n\n          THE COURT:   Not in the courtroom.   We don't\r                    THE COURT:\r                             \r\n          take sides.\r\n\n          ATTORNEY  BERNER:    I  want  the  record  to\r                    ATTORNEY  BERNER:\r                                    \r\n          reflect  that  I  don't  think  there's   any\r\n          authority for that.\r\n\n          THE COURT:   The courtroom is not    that may\r                    THE COURT:\r                             \r\n          be, but  the  courtroom is  not  a  political\r\n          forum.\r\n\n          ATTORNEY  BERNER:   Your  honor,  I want  the\r                    ATTORNEY  BERNER\r                                    \r\n          record to reflect that I object to that.\r\n\nReasonably believing that he would be held in contempt if he  did\r\n\nnot comply  with the  court's order,  Berner removed  the button.\r\n\nDuring  a  chambers conference  later  that day,  the  judge told\r\n\nBerner  that he  planned to  perpetuate  the prohibition  against\r\n\nlawyers wearing  political buttons  in his  courtroom unless  and\r\n\nuntil he was overruled by a higher authority.\r\n\n          Berner took refuge in the United States District Court,\r\n\nwhere he  sought declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 42\r\n\nU.S.C.     1983 (1994).    His rifle-shot  complaint  contained a\r\n\nsingle claim:  that the  button ban violated the First Amendment.\r\n\nIn support of this  claim Berner alleged that his button  had not\r\n\ncaused any  disruption of the ongoing proceedings  and that Judge\r\n\nDelahanty  \"routinely permitted the  wearing in his  courtroom of\r\n\nother ornamentation  supporting causes,  such  as crucifixes  and\r\n\ninsignia for armed forces or fraternal orders.\"\r\n\n          A flurry of motions ensued.  The  district court denied\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nBerner's  motion  for  a   preliminary  injunction,  finding   an\r\n\ninsufficient likelihood of success on the merits.  The court then\r\n\naddressed the defendant's  motions to dismiss the action for lack\r\n\nof standing and  failure to state an actionable claim.  The court\r\n\nfinessed  the former by  assuming, without deciding,  that Berner\r\n\nhad standing to sue.   See Berner v. Delahanty, 937  F. Supp. 62,\r                                                        \r\n\n62 (D. Me. 1996).\r\n\n          Turning  to the legal sufficiency of the complaint, the\r\n\ncourt  held that  the controlling legal  standard was  the forum-\r\n\nspecific analysis of  Cornelius v. NAACP Legal  Defense and Educ.\r                                                                           \r\n\nFund,  Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 800  (1985) (discussing varying levels\r                     \r\n\nof  scrutiny applicable to governmental restrictions on speech in\r\n\ndifferent fora).   See Berner, 937 F.  Supp. at 63.   Because the\r                                       \r\n\nparties \"agree[d] that the state courtroom is a nonpublic forum,\"\r\n\nJudge  Carter found, consistent with Cornelius, that the decision\r                                                        \r\n\nto limit the  wearing of political  buttons \"need  only be:   (1)\r\n\nreasonable in light of the purpose which the court serves and (2)\r\n\nviewpoint neutral.\"   Id.   Building on  this premise,  the judge\r                                   \r\n\nconcluded that the  restriction on political paraphernalia  was a\r\n\nreasonable attempt to  \"shield the courtroom from  the inevitable\r\n\nappearance  of politicization,\" and that there was \"no indication\r\n\nthat [Judge Delahanty]  intended to discourage one  viewpoint and\r\n\nadvance another.\"  Id.  Since he perceived the button ban to be a\r                                \r\n\n\"reasonable  viewpoint-neutral restriction,\"  Judge Carter  ruled\r\n\nthat the  complaint stated  no claim upon  which relief  could be\r\n\ngranted.  Id.\r                       \r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\n          On   appeal,  Berner   assails  the   district  court's\r\n\nanalysis.  He  maintains that the court placed  undue emphasis on\r\n\nCornelius; that  it erred  in gauging  the reasonableness of  the\r                   \r\n\nban; and, finally,  that it failed to give  appropriate weight to\r\n\nthe  defendant's tolerance of  persons wearing other politically-\r\n\ntinged ornamentation.\r\n\nII.  SCOPE OF REVIEW\r          II.  SCOPE OF REVIEW\r\n\n          We evaluate de novo a  district court's dismissal of an\r\n\naction  for failure to state  a cognizable claim.   See Aulson v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nBlanchard, 83  F.3d 1,  3 (1st Cir.  1996).   In assaying  such a\r                   \r\n\ndismissal, the appellate court, like the court that  preceded it,\r\n\nmust assume that the factual  averments of the complaint are true\r\n\nand must draw all plausible inferences in  the plaintiff's favor.\r\n\nSee Leatherman v. Tarrant  Cty. Narcotics Intell. &amp; Coord.  Unit,\r                                                                          \r\n\n507 U.S. 163, 164 (1993); Dartmouth Review, 889 F.2d at 16.\r                                                    \r\n\n          In this case, the district court gracefully sidestepped\r\n\nthe standing inquiry,  preferring instead a pas  de deux directly\r                                                                  \r\n\nwith  the  merits of  the  complaint.    While we  recognize  the\r\n\noccasional availability  of  such a  terpsichorean  course,  see,\r                                                                          \r\n\ne.g.,  United States v. Stoller, 78 F.3d 710, 715 (1st Cir. 1996)\r                                         \r\n\n(explaining  that a court  may bypass a  difficult jurisdictional\r\n\nquestion  and instead dispose of the  case on the merits if doing\r\n\nso  favors the party  challenging the court's  jurisdiction); see\r                                                                           \r\n\nalso Rojas v. Fitch,      F.3d    ,     (1st Cir.  1997) [No. 96-\r                             \r\n\n2328, slip op. at 7]  (employing Stoller principle to sidestep an\r                                                  \r\n\ninquiry   into  standing),  in  this  appellate  lambada  we  are\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nreluctant to follow suit.  Standing is a threshold issue in every\r\n\nfederal case and goes directly to a court's power to entertain an\r\n\naction.   See Warth  v.  Seldin, 422  U.S. 490,  498 (1975);  New\r                                                                           \r\n\nHampshire  Right to Life  Political Action  Comm. v.  Gardner, 99\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d 8, 12 (1st Cir. 1996).  Moreover, the general rule is that a\r\n\ncourt should first  confirm the  existence of  rudiments such  as\r\n\njurisdiction  and  standing  before  tackling  the  merits  of  a\r\n\ncontroverted case.  The exception discussed in Stoller is exactly\r                                                                \r\n\nthat    an  exception,  which, in  light  of the  danger  that an\r\n\nensuing decision on  the merits might be rendered  sterile by the\r\n\ntribunal's lack of authority to  resolve the case, should be used\r\n\nsparingly.   Resort should not be made to the exception where, as\r\n\nhere,  no  substantial  doubt attaches  to  the  threshold issue.\r\n\nHence, we  choose to confront  and resolve the  standing question\r\n\nbefore proceeding to the merits.2\r\n\nIII.  STANDING\r          III.  STANDING\r\n\n          The  criteria  for  standing are  well-rehearsed.    To\r\n\nestablish that  a dispute qualifies  as an Article III  \"case\" or\r\n\n\"controversy,\"  enabling it to  obtain a federal  court audience,\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2Shortly after the  district court dismissed  Berner's suit,\r\nCongress amended 42 U.S.C.   1983 to  provide \"that in any action\r\nbrought against a  judicial officer for an act  or omission taken\r\nin  such officer's judicial capacity, injunctive relief shall not\r\nbe   granted  unless  a   declaratory  decree  was   violated  or\r\ndeclaratory relief was unavailable.\"   Pub. L. 104-317,   309(c),\r\n110  Stat.  3853 (1996).   Judge  Delahanty    presumably because\r\nBerner's  complaint  seeks  declaratory  as  well  as  injunctive\r\nredress    neither moved for  dismissal of the appeal  nor raised\r\nthe amendment as  an alternate ground for affirming the judgment.\r\nUnder the circumstances, it would  serve no useful purpose for us\r\nto set sail, uninvited, on these uncharted waters.\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nthe  party  seeking  to invoke  federal  jurisdiction  must first\r\n\ndemonstrate that \r\n\n          (1) he  or she  personally has  suffered some\r\n          actual  or threatened  injury as a  result of\r\n          the  challenged conduct;  (2) the  injury can\r\n          fairly be traced to that conduct; and (3) the\r\n          injury  likely   will  be   redressed  by   a\r\n          favorable decision from the court.\r\n\nNew Hampshire Right  to Life, 99 F.3d  at 13.  We  hasten to add,\r                                      \r\n\nhowever, that  the Court has placed  a special gloss on  cases in\r\n\nwhich a party seeks exclusively injunctive or declaratory relief.\r\n\nIn such  purlieus, standing inheres  only if the  complainant can\r\n\nshow  that he  has suffered  (or  has been  threatened with)  \"an\r\n\ninvasion of a legally protected interest which is . . .  concrete\r\n\nand particularized,\"  Lujan v.  Defenders of  Wildlife, 504  U.S.\r                                                                \r\n\n555, 560  (1992), together with \"a sufficient  likelihood that he\r\n\nwill again  be wronged in a similar way,\"  City of Los Angeles v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nLyons, 461 U.S. 95, 111 (1983).   In other words, the complainant\r               \r\n\nmust establish that  the feared harm is \"actual  or imminent, not\r\n\nconjectural or hypothetical.\"  Lujan, 504 U.S.  at 460 (citations\r                                              \r\n\nand internal quotation marks omitted).

Under\r                              \r\n\nthis rubric, courts generally insist that every complainant's tub\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nrest on  its own  bottom.   See  id.

Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 612 (1973).\r                               \r\n\n          Against  this  backdrop,  Judge  Delahanty  strives  to\r\n\npersuade us  that, even if  Berner has standing to  challenge the\r\n\nbutton  ban as  a past  violation of  his First  Amendment rights\r\n\n(say, by a  suit for money damages),  he has no standing  to seek\r\n\ndeclaratory  and injunctive relief because there is no reasonable\r\n\nlikelihood that  he will  again face  similar harm.   We  are not\r\n\nconvinced.\r\n\n          Berner is  a member  of the Maine  bar and  a full-time\r\n\npracticing  lawyer who  regularly handles  litigation.   Born  in\r\n\n1956, much of his career apparently lies ahead of him.  Moreover,\r\n\nMaine is  not California.   The superior  court is  the principal\r\n\nstatewide court of general jurisdiction, see Me. Rev.  Stat. Ann.\r                                                      \r\n\ntit. 4,   105 (West 1989), and its business is handled by a total\r\n\nof only 16 active judges.   The law of averages strongly suggests\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nthat vocational demands will bring  Berner before each and all of\r\n\nthese judges in the months and years to come.\r\n\n          To cinch matters, the parties remain philosophically on\r\n\na collision course.  Berner's  passion for political pins has not\r\n\nwaned,  and he  has  vowed  that, when  once  again afforded  the\r\n\nopportunity, he  would not  hesitate, but  for Judge  Delahanty's\r\n\nstated policy,  to  wear  a  political  button  in  the  jurist's\r\n\ncourtroom.     The   judge,  too,   remains   steadfast  in   his\r\n\ndetermination  to prohibit attorneys  from sporting such  pins in\r\n\nhis bailiwick.\r\n\n          On balance, the  combination of facts reflected  by the\r\n\nrecord persuades us that Berner  faces a realistic risk of future\r\n\nexposure to the challenged policy.   Such a risk is sufficient to\r\n\nsatisfy  not  only  the standing  requirements  that  Article III\r\n\nimposes,  but also the prudential concerns that sometimes trouble\r\n\ncourts.  See  DuBois v. United States  Dep't of Agric., 102  F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n1273, 1283 (1st  Cir. 1996); see also American  Postal Workers v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nFrank, 968 F.2d 1373, 1377 (1st Cir. 1992) (elucidating doctrinal\r               \r\n\nparameters of Lyons).\r                             \r\n\n          In  any event,  Berner  alleges  that  the  button  ban\r\n\nconstitutes  a threat  not only  to  his own  right to  political\r\n\nspeech but also to the rights of \"other citizens.\"  Thus, even if\r\n\nthese particular parties' paths  were not likely to cross  again,\r\n\nBerner  might  well  be  able  to   invoke  the  federal  courts'\r\n\njurisdiction  to seek  equitable relief  based  on the  \"judicial\r\n\nprediction\" that  the policy  may chill  the general  exercise of\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nfree  speech.

Judge Delahanty's\r                                   \r\n\nprohibition apparently applies to every court officer, and we are\r\n\nnot so struthious as to hide our eyes from the  probability that,\r\n\nas a result of such a  policy, other attorneys will refrain  from\r\n\nexpressing  opinions  by  wearing  political  paraphernalia  when\r\n\nappearing  before  this  judge.     In  itself,  this  can  be  a\r\n\nsufficiently   concrete  and   particularized  injury   to  First\r\n\nAmendment  protections  to  ground  a claim  of  standing.

See Correa-Martinez v.

Although this standard is diaphanous, it\r\n\nis not  a virtual  mirage.   To survive  a motion  to dismiss,  a\r\n\ncomplaint must set  forth \"factual allegations, either  direct or\r\n\ninferential,  respecting  each   material  element  necessary  to\r\n\nsustain recovery under some actionable  legal theory.\"  Gooley v.\r                                                                        \r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nMobil Oil  Corp., 851  F.2d 513,  515 (1st  Cir. 1988).

Thus,  to  evaluate properly  the sufficiency  of\r\n\nBerner's  complaint, we first construct a template that comprises\r\n\nthe averments  necessary to  state a claim  for violation  of the\r\n\nFirst Amendment in this context.   We then proceed to measure the\r\n\nfacts that Berner alleges in his complaint3 against this template\r\n\nto ascertain whether those facts, if proven, suffice to establish\r\n\nan entitlement to relief.\r\n\n                A.

Access to a nonpublic\r\n          forum, however, can be  restricted as long as\r\n          the restrictions are reasonable and [are] not\r\n          an  effort  to   suppress  expression  merely\r\n          because public officials oppose the speaker's\r\n          view.\r\n\nCornelius,  473 U.S.  at 800  (citations  and internal  quotation\r                   \r\n\nmarks  omitted);  accord   Perry  Educ.

Ordinarily,  a complaint,  standing  alone,  will not\r\n\nprovide a suitable  vehicle for  evaluating the  adequacy of  the\r\n\ngovernment's justification  for  restricting  speech.    In  some\r\n\ninstances, however,  the government's rationale is either clearly\r\n\nstated in  the restriction  itself or plain  from even  a cursory\r\n\nexamination of the restriction.  If the justification is apparent\r\n\nand is plausible on its face, a complainant who  hopes to survive\r\n\na motion to  dismiss must do more than  suggest conclusorily that\r\n\nthe  state has an  improper or insufficient  motivation.  Rather,\r\n\nthe complainant must allege facts that, if proven, would support,\r\n\ndirectly  or  by  fair  inference,  a finding  that  the  state's\r\n\njustification falls short of the applicable legal standard.\r\n\n              B.

A courtroom's very\r                       \r\n\nfunction  is to  provide  a  locus in  which  civil and  criminal\r\n\ndisputes can be adjudicated.  Within this staid environment,  the\r\n\npresiding judge is charged with the responsibility of maintaining\r\n\nproper  order and decorum.  In  carrying out this responsibility,\r\n\nthe judge  must ensure \"that [the] courthouse is a place in which\r\n\nrational  reflection  and  disinterested  judgment  will  not  be\r\n\ndisrupted.\"  Ryan  v.

We think  it is  beyond serious question  that the\r\n\nproper  discharge of  these responsibilities  includes the  right\r\n\n(and, indeed, the duty) to  limit, to the extent practicable, the\r\n\nappearance   of   favoritism   in   judicial   proceedings,   and\r\n\nparticularly,  the appearance of political partiality.

Emblems   of  political\r\n\nsignificance worn  by attorneys  in the courtroom  as a  means of\r\n\nespousing personal  political opinions can reasonably  be thought\r\n\nto compromise  the environment  of impartiality  and fairness  to\r\n\nwhich  every  jurist aspires.    As an  officer of  the  court, a\r\n\nlawyer's  injection  of  private  political  viewpoints  into the\r\n\ncourtroom, coupled with  the judge's toleration of  such conduct,\r\n\nnecessarily tarnishes the veneer of political imperviousness that\r\n\nideally  should cloak a  courtroom, especially when  the partisan\r\n\nsentiments are completely unrelated to the court's business.\r\n\n          Here,  Judge  Delahanty  stated  clearly  that  he  was\r\n\nordering Berner to  remove the button because participants in the\r\n\njudicial  process  ought  not  simultaneously  \"take  sides\"   in\r\n\nextraneous  political  debates.5   This  explanation is  entirely\r\n\nconsistent with a  desire to  ensure that  the courtroom  remains\r\n\nfree from the  appearance of political partisanship.   Evaluating\r\n\nthe professed justification, as we must, \"in light of the purpose\r\n\nof the forum  and all the surrounding  circumstances,\" Cornelius,\r                                                                          \r\n\n473 U.S. at 809, we  discern no reason why a judge may  not even-\r\n\nhandedly prohibit lawyers from wearing political paraphernalia in\r\n\nthe courtroom.\r\n\n          Berner labors mightily to supply  such a reason.   Most\r\n\nnotably, he asseverates that, regardless of the form and function\r\n\nof the courtroom, it  is unreasonable to prohibit  political pins\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5We consider  Judge Delahanty's  statements only insofar  as\r\nthey are reflected in the transcript appended to and incorporated\r\nby reference in the plaintiff's complaint.\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\nthat do not  have the effect of  disrupting judicial proceedings.\r\n\nAs support for this thesis, he  directs us to the Court's opinion\r\n\nin  Jews  for Jesus.    He  emphasizes  that the  Justices  there\r                             \r\n\ninvalidated  a  ban   which,  among   other  things,   proscribed\r\n\n\"nondisruptive  speech    such as  the  wearing of  a T-shirt  or\r\n\nbutton  that contains  a political  message.\"   482 U.S.  at 576.\r\n\nBerner's reliance on Jews for Jesus is mislaid.\r                                             \r\n\n          That  case  involved  an  overbreadth  challenge  to  a\r\n\nmunicipal ordinance which,  on its face, \"reache[d]  the universe\r\n\nof  expressive  activity,  and,   by  prohibiting  all  protected\r                                                                \r\n\nexpression, purport[ed] to create a virtual `First Amendment Free\r\n\nZone' at [a major airport].\"  Id.  at 575.  Not surprisingly, the\r                                           \r\n\nCourt held  that, even  if an  airport is  a nonpublic  forum, no\r\n\ngovernment  interest  could   justify  excluding  all   forms  of\r                                                               \r\n\nprotected expression from that locale.   See id.

In\r\n\naddition,  an  airport   terminal,  in   which  free   expression\r\n\npresumably   would  have  been   allowed  absent  the  challenged\r\n\nordinance,  differs  substantially  from  a  courtroom,  in which\r\n\n\"whatever right  to `free  speech' an  attorney has is  [already]\r\n\nextremely  circumscribed.\"  Gentile  v. State Bar  of Nevada, 501\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S.  1030, 1071  (1991).  For  these reasons, Jews  for Jesus is\r                                                                        \r\n\ninapposite.\r\n\n          Stripping  away  the authority  on which  Berner relies\r\n\nstill  leaves  intact   his  bareboned  contention  that   it  is\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\nunreasonable  to restrict non-disruptive  speech.  As  applied to\r\n\ncourtrooms, we think that this view is much too myopic.\r\n\n          In the first  place, the danger of disturbing a court's\r\n\nproceedings is only one acceptable  justification for restricting\r\n\nprotected  speech.   There  are others.   So  here:   even though\r\n\nBerner's button  caused no commotion,  his mere wearing of  a pin\r\n\nthat advocates a  position regarding a hotly  contested political\r\n\nissue  raises  the  specter of  politicalization  and partiality.\r\n\nMindful  of the purposes of the courtroom and Berner's role as an\r\n\nofficer of the court, we conclude  that it was reasonable for the\r\n\njudge to bar  Berner's political statement regardless  of whether\r\n\nit created a stir.  See Cornelius,  473 U.S. at 809 (finding that\r                                           \r\n\n\"avoiding  the  appearance  of political  favoritism  is  a valid\r\n\njustification for limiting speech in a nonpublic forum\").\r\n\n          There  is, moreover, a broader justification.  By their\r\n\nnature,  courtrooms  demand  intense concentration  on  important\r\n\nmatters.    Whether  or  not  disruptive,  buttons  that  display\r\n\npolitical messages are  at the very  least distracting.   Lawyers\r\n\nwho wear such emblems serve not only as vocal advocates for their\r\n\nclients in matters before the court, but also as active promoters\r\n\nof their  own political agendas.   If  a presiding judge  turns a\r\n\nblind  eye   to  attorneys'  espousals  of  political  sentiments\r\n\nunrelated to ongoing proceedings, clarity and continuity may well\r\n\nsuffer.   Hence, judges may take reasonable prophylactic measures\r\n\nto minimize such distractions.\r\n\n          As a  fallback  position, Berner  maintains that  Judge\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\nDelahanty's policy is not viewpoint neutral because the defendant\r\n\nbanned his  button despite having  allowed other  emblems in  the\r\n\ncourtroom, and that  this lack of  neutrality violates the  First\r\n\nAmendment.     We  disagree.    The  essence  of  viewpoint-based\r\n\ndiscrimination is the state's  decision to pick and choose  among\r\n\nsimilarly situated speakers  in order  to advance  or suppress  a\r\n\nparticular  ideology or  outlook.   See  Lamb's Chapel  v. Center\r                                                                           \r\n\nMoriches  Union Free  Sch.

Although the Free Speech Clause may\r                   \r\n\nnot  prevent  government  officials from  restricting  an  entire\r\n\ncategory of  speech based on  its content, it does  preclude such\r\n\nofficials from  selectively granting  safe passage  to speech  of\r\n\nwhich they approve while curbing speech of which they disapprove.\r\n\nSee, e.g.,  Burnham v. Ianni, 119 F.3d  668, 676 (8th Cir. 1997);\r                                      \r\n\nGay Lesbian Bisexual Alliance v.

The closest that\r\n\nthe  complaint comes  is  an  averment  that,  despite  outlawing\r\n\nBerner's  pin,  the  \"[d]efendant  has  routinely  permitted  the\r\n\nwearing  in  his  courtroom  of  other  ornamentation  supporting\r\n\ncauses,  such as  crucifixes  and insignia  for  armed forces  or\r\n\nfraternal  orders.\"    Taken  as  true,  this  averment  is   not\r\n\nsufficient to sustain a claim of viewpoint discrimination because\r\n\nBerner does not  allege that the banishment of  his political pin\r\n\nhad anything to do with  the message emblazoned on his  button or\r\n\nthat  the  causes  promoted  by  the  permitted symbols  bear  an\r\n\nideological relation to his own button-backed political viewpoint\r\n\nsuch  that  allowing these  other  emblems in  the  courtroom but\r\n\nexcluding  his pin  rationally may  be  seen as  a discriminatory\r\n\nattempt to stifle his opinion.\r\n\n          Nor can  the plaintiff  convincingly mount  a claim  of\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6In  AIDS Action Committee,  the defendant, a  state agency,\r                                         \r\nrefused  to   allow  the   plaintiff  to   post  public   service\r\nannouncements that used  \"sexual innuendo and double  entendre to\r\ncommunicate   its  message\"  anent  the  use  of  condoms  \"while\r\nsimultaneously permitting other  advertisers to communicate their\r\nmessages through these modes of expression.\"  42 F.3d at 10.  The\r\npanel  compared  the  permitted  and  prohibited  advertisements,\r\nfocusing  particularly on whether they displayed sexual images at\r\nequivalent levels  of explicitness,  and concluded  that the  two\r\nsets  of advertisements were equally suggestive.   The panel then\r\nruled that the  defendant's differential  treatment of  similarly\r\nsuggestive  advertisements  constituted  \"content  discrimination\r\nwhich gives rise  to the appearance of  viewpoint discrimination\"\r\nin violation of the First Amendment.

The lesson of AIDS Action  Committee is that\r                                                                   \r\n\nan inference of  viewpoint discrimination sometimes can  be drawn\r\n\nwhen the proscribed speech and  the permitted speech are alike in\r\n\nways  that undermine the justification asserted in support of the\r\n\nrestriction.  Here, however, the stated justification is to avoid\r\n\nthe appearance of political  partiality, and Berner's allegations\r\n\ndo not  in any  way impeach that  justification.   No substantial\r\n\nequivalency  exists between political  buttons, on the  one hand,\r\n\nand  military and  religious  emblems,  on the  second  hand.   A\r\n\npolitical button has only a single purpose:  to express a view on\r\n\na  political  candidate  or cause.    In  contrast,  military and\r\n\nreligious  symbols, standing alone,  do not expressly  advocate a\r\n\nparticular  political position, and, at best, are subject only to\r\n\nsecondary political connotations.   Such adornments have multiple\r\n\nmeanings, including but not limited to conveying allegiance to  a\r\n\nparticular  institution or a  broad band of  convictions, values,\r\n\nand  beliefs.  Thus,  because restraining partisan  expression in\r\n\nthe neutral environ of a courtroom  is a legitimate goal, a judge\r\n\nreasonably  may  decide  to  prohibit  pins  that  primarily  and\r\n\nexpressly champion  specific political  stances and  at the  same\r\n\ntime permit the  wearing of military and  religious accessories.7\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     7This case  does not require  us to address the  question of\r\nwhether, and  if so,  under what circumstances,  a judge  has the\r\npower to exclude military and  religious insignia.  We leave that\r\n\n                                20\r\r\n\nIn the circumstances of this  case, the decision not to  bar such\r\n\ntokens   does  not  compromise  the  propriety  of  an  otherwise\r\n\npermissible prohibition precluding political paraphernalia.\r\n\n          To say  more  would be  supererogatory.   Based on  the\r\n\nallegations  of  the  plaintiff's  complaint,  no   inference  of\r\n\nviewpoint bias reasonably can be drawn.\r\n\nV.  CONCLUSION\r          V.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We need go no further.8  An attorney is  free, like all\r\n\nAmericans, to hold political sentiments.  In a courtroom setting,\r\n\nhowever, lawyers have no absolute  right to wear such feelings on\r\n\ntheir sleeves  (or lapels, for  that matter).   Judge Delahanty's\r\n\npolicy of prohibiting all political pins is a reasonable means of\r\n\nensuring  the  appearance  of fairness  and  impartiality  in the\r\n\ncourtroom, and the  plaintiff has made no  supportable allegation\r\n\nthat  the restriction is viewpoint based.  Consequently, Berner's\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nquestion for another day.\r\n\n     8In  this venue,  Berner argues,  for  the first  time, that\r\nCornelius does  not supply  the appropriate  legal guidepost  for\r                   \r\nthis case.  In Berner's  newly-emergent view, Cornelius should be\r                                                                 \r\nread to affect limitations on access to public or nonpublic fora,\r\nbut not to affect limitations on speech.  Although we are tempted\r\nto hold explicitly that  this access/speech dichotomy is made  up\r\nout  of whole cloth,  we take a  simpler route.   In the district\r\ncourt, Berner  acknowledged Cornelius's  suzerainty and  conceded\r                                               \r\nrelevant  and  substantial  portions  of  the  ensuing  analysis.\r\nConsequently, he  has forfeited  his right to  argue a  new, much\r\ndifferent theory on appeal.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts, drawn from the plaintiff's verified complaint and construed in his favor, see Dartmouth Review v. Dartmouth College, 889 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir.1989), can be recounted readily.  The defendant, Thomas E. Delahanty, II, is an associate justice of the Maine Superior Court.  On October 31, 1995, Berner was seated in the gallery of Judge Delahanty's courtroom, waiting for his turn to appear before the court.  Berner wore a circular button pinned to his lapel.  The button was approximately two inches in diameter and bore the words \"No on 1--Maine Won't Discriminate.\"   This legend expressed opposition to a statewide referendum that Maine voters were scheduled to consider during the November election.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Neither the pin nor its message were related to Berner's business before the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At some point during the day's proceedings, Judge Delahanty called Berner to the bench.  The following exchange took place:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>THE COURT:  Mr. Berner ... Can you remove the political pen [sic] while you're in the courtroom?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>ATTORNEY BERNER:  Your Honor, what happened to my right to political speech?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>THE COURT:  Not in the courtroom.  We don't take sides.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>ATTORNEY BERNER:  I want the record to reflect that I don't think there's any authority for that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>THE COURT:  The courtroom is not--that may be, but the courtroom is not a political forum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>ATTORNEY BERNER:  Your honor, I want the record to reflect that I object to that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reasonably believing that he would be held in contempt if he did not comply with the court's order, Berner removed the button.  During a chambers conference later that day, the judge told Berner that he planned to perpetuate the prohibition against lawyers wearing political buttons in his courtroom unless and until he was overruled by a higher authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Berner took refuge in the United States District Court, where he sought declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (1994).  His rifle-shot complaint contained a single claim:  that the button ban violated the First Amendment.  In support of this claim Berner alleged that his button had not caused any disruption of the ongoing proceedings and that Judge Delahanty \"routinely permitted the wearing in his courtroom of other ornamentation supporting causes, such as crucifixes and insignia for armed forces or fraternal orders.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A flurry of motions ensued.  The district court denied Berner's motion for a preliminary injunction, finding an insufficient likelihood of success on the merits.  The court then addressed the defendant's motions to dismiss the action for lack of standing and failure to state an actionable claim.  The court finessed the former by assuming, without deciding, that Berner had standing to sue.  See Berner v. Delahanty, 937 F.Supp. 62, 62 (D.Me.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the legal sufficiency of the complaint, the court held that the controlling legal standard was the forum-specific analysis of Cornelius v.

Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 800, 105 S.Ct. 3439, 3447-48, 87 L.Ed.2d 567 (1985) (discussing varying levels of scrutiny applicable to governmental restrictions on speech in different fora).  See Berner, 937 F.Supp. at 63.   Because the parties \"agree[d] that the state courtroom is a nonpublic forum,\" Judge Carter found, consistent with Cornelius, that the decision to limit the wearing of political buttons \"need only be:  (1) reasonable in light of the purpose which the court serves and (2) viewpoint neutral.\"  Id. Building on this premise, the judge concluded that the restriction on political paraphernalia was a reasonable attempt to \"shield the courtroom from the inevitable appearance of politicization,\" and that there was \"no indication that [Judge Delahanty] intended to discourage one viewpoint and advance another.\"  Id. Since he perceived the button ban to be a \"reasonable viewpoint-neutral restriction,\" Judge Carter ruled that the complaint stated no claim upon which relief could be granted.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Berner assails the district court's analysis.  He maintains that the court placed undue emphasis on Cornelius;  that it erred in gauging the reasonableness of the ban;  and, finally, that it failed to give appropriate weight to the defendant's tolerance of persons wearing other politically-tinged ornamentation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. SCOPE OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We evaluate de novo a district court's dismissal of an action for failure to state a cognizable claim.  See Aulson v. Blanchard, 83 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1996).  In assaying such a dismissal, the appellate court, like the court that preceded it, must assume that the factual averments of the complaint are true and must draw all plausible inferences in the plaintiff's favor.  See Leatherman v. Tarrant Cty. Narcotics Intell. &amp; Coord.  Unit, 507 U.S. 163, 164, 113 S.Ct. 1160, 1161, 122 L.Ed.2d 517 (1993);  Dartmouth Review, 889 F.2d at 16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district court gracefully sidestepped the standing inquiry, preferring instead a pas de deux directly with the merits of the complaint.  While we recognize the occasional availability of such a terpsichorean course, see, e.g., United States v. Stoller, 78 F.3d 710, 715 (1st Cir.1996) (explaining that a court may bypass a difficult jurisdictional question and instead dispose of the case on the merits if doing so favors the party challenging the court's jurisdiction);  see also Rojas v. Fitch, 127 F.3d 184, 186-87 (1st Cir.1997) (employing Stoller principle to sidestep an inquiry into standing), in this appellate lambada we are reluctant to follow suit.  Standing is a threshold issue in every federal case and goes directly to a court's power to entertain an action.  See Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 2204-05, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975);  New Hampshire Right to Life Political Action Comm. v. Gardner, 99 F.3d 8, 12 (1st Cir.1996).  Moreover, the general rule is that a court should first confirm the existence of rudiments such as jurisdiction and standing before tackling the merits of a controverted case.  The exception discussed in Stoller is exactly that--an exception, which, in light of the danger that an ensuing decision on the merits might be rendered sterile by the tribunal's lack of authority to resolve the case, should be used sparingly.  Resort should not be made to the exception where, as here, no substantial doubt attaches to the threshold issue.  Hence, we choose to confront and resolve the standing question before proceeding to the merits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. STANDING</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The criteria for standing are well-rehearsed.  To establish that a dispute qualifies as an Article III \"case\" or \"controversy,\" enabling it to obtain a federal court audience, the party seeking to invoke federal jurisdiction must first demonstrate that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>(1) he or she personally has suffered some actual or threatened injury as a result of the challenged conduct;  (2) the injury can fairly be traced to that conduct;  and (3) the injury likely will be redressed by a favorable decision from the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">New Hampshire Right to Life, 99 F.3d at 13.   We hasten to add, however, that the Court has placed a special gloss on cases in which a party seeks exclusively injunctive or declaratory relief.  In such purlieus, standing inheres only if the complainant can show that he has suffered (or has been threatened with) \"an invasion of a legally protected interest which is ... concrete and particularized,\" Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 2136, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992), together with \"a sufficient likelihood that he will again be wronged in a similar way,\" City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 111, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 1670, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983).  In other words, the complainant must establish that the feared harm is \"actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\"  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560, 112 S.Ct. at 2136 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  It bears noting that the imminence concept, while admittedly far reaching, is bounded by its Article III purpose:  \"to ensure that the alleged injury is not too speculative.\"  Id. at 564 n. 2, 112 S.Ct. at 2138 n. 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to these benchmarks of constitutional sufficiency, standing doctrine \"also embraces prudential concerns regarding the proper exercise of federal jurisdiction.\"  United States v. AVX Corp., 962 F.2d 108, 114 (1st Cir.1992).  Under this rubric, courts generally insist that every complainant's tub rest on its own bottom.  See id.  (stating that a plaintiff ordinarily cannot sue to assert the rights of third parties).  When the First Amendment is in play, however, the Court has relaxed the prudential limitations on standing to ameliorate the risk of washing away free speech protections.  See Secretary of State of Md. v. Joseph H. Munson Co., 467 U.S. 947, 956, 104 S.Ct. 2839, 2846-47, 81 L.Ed.2d 786 (1984).  Hence, when freedom of expression is at stake:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>Litigants ... are permitted to challenge a [policy] not because their own rights of free expression are violated, but because of a judicial prediction or assumption that the [policy's] very existence may cause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 612, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 2916, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, Judge Delahanty strives to persuade us that, even if Berner has standing to challenge the button ban as a past violation of his First Amendment rights (say, by a suit for money damages), he has no standing to seek declaratory and injunctive relief because there is no reasonable likelihood that he will again face similar harm.  We are not convinced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Berner is a member of the Maine bar and a full-time practicing lawyer who regularly handles litigation.  Born in 1956, much of his career apparently lies ahead of him.  Moreover, Maine is not California.  The superior court is the principal statewide court of general jurisdiction, see Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 4, &#167; 105 (West 1989), and its business is handled by a total of only 16 active judges.  The law of averages strongly suggests that vocational demands will bring Berner before each and all of these judges in the months and years to come.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To cinch matters, the parties remain philosophically on a collision course.  Berner's passion for political pins has not waned, and he has vowed that, when once again afforded the opportunity, he would not hesitate, but for Judge Delahanty's stated policy, to wear a political button in the jurist's courtroom.  The judge, too, remains steadfast in his determination to prohibit attorneys from sporting such pins in his bailiwick.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On balance, the combination of facts reflected by the record persuades us that Berner faces a realistic risk of future exposure to the challenged policy.  Such a risk is sufficient to satisfy not only the standing requirements that Article III imposes, but also the prudential concerns that sometimes trouble courts.  See Dubois v. United States Dep't of Agric., 102 F.3d 1273, 1283 (1st Cir.1996);  see also American Postal Workers v. Frank, 968 F.2d 1373, 1377 (1st Cir.1992) (elucidating doctrinal parameters of Lyons ).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, Berner alleges that the button ban constitutes a threat not only to his own right to political speech but also to the rights of \"other citizens.\"   Thus, even if these particular parties' paths were not likely to cross again, Berner might well be able to invoke the federal courts' jurisdiction to seek equitable relief based on the \"judicial prediction\" that the policy may chill the general exercise of free speech.  Broadrick, 413 U.S. at 612, 93 S.Ct. at 2915-16.   Judge Delahanty's prohibition apparently applies to every court officer, and we are not so struthious as to hide our eyes from the probability that, as a result of such a policy, other attorneys will refrain from expressing opinions by wearing political paraphernalia when appearing before this judge.  In itself, this can be a sufficiently concrete and particularized injury to First Amendment protections to ground a claim of standing.  See Virginia v. American Booksellers Ass'n, Inc., 484 U.S. 383, 392-93, 108 S.Ct. 636, 642-43, 98 L.Ed.2d 782 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. THE MERITS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In attempting to ascertain whether the district court erred in granting the defendant's motion to dismiss the action for failure to state a claim, Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), we must assume that the complaint's factual averments are true and determine from that coign of vantage whether the pleading encompasses any set of facts that would entitle the plaintiff to relief.  See Correa-Martinez v. Arrillaga-Belendez, 903 F.2d 49, 52 (1st Cir.1990) (explaining that an affirmance of a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal is appropriate \"only if it clearly appears, according to the facts alleged, that the plaintiff cannot recover on any viable theory\").  Although this standard is diaphanous, it is not a virtual mirage.  To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must set forth \"factual allegations, either direct or inferential, respecting each material element necessary to sustain recovery under some actionable legal theory.\"  Gooley v. Mobil Oil Corp., 851 F.2d 513, 515 (1st Cir.1988).  It is, moreover, settled that in judging the adequacy of a plaintiff's allegations, \"bald assertions, periphrastic circumlocutions, unsubstantiated conclusions, [and] outright vituperation\" carry no weight.  Correa-Martinez, 903 F.2d at 52.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These rules of pleading and practice cannot be applied in a vacuum.  Thus, to evaluate properly the sufficiency of Berner's complaint, we first construct a template that comprises the averments necessary to state a claim for violation of the First Amendment in this context.  We then proceed to measure the facts that Berner alleges in his complaint<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> against this template to ascertain whether those facts, if proven, suffice to establish an entitlement to relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>A. The First Amendment Framework.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is axiomatic that not every limitation on freedom of expression insults the First Amendment.  A curtailment of speech violates the Free Speech Clause only if the restricted expression is, in fact, constitutionally protected, see Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 571-72, 62 S.Ct. 766, 768-69, 86 L.Ed. 1031 (1942), and if the government's justification for the restriction is inadequate, see International Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness v. Lee, 505 U.S. 672, 678, 112 S.Ct. 2701, 2705, 120 L.Ed.2d 541 (1992).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Cornelius, the Court articulated a three-tiered, forum-based test for determining when the government's interest in limiting particular property to its intended purpose outweighs the interests of those who wish to use the property for expressive purposes:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>[S]peakers can be excluded from a public forum only when the exclusion is necessary to serve a compelling state interest and the exclusion is narrowly drawn to achieve that interest.  Similarly, when the Government has intentionally designated a place or means of communication as a public forum speakers cannot be excluded without a compelling governmental interest.  Access to a nonpublic forum, however, can be restricted as long as the restrictions are reasonable and [are] not an effort to suppress expression merely because public officials oppose the speaker's view.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 800, 105 S.Ct. at 3448 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted);  accord Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educators' Ass'n, 460 U.S. 37, 45-46, 103 S.Ct. 948, 954-56, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983).  Thus, when a plaintiff seeks to launch a First Amendment challenge addressed to a policy or practice that restricts expressive activity on public property, he must plead facts sufficient to show (1) that the government has burdened a protected form of speech, and (2) that the restriction is unreasonable (which, in a nonpublic forum, may involve showing that the restriction is biased, and, in public or limited public fora, may involve showing that it is not narrowly drawn to further a compelling state interest).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appeal before us arises in a slightly awkward posture.  Ordinarily, a complaint, standing alone, will not provide a suitable vehicle for evaluating the adequacy of the government's justification for restricting speech.  In some instances, however, the government's rationale is either clearly stated in the restriction itself or plain from even a cursory examination of the restriction.  If the justification is apparent and is plausible on its face, a complainant who hopes to survive a motion to dismiss must do more than suggest conclusorily that the state has an improper or insufficient motivation.  Rather, the complainant must allege facts that, if proven, would support, directly or by fair inference, a finding that the state's justification falls short of the applicable legal standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>B. The Sufficiency of the Complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to the sufficiency of the instant complaint.  As to the nature of the speech, we conclude that the complaint adequately alleges infringement of a constitutionally protected form of expression--the plaintiff's right to advocate a particular political position by wearing an emblem.  See Board of Airport Commissioners v. Jews for Jesus, 482 U.S. 569, 576, 107 S.Ct. 2568, 2573, 96 L.Ed.2d 500 (1987);  Tinker v. Des Moines Indep.  Community School Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 505, 89 S.Ct. 733, 735-36, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969).  Such political expression is typical of the broad spectrum of symbolic acts that the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment is designed to protect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Berner does not fare as well when the spotlight shifts to the apparent justification for the restriction.  A courthouse--and, especially, a courtroom--is a nonpublic forum.  See United States v. Bader, 698 F.2d 553, 556 (1st Cir.1983);  Claudio v. United States, 836 F.Supp. 1219, 1224-25 (E.D.N.C.1993), aff'd, 28 F.3d 1208 (4th Cir.1994).  A courtroom's very function is to provide a locus in which civil and criminal disputes can be adjudicated.  Within this staid environment, the presiding judge is charged with the responsibility of maintaining proper order and decorum.  In carrying out this responsibility, the judge must ensure \"that [the] courthouse is a place in which rational reflection and disinterested judgment will not be disrupted.\"  Ryan v. County of DuPage, 45 F.3d 1090, 1095 (7th Cir.1995).  We think it is beyond serious question that the proper discharge of these responsibilities includes the right (and, indeed, the duty) to limit, to the extent practicable, the appearance of favoritism in judicial proceedings, and particularly, the appearance of political partiality.  Cf. Greer v. Spock, 424 U.S. 828, 839, 96 S.Ct. 1211, 1218, 47 L.Ed.2d 505 (1976) (finding that a ban on political speeches and demonstrations on military bases \"is wholly consistent with the American constitutional tradition of a politically neutral military establishment under civilian control\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Delahanty's order compelling Berner to remove his political-advocacy button while in the courtroom fits comfortably within this apolitical paradigm.  Emblems of political significance worn by attorneys in the courtroom as a means of espousing personal political opinions can reasonably be thought to compromise the environment of impartiality and fairness to which every jurist aspires.  As an officer of the court, a lawyer's injection of private political viewpoints into the courtroom, coupled with the judge's toleration of such conduct, necessarily tarnishes the veneer of political imperviousness that ideally should cloak a courtroom, especially when the partisan sentiments are completely unrelated to the court's business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Judge Delahanty stated clearly that he was ordering Berner to remove the button because participants in the judicial process ought not simultaneously \"take sides\" in extraneous political debates.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  This explanation is entirely consistent with a desire to ensure that the courtroom remains free from the appearance of political partisanship.  Evaluating the professed justification, as we must, \"in light of the purpose of the forum and all the surrounding circumstances,\" Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 809, 105 S.Ct. at 3453, we discern no reason why a judge may not even-handedly prohibit lawyers from wearing political paraphernalia in the courtroom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Berner labors mightily to supply such a reason.  Most notably, he asseverates that, regardless of the form and function of the courtroom, it is unreasonable to prohibit political pins that do not have the effect of disrupting judicial proceedings.  As support for this thesis, he directs us to the Court's opinion in Jews for Jesus.   He emphasizes that the Justices there invalidated a ban which, among other things, proscribed \"nondisruptive speech--such as the wearing of a T-shirt or button that contains a political message.\"  482 U.S. at 576, 107 S.Ct. at 2573.   Berner's reliance on Jews for Jesus is mislaid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That case involved an overbreadth challenge to a municipal ordinance which, on its face, \"reache[d] the universe of expressive activity, and, by prohibiting all protected expression, purport[ed] to create a virtual 'First Amendment Free Zone' at [a major airport].\"  Id. at 574, 107 S.Ct. at 2572.   Not surprisingly, the Court held that, even if an airport is a nonpublic forum, no government interest could justify excluding all forms of protected expression from that locale.  See id.   The prohibition here is hardly of such unbridled scope, and, in all events, the plaintiff has not attacked it as overbroad or vague.  In addition, an airport terminal, in which free expression presumably would have been allowed absent the challenged ordinance, differs substantially from a courtroom, in which \"whatever right to 'free speech' an attorney has is [already] extremely circumscribed.\"  Gentile v. State Bar of Nevada, 501 U.S. 1030, 1071, 111 S.Ct. 2720, 2743, 115 L.Ed.2d 888 (1991).  For these reasons, Jews for Jesus is inapposite.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stripping away the authority on which Berner relies still leaves intact his bareboned contention that it is unreasonable to restrict non-disruptive speech.  As applied to courtrooms, we think that this view is much too myopic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first place, the danger of disturbing a court's proceedings is only one acceptable justification for restricting protected speech.  There are others.  So here:  even though Berner's button caused no commotion, his mere wearing of a pin that advocates a position regarding a hotly contested political issue raises the specter of politicalization and partiality.  Mindful of the purposes of the courtroom and Berner's role as an officer of the court, we conclude that it was reasonable for the judge to bar Berner's political statement regardless of whether it created a stir.  See Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 809, 105 S.Ct. at 3453 (finding that \"avoiding the appearance of political favoritism is a valid justification for limiting speech in a nonpublic forum\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is, moreover, a broader justification.  By their nature, courtrooms demand intense concentration on important matters.  Whether or not disruptive, buttons that display political messages are at the very least distracting.  Lawyers who wear such emblems serve not only as vocal advocates for their clients in matters before the court, but also as active promoters of their own political agendas.  If a presiding judge turns a blind eye to attorneys' espousals of political sentiments unrelated to ongoing proceedings, clarity and continuity may well suffer.  Hence, judges may take reasonable prophylactic measures to minimize such distractions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a fallback position, Berner maintains that Judge Delahanty's policy is not viewpoint neutral because the defendant banned his button despite having allowed other emblems in the courtroom, and that this lack of neutrality violates the First Amendment.  We disagree.  The essence of viewpoint-based discrimination is the state's decision to pick and choose among similarly situated speakers in order to advance or suppress a particular ideology or outlook.  See Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free Sch. Dist., 508 U.S. 384, 393-94, 113 S.Ct. 2141, 2147-48, 124 L.Ed.2d 352 (1993);  Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 806, 105 S.Ct. at 3451.   Although the Free Speech Clause may not prevent government officials from restricting an entire category of speech based on its content, it does preclude such officials from selectively granting safe passage to speech of which they approve while curbing speech of which they disapprove.  See, e.g., Burnham v. Ianni, 119 F.3d 668, 676 (8th Cir.1997);  Gay Lesbian Bisexual Alliance v. Pryor, 110 F.3d 1543, 1549 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This requirement of viewpoint neutrality prohibits the state both \"from regulating speech when the specific motivating ideology or the opinion or perspective of the speaker is the rationale for the restriction,\" Rosenberger v. Rector &amp; Visitors of the Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 829, 115 S.Ct. 2510, 2516, 132 L.Ed.2d 700 (1995), and from treating differently comparable means of expression when the nature of the speech is the linchpin of the limitation, see AIDS Action Comm. of Mass., Inc. v. Mass.  Bay Transp. Auth., 42 F.3d 1, 9-12 (1st Cir.1994).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  This case does not implicate either of these iterations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is simply no basis in the complaint for an inference that ideology sparked the button ban.  The closest that the complaint comes is an averment that, despite outlawing Berner's pin, the \"[d]efendant has routinely permitted the wearing in his courtroom of other ornamentation supporting causes, such as crucifixes and insignia for armed forces or fraternal orders.\"   Taken as true, this averment is not sufficient to sustain a claim of viewpoint discrimination because Berner does not allege that the banishment of his political pin had anything to do with the message emblazoned on his button or that the causes promoted by the permitted symbols bear an ideological relation to his own button-backed political viewpoint such that allowing these other emblems in the courtroom but excluding his pin rationally may be seen as a discriminatory attempt to stifle his opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor can the plaintiff convincingly mount a claim of viewpoint bias based on the prohibition of his political speech in the courtroom without a corresponding disallowance of military and religious ornamentation (which, in his view, also advance political causes).  The lesson of AIDS Action Committee is that an inference of viewpoint discrimination sometimes can be drawn when the proscribed speech and the permitted speech are alike in ways that undermine the justification asserted in support of the restriction.  Here, however, the stated justification is to avoid the appearance of political partiality, and Berner's allegations do not in any way impeach that justification.  No substantial equivalency exists between political buttons, on the one hand, and military and religious emblems, on the second hand.  A political button has only a single purpose:  to express a view on a political candidate or cause.  In contrast, military and religious symbols, standing alone, do not expressly advocate a particular political position, and, at best, are subject only to secondary political connotations.  Such adornments have multiple meanings, including but not limited to conveying allegiance to a particular institution or a broad band of convictions, values, and beliefs.  Thus, because restraining partisan expression in the neutral environ of a courtroom is a legitimate goal, a judge reasonably may decide to prohibit pins that primarily and expressly champion specific political stances and at the same time permit the wearing of military and religious accessories.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  In the circumstances of this case, the decision not to bar such tokens does not compromise the propriety of an otherwise permissible prohibition precluding political paraphernalia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more would be supererogatory.

In a courtroom setting, however, lawyers have no absolute right to wear such feelings on their sleeves (or lapels, for that matter).  Judge Delahanty's policy of prohibiting all political pins is a reasonable means of ensuring the appearance of fairness and impartiality in the courtroom, and the plaintiff has made no supportable allegation that the restriction is viewpoint based.  Consequently, Berner's complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The referendum sought to prohibit the passage of laws that condemned discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.

Judge Delahanty--presumably because Berner's complaint seeks declaratory as well as injunctive redress--neither moved for dismissal of the appeal nor raised the amendment as an alternate ground for affirming the judgment.

The panel compared the permitted and prohibited advertisements, focusing particularly on whether they displayed sexual images at equivalent levels of explicitness, and concluded that the two sets of advertisements were equally suggestive.

Although we are tempted to hold explicitly that this access/speech dichotomy is made up out of whole cloth, we take a simpler route.  In the district court, Berner acknowledged Cornelius 's suzerainty and conceded relevant and substantial portions of the ensuing analysis.  Consequently, he has forfeited his right to argue a new, much different theory on appeal.  See McCoy v. Massachusetts Inst. of Tech., 950 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir.1991);  Clauson v.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts, drawn from the plaintiff's verified complaint and construed in his favor, see Dartmouth Review v. Dartmouth College, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531870\"><a href=\"/opinion/531870/the-dartmouth-review-on-behalf-of-its-officers-staff-and-subscribers-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir.1989), can be recounted readily.  The defendant, Thomas E. Delahanty, II, is an associate justice of the Maine Superior Court.  On October 31, 1995, Berner was seated in the gallery of Judge Delahanty's courtroom, waiting for his turn to appear before the court.  Berner wore a circular button pinned to his lapel.  The button was approximately two inches in diameter and bore the words \"No on 1--Maine Won't Discriminate.\"   This legend expressed opposition to a statewide referendum that Maine voters were scheduled to consider during the November election.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Neither the pin nor its message were related to Berner's business before the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At some point during the day's proceedings, Judge Delahanty called Berner to the bench.  The following exchange took place:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>THE COURT:  Mr. Berner ... Can you remove the political pen [sic] while you're in the courtroom?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>ATTORNEY BERNER:  Your Honor, what happened to my right to political speech?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>THE COURT:  Not in the courtroom.  We don't take sides.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>ATTORNEY BERNER:  I want the record to reflect that I don't think there's any authority for that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>THE COURT:  The courtroom is not--that may be, but the courtroom is not a political forum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>ATTORNEY BERNER:  Your honor, I want the record to reflect that I object to that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reasonably believing that he would be held in contempt if he did not comply with the court's order, Berner removed the button.  During a chambers conference later that day, the judge told Berner that he planned to perpetuate the prohibition against lawyers wearing political buttons in his courtroom unless and until he was overruled by a higher authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Berner took refuge in the United States District Court, where he sought declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (1994).  His rifle-shot complaint contained a single claim:  that the button ban violated the First Amendment.  In support of this claim Berner alleged that his button had not caused any disruption of the ongoing proceedings and that Judge Delahanty \"routinely permitted the wearing in his courtroom of other ornamentation supporting causes, such as crucifixes and insignia for armed forces or fraternal orders.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A flurry of motions ensued.  The district court denied Berner's motion for a preliminary injunction, finding an insufficient likelihood of success on the merits.  The court then addressed the defendant's motions to dismiss the action for lack of standing and failure to state an actionable claim.  The court finessed the former by assuming, without deciding, that Berner had standing to sue.  See Berner v. Delahanty, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">937</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></span>, 62 (D.Me.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the legal sufficiency of the complaint, the court held that the controlling legal standard was the forum-specific analysis of Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense and Educ. Fund, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111517\"><a href=\"/opinion/111517/cornelius-v-naacp-legal-defense-ed-fund-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">788</span></a></span>, 800, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111517\"><a href=\"/opinion/111517/cornelius-v-naacp-legal-defense-ed-fund-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

See Berner, 937 F.Supp. at 63.   Because the parties \"agree[d] that the state courtroom is a nonpublic forum,\" Judge Carter found, consistent with Cornelius, that the decision to limit the wearing of political buttons \"need only be:  (1) reasonable in light of the purpose which the court serves and (2) viewpoint neutral.\"  Id. Building on this premise, the judge concluded that the restriction on political paraphernalia was a reasonable attempt to \"shield the courtroom from the inevitable appearance of politicization,\" and that there was \"no indication that [Judge Delahanty] intended to discourage one viewpoint and advance another.\"  Id. Since he perceived the button ban to be a \"reasonable viewpoint-neutral restriction,\" Judge Carter ruled that the complaint stated no claim upon which relief could be granted.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Berner assails the district court's analysis.  He maintains that the court placed undue emphasis on Cornelius;  that it erred in gauging the reasonableness of the ban;  and, finally, that it failed to give appropriate weight to the defendant's tolerance of persons wearing other politically-tinged ornamentation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. SCOPE OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We evaluate de novo a district court's dismissal of an action for failure to state a cognizable claim.  See Aulson v. Blanchard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"717572\"><a href=\"/opinion/717572/alan-aulson-et-ux-maureen-aulson-v-charles-blanchard/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.1996).  In assaying such a dismissal, the appellate court, like the court that preceded it, must assume that the factual averments of the complaint are true and must draw all plausible inferences in the plaintiff's favor.  See Leatherman v. Tarrant Cty. Narcotics Intell. &amp; Coord.  Unit, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112825\"><a href=\"/opinion/112825/leatherman-v-tarrant-county-narcotics-intelligence-and-coordination-unit/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">163</span></a></span>, 164, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112825\"><a href=\"/opinion/112825/leatherman-v-tarrant-county-narcotics-intelligence-and-coordination-unit/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></a></span> (1993);  Dartmouth Review, 889 F.2d at 16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district court gracefully sidestepped the standing inquiry, preferring instead a pas de deux directly with the merits of the complaint.  While we recognize the occasional availability of such a terpsichorean course, see, e.g., United States v. Stoller, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"714794\"><a href=\"/opinion/714794/united-states-v-robert-s-stoller/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">710</span></a></span>, 715 (1st Cir.1996) (explaining that a court may bypass a difficult jurisdictional question and instead dispose of the case on the merits if doing so favors the party challenging the court's jurisdiction);  see also Rojas v. Fitch, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"747150\"><a href=\"/opinion/747150/unemplinsrep-cch-p-22198-guadalupe-rojas-v-lawrence-fitch-guadalupe/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">184</span></a></span>, 186-87 (1st Cir.1997) (employing Stoller principle to sidestep an inquiry into standing), in this appellate lambada we are reluctant to follow suit.  Standing is a threshold issue in every federal case and goes directly to a court's power to entertain an action.  See Warth v. Seldin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109301\"><a href=\"/opinion/109301/warth-v-seldin/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">490</span></a></span>, 498, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109301\"><a href=\"/opinion/109301/warth-v-seldin/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Moreover, the general rule is that a court should first confirm the existence of rudiments such as jurisdiction and standing before tackling the merits of a controverted case.  The exception discussed in Stoller is exactly that--an exception, which, in light of the danger that an ensuing decision on the merits might be rendered sterile by the tribunal's lack of authority to resolve the case, should be used sparingly.  Resort should not be made to the exception where, as here, no substantial doubt attaches to the threshold issue.  Hence, we choose to confront and resolve the standing question before proceeding to the merits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. STANDING</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The criteria for standing are well-rehearsed.  To establish that a dispute qualifies as an Article III \"case\" or \"controversy,\" enabling it to obtain a federal court audience, the party seeking to invoke federal jurisdiction must first demonstrate that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>(1) he or she personally has suffered some actual or threatened injury as a result of the challenged conduct;  (2) the injury can fairly be traced to that conduct;  and (3) the injury likely will be redressed by a favorable decision from the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">New Hampshire Right to Life, 99 F.3d at 13.   We hasten to add, however, that the Court has placed a special gloss on cases in which a party seeks exclusively injunctive or declaratory relief.  In such purlieus, standing inheres only if the complainant can show that he has suffered (or has been threatened with) \"an invasion of a legally protected interest which is ... concrete and particularized,\" Lujan v.

We are not convinced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Berner is a member of the Maine bar and a full-time practicing lawyer who regularly handles litigation.  Born in 1956, much of his career apparently lies ahead of him.  Moreover, Maine is not California.  The superior court is the principal statewide court of general jurisdiction, see Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 4, &#167; 105 (West 1989), and its business is handled by a total of only 16 active judges.  The law of averages strongly suggests that vocational demands will bring Berner before each and all of these judges in the months and years to come.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To cinch matters, the parties remain philosophically on a collision course.  Berner's passion for political pins has not waned, and he has vowed that, when once again afforded the opportunity, he would not hesitate, but for Judge Delahanty's stated policy, to wear a political button in the jurist's courtroom.  The judge, too, remains steadfast in his determination to prohibit attorneys from sporting such pins in his bailiwick.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On balance, the combination of facts reflected by the record persuades us that Berner faces a realistic risk of future exposure to the challenged policy.  Such a risk is sufficient to satisfy not only the standing requirements that Article III imposes, but also the prudential concerns that sometimes trouble courts.  See Dubois v.

Broadrick, 413 U.S. at 612, 93 S.Ct. at 2915-16.   Judge Delahanty's prohibition apparently applies to every court officer, and we are not so struthious as to hide our eyes from the probability that, as a result of such a policy, other attorneys will refrain from expressing opinions by wearing political paraphernalia when appearing before this judge.  In itself, this can be a sufficiently concrete and particularized injury to First Amendment protections to ground a claim of standing.  See Virginia v.

Thus, when a plaintiff seeks to launch a First Amendment challenge addressed to a policy or practice that restricts expressive activity on public property, he must plead facts sufficient to show (1) that the government has burdened a protected form of speech, and (2) that the restriction is unreasonable (which, in a nonpublic forum, may involve showing that the restriction is biased, and, in public or limited public fora, may involve showing that it is not narrowly drawn to further a compelling state interest).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appeal before us arises in a slightly awkward posture.  Ordinarily, a complaint, standing alone, will not provide a suitable vehicle for evaluating the adequacy of the government's justification for restricting speech.  In some instances, however, the government's rationale is either clearly stated in the restriction itself or plain from even a cursory examination of the restriction.  If the justification is apparent and is plausible on its face, a complainant who hopes to survive a motion to dismiss must do more than suggest conclusorily that the state has an improper or insufficient motivation.  Rather, the complainant must allege facts that, if proven, would support, directly or by fair inference, a finding that the state's justification falls short of the applicable legal standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>B.

A courtroom's very function is to provide a locus in which civil and criminal disputes can be adjudicated.  Within this staid environment, the presiding judge is charged with the responsibility of maintaining proper order and decorum.  In carrying out this responsibility, the judge must ensure \"that [the] courthouse is a place in which rational reflection and disinterested judgment will not be disrupted.\"  Ryan v.

We think it is beyond serious question that the proper discharge of these responsibilities includes the right (and, indeed, the duty) to limit, to the extent practicable, the appearance of favoritism in judicial proceedings, and particularly, the appearance of political partiality.

Emblems of political significance worn by attorneys in the courtroom as a means of espousing personal political opinions can reasonably be thought to compromise the environment of impartiality and fairness to which every jurist aspires.  As an officer of the court, a lawyer's injection of private political viewpoints into the courtroom, coupled with the judge's toleration of such conduct, necessarily tarnishes the veneer of political imperviousness that ideally should cloak a courtroom, especially when the partisan sentiments are completely unrelated to the court's business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Judge Delahanty stated clearly that he was ordering Berner to remove the button because participants in the judicial process ought not simultaneously \"take sides\" in extraneous political debates.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  This explanation is entirely consistent with a desire to ensure that the courtroom remains free from the appearance of political partisanship.  Evaluating the professed justification, as we must, \"in light of the purpose of the forum and all the surrounding circumstances,\" Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 809, 105 S.Ct. at 3453, we discern no reason why a judge may not even-handedly prohibit lawyers from wearing political paraphernalia in the courtroom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Berner labors mightily to supply such a reason.  Most notably, he asseverates that, regardless of the form and function of the courtroom, it is unreasonable to prohibit political pins that do not have the effect of disrupting judicial proceedings.  As support for this thesis, he directs us to the Court's opinion in Jews for Jesus.   He emphasizes that the Justices there invalidated a ban which, among other things, proscribed \"nondisruptive speech--such as the wearing of a T-shirt or button that contains a political message.\"  482 U.S. at 576, 107 S.Ct. at 2573.

Not surprisingly, the Court held that, even if an airport is a nonpublic forum, no government interest could justify excluding all forms of protected expression from that locale.  See id.   The prohibition here is hardly of such unbridled scope, and, in all events, the plaintiff has not attacked it as overbroad or vague.  In addition, an airport terminal, in which free expression presumably would have been allowed absent the challenged ordinance, differs substantially from a courtroom, in which \"whatever right to 'free speech' an attorney has is [already] extremely circumscribed.\"  Gentile v.

So here:  even though Berner's button caused no commotion, his mere wearing of a pin that advocates a position regarding a hotly contested political issue raises the specter of politicalization and partiality.  Mindful of the purposes of the courtroom and Berner's role as an officer of the court, we conclude that it was reasonable for the judge to bar Berner's political statement regardless of whether it created a stir.  See Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 809, 105 S.Ct. at 3453 (finding that \"avoiding the appearance of political favoritism is a valid justification for limiting speech in a nonpublic forum\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is, moreover, a broader justification.  By their nature, courtrooms demand intense concentration on important matters.  Whether or not disruptive, buttons that display political messages are at the very least distracting.  Lawyers who wear such emblems serve not only as vocal advocates for their clients in matters before the court, but also as active promoters of their own political agendas.  If a presiding judge turns a blind eye to attorneys' espousals of political sentiments unrelated to ongoing proceedings, clarity and continuity may well suffer.  Hence, judges may take reasonable prophylactic measures to minimize such distractions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a fallback position, Berner maintains that Judge Delahanty's policy is not viewpoint neutral because the defendant banned his button despite having allowed other emblems in the courtroom, and that this lack of neutrality violates the First Amendment.  We disagree.  The essence of viewpoint-based discrimination is the state's decision to pick and choose among similarly situated speakers in order to advance or suppress a particular ideology or outlook.

Although the Free Speech Clause may not prevent government officials from restricting an entire category of speech based on its content, it does preclude such officials from selectively granting safe passage to speech of which they approve while curbing speech of which they disapprove.  See, e.g., Burnham v. Ianni, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744115\"><a href=\"/opinion/744115/albert-burnham-ronald-marchese-michael-kohn-louise-kohn-v-lawrence-ianni/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span>, 676 (8th Cir.1997);  Gay Lesbian Bisexual Alliance v.

Mass.  Bay Transp. Auth., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"684073\"><a href=\"/opinion/684073/aids-action-committee-of-massachusetts-inc-v-massachusetts-bay/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 9-12 (1st Cir.1994).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  This case does not implicate either of these iterations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is simply no basis in the complaint for an inference that ideology sparked the button ban.  The closest that the complaint comes is an averment that, despite outlawing Berner's pin, the \"[d]efendant has routinely permitted the wearing in his courtroom of other ornamentation supporting causes, such as crucifixes and insignia for armed forces or fraternal orders.\"   Taken as true, this averment is not sufficient to sustain a claim of viewpoint discrimination because Berner does not allege that the banishment of his political pin had anything to do with the message emblazoned on his button or that the causes promoted by the permitted symbols bear an ideological relation to his own button-backed political viewpoint such that allowing these other emblems in the courtroom but excluding his pin rationally may be seen as a discriminatory attempt to stifle his opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor can the plaintiff convincingly mount a claim of viewpoint bias based on the prohibition of his political speech in the courtroom without a corresponding disallowance of military and religious ornamentation (which, in his view, also advance political causes).  The lesson of AIDS Action Committee is that an inference of viewpoint discrimination sometimes can be drawn when the proscribed speech and the permitted speech are alike in ways that undermine the justification asserted in support of the restriction.  Here, however, the stated justification is to avoid the appearance of political partiality, and Berner's allegations do not in any way impeach that justification.  No substantial equivalency exists between political buttons, on the one hand, and military and religious emblems, on the second hand.  A political button has only a single purpose:  to express a view on a political candidate or cause.  In contrast, military and religious symbols, standing alone, do not expressly advocate a particular political position, and, at best, are subject only to secondary political connotations.  Such adornments have multiple meanings, including but not limited to conveying allegiance to a particular institution or a broad band of convictions, values, and beliefs.  Thus, because restraining partisan expression in the neutral environ of a courtroom is a legitimate goal, a judge reasonably may decide to prohibit pins that primarily and expressly champion specific political stances and at the same time permit the wearing of military and religious accessories.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  In the circumstances of this case, the decision not to bar such tokens does not compromise the propriety of an otherwise permissible prohibition precluding political paraphernalia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more would be supererogatory.

In a courtroom setting, however, lawyers have no absolute right to wear such feelings on their sleeves (or lapels, for that matter).  Judge Delahanty's policy of prohibiting all political pins is a reasonable means of ensuring the appearance of fairness and impartiality in the courtroom, and the plaintiff has made no supportable allegation that the restriction is viewpoint based.  Consequently, Berner's complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The referendum sought to prohibit the passage of laws that condemned discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.

Judge Delahanty--presumably because Berner's complaint seeks declaratory as well as injunctive redress--neither moved for dismissal of the appeal nor raised the amendment as an alternate ground for affirming the judgment.  Under the circumstances, it would serve no useful purpose for us to set sail, uninvited, on these uncharted waters</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Rule 12(b)(6) provides in pertinent part that if, on a motion to dismiss, \"matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56.\"   Here, the parties submitted affidavits subsequent to the filing of the complaint, but the district court apparently did not rest its decision in any way on these materials (and, thus, effectively excluded them).

The panel compared the permitted and prohibited advertisements, focusing particularly on whether they displayed sexual images at equivalent levels of explicitness, and concluded that the two sets of advertisements were equally suggestive.  The panel then ruled that the defendant's differential treatment of similarly suggestive advertisements constituted \"content discrimination which gives rise to the appearance of viewpoint discrimination\" in violation of the First Amendment.

In Berner's newly-emergent view, Cornelius should be read to affect limitations on access to public or nonpublic fora, but not to affect limitations on speech.  Although we are tempted to hold explicitly that this access/speech dichotomy is made up out of whole cloth, we take a simpler route.  In the district court, Berner acknowledged Cornelius 's suzerainty and conceded relevant and substantial portions of the ensuing analysis.  Consequently, he has forfeited his right to argue a new, much different theory on appeal.  See McCoy v.
