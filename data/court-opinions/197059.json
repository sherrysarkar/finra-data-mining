Petitioner  Reynaldo  Restrepo Contreras,\r                            \r\n\nhaving persuaded the district court to reduce his sentence in\r\n\nlight   of  a   retroactive   amendment  to   the  sentencing\r\n\nguidelines, complains  on appeal  that the court  should have\r\n\nfurther  reduced his  sentence pursuant  to  a nonretroactive\r\n\namendment.  We disagree and therefore affirm.\r\n\n     In  1990,  petitioner  was  convicted  of  two  offenses\r\n\ninvolving cocaine base and sentenced to 360 months in prison.\r\n\nThis  court affirmed  the  judgment on  direct  appeal.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited States  v.

In February 1994,\r                               \r\n\npetitioner filed  a motion under  28 U.S.C.   2255  or in the\r\n\nalternative under 18 U.S.C.   3582(c)(2), seeking a reduction\r\n\nof sentence  because of  two amendments  to U.S.S.G.    2D1.1\r\n\nthat  had taken effect the  previous November.   One of these\r\n\n(amendment 484)  defined the  term \"mixture or  substance\" to\r\n\nexclude materials  that must  be separated from  a controlled\r\n\nsubstance  before that  substance  could be  used; the  other\r\n\n(amendment 487) defined the term cocaine base to mean \"crack\"\r\n\ncocaine.  Amendment  484 was included in U.S.S.G.    1B1.10's\r\n\nlisting of amendments that  may be considered for retroactive\r\n\napplication; amendment 487 was not.\r\n\n     In a  February 1996  ruling, the district  court granted\r\n\nthe motion in part.  Relying  on amendment 484, as well as on\r\n\na later amendment that retroactively reduced the maximum base\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\noffense  level  (amendment 505),  the court  recalculated the\r\n\ndrug quantity, reconfigured the applicable offense level, and\r\n\nreduced petitioner's  sentence to 235 months--the  low end of\r\n\nthe revised  sentencing range.  The  court declined, however,\r\n\nto  invoke  amendment  487  due to  its  prospective  nature.\r\n\nContrary  to petitioner's  claim,  this latter  determination\r\n\nentailed no error.\r\n\n     \"Resentencing\" in the   3582(c)(2)  context is different\r\n\nfrom that  which occurs  when an  appellate  court vacates  a\r\n\nsentence  and  remands  for  resentencing.    In  the  latter\r\n\nsituation, the lower  court normally is to apply  the version\r\n\nof  the guidelines  in  effect at  the  time of  resentencing\r\n\n(absent ex post facto concerns).  See, e.g., United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nGraham, 83 F.3d 1466, 1482 (D.C. Cir. 1996); United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nCanon,  66  F.3d 1073,  1076  n.1 (9th  Cir.  1995).   For   \r                 \r\n\n3582(c)(2) determinations, the guidelines dictate a different\r\n\napproach.  Section 1B1.10(b) instructs the court to \"consider\r\n\nthe sentence  that it would have imposed had the amendment(s)\r\n\nto the guidelines listed in subsection  (c) [i.e., those that\r\n\nhave  been designated as  retroactive] been in  effect at the\r\n\ntime  the  defendant was  sentenced.\"    And an  accompanying\r\n\napplication note states:\r\n\n     In  determining the  amended guideline  range under\r\n     subsection (b), the court shall substitute only the\r                                                                \r\n     amendments  listed   in  subsection  (c)   for  the\r\n     corresponding   guideline   provisions  that   were\r\n     applied  when  the defendant  was  sentenced.   All\r                                                                    \r\n     otherguidelineapplicationdecisionsremainunaffected.\r                                                                   \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nU.S.S.G.   1B1.10 n.2  (emphasis added).  In  accordance with\r\n\nthese directions, the district court properly  refrained from\r\n\napplying amendment 487.\r\n\n     In the alternative, petitioner argues that amendment 487\r\n\nis a \"clarifying\" rather  than \"substantive\" amendment  which\r\n\nmay properly  be invoked on  a retroactive basis,  whether in\r\n\nconnection with a   3582(c)(2) resentencing or by way of a   \r\n\n2255  proceeding.  See,  e.g., Isabel  v. United  States, 980\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d  60,  62 (1st  Cir. 1992).    Yet courts  have uniformly\r\n\ncharacterized amendment  487 as  a substantive change.   See,\r                                                                        \r\n\ne.g.,  United States v.

Samuels,  59 F.3d 526, 529 (5th Cir. 1995).  We agree with\r                      \r\n\nthat  assessment, especially  since  the amendment  conflicts\r\n\nwith this court's  holding in United States v. Lopez-Gil, 965\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 1124,  1134-35 (1st Cir.)

A  reduction of\r\n\nsentence  thus  need  not  invariably  be  accompanied  by  a\r\n\nhearing.  See, e.g., United States v. Dimeo, 28 F.3d 240, 241\r                                                       \r\n\nn.3 (1st Cir. 1994); see also United States v.

Having\r                    \r\n\nexamined  the issues that  petitioner wished to  argue to the\r\n\nresentencing court, we find that each of them would have been\r\n\nunavailing.  \r\n\n     We have considered  the remaining arguments  advanced by\r\n\npetitioner on appeal and summarily  reject them as lacking in\r\n\nmerit. \r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                          \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n",

We disagree and therefore affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1990, petitioner was convicted of two offenses involving cocaine base and sentenced to 360 months in prison.  This court affirmed the judgment on direct appeal.   See United States v. Restrepo-Contreras, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566805\"><a href=\"/opinion/566805/united-states-v-reynaldo-de-jesus-restrepo-contreras/\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1066</span></span> (1992).  In February 1994, petitioner filed a motion under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 or in the alternative under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3582(c)(2), seeking a reduction of sentence because of two amendments to U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1 that had taken effect the previous November.  One of these (amendment 484) defined the term \"mixture or substance\" to exclude materials that must be separated from a controlled substance before that substance could be used;  the other (amendment 487) defined the term cocaine base to mean \"crack\" cocaine.  Amendment 484 was included in U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.10's listing of amendments that may be considered for retroactive application;  amendment 487 was not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a February 1996 ruling, the district court granted the motion in part.  Relying on amendment 484, as well as on a later amendment that retroactively reduced the maximum base offense level (amendment 505), the court recalculated the drug quantity, reconfigured the applicable offense level, and reduced petitioner's sentence to 235 months--the low end of the revised sentencing range.  The court declined, however, to invoke amendment 487 due to its prospective nature.  Contrary to petitioner's claim, this latter determination entailed no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Resentencing\" in the &#167; 3582(c)(2) context is different from that which occurs when an appellate court vacates a sentence and remands for resentencing.  In the latter situation, the lower court normally is to apply the version of the guidelines in effect at the time of resentencing (absent ex post facto concerns).   See, e.g., United States v. Graham, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"718316\"><a href=\"/opinion/718316/united-states-v-perry-a-graham-united-states-of-america-v-terrence-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1466</span></a></span>, 1482 (D.C.Cir.1996);   United States v. Canon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"705147\"><a href=\"/opinion/705147/95-cal-daily-op-serv-7580-95-daily-journal-dar-13004-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1073</span></a></span>, 1076 n. 1 (9th Cir.1995).  For &#167; 3582(c)(2) determinations, the guidelines dictate a different approach.  Section 1B1.10(b) instructs the court to \"consider the sentence that it would have imposed had the amendment(s) to the guidelines listed in subsection (c) [i.e., those that have been designated as retroactive] been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced.\"   And an accompanying application note states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining the amended guideline range under subsection (b), the court shall substitute only the amendments listed in subsection (c) for the corresponding guideline provisions that were applied when the defendant was sentenced.  All other guideline application decisions remain unaffected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.10 n. 2 (emphasis added).  In accordance with these directions, the district court properly refrained from applying amendment 487.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the alternative, petitioner argues that amendment 487 is a \"clarifying\" rather than \"substantive\" amendment which may properly be invoked on a retroactive basis, whether in connection with a &#167; 3582(c)(2) resentencing or by way of a &#167; 2255 proceeding.   See, e.g., Isabel v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"595487\"><a href=\"/opinion/595487/maurice-isabel-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span>, 62 (1st Cir.1992).  Yet courts have uniformly characterized amendment 487 as a substantive change.   See, e.g., United States v. Booker, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"708088\"><a href=\"/opinion/708088/united-states-v-henry-booker/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">488</span></a></span>, 489-90 (7th Cir.1995), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1334</span></span> (1996);   United States v. Kissick, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"707581\"><a href=\"/opinion/707581/united-states-v-charles-michael-kissick/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1048</span></a></span>, 1053 (10th Cir.1995);   United States v. Samuels, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"7398\"><a href=\"/opinion/7398/united-states-v-samuels/\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">526</span></a></span>, 529 (5th Cir.1995).  We agree with that assessment, especially since the amendment conflicts with this court's holding in  United States v. Lopez-Gil, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584140\"><a href=\"/opinion/584140/united-states-v-jesus-m-lopez-gil/\"><span class=\"volume\">965</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1124</span></a></span>, 1134-35 (1st Cir.)  (on rehearing), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">981</span></span> (1992).   See, e.g., United States v. Rostoff, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196027\"><a href=\"/opinion/196027/united-states-v-rostoff/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span>, 406 (1st Cir.1995) (deeming an amendment to be substantive when it is at odds with prevailing circuit precedent).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner's further contention--that he was improperly denied the right to a hearing--is misplaced.  \"A &#167; 3582(c)(2) motion is not a second opportunity to present mitigating factors to the sentencing judge, nor is it a challenge to the appropriateness of the original sentence.\"   United States v.  Whitebird, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"696589\"><a href=\"/opinion/696589/united-states-v-malcolm-jones-whitebird/\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1007</span></a></span>, 1011 (5th Cir.1995) (finding no right to counsel in connection therewith).  A reduction of sentence thus need not invariably be accompanied by a hearing.   See, e.g., United States v. Dimeo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195474\"><a href=\"/opinion/195474/united-states-v-dimeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">240</span></a></span>, 241 n. 3 (1st Cir.1994);   see also United States v. De Los Santos-Himitola, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555049\"><a href=\"/opinion/555049/united-states-v-jose-de-los-santos-himitola-walber-meza-navarro-pedro/\"><span class=\"volume\">924</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">380</span></a></span>, 382-83 (1st Cir.1991).  Having examined the issues that petitioner wished to argue to the resentencing court, we find that each of them would have been unavailing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have considered the remaining arguments advanced by petitioner on appeal and summarily reject them as lacking in merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
