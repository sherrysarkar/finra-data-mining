Defendant-appellant Carl Baylis\n\nappeals the district court's decision that a seven-year-old state\n\nprobate court finding should be given preclusive effect in the\n\nsubsequent adversarial bankruptcy court proceeding. We vacate and\n\nremand.\n\n                                 I.\n\n          In October 1969, Baylis, an attorney specializing in taxation\n\nand estate planning, created a trust (the “Trust”) for Antonia\n\nQuevillon. Baylis included in the agreement an exculpatory clause\n\nwhich provided that the Trustees would be “liable only for [their] own\n\nwillful conduct or omissions in bad faith.”      The res of the Trust\n\nconsisted of two apartment buildings in Worcester, Massachusetts, and\n\nsix in Southbridge, Massachusetts. The Trust provided that Quevillon\n\nwould serve as trustee and that upon her death, Estelle Ballard and\n\nBaylis would serve as co-trustees. Ballard was one of Quevillon's\n\ndaughters and was, along with her siblings--plaintiffs-appellees\n\nConstance Rutanen, Robert Quevillon,1 and Theresa Alexander (the\n\n“plaintiffs”)--an income beneficiary of the Trust. Ballard had agreed\n\n\n     1\n     The estate of Robert Quevillon is represented in this action by\nElla Quevillon.\n\n                                 -2-\n\fwith her mother to be paid fifty dollars per week for the management of\n\nthe properties. Baylis was paid only for specific work he performed\n\nfor the Trust.\n\n          During the life of the Trust, net income was to be\n\ndistributed equally among the beneficiaries.       Twenty years after\n\nAntonia Quevillon's death, the Trust was to terminate, and the Trust\n\nproperty was to be divided equally among the children of her son\n\nMarcel. The Trust terminated on May 20, 1991, and the Trust property\n\nwas distributed to Marcel Quevillon's children.\n\n          Upon Antonia Quevillon's death in 1971, Ballard and Baylis\n\nsold one of the properties to pay estate taxes. Over the next fifteen\n\nyears, the Trust paid the beneficiaries modest amounts. In 1985, the\n\nplaintiffs, concerned because of the minute amounts they were receiving\n\nfrom the Trust, met with Ballard and Baylis to discuss its operation.\n\nBy then, both Worcester buildings had been sold, but the Trust still\n\nheld the six Southbridge buildings. At this meeting, it was agreed,\n\nwith no objection from Ballard, that the co-trustees would sell the\n\nremaining properties and invest the proceeds in treasury notes.\n\n          By January 1986, Ballard and Baylis had received offers for\n\nthe properties. A Mr. and Mrs. John Young made an offer for two of the\n\nproperties, and Ramshorn Realty Trust (“Ramshorn”) offered to buy the\n\nother four. The total price offered for the six buildings totaled\n\n$1,640,000, which was $300,000 greater than the properties' appraised\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fvalues.   Ballard then decided not to sell any of the properties,\n\nclaiming that she wanted to keep them for herself. Because Baylis\n\nbelieved that the real estate market had peaked, he urged the sale of\n\nthe properties, but Ballard remained steadfast in her refusal to sell.\n\nIn February 1986, in an attempt to complete the transactions before an\n\nincrease in the federal capital gains tax became effective, Baylis\n\nfirst offered Ballard a chance to buy all the property, which she was\n\nunable to do because she lacked financing, and then offered her an\n\nadditional management fee of either $75,000 or $133,667 if she would\n\nassent to the sale. She refused. Nevertheless, despite her refusal,\n\nBaylis presented unsigned purchase and sale agreements to the Youngs in\n\nMay 1986 and to Ramshorn in June 1986.     Both parties executed and\n\nreturned the agreements to Baylis.\n\n          After he received the signed purchase and sale agreements,\n\nBaylis attempted to garner Ballard's signature on them. She refused,\n\nprompting Baylis to propose to her that the Trust would sell the two\n\nproperties earmarked for the Youngs to her instead. In return, she was\n\nto assent to the sale of the other four properties to Ramshorn, resign\n\nas co-trustee, and agree to a trustee fee for Baylis. Ballard agreed.\n\n\n\n          In December 1986, when the Youngs became aware of this\n\narrangement, they sued Baylis for fraud and Ballard and Baylis, in\n\ntheir capacities as co-trustees, for specific performance. Ballard\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fthen withdrew her agreement with Baylis and refused to sell the four\n\nproperties to Ramshorn. The properties, therefore, remained unsold.\n\nBallard and Baylis used Trust funds to finance their defense of the\n\nYoung litigation.    Jointly, they spent approximately $12,000 in\n\ndefending themselves as co-trustees, with Baylis spending approximately\n\n$7000 to defend himself against the fraud claim. Finally, to settle\n\nits litigation the Trust paid $15,000 to the Youngs in connection with\n\ntheir fraud claim against Baylis.\n\n          That same December, Baylis filed with the probate court a\n\npetition for a license to sell the properties on behalf of the Trust.\n\nThe probate court decided to defer acting on the petition until Ballard\n\ngave her consent to sell. She never did. Baylis thereafter failed to\n\npursue the petition even though he believed that Ballard's reason for\n\nrefusing to sell was baseless and that her refusal constituted a breach\n\nof fiduciary duty. Consequently, the property was not sold. Within a\n\nshort time, property values in the area fell, and the value of the\n\nTrust was diminished.\n\n          In May 1988, the plaintiffs sued Ballard and Baylis in\n\nMassachusetts Probate Court. The plaintiffs sought an accounting and\n\nalleged breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, fraud, and negligent\n\nmisrepresentation. After a bench trial, the court found that Baylis\n\nhad acted negligently in failing to prevent Ballard from fulfilling her\n\nfiduciary duties. In addition, it found that the exculpatory clause in\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fthe Trust Agreement was unenforceable and that, in failing to sell the\n\nproperties, Ballard and Baylis had acted in bad faith. The trial court\n\nentered judgment for $330,079.95 against Ballard and Baylis.\n\n          The Massachusetts Appeals Court affirmed the judgment of the\n\nprobate court with respect to both its negligence and bad faith\n\ndeterminations. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts (“SJC”)\n\ngranted Ballard and Baylis's application for further appellate review\n\nand affirmed. In so doing, however, the court expressly refused to\n\nreach the issue of bad faith, stating that a finding of negligent\n\nbreach of fiduciary duty would suffice to affirm the judgment. Baylis\n\nsubsequently filed a petition for rehearing in which he requested,\n\ninter alia, that the SJC reverse the trial court's finding of bad\n\nfaith.   The SJC denied the petition.\n\n          Following the SJC's affirmance, Baylis filed for bankruptcy.\n\nThe plaintiffs opposed the discharge of his judgment debt to them and\n\nbrought an adversary action pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 523(a). This\n\nsection of the Bankruptcy Code prohibits the discharge of any debt\n\narising from “defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity,” id.\n\n§ 523(a)(4), or from “willful and malicious injury,” id. § 523(a)(6).\n\nThe parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment,2 agreeing to be\n\nbound by the probate court's factual findings, except for the finding\n\n     2Although they styled their motions as ones for “summary\njudgment,” it is evident that they expected the bankruptcy court simply\nto resolve the case on a stipulated record.\n\n                                 -6-\n\fthat Baylis acted in bad faith.      The plaintiffs argued that the\n\nbankruptcy court should accord this finding preclusive effect, but the\n\ncourt disagreed.    The court went on to find neither willful and\n\nmalicious injury nor defalcation. Therefore, the court held that\n\nBaylis's debt to the plaintiffs was dischargeable and entered judgment\n\nto Baylis in the adversary action.\n\n          The plaintiffs appealed to the district court, arguing that\n\nthe bankruptcy court had erred in its determination that issue\n\npreclusion did not apply to the probate court's determination of bad\n\nfaith. In a Memorandum and Order dated October 29, 1999, the district\n\ncourt reversed the holding of the bankruptcy court, holding that issue\n\npreclusion did apply. It further held that the finding of bad faith\n\nunder Massachusetts law required concomitant findings of defalcation\n\nand willful and malicious injury under the Bankruptcy Code.\n\nConsequently, it reversed and ordered that judgment be entered in favor\n\nof the plaintiffs.    This appeal followed.\n\n                                 II.\n\n          The sole issue before us is whether the district court was\n\ncorrect in ruling that the bankruptcy court should have given\n\npreclusive effect to the probate court's finding that Baylis had acted\n\nin bad faith. We review this ruling de novo. See IRS v. Cousins (In\n\nre Cousins), 209 F.3d 38, 40 (1st Cir. 2000); Prebor v. Collins (In re\n\nI Don't Trust), 143 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f          The plaintiffs argue that the issue of bad faith was fully\n\nand fairly litigated in the state probate court and, as such, should\n\nhave preclusive effect in the bankruptcy proceeding. In doing so, they\n\npoint out that the probate court found Baylis to have acted in bad\n\nfaith and that the appeals court affirmed this finding. Further, they\n\nargue that this finding of bad faith suffices to prove that Baylis\n\ncommitted defalcation and inflicted willful and malicious injuries on\n\nthe plaintiffs.    Baylis responds that because the probate court\n\nalternatively found that Baylis was negligent and had acted in bad\n\nfaith and because the SJC affirmed only on the negligence ground, there\n\nwas no preclusive final judgment on the issue of bad faith. Thus, we\n\nmust decide whether issue preclusion applies when a trial court's\n\njudgment, which rests on alternative grounds, is affirmed by the\n\nintermediate appeals court on both grounds, but by the court of last\n\nresort on only one ground.\n\n          It is well-settled that a previously litigated issue between\n\ntwo parties should not be relitigated. See Montana v. United States,\n\n440 U.S. 147, 153 (1979); Miles v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 589 N.E.2d\n\n314, 316-17 (Mass. 1992). The principles of issue preclusion apply to\n\nnondischargeability proceedings in bankruptcy. See Grogan v. Garner,\n\n498 U.S. 279, 285 n.11 (1991).         By federal statute, judicial\n\nproceedings in state court “shall have the same full faith and credit\n\nin every court within the United States . . . as they have by law or\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fusage in the courts of such State.” 28 U.S.C. § 1738. Therefore, in\n\na case such as this, we employ Massachusetts issue preclusion law. See\n\nKyricopoulos v. Town of Orleans, 967 F.2d 14, 16 (1st Cir. 1992) (per\n\ncuriam). And, as we previously have noted, Massachusetts courts follow\n\nthe traditional rules for the doctrine of issue preclusion.        See\n\nWillhauck v. Halpin, 953 F.2d 689, 705 (1st Cir. 1991) (citing Martin\n\nv. Ring, 514 N.E.2d 663, 664 (Mass. 1987)).\n\n          For an issue to receive preclusive effect in a later\n\nproceeding under Massachusetts law, the following four elements must be\n\npresent: (1) the issue sought to be precluded must be identical to that\n\nin the prior litigation; (2) the parties actually must have litigated\n\nthe issue; (3) the judgment regarding the issue must have been binding\n\nand valid; and (4) the issue's determination must have been essential\n\nto the judgment. See Martin, 514 N.E.2d at 664; see also Keystone\n\nShipping Co. v. New England Power Co., 109 F.3d 46, 51 (1st Cir. 1997)\n\n(noting that these four elements are required both by Massachusetts\n\ncourts and by the First Circuit).\n\n          “If a judgment of a court of first instance is based on\n\ndeterminations of two issues, either of which standing independently\n\nwould be sufficient to support the result, the judgment is not\n\nconclusive with respect to either issue standing alone,” and neither\n\nreceives preclusive effect. 1 Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 27\n\ncmt. i [hereinafter Restatement]; see also York Ford, Inc. v. Building\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fInspector & Zoning Adm'r, 647 N.E.2d 85, 87-88 (Mass. App. Ct. 1995)\n\n(adopting the rule of comment i to section 27). If, however, “the\n\nappellate court” affirms both grounds of the holding, each ground\n\nreceives preclusive effect. 1 Restatement § 27 cmt. o; see also York\n\nFord, Inc., 647 N.E.2d at 88 n.7 (adopting the rule of comment o to\n\nsection 27). On the other hand, if “the appellate court” affirms on\n\none ground and passes on the other, “the judgment is conclusive [only]\n\nas to the first determination.”      1 Restatement § 27 cmt. o.\n\n          In this case, each determination of the court of first\n\ninstance was affirmed by the appeals court, but the SJC affirmed one\n\ndetermination and explicitly passed on the other. This result appears\n\nto generate a novel complication, but because of the role the SJC plays\n\nwhen reviewing cases in this posture, the general tenets of comment o\n\napply. Strictly speaking, when the SJC reviews cases that originate in\n\nprobate court, its concern is not with the decision of the\n\nMassachusetts Appeals Court; rather, the SJC reviews the disposition of\n\nthe probate court as if the appeal came directly to it. See, e.g., In\n\nre Adoption of Hugo, 700 N.E.2d 516, 520-21 (Mass. 1998) (noting that\n\nthe SJC reviews the findings of the probate court for clear errors of\n\nlaw), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1034 (1999); White v. White, 76 N.E.2d 15,\n\n16-17 (Mass. 1947) (“All questions of law, fact and discretion are open\n\nfor our decision, and we can find facts contrary to the [probate]\n\njudge's findings if convinced that he is plainly wrong.”). In this\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fsense, when the SJC hears a case that originated in the probate court,\n\nits ruling supercedes that of the Massachusetts Appeals Court for the\n\npurposes of issue preclusion and assumes the role of “the appellate\n\ncourt” to which comment o refers.3 The SJC's determination that the bad\n\nfaith finding was unnecessary to decide the case thus vitiates any\n\nargument that the finding should receive preclusive effect.\n\n          The SJC's skeptical view of the evidence of bad faith, which\n\nit found to be “questionable,” Rutanen v. Ballard, 678 N.E.2d 133, 140\n\n(Mass. 1997), adds additional support to our conclusion. Alternative\n\nholdings from a court of first instance receive no preclusive effect\n\nuntil affirmed by the appellate court in part because the court of\n\nfirst instance may not have considered each determination “as carefully\n\nor rigorously” as it would have if each had been essential to the\n\nresult. 1 Restatement § 27 cmt. i. Once the losing party has obtained\n\nan appellate decision on the issue, however, “the balance weighs in\n\nfavor of preclusion” because the appellate court has reviewed and\n\nupheld the determinations of the court of first instance.        1 id.\n\n\n\n     3Moreover, an opinion of the Massachusetts Appeals Court is not a\n“decision” binding on the parties until its rescript issues to the\nlower court. See Commonwealth v. Aboulaz, 688 N.E.2d 1374, 1377 (Mass.\nApp. Ct.), review denied, 692 N.E.2d 963 (Mass. 1998). But in this\ncase, the rescript of the appeals court never issued to the probate\ncourt because “[i]f an application of further appellate review is\ngranted the rescript of the Appeals Court shall not issue to the lower\ncourt.” Mass. R. App. P. 23. Because the appeals court's opinion\nnever became a binding decision, the SJC is the relevant appellate\ncourt for issue preclusion purposes.\n\n                                 -11-\n\fcmt. o. In other words, the alternative determination cannot have\n\npreclusive effect until the appellate court analyzes it and decides\n\nthat the court of first instance correctly resolved it. Here, the\n\nrelevant appellate court not only failed to endorse the correctness of\n\nthe finding, but it explicitly questioned it.4           Under these\n\ncircumstances, issue preclusion should not apply.\n\n                                 III.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the district court\n\nis vacated, and the case is remanded for further action consistent with\n\nthis opinion.    No costs.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n     Furthermore, comments i and o to section 27 are not meant as\nexceptions to the general rule of issue preclusion stated in that\nsection. Instead, they elucidate one of the basic elements of that\nrule, that the determination must have been “essential to the\njudgment.” In this case, however, the SJC explicitly said that the\nfinding of Baylis's bad faith was not essential to the judgment. The\nfailure to meet that element means that the finding is not entitled to\npreclusive effect.\n\n                                 -12-\n\f",

The total price offered for the six buildings totaled\n\n$1,640,000, which was $300,000 greater than the properties' appraised\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fvalues.   Ballard then decided not to sell any of the properties,\n\nclaiming that she wanted to keep them for herself. Because Baylis\n\nbelieved that the real estate market had peaked, he urged the sale of\n\nthe properties, but Ballard remained steadfast in her refusal to sell.\n\nIn February 1986, in an attempt to complete the transactions before an\n\nincrease in the federal capital gains tax became effective, Baylis\n\nfirst offered Ballard a chance to buy all the property, which she was\n\nunable to do because she lacked financing, and then offered her an\n\nadditional management fee of either $75,000 or $133,667 if she would\n\nassent to the sale. She refused. Nevertheless, despite her refusal,\n\nBaylis presented unsigned purchase and sale agreements to the Youngs in\n\nMay 1986 and to Ramshorn in June 1986.     Both parties executed and\n\nreturned the agreements to Baylis.\n\n          After he received the signed purchase and sale agreements,\n\nBaylis attempted to garner Ballard's signature on them. She refused,\n\nprompting Baylis to propose to her that the Trust would sell the two\n\nproperties earmarked for the Youngs to her instead. In return, she was\n\nto assent to the sale of the other four properties to Ramshorn, resign\n\nas co-trustee, and agree to a trustee fee for Baylis. Ballard agreed.\n\n\n\n          In December 1986, when the Youngs became aware of this\n\narrangement, they sued Baylis for fraud and Ballard and Baylis, in\n\ntheir capacities as co-trustees, for specific performance. Ballard\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fthen withdrew her agreement with Baylis and refused to sell the four\n\nproperties to Ramshorn. The properties, therefore, remained unsold.\n\nBallard and Baylis used Trust funds to finance their defense of the\n\nYoung litigation.    Jointly, they spent approximately $12,000 in\n\ndefending themselves as co-trustees, with Baylis spending approximately\n\n$7000 to defend himself against the fraud claim. Finally, to settle\n\nits litigation the Trust paid $15,000 to the Youngs in connection with\n\ntheir fraud claim against Baylis.\n\n          That same December, Baylis filed with the probate court a\n\npetition for a license to sell the properties on behalf of the Trust.\n\nThe probate court decided to defer acting on the petition until Ballard\n\ngave her consent to sell. She never did. Baylis thereafter failed to\n\npursue the petition even though he believed that Ballard's reason for\n\nrefusing to sell was baseless and that her refusal constituted a breach\n\nof fiduciary duty. Consequently, the property was not sold. Within a\n\nshort time, property values in the area fell, and the value of the\n\nTrust was diminished.\n\n          In May 1988, the plaintiffs sued Ballard and Baylis in\n\nMassachusetts Probate Court. The plaintiffs sought an accounting and\n\nalleged breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, fraud, and negligent\n\nmisrepresentation. After a bench trial, the court found that Baylis\n\nhad acted negligently in failing to prevent Ballard from fulfilling her\n\nfiduciary duties. In addition, it found that the exculpatory clause in\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fthe Trust Agreement was unenforceable and that, in failing to sell the\n\nproperties, Ballard and Baylis had acted in bad faith. The trial court\n\nentered judgment for $330,079.95 against Ballard and Baylis.\n\n          The Massachusetts Appeals Court affirmed the judgment of the\n\nprobate court with respect to both its negligence and bad faith\n\ndeterminations. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts (“SJC”)\n\ngranted Ballard and Baylis's application for further appellate review\n\nand affirmed. In so doing, however, the court expressly refused to\n\nreach the issue of bad faith, stating that a finding of negligent\n\nbreach of fiduciary duty would suffice to affirm the judgment. Baylis\n\nsubsequently filed a petition for rehearing in which he requested,\n\ninter alia, that the SJC reverse the trial court's finding of bad\n\nfaith.   The SJC denied the petition.\n\n          Following the SJC's affirmance, Baylis filed for bankruptcy.\n\nThe plaintiffs opposed the discharge of his judgment debt to them and\n\nbrought an adversary action pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 523(a). This\n\nsection of the Bankruptcy Code prohibits the discharge of any debt\n\narising from “defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity,” id.\n\n§ 523(a)(4), or from “willful and malicious injury,” id. § 523(a)(6).\n\nThe parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment,2 agreeing to be\n\nbound by the probate court's factual findings, except for the finding\n\n     2Although they styled their motions as ones for “summary\njudgment,” it is evident that they expected the bankruptcy court simply\nto resolve the case on a stipulated record.\n\n                                 -6-\n\fthat Baylis acted in bad faith.      The plaintiffs argued that the\n\nbankruptcy court should accord this finding preclusive effect, but the\n\ncourt disagreed.    The court went on to find neither willful and\n\nmalicious injury nor defalcation. Therefore, the court held that\n\nBaylis's debt to the plaintiffs was dischargeable and entered judgment\n\nto Baylis in the adversary action.\n\n          The plaintiffs appealed to the district court, arguing that\n\nthe bankruptcy court had erred in its determination that issue\n\npreclusion did not apply to the probate court's determination of bad\n\nfaith. In a Memorandum and Order dated October 29, 1999, the district\n\ncourt reversed the holding of the bankruptcy court, holding that issue\n\npreclusion did apply. It further held that the finding of bad faith\n\nunder Massachusetts law required concomitant findings of defalcation\n\nand willful and malicious injury under the Bankruptcy Code.\n\nConsequently, it reversed and ordered that judgment be entered in favor\n\nof the plaintiffs.    This appeal followed.\n\n                                 II.\n\n          The sole issue before us is whether the district court was\n\ncorrect in ruling that the bankruptcy court should have given\n\npreclusive effect to the probate court's finding that Baylis had acted\n\nin bad faith. We review this ruling de novo. See IRS v.

In doing so, they\n\npoint out that the probate court found Baylis to have acted in bad\n\nfaith and that the appeals court affirmed this finding. Further, they\n\nargue that this finding of bad faith suffices to prove that Baylis\n\ncommitted defalcation and inflicted willful and malicious injuries on\n\nthe plaintiffs.    Baylis responds that because the probate court\n\nalternatively found that Baylis was negligent and had acted in bad\n\nfaith and because the SJC affirmed only on the negligence ground, there\n\nwas no preclusive final judgment on the issue of bad faith. Thus, we\n\nmust decide whether issue preclusion applies when a trial court's\n\njudgment, which rests on alternative grounds, is affirmed by the\n\nintermediate appeals court on both grounds, but by the court of last\n\nresort on only one ground.\n\n          It is well-settled that a previously litigated issue between\n\ntwo parties should not be relitigated.

Building\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fInspector & Zoning Adm'r, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">647</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 87-88 (Mass. App. Ct. 1995)\n\n(adopting the rule of comment i to section 27). If, however, “the\n\nappellate court” affirms both grounds of the holding, each ground\n\nreceives preclusive effect. 1 Restatement § 27 cmt. o; see also York\n\nFord, Inc., 647 N.E.2d at 88 n.7 (adopting the rule of comment o to\n\nsection 27). On the other hand, if “the appellate court” affirms on\n\none ground and passes on the other, “the judgment is conclusive [only]\n\nas to the first determination.”      1 Restatement § 27 cmt. o.\n\n          In this case, each determination of the court of first\n\ninstance was affirmed by the appeals court, but the SJC affirmed one\n\ndetermination and explicitly passed on the other. This result appears\n\nto generate a novel complication, but because of the role the SJC plays\n\nwhen reviewing cases in this posture, the general tenets of comment o\n\napply. Strictly speaking, when the SJC reviews cases that originate in\n\nprobate court, its concern is not with the decision of the\n\nMassachusetts Appeals Court; rather, the SJC reviews the disposition of\n\nthe probate court as if the appeal came directly to it. See, e.g., In\n\nre Adoption of Hugo, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">700</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">516</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 520-21 (Mass. 1998) (noting that\n\nthe SJC reviews the findings of the probate court for clear errors of\n\nlaw), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1034</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1999); White v.

In this\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fsense, when the SJC hears a case that originated in the probate court,\n\nits ruling supercedes that of the Massachusetts Appeals Court for the\n\npurposes of issue preclusion and assumes the role of “the appellate\n\ncourt” to which comment o refers.3 The SJC's determination that the bad\n\nfaith finding was unnecessary to decide the case thus vitiates any\n\nargument that the finding should receive preclusive effect.\n\n          The SJC's skeptical view of the evidence of bad faith, which\n\nit found to be “questionable,” Rutanen v. Ballard, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">678</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 140\n\n(Mass. 1997), adds additional support to our conclusion. Alternative\n\nholdings from a court of first instance receive no preclusive effect\n\nuntil affirmed by the appellate court in part because the court of\n\nfirst instance may not have considered each determination “as carefully\n\nor rigorously” as it would have if each had been essential to the\n\nresult. 1 Restatement § 27 cmt. i. Once the losing party has obtained\n\nan appellate decision on the issue, however, “the balance weighs in\n\nfavor of preclusion” because the appellate court has reviewed and\n\nupheld the determinations of the court of first instance.        1 id.\n\n\n\n     3Moreover, an opinion of the Massachusetts Appeals Court is not a\n“decision” binding on the parties until its rescript issues to the\nlower court. See Commonwealth v. Aboulaz, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">688</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1374</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1377 (Mass.\nApp. Ct.), review denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">692</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">963</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Mass. 1998). But in this\ncase, the rescript of the appeals court never issued to the probate\ncourt because “[i]f an application of further appellate review is\ngranted the rescript of the Appeals Court shall not issue to the lower\ncourt.” Mass. R. App. P. 23. Because the appeals court's opinion\nnever became a binding decision, the SJC is the relevant appellate\ncourt for issue preclusion purposes.\n\n                                 -11-\n\fcmt. o. In other words, the alternative determination cannot have\n\npreclusive effect until the appellate court analyzes it and decides\n\nthat the court of first instance correctly resolved it. Here, the\n\nrelevant appellate court not only failed to endorse the correctness of\n\nthe finding, but it explicitly questioned it.4           Under these\n\ncircumstances, issue preclusion should not apply.\n\n                                 III.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the district court\n\nis vacated, and the case is remanded for further action consistent with\n\nthis opinion.    No costs.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n     Furthermore, comments i and o to section 27 are not meant as\nexceptions to the general rule of issue preclusion stated in that\nsection. Instead, they elucidate one of the basic elements of that\nrule, that the determination must have been “essential to the\njudgment.” In this case, however, the SJC explicitly said that the\nfinding of Baylis's bad faith was not essential to the judgment. The\nfailure to meet that element means that the finding is not entitled to\npreclusive effect.\n\n                                 -12-\n\f</pre>",
