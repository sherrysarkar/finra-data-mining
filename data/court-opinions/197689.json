The General  Electric Mortgage  Insurance\r                            \r\n\nCorporation (\"GEMIC\") appeals from the district court's order\r\n\naffirming the refusal of the bankruptcy court to declare non-\r\n\ndischargeable  because of fraud a debt owed to it by Peter M.\r\n\nBelli.   11 U.S.C.     523(a)(2)(A)-(B).   Unfortunately  for\r\n\nGEMIC,  the facts  now relied  upon  to show  fraud were  not\r\n\nproved  at trial in  the bankruptcy  court.   Accordingly, we\r\n\naffirm.\r\n\n     GEMIC  insured  loans   for  the  First  Mark   Mortgage\r\n\nCorporation  of Emerald Isle,  North Carolina (\"First Mark\"),\r\n\nwhich in  1990 lent  Belli $126,800,  secured by  a mortgage.\r\n\nBelli defaulted.  GEMIC made good the deficiency, First  Mark\r\n\nassigned  its rights to GEMIC, and GEMIC  in turn won a state\r\n\ncourt judgment against Belli on October 20, 1993, for the sum\r\n\nof $58,719.08, the principal amount still owed to GEMIC after\r\n\nthe  foreclosure sale of  the mortgaged property.   Belli did\r\n\nnot  pay this  sum  but instead  filed  for bankruptcy  under\r\n\nChapter 7 on February 18, 1994.\r\n\n     On  May 27,  1994, GEMIC  filed  a complaint  asking the\r\n\nbankruptcy court to declare the debt non-dischargeable on the\r\n\nground that Belli had lied on his loan application concerning\r\n\nthe  terms   of  his  employment   and  the  amount   of  his\r\n\nliabilities;  the complaint  did not  assert  that Belli  had\r\n\noverstated  his assets.  After  some discovery, a bench trial\r\n\nwas held  on July  19, 1995, which  consisted largely  of the\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\ndirect examination  and cross-examination  of Belli,  who was\r\n\nthe only witness to testify.   The bankruptcy court dismissed\r\n\nGEMIC's  complaint and later denied GEMIC's motion for relief\r\n\nfrom final  judgment.   GEMIC appealed  these rulings  to the\r\n\ndistrict court, which affirmed.\r\n\n     On  appeal, GEMIC tells us that Belli's loan application\r\n\noverstated   his  gross   monthly  income,   understated  his\r\n\noutstanding  debts,  and--most  important--misrepresented his\r\n\nownership  interest in  certain assets.    Belli had  claimed\r\n\nownership  of two  parcels of  land  valued at  $435,000; but\r\n\nGEMIC now tells us that  Belli had previously lost one parcel\r\n\ndue to foreclosure  and had conveyed most of  his interest in\r\n\nthe  other, so  that his  equity  in the  two properties  was\r\n\nactually approximately $250.\r\n\n     Had  GEMIC proved  at trial  the misrepresentations  now\r\n\ndescribed,  it would have  gone far  toward proving  that the\r\n\njudgment earlier  won  by GEMIC  was non-dischargeable  under\r\n\nsection 523.   We were surprised  therefore to discover  that\r\n\nthe  trial  record does  not  contain  proof  of the  alleged\r\n\nmisrepresentations.   Instead, it shows that the only witness\r\n\ncalled  was Belli  himself  who,  although vigorously  cross-\r\n\nexamined by  GEMIC counsel, declined  to admit that  his loan\r\n\napplication was materially false.\r\n\n     To explain the absence of  proof, GEMIC says that one of\r\n\nits own  witnesses was unexpectedly  unavailable; but  absent\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nextreme  circumstances, refusal  to defer  a scheduled  trial\r\n\nwhere a party fails  to produce its own witness is within the\r\n\nsound discretion of  the trial court.   GEMIC also  complains\r\n\nthat  the district  court refused  to enforce  a subpoena  to\r\n\nrequire  Belli's  former  employer to  appear  at  trial with\r\n\nrecords as to Belli's former  salary; but GEMIC had sought to\r\n\nserve the subpoena only the  day before trial and the witness\r\n\nwas  out  of  state.    GEMIC  had  failed  to  preserve  the\r\n\nemployer's testimony by deposition.\r\n\n     GEMIC next says that Belli did not adequately respond to\r\n\ndiscovery;  specifically,  he  failed  to  produce  prior tax\r\n\nreturns, saying they had been  lost.  But GEMIC itself waited\r\n\nuntil the last day to submit its discovery requests and, more\r\n\nimportant, did  not complain to  the trial  court until  five\r\n\ndays before trial  even though it  had had Belli's  responses\r\n\nfor a month.  Nor did GEMIC move in timely fashion  to compel\r\n\nBelli to sign an authorization so that it could itself secure\r\n\nthe tax documents from the Internal Revenue Service.\r\n\n     As  for   the  misrepresentations   concerning  property\r\n\nownership, it appears that GEMIC did not discover these facts\r\n\nuntil a title search was  performed after trial.  The results\r\n\nwere  the basis  for  GEMIC's motion  for  relief from  final\r\n\njudgment.   But  GEMIC  has  never explained  why,  with  due\r\n\ndiligence,  it could not have discovered the same information\r\n\nprior to trial.  In  these circumstances, the trial court was\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\ncertainly not obliged  to let GEMIC reopen matters  to repair\r\n\nthe record.\r\n\n     This case involved a relatively small sum for GEMIC and,\r\n\neven  if   it  had   prevailed  in   making  the   debt  non-\r\n\ndischargeable, it  might never have  seen a  penny.   Perhaps\r\n\nthis  justified it  in  stinting  on  trial  preparation  and\r\n\ngambling that Belli  might be forced on  cross-examination to\r\n\nadmit the  necessary facts.   But having gambled and  lost in\r\n\nthe trial court, GEMIC cannot expect rescue on appeal.\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                         \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n",
