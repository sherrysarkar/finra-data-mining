Moreno pled guilty  to narcotics\r\n\noffenses  under 21 U.S.C.     841(a)(1) &amp; 846  arising from their\r\n\nparticipation in a cocaine  conspiracy.  At issue in  this appeal\r\n\nare their claims of sentencing errors.  \r\n\n     Both defendants challenge  the district court's  decision to\r\n\nhold  them  responsible  for   over  five  kilograms  of  cocaine\r\n\n(implicating  the ten  year minimum  sentence  under 21  U.S.C.  \r\n\n841(b)(1)(A)(ii)),  and   the  court's  refusal  to   conduct  an\r\n\nevidentiary  hearing.     Jimenez  also   contests  the   court's\r\n\ndetermination that his disclosure to  a probation officer did not\r\n\nsatisfy  the   requirements  of  the   \"safety  valve\"  provision\r\n\ncontained in U.S.S.G.    5C1.2, which permits a judge to impose a\r\n\nsentence below  the statutory  minimum.  Finally,  Moreno asserts\r\n\nthat  the  evidence  was  insufficient  to  warrant  a  two-level\r\n\nenhancement for  obstruction of  justice.  Having  concluded that\r\n\nthe   court  considered   insufficiently  reliable   evidence  in\r\n\ndetermining the  quantity of cocaine attributable  to Jimenez, we\r\n\nvacate his sentence and remand for resentencing.  As to all other\r\n\nissues, we affirm. \r\n\n                           BACKGROUND1\r\n\nFacts\r               \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1   We set forth the  facts as derived from  the uncontested\r\nportions of the Presentence Report (PSR),  the transcripts of the\r\nsentencing  hearings, see United States v. Dietz, 950 F.2d 50, 51\r                                                          \r\n(1st  Cir. 1991), and the  evidence adduced at  trial, see United\r                                                                           \r\nStates v. Hanono-Surujun, 914 F.2d 15, 19 (1st Cir. 1990).    \r                                  \r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n     Defendants' involvement in the  conspiracy began in the fall\r\n\nof  1993,  with  co-conspirator Christopher  Fazio's  efforts  to\r\n\nbroker a five-kilogram cocaine deal with an undercover agent.  In\r\n\nan  attempt to secure a  source for the  cocaine, Fazio contacted\r\n\nMoreno, who responded that he \"would come through with the deal.\"\r\n\nA  meeting ensued between Moreno,  Fazio and the  agent, where in\r\n\ncontemplation of the five-kilogram deal, the  parties agreed to a\r\n\npreliminary one-kilogram  purchase to take place  on November 10,\r\n\n1993.  On  November 9,  Moreno introduced Fazio  to Jimenez,  the\r\n\n\"man who worked  for him, that delivers  coke for him, and .  . .\r\n\n[who] was the transporter.\"  On November 10, Jimenez, accompanied\r\n\nby Fazio, delivered one kilogram of cocaine to the agent.\r\n\n     On December 30,  further negotiations between  Fazio, Moreno\r\n\nand  the agent took place.   Moreno proposed  splitting the five-\r\n\nkilogram  transaction into  two separate  sales.  After  two more\r\n\nmeetings,  the  five-kilogram  deal, to  be  broken  up into  two\r\n\nseparate transactions, was scheduled for February 2, 1994.\r\n\n     On the  morning of  February 2, Moreno  spotted surveillance\r\n\nagents outside his home, and cancelled the deal.  Upon hearing of\r\n\nthe   cancellation,  the  agents  left  their  positions  outside\r\n\nMoreno's and  Jimenez's homes, but  returned a short  time later.\r\n\nAt that time,  Jimenez was observed  entering his home,  followed\r\n\nshortly thereafter  by co-conspirator  Gabriel Uroujo  Perez, who\r\n\nwas carrying an empty  shoulder bag.  Uroujo  exited with a  full\r\n\nshoulder bag, later  found to  contain just over  2 kilograms  of\r\n\ncocaine.   A  search of  Jimenez's  home uncovered  an additional\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n123.8  grams of  cocaine.   The three  kilograms that  would have\r\n\ncompleted the transaction were never found.\r\n\n     Jimenez  pled  guilty to  conspiracy to  distribute cocaine,\r\n\ndistribution of cocaine, and possession of cocaine with intent to\r\n\ndistribute.   Moreno  went to  trial, but,  after the  government\r\n\nrested its case, pled guilty to conspiracy to distribute cocaine,\r\n\nand distribution of cocaine.\r\n\nSentencing:  Jimenez\r                              \r\n\n     The  probation   department  determined  that   Jimenez  was\r\n\naccountable for  3.2615 kilograms of cocaine --  the one kilogram\r\n\nsold on November 10,  1993 and the cocaine recovered  on February\r\n\n2, 1994.  The government objected, contending that Jimenez should\r\n\nbe  liable for the whole  five kilograms negotiated.   On January\r\n\n24,  1995, in  response to  the government's  objections, Jimenez\r\n\nrequested an  evidentiary hearing and order to the Government \"to\r\n\npresent  any  witnesses  it intends  to  use  in  support of  its\r\n\nobjections.\"  This motion was denied. \r\n\n     Jimenez's sentencing  hearing took  place on April  3, 1995.\r\n\nIn   support  of   its   position,  the   government  relied   on\r\n\ncircumstantial  evidence and  one  piece of  direct evidence,  an\r\n\naffidavit from co-defendant Ramin Mojabi, prepared on February 6,\r\n\n1995, which stated that Jimenez was present during a December 30,\r\n\n1993  meeting with Moreno and Fazio, and took part in discussions\r\n\nconcerning the five-kilogram deal. \r\n\n     Notwithstanding  Jimenez's  challenges  to  the  affidavit's\r\n\nreliability, the court found that Jimenez was aware of the object\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nof the  conspiracy, the  five-kilogram deal, and  was, therefore,\r\n\nresponsible for the whole five kilograms.  In addition, the court\r\n\ndenied  Jimenez the benefit of  U.S.S.G   5C1.2,  which permits a\r\n\ncourt  to  impose  punishment  without regard  to  the  statutory\r\n\nminimum sentence.  While Jimenez had provided  information to the\r\n\nprobation  department,  he  did  not apprise  the  United  States\r\n\nAttorney's Office, and  the court, therefore,  found that he  had\r\n\nnot  informed  the  \"Government\"   as  required  by     5C1.2(5).\r\n\nConsequently, Jimenez was subject to the 10 year minimum sentence\r\n\n-- not the  applicable guideline range of 70-87 months -- and was\r\n\nsentenced accordingly to 120 months incarceration. \r\n\nSentencing:  Moreno\r                             \r\n\n     Moreno's  sentencing hearings  took  place on  March 23  and\r\n\nApril  6, 1995.   On March 13, the  court denied Moreno's motions\r\n\nfor an evidentiary hearing  and for issuance of subpoenas  to co-\r\n\nconspirators Jimenez and  Uroujo to  appear as  witnesses at  his\r\n\nsentencing.  At the first hearing, Moreno testified that his role\r\n\nin the  conspiracy was limited to  playacting the role  of a drug\r\n\ndealer  in  order to  assist Fazio.    He further  contended that\r\n\nbecause  he did not have the capability to produce the additional\r\n\nthree kilograms of  cocaine on February 2,  he could not  be held\r\n\nresponsible for  the total  negotiated amount of  five kilograms.\r\n\nThe court  rejected these  arguments, finding  Moreno responsible\r\n\nfor  over five kilograms, and increasing his offense level by two\r\n\nin  accordance with his  role as a manager  and supervisor in the\r\n\nconspiracy.  See U.S.S.G.   3B1.1(c).  \r                          \r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n     The court further  found that Moreno  had phoned Fazio,  and\r\n\nMoreno's  wife  had visited  Fazio,  in  an effort  to  influence\r\n\nFazio's  testimony at  Moreno's  trial.   Accordingly, the  court\r\n\nenhanced  Moreno's   offense   level  another   two  levels   for\r\n\nobstruction of  justice.   Moreno  was  sentenced to  188  months\r\n\nincarceration.\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r\n\nA.   Sentencing Issues:  Jimenez\r                                          \r\n\n     1.

We review quantity\r\n\ndeterminations  for clear error.   See United States  v. St. Cyr,\r                                                                          \r\n\n977 F.2d 698, 701 (1st Cir. 1992).\r\n\n      Jimenez admits agreeing to  store two kilograms of cocaine,\r\n\nbut denies having any knowledge whatsoever of the secondary three\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nkilogram  transaction.    He  advances  three  related  arguments\r\n\nagainst  the court's  decision  holding him  accountable for  the\r\n\nwhole  five kilograms  negotiated.   First,  he  claims that  the\r\n\nMojabi  affidavit  was  unreliable   and  should  not  have  been\r\n\nconsidered by  the court.   Second, he  argues that, at  the very\r\n\nleast,  the  court should  have  staged  an evidentiary  hearing.\r\n\nFinally,  he contends  that, without  the affidavit,  the court's\r\n\ndetermination was clearly erroneous.  \r\n\nThe Mojabi Affidavit\r                              \r\n\n     The Mojabi  affidavit was the only piece  of direct evidence\r\n\nlinking  Jimenez to the five-kilogram  deal.2  In  order to place\r\n\nthe  affidavit  in  context,  we  first  provide  in  detail  the\r\n\ncircumstantial evidence  before the court that,  according to the\r\n\ngovernment, demonstrated Jimenez's awareness of the deal:\r\n\n     1.  Jimenez was  introduced to Fazio as the  person who\r\n     worked for, and transported cocaine for, Moreno.\r\n\n     2.   Moreno told the undercover  agent that he intended\r\n     to  use  Jimenez in  connection with  the five-kilogram\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2  Mojabi's affidavit, in pertinent part, provided:\r\n\n          On the evening  of December 30,  1993, Christopher\r\n     Fazio took  me to Moreno's home.   \"Fernando\" [Jimenez]\r\n     was  also there.   Moreno,  Fazio, and  \"Fernando\" were\r\n     discussing the sale of five kilograms of cocaine to the\r\n     undercover  agent; they  were  talking  about how  many\r\n     kilograms to sell at  one time.  Moreno stated  that he\r\n     could  get as  much  as they  wanted  in New  York  and\r\n     \"Fernando\" stated that he would deliver the cocaine and\r\n     take  the money.   \"Fernando\"  stated that he  had done\r\n     this  before, that he was  not afraid, and  that he did\r\n     not need a  gun.   \"Fernando\" also stated  that he  had\r\n     previously lived  in New York  and that the  people who\r\n     owned the cocaine  trusted him  and had used  him as  a\r\n     courier in the past. . . .\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\n     sale, and  Jimenez stored the first  installment of two\r\n     kilograms in his home.\r\n\n     3.   Moreno told the agent that Jimenez had modified an\r\n     automobile to  transport up  to ten kilograms;  such an\r\n     automobile was parked in Jimenez's driveway on February\r\n     2, 1995.\r\n\n     4.   Moreno  told the  agent  that his  \"friend\"  would\r\n     deliver  the   five  kilograms   from  New   York;  the\r\n     automobileinJimenez's drivewayhadaNew Yorkregistration.\r\n\n     5.  The kilogram recovered in November was wrapped in a\r\n     bag from a store from Queens, New York;  the automobile\r\n     in Jimenez's driveway was registered to a man who lived\r\n     in Queens; and the  two kilograms recovered in February\r\n     were wrapped  in bags  containing the  logo of  the New\r\n     York Times -- suggesting that the cocaine  had a common\r\n     origin.\r\n\n     6.   Pen  register information  revealed  that  between\r\n     January 6, 1994  and February  2, 1994,  59 calls  were\r\n     placed from Jimenez's residence to Moreno's.   Nineteen\r\n     of these calls occurred  during January 29 and February\r\n     2, the days leading up to the deal.\r\n\n     7.  Additional quantities  of cocaine were found inside\r\n     Jimenez's home -- suggesting that larger  quantities of\r\n     cocaine had been stored there.\r\n\n     8.   Jimenez  and/or  Moreno had  ample opportunity  to\r\n     discard or remove the three kilograms of cocaine.\r\n\n     The government contends that Mojabi's affidavit was just one\r\n\nof many factors considered  by the court, and  that, even in  its\r\n\nabsence,  there was  sufficient evidence  to support  the court's\r\n\nfinding.     While   we   make  no   determination  whether   the\r\n\ncircumstantial evidence considered alone could have supported the\r\n\ncourt's finding  -- i.e.,  whether it  would survive  clear error\r                                  \r\n\nreview --  we do not consider  the evidence so  substantial as to\r\n\nmake consideration of the affidavit, if erroneous, harmless.  \r\n\n     Three  factors inform  our conclusion.   First,  the court's\r\n\nquestion  to the government during sentencing -- \"Don't I have to\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nrely  on  Mr.  Mojabi's  affidavit  in  order  to  come  to  that\r\n\nconclusion [that Jimenez is  responsible for the five kilograms]\"\r\n\n--  indicates  that  Mojabi's  affidavit  was  the  key piece  of\r\n\nevidence.  Second, the probation department, considering the same\r\n\ncircumstantial evidence, refused to deem Jimenez responsible  for\r\n\nmore  than the  recovered cocaine.   Third, the  evidence, though\r\n\nclearly confirming Jimenez's involvement in the conspiracy, is as\r\n\nconsistent with  Jimenez's participation in only  the first stage\r\n\nof the  transaction as  his awareness  of the  whole transaction.\r\n\nThus, because  the affidavit  appears  to have  been the  crucial\r\n\npiece  of  evidence  in  the district  court's  finding  of  drug\r\n\nquantity, we  must assess whether  it was properly  considered by\r\n\nthe court.\r\n\n     At sentencing,  the \"court may consider relevant information\r\n\nwithout regard to its  admissibility under the rules of  evidence\r\n\napplicable at trial, provided that the information has sufficient\r\n\nindicia  of  reliability  to  support   its  probable  accuracy.\"\r\n\nU.S.S.G.    6A1.3(a); United  States v.

Shrader, 56 F.3d 288, 294 (1st Cir. 1995); Tardiff, 969\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d at 1287.  \r\n\n     In   challenging   the   affidavit's  reliability,   Jimenez\r\n\ncomplains  of 1)  the  lack of  corroboration;  2) Mojabi's  self\r\n\ninterest  to implicate  Jimenez;  and 3)  the improbability  that\r\n\nMojabi could  relate a discussion involving  Jimenez, given that,\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\npurportedly,  Mojabi did  not speak Spanish  and Jimenez  did not\r\n\nspeak English.  We will address each of these in turn.    \r\n\n     Corroboration.  The affidavit, prepared on February 6, 1995,\r                            \r\n\ncontained  information that  was not  contained in  the  PSR, the\r\n\ngovernment's objections to the PSR, witness testimony at Moreno's\r\n\ntrial,  or any  contemporaneous document,  despite the  fact that\r\n\nMojabi  had been  cooperating with  the government  since shortly\r\n\nafter his  arrest in February, 1994.   Nor is the  information in\r\n\nthe affidavit corroborated by  any of the circumstantial evidence\r\n\ndelineated above.  Indeed, the only substantiation the government\r\n\ncan  muster  is that,  on the  day the  meeting described  in the\r\n\naffidavit took place, the agent observed Moreno, Fazio and Mojabi\r\n\narriving together  at the  restaurant,  supporting an  inference,\r\n\nperhaps, that  Moreno,  Fazio and  Mojabi met  together prior  to\r\n\ntheir arrival.  Jimenez, however, was not seen with the others.\r\n\n     Self-Interest.  At sentencing,  Jimenez contended that given\r                            \r\n\nthe plea negotiations between the government and Mojabi, and even\r\n\nindependent  of any  rewards or  inducements relating  to a  plea\r\n\nagreement, Mojabi may have  believed that it was in  his interest\r\n\nto  help the  government convict  Jimenez of  a higher  amount of\r\n\ncocaine.   In response, the  government stated that  there was no\r\n\nwritten,  signed agreement  with Mojabi,  but that  any agreement\r\n\nreached  would  be  breached   by  the  proffering  of  dishonest\r\n\ninformation.   In addition,  the government asserted  that Mojabi\r\n\nwas  seeking a     5K1.1 departure,  which  applies only  if  the\r\n\ndefendant  provides   truthful  assistance.     In  other  words,\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\naccording to the government, Mojabi had an obligation, and  every\r\n\nincentive, to tell the truth.  \r\n\n     Alternatively, the government argued that by placing himself\r\n\nat  the scene of the  negotiations, Mojabi was subjecting himself\r\n\nto  potentially greater  criminal  liability --  demonstrative of\r\n\ncredibility as  a \"statement against interest.\"   Countering this\r\n\nassertion, Jimenez responded that, under U.S.S.G.   1B1.8(a), any\r\n\nself-incriminating information could not be used against Mojabi. \r\n\n     Language Barrier.   Finally,  Jimenez contended  that Mojabi\r                               \r\n\nand Jimenez  do not  share  a common  language, Jimenez  speaking\r\n\nSpanish  and having  only  minimal understanding  of English  and\r\n\nMojabi speaking only English.   As such, Jimenez argued  that the\r\n\naffidavit  was \"ambiguous on its  face.\"  The  government did not\r\n\nrespond  at   sentencing  to  this  point,   which  identifies  a\r\n\ndiscrepancy not easily ignored.  Mojabi did not refer merely to a\r\n\nsimple  remark.    The  affidavit  purports  to  cover  Jimenez's\r\n\ncomments on the following  subjects:  the amount of  kilograms to\r\n\nsell,  his plan to deliver  the cocaine and  receive payment, his\r\n\nprior experience in delivery, his lack  of fear, his lack of need\r\n\nof a gun, his prior  residence in New York, the trust  others had\r\n\nin him and their prior employment of him.\r\n\n     Separately, these types of  complaints are unlikely to carry\r\n\nthe  day.  As we  have previously indicated,  courts may consider\r\n\neven uncorroborated affidavits.   See Shrader, 56 F.3d at  294-95\r                                                       \r\n\n(refusing  to  adopt   a  per  se   rule  of  unreliability   for\r                                           \r\n\nuncorroborated   affidavits   of  cooperating   co-conspirators).\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nMoreover, a  co-defendant's cooperation with the  government does\r\n\nnot  make  his  statements  inherently  suspect.    Finally,  the\r\n\nresolution  of  factual discrepancies  is  especially  within the\r\n\ncourt's domain.\r\n\n     We are nonetheless convinced that in this  case the district\r\n\ncourt  erred   in  relying  on   the  Mojabi  affidavit.     Most\r\n\nsignificantly, Jimenez's  claim, uncontested by the government at\r\n\nsentencing, that he  and Mojabi shared no common  language raised\r\n\nan important doubt about the reliability of the affidavit.  Faced\r\n\nwith  this challenge  to  Mojabi's credibility,  and with  little\r\n\nother probative evidence of Jimenez's involvement with the latter\r\n\ntransaction, the  court should not  have chosen simply  to credit\r\n\nthe affidavit without looking into the matter further.  \r\n\n     We  are also influenced, though  to a lesser  extent, by two\r\n\nother considerations:  1) there was little basis here on which to\r\n\npremise  a credibility  determination  -- the  affiant had  never\r\n\nappeared  before  the court  or grand  jury  nor did  anyone ever\r\n\nattest  to  his  veracity;  and 2)  there  was  no  corroboration\r\n\nwhatsoever of the content of Mojabi's statement.3\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3   The  presence  of these  factors,  whether alone  or  in\r\nconjunction,  has often been significant in  other cases where we\r\nhave rejected challenges to the consideration of hearsay evidence\r\nat sentencing.  See, e.g., United States v. Shrader, 56 F.3d 288,\r                                                             \r\n294-95 (1st  Cir. 1995) (witness  vouched for the  credibility of\r\nco-conspirators); United States v.  Williams, 10 F.3d 910, 914-15\r                                                      \r\n(1st  Cir. 1993)  (hearsay testimony given  in formal  grand jury\r\nproceeding);  United States v. Montoya,  967 F.2d 1,  3 (1st Cir.\r                                                \r\n1992)  (witness  providing  hearsay   testimony  cross-examined);\r\nUnited  States v. Zuleta-Alvarez, 922 F.2d 33, 37 (1st Cir. 1990)\r                                          \r\n(testimony relied upon given  at trial and before the  grand jury\r\nand corroborated by many witnesses).\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\n     Finally, in  light of  these circumstances, we  are somewhat\r\n\nconcerned by the court's failure to articulate any reason why the\r\n\naffidavit was  reliable.   After hearing counsel  debate Mojabi's\r\n\ncredibility, the court announced:\r\n\n     I've  considered  the  arguments  of  counsel  and  the\r\n     submissions  that were  made to  the Court  before oral\r\n     argument.   And  as a  result thereof, the  Court finds\r\n     that  the defendant  . .  . was  aware of  negotiations\r\n     between the other codefendants and the undercover agent\r\n     to sell at least five kilograms of cocaine . . . .\r\n\n     Despite the  clear dispute  over reliability, the  court did\r\n\nnot  mention the affidavit, or any other evidence, at all.  While\r\n\nwe  assume that  the  \"arguments\" and  \"submissions\" referred  to\r\n\nincluded, inter  alia, the Mojabi affidavit,  indicating that the\r                               \r\n\ncourt  found  that  the  affidavit  was  reliable,4  the  court's\r\n\nconclusory pronouncement diminishes our confidence  that it fully\r\n\nconsidered this important issue.\r\n\n     Most likely,  doubts about  the Mojabi affidavit  could have\r\n\nbeen  resolved  by holding  an  evidentiary  hearing, as  Jimenez\r\n\nrequested.5   Such  hearings may  be burdensome,  but  the stakes\r\n\nhere were high:   the affidavit provided the crucial  evidence of\r\n\nthe amount of drugs that  could be attributed to Jimenez, and  as\r\n\nmuch as four years in prison were riding on the issue.  While the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4  The government does not contest that the court considered\r\nthe affidavit.\r\n\n     5   On  January 24, 1995,  Jimenez requested  an evidentiary\r\nhearing.  Though Jimenez  did not formally renew this  request at\r\nhis sentencing  hearing, both parties  address the merits  of the\r\ncourt's  denial  of  his  request.   This  is  appropriate  since\r\nJimenez's  challenge  to  the  reliability of  the  affidavit  is\r\ninexorably  intertwined with  his  claim concerning  the  court's\r\nfailure to hold an evidentiary hearing.\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\ndistrict court has considerable discretion in deciding whether it\r\n\nhas  sufficient  evidence  upon  which   to  make  a  finding  at\r\n\nsentencing, here  the district court's  decision to  rely on  the\r\n\naffidavit without an evidentiary hearing was error.\r\n\n     The government contends that the court adequately dealt with\r\n\nthe  reliability issue by taking  a full proffer  from Jimenez of\r\n\nfacts in  support of his position.  Such an opportunity may often\r\n\nbe sufficient  to allay  reliability concerns.   See Shrader,  56\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.3d at  295.   But  in this  case, Jimenez's  proffer raised  an\r\n\nimportant doubt  about the  reliability of Mojabi's  affidavit --\r\n\nthe language  discrepancy -- that  the government did  not refute\r\n\nand that the court did not  resolve; the affidavit was by far the\r\n\nmost  important evidence on the  issue of drug  quantity, and the\r\n\nstakes for defendant were extremely high.\r\n\n     We  therefore vacate  Jimenez's sentence  and remand  to the\r\n\ndistrict court for resentencing in a  manner consistent with this\r\n\nopinion.     \r\n\n     2.   The Safety Valve Exception\r                                              \r\n\n     In  1994, Congress  enacted 18 U.S.C.    3553(f),  which, in\r\n\ncertain  cases,  limits  the  application  of  mandatory  minimum\r\n\nsentences.    Pursuant  to   this  provision,  when  a  convicted\r\n\ndefendant  meets  five  delineated  requirements,6  the  district\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6  The provision and its guideline counterpart demand that\r\n\n     (1) the defendant  does not have  more than 1  criminal\r\n     history  point,  as  determined  under  the  sentencing\r\n     guidelines;\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\ncourt \"shall\" impose a sentence in accordance with the guidelines\r\n\nwithout  regard to any statutory  minimum sentence.   18 U.S.C.  \r\n\n3553(f);  U.S.S.G.   5C1.2.  The parties agree that Jimenez meets\r\n\nthe  first  four  requirements,  but  dispute  whether  Jimenez's\r\n\ndisclosure to  a  probation officer,  but not  the United  States\r\n\nAttorney, constitutes  providing information to  the \"Government\"\r\n\nas understood under   5C1.2(5).  We review this question of legal\r\n\ninterpretation  under the guidelines  de novo.   United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nGary, 74 F.3d 304, 315 (1st Cir. 1996).\r              \r\n\n     Neither the United States Code nor the Sentencing Guidelines\r\n\ncontains  a specific  definition of  \"government.\"   Jimenez thus\r\n\nadvances a  generic conception derived  from a dictionary:   \"the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     (2)  the defendant  did  not use  violence or  credible\r\n     threats  of  violence or  possess  a  firearm or  other\r\n     dangerous  weapon (or induce  another participant to do\r\n     so) in connection with the offense;\r\n\n     (3)  the  offense did  not result  in death  or serious\r\n     bodily injury to any person;\r\n\n     (4)  the   defendant  was  not  an  organizer,  leader,\r\n     manager,  or supervisor  of others  in the  offense, as\r\n     determined under the sentencing  guidelines and was not\r\n     engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise, as defined\r\n     in 21 U.S.C.   848; and\r\n\n     (5) not later than the time  of the sentencing hearing,\r\n     the defendant has truthfully provided to the Government\r\n     all   information  and   evidence  the   defendant  has\r\n     concerning the  offense or  offenses that were  part of\r\n     the same course  of conduct  or of a  common scheme  or\r\n     plan, but the fact that  the defendant has no  relevant\r\n     or  useful other  information  to provide  or that  the\r\n     Government is already  aware of  the information  shall\r\n     not preclude  a   determination by  the court  that the\r\n     defendant has complied with this requirement.\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   3553(f); U.S.S.G.   5C1.2.\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\nexecutive  branch  of  the  United  States  Federal  Government.\"\r\n\nJimenez asserts that this characterization includes the probation\r\n\ndepartment.  For additional support, Jimenez contends, correctly,\r\n\nthat  aspects  of  the  sentencing  procedures  contemplate  some\r\n\ndisclosure to the probation officer.  See U.S.S.G.   6A1.1.\r                                                   \r\n\n     In resolving  this issue, we  are guided by  the use  of the\r\n\nword   \"government\"  in   other  relevant   provisions,   and  by\r\n\nlegislative history.   Section 5C1.2 provides that \"prior  to its\r\n\ndetermination,  the   court  shall   afford  the   government  an\r\n\nopportunity  to make a recommendation\" and cites Fed. R. Crim. P.\r\n\n32(a)(1).7     Section  5C1.2   comment.  (n.8.).     Under  this\r\n\nprocedural   rule,   \"government\"   implicitly   identifies   the\r\n\nprosecutorial authority.  See United States v. Rodriguez, 60 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n\n193, 196  &amp;  n.3 (5th  Cir. 1995)  (relying on,  inter alia,  the\r                                                                     \r\n\ndoctrine  of  in pari  materia in  holding  that statements  to a\r                                        \r\n\nprobation officer do not satisfy   5C1.2).8\r\n\n     We also  think  that     5C1.2  is  properly  understood  in\r\n\nconjunction with     5K1.1, which  authorizes downward  departure\r\n\nupon  the government's  motion  that the  defendant has  provided\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     7  The  November 1994  Guidelines Manual refers  to Fed.  R.\r\nCrim.  P. 32(a)(1).  Pursuant to a 1994 amendment, Rules 32(c)(1)\r\nand  (3) now address the  sentencing hearing and contain material\r\npreviously located in Rule 32(a)(1).  Reflecting this change, the\r\nNovember 1995 Guidelines Manual cites Rules 32(c)(1) and (3).\r\n\n     8    Jimenez  argues  that  if     5C1.2  only  contemplates\r\ncommunication with the  prosecution, then the language  of note 8\r\nis surplusage.   The  language merely illustrates,  however, that\r\nthe  court  is  not  dependent  on  the  recommendation   of  the\r\nprosecution,  as it is with a   5K1.1 departure, which requires a\r\nmotion from the government.\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\nsubstantial assistance to  authorities.  The  second clause of   \r\n\n5C1.2(5)  -- securing the benefit  of the \"safety  valve\" even if\r\n\nthe fully disclosing defendant  \"has no useful other information\"\r\n\nor  the  \"Government  is  already aware\"  --  seems  specifically\r\n\ndesigned to  reward forthcoming  defendants who cannot  satisfy  \r\n\n5K1.1.   It seems evident  that section 5K1.1's  reference to the\r\n\n\"government\" and  to \"substantial assistance in the investigation\r\n\nor prosecution  of another  person\" contemplates  the defendant's\r\n\nprovision of information useful in criminal prosecutions.\r\n\n     The house  report accompanying the 1994  bill reinforces the\r\n\nnotion that the provision requires disclosure of information of a\r\n\ntype  that would aid prosecutors' investigative  work.  It states\r\n\nthat, \"by the time  of sentencing, the defendant must  have fully\r                                                                           \r\n\nassisted  the Government  by providing  all  relevant information\r                  \r\n\nregarding  the offense.\"  H.R. Rep. No. 460, 103d Cong., 2d Sess.\r\n\n(1994) (emphasis added).   We think  this contemplates more  than\r\n\nthe  summary of the crime typically  provided by a defendant to a\r\n\nprobation officer.   Our conclusion is further  buttressed by the\r\n\ntiming component  of    5C1.2(5)  -- requiring  provision of  all\r\n\ninformation to the  Government \"not  later than the  time of  the\r\n\nsentencing    hearing\"    --   which    necessarily   anticipates\r\n\ncommunication  that  could  occur   after  the  creation  of  the\r\n\npresentence report, indicating that something other than ordinary\r\n\ndisclosure to a probation officer is intended.\r\n\n     While full  disclosure to  the probation officer  may assist\r\n\nthe officer  in preparing the defendant's  presentence report, we\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\ndo  not believe that    5C1.2 was  meant to  extend so far.   The\r\n\nprobation officer  does not create  a presentence report  with an\r\n\neye to  future prosecutions or  investigations.  Indeed,  in that\r\n\ncontext,   the  disclosure  of  one's   role  is  the  domain  of\r\n\n\"acceptance  of  responsibility.\"    Section  5C1.2,  like 5K1.1,\r\n\nrequires  more  affirmative   involvement  in  the  prosecutorial\r\n\nfunction.

Sentencing Issues:  Moreno\r                                        \r\n\n     1.  Quantity of Drugs\r                                    \r\n\n     At  the   time  of  Moreno's   sentencing,  the   sentencing\r\n\nguidelines provided:\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     9   We can conceive of circumstances where the objectives of\r\nthe provision would arguably be met even though the defendant did\r\nnot communicate  directly with the government.   For example, the\r\ndefendant  might advise  a  probation officer  of  his intent  to\r\nreveal all relevant details as required by the provision and then\r\ndisclose  this information,  which in  turn is  passed on  to the\r\ngovernment.     We   need   not  decide   whether  such   unusual\r\ncircumstances would satisfy   5C1.2(5) because this is not such a\r\ncase.\r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\n     In  an offense  involving negotiation  to traffic  in a\r\n     controlled substance,  the weight under  negotiation in\r\n     an uncompleted distribution shall  be used to calculate\r\n     the applicable amount.   However, where the court finds\r\n     that the  defendant did not  intend to produce  and was\r\n     not  reasonably  capable  of  producing  the negotiated\r\n     amount, the  court  shall exclude  from  the  guideline\r\n     calculation the  amount it finds the  defendant did not\r\n     intend  to produce  and was  not reasonably  capable of\r\n     producing.\r\n\nU.S.S.G.   2D1.1 comment. (n.12).10\r\n\n     The  court found that Moreno \"intended to  produce . . . and\r\n\nwas reasonably capable  of producing for sale such five kilograms\r\n\nof cocaine.\"   It added, \"part  of the evidence supporting  . . .\r\n\ncapability .  . . is the two kilograms that  were seized . . . on\r\n\nFebruary  2,  1994.\"   As  a  result,  the  court attributed  six\r\n\nkilograms of cocaine to Moreno -- the five negotiated and the one\r\n\ndelivered in November -- a quantity carrying a base offense level\r\n\nof 32.         Moreno  concedes  his   intent  to  produce   five\r\n\nkilograms  of cocaine,  but contends  that there  is insufficient\r\n\nevidence that  he was capable  of producing  the three  kilograms\r\n\nthat would  have  consummated  the deal.    We  review  factbound\r\n\nmatters in sentencing for clear error, mindful  that such factual\r\n\nfindings  need only  be  supported  by  a  preponderance  of  the\r\n\nevidence.  United States v. Martinez-Martinez, 69 F.3d 1215, 1224\r                                                       \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1995). \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     10   The  Sentencing Commission  amended note  12, effective\r\nNovember, 1995, by, inter  alia, replacing the \"and\" in  the last\r                                         \r\nsentence with \"or.\"   See 1995 Guidelines Manual, App.  C, Amend.\r                                   \r\n518.  Nonetheless, we  consider Moreno's claim in the  context of\r\nthe  guidelines in  effect  in  April,  1995,  the  time  of  his\r\nsentencing.  See U.S.S.G.   1B1.11(a).\r                          \r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\n     Despite Moreno's  efforts to distance himself  from the two-\r\n\nkilogram  seizure,  it  is   a  reasonable  conclusion  that  the\r\n\nrecovered  cocaine  constituted  the  first stage  of  the  five-\r\n\nkilogram deal.   In turn,  it is entirely  plausible to  conclude\r\n\nthat Moreno, having the  capability to produce the first  part of\r\n\nthe deal, had the capability to consummate the deal, particularly\r\n\nwhen the two stages were to take place in close  succession.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited  States v.  Legarda,  17 F.3d  496,  501 (1st  Cir.  1994)\r                                    \r\n\n(\"entirely  plausible  . .  .  that  defendant, having  delivered\r\n\neleven kilograms  of cocaine one week, was  capable of delivering\r\n\nten kilograms the following week\").  At the very least, we do not\r\n\ndiscern clear error. \r\n\n     The government  also argues, in the  alternative, that under\r\n\nour recent precedent, Moreno's concession of intent is sufficient\r\n\nalone to render him  liable for the whole negotiated  amount.  We\r\n\nagree.  In United States v. Pion, 25 F.3d 18, 25 (1st Cir. 1994),\r                                          \r\n\nwe  concluded that the  conjunctive phrasing of  note 12 requires\r\n\nthe sentencing court to include  the weight negotiated unless the\r\n\ndefendant establishes both lack of intent and incapability.  In a\r\n\nsubsequent case, we stated \"if the court finds by a preponderance\r\n\nof the  evidence in regard  to an  aborted narcotics  transaction\r\n\nthat  the  defendant had  either the  intent  or the  capacity to\r\n\ndeliver the full amount of the drugs under negotiation, then that\r\n\namount must be included in the drug quantity calculation,\" United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates  v.

Obstruction of Justice\r                                          \r\n\n     Enhancement  for  obstruction of  justice  can  be based  on\r\n\nconduct  \"threatening,  intimidating,  or   otherwise  unlawfully\r\n\ninfluencing  a  co-defendant,  witness,  or  juror,  directly  or\r\n\nindirectly, or attempting to  do so.\"  U.S.S.G.    3C1.1 comment.\r\n\n(n.3(a)).   The court found that Moreno \"attempted to influence a\r\n\nwitness in this case by actions of his own and through actions of\r\n\nhis  common  law wife\"  and increased  his  offense level  by two\r\n\nlevels.   We review  the court's  determination for  clear error.\r\n\nSee United States v. Gonzales, 12 F.3d 298, 299 (1st Cir. 1993).\r                                       \r\n\n     The  PSR   reported  that  Moreno,  from   prison,  and  his\r\n\ngirlfriend contacted Fazio several times  in an effort to  induce\r\n\nhim  to testify  that  Moreno  had  a  subordinate  role  in  the\r\n\nconspiracy.   Moreno, in  his objections  to the  PSR and  at his\r\n\nsentencing  hearing, did not deny  that he or  his girlfriend had\r\n\ncontacted Fazio  but contended that he was trying to \"urge him to\r\n\ntell the truth.\"  In contrast, Fazio's testimony during  Moreno's\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     11   Moreno  cites the  following language  from an  earlier\r\ncase:  \"Our case law has followed the language of this Commentary\r\nNote  in a rather faithful  fashion, requiring a  showing of both\r\nintent and ability to  deliver in order to allow the inclusion of\r\nnegotiated amounts to  be delivered  at a future  time.\"   United\r                                                                           \r\nStates v. Legarda, 17 F.3d 496, 500 (1st Cir. 1994).   While this\r                           \r\nlanguage supports Moreno's position, we are bound by the on point\r\nholdings  of Pion and Muniz.   See United  States v. Graciani, 61\r                                                                       \r\nF.3d 70, 75 (1st Cir. 1995).\r\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\ntrial   indicates   that   Moreno   attempted   to   script   his\r\n\ntestimony.12\r\n\n     Credibility determinations at sentencing are the province of\r\n\nthe  court, and  are scrutinized  only for  clear error.   United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.  Webster, 54 F.3d 1,  5 (1st Cir. 1995).   Here, Moreno\r                            \r\n\nconcedes that the  communication took  place.  He  admits to  the\r\n\nbasic content of the communication:  asking Fazio to testify that\r\n\nhis [Moreno's]  role in  the conspiracy consisted  of acting  the\r\n\npart  of a drug dealer.   Moreno's only  offered justification is\r\n\nthat he  was encouraging Fazio to  tell the truth.   In our view,\r\n\nafter  presiding  over  Moreno's  trial,  and   having  extensive\r\n\nopportunity to observe Fazio and Moreno, the court's rejection of\r\n\nMoreno's version of events easily survives clear error review.\r\n\n     Moreno  argues, further,  that  the court  made no  specific\r\n\nfindings of the  \"words used,  the speaker's meaning,  or what  a\r\n\nlistener's reasonable  interpretation would be.\"   At sentencing,\r\n\nthe judge  is required to  \"state in open  court the  reasons for\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     12  The  following exchange  took place during  a voir  dire\r\nhearing relating to another matter:\r\n     Q.  [by government]  What  was the  phone call  conversation\r\nabout?\r\n     A. [by Fazio] What Moreno was telling me.\r\n     Q. What was he telling you?\r\n     A. Well, he was  telling me to not testify against  him, not\r\nto   drown him and to try to save him.\r\n     Q. How did he want you to try to save him.\r\n     A. By not testifying against him.\r\n     Q. Did he tell you anything he wanted you to say?\r\n     A. Yes, he did.\r\n     Q. What was that?\r\n     A. To say that  I was the big man  and he was just  a friend\r\n     trying to help me out trying to find somebody.\r\n\n                               -23-\r\r\n\n[the]  imposition of  the  particular  sentence.\"   18  U.S.C.   \r\n\n3553(c).    Here,  the  court  stated  its  finding  that  Moreno\r\n\nattempted to influence a witness, a clear example  of obstruction\r\n\nof  justice.  See U.S.S.G.   3C1.1 comment. (n.3(a)).  The narrow\r                           \r\n\nscope of the issue in dispute,  the specific findings in the PSR,\r\n\nwhich  were adopted  by the  district judge  as evidenced  by the\r\n\njudgment  form,   and  the  extensive  discussion  at  sentencing\r\n\nsufficiently enable effective appellate  review.  This was enough\r\n\nto satisfy   3553(c).  See  United States v. Catano, 65 F.3d 219,\r                                                             \r\n\n230 (1st Cir.  1995); United States v.

Evidentiary Hearing\r                                       \r\n\n     Moreno's final challenge is to the court's refusal to compel\r\n\nJimenez  and Uroujo  to  appear as  witnesses  at his  sentencing\r\n\nhearing.   We review the court's denial of an evidentiary hearing\r\n\nfor  abuse of discretion.  United  States v. Garcia, 954 F.2d 12,\r                                                             \r\n\n19 (1st Cir. 1992).  \r\n\n     At trial, the judge observed the government's case-in-chief,\r\n\nincluding  recordings  and videotapes  of  Moreno discussing  the\r\n\nfive-kilogram  deal with Fazio and the  undercover agent.  Moreno\r\n\nhad  an opportunity  to cross-examine  Fazio and  the  agent, and\r\n\nsucceeded in  introducing  Fazio's possible  bias.   And, at  his\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     13   Moreno argues that the court  should have made specific\r\nfindings  in accordance with United States  v. Dunnigan, 507 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n87  (1993).   Since the  obstruction of  justice finding  was not\r\npremised on perjury, Dunnigan does not govern.\r                                       \r\n\n                               -24-\r\r\n\nsentencing hearing,  Moreno testified  extensively in  support of\r\n\nhis version of events.   In sum, Moreno had a more  than adequate\r\n\nopportunity to  present information  on any factor  reasonably in\r\n\ndispute.   See  U.S.S.G.    6A1.3(a).    Further  testimony  from\r                        \r\n\nJimenez and Uroujo would have served no purpose.  Accordingly, we\r\n\nsee  no error in the court's  refusal to issue subpoenas to these\r\n\nwitnesses.\r\n\n     The sentence of Jimenez is vacated, and the case is remanded\r                                                                           \r\n\nfor  further   proceedings  consistent  with  this   opinion  and\r                                                                           \r\n\nresentencing.

Jimenez also contests the court's determination that his disclosure to a probation officer did not satisfy the requirements of the \"safety valve\" provision contained in U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2, which permits a judge to impose a sentence below the statutory minimum.   Finally, Moreno asserts that the evidence was insufficient to warrant a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice.

In an attempt to secure a source for the cocaine, Fazio contacted Moreno, who responded that he \"would come through with the deal.\"   A meeting ensued between Moreno, Fazio and the agent, where in contemplation of the five-kilogram deal, the parties agreed to a preliminary one-kilogram purchase to take place on November 10, 1993.   On November 9, Moreno introduced Fazio to Jimenez, the \"man who worked for him, that delivers coke for him, and ... [who] was the transporter.\"   On November 10, Jimenez, accompanied by Fazio, delivered one kilogram of cocaine to the agent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 30, further negotiations between Fazio, Moreno and the agent took place.   Moreno proposed splitting the five-kilogram transaction into two separate sales.   After two more meetings, the five-kilogram deal, to be broken up into two separate transactions, was scheduled for February 2, 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the morning of February 2, Moreno spotted surveillance agents outside his home, and cancelled the deal.   Upon hearing of the cancellation, the agents left their positions outside Moreno's and Jimenez's homes, but returned a short time later.   At that time, Jimenez was observed entering his home, followed shortly thereafter by co-conspirator Gabriel Uroujo Perez, who was carrying an empty shoulder bag.   Uroujo exited with a full shoulder bag, later found to contain just over 2 kilograms of cocaine.   A search of Jimenez's home uncovered an additional 123.8 grams of cocaine.   The three kilograms that would have completed the transaction were never found.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jimenez pled guilty to conspiracy to distribute cocaine, distribution of cocaine, and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.

The government objected, contending that Jimenez should be liable for the whole five kilograms negotiated.   On January 24, 1995, in response to the government's objections, Jimenez requested an evidentiary hearing and order to the Government \"to present any witnesses it intends to use in support of its objections.\"   This motion was denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jimenez's sentencing hearing took place on April 3, 1995.   In support of its position, the government relied on circumstantial evidence and one piece of direct evidence, an affidavit from co-defendant Ramin Mojabi, prepared on February 6, 1995, which stated that Jimenez was present during a December 30, 1993 meeting with Moreno and Fazio, and took part in discussions concerning the five-kilogram deal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding Jimenez's challenges to the affidavit's reliability, the court found that Jimenez was aware of the object of the conspiracy, the five-kilogram deal, and was, therefore, responsible for the whole five kilograms.   In addition, the court denied Jimenez the benefit of U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2, which permits a court to impose punishment without regard to the statutory minimum sentence.   While Jimenez had provided information to the probation department, he did not apprise the United States Attorney's Office, and the court, therefore, found that he had not informed the \"Government\" as required by &#167; 5C1.2(5).   Consequently, Jimenez was subject to the 10 year minimum sentence--not the applicable guideline range of 70-87 months--and was sentenced accordingly to 120 months incarceration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Sentencing:  Moreno</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreno's sentencing hearings took place on March 23 and April 6, 1995.   On March 13, the court denied Moreno's motions for an evidentiary hearing and for issuance of subpoenas to co-conspirators Jimenez and Uroujo to appear as witnesses at his sentencing.   At the first hearing, Moreno testified that his role in the conspiracy was limited to playacting the role of a drug dealer in order to assist Fazio.   He further contended that because he did not have the capability to produce the additional three kilograms of cocaine on February 2, he could not be held responsible for the total negotiated amount of five kilograms.   The court rejected these arguments, finding Moreno responsible for over five kilograms, and increasing his offense level by two in accordance with his role as a manager and supervisor in the conspiracy.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court further found that Moreno had phoned Fazio, and Moreno's wife had visited Fazio, in an effort to influence Fazio's testimony at Moreno's trial.   Accordingly, the court enhanced Moreno's offense level another two levels for obstruction of justice.   Moreno was sentenced to 188 months incarceration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. Sentencing Issues:  Jimenez</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Quantity of Drugs</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have often recognized, sentencing calculations for drug trafficking offenses are largely quantity-driven.   See United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1196 (1st Cir.1993).   In the conspiracy context, a defendant is accountable for \"all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.\"  United States v. Ovalle-Marquez, 36 F.3d 212, 223 (1st Cir.1994) (quoting U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3(a)(1)(B)).   See also Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1197;  United States v. O'Campo, 973 F.2d 1015, 1026 (1st Cir.1992) (\"[T]he base offense level of a co-conspirator at sentencing should reflect only the quantity of drugs he reasonably foresees it is the object of the conspiracy to distribute after he joins the conspiracy.\").   We review quantity determinations for clear error.   See United States v. St. Cyr, 977 F.2d 698, 701 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jimenez admits agreeing to store two kilograms of cocaine, but denies having any knowledge whatsoever of the secondary three kilogram transaction.   He advances three related arguments against the court's decision holding him accountable for the whole five kilograms negotiated.   First, he claims that the Mojabi affidavit was unreliable and should not have been considered by the court.   Second, he argues that, at the very least, the court should have staged an evidentiary hearing.   Finally, he contends that, without the affidavit, the court's determination was clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Mojabi Affidavit</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Mojabi affidavit was the only piece of direct evidence linking Jimenez to the five-kilogram deal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  In order to place the affidavit in context, we first provide in detail the circumstantial evidence before the court that, according to the government, demonstrated Jimenez's awareness of the deal:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>1. Jimenez was introduced to Fazio as the person who worked for, and transported cocaine for, Moreno.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>2. Moreno told the undercover agent that he intended to use Jimenez in connection with the five-kilogram sale, and Jimenez stored the first installment of two kilograms in his home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>3. Moreno told the agent that Jimenez had modified an automobile to transport up to ten kilograms;  such an automobile was parked in Jimenez's driveway on February 2, 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>4. Moreno told the agent that his \"friend\" would deliver the five kilograms from New York;  the automobile in Jimenez's driveway had a New York registration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>5. The kilogram recovered in November was wrapped in a bag from a store from Queens, New York;  the automobile in Jimenez's driveway was registered to a man who lived in Queens;  and the two kilograms recovered in February were wrapped in bags containing the logo of the New York Times--suggesting that the cocaine had a common origin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>6. Pen register information revealed that between January 6, 1994 and February 2, 1994, 59 calls were placed from Jimenez's residence to Moreno's.   Nineteen of these calls occurred during January 29 and February 2, the days leading up to the deal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>7. Additional quantities of cocaine were found inside Jimenez's home--suggesting that larger quantities of cocaine had been stored there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>8. Jimenez and/or Moreno had ample opportunity to discard or remove the three kilograms of cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contends that Mojabi's affidavit was just one of many factors considered by the court, and that, even in its absence, there was sufficient evidence to support the court's finding.   While we make no determination whether the circumstantial evidence considered alone could have supported the court's finding--i.e., whether it would survive clear error review--we do not consider the evidence so substantial as to make consideration of the affidavit, if erroneous, harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three factors inform our conclusion.   First, the court's question to the government during sentencing--\"Don't I have to rely on Mr. Mojabi's affidavit in order to come to that conclusion [that Jimenez is responsible for the five kilograms]\"--indicates that Mojabi's affidavit was the key piece of evidence.   Second, the probation department, considering the same circumstantial evidence, refused to deem Jimenez responsible for more than the recovered cocaine.   Third, the evidence, though clearly confirming Jimenez's involvement in the conspiracy, is as consistent with Jimenez's participation in only the first stage of the transaction as his awareness of the whole transaction.   Thus, because the affidavit appears to have been the crucial piece of evidence in the district court's finding of drug quantity, we must assess whether it was properly considered by the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the \"court may consider relevant information without regard to its admissibility under the rules of evidence applicable at trial, provided that the information has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 6A1.3(a);  United States v. Tardiff, 969 F.2d 1283, 1287 (1st Cir.1992).   The court has wide discretion in determining whether sentencing information is reliable.  United States v. Shrader, 56 F.3d 288, 294 (1st Cir.1995);  Tardiff, 969 F.2d at 1287.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In challenging the affidavit's reliability, Jimenez complains of 1) the lack of corroboration;  2) Mojabi's self interest to implicate Jimenez;  and 3) the improbability that Mojabi could relate a discussion involving Jimenez, given that, purportedly, Mojabi did not speak Spanish and Jimenez did not speak English.   We will address each of these in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Corroboration.  The affidavit, prepared on February 6, 1995, contained information that was not contained in the PSR, the government's objections to the PSR, witness testimony at Moreno's trial, or any contemporaneous document, despite the fact that Mojabi had been cooperating with the government since shortly after his arrest in February, 1994.   Nor is the information in the affidavit corroborated by any of the circumstantial evidence delineated above.   Indeed, the only substantiation the government can muster is that, on the day the meeting described in the affidavit took place, the agent observed Moreno, Fazio and Mojabi arriving together at the restaurant, supporting an inference, perhaps, that Moreno, Fazio and Mojabi met together prior to their arrival.   Jimenez, however, was not seen with the others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Self-Interest.   At sentencing, Jimenez contended that given the plea negotiations between the government and Mojabi, and even independent of any rewards or inducements relating to a plea agreement, Mojabi may have believed that it was in his interest to help the government convict Jimenez of a higher amount of cocaine.   In response, the government stated that there was no written, signed agreement with Mojabi, but that any agreement reached would be breached by the proffering of dishonest information.   In addition, the government asserted that Mojabi was seeking a &#167; 5K1.1 departure, which applies only if the defendant provides truthful assistance.   In other words, according to the government, Mojabi had an obligation, and every incentive, to tell the truth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, the government argued that by placing himself at the scene of the negotiations, Mojabi was subjecting himself to potentially greater criminal liability--demonstrative of credibility as a \"statement against interest.\"   Countering this assertion, Jimenez responded that, under U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.8(a), any self-incriminating information could not be used against Mojabi.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Language Barrier.   Finally, Jimenez contended that Mojabi and Jimenez do not share a common language, Jimenez speaking Spanish and having only minimal understanding of English and Mojabi speaking only English.   As such, Jimenez argued that the affidavit was \"ambiguous on its face.\"   The government did not respond at sentencing to this point, which identifies a discrepancy not easily ignored.   Mojabi did not refer merely to a simple remark.   The affidavit purports to cover Jimenez's comments on the following subjects:  the amount of kilograms to sell, his plan to deliver the cocaine and receive payment, his prior experience in delivery, his lack of fear, his lack of need of a gun, his prior residence in New York, the trust others had in him and their prior employment of him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Separately, these types of complaints are unlikely to carry the day.   As we have previously indicated, courts may consider even uncorroborated affidavits.   See Shrader, 56 F.3d at 294-95 (refusing to adopt a per se rule of unreliability for uncorroborated affidavits of cooperating co-conspirators).   Moreover, a co-defendant's cooperation with the government does not make his statements inherently suspect.   Finally, the resolution of factual discrepancies is especially within the court's domain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are nonetheless convinced that in this case the district court erred in relying on the Mojabi affidavit.   Most significantly, Jimenez's claim, uncontested by the government at sentencing, that he and Mojabi shared no common language raised an important doubt about the reliability of the affidavit.   Faced with this challenge to Mojabi's credibility, and with little other probative evidence of Jimenez's involvement with the latter transaction, the court should not have chosen simply to credit the affidavit without looking into the matter further.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are also influenced, though to a lesser extent, by two other considerations:  1) there was little basis here on which to premise a credibility determination--the affiant had never appeared before the court or grand jury nor did anyone ever attest to his veracity;  and 2) there was no corroboration whatsoever of the content of Mojabi's statement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, in light of these circumstances, we are somewhat concerned by the court's failure to articulate any reason why the affidavit was reliable.   After hearing counsel debate Mojabi's credibility, the court announced:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>I've considered the arguments of counsel and the submissions that were made to the Court before oral argument.   And as a result thereof, the Court finds that the defendant ... was aware of negotiations between the other codefendants and the undercover agent to sell at least five kilograms of cocaine....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the clear dispute over reliability, the court did not mention the affidavit, or any other evidence, at all.   While we assume that the \"arguments\" and \"submissions\" referred to included, inter alia, the Mojabi affidavit, indicating that the court found that the affidavit was reliable,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> the court's conclusory pronouncement diminishes our confidence that it fully considered this important issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most likely, doubts about the Mojabi affidavit could have been resolved by holding an evidentiary hearing, as Jimenez requested.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Such hearings may be burdensome, but the stakes here were high:  the affidavit provided the crucial evidence of the amount of drugs that could be attributed to Jimenez, and as much as four years in prison were riding on the issue.   While the district court has considerable discretion in deciding whether it has sufficient evidence upon which to make a finding at sentencing, here the district court's decision to rely on the affidavit without an evidentiary hearing was error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contends that the court adequately dealt with the reliability issue by taking a full proffer from Jimenez of facts in support of his position.   Such an opportunity may often be sufficient to allay reliability concerns.   See Shrader, 56 F.3d at 295.   But in this case, Jimenez's proffer raised an important doubt about the reliability of Mojabi's affidavit--the language discrepancy--that the government did not refute and that the court did not resolve;  the affidavit was by far the most important evidence on the issue of drug quantity, and the stakes for defendant were extremely high.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore vacate Jimenez's sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing in a manner consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The Safety Valve Exception</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1994, Congress enacted 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f), which, in certain cases, limits the application of mandatory minimum sentences.   Pursuant to this provision, when a convicted defendant meets five delineated requirements,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> the district court \"shall\" impose a sentence in accordance with the guidelines without regard to any statutory minimum sentence.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f);  U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2.   The parties agree that Jimenez meets the first four requirements, but dispute whether Jimenez's disclosure to a probation officer, but not the United States Attorney, constitutes providing information to the \"Government\" as understood under &#167; 5C1.2(5).   We review this question of legal interpretation under the guidelines de novo.  United States v. Gary, 74 F.3d 304, 315 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither the United States Code nor the Sentencing Guidelines contains a specific definition of \"government.\"   Jimenez thus advances a generic conception derived from a dictionary:  \"the executive branch of the United States Federal Government.\"   Jimenez asserts that this characterization includes the probation department.   For additional support, Jimenez contends, correctly, that aspects of the sentencing procedures contemplate some disclosure to the probation officer.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 6A1.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In resolving this issue, we are guided by the use of the word \"government\" in other relevant provisions, and by legislative history.   Section 5C1.2 provides that \"prior to its determination, the court shall afford the government an opportunity to make a recommendation\" and cites Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(a)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Section 5C1.2 comment.  (n.8.).   Under this procedural rule, \"government\" implicitly identifies the prosecutorial authority.   See United States v. Rodriguez, 60 F.3d 193, 196 &amp; n. 3 (5th Cir.1995) (relying on, inter alia, the doctrine of in pari materia in holding that statements to a probation officer do not satisfy &#167; 5C1.2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also think that &#167; 5C1.2 is properly understood in conjunction with &#167; 5K1.1, which authorizes downward departure upon the government's motion that the defendant has provided substantial assistance to authorities.   The second clause of &#167; 5C1.2(5)--securing the benefit of the \"safety valve\" even if the fully disclosing defendant \"has no useful other information\" or the \"Government is already aware\"--seems specifically designed to reward forthcoming defendants who cannot satisfy &#167; 5K1.1.   It seems evident that section 5K1.1's reference to the \"government\" and to \"substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person\" contemplates the defendant's provision of information useful in criminal prosecutions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The house report accompanying the 1994 bill reinforces the notion that the provision requires disclosure of information of a type that would aid prosecutors' investigative work.   It states that, \"by the time of sentencing, the defendant must have fully assisted the Government by providing all relevant information regarding the offense.\"   H.R.Rep. No. 460, 103d Cong., 2d Sess.  (1994) (emphasis added).   We think this contemplates more than the summary of the crime typically provided by a defendant to a probation officer.   Our conclusion is further buttressed by the timing component of &#167; 5C1.2(5)--requiring provision of all information to the Government \"not later than the time of the sentencing hearing\"--which necessarily anticipates communication that could occur after the creation of the presentence report, indicating that something other than ordinary disclosure to a probation officer is intended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While full disclosure to the probation officer may assist the officer in preparing the defendant's presentence report, we do not believe that &#167; 5C1.2 was meant to extend so far.   The probation officer does not create a presentence report with an eye to future prosecutions or investigations.   Indeed, in that context, the disclosure of one's role is the domain of \"acceptance of responsibility.\"   Section 5C1.2, like 5K1.1, requires more affirmative involvement in the prosecutorial function.   Cf. United States v. Wrenn, 66 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1995) (requiring an affirmative act of cooperation).   See also United States v. Ivester, 75 F.3d 182, 185 (4th Cir.1996);  United States v. Acosta-Olivas, 71 F.3d 375, 378 (10th Cir.1995) (stating that the defendant must disclose \"everything he knows about his own actions and those of his co-conspirators.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we conclude that \"government\" in &#167; 5C1.2(5) refers to the prosecutorial authority.   Accordingly, we affirm the district court's holding that Jimenez did not satisfy the requirements of the \"safety valve\" provision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Sentencing Issues:  Moreno</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Quantity of Drugs</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of Moreno's sentencing, the sentencing guidelines provided:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p>In an offense involving negotiation to traffic in a controlled substance, the weight under negotiation in an uncompleted distribution shall be used to calculate the applicable amount.   However, where the court finds that the defendant did not intend to produce and was not reasonably capable of producing the negotiated amount, the court shall exclude from the guideline calculation the amount it finds the defendant did not intend to produce and was not reasonably capable of producing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1 comment.  (n. 12).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court found that Moreno \"intended to produce ... and was reasonably capable of producing for sale such five kilograms of cocaine.\"   It added, \"part of the evidence supporting ... capability ... is the two kilograms that were seized ... on February 2, 1994.\"   As a result, the court attributed six kilograms of cocaine to Moreno--the five negotiated and the one delivered in November--a quantity carrying a base offense level of 32.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreno concedes his intent to produce five kilograms of cocaine, but contends that there is insufficient evidence that he was capable of producing the three kilograms that would have consummated the deal.   We review factbound matters in sentencing for clear error, mindful that such factual findings need only be supported by a preponderance of the evidence.  United States v. Martinez-Martinez, 69 F.3d 1215, 1224 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite Moreno's efforts to distance himself from the two-kilogram seizure, it is a reasonable conclusion that the recovered cocaine constituted the first stage of the five-kilogram deal.   In turn, it is entirely plausible to conclude that Moreno, having the capability to produce the first part of the deal, had the capability to consummate the deal, particularly when the two stages were to take place in close succession.   See United States v. Legarda, 17 F.3d 496, 501 (1st Cir.1994) (\"entirely plausible ... that defendant, having delivered eleven kilograms of cocaine one week, was capable of delivering ten kilograms the following week\").   At the very least, we do not discern clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government also argues, in the alternative, that under our recent precedent, Moreno's concession of intent is sufficient alone to render him liable for the whole negotiated amount.   We agree.   In United States v. Pion, 25 F.3d 18, 25 (1st Cir.1994), we concluded that the conjunctive phrasing of note 12 requires the sentencing court to include the weight negotiated unless the defendant establishes both lack of intent and incapability.   In a subsequent case, we stated \"if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence in regard to an aborted narcotics transaction that the defendant had either the intent or the capacity to deliver the full amount of the drugs under negotiation, then that amount must be included in the drug quantity calculation,\" United States v. Muniz, 49 F.3d 36, 39 (1st Cir.1995).   Very clearly, then, Moreno's concession of intent also disposes of this issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Obstruction of Justice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Enhancement for obstruction of justice can be based on conduct \"threatening, intimidating, or otherwise unlawfully influencing a co-defendant, witness, or juror, directly or indirectly, or attempting to do so.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1 comment.  (n. 3(a)).   The court found that Moreno \"attempted to influence a witness in this case by actions of his own and through actions of his common law wife\" and increased his offense level by two levels.   We review the court's determination for clear error.   See United States v. Gonzales, 12 F.3d 298, 299 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PSR reported that Moreno, from prison, and his girlfriend contacted Fazio several times in an effort to induce him to testify that Moreno had a subordinate role in the conspiracy.   Moreno, in his objections to the PSR and at his sentencing hearing, did not deny that he or his girlfriend had contacted Fazio but contended that he was trying to \"urge him to tell the truth.\"   In contrast, Fazio's testimony during Moreno's trial indicates that Moreno attempted to script his testimony.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Credibility determinations at sentencing are the province of the court, and are scrutinized only for clear error.  United States v. Webster, 54 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1995).   Here, Moreno concedes that the communication took place.   He admits to the basic content of the communication:  asking Fazio to testify that his [Moreno's] role in the conspiracy consisted of acting the part of a drug dealer.   Moreno's only offered justification is that he was encouraging Fazio to tell the truth.   In our view, after presiding over Moreno's trial, and having extensive opportunity to observe Fazio and Moreno, the court's rejection of Moreno's version of events easily survives clear error review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreno argues, further, that the court made no specific findings of the \"words used, the speaker's meaning, or what a listener's reasonable interpretation would be.\"   At sentencing, the judge is required to \"state in open court the reasons for [the] imposition of the particular sentence.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(c).   Here, the court stated its finding that Moreno attempted to influence a witness, a clear example of obstruction of justice.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1 comment.  (n. 3(a)).   The narrow scope of the issue in dispute, the specific findings in the PSR, which were adopted by the district judge as evidenced by the judgment form, and the extensive discussion at sentencing sufficiently enable effective appellate review.   This was enough to satisfy &#167; 3553(c).   See United States v. Catano, 65 F.3d 219, 230 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v. Schultz, 970 F.2d 960, 963 &amp; n. 7 (1st Cir.1992);  United States v.

We review the court's denial of an evidentiary hearing for abuse of discretion.  United States v.

Moreno had an opportunity to cross-examine Fazio and the agent, and succeeded in introducing Fazio's possible bias.   And, at his sentencing hearing, Moreno testified extensively in support of his version of events.   In sum, Moreno had a more than adequate opportunity to present information on any factor reasonably in dispute.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 6A1.3(a).   Further testimony from Jimenez and Uroujo would have served no purpose.

Jimenez also contests the court's determination that his disclosure to a probation officer did not satisfy the requirements of the \"safety valve\" provision contained in U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2, which permits a judge to impose a sentence below the statutory minimum.   Finally, Moreno asserts that the evidence was insufficient to warrant a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice.

In an attempt to secure a source for the cocaine, Fazio contacted Moreno, who responded that he \"would come through with the deal.\"   A meeting ensued between Moreno, Fazio and the agent, where in contemplation of the five-kilogram deal, the parties agreed to a preliminary one-kilogram purchase to take place on November 10, 1993.   On November 9, Moreno introduced Fazio to Jimenez, the \"man who worked for him, that delivers coke for him, and ... [who] was the transporter.\"   On November 10, Jimenez, accompanied by Fazio, delivered one kilogram of cocaine to the agent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 30, further negotiations between Fazio, Moreno and the agent took place.   Moreno proposed splitting the five-kilogram transaction into two separate sales.   After two more meetings, the five-kilogram deal, to be broken up into two separate transactions, was scheduled for February 2, 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the morning of February 2, Moreno spotted surveillance agents outside his home, and cancelled the deal.   Upon hearing of the cancellation, the agents left their positions outside Moreno's and Jimenez's homes, but returned a short time later.   At that time, Jimenez was observed entering his home, followed shortly thereafter by co-conspirator Gabriel Uroujo Perez, who was carrying an empty shoulder bag.   Uroujo exited with a full shoulder bag, later found to contain just over 2 kilograms of cocaine.   A search of Jimenez's home uncovered an additional 123.8 grams of cocaine.   The three kilograms that would have completed the transaction were never found.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jimenez pled guilty to conspiracy to distribute cocaine, distribution of cocaine, and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.   Moreno went to trial, but, after the government rested its case, pled guilty to conspiracy to distribute cocaine, and distribution of cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Sentencing:  Jimenez</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The probation department determined that Jimenez was accountable for 3.2615 kilograms of cocaine--the one kilogram sold on November 10, 1993 and the cocaine recovered on February 2, 1994.   The government objected, contending that Jimenez should be liable for the whole five kilograms negotiated.   On January 24, 1995, in response to the government's objections, Jimenez requested an evidentiary hearing and order to the Government \"to present any witnesses it intends to use in support of its objections.\"   This motion was denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jimenez's sentencing hearing took place on April 3, 1995.   In support of its position, the government relied on circumstantial evidence and one piece of direct evidence, an affidavit from co-defendant Ramin Mojabi, prepared on February 6, 1995, which stated that Jimenez was present during a December 30, 1993 meeting with Moreno and Fazio, and took part in discussions concerning the five-kilogram deal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding Jimenez's challenges to the affidavit's reliability, the court found that Jimenez was aware of the object of the conspiracy, the five-kilogram deal, and was, therefore, responsible for the whole five kilograms.   In addition, the court denied Jimenez the benefit of U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2, which permits a court to impose punishment without regard to the statutory minimum sentence.   While Jimenez had provided information to the probation department, he did not apprise the United States Attorney's Office, and the court, therefore, found that he had not informed the \"Government\" as required by &#167; 5C1.2(5).   Consequently, Jimenez was subject to the 10 year minimum sentence--not the applicable guideline range of 70-87 months--and was sentenced accordingly to 120 months incarceration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Sentencing:  Moreno</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreno's sentencing hearings took place on March 23 and April 6, 1995.   On March 13, the court denied Moreno's motions for an evidentiary hearing and for issuance of subpoenas to co-conspirators Jimenez and Uroujo to appear as witnesses at his sentencing.   At the first hearing, Moreno testified that his role in the conspiracy was limited to playacting the role of a drug dealer in order to assist Fazio.   He further contended that because he did not have the capability to produce the additional three kilograms of cocaine on February 2, he could not be held responsible for the total negotiated amount of five kilograms.   The court rejected these arguments, finding Moreno responsible for over five kilograms, and increasing his offense level by two in accordance with his role as a manager and supervisor in the conspiracy.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court further found that Moreno had phoned Fazio, and Moreno's wife had visited Fazio, in an effort to influence Fazio's testimony at Moreno's trial.   Accordingly, the court enhanced Moreno's offense level another two levels for obstruction of justice.   Moreno was sentenced to 188 months incarceration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. Sentencing Issues:  Jimenez</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1.

He advances three related arguments against the court's decision holding him accountable for the whole five kilograms negotiated.   First, he claims that the Mojabi affidavit was unreliable and should not have been considered by the court.   Second, he argues that, at the very least, the court should have staged an evidentiary hearing.   Finally, he contends that, without the affidavit, the court's determination was clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Mojabi Affidavit</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Mojabi affidavit was the only piece of direct evidence linking Jimenez to the five-kilogram deal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  In order to place the affidavit in context, we first provide in detail the circumstantial evidence before the court that, according to the government, demonstrated Jimenez's awareness of the deal:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>1. Jimenez was introduced to Fazio as the person who worked for, and transported cocaine for, Moreno.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>2. Moreno told the undercover agent that he intended to use Jimenez in connection with the five-kilogram sale, and Jimenez stored the first installment of two kilograms in his home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>3. Moreno told the agent that Jimenez had modified an automobile to transport up to ten kilograms;  such an automobile was parked in Jimenez's driveway on February 2, 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>4. Moreno told the agent that his \"friend\" would deliver the five kilograms from New York;  the automobile in Jimenez's driveway had a New York registration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>5. The kilogram recovered in November was wrapped in a bag from a store from Queens, New York;  the automobile in Jimenez's driveway was registered to a man who lived in Queens;  and the two kilograms recovered in February were wrapped in bags containing the logo of the New York Times--suggesting that the cocaine had a common origin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>6. Pen register information revealed that between January 6, 1994 and February 2, 1994, 59 calls were placed from Jimenez's residence to Moreno's.   Nineteen of these calls occurred during January 29 and February 2, the days leading up to the deal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>7. Additional quantities of cocaine were found inside Jimenez's home--suggesting that larger quantities of cocaine had been stored there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>8. Jimenez and/or Moreno had ample opportunity to discard or remove the three kilograms of cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contends that Mojabi's affidavit was just one of many factors considered by the court, and that, even in its absence, there was sufficient evidence to support the court's finding.   While we make no determination whether the circumstantial evidence considered alone could have supported the court's finding--i.e., whether it would survive clear error review--we do not consider the evidence so substantial as to make consideration of the affidavit, if erroneous, harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three factors inform our conclusion.   First, the court's question to the government during sentencing--\"Don't I have to rely on Mr. Mojabi's affidavit in order to come to that conclusion [that Jimenez is responsible for the five kilograms]\"--indicates that Mojabi's affidavit was the key piece of evidence.   Second, the probation department, considering the same circumstantial evidence, refused to deem Jimenez responsible for more than the recovered cocaine.   Third, the evidence, though clearly confirming Jimenez's involvement in the conspiracy, is as consistent with Jimenez's participation in only the first stage of the transaction as his awareness of the whole transaction.   Thus, because the affidavit appears to have been the crucial piece of evidence in the district court's finding of drug quantity, we must assess whether it was properly considered by the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the \"court may consider relevant information without regard to its admissibility under the rules of evidence applicable at trial, provided that the information has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 6A1.3(a);  United States v. Tardiff, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587242\"><a href=\"/opinion/587242/united-states-v-claude-paul-tardiff/\"><span class=\"volume\">969</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1283</span></a></span>, 1287 (1st Cir.1992).   The court has wide discretion in determining whether sentencing information is reliable.  United States v. Shrader, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196080\"><a href=\"/opinion/196080/united-states-v-shrader/\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></a></span>, 294 (1st Cir.1995);  Tardiff, 969 F.2d at 1287.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In challenging the affidavit's reliability, Jimenez complains of 1) the lack of corroboration;  2) Mojabi's self interest to implicate Jimenez;  and 3) the improbability that Mojabi could relate a discussion involving Jimenez, given that, purportedly, Mojabi did not speak Spanish and Jimenez did not speak English.   We will address each of these in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Corroboration.  The affidavit, prepared on February 6, 1995, contained information that was not contained in the PSR, the government's objections to the PSR, witness testimony at Moreno's trial, or any contemporaneous document, despite the fact that Mojabi had been cooperating with the government since shortly after his arrest in February, 1994.   Nor is the information in the affidavit corroborated by any of the circumstantial evidence delineated above.   Indeed, the only substantiation the government can muster is that, on the day the meeting described in the affidavit took place, the agent observed Moreno, Fazio and Mojabi arriving together at the restaurant, supporting an inference, perhaps, that Moreno, Fazio and Mojabi met together prior to their arrival.   Jimenez, however, was not seen with the others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Self-Interest.   At sentencing, Jimenez contended that given the plea negotiations between the government and Mojabi, and even independent of any rewards or inducements relating to a plea agreement, Mojabi may have believed that it was in his interest to help the government convict Jimenez of a higher amount of cocaine.   In response, the government stated that there was no written, signed agreement with Mojabi, but that any agreement reached would be breached by the proffering of dishonest information.   In addition, the government asserted that Mojabi was seeking a &#167; 5K1.1 departure, which applies only if the defendant provides truthful assistance.   In other words, according to the government, Mojabi had an obligation, and every incentive, to tell the truth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, the government argued that by placing himself at the scene of the negotiations, Mojabi was subjecting himself to potentially greater criminal liability--demonstrative of credibility as a \"statement against interest.\"   Countering this assertion, Jimenez responded that, under U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.8(a), any self-incriminating information could not be used against Mojabi.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Language Barrier.   Finally, Jimenez contended that Mojabi and Jimenez do not share a common language, Jimenez speaking Spanish and having only minimal understanding of English and Mojabi speaking only English.   As such, Jimenez argued that the affidavit was \"ambiguous on its face.\"   The government did not respond at sentencing to this point, which identifies a discrepancy not easily ignored.   Mojabi did not refer merely to a simple remark.   The affidavit purports to cover Jimenez's comments on the following subjects:  the amount of kilograms to sell, his plan to deliver the cocaine and receive payment, his prior experience in delivery, his lack of fear, his lack of need of a gun, his prior residence in New York, the trust others had in him and their prior employment of him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Separately, these types of complaints are unlikely to carry the day.   As we have previously indicated, courts may consider even uncorroborated affidavits.   See Shrader, 56 F.3d at 294-95 (refusing to adopt a per se rule of unreliability for uncorroborated affidavits of cooperating co-conspirators).   Moreover, a co-defendant's cooperation with the government does not make his statements inherently suspect.   Finally, the resolution of factual discrepancies is especially within the court's domain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are nonetheless convinced that in this case the district court erred in relying on the Mojabi affidavit.   Most significantly, Jimenez's claim, uncontested by the government at sentencing, that he and Mojabi shared no common language raised an important doubt about the reliability of the affidavit.   Faced with this challenge to Mojabi's credibility, and with little other probative evidence of Jimenez's involvement with the latter transaction, the court should not have chosen simply to credit the affidavit without looking into the matter further.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are also influenced, though to a lesser extent, by two other considerations:  1) there was little basis here on which to premise a credibility determination--the affiant had never appeared before the court or grand jury nor did anyone ever attest to his veracity;  and 2) there was no corroboration whatsoever of the content of Mojabi's statement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, in light of these circumstances, we are somewhat concerned by the court's failure to articulate any reason why the affidavit was reliable.   After hearing counsel debate Mojabi's credibility, the court announced:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>I've considered the arguments of counsel and the submissions that were made to the Court before oral argument.   And as a result thereof, the Court finds that the defendant ... was aware of negotiations between the other codefendants and the undercover agent to sell at least five kilograms of cocaine....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the clear dispute over reliability, the court did not mention the affidavit, or any other evidence, at all.   While we assume that the \"arguments\" and \"submissions\" referred to included, inter alia, the Mojabi affidavit, indicating that the court found that the affidavit was reliable,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> the court's conclusory pronouncement diminishes our confidence that it fully considered this important issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most likely, doubts about the Mojabi affidavit could have been resolved by holding an evidentiary hearing, as Jimenez requested.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Such hearings may be burdensome, but the stakes here were high:  the affidavit provided the crucial evidence of the amount of drugs that could be attributed to Jimenez, and as much as four years in prison were riding on the issue.   While the district court has considerable discretion in deciding whether it has sufficient evidence upon which to make a finding at sentencing, here the district court's decision to rely on the affidavit without an evidentiary hearing was error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contends that the court adequately dealt with the reliability issue by taking a full proffer from Jimenez of facts in support of his position.   Such an opportunity may often be sufficient to allay reliability concerns.   See Shrader, 56 F.3d at 295.   But in this case, Jimenez's proffer raised an important doubt about the reliability of Mojabi's affidavit--the language discrepancy--that the government did not refute and that the court did not resolve;  the affidavit was by far the most important evidence on the issue of drug quantity, and the stakes for defendant were extremely high.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore vacate Jimenez's sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing in a manner consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The Safety Valve Exception</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1994, Congress enacted 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f), which, in certain cases, limits the application of mandatory minimum sentences.   Pursuant to this provision, when a convicted defendant meets five delineated requirements,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> the district court \"shall\" impose a sentence in accordance with the guidelines without regard to any statutory minimum sentence.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f);  U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2.   The parties agree that Jimenez meets the first four requirements, but dispute whether Jimenez's disclosure to a probation officer, but not the United States Attorney, constitutes providing information to the \"Government\" as understood under &#167; 5C1.2(5).   We review this question of legal interpretation under the guidelines de novo.  United States v. Gary, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196508\"><a href=\"/opinion/196508/united-states-v-gary/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></a></span>, 315 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither the United States Code nor the Sentencing Guidelines contains a specific definition of \"government.\"   Jimenez thus advances a generic conception derived from a dictionary:  \"the executive branch of the United States Federal Government.\"   Jimenez asserts that this characterization includes the probation department.   For additional support, Jimenez contends, correctly, that aspects of the sentencing procedures contemplate some disclosure to the probation officer.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 6A1.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In resolving this issue, we are guided by the use of the word \"government\" in other relevant provisions, and by legislative history.   Section 5C1.2 provides that \"prior to its determination, the court shall afford the government an opportunity to make a recommendation\" and cites Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(a)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Section 5C1.2 comment.  (n.8.).   Under this procedural rule, \"government\" implicitly identifies the prosecutorial authority.   See United States v. Rodriguez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"699565\"><a href=\"/opinion/699565/united-states-v-ernesto-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span>, 196 &amp; n. 3 (5th Cir.1995) (relying on, inter alia, the doctrine of in pari materia in holding that statements to a probation officer do not satisfy &#167; 5C1.2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also think that &#167; 5C1.2 is properly understood in conjunction with &#167; 5K1.1, which authorizes downward departure upon the government's motion that the defendant has provided substantial assistance to authorities.   The second clause of &#167; 5C1.2(5)--securing the benefit of the \"safety valve\" even if the fully disclosing defendant \"has no useful other information\" or the \"Government is already aware\"--seems specifically designed to reward forthcoming defendants who cannot satisfy &#167; 5K1.1.   It seems evident that section 5K1.1's reference to the \"government\" and to \"substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person\" contemplates the defendant's provision of information useful in criminal prosecutions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The house report accompanying the 1994 bill reinforces the notion that the provision requires disclosure of information of a type that would aid prosecutors' investigative work.   It states that, \"by the time of sentencing, the defendant must have fully assisted the Government by providing all relevant information regarding the offense.\"   H.R.Rep. No. 460, 103d Cong., 2d Sess.  (1994) (emphasis added).   We think this contemplates more than the summary of the crime typically provided by a defendant to a probation officer.   Our conclusion is further buttressed by the timing component of &#167; 5C1.2(5)--requiring provision of all information to the Government \"not later than the time of the sentencing hearing\"--which necessarily anticipates communication that could occur after the creation of the presentence report, indicating that something other than ordinary disclosure to a probation officer is intended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While full disclosure to the probation officer may assist the officer in preparing the defendant's presentence report, we do not believe that &#167; 5C1.2 was meant to extend so far.   The probation officer does not create a presentence report with an eye to future prosecutions or investigations.   Indeed, in that context, the disclosure of one's role is the domain of \"acceptance of responsibility.\"   Section 5C1.2, like 5K1.1, requires more affirmative involvement in the prosecutorial function.   Cf. United States v. Wrenn, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196312\"><a href=\"/opinion/196312/united-states-v-wrenn/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.1995) (requiring an affirmative act of cooperation).   See also United States v. Ivester, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"712094\"><a href=\"/opinion/712094/united-states-v-sidney-wayne-ivester/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">182</span></a></span>, 185 (4th Cir.1996);  United States v. Acosta-Olivas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"709087\"><a href=\"/opinion/709087/united-states-v-jesus-acosta-olivas/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">375</span></a></span>, 378 (10th Cir.1995) (stating that the defendant must disclose \"everything he knows about his own actions and those of his co-conspirators.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we conclude that \"government\" in &#167; 5C1.2(5) refers to the prosecutorial authority.   Accordingly, we affirm the district court's holding that Jimenez did not satisfy the requirements of the \"safety valve\" provision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.

We review factbound matters in sentencing for clear error, mindful that such factual findings need only be supported by a preponderance of the evidence.  United States v. Martinez-Martinez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"707600\"><a href=\"/opinion/707600/united-states-v-olivia-martinez-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1215</span></a></span>, 1224 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite Moreno's efforts to distance himself from the two-kilogram seizure, it is a reasonable conclusion that the recovered cocaine constituted the first stage of the five-kilogram deal.   In turn, it is entirely plausible to conclude that Moreno, having the capability to produce the first part of the deal, had the capability to consummate the deal, particularly when the two stages were to take place in close succession.   See United States v. Legarda, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195229\"><a href=\"/opinion/195229/united-states-v-legarda/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">496</span></a></span>, 501 (1st Cir.1994) (\"entirely plausible ... that defendant, having delivered eleven kilograms of cocaine one week, was capable of delivering ten kilograms the following week\").

We agree.   In United States v.

In a subsequent case, we stated \"if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence in regard to an aborted narcotics transaction that the defendant had either the intent or the capacity to deliver the full amount of the drugs under negotiation, then that amount must be included in the drug quantity calculation,\" United States v.

Very clearly, then, Moreno's concession of intent also disposes of this issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2.

The court found that Moreno \"attempted to influence a witness in this case by actions of his own and through actions of his common law wife\" and increased his offense level by two levels.   We review the court's determination for clear error.   See United States v. Gonzales, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195106\"><a href=\"/opinion/195106/united-states-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">298</span></a></span>, 299 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PSR reported that Moreno, from prison, and his girlfriend contacted Fazio several times in an effort to induce him to testify that Moreno had a subordinate role in the conspiracy.   Moreno, in his objections to the PSR and at his sentencing hearing, did not deny that he or his girlfriend had contacted Fazio but contended that he was trying to \"urge him to tell the truth.\"   In contrast, Fazio's testimony during Moreno's trial indicates that Moreno attempted to script his testimony.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Credibility determinations at sentencing are the province of the court, and are scrutinized only for clear error.  United States v. Webster, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196037\"><a href=\"/opinion/196037/united-states-v-webster/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.1995).   Here, Moreno concedes that the communication took place.   He admits to the basic content of the communication:  asking Fazio to testify that his [Moreno's] role in the conspiracy consisted of acting the part of a drug dealer.   Moreno's only offered justification is that he was encouraging Fazio to tell the truth.   In our view, after presiding over Moreno's trial, and having extensive opportunity to observe Fazio and Moreno, the court's rejection of Moreno's version of events easily survives clear error review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreno argues, further, that the court made no specific findings of the \"words used, the speaker's meaning, or what a listener's reasonable interpretation would be.\"   At sentencing, the judge is required to \"state in open court the reasons for [the] imposition of the particular sentence.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(c).   Here, the court stated its finding that Moreno attempted to influence a witness, a clear example of obstruction of justice.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1 comment.  (n. 3(a)).   The narrow scope of the issue in dispute, the specific findings in the PSR, which were adopted by the district judge as evidenced by the judgment form, and the extensive discussion at sentencing sufficiently enable effective appellate review.   This was enough to satisfy &#167; 3553(c).   See United States v. Catano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196298\"><a href=\"/opinion/196298/united-states-v-catano/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">219</span></a></span>, 230 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v.

Moreno had an opportunity to cross-examine Fazio and the agent, and succeeded in introducing Fazio's possible bias.   And, at his sentencing hearing, Moreno testified extensively in support of his version of events.   In sum, Moreno had a more than adequate opportunity to present information on any factor reasonably in dispute.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 6A1.3(a).   Further testimony from Jimenez and Uroujo would have served no purpose.
