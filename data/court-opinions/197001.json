Appellant-defendant Robert R.

We affirm the conviction.\r\n\n     I.  Failure  to  Grant   Continuance  to  Review  Jencks\r                                                                         \r\n\nMaterial       \"A trial court has wide discretion to grant or\r                    \r\n\ndeny  a request  for continuance.   'Only an  unreasoning and\r\n\narbitrary insistence  upon expeditiousness  in the face  of a\r\n\njustifiable  request  for delay  violates  the  right to  the\r\n\nassistance of counsel' and  would amount to an abuse  of that\r\n\ndiscretion.\"  United States  v. Brand, 80 F.3d 560,  564 (1st\r                                                 \r\n\nCir. 1996)(citation  omitted).  In determining  whether there\r\n\nhas  been an abuse of discretion,  this court should consider\r\n\n\"appellants'  special reasons, plus  relevant factors such as\r\n\nthe amount of time needed  for effective preparation and  the\r\n\namount actually available,  diligence in preparing  for trial\r\n\nand  whether  the  defense   contributed  to  its   perceived\r\n\npredicament,   the   likely   utility   of   a   continuance,\r\n\ninconvenience to  the court,  opposing party,  and witnesses,\r\n\nand any unfair prejudice caused by the denial.\" Id.\r                                                               \r\n\n     \"The Jencks  Act by its  terms limits disclosure  of the\r\n\ndisputed information until after a witness' direct testimony.\r\n\n18  U.S.C.    3500(a).   The  district  court then,  'in  its\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\ndiscretion, upon application  of [the] defendant, may  recess\r\n\nproceedings in the trial for such time as it may determine to\r\n\nbe reasonably required for  the examination of such statement\r\n\nby  said defendant  and his  preparation for  its use  in the\r\n\ntrial.' 18 U.S.C.   3500(c).\"  United States v. Arboleda, 929\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 858, 863(1st Cir. 1991).  \r\n\n     Here, appellant  contributed to  his own  predicament by\r\n\nfailing to request  a continuance prior to  cross-examination\r\n\nor  at  any  time  during Francisco's  testimony.    Although\r\n\ndefense  counsel was  given  the Jencks  material before  the\r\n\nstart of  Francisco's  cross-examination, appellant  did  not\r\n\nrequest a  continuance to review the  transcripts until after\r\n\nthe  government  had begun  direct  examination  of its  next\r\n\nwitness.  Moreover,   appellant  has   failed  to   show  \"'a\r\n\nparticular  detriment  suffered   as  a  result  of   delayed\r\n\ndisclosure.'\"  Id.  at 864.    In light  of  the considerable\r                             \r\n\nevidence linking  appellant to the assault  on Francisco, the\r\n\ncourt's  refusal  to  grant  a  continuance  --  even  if  it\r\n\nprecluded   cross-examination    on   Francisco's   allegedly\r\n\ninconsistent  testimony about the color of the car -- did not\r\n\nseriously prejudice the defense.\r\n\n     II. Failure to Read Back Testimony\r                                                   \r\n\n     \"[W]e  have  long  and  repeatedly  held that  rereading\r\n\ntestimony during  jury deliberations rests  in the presider's\r\n\nsound discretion.\"  United States  v. Akitoye, 923  F.2d 221,\r                                                         \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n226 (1st Cir. 1991).  In Akitoye, we ruled  that the district\r                                            \r\n\ncourt had  not abused  its discretion in  denying the  jury's\r\n\nspecific  request  for  testimony  to   be  read  back.    We\r\n\nemphasized  that \"[t]he  trial  was brief  and the  testimony\r\n\nfresh in  the jurors' minds, a  circumstance which ordinarily\r\n\nlessens the need for  rereading.\" Id. at 226.  We  also noted\r                                                 \r\n\nthat  the  request  was  \"broad  and  general  --  not  'well\r\n\nfocused.'\" Id.  \r                          \r\n\n     The factors supporting the denial of a reread in Akitoye\r                                                                         \r\n\nwere also  present in this  case.  The  trial in the  instant\r\n\ncase lasted for  less than two days.  The  testimony that the\r\n\njury sought to  review had  been given only  the day  before.\r\n\nAlthough defense  counsel suggested that the  jury might want\r\n\nto further focus its request, the jury did not pick up on the\r\n\nsuggestion.    Nor did  defense counsel  specifically request\r\n\nthat the jury  be questioned regarding the particular area of\r\n\nconfusion that had led to the transcript  request.  Moreover,\r\n\nthe  jury in  this case  never specifically requested  a read\r\n\nback  once it was told that the transcript was not available.\r\n\nThere was no abuse of discretion.\r\n\n     III. Sufficient Evidence of Knowledge\r                                                      \r\n\n     Appellant argues that  \"the prosecution failed to  prove\r\n\n'knowledge' of any  degree that the Appellant  was aware that\r\n\nFrancisco implicated the Appellant in any federal  proceeding\r\n\nor  that any federal matter  was pending.\" Under  18 U.S.C.  \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n1512(b), it  is unlawful to \"knowingly  use[] intimidation or\r\n\nphysical  force [or to threaten]  . . .  another person, with\r\n\nintent to . . . influence,  delay or prevent the testimony of\r\n\nany  person  in  an  official proceeding.\"    \"[A]n  official\r\n\nproceeding need not be  pending or about to be  instituted at\r\n\nthe time of  the offense.\" 18 U.S.C.    1512(e)(1).  \"Both  a\r\n\nfederal  trial and  a  federal grand  jury investigation  are\r\n\n'official proceedings' within  the meaning  of the  statute.\"\r\n\nUnited States  v. Frankhauser,  80 F.3d  641,  651 (1st  Cir.\r                                         \r\n\n1996).  \r\n\n     \"Section  1513(b)   requires   proof  of   (1)   knowing\r\n\nengagement in  conduct; (2) either causing  or threatening to\r\n\ncause, bodily injury  to another person;  (3) with intent  to\r\n\nretaliate  against  any  person for,  inter  alia,  providing\r\n\ninformation relating to the commission of a federal offense.\"\r\n\nUnited  States v. Paradis, 802 F.2d 553, 562 (1st Cir. 1986).\r                                     \r\n\nTherefore, to prove intent to retaliate against a witness, it\r\n\nis  necessary to  prove knowledge  by the defendant  that the\r\n\nwitness provided information relating  to the commission of a\r\n\nfederal offense.\r\n\n     \"On appeal,  [this court]  review[s] a challenge  to the\r\n\nsufficiency of  the evidence under a familiar  standard.  The\r\n\nevidence must be viewed  'in the light most favorable  to the\r\n\ngovernment, drawing  all legitimate inferences  and resolving\r\n\nall  credibility  determinations in  favor  of the  verdict.'\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nThus probed, the verdict must be upheld if any rational trier\r\n\nof fact could have found the elements of the offense beyond a\r\n\nreasonable doubt.\" United States v. Victor, 973 F.2d 975, 977\r                                                      \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1992)(citations omitted).\r\n\n     In this  case, there was sufficient  evidence from which\r\n\nthe jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt both that\r\n\nappellant was aware of  Francisco's past cooperation with the\r\n\nfederal  authorities  and that  appellant  at  least expected\r\n\nthere to be a future  federal proceeding.  In the context  of\r\n\nthe evidence as a  whole, appellant's statements to Francisco\r\n\non  August   15,  1995,  were  \"direct   evidence  that  [the\r\n\ndefendant] in fact expected a grand jury investigation and/or\r\n\na trial in the foreseeable future, and that his intent was to\r\n\n[prevent the witness from testifying at] such a proceeding or\r\n\nproceedings.\" Frankhauser, 80 F.3d at 652.  Appellant  is not\r                                     \r\n\nentitled  to  relief on  his  insufficiency  of the  evidence\r\n\nclaim.\r\n\n     IV. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\r                                                      \r\n\n     \"To  obtain  a  reversal  on the  basis  of  ineffective\r\n\nassistance of counsel a  defendant must show that there  is a\r\n\nreasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional\r\n\nerrors,  the factfinder  would  have had  a reasonable  doubt\r\n\nrespecting guilt.\"  United  States v. Palow, 777 F.2d  52, 57\r                                                       \r\n\n(1st  Cir.  1985),  cert.   denied,  475  U.S.  1052  (1986).\r                                              \r\n\nAppellant  raised the ineffective assistance claim before the\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\ndistrict  court in his motion for  a new trial.  The district\r\n\ncourt  ruled that  appellant  had failed  to claim  prejudice\r\n\n\"other  than to  say that  somehow Mr.  Williams' performance\r\n\nfell below the  performance one would  expect of an  attorney\r\n\nunder the circumstances.\"   We agree with  the district court\r\n\nthat   appellant  has   failed   to  demonstrate   prejudice.\r\n\nAccordingly, we need not reach the issue of whether counsel's\r\n\nperformance was deficient.\r\n\n     A.   Failure   to   Cross-Examine  Francisco   Regarding\r                                                                         \r\n\nInconsistencies  in Testimony on the Color of the Car.  There\r                                                                  \r\n\nwas  no prejudice from this failure for the reasons discussed\r\n\nabove  in connection  with  the court's  failure  to grant  a\r\n\ncontinuance.   Viewed  in the context  of the evidence  as  a\r\n\nwhole, the alleged inconsistency  does not raise a reasonable\r\n\ndoubt  that  if  the  jury  had  been  confronted  with  that\r\n\ninconsistency, it would have acquitted appellant.\r\n\n     B.   Conflict Between Attorney  and Client.  Appellant's\r                                                           \r\n\nsecond  ineffective  assistance argument  is  that the  trial\r\n\ncourt  erred  in  not  determining  the need  for  a  hearing\r\n\nregarding  the breakdown  in communication  between appellant\r\n\nand his attorney. \"Where the accused voices objections to the\r\n\nappointed counsel,  the trial  court should inquire  into the\r\n\nreasons for the dissatisfaction.\" United States v. Allen, 789\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d  90,  92 (1st  Cir. 1986),  cert.  denied, 479  U.S. 846\r                                                          \r\n\n(1986).  In this  case, however, appellant did not  voice any\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nobjections  to  counsel and,  therefore,  the  court was  not\r\n\nobliged to make an inquiry into the cause of dissatisfaction.\r\n\n      Although  appellant never  requested  a continuance  or\r\n\nsubstitution of  counsel, the  district  court's response  to\r\n\ndefense  counsel's comments at the start of the second day of\r\n\ntrial implied that it  had found that there was not  a \"total\r\n\nlack of communication preventing an adequate defense.\" United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Pierce,  60 F.3d  886, 891 (1st  Cir. 1995),  cert.\r                                                                         \r\n\ndenied,     U.S.   ,  116 S. Ct.  2580 (1996).   That implied\r                  \r\n\nfinding  is  supported  by   the  record.    Defense  counsel\r\n\nhesitated even to characterize the difference of opinion as a\r\n\ndisagreement.   The  transcript of  the second  day of  trial\r\n\nindicates  appellant  and  his  attorney  were  communicating\r\n\neffectively.  The district court did not err.\r\n\n     C.   Failure to Call Kenneth Landry as a Witness.\r                                                                  \r\n\n     \"The decision  whether to  call a particular  witness is\r\n\nalmost   always  strategic,  requiring  a  balancing  of  the\r\n\nbenefits  and risks  of the  anticipated testimony.\"  Lema v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nUnited  States, 987 F.2d 48,  54 (1st Cir.  1993).  Appellant\r                          \r\n\nhas failed to show  how the failure to call  Landry \"deprived\r\n\nhim of a 'viable defense.'\" United States v. Porter, 924 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n395,  397  (1st  Cir.  1991).   Testimony  by  Francisco  and\r\n\nGonzvales  that  the  Subaru  was  \"dark-colored\"  does   not\r\n\ncontradict Landry's statement  that the car  was black.   The\r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\nfailure  of  Francisco  and   Gonzvales  to  comment  on  the\r\n\nnoisiness  of the Subaru  is inconsequential in  light of the\r\n\nconsiderable other  evidence linking appellant  to the events\r\n\nat Francisco's  shop on  August  15, 1995.   The  ineffective\r\n\nassistance of counsel claim fails.\r\n\n     For all of the  above reasons, appellant's conviction is\r\n\nsummarily affirmed.  See Loc. R. 27.1.  \r                                    \r\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n",

In determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion, this court should consider \"appellants' special reasons, plus relevant factors such as the amount of time needed for effective preparation and the amount actually available, diligence in preparing for trial and whether the defense contributed to its perceived predicament, the likely utility of a continuance, inconvenience to the court, opposing party, and witnesses, and any unfair prejudice caused by the denial.\"   Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The Jencks Act by its terms limits disclosure of the disputed information until after a witness' direct testimony.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3500(a).

Although defense counsel was given the Jencks material before the start of Francisco's cross-examination, appellant did not request a continuance to review the transcripts until after the government had begun direct examination of its next witness.  Moreover, appellant has failed to show \" 'a particular detriment suffered as a result of delayed disclosure.' \"   Id. at 864.

Although defense counsel suggested that the jury might want to further focus its request, the jury did not pick up on the suggestion.  Nor did defense counsel specifically request that the jury be questioned regarding the particular area of confusion that had led to the transcript request.  Moreover, the jury in this case never specifically requested a read back once it was told that the transcript was not available.

Paradis, 802 F.2d 553, 562 (1st Cir.1986).

In the context of the evidence as a whole, appellant's statements to Francisco on August 15, 1995, were \"direct evidence that [the defendant] in fact expected a grand jury investigation and/or a trial in the foreseeable future, and that his intent was to [prevent the witness from testifying at] such a proceeding or proceedings.\"   Frankhauser, 80 F.3d at 652.

Palow, 777 F.2d 52, 57 (1st Cir.1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1052 (1986).  Appellant raised the ineffective assistance claim before the district court in his motion for a new trial.  The district court ruled that appellant had failed to claim prejudice \"other than to say that somehow Mr. Williams' performance fell below the performance one would expect of an attorney under the circumstances.\"   We agree with the district court that appellant has failed to demonstrate prejudice.  Accordingly, we need not reach the issue of whether counsel's performance was deficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.

There was no prejudice from this failure for the reasons discussed above in connection with the court's failure to grant a continuance.

Appellant's second ineffective assistance argument is that the trial court erred in not determining the need for a hearing regarding the breakdown in communication between appellant and his attorney.  \"Where the accused voices objections to the appointed counsel, the trial court should inquire into the reasons for the dissatisfaction.\"   United States v. Allen, 789 F.2d 90, 92 (1st Cir.1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 846 (1986).  In this case, however, appellant did not voice any objections to counsel and, therefore, the court was not obliged to make an inquiry into the cause of dissatisfaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although appellant never requested a continuance or substitution of counsel, the district court's response to defense counsel's comments at the start of the second day of trial implied that it had found that there was not a \"total lack of communication preventing an adequate defense.\"   United States v. Pierce, 60 F.3d 886, 891 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 2580 (1996).  That implied finding is supported by the record.  Defense counsel hesitated even to characterize the difference of opinion as a disagreement.  The transcript of the second day of trial indicates appellant and his attorney were communicating effectively.
