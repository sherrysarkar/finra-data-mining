The United States appeals from the\r\n\ndismissal, on due process grounds, of an indictment against\r\n\ndefendant-appellee Ronald A.X. Stokes. Because the district court\r\n\nacted improvidently and in excess of its authority, we reverse.\r\n\nI. BACKGROUND\r\n\n          The factual foundation of the case is laid elsewhere, \r                                                                        see\r\n\nUnited  \r                 States v.   Stokes, 947 F. Supp. 546 (D. Mass. 1996);\r\n\nCommonwealth v. Stokes, 653 N.E.2d 180 (Mass. App. Ct.),   review\r\n\ndenied, 655 N.E.2d 1277 (Mass. 1995), and a sketch suffices for\r\n\npresent purposes.\r\n\n          Boston police officers arrested Stokes on December 6,\r\n\n1990, and charged him with first-degree murder, unlawful carriage\r\n\nof a firearm (an AK-47 semi-automatic rifle), and two counts of\r\n\nassault and battery with a dangerous weapon. On August 11, 1992,\r\n\na state court jury acquitted him on the murder charge, but\r\n\nconvicted him on the other three counts. Mindful of both the\r\n\ncircumstances of the crimes and the defendant's recidivism, the\r\n\njudge sentenced him at or near the statutory maximum for each count\r\n\nand made the sentences consecutive. Stokes' anticipated release\r\n\ndate from state confinement is in 2006.\r\n\n          The federal government knew of Stokes' case no later than\r\n\nJune 9, 1993. Still, the federal behemoth did not stir until\r\n\nDecember 5, 1995, when the United States charged Stokes with being\r\n\na felon in possession of a firearm.    See 18 U.S.C. S 922(g)(1)\r\n\n(1994). Stokes moved to dismiss the federal indictment on\r\n\ntemporally oriented grounds. He averred that the prosecution was\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\ntime-barred and that the protracted preindictment delay violated\r\n\n(a) his Fifth Amendment right to due process, (b) his Sixth\r\n\nAmendment right to a speedy trial, and (c) the strictures of Fed.\r\n\nR. Crim. P. 48(b). Following a hearing, the district court took\r\n\nthe unorthodox step of submitting a series of interrogatories to\r\n\nthe government sua sponte.\r\n\n          In the course of those proceedings, the government\r\n\nexplained, among other things, that this prosecution would further\r\n\nthe federal interest in protecting the public from a violent\r\n\ncriminal. The government noted that Stokes, who had accumulated an\r\n\nunrelieved record of bellicose criminality, on this occasion had\r\n\nwielded a particularly lethal weapon, and that, if he were to be\r\n\nconvicted on the federal charge, he could be punished as an armed\r\n\ncareer criminal. The court eventually rejected each of Stokes'\r\n\nclaims. Because the five-year statute of limitations commenced\r\n\nrunning on December 7, 1990, the indictment, handed up on December\r\n\n5, 1995, was timely. See \r                                   United States\r                                                 v. \r                                                    Stokes, 947 F. Supp. at\r\n\n550. Because the defendant made no showing that preindictment\r\n\ndelay caused him actual prejudice or emanated from a prosecution\r\n\neffort to gain an unfair tactical advantage, Stokes' Fifth\r\n\nAmendment claim failed.   See id. at 551. Because an accused's\r\n\nconstitutional right to a speedy trial does not attach until the\r\n\n     The United States Attorney obtained an authorized waiver from\r\nthe Justice Department's Petite policy, an aspirational protocol\r\nwhich seeks to prevent overlapping federal-state prosecutions\r\nabsent a compelling federal interest. See \r                                                    generally \r                                                              United States\r\nv. \r            Gary, 74 F.3d 304, 313 (1st Cir.), \r                                              cert. \r                                                    denied, 116 S. Ct. 2567\r\n(1996).\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nfiling of a charge, the Sixth Amendment offered Stokes no shelter.\r\n\nSee id. at 552. And, finally, the court ruled that Criminal Rule\r\n\n48(b) does not apply to preindictment delay.  See id.\r\n\n          Had the district court stopped at this juncture, these\r\n\nproceedings would be unnecessary. But the judge brooded over the\r\n\nsentencing possibilities. Noting that, regardless of the earlier\r\n\nacquittal, Stokes' sentence could be enhanced to life imprisonment\r\n\nwithout parole if the government obtained a conviction on the\r\n\nfederal weapons charge and then proved at sentencing by a\r\n\npreponderance of the evidence that he had committed the murder, \r                                                                        see\r\n\ngenerally USSG S2K2.1; USSG S1B1.3(a), the judge foresaw \"vexing\r\n\nissues\" of due process, double jeopardy, and selective prosecution.\r\n\nUnited States\r                       v. \r                          Stokes, 947 F. Supp. at 553. While acknowledging\r\n\nthat the prosecution transgressed no established constitutional\r\n\ndoctrine, he identified four factors which, in his estimation, gave\r\n\nrise to \"constitutional implications\": (1) the substantial\r\n\npreindictment delay; (2) a \r                                    de \r                                       facto successive prosecution for the\r\n\nsame firearms offense, albeit by a different sovereign, exacerbated\r\n\nby the prospect of a disparate sentence of mandatory life\r\n\nimprisonment; (3) a  de facto reprosecution, in the guise of a\r\n\nsentencing enhancement, for acquitted conduct (the murder) under a\r\n\nless rigorous standard of proof; and (4) a form of selective\r\n\nprosecution.  Id. at 556-57. He then proceeded to dismiss the\r\n\nindictment, reasoning that \"[a]lthough no one factor, by itself,\r\n\nmay offend constitutional canons, the effect of all of the factors\r\n\nin the aggregate . . . violates the Due Process Clause.\"  Id. at\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\n557. This appeal ensued.\r\n\nII. DISCUSSION\r\n\n          Because the district court's dismissal of the indictment\r\n\non constitutional grounds raises a pure question of law, we\r\n\nexercise plenary review. See \r                                       United States\r                                                     v. \r                                                        Nippon Paper Indus.\r\n\nCo., 109 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1997), petition for cert. filed, 65\r\n\nU.S.L.W. 3839 (U.S. June 13, 1997) (No. 96-1987); \r                                                           United States\r                                                                         v.\r\n\nAguilar-Aranceta, 957 F.2d 18, 21 (1st Cir. 1992). We begin with\r\n\nthe court's aggregation theory and then turn to the court's\r\n\npreoccupation with possible sentencing outcomes. We conclude by\r\n\nconsidering various alternative grounds proffered by the appellee\r\n\nin an attempt to salvage the judgment.\r\n\n                      A.  Aggregate Effect.\r\n\n          The cornerstone of the district court's order is its\r\n\nconclusion that a medley of constitutional concerns, each\r\n\ninsufficient to bar prosecution, added up to a due process\r\n\nviolation and required dismissal of the indictment. The district\r\n\ncourt cited United States v. Lombard, 72 F.3d 170 (1st Cir. 1995)\r\n\n(Lombard \r                   I), as the sole authority for this aggregation theory.\r\n\nLombard I is well wide of the mark.\r\n\n          A state court jury acquitted Lombard on murder charges.\r\n\nA federal court jury subsequently convicted him on federal firearms\r\n\ncharges arising out the same nucleus of operative facts. The trial\r\n\njudge imposed a mandatory life sentence based on preponderant\r\n\nevidence that Lombard used the weapons to commit the murders (of\r\n\nwhich he previously had been acquitted).       See  id. at 172.\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nExpressing but not resolving constitutional concerns about, inter\r\n\nalia, the magnitude of the sentence enhancement, the prior\r\n\nacquittal, the qualitative difference between the sentence-\r\n\nenhancing conduct and the offense of conviction, and the severity\r\n\nof the sentence imposed, the court held that this combination of\r\n\nspecial facts permitted the district court to consider a downward\r\n\ndeparture at sentencing.  See id. at 180, 184-85; see also United\r\n\nStates v. Lombard, 102 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1996) (   Lombard \r                                                                        II)\r\n\n(explicating previous panel decision),  cert. denied, 117 S. Ct.\r\n\n2437 (1997).\r\n\n          Lombard \r                            I offers no support for the dismissal of the\r\n\nindictment in this case.      Lombard  \r                                                I is a sentencing case,\r\n\nelaborating on departure principles, and its analysis is unique to\r\n\nthe milieu of the federal sentencing guidelines. \r                                                          See \r                                                              Lombard I\r                                                                       , 72\r\n\nF.3d at 183-87; see generally Koon v.  United \r                                                        States, 116 S. Ct.\r\n\n2035, 2044-45 (1996). Judge Harrington transposed the statements\r\n\ncontained in \r                      Lombard I\r                                from the sentencing context to the pretrial\r\n\ncontext. Tugging those statements so far from their moorings\r\n\nempties them of meaning.\r\n\n          Moreover, Judge Harrington's reading of   Lombard \r                                                                      I is\r\n\nundone by \r                   Lombard II\r                              (which, in all fairness, was decided some two\r\n\nweeks after Judge Harrington ruled).    Lombard \r                                                          I resulted in a\r\n\nremand for further consideration of the appropriate sentence. 72\r\n\nF.3d at 187.  Lombard \r                                II upheld the district court's denial of a\r\n\ndownward departure and its reimposition of a sentence of life\r\n\nimprisonment. 102 F.3d at 2-3, 5. This result refutes Judge\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nHarrington's vision of  Lombard  \r                                           I as the progenitor of a new\r\n\nconstitutional dogma. The short of it is that the district court\r\n\ndid not cite, and we have not unearthed, any authority for the\r\n\nproposition that individual factors, none of which crosses\r\n\nconstitutional boundaries, may violate the Constitution in the\r\n\naggregate. While perhaps some strange concatenation of\r\n\ncircumstances lurks at the outer periphery of constitutional\r\n\ndoctrine, we are confident that, on the facts of this case, the\r\n\nwhole is no more than the sum of the parts.\r\n\n          In a gallant effort to hold his gains, Stokes' able\r\n\ncounsel points out that we have recognized in other contexts the\r\n\nprinciple of cumulative effect.    See,  e.g., United  \r                                                                 States v.\r\n\nSepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1195-96 (1st Cir. 1993); \r                                                           United States\r                                                                         v.\r\n\nDwyer, 843 F.2d 60, 65 (1st Cir. 1988). That is true as far as it\r\n\ngoes   but it does not go very far. While trial errors which in\r\n\nisolation appear harmless may have a cumulative effect so\r\n\nprejudicial as to require reversal, the operation of that principle\r\n\ndepends on the existence of two or more errors. By definition,\r\n\ncumulative-error analysis is inappropriate when a party complains\r\n\nof the cumulative effect of non-errors.  See Hoxsie v. Kerby, 108\r\n\nF.3d 1239, 1245 (10th Cir. 1997),  petition for cert. filed,    \r\n\nU.S.L.W.     (U.S. June 9, 1997) (No. 96-9364). Here, as Judge\r\n\nHarrington himself concluded, each individual claim of\r\n\nconstitutional error misfires. Thus, we cannot endorse the curious\r\n\nalchemy by which the lower court transformed an array of\r\n\nconstitutionally acceptable factors into a constitutional\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nabomination.\r\n\n                 B.  Sentencing Considerations.\r\n\n          The court below dwelt at some length on the potentially\r\n\nsevere sentence that Stokes might receive if he were convicted on\r\n\nthe federal charge. The court's reliance on this factor as a basis\r\n\nfor granting relief was at best premature.\r\n\n          In the normal course of events, a facially valid\r\n\nindictment returned by a duly constituted grand jury calls for a\r\n\ntrial on the merits. See \r                                   Costello v. \r                                               United States\r                                                            , 350 U.S. 359,\r\n\n363 (1956); United States v. Rodriguez, 738 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir.\r\n\n1984). Because the public maintains an abiding interest in the\r\n\nadministration of criminal justice, dismissing an indictment is an\r\n\nextraordinary step.  See United States v. Morrison, 449 U.S. 361,\r\n\n363-64 (1981). Even when evidence of a constitutional infraction\r\n\nlooms, remedies ordinarily \"should be tailored to the injury\r\n\nsuffered from the constitutional violation and should not\r\n\nunnecessarily infringe on competing interests.\" \r                                                         Id. at 364. Thus,\r\n\nan indictment should not be dismissed with prejudice when other\r\n\nmeans exist to correct a constitutional breach.  See id. at 365;\r\n\ncf. United \r                     States v.  Hastings, 847 F.2d 920, 928-29 (1st Cir.\r\n\n1988).\r\n\n          This principle applies in regard to sentencing: when the\r\n\nsupposed constitutional infirmity derives from particular\r\n\nattributes of a sentence imposed, the scope of relief is limited to\r\n\nexcising the taint from the sentence. \r                                               See, \r                                                    e.g., \r                                                          Coker v. \r                                                                   Georgia,\r\n\n433 U.S. 584, 600 (1977); United States v. Connell, 960 F.2d 191,\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\n196-97 (1st Cir. 1992). Though we take no view as to whether the\r\n\nconcerns to which the district court alluded might warrant relief\r\n\nat the sentencing stage, see generally United \r                                                        States v.  Saldana,\r\n\n109 F.3d 100, 104 (1st Cir. 1997) (acknowledging the possibility\r\n\nthat the timing of an indictment might, in some circumstances,\r\n\n\"produce[] sentencing consequences so unusual and unfair that a\r\n\ndeparture would be permissible\"), those concerns are properly\r\n\nreserved for consideration at the time of sentencing. They have\r\n\nno bearing on the question of whether a trial should go forward.\r\n\n          The anatomy of the doctrine of preindictment delay\r\n\nstrengthens our conviction that Judge Harrington prematurely\r\n\nconsidered post-conviction possibilities. Dismissal for\r\n\npreindictment delay on due process grounds requires, inter alia, a\r\n\nshowing of actual prejudice. See \r                                          United States\r                                                        v. \r                                                           Marion, 404 U.S.\r\n\n307, 325-26 (1971); Acha v. United \r                                              States, 910 F.2d 28, 32 (1st\r\n\nCir. 1990) (per curiam). Accordingly, courts regularly have found\r\n\nclaims of prejudice related to sentencing possibilities too\r\n\nspeculative to implicate a defendant's due process right.    See,\r\n\ne.g., United States v. Martinez, 77 F.3d 332, 336 (9th Cir. 1996)\r\n\n(rebuffing the defendant's pretrial claim of prejudice from the\r\n\neffects of preindictment delay on his likely sentence because the\r\n\nguidelines provided leeway for departures); \r                                                    United States\r                                                                  v. \r                                                                     McCoy,\r\n\n     We note in passing that one of the principal constitutional\r\nconcerns underlying the district court's opinion, 947 F. Supp. at\r\n553, has proven to be unfounded.  See United States v. Watts, 117\r\nS. Ct. 633, 637-38 (1997) (per curiam) (upholding the\r\nconstitutionality of considering acquitted conduct, under a\r\npreponderance standard, for sentence-enhancement purposes).\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\n977 F.2d 706, 711 (1st Cir. 1992) (rejecting as conjectural the\r\n\nargument that preindictment delay reduced the defendant's\r\n\nopportunity to serve concurrent terms on state and federal\r\n\ncharges). So it is here: whether Stokes' case ultimately will\r\n\nreach the sentencing stage, and if so, what sentence will be\r\n\nimposed, are questions reserved for an uncertain future. By\r\n\npremising his analysis of the indictment's trialworthiness on the\r\n\nconstitutional implications of a life sentence not yet imposed\r\n\n(and, perhaps, never to be imposed), Judge Harrington jumped the\r\n\ngun by several paces.\r\n\n          To recapitulate, sentencing issues are properly addressed\r\n\nduring the sentencing phase of federal criminal trials. The\r\n\ndistrict court's flagrant contradiction of this tenet constituted\r\n\nlegal error.\r\n\n                   C.  Miscellaneous Grounds.\r\n\n          Stokes attempts to confess and avoid. If the district\r\n\ncourt erred in its reasoning, he says, its result nevertheless is\r\n\ndefensible as a condign remedy for prosecutorial vindictiveness, or\r\n\nas a concinnous exercise of the court's supervisory powers, or\r\n\nbecause the district court erred when it failed to dismiss the\r\n\nindictment on the basis of preindictment delay. We weigh each\r\n\nasseveration.\r\n\n          1.  Prosecutorial \r                                      Vindictiveness. It is hornbook law\r\n\nthat a federal court may dismiss an indictment if the accused\r\n\nproduces evidence of actual prosecutorial vindictiveness sufficient\r\n\nto establish a due process violation, or even if he demonstrates a\r\n\n                               10\r\r\n\nlikelihood of vindictiveness sufficient to justify a presumption.\r\n\nSee United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 376, 380 n.12 (1982);\r\n\nUnited \r                 States v. Marrapese, 826 F.2d 145, 147 (1st Cir. 1987).\r\n\nSeizing on a singular reference in the closing paragraph of Judge\r\n\nHarrington's opinion,  Stokes urges us to uphold the court's\r\n\n\"finding\" that prosecutorial vindictiveness occurred here. In\r\n\nmounting this challenge, Stokes eschews a claim of actual\r\n\nvindictiveness, arguing instead that a presumption of\r\n\nvindictiveness arises from the government's admission that it would\r\n\nnot have prosecuted Stokes federally had he been convicted of\r\n\nmurder (and, therefore, given a substantially longer sentence) in\r\n\nthe state court.\r\n\n          We begin this segment of our analysis with a caveat:\r\n\ncourts should go very slowly in embracing presumptions of\r\n\nprosecutorial vindictiveness in pretrial proceedings. \r                                                               See \r                                                                   Goodwin,\r\n\n457 U.S. at 381. Here, moreover, the allegation of vindictiveness\r\n\nis not only oddly timed, but also oddly configured. The sovereign\r\n\nis not alleged to have retaliated, as in the typical case, because\r\n\nan accused, embroiled in a legal battle with it, asserted a legal\r\n\nright. See, \r                      e.g., \r                            Blackledge v. \r                                          Perry, 417 U.S. 21, 28-29 (1974);\r\n\nNorth Carolina\r                        v. \r                           Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 724-25 (1969). Rather, the\r\n\nfederal government is alleged to be acting vindictively in\r\n\nretaliation for an accused's victory in a \r                                                   state case. Since it is\r\n\n     The judge wrote, somewhat cryptically: \"It is not fitting for\r\nthe United States to be vindictive . . . .\"     United \r                                                                 States v.\r\nStokes, 947 F. Supp. at 557.\r\n\n                               11\r\r\n\nwell settled that \"the conduct of two independent sovereigns does\r\n\nnot lend itself to the concept of vindictive prosecution,\" United\r\n\nStates v. \r                   Bassford, 812 F.2d 16, 20 (1st Cir. 1987) (quoting \r                                                                     United\r\n\nStates v. \r                   Ng, 699 F.2d 63, 68 (2d Cir. 1983)), this is a difficult\r\n\nsale to make.\r\n\n          The level of difficulty increases due to the breadth of\r\n\nthe prosecutor's discretion. A federal prosecutor does not have\r\n\nthe resources (time, money, staff) to charge every suspected\r\n\nmalefactor. In picking and choosing, the prosecutor must act in a\r\n\nfair and even-handed manner, and he is constrained by a set of\r\n\nrules and conventions (both legal and ethical). But prosecutors\r\n\nare not required to function as bloodless automatons: they may\r\n\n(indeed, they should) make judgments about dangerousness, set\r\n\npriorities, and give heightened attention to cases which inspire a\r\n\nsense of outrage. This case illustrates the point: the\r\n\ngovernment's decision to refrain from initiating federal criminal\r\n\nproceedings pending the outcome of a parallel (but independent)\r\n\nstate prosecution, and to relax the self-imposed restraint only\r\n\nafter it had been disappointed by the end result of the parallel\r\n\nproceeding, falls squarely within the encincture of this\r\n\nprosecutorial discretion. See \r                                        United States\r                                                      v. \r                                                        Fuzer, 18 F.3d 517,\r\n\n520 (7th Cir. 1994); Ng, 699 F.2d at 68-69. The record indicates\r\n\n     Among other things, showing vindictive prosecution where two\r\nseparate sovereigns are involved would require a finding of\r\ncomplicity between federal and state prosecutors.  See  Bassford,\r\n812 F.2d at 20-21; \r                            Ng, 699 F.2d at 68. There is no basis for such\r\na finding here.\r\n\n                               12\r\r\n\nthat Stokes is a dangerous criminal, and the federal government had\r\n\na perfect right to take a hard look at his case and to determine\r\n\nwhether society's interests call for the unusual step of\r\n\ninstituting a federal prosecution notwithstanding the prior\r\n\ncommencement of a state prosecution for substantially the same\r\n\nconduct.\r\n\n          We need not wax longiloquent. Simply put, the district\r\n\ncourt's inscrutable reference to vindictiveness fails to compensate\r\n\nfor the utter absence of any circumstances from which a trier\r\n\nlegitimately could presume vindictiveness.  See United \r                                                                 States v.\r\n\nSutherland, 929 F.2d 765, 772 n.2 (1st Cir. 1991) (noting that\r\n\nconclusory allegations are insufficient when the record lacks any\r\n\ncompetent evidence of vindictiveness).\r\n\n          2.   Supervisory  \r                                      Powers. The dismissal is equally\r\n\nvulnerable if viewed as an exercise of the district court's\r\n\nsupervisory powers. Such powers enable courts, within limits, to\r\n\nformulate procedural rules not specifically contemplated by the\r\n\nConstitution or codified in positive law.   See United \r                                                                 States v.\r\n\nHasting, 461 U.S. 499, 505 (1983). Thus, courts may invoke their\r\n\nsupervisory powers to implement a remedy for violation of\r\n\nrecognized rights, to preserve judicial integrity, or to deter\r\n\nillegal conduct. See \r                               id.; \r                                    see \r                                        also \r                                             United States\r                                                           v. \r                                                              Horn, 29 F.3d\r\n\n754, 760 (1st Cir. 1994). Even so, courts must use these powers\r\n\n\"sparingly.\"  United \r                               States v.  Santana, 6 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir.\r\n\n1993).\r\n\n          The district court did not explicitly invoke its\r\n\n                               13\r\r\n\nsupervisory powers, but it did voice lingering concerns about\r\n\n\"fundamental fairness\" and \"fair play.\"  United States v. Stokes,\r\n\n947 F. Supp. at 557. Stokes reads these references as reflecting\r\n\nthe court's belief that the government somehow abused its\r\n\nprosecutorial discretion in lodging the indictment and thus denied\r\n\nStokes substantive due process. The facts do not bear out this\r\n\ntheory.\r\n\n          Although dismissing an indictment on substantive due\r\n\nprocess grounds is not unprecedented, it is extremely rare. Such\r\n\na drastic step is reserved for cases of \"serious and blatant\r\n\nprosecutorial misconduct that distorts the integrity of the\r\n\njudicial process.\"  United \r                                     States v. Giorgi, 840 F.2d 1022, 1030\r\n\n(1st Cir. 1988) (citation omitted). The instant case does not\r\n\npresent a suitable occasion for dismissing an indictment in order\r\n\nto vindicate the court's supervisory authority.\r\n\n          In this vein, Stokes' flagship case,  United \r                                                                 States v.\r\n\nRodman, 519 F.2d 1058 (1st Cir. 1975) (per curiam), gains him\r\n\nlittle headway. There, we upheld the trial court's use of inherent\r\n\npower to dismiss charges after the government breached a promise to\r\n\nrecommend against indictment in return for information which\r\n\nincluded self-incriminating statements.    See  id. at 1059-60.\r\n\nRodman illustrates the sort of egregious circumstances which are\r\n\nessential before a court appropriately may unleash its supervisory\r\n\npowers to interfere with the exercise of prosecutorial discretion.\r\n\nThe case at bar   in which the government had the discretion to\r\n\ninitiate a federal prosecution and punctiliously followed\r\n\n                               14\r\r\n\napplicable internal procedures in doing so   is not of that genre.\r\n\n          We give short shrift to Stokes' related allegation that\r\n\nthe indictment was subject to dismissal because of prosecutorial\r\n\nabuse of sentence enhancers. A pretrial dismissal on this basis\r\n\nconstitutes a totally inappropriate use of the court's supervisory\r\n\npowers.  See  supra Part II(B);  see also  Horn, 29 F.3d at 760\r\n\n(warning that courts may not employ their inherent powers to\r\n\njustify extreme remedies when \"satisfactory anodyne[s]\" exist which\r\n\nare \"more narrowly tailored to the objective\").\r\n\n          Finally, to the extent that Judge Harrington was\r\n\ninfluenced in his ruling by his evident personal disagreement with\r\n\nthe government's decision to prosecute Stokes under federal law,\r\n\nhis action was inappropriate. It is a bedrock principle of our\r\n\nsystem of criminal justice that \"the Due Process Clause does not\r\n\npermit courts to abort criminal prosecutions simply because they\r\n\ndisagree with a prosecutor's judgment as to when to seek an\r\n\nindictment.\"  United States v. Lovasco, 431 U.S. 783, 790 (1977);\r\n\naccord Santana, 6 F.3d at 11 (reading Supreme Court precedent as\r\n\n\"admonishing federal courts to refrain from using the supervisory\r\n\npower to conform executive conduct to judicially preferred norms by\r\n\ndismissing charges\" without sufficient legal cause).\r\n\n          In sum, the record contains no inkling of prosecutorial\r\n\nmisconduct, vindictiveness, or other conduct antithetic to\r\n\nsubstantive due process which could justify dismissing the\r\n\nindictment through the exercise of the court's supervisory powers.\r\n\n          3.   Preindictment  \r                                       Delay. Stokes' renewed claim of\r\n\n                               15\r\r\n\nunconstitutional preindictment delay lacks substance. A criminal\r\n\ndefendant who asserts such a claim bears the heavy burden of\r\n\nshowing not only that the preindictment delay caused him actual,\r\n\nsubstantial prejudice, but also that the prosecution orchestrated\r\n\nthe delay to gain a tactical advantage over him.  See Marion, 404\r\n\nU.S. at 324; United States v. Henson, 945 F.2d 430, 439 (1st Cir.\r\n\n1991). The appellee shows neither.\r\n\n          Stokes argues that he satisfied the first prong of the\r\n\ntest because, had the federal government promptly indicted him, he\r\n\nwould have continued searching for a potential defense witness,\r\n\nSherry Parkman, who disappeared between the date of the offense and\r\n\nthe date of the state court trial. Since the appellee was unable\r\n\nto locate the witness at the time of his state trial, there is no\r\n\ncredible reason to believe that the delay on the federal side\r\n\nplaced him in a position less advantageous than he would have\r\n\noccupied had the indictments been contemporaneous.\r\n\n          The appellee's fallback position is that the delay\r\n\nprejudiced him by denying him the benefit of running his state and\r\n\nfederal sentences concurrently. This is pure speculation and,\r\n\nhence, inadequate to the task.  See McCoy, 977 F.2d at 711.\r\n\n          At the expense of carting coal to Newcastle, we add that\r\n\nStokes also fails on the second prong of the test. By all\r\n\naccounts, the government temporized until it knew the result of the\r\n\n     In all events Parkman's statements are ambiguous.        See\r\nCommonwealth v. \r                         Stokes, 653 N.E.2d at 185. Because proof of actual\r\nprejudice must be definite and not speculative, \r                                                         see \r                                                             Acha, 910 F.2d\r\nat 32, this fact, without more, would sink the appellee's argument.\r\n\n                               16\r\r\n\nstate court prosecution. Even then, the government deferred an\r\n\nindictment because it gave priority to the prosecution of offenders\r\n\nwho, unlike Stokes, were not already in custody.\r\n\n          The government's explanation is plausible and\r\n\nunimpeached; it should, therefore, be accepted. See \r                                                              United States\r\n\nv. Marler, 756 F.2d 206, 215 n.6 (1st Cir. 1985). It indicates\r\n\nthat the government acted out of proper motives and achieved no\r\n\nundue tactical advantage. For these reasons, Stokes fails to\r\n\npersuade us that the district court erred in refusing to dismiss\r\n\nthe case based on inordinate preindictment delay.\r\n\nIII. CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We need go no further. It is evident to us that the\r\n\ndistrict court erred as a matter of law in dismissing the case\r\n\nprior to trial. Having obtained a valid indictment within the\r\n\nlimitations period, the government is entitled to try the defendant\r\n\non the merits. Moreover, we think it best that the case be\r\n\ntransferred to a new trier on remand, and we so direct.

Stokes.  Because the district court acted improvidently and in excess of its authority, we reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The factual foundation of the case is laid elsewhere, see United States v. Stokes, 947 F.Supp. 546 (D.Mass.1996);  Commonwealth v. Stokes, 38 Mass.App.Ct. 752, 653 N.E.2d 180, review denied, 421 Mass. 1103, 655 N.E.2d 1277 (1995), and a sketch suffices for present purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Boston police officers arrested Stokes on December 6, 1990, and charged him with first-degree murder, unlawful carriage of a firearm (an AK-47 semi-automatic rifle), and two counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon.  On August 11, 1992, a state court jury acquitted him on the murder charge, but convicted him on the other three counts.  Mindful of both the circumstances of the crimes and the defendant's recidivism, the judge sentenced him at or near the statutory maximum for each count and made the sentences consecutive.  Stokes' anticipated release date from state confinement is in 2006.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The federal government knew of Stokes' case no later than June 9, 1993.  Still, the federal behemoth did not stir until December 5, 1995, when the United States charged Stokes with being a felon in possession of a firearm.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1) (1994).  Stokes moved to dismiss the federal indictment on temporally oriented grounds.  He averred that the prosecution was time-barred and that the protracted preindictment delay violated (a) his Fifth Amendment right to due process, (b) his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial, and (c) the strictures of Fed.R.Crim.P. 48(b).  Following a hearing, the district court took the unorthodox step of submitting a series of interrogatories to the government sua sponte.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the course of those proceedings, the government explained, among other things, that this prosecution would further the federal interest in protecting the public from a violent criminal.  The government noted that Stokes, who had accumulated an unrelieved record of bellicose criminality, on this occasion had wielded a particularly lethal weapon, and that, if he were to be convicted on the federal charge, he could be punished as an armed career criminal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The court eventually rejected each of Stokes' claims.  Because the five-year statute of limitations commenced running on December 7, 1990, the indictment, handed up on December 5, 1995, was timely.  See United States v. Stokes, 947 F.Supp. at 550.   Because the defendant made no showing that preindictment delay caused him actual prejudice or emanated from a prosecution effort to gain an unfair tactical advantage, Stokes' Fifth Amendment claim failed.  See id. at 551.   Because an accused's constitutional right to a speedy trial does not attach until the filing of a charge, the Sixth Amendment offered Stokes no shelter.  See id. at 552.   And, finally, the court ruled that Criminal Rule 48(b) does not apply to preindictment delay.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had the district court stopped at this juncture, these proceedings would be unnecessary.  But the judge brooded over the sentencing possibilities.  Noting that, regardless of the earlier acquittal, Stokes' sentence could be enhanced to life imprisonment without parole if the government obtained a conviction on the federal weapons charge and then proved at sentencing by a preponderance of the evidence that he had committed the murder, see generally USSG &#167; 2K2.1;  USSG &#167; 1B1.3(a), the judge foresaw \"vexing issues\" of due process, double jeopardy, and selective prosecution.  United States v. Stokes, 947 F.Supp. at 553.   While acknowledging that the prosecution transgressed no established constitutional doctrine, he identified four factors which, in his estimation, gave rise to \"constitutional implications\":  (1) the substantial preindictment delay;  (2) a de facto successive prosecution for the same firearms offense, albeit by a different sovereign, exacerbated by the prospect of a disparate sentence of mandatory life imprisonment;  (3) a de facto reprosecution, in the guise of a sentencing enhancement, for acquitted conduct (the murder) under a less rigorous standard of proof;  and (4) a form of selective prosecution.  Id. at 556-57.   He then proceeded to dismiss the indictment, reasoning that \"[a]lthough no one factor, by itself, may offend constitutional canons, the effect of all of the factors in the aggregate ... violates the Due Process Clause.\"  Id. at 557.   This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the district court's dismissal of the indictment on constitutional grounds raises a pure question of law, we exercise plenary review.  See United States v. Nippon Paper Indus. Co., 109 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1997), petition for cert. filed, 65 U.S.L.W. 3839 (U.S. June 13, 1997) (No. 96-1987);  United States v. Aguilar-Aranceta, 957 F.2d 18, 21 (1st Cir.1992).  We begin with the court's aggregation theory and then turn to the court's preoccupation with possible sentencing outcomes.  We conclude by considering various alternative grounds proffered by the appellee in an attempt to salvage the judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>A. Aggregate Effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cornerstone of the district court's order is its conclusion that a medley of constitutional concerns, each insufficient to bar prosecution, added up to a due process violation and required dismissal of the indictment.  The district court cited United States v. Lombard, 72 F.3d 170 (1st Cir.1995) (Lombard I), as the sole authority for this aggregation theory.  Lombard I is well wide of the mark.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A state court jury acquitted Lombard on murder charges.  A federal court jury subsequently convicted him on federal firearms charges arising out the same nucleus of operative facts.  The trial judge imposed a mandatory life sentence based on preponderant evidence that Lombard used the weapons to commit the murders (of which he previously had been acquitted).  See id. at 172.   Expressing but not resolving constitutional concerns about, inter alia, the magnitude of the sentence enhancement, the prior acquittal, the qualitative difference between the sentence-enhancing conduct and the offense of conviction, and the severity of the sentence imposed, the court held that this combination of special facts permitted the district court to consider a downward departure at sentencing.  See id. at 180, 184-85;  see also United States v. Lombard, 102 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1996) (Lombard II) (explicating previous panel decision), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 2437, 138 L.Ed.2d 197 (1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lombard I offers no support for the dismissal of the indictment in this case.  Lombard I is a sentencing case, elaborating on departure principles, and its analysis is unique to the milieu of the federal sentencing guidelines.  See Lombard I, 72 F.3d at 183-87;  see generally Koon v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 2044-45, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996).  Judge Harrington transposed the statements contained in Lombard I from the sentencing context to the pretrial context.  Tugging those statements so far from their moorings empties them of meaning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Judge Harrington's reading of Lombard I is undone by Lombard II (which, in all fairness, was decided some two weeks after Judge Harrington ruled).  Lombard I resulted in a remand for further consideration of the appropriate sentence.  72 F.3d at 187.  Lombard II upheld the district court's denial of a downward departure and its reimposition of a sentence of life imprisonment.  102 F.3d at 2-3, 5. This result refutes Judge Harrington's vision of Lombard I as the progenitor of a new constitutional dogma.  The short of it is that the district court did not cite, and we have not unearthed, any authority for the proposition that individual factors, none of which crosses constitutional boundaries, may violate the Constitution in the aggregate.  While perhaps some strange concatenation of circumstances lurks at the outer periphery of constitutional doctrine, we are confident that, on the facts of this case, the whole is no more than the sum of the parts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a gallant effort to hold his gains, Stokes' able counsel points out that we have recognized in other contexts the principle of cumulative effect.  See, e.g., United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1195-96 (1st Cir.1993);  United States v. Dwyer, 843 F.2d 60, 65 (1st Cir.1988).  That is true as far as it goes--but it does not go very far.  While trial errors which in isolation appear harmless may have a cumulative effect so prejudicial as to require reversal, the operation of that principle depends on the existence of two or more errors.  By definition, cumulative-error analysis is inappropriate when a party complains of the cumulative effect of non-errors.  See Hoxsie v. Kerby, 108 F.3d 1239, 1245 (10th Cir.1997), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 118 S.Ct. 126, --- L.Ed.2d ---- (1997).  Here, as Judge Harrington himself concluded, each individual claim of constitutional error misfires.  Thus, we cannot endorse the curious alchemy by which the lower court transformed an array of constitutionally acceptable factors into a constitutional abomination.B. Sentencing Considerations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court below dwelt at some length on the potentially severe sentence that Stokes might receive if he were convicted on the federal charge.  The court's reliance on this factor as a basis for granting relief was at best premature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the normal course of events, a facially valid indictment returned by a duly constituted grand jury calls for a trial on the merits.  See Costello v. United States, 350 U.S. 359, 363, 76 S.Ct. 406, 408, 100 L.Ed. 397 (1956);  United States v. Rodriguez, 738 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir.1984).  Because the public maintains an abiding interest in the administration of criminal justice, dismissing an indictment is an extraordinary step.  See United States v. Morrison, 449 U.S. 361, 363-64, 101 S.Ct. 665, 666-67, 66 L.Ed.2d 564 (1981).  Even when evidence of a constitutional infraction looms, remedies ordinarily \"should be tailored to the injury suffered from the constitutional violation and should not unnecessarily infringe on competing interests.\"  Id. at 364, 101 S.Ct. at 667.   Thus, an indictment should not be dismissed with prejudice when other means exist to correct a constitutional breach.  See id. at 365, 101 S.Ct. at 668;  cf.  United States v. Hastings, 847 F.2d 920, 928-29 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This principle applies in regard to sentencing:  when the supposed constitutional infirmity derives from particular attributes of a sentence imposed, the scope of relief is limited to excising the taint from the sentence.  See, e.g., Coker v. Georgia, 433 U.S. 584, 600, 97 S.Ct. 2861, 2870, 53 L.Ed.2d 982 (1977);  United States v. Connell, 960 F.2d 191, 196-97 (1st Cir.1992).  Though we take no view as to whether the concerns to which the district court alluded might warrant relief at the sentencing stage, see generally United States v. Saldana, 109 F.3d 100, 104 (1st Cir.1997) (acknowledging the possibility that the timing of an indictment might, in some circumstances, \"produce[ ] sentencing consequences so unusual and unfair that a departure would be permissible\"), those concerns are properly reserved for consideration at the time of sentencing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  They have no bearing on the question of whether a trial should go forward.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The anatomy of the doctrine of preindictment delay strengthens our conviction that Judge Harrington prematurely considered post-conviction possibilities.  Dismissal for preindictment delay on due process grounds requires, inter alia, a showing of actual prejudice.  See United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 325-26, 92 S.Ct. 455, 465-66, 30 L.Ed.2d 468 (1971);  Acha v. United States, 910 F.2d 28, 32 (1st Cir.1990) (per curiam).  Accordingly, courts regularly have found claims of prejudice related to sentencing possibilities too speculative to implicate a defendant's due process right.  See, e.g., United States v. Martinez, 77 F.3d 332, 336 (9th Cir.1996) (rebuffing the defendant's pretrial claim of prejudice from the effects of preindictment delay on his likely sentence because the guidelines provided leeway for departures);  United States v. McCoy, 977 F.2d 706, 711 (1st Cir.1992) (rejecting as conjectural the argument that preindictment delay reduced the defendant's opportunity to serve concurrent terms on state and federal charges).  So it is here:  whether Stokes' case ultimately will reach the sentencing stage, and if so, what sentence will be imposed, are questions reserved for an uncertain future.  By premising his analysis of the indictment's trialworthiness on the constitutional implications of a life sentence not yet imposed (and, perhaps, never to be imposed), Judge Harrington jumped the gun by several paces.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To recapitulate, sentencing issues are properly addressed during the sentencing phase of federal criminal trials.  The district court's flagrant contradiction of this tenet constituted legal error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>C. Miscellaneous Grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stokes attempts to confess and avoid.  If the district court erred in its reasoning, he says, its result nevertheless is defensible as a condign remedy for prosecutorial vindictiveness, or as a concinnous exercise of the court's supervisory powers, or because the district court erred when it failed to dismiss the indictment on the basis of preindictment delay.  We weigh each asseveration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Prosecutorial Vindictiveness.   It is hornbook law that a federal court may dismiss an indictment if the accused produces evidence of actual prosecutorial vindictiveness sufficient to establish a due process violation, or even if he demonstrates a likelihood of vindictiveness sufficient to justify a presumption.  See United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 376, 380 n. 12, 102 S.Ct. 2485, 2492 n. 12, 73 L.Ed.2d 74 (1982);  United States v. Marrapese, 826 F.2d 145, 147 (1st Cir.1987).  Seizing on a singular reference in the closing paragraph of Judge Harrington's opinion,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Stokes urges us to uphold the court's \"finding\" that prosecutorial vindictiveness occurred here.  In mounting this challenge, Stokes eschews a claim of actual vindictiveness, arguing instead that a presumption of vindictiveness arises from the government's admission that it would not have prosecuted Stokes federally had he been convicted of murder (and, therefore, given a substantially longer sentence) in the state court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin this segment of our analysis with a caveat:  courts should go very slowly in embracing presumptions of prosecutorial vindictiveness in pretrial proceedings.  See Goodwin, 457 U.S. at 381, 102 S.Ct. at 2492.   Here, moreover, the allegation of vindictiveness is not only oddly timed, but also oddly configured.  The sovereign is not alleged to have retaliated, as in the typical case, because an accused, embroiled in a legal battle with it, asserted a legal right.  See, e.g., Blackledge v. Perry, 417 U.S. 21, 28-29, 94 S.Ct. 2098, 2102-03, 40 L.Ed.2d 628 (1974);  North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 724-25, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 2079-80, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969).  Rather, the federal government is alleged to be acting vindictively in retaliation for an accused's victory in a state case.  Since it is well settled that \"the conduct of two independent sovereigns does not lend itself to the concept of vindictive prosecution,\" United States v. Bassford, 812 F.2d 16, 20 (1st Cir.1987) (quoting United States v. Ng, 699 F.2d 63, 68 (2d Cir.1983)), this is a difficult sale to make.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The level of difficulty increases due to the breadth of the prosecutor's discretion.  A federal prosecutor does not have the resources (time, money, staff) to charge every suspected malefactor.  In picking and choosing, the prosecutor must act in a fair and even-handed manner, and he is constrained by a set of rules and conventions (both legal and ethical).  But prosecutors are not required to function as bloodless automatons:  they may (indeed, they should) make judgments about dangerousness, set priorities, and give heightened attention to cases which inspire a sense of outrage.  This case illustrates the point:  the government's decision to refrain from initiating federal criminal proceedings pending the outcome of a parallel (but independent) state prosecution, and to relax the self-imposed restraint only after it had been disappointed by the end result of the parallel proceeding, falls squarely within the encincture of this prosecutorial discretion.  See United States v. Fuzer, 18 F.3d 517, 520 (7th Cir.1994);  Ng, 699 F.2d at 68-69.   The record indicates that Stokes is a dangerous criminal, and the federal government had a perfect right to take a hard look at his case and to determine whether society's interests call for the unusual step of instituting a federal prosecution notwithstanding the prior commencement of a state prosecution for substantially the same conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not wax longiloquent.  Simply put, the district court's inscrutable reference to vindictiveness fails to compensate for the utter absence of any circumstances from which a trier legitimately could presume vindictiveness.  See United States v. Sutherland, 929 F.2d 765, 772 n. 2 (1st Cir.1991) (noting that conclusory allegations are insufficient when the record lacks any competent evidence of vindictiveness).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Supervisory Powers.   The dismissal is equally vulnerable if viewed as an exercise of the district court's supervisory powers.  Such powers enable courts, within limits, to formulate procedural rules not specifically contemplated by the Constitution or codified in positive law.  See United States v. Hasting, 461 U.S. 499, 505, 103 S.Ct. 1974, 1978, 76 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983).  Thus, courts may invoke their supervisory powers to implement a remedy for violation of recognized rights, to preserve judicial integrity, or to deter illegal conduct.  See id.;   see also United States v. Horn, 29 F.3d 754, 760 (1st Cir.1994).  Even so, courts must use these powers \"sparingly.\"  United States v. Santana, 6 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not explicitly invoke its supervisory powers, but it did voice lingering concerns about \"fundamental fairness\" and \"fair play.\"  United States v. Stokes, 947 F.Supp. at 557.   Stokes reads these references as reflecting the court's belief that the government somehow abused its prosecutorial discretion in lodging the indictment and thus denied Stokes substantive due process.  The facts do not bear out this theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although dismissing an indictment on substantive due process grounds is not unprecedented, it is extremely rare.  Such a drastic step is reserved for cases of \"serious and blatant prosecutorial misconduct that distorts the integrity of the judicial process.\"  United States v. Giorgi, 840 F.2d 1022, 1030 (1st Cir.1988) (citation omitted).  The instant case does not present a suitable occasion for dismissing an indictment in order to vindicate the court's supervisory authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this vein, Stokes' flagship case, United States v. Rodman, 519 F.2d 1058 (1st Cir.1975) (per curiam), gains him little headway.  There, we upheld the trial court's use of inherent power to dismiss charges after the government breached a promise to recommend against indictment in return for information which included self-incriminating statements.  See id. at 1059-60.  Rodman illustrates the sort of egregious circumstances which are essential before a court appropriately may unleash its supervisory powers to interfere with the exercise of prosecutorial discretion.  The case at bar--in which the government had the discretion to initiate a federal prosecution and punctiliously followed applicable internal procedures in doing so--is not of that genre.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We give short shrift to Stokes' related allegation that the indictment was subject to dismissal because of prosecutorial abuse of sentence enhancers.  A pretrial dismissal on this basis constitutes a totally inappropriate use of the court's supervisory powers.  See supra Part II(B);  see also Horn, 29 F.3d at 760 (warning that courts may not employ their inherent powers to justify extreme remedies when \"satisfactory anodyne[s]\" exist which are \"more narrowly tailored to the objective\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, to the extent that Judge Harrington was influenced in his ruling by his evident personal disagreement with the government's decision to prosecute Stokes under federal law, his action was inappropriate.  It is a bedrock principle of our system of criminal justice that \"the Due Process Clause does not permit courts to abort criminal prosecutions simply because they disagree with a prosecutor's judgment as to when to seek an indictment.\"  United States v. Lovasco, 431 U.S. 783, 790, 97 S.Ct. 2044, 2048, 52 L.Ed.2d 752 (1977);  accord Santana, 6 F.3d at 11 (reading Supreme Court precedent as \"admonishing federal courts to refrain from using the supervisory power to conform executive conduct to judicially preferred norms by dismissing charges\" without sufficient legal cause).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the record contains no inkling of prosecutorial misconduct, vindictiveness, or other conduct antithetic to substantive due process which could justify dismissing the indictment through the exercise of the court's supervisory powers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Preindictment Delay.   Stokes' renewed claim of unconstitutional preindictment delay lacks substance.  A criminal defendant who asserts such a claim bears the heavy burden of showing not only that the preindictment delay caused him actual, substantial prejudice, but also that the prosecution orchestrated the delay to gain a tactical advantage over him.  See Marion, 404 U.S. at 324, 92 S.Ct. at 465;  United States v. Henson, 945 F.2d 430, 439 (1st Cir.1991).  The appellee shows neither.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stokes argues that he satisfied the first prong of the test because, had the federal government promptly indicted him, he would have continued searching for a potential defense witness, Sherry Parkman, who disappeared between the date of the offense and the date of the state court trial.  Since the appellee was unable to locate the witness at the time of his state trial, there is no credible reason to believe that the delay on the federal side placed him in a position less advantageous than he would have occupied had the indictments been contemporaneous.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellee's fallback position is that the delay prejudiced him by denying him the benefit of running his state and federal sentences concurrently.  This is pure speculation and, hence, inadequate to the task.  See McCoy, 977 F.2d at 711.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the expense of carting coal to Newcastle, we add that Stokes also fails on the second prong of the test.  By all accounts, the government temporized until it knew the result of the state court prosecution.  Even then, the government deferred an indictment because it gave priority to the prosecution of offenders who, unlike Stokes, were not already in custody.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's explanation is plausible and unimpeached;  it should, therefore, be accepted.  See United States v. Marler, 756 F.2d 206, 215 n. 6 (1st Cir.1985).  It indicates that the government acted out of proper motives and achieved no undue tactical advantage.  For these reasons, Stokes fails to persuade us that the district court erred in refusing to dismiss the case based on inordinate preindictment delay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  It is evident to us that the district court erred as a matter of law in dismissing the case prior to trial.  Having obtained a valid indictment within the limitations period, the government is entitled to try the defendant on the merits.  Moreover, we think it best that the case be transferred to a new trier on remand, and we so direct.  See, e.g, United States v. Muniz, 49 F.3d 36, 42-43 (1st Cir.1995);  Cia.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The factual foundation of the case is laid elsewhere, see United States v. Stokes, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">947</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">546</span></span> (D.Mass.1996);  Commonwealth v.

On August 11, 1992, a state court jury acquitted him on the murder charge, but convicted him on the other three counts.  Mindful of both the circumstances of the crimes and the defendant's recidivism, the judge sentenced him at or near the statutory maximum for each count and made the sentences consecutive.  Stokes' anticipated release date from state confinement is in 2006.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The federal government knew of Stokes' case no later than June 9, 1993.  Still, the federal behemoth did not stir until December 5, 1995, when the United States charged Stokes with being a felon in possession of a firearm.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1) (1994).  Stokes moved to dismiss the federal indictment on temporally oriented grounds.  He averred that the prosecution was time-barred and that the protracted preindictment delay violated (a) his Fifth Amendment right to due process, (b) his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial, and (c) the strictures of Fed.R.Crim.P. 48(b).  Following a hearing, the district court took the unorthodox step of submitting a series of interrogatories to the government sua sponte.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the course of those proceedings, the government explained, among other things, that this prosecution would further the federal interest in protecting the public from a violent criminal.  The government noted that Stokes, who had accumulated an unrelieved record of bellicose criminality, on this occasion had wielded a particularly lethal weapon, and that, if he were to be convicted on the federal charge, he could be punished as an armed career criminal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The court eventually rejected each of Stokes' claims.  Because the five-year statute of limitations commenced running on December 7, 1990, the indictment, handed up on December 5, 1995, was timely.  See United States v. Stokes, 947 F.Supp. at 550.   Because the defendant made no showing that preindictment delay caused him actual prejudice or emanated from a prosecution effort to gain an unfair tactical advantage, Stokes' Fifth Amendment claim failed.  See id. at 551.   Because an accused's constitutional right to a speedy trial does not attach until the filing of a charge, the Sixth Amendment offered Stokes no shelter.  See id. at 552.   And, finally, the court ruled that Criminal Rule 48(b) does not apply to preindictment delay.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had the district court stopped at this juncture, these proceedings would be unnecessary.  But the judge brooded over the sentencing possibilities.  Noting that, regardless of the earlier acquittal, Stokes' sentence could be enhanced to life imprisonment without parole if the government obtained a conviction on the federal weapons charge and then proved at sentencing by a preponderance of the evidence that he had committed the murder, see generally USSG &#167; 2K2.1;  USSG &#167; 1B1.3(a), the judge foresaw \"vexing issues\" of due process, double jeopardy, and selective prosecution.  United States v. Stokes, 947 F.Supp. at 553.   While acknowledging that the prosecution transgressed no established constitutional doctrine, he identified four factors which, in his estimation, gave rise to \"constitutional implications\":  (1) the substantial preindictment delay;  (2) a de facto successive prosecution for the same firearms offense, albeit by a different sovereign, exacerbated by the prospect of a disparate sentence of mandatory life imprisonment;  (3) a de facto reprosecution, in the guise of a sentencing enhancement, for acquitted conduct (the murder) under a less rigorous standard of proof;  and (4) a form of selective prosecution.  Id. at 556-57.   He then proceeded to dismiss the indictment, reasoning that \"[a]lthough no one factor, by itself, may offend constitutional canons, the effect of all of the factors in the aggregate ... violates the Due Process Clause.\"  Id. at 557.   This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the district court's dismissal of the indictment on constitutional grounds raises a pure question of law, we exercise plenary review.

We begin with the court's aggregation theory and then turn to the court's preoccupation with possible sentencing outcomes.

Aggregate Effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cornerstone of the district court's order is its conclusion that a medley of constitutional concerns, each insufficient to bar prosecution, added up to a due process violation and required dismissal of the indictment.  The district court cited United States v. Lombard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196476\"><a href=\"/opinion/196476/united-states-v-lombard/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">170</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1995) (Lombard I), as the sole authority for this aggregation theory.  Lombard I is well wide of the mark.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A state court jury acquitted Lombard on murder charges.  A federal court jury subsequently convicted him on federal firearms charges arising out the same nucleus of operative facts.  The trial judge imposed a mandatory life sentence based on preponderant evidence that Lombard used the weapons to commit the murders (of which he previously had been acquitted).  See id. at 172.   Expressing but not resolving constitutional concerns about, inter alia, the magnitude of the sentence enhancement, the prior acquittal, the qualitative difference between the sentence-enhancing conduct and the offense of conviction, and the severity of the sentence imposed, the court held that this combination of special facts permitted the district court to consider a downward departure at sentencing.  See id. at 180, 184-85;  see also United States v. Lombard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197116\"><a href=\"/opinion/197116/united-states-v-lombard-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2 (1st Cir.1996) (Lombard II) (explicating previous panel decision), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Lombard I is a sentencing case, elaborating on departure principles, and its analysis is unique to the milieu of the federal sentencing guidelines.  See Lombard I, 72 F.3d at 183-87;  see generally Koon v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118044\"><a href=\"/opinion/118044/koon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">392</span></a></span> (1996).  Judge Harrington transposed the statements contained in Lombard I from the sentencing context to the pretrial context.  Tugging those statements so far from their moorings empties them of meaning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Judge Harrington's reading of Lombard I is undone by Lombard II (which, in all fairness, was decided some two weeks after Judge Harrington ruled).  Lombard I resulted in a remand for further consideration of the appropriate sentence.  72 F.3d at 187.  Lombard II upheld the district court's denial of a downward departure and its reimposition of a sentence of life imprisonment.  102 F.3d at 2-3, 5. This result refutes Judge Harrington's vision of Lombard I as the progenitor of a new constitutional dogma.  The short of it is that the district court did not cite, and we have not unearthed, any authority for the proposition that individual factors, none of which crosses constitutional boundaries, may violate the Constitution in the aggregate.  While perhaps some strange concatenation of circumstances lurks at the outer periphery of constitutional doctrine, we are confident that, on the facts of this case, the whole is no more than the sum of the parts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a gallant effort to hold his gains, Stokes' able counsel points out that we have recognized in other contexts the principle of cumulative effect.  See, e.g., United States v. Sepulveda, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662432\"><a href=\"/opinion/662432/united-states-v-david-sepulveda-united-states-of-america-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span>, 1195-96 (1st Cir.1993);  United States v.

That is true as far as it goes--but it does not go very far.  While trial errors which in isolation appear harmless may have a cumulative effect so prejudicial as to require reversal, the operation of that principle depends on the existence of two or more errors.  By definition, cumulative-error analysis is inappropriate when a party complains of the cumulative effect of non-errors.  See Hoxsie v. Kerby, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"737507\"><a href=\"/opinion/737507/gary-randall-hoxsie-v-dareld-kerby-warden-tom-udall-attorney-general-for/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1239</span></a></span>, 1245 (10th Cir.1997), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></span>, --- L.Ed.2d ---- (1997).  Here, as Judge Harrington himself concluded, each individual claim of constitutional error misfires.  Thus, we cannot endorse the curious alchemy by which the lower court transformed an array of constitutionally acceptable factors into a constitutional abomination.B. Sentencing Considerations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court below dwelt at some length on the potentially severe sentence that Stokes might receive if he were convicted on the federal charge.  The court's reliance on this factor as a basis for granting relief was at best premature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the normal course of events, a facially valid indictment returned by a duly constituted grand jury calls for a trial on the merits.  See Costello v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105355\"><a href=\"/opinion/105355/costello-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">350</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">359</span></a></span>, 363, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105355\"><a href=\"/opinion/105355/costello-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Because the public maintains an abiding interest in the administration of criminal justice, dismissing an indictment is an extraordinary step.  See United States v. Morrison, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110372\"><a href=\"/opinion/110372/united-states-v-morrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">361</span></a></span>, 363-64, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110372\"><a href=\"/opinion/110372/united-states-v-morrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Even when evidence of a constitutional infraction looms, remedies ordinarily \"should be tailored to the injury suffered from the constitutional violation and should not unnecessarily infringe on competing interests.\"  Id. at 364, 101 S.Ct. at 667.   Thus, an indictment should not be dismissed with prejudice when other means exist to correct a constitutional breach.  See id. at 365, 101 S.Ct. at 668;  cf.  United States v. Hastings, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"506587\"><a href=\"/opinion/506587/united-states-v-kenneth-s-hastings/\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">920</span></a></span>, 928-29 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This principle applies in regard to sentencing:  when the supposed constitutional infirmity derives from particular attributes of a sentence imposed, the scope of relief is limited to excising the taint from the sentence.

Seizing on a singular reference in the closing paragraph of Judge Harrington's opinion,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Stokes urges us to uphold the court's \"finding\" that prosecutorial vindictiveness occurred here.  In mounting this challenge, Stokes eschews a claim of actual vindictiveness, arguing instead that a presumption of vindictiveness arises from the government's admission that it would not have prosecuted Stokes federally had he been convicted of murder (and, therefore, given a substantially longer sentence) in the state court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin this segment of our analysis with a caveat:  courts should go very slowly in embracing presumptions of prosecutorial vindictiveness in pretrial proceedings.  See Goodwin, 457 U.S. at 381, 102 S.Ct. at 2492.   Here, moreover, the allegation of vindictiveness is not only oddly timed, but also oddly configured.  The sovereign is not alleged to have retaliated, as in the typical case, because an accused, embroiled in a legal battle with it, asserted a legal right.  See, e.g., Blackledge v.

A federal prosecutor does not have the resources (time, money, staff) to charge every suspected malefactor.  In picking and choosing, the prosecutor must act in a fair and even-handed manner, and he is constrained by a set of rules and conventions (both legal and ethical).  But prosecutors are not required to function as bloodless automatons:  they may (indeed, they should) make judgments about dangerousness, set priorities, and give heightened attention to cases which inspire a sense of outrage.  This case illustrates the point:  the government's decision to refrain from initiating federal criminal proceedings pending the outcome of a parallel (but independent) state prosecution, and to relax the self-imposed restraint only after it had been disappointed by the end result of the parallel proceeding, falls squarely within the encincture of this prosecutorial discretion.  See United States v. Fuzer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"664697\"><a href=\"/opinion/664697/united-states-v-frank-fuzer/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></a></span>, 520 (7th Cir.1994);  Ng, 699 F.2d at 68-69.   The record indicates that Stokes is a dangerous criminal, and the federal government had a perfect right to take a hard look at his case and to determine whether society's interests call for the unusual step of instituting a federal prosecution notwithstanding the prior commencement of a state prosecution for substantially the same conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not wax longiloquent.  Simply put, the district court's inscrutable reference to vindictiveness fails to compensate for the utter absence of any circumstances from which a trier legitimately could presume vindictiveness.  See United States v. Sutherland, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"558565\"><a href=\"/opinion/558565/united-states-v-dianne-sutherland-united-states-of-america-v-alan-w/\"><span class=\"volume\">929</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span>, 772 n. 2 (1st Cir.1991) (noting that conclusory allegations are insufficient when the record lacks any competent evidence of vindictiveness).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Supervisory Powers.   The dismissal is equally vulnerable if viewed as an exercise of the district court's supervisory powers.  Such powers enable courts, within limits, to formulate procedural rules not specifically contemplated by the Constitution or codified in positive law.  See United States v. Hasting, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110933\"><a href=\"/opinion/110933/united-states-v-hasting/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span>, 505, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110933\"><a href=\"/opinion/110933/united-states-v-hasting/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

There, we upheld the trial court's use of inherent power to dismiss charges after the government breached a promise to recommend against indictment in return for information which included self-incriminating statements.  See id. at 1059-60.  Rodman illustrates the sort of egregious circumstances which are essential before a court appropriately may unleash its supervisory powers to interfere with the exercise of prosecutorial discretion.  The case at bar--in which the government had the discretion to initiate a federal prosecution and punctiliously followed applicable internal procedures in doing so--is not of that genre.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We give short shrift to Stokes' related allegation that the indictment was subject to dismissal because of prosecutorial abuse of sentence enhancers.  A pretrial dismissal on this basis constitutes a totally inappropriate use of the court's supervisory powers.  See supra Part II(B);  see also Horn, 29 F.3d at 760 (warning that courts may not employ their inherent powers to justify extreme remedies when \"satisfactory anodyne[s]\" exist which are \"more narrowly tailored to the objective\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, to the extent that Judge Harrington was influenced in his ruling by his evident personal disagreement with the government's decision to prosecute Stokes under federal law, his action was inappropriate.

Preindictment Delay.   Stokes' renewed claim of unconstitutional preindictment delay lacks substance.  A criminal defendant who asserts such a claim bears the heavy burden of showing not only that the preindictment delay caused him actual, substantial prejudice, but also that the prosecution orchestrated the delay to gain a tactical advantage over him.  See Marion, 404 U.S. at 324, 92 S.Ct. at 465;  United States v.

Since the appellee was unable to locate the witness at the time of his state trial, there is no credible reason to believe that the delay on the federal side placed him in a position less advantageous than he would have occupied had the indictments been contemporaneous.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellee's fallback position is that the delay prejudiced him by denying him the benefit of running his state and federal sentences concurrently.

By all accounts, the government temporized until it knew the result of the state court prosecution.  Even then, the government deferred an indictment because it gave priority to the prosecution of offenders who, unlike Stokes, were not already in custody.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's explanation is plausible and unimpeached;  it should, therefore, be accepted.

It indicates that the government acted out of proper motives and achieved no undue tactical advantage.  For these reasons, Stokes fails to persuade us that the district court erred in refusing to dismiss the case based on inordinate preindictment delay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

See Bassford, 812 F.2d at 20-21;  Ng, 699 F.2d at 68.   There is no basis for such a finding here</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> In all events Parkman's statements are ambiguous.  See Commonwealth v. Stokes, 653 N.E.2d at 185.   Because proof of actual prejudice must be definite and not speculative, see Acha, 910 F.2d at 32, this fact, without more, would sink the appellee's argument</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
