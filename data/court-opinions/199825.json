This set of appeals grows out of\n\nan    indictment   alleging    that     the   appellants,      along    with   76\n\nothers, were part of a sprawling drug smuggling and distribution\n\nnetwork in southwest Puerto Rico between 1994 and 1997.                        The\n\ntwo-count indictment charged Angela Ayala-Martinez (\"Ayala\") and\n\nManuel Perez-Colon (\"Perez\") with conspiracy to possess and\n\ndistribute    multi-kilogram       amounts      of   cocaine,     heroin,      and\n\nmarijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and 846 (1994)\n\nand   conspiracy   to     engage   in    illegal     financial    transactions\n\ninvolving    the   drug    proceeds      in   violation   of     18   U.S.C.    §§\n\n1956(a)(1) and 1957 (1994).             Perez's money laundering charge\n\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 1957, but not § 1956(a)(1), was later dropped.\n\nAppellant Marcos Martinez-Medina (\"Martinez\") was charged only\n\nwith participating in the drug conspiracy.\n\n            The three appellants were tried along with four other\n\nco-defendants:     Manuel    Garcia-Torres       (\"Manuel\"),      his   brother\n\nAndres Garcia-Torres (\"Andres\"), Walter Batiz, and Deri Ventura.\n\nThe evidence presented during the forty-day trial was extensive,1\n\nand featured the testimony of several indicted co-conspirators\n\n\n\n\n       1\n     The evidence presented at trial was far more extensive and\ntherefore differed in some respects from the evidence presented\nin the case against Jaime Garcia-Torres, who was tried\nseparately for related offenses. See United States v. Garcia-\nTorres, ___ F.3d ___ (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n                                        -3-\n\fwho agreed to cooperate with the government in exchange for\n\nleniency.\n\n            In brief, it showed that in 1995, Ayala obtained a\n\ncontact with a Colombian dealer, Jorge Alicea-Serrano (a/k/a\n\n\"Jockey\"), to import large quantities of cocaine into Puerto\n\nRico.   The drugs were delivered by air and by sea, and Ayala\n\nhired   others--including   Andres    Garcia,   Perez,   Batiz,   and\n\nVentura--to retrieve them for her.\n\n            By virtue of her connection to Jockey, Ayala rose from\n\na small-time drug dealer to a major supplier to various drug\n\ndistribution points at housing projects in the city of Ponce.\n\nAmong them were drug points at Los Lirios Del Sur and Santiago\n\nIglesias, owned by Perez; La Atocha and Tibes, owned by Edwin\n\nMelendez Negron (a/k/a \"Danny Gongolon\"); and La Cantera, owned\n\nby the Garcias' older brother Tommy Garcia-Torres until his\n\ndeath in August 1995, when it was inherited by Manuel Garcia and\n\nVentura.    Batiz worked for Garcia and Ventura cutting drugs at\n\nLa Cantera.\n\n            Disputes at these drug points led to several violent\n\nkillings, which were not charged as crimes but were important to\n\nthe government's case both as conspiratorial acts and factors in\n\nsentencing.    According to the testimony of a cooperating witness\n\nnamed Daniel Sanchez-Ortiz, in or around 1996 Perez ordered the\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fmurder of Sol Garcia, owner of a competing drug point at Los\n\nLirios del Sur that was threatening Perez's sales.\n\n            At La Cantera, an internecine feud erupted in 1994 when\n\nTommy Garcia fired \"Gerardito\", his brother-in-law and drug\n\nrunner, because he allegedly stole $35,000 to $40,000 in drug\n\nproceeds.    After being ostracized from La Cantera, Gerardito and\n\nhis brother Nelsito began associating with Michael Vazquez and\n\nhis father Eddie; the Vazquezes owned a jewelry store and had no\n\ndemonstrated connection to the drug trade but had weapons and\n\nwere willing to help Gerardito seek revenge against the Garcias.\n\nA   war   soon    erupted   between   the   Garcias    and   their   allies--\n\nincluding Ventura, Ayala, and Gongolon--and Gerardito and his\n\nfaction--which       included    Nelsito,     the     Vazquezes,     and   the\n\nVazquezes' jewelry store employee, Jose Negron-Santiago (a/k/a\n\n\"Bejumen\").\n\n            A series of violent incidents ensued between the two\n\nfactions.        In 1995 Tommy Garcia and his trigger man, Abraham\n\nBorgos Santiago, were killed in separate incidents, as was\n\n\"Gordo\", a friend of Gerardito and Nelsito.               Each side pinned\n\nblame on the other.         In 1996, Eddie Vazquez shot and wounded\n\nDanny Gongolon.       On numerous occasions throughout this period,\n\nthe Garcias tried to find and kill Gerardito, Nelsito, the\n\nVazquezes, and Bejumen.\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f         On February 14, 1997, Bejumen and his wife Rosemarie\n\nwere shot and killed in their car.    Gamaliel Goglas-Valentin,\n\nwho worked part time for the Garcias at La Cantera and also\n\nhelped them store guns, testified that Andres, Manuel, and\n\nMarcos Martinez drove into the auto shop where he was working\n\nand celebrated openly that they had \"finally\" killed Bejumen.\n\nAs Andres described it, the three of them ambushed Bejumen's\n\ncar; Martinez and Andres then opened the door and shot Bejumen\n\nand his wife repeatedly at close range.\n\n         Four days later, Ayala, Manuel, Danny Gongolon, and\n\nVentura paid $20,000 to hire kidnappers to pose as policeman and\n\n\"arrest\" Michael Vazquez.     Although the testimony of various\n\nwitnesses is somewhat unclear as to the precise chain of events,\n\nit appears that the kidnappers handed Michael Vazquez over to\n\nassociates of the Garcia group--including Manuel and Andres\n\nGarcia, Gongolon, Ventura, and Batiz--who drove away with him\n\nand killed him.   They also found and shot Eddie Vazquez.   Ayala\n\nwas described as celebrating when she was told that the plan had\n\nbeen successfully executed.\n\n         The appellants were convicted as charged.    Ayala and\n\nPerez were sentenced to life imprisonment on the drug conspiracy\n\ncount and 20 years' imprisonment on the money laundering count,\n\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\fto be served concurrently; Martinez was sentenced to 405 months'\n\nimprisonment.    These appeals ensued.\n\n            The appellants' various claims can be grouped into\n\nseveral categories: sufficiency of the evidence as to certain\n\ncounts,     admissibility       of     specific     evidence,     alleged\n\nprosecutorial misconduct, improper jury instructions, sentencing\n\nrulings, and new trial claims based on new or withheld evidence.\n\nWe affirm the appellants' convictions and sentences in all\n\nrespects.\n\n                     I.   SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n            Single    versus   multiple      conspiracies.      All   three\n\nappellants argue that the evidence was insufficient to support\n\naspects of their convictions.              The first sufficiency issue,\n\nraised by Ayala and Perez, is the frequently raised but often\n\nmisunderstood claim that a single conspiracy found by the jury\n\nwas in fact multiple, independent conspiracies.2             If there was\n\nsuch \"variance\" between the indictment and the proof at trial,\n\nit might be grounds for reversal if it substantially prejudiced\n\nthe defendants' rights by, for example, allowing the jury to\n\ntransfer evidence of one conspiracy against defendants involved\n\n\n    2Because the defendants did not challenge the jury\ninstructions as to conspiracy, we review the issue for\nevidentiary sufficiency only. United States v. Mena-Robles, 4\nF.3d 1026, 1033 (1st Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1035\n(1994).\n\n                                     -7-\n\fin another.        Kotteakos v.         United States, 328 U.S. 750, 774\n\n(1946); United States v. Glenn, 828 F.2d 855, 858 (1st Cir.\n\n1987); see generally 4 LaFave, Israel & King, Criminal Procedure\n\n§ 19.6 (2d ed. 1999).\n\n            Appellants make two different so-called \"variance\"\n\narguments.      The first focuses on the possibility that some\n\npeople charged in the indictment but not tried together with the\n\ndefendants      might      not   have     been     implicated       in   the     same\n\nconspiracy--in       particular,         other    drug     point    owners       whose\n\nassociation     with    Ayala     and    the   Garcias     may    have   been     more\n\ntangential.     But the government need not show that every person\n\nindicted was a member of the conspiracy.                         United States v.\n\nTownsend,    924    F.2d    1385,   1389       (7th   Cir.   1991).         At   most,\n\nquestions may arise whether the introduction of evidence as to\n\nthese other individuals' actions was unfairly prejudicial to the\n\ndefendants.     United States v. Mojica, 185 F.3d 780, 785-86 (7th\n\nCir. 1999).     But the appellants make no sustained argument as to\n\nunfair prejudice.\n\n            Appellants' main \"variance\" claim is that not all of\n\nthose   tried      together      were    engaged      in   the     single    charged\n\nconspiracy.     This is essentially a challenge to the sufficiency\n\nof the evidence.            Townsend, 924 F.2d at 1389.                  As in all\n\nsufficiency claims, we take the evidence, including issues of\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fcredibility, in the light most favorable to the government and\n\nask whether a rational jury could easily find guilt beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.   United States v. Moran, 984 F.2d 1299, 1300\n\n(1st Cir. 1993).\n\n          The touchstone of conspiracy is an agreement to do an\n\nunlawful act,   Iannelli v.    United States, 420 U.S. 770, 777\n\n(1975), but each coconspirator need not know of or have contact\n\nwith all other members, nor must they know all of the details of\n\nthe conspiracy or participate in every act in furtherance of it.3\n\nThe jury may infer an agreement circumstantially by evidence of,\n\ninter alia, a common purpose (such as a purpose to sell illicit\n\ndrugs), overlap of participants, and interdependence of various\n\nelements in the overall plan.4\n\n          Putting aside Martinez (who raises a separate claim\n\nthat we address below), the evidence permitted the jury to find\n\nthat the appellants and their co-defendants were engaged in a\n\nsingle drug conspiracy.       The Garcias, Ventura, and Batiz all\n\n\n     3\n     United States v. Garcia-Rosa, 876 F.2d 209, 223 (1st Cir.\n1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1030, vacated on other grounds sub\nnom. Rivera-Feliciano v. United States, 498 U.S. 954 (1990);\nUnited States v. Giry, 818 F.2d 120, 127 (1st Cir.), cert.\ndenied, 484 U.S. 855 (1987); United States v. Drougas, 748 F.2d\n8, 17 (1st Cir. 1984).\n     4\n     See United States v. Rivera-Ruiz, 244 F.3d 263, 268 (1st\nCir. 2001); United States v. Randazzo, 80 F.3d 623, 629 (1st\nCir. 1996); see also 2 LaFave & Scott, Substantive Criminal Law\n§ 6.4(d) (1986).\n\n                                 -9-\n\fengaged in a joint venture--the La Cantera drug point--whose\n\nmain supplier was Ayala.        Ayala supplied the drugs and profited\n\nfrom their resale, while the Garcias, Ventura, and Batiz ran the\n\nresale operation and took steps--often violent--to protect it.\n\nThis   ongoing     operation     could       be     found       to     constitute      a\n\nconspiracy.     See United States v. Ortiz De Jesus, 230 F.3d 1, 5\n\n(1st Cir. 2000).\n\n          Perez was not involved in the operations of the La\n\nCantera drug point but instead operated his own drug points at\n\nLos Lirios del Sur and Santiago Iglesias.                   Were this Perez's\n\nonly connection to Ayala, it might be arguable that Perez was\n\nnot part of the same conspiracy as the La Cantera operators.                          In\n\na case where a common supplier is the sole link between diverse\n\ndistributors, it may be more difficult to sustain a finding of\n\ncommon agreement,       see, e.g., Kotteakos, 328 U.S. at 754-56;\n\nGlenn, 828 F.2d at 858, although even then one could be inferred\n\nby   additional    evidence--e.g.,       a     finding      that           the   various\n\ndistributors depended on one another for the health of their own\n\ndrug business, see United States v. Portela, 167 F.3d 687, 697\n\n(1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          In     this   case,   not   only        was   Perez        one    of   Ayala's\n\ndistributors,     but   he   directly        aided      Ayala    by        helping   her\n\nretrieve the drugs from Jockey, Ayala's aforementioned Colombian\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fcontact.   From there, Perez distributed the drugs to the drug\n\npoints per Ayala's instructions.      This evidence is more than\n\nsufficient to show that Perez was in a single conspiracy with\n\nAyala and the La Cantera operators to distribute narcotics.\n\n           Evidence as to Martinez.   Martinez argues separately\n\nthat even if the other co-defendants were part of a single drug\n\nconspiracy, he was not part of it.    Martinez paints himself as\n\na \"hired gun\" who participated in the murder of Bejumen Santiago\n\nat the behest of the Garcias but did not share or even know of\n\ntheir purpose to promote the drug operations.\n\n           There is evidence that Martinez was directly involved\n\nin drug dealing.    Goglas testified that Martinez worked for\n\nJulio Teta, a friend of Manuel Garcia who was starting a new\n\ndrug point at Guanica.   Teta, usually accompanied by Martinez,\n\nwent to Goglas' house almost every day to pick up drugs from\n\nGarcia for the drug point.   Perhaps this evidence would suffice\n\nfor the jury to infer that through these repeated purchases of\n\ndrugs for resale, Martinez joined the Garcias' drug enterprise.\n\nSee United States v. Rivera-Ruiz, 244 F.3d 263, 270 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).\n\n           We need not decide this issue, however, because here\n\nthere is clearer evidence of agreement.       Sometime prior to\n\nFebruary 1997, Teta agreed to help Garcia in his conflict with\n\n\n                              -11-\n\fGerardito in exchange for help with some problems he was having\n\nat the Guanica drug point.                  The evidence that Martinez was\n\nregularly       involved      in   drug     dealing     with    Teta         provides      a\n\nreasonable basis for the jury to infer that he also knew about\n\nthe working arrangements between Teta and Garcia; this is the\n\nmost       straightforward     way    to    explain   how      he    came     to    assist\n\nGarcia, for whom he did not otherwise work, in carrying out the\n\nmurder of Bejumen--which (as will be seen) can be deemed a part\n\nof the larger conspiracy.\n\n               This    inference     is    reinforced    by     the      fact      that   on\n\nanother occasion Teta and Martinez unsuccessfully went out to\n\nfind and kill Nelsito and Gerardito using guns supplied by\n\nManuel Garcia.          Based on this evidence--Teta's pact with Manuel\n\nGarcia, Martinez's relationship with Teta, and Martinez's overt\n\nacts on behalf of Manuel Garcia--a jury could reasonably infer\n\nthat Martinez agreed to join the Garcias' drug operation in the\n\ncapacity of an enforcer.\n\n               Virtually all of the evidence linking Martinez to the\n\nconspiracy came in through the testimony of Goglas,5 and Martinez\n\nargues       that     the   uncorroborated        testimony         of   a   government\n\n\n       5\n     Danny Gongolon also testified that he had seen Martinez at\nAyala's house on several occasions (including a barbecue party)\nbefore the murder of Bejumen, but Gongolon's testimony provided\nno specific information about the substance of Martinez and\nAyala's relationship.\n\n                                           -12-\n\finformant is not enough to convict.         That argument runs contrary\n\nto the law of this circuit, which leaves in the hands of the\n\njury decisions about credibility of witnesses \"so long as the\n\ntestimony is not incredible or insubstantial on its face.\"\n\nUnited   States     v.   Andujar,   49   F.3d   16,   21   (1st   Cir.   1995)\n\n(quotations omitted).\n\n            Perez's money laundering conviction. Perez appeals the\n\ndenial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal on the money\n\nlaundering conspiracy count.         The government replies that Perez\n\nconspired    with    Ayala   to   engage   in   a   financial     transaction\n\ndesigned to conceal the unlawful proceeds in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i) (1994).          Specifically, the government\n\non appeal relies on an incident in which Ayala had her drug\n\npoint employee Hector Dominicci install air conditioning units\n\nin Perez's house.         Ayala paid Dominicci between $8,000 and\n\n$10,000 in cash, which she retrieved from the house of her\n\nfriend Maria Barbosa, who routinely hid drug money for her.\n\n            To prove a money laundering conspiracy under 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1956(a)(1)(B)(i), the government must show that Perez agreed\n\nto have the air conditioners installed knowing both that they\n\nwere paid for with illegal proceeds and that the transaction was\n\n\"designed, in whole or in part . . . to conceal or disguise the\n\nnature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fof the proceeds . . . .\"       Where the defendant is someone other\n\nthan the source of the illegal proceeds (here, Perez), the\n\nstatute is concerned with his knowledge of the source's intent\n\nin the transaction.      United States v. Campbell, 977 F.2d 854,\n\n857-58 (4th Cir. 1992); see also United States v. Frigerio-\n\nMigiano, 254 F.3d 30, 33 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n          Perez objects that there is no evidence that Ayala used\n\nthe air conditioners to conceal her drug money or that he knew\n\nof Ayala's intent.      Concededly there is no direct evidence of\n\nAyala's intent in this transaction.          But the evidence indicates\n\nat least two other transactions between Ayala and Dominicci that\n\nsupport an inference of pattern.           In 1995 Ayala gave Dominicci\n\n$30,000 in small bills and had him buy a Ford Explorer for her\n\nin the name of his air conditioning company.            She also paid him\n\nabout   $16,000   in   cash   for   a   Mazda   that   was   registered   to\n\nDominicci's sister. Dominicci used the money to pay off the\n\nbalance on the car; the registration was never changed after the\n\nsale.\n\n          Purchasing large items with drug money through third\n\nparties surely supports an inference of intent to conceal.                See\n\nUnited States v. Westbrook, 119 F.3d 1176, 1191 (5th Cir. 1997),\n\ncert. denied, 522 U.S. 1119 (1998); United States v. Cisneros,\n\n112 F.3d 1272, 1283 (5th Cir. 1997).             And Ayala's intent in\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fthese   automobile     purchases     could    fairly    justify     a    jury's\n\nconclusion that the air conditioners were also part of Ayala's\n\nconcerted effort to conceal the drug proceeds.\n\n           As to Perez's knowledge, he was intimately involved in\n\nAyala's drug operations, both helping Ayala retrieve the drugs\n\nfrom Jockey and helping distribute them to the drug points.                    He\n\nalso ran two drug points of his own.           Perez's deep involvement\n\nin Ayala's drug business is enough for a jury to find beyond a\n\nreasonable     doubt   that   when    Perez   agreed    to   have       the   air\n\nconditioners installed, he knew that Ayala was using them to\n\nconceal her drug money.\n\n                II.    ADMISSION OF SPECIFIC EVIDENCE\n\n           Evidence of the murders.           Appellants object to the\n\nadmission of specific pieces of evidence introduced at trial.\n\nMartinez argues that the evidence of the Bejumen and Vazquez\n\nmurders was unfairly prejudicial and irrelevant because they had\n\nno relationship to the drug conspiracy.          See Fed. R. Evid. 403;\n\nUnited States v. Gonsalves, 668 F.2d 73, 75 (1st Cir. 1982).\n\n           To the contrary, the Garcias sought to kill Bejumen\n\nbecause he was associated with Gerardito, who had allegedly\n\nstolen from the Garcias' drug point.             Bejumen was apparently\n\nneither involved in the drug trade nor took any particular\n\nactions   to   threaten   the   Garcias's     drug     interests;       but   the\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fevidence revealed a pattern of murders originating in the drug\n\nconspiracy,    directed         against    mere   friends    and   relatives       of\n\nrivals,   which     the    jury    could     find   were    to   discourage       and\n\nundermine such rivals.\n\n          There was even more evidence presented at trial linking\n\nthe Vazquez murders to the drug conspiracy.                  While Bejumen may\n\nhave   been   killed      for    purely    retributive      reasons,      there    is\n\nsubstantial evidence that the Vazquezes posed a more immediate\n\nthreat to Garcias's future interests at La Cantera.                     After the\n\nfeud between Gerardito and the Garcias erupted, Michael Vazquez\n\nbegan to shoot at Gongolon's drug point at La Atocha and the\n\nGarcias' drug point at La Cantera, which depressed drug sales.\n\nThe Garcias thus targeted the Vazquezes not only to get back at\n\nGerardito,    but    to    protect        the   profitability      of   the     drug\n\nconspiracy.    The admission of the murders was relevant and not\n\nunfairly prejudicial.\n\n          Co-conspirator           hearsay      statements.        Much    of     the\n\ngovernment's      proof    rested     on    hearsay   statements        that    were\n\nadmitted in evidence under the co-conspirator exception, which\n\nexempts from the hearsay rule statements \"by a coconspirator of\n\na party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\"\n\nFed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E).               The district court found at the\n\nclose of the evidence that the statements more likely than not\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fsatisfied the requirements of the rule.                   See United States v.\n\nPetrozziello, 548 F.2d 20, 23 (1st Cir. 1977); accord Bourjaily\n\nv. United States, 483 U.S. 171, 175 (1987).                    Ayala and Perez\n\nallege error as to eight particular statements on the ground\n\nthat they were not made \"in furtherance\" of the conspiracy.                    Our\n\nreview is for clear error.           United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d\n\n1161, 1180 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n            Although its rationale is sometimes deemed shaky, \"the\n\nco-conspirator exception to hearsay is of long standing and\n\nmakes a difficult-to-detect crime easier to prove.\"                         United\n\nStates v.       Goldberg, 105 F.3d 770, 775 (1st Cir. 1997).                    As\n\ndeveloped       by   the   courts,   the    \"in    furtherance\"     requirement\n\nprovides    a    limited    exception      for    \"idle    conversations     among\n\ncriminal partners,\" as well as for statements clearly intended\n\nto foil rather than facilitate the criminal enterprise.                          5\n\nWeinstein, Federal Evidence § 801.34[5] (2d ed. 2001).                 However,\n\na statement need not be necessary or even important to the\n\nconspiracy, or even made to a co-conspirator, as long as it can\n\nbe said to advance the goals of the conspiracy in some way.                    Id.\n\n            Six of the statements challenged by the appellants\n\neasily satisfy this requirement because they conveyed to other\n\nco-conspirators information about the operations of the drug\n\nconspiracy      centering     around    Ayala:     which    drug   points    Ayala\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\fsupplied,    the      means   by   which      she    retrieved      the     drugs   from\n\nJockey, and the role that Batiz played at La Cantera.                         Three of\n\nthe statements indicate that Ayala supplied drugs to Gongolon\n\nand    Antonio     Gonzalez-Vega;         two       others    are    about     Ayala's\n\nstatements concerning the retrieval of drugs from the ocean; the\n\nsixth concerns Batiz's status as an employee of Ventura at La\n\nCantera.        See    Sepulveda,    15       F.3d    at     1180-81      (sharing    of\n\ninformation about co-conspirators' roles and a conspiracy's mode\n\nof operation); United States v. Munson, 819 F.2d 337, 341 (1st\n\nCir.   1987)     (identification         of    co-conspirator          as   source   of\n\ncocaine).\n\n            The final two statements--admissions by \"Eleizer\" to\n\nGongolon and Goglas that he killed \"Joito El Orejon\"--are more\n\ndebatable.       Eleizer was Gongolon's bodyguard and worked at his\n\ndrug point at Tibes.          Gongolon testified that he told Eleizer he\n\nwas upset with Orejon for trying to sell a stolen car at Tibes,\n\nfearing    it    would   \"heat     up\"    the   drug       point.      When    Eleizer\n\nresponded that he wanted to kill Orejon, Gongolon advised him to\n\nwait until Orejon left Tibes.              After the killing, Eleizer told\n\nGongolon how the shooting occurred.                    On this version of the\n\nfacts, Eleizer's statements to Gongolon were undoubtedly in\n\nfurtherance of their drug conspiracy, since he and Gongolon were\n\n\n\n\n                                         -18-\n\fdiscussing strategies for dealing with the threat posed by\n\nOrejon to the Tibes drug point.\n\n              Goglas, however, testified that Ayala had Eleizer kill\n\nOrejon because Orejon had stolen some jewelry and money from\n\nAyala's friend Jose Velazquez.            This version of the facts is\n\nfriendlier to the appellants, since it makes the murder--and\n\nconsequently Eleizer's admission to it--less clearly relevant to\n\nthe drug conspiracy.         Although there is scant evidence as to\n\nwhich version of the facts is accurate (perhaps both are), we\n\ncannot say that the district court clearly erred in concluding\n\nthat    Eleizer's    admissions    were    more    likely   than    not   in\n\nfurtherance of the drug conspiracy.\n\n              Moreover, even if there was error in admitting these\n\nfinal   two    statements,   it   was   patently   harmless.       Here   the\n\nevidence as to the appellants' participation in the conspiracies\n\nwas strong, and it is highly improbable that the statements\n\nabout Eleizer's role in a murder that was at best peripheral to\n\nthe prosecution's case affected the verdict.            United States v.\n\nTse, 135 F.3d 200, 209-10 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n                      III.   PAYMENTS TO WITNESSES\n\n              Gamaliel Goglas, the main witness implicating Martinez\n\nin the conspiracy, was paid $9,000 in return for his cooperation\n\nin the government's case.         Goglas testified that he decided to\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\fcooperate with the government because he began to fear for his\n\nlife after he robbed $23,000 from Ventura and that the payments\n\nwere for his security while in Puerto Rico (hotel and travel\n\nexpenses) and for his relocation (a one-way ticket from Puerto\n\nRico).      DEA Agent Lugo corroborated this testimony, although he\n\nadmitted mistakenly indicating on a DEA form that the payment\n\nwas   for       \"information.\"       Angela    Castro,   another     cooperating\n\nwitness, was paid $10,000 for relocation expenses for her and\n\nher husband.\n\n                Martinez argues that these payments compromised the\n\nintegrity of his conviction and violated the federal witness\n\nbribery statute, 18 U.S.C. § 201(c)(2) (1994).                           As to the\n\nstatutory        issue,   it   is   entirely   doubtful    that     18    U.S.C.    §\n\n201(c)(2) applies at all to the government, see United States v.\n\nLara, 181 F.3d 183, 198 (1st Cir. 1999), but in all events\n\nCongress        has   explicitly    authorized    the    Attorney    General       to\n\nprovide for the relocation and protection of witnesses that may\n\nbe in danger, see 18 U.S.C. § 3521 (1994) (Witness Relocation\n\nand Protection Act).           It would be unreasonable to interpret 18\n\nU.S.C.      §    201(c)(2)     as   precluding    a   practice      specifically\n\nauthorized by a more specific and recent statute.                        See, e.g.,\n\nMorton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535, 550-51 (1974).\n\n\n\n\n                                       -20-\n\f             Certain      inducements    to   government    witnesses     may\n\ncompromise a defendant's fair trial right wholly apart from\n\nsection 201(c)(2).         United States v. Murphy, 193 F.3d 1, 9 (1st\n\nCir. 1999); see United States v. Dailey, 759 F.2d 192, 201 (1st\n\nCir. 1985).         But certainly security-related expenses are a\n\nlegitimate part of a prosecutor's arsenal, at least as long as\n\ncertain      procedural      safeguards--such    as   disclosure    of    the\n\narrangement to the parties and cautionary jury instructions--are\n\nmaintained.        See United States v. Innamorati, 996 F.2d 456, 482\n\n& n.11 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 955 (1993); United\n\nStates v.      Cresta, 825 F.2d 538, 546 (1st Cir. 1987), cert.\n\ndenied, 486 U.S. 1042 (1988).\n\n             Here the payments to Goglas were a relatively small\n\namount and, despite the apparent mistake in notation by the DEA\n\nagent,      designed   specifically     for   protection    and   relocation\n\nexpenses.      The defense cited such payments to argue bias to the\n\njury   as    its   main   defense   theory.     And   the   district     judge\n\ninstructed the jury that they should approach the testimony of\n\nthese witnesses \"with particular caution.\"            All of this lay well\n\nwithin constitutional bounds.           See United States v. Wilson, 904\n\nF.2d 656, 659-60 (11th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 889\n\n(1991).\n\n                       IV.    PROSECUTION'S SUMMATION\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\f          All three appellants allege that the trial was tainted\n\nby improper remarks by the prosecutor in summation.                    Some were\n\nobjected to; others were not.          Although several of the remarks\n\nwere highly improper, none calls for a new trial.\n\n          The   appellants     first        object   to   the    prosecutor's\n\nrepeated and graphic references to the various murders described\n\nat trial, claiming that this inflamed the passions of the jury\n\nand distracted from the merits of the case.                The trouble with\n\nthis theory is that, as discussed in Part II above, the murders\n\nwere a legitimate part of the government's case because they\n\nwere overt acts of the conspiracy.\n\n          At several points, the prosecution appealed to the\n\njuror's \"hearts and minds\" and \"conscience.\"                 The prosecutor\n\ntold the jury that \"your conscience must have been screaming at\n\nyou,   screaming   at   you   that    [the    defendants]       were   guilty.\"\n\nLater, the prosecutor said that \"if you know in your head and\n\nyour heart that these defendants are guilty then you must return\n\nthe only verdict that the evidence commands.\"                These comments\n\nwere plainly improper appeals to the jury's emotions and role as\n\nthe conscience of the community.        See Arrieta-Aggresot v. United\n\nStates, 3 F.3d 525, 527 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n          Nevertheless,       these     statements        were    immediately\n\nstricken, and when defense counsel later moved for a mistrial on\n\n\n                                     -22-\n\fthose grounds, the district court denied it and instructed the\n\njury that they were to use their common sense and experience,\n\nnot their emotions.    Improper though the prosecutor's statements\n\nwere, they are basically rhetoric rather than misstatements of\n\nevidence.     We also give weight to the judgment of the trial\n\njudge, who was better able to assess the impact of the remarks\n\non the jury, that they did not prejudice the outcome in light of\n\nthe curative instruction and overwhelming evidence.\n\n            More disturbing was the prosecutor's characterization\n\nof the defendants as \"hunting each other like animals\" and\n\nkilling one another \"with no mercy.\"             The reference to the\n\ndefendants as animals is especially inflammatory and improper.\n\nSee United States v. Hands, 184 F.3d 1322, 1332-33 (11th Cir.\n\n1999) (improper to refer to defendant as \"wickedly vicious man,\n\nmonster, drug dealer\").     Nevertheless, it is very difficult to\n\nbelieve that this single stray remark added anything significant\n\nto the depictions of the various murders by far more gruesome\n\ntestimony    and   photographs.     Thus,   it   seems   to   us   highly\n\nimplausible to think that this isolated epithet altered the\n\njury's verdict.\n\n            As to the various misstatements of fact alleged by the\n\nappellants, most appear reasonably supported by the record or\n\nare within the prerogative of the prosecution to characterize\n\n\n                                  -23-\n\fthe evidence presented at trial and argue certain inferences to\n\nthe jury.      United States v. Mount, 896 F.2d 612, 625 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).        Any    factual      inaccuracies    were   minor,   related      to\n\nperipheral issues, and had no plausible prejudicial effect.\n\n              The appellants claim that the prosecutor improperly\n\nvouched for witnesses' credibility on several occasions.                      The\n\nfirst statement--that the police returned certain seized money\n\nbecause they did not yet have Angela Castro's testimony to link\n\nit    to   Ayala--does      not   even    arguably   constitute   a    personal\n\nassurance as to Castro's credibility.\n\n              The second statement--that cooperating witnesses had\n\na motive to tell the truth because of the dire consequences of\n\nbreaking their plea agreements--was also not improper vouching\n\nbecause it provided a reason, not a personal assurance, why the\n\njury should believe the witnesses.               United States v. Auch, 187\n\nF.3d 125, 131 (1st Cir. 1999); see United States v. Rodriguez,\n\n215    F.3d   110,    123   (1st    Cir.   2000).     Moreover,   it    was    an\n\nappropriate response to the defense's main theory, which was\n\nthat the cooperating witnesses were lying to obtain leniency.\n\nSee United States v. Mejia-Lozano, 829 F.2d 268, 274 (1st Cir.\n\n1987); see also        United States v. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 12-13\n\n(1985).\n\n\n\n\n                                         -24-\n\f          A final set of statements were clearly improper.             In\n\nits rebuttal, the government sought to support the credibility\n\nof four cooperating witnesses--Angela Castro, Antonio Gonzalez-\n\nVega, Daniel Sanchez-Ortiz, and Kelvin Moro-Ortiz--by stating\n\nthat they would have concocted more damaging stories if they had\n\nbeen lying in order to curry favor with the government.            We have\n\nrepeatedly held that this type of argument crosses the bounds of\n\npermissible conduct.      See Auch, 187 F.3d at 132; United States\n\nv. Manning, 23 F.3d 570, 575 (1st Cir. 1994).           As we stated in\n\nAuch, \"prosecutors in this circuit should consider themselves\n\nwell advised to strike such commentary from their repetoires.\"\n\n187 F.3d at 132.\n\n          We do not condone the continuing disregard for our\n\nprecedents by federal prosecutors in Puerto Rico.            See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Gonzalez-Gonzalez, 136 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir.\n\n1998) (citing cases); see also United States v. Capone, 683 F.2d\n\n582, 586 (1st Cir. 1982) (noting that a new trial may be\n\nappropriate if \"sanction is needed to deter future prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct\").     Here, the prosecutor's argument is all the more\n\nproblematic given that it occurred in rebuttal, was not followed\n\nby a cautionary instruction, and occurred in a case that rested\n\nlargely   on    the   testimony   of     cooperating   witnesses    whose\n\n\n\n\n                                  -25-\n\fcredibility was crucial to determining guilt.                  See Auch, 187\n\nF.3d at 129, 132.\n\n              However, the prosecution's vouching extended to only\n\nfour relatively minor witnesses; no claim is made that other key\n\nwitnesses--specifically Gongolon, Goglas, and Dominicci--were\n\nimproperly     vouched    for.     Their      testimony,    which    was   often\n\ncorroborated by testimonial and tangible evidence, was more than\n\nenough to establish the drug conspiracy as to all appellants\n\nbeyond reasonable doubt.          See United States v. Palmer, 203 F.3d\n\n55, 59 (1st Cir. 2000).               Although the issue is close, the\n\nprosecutor's inexcusable remarks do not warrant a new trial.\n\n              Finally, the appellants claim that the prosecution\n\nimproperly shifted the burden of proof by remarking to the jury\n\nthat the defense failed to keep its promise in opening statement\n\nto ask certain questions about the drug trafficking relationship\n\nbetween Perez and Hector Dominicci.             Whether or not this remark\n\ncrosses the line, see United States v. Savarese, 649 F.2d 83, 87\n\n(1st   Cir.    1981),    the   district      judge   removed   any   threat   of\n\nprejudice by immediately striking the statement and clearly\n\ninstructing      the    jury   that    the    burden   of   proof    beyond    a\n\nreasonable doubt rested squarely with the prosecution.\n\n                          V.     JURY INSTRUCTIONS\n\n\n\n\n                                       -26-\n\f          Ayala and Perez contend that the district court's\n\nrefusal to     give a \"buyer-seller\" jury instruction constitutes\n\nreversible error.     Such an instruction would have informed the\n\njury that a buyer and seller in a single drug transaction are\n\nnot invariably part of a drug conspiracy.                  United States v.\n\nMoran, 984 F.2d 1299, 1302 (1st Cir. 1993).            The classic example\n\nis a single sale for personal use and without prearrangement.\n\nId. at 1302-04.\n\n          We noted in Moran that other variations on this classic\n\ncase might raise additional problems, but we need not address\n\nany of them in this case.             Appellants were entitled to the\n\n\"buyer-seller\" instruction only if the record, taken in the\n\nlight   most   congenial       to   their   theory    of   the   case,   could\n\nplausibly support it.      United States v. Rodriguez, 858 F.2d 809,\n\n812 (1st Cir. 1988).       Here, overwhelming evidence showed that\n\nAyala and Perez agreed to import drugs with the intent to\n\ndistribute them, and engaged in repeated transactions of large\n\nquantities of narcotic drugs for resale.             This evidence does not\n\nplausibly support a mere buyer-seller relationship.\n\n                         VI.    SENTENCING ISSUES\n\n          Ayala    and    Perez's     sentencing      claims.      These   two\n\nappellants challenge their sentences on several grounds, three\n\nof which are common to them both.           As background, we start with\n\n\n                                     -27-\n\fa description of Ayala and Perez's sentencing proceedings.                                In\n\naccordance with settled practice at the time, United States v.\n\nLindia,    82     F.3d    1154,     1160-61       (1st       Cir.   1996),    the   court\n\nproceeded to determine the quantity of drugs involved in the\n\noffense.        Relying upon trial evidence, the court concluded that\n\nmore     than    150     kilograms        of   cocaine       were   involved       in   the\n\nconspiracy and fairly attributable to both Ayala and Perez.\n\n            This figure was far more than needed to trigger the\n\nstatutory maximum life sentence, 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A), and\n\nenough to set their guideline base offense levels at 38, the\n\nhighest unadjusted level for drug crimes, U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1\n\n(1998).         With a criminal history category of IV, Ayala was\n\ninitially subject to a 324 to 405 month sentence, and Perez,\n\nwith a criminal history category of III, was initially subject\n\nto   a   term     of   292     to   365    months.           U.S.S.G.   Ch.    5    Pt.    A\n\n(sentencing table).\n\n            However, the court found that life sentences were\n\nmandated in each case for at least two reasons.                          First, after\n\nmaking the requisite factual findings, the court applied two\n\nupward departures to each appellant's base offense level: a two-\n\nlevel     increase       for    possession        of     a    firearm,       U.S.S.G.      §\n\n2D1.1(b)(1), and a four-level increase for being an organizer or\n\n\n\n\n                                           -28-\n\fleader of the conspiracy, id. § 3B1.1.        With these enhancements,\n\nPerez and Ayala were subject to life terms.\n\n            Second, as an alternative, the court applied U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2D1.1(d)(1)'s murder cross reference, which says that \"[i]f a\n\nvictim was killed under circumstances that would constitute\n\nmurder under 18 U.S.C. § 1111\" the sentencing court shall apply\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2A1.1.      The court found, by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence, that Ayala was responsible for the murders of Joito el\n\nOrejon and Michael and Eddie Vazquez, and that Perez had ordered\n\nthe murder of Sol Garcia.       Accordingly, it increased their base\n\noffense levels to 43, as specified in section 2A1.1.           The pair\n\nwere again subject to life terms.\n\n            Third, the court determined that Ayala (but not Perez)\n\nwas subject to a mandatory life sentence under 21 U.S.C. §\n\n841(b)(1)(A) because she had two or more prior drug felony\n\nconvictions.\n\n            Finally, the court proceeded to sentence the appellants\n\non   the   money   laundering   count.   At   the   outset,   the   court\n\ndeclined to group the two counts of conviction under U.S.S.G. §\n\n3D1.2 since the drug offenses involved murder and thus distinct\n\nvictims and harms.      It then calculated a combined base offense\n\nlevel of 43 and applied it to the money laundering conviction.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3D1.4.     The court then imposed a sentence of 20 years\n\n\n                                  -29-\n\fon each Ayala and Perez, the maximum allowed by statute.                         18\n\nU.S.C. § 1956(a)(1).\n\n            First, Ayala and Perez say the district court violated\n\ntheir rights under Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000),\n\nwhen it sentenced them to life in prison based on the court's\n\ndetermination of drug quantity.               The default statutory maximum\n\nfor the cocaine conspiracy would be 20 years if no quantity were\n\ndetermined; life imprisonment becomes the statute's maximum only\n\nwhere five kilograms or more is involved.                  Compare 21 U.S.C. §\n\n841(b)(1)(C) with id. § 841(b)(1)(A).                 Ayala and Perez say,\n\ncorrectly, that under Apprendi quantity determinations that push\n\nthe actual sentence imposed beyond the otherwise applicable\n\nstatutory    maximum      must   be    determined     by    a    jury   beyond    a\n\nreasonable doubt.\n\n            Although Ayala and Perez were sentenced in July and\n\nAugust of 1999, before Apprendi was decided in 2000, there is no\n\nbar to applying that decision now to their direct appeals.\n\nUnited States v. Barone, 114 F.3d 1284, 1293 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\nNevertheless,    it    is   settled     that    an   Apprendi     error   can    be\n\nharmless    where   the     evidence    overwhelmingly          establishes     the\n\nminimum drug quantity needed to justify a higher statutory\n\nmaximum.     United States v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 62 (1st Cir.\n\n2001); Sustache-Rivera v. United States, 221 F.3d 8, 17-18 (1st\n\n\n                                       -30-\n\fCir. 2000).      Although the parties disagree as to whether an\n\nApprendi claim was properly preserved at trial, our conclusion\n\nwould be the same under any standard of review.\n\n            At trial, the government produced overwhelming evidence\n\nthat the conspiracy involved at least five kilograms of cocaine.\n\nFor example, Hector Dominicci testified to transporting and\n\nstoring huge quantities of cocaine for Ayala and Perez.                  On one\n\noccasion alone he handled 20 sacks of cocaine, each containing\n\nseveral kilograms of the drug.                Further, Victor Rodriguez,\n\nanother of Jockey's contacts, testified that Ayala received\n\ndrugs from air drops, each of which involved between 600 and\n\n1,000 kilograms of cocaine.           The record is replete with other\n\nexamples    as   well,   involving         Ayala,    Perez,    or    their     co-\n\nconspirators.6        Sepulveda,      15    F.3d     at    1197;    U.S.S.G.     §\n\n1B1.3(a)(1)(B).\n\n            Relying   upon    this    evidence,      the    sentencing       court\n\nultimately determined that the conspiracy involved more than 150\n\nkilograms of cocaine, or thirty times more than needed to impose\n\na   life   sentence   under   21     U.S.C.    §    841(b)(1)(A).       Neither\n\nappellant seriously denies that the conspiracy involved at least\n\nfive kilograms of cocaine.            In fact, Ayala makes no effort\n\n\n      6\n     For example, Danny Gongolon testified that he sold Ayala 37\nkilograms of cocaine between 1994 and 1995 and received more\nthan 10 kilograms from her on credit between 1995 and 1997.\n\n                                     -31-\n\fwhatsoever to undermine the accuracy of the sentencing court's\n\nfindings.    And Perez takes aim at the wrong target for Apprendi\n\npurposes--the 150 kilograms figure--conceding in his brief and\n\nat sentencing that he was responsible for more than 50 kilograms\n\nof cocaine.\n\n            Insofar as Perez attacks the district court's finding\n\nof drug amount as affecting the guidelines range, Apprendi is\n\nsimply beside the point.          United States v. Caba, 241 F.3d 98,\n\n101 (1st Cir. 2001).        And we find no clear error in the larger\n\nfigure   calculated    by   the       court.       United    States   v.   Rivera-\n\nMaldonado, 194 F.3d 224, 228 n.2 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n            Next, Ayala and Perez challenge the sentencing court's\n\napplication    of    U.S.S.G.     §    2A1.1,      the    first   degree    murder\n\nprovision cross-referenced by section 2D1.1(d)(1), on several\n\nlegal grounds.       Their argument is that the sentencing court\n\nagain violated Apprendi by finding, under a preponderance of the\n\nevidence standard, that they played a role in various conspiracy\n\nmurders,    thus    subjecting        them    to   life     imprisonment.      The\n\nargument fails, however, because               Apprendi does not apply to\n\nfindings made for purposes of the sentencing guidelines, such as\n\nthe court's determinations that the appellants were accountable\n\nfor the murders.      Caba, 241 F.3d at 101.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -32-\n\f          Two other arguments on this score require only the\n\nbriefest discussion.      Ayala and Perez say that the murders are\n\nirrelevant to drug crime sentencing because neither U.S.S.G. §\n\n2A1.1   nor   the   cross-reference     table   in    Appendix   A   of   the\n\nGuideline Manual mentions the drug statutes.             To the contrary,\n\nthe murders can be taken into account when sentencing for the\n\ndrug crimes; U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1 explicitly cross-references the\n\nmurder provision of section 2A1.1.         See United States v. Padro\n\nBurgos, 239 F.3d 72, 76-77 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n          Ayala and Perez also suggest that because the cross-\n\nreference refers to 18 U.S.C. § 1111 (1994), which embraces both\n\nfirst and second degree murder, a court might apply the higher\n\nbase offense level for a first degree murder case where only\n\nsecond degree murder had been established.             Compare U.S.S.G. §\n\n2A1.1 (level 43) with id. § 2A1.2 (level 33).             In the present\n\ncase this is a fanciful concern since the murders committed by\n\nthe conspiracy were plainly \"willful, deliberate, malicious [or]\n\npremeditated\" and so within the definition of first degree\n\nmurder under 18 U.S.C. § 1111.\n\n          Separately, Ayala renews her objection to the district\n\ncourt's   determination    that   she    had    two   prior   drug   felony\n\nconvictions and was thus subject to a mandatory life sentence\n\nunder 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A).           At sentencing, and now on\n\n\n                                  -33-\n\fappeal,   Ayala   acknowledges        having    two     prior    felony    drug\n\nconvictions   but     says    the     court    should    have     lumped   the\n\nconvictions together because they represent a single episode of\n\nongoing criminal conduct.\n\n          Prior      felony    drug     convictions      will     be   counted\n\nseparately for purposes of 21 U.S.C. § 841(b) only when they\n\nrepresent distinct criminal episodes.              See United States v.\n\nGillies, 851 F.2d 492, 497 (1st Cir. 1988).                     Ayala's prior\n\nconvictions   stem    from    several    transactions,      occurring      over\n\nseveral months and involving different drugs.7                  There was no\n\nerror in treating these convictions as distinct.                 As the Ninth\n\nCircuit has reasoned:\n\n    An ongoing course of criminal conduct such as\n    narcotics trafficking may involve many such criminal\n    episodes, each a discrete occurrence. The fact that\n    all are related, part of a series, or part of a\n    continuous course of criminal dealing, does not\n    necessarily render them a 'single' criminal episode,\n    particularly where the episodes occur over time. To\n    so hold would insulate the very career criminals the\n    statute is designed to reach--those continuously\n    engaged in criminal conduct.\n\n\n\n    7 The Commonwealth levied four charges against Ayala for\ndistributing cocaine on at least four different dates between\nOctober 1990 and March 1991.        These charges were later\nconsolidated. The federal government, after conducting its own\ninvestigation, charged Ayala with distributing heroin as well,\napparently in or around July 1991, the date of her arrest for\nthat crime. She pled guilty to the charges and received a five-\nyear sentence on the Commonwealth charge(s), and a six-month\nsentence on the federal charge, to be served concurrently.\n\n                                      -34-\n\fUnited States v. Maxey, 989 F.2d 303, 307 (9th Cir. 1993); see\n\nalso United States v. Griffin, 109 F.3d 706, 708 (11th Cir.\n\n1997).\n\n            Separately,     Perez    renews   an   objection       he    made   at\n\nsentencing, claiming the court had no basis for imposing a four-\n\nlevel    enhancement   for    his    role   in    the    drug    offense.       He\n\nacknowledges    that   he    ran    some    operating     units       within    the\n\nconspiracy    (e.g.,   his    drug    points)      and    that    a     two-level\n\nenhancement is probably warranted.               But he denies leading or\n\nmanaging the overarching conspiracy, arguing that a four-level\n\nenhancement is only appropriate for those individuals at the\n\nvery top of its organization (e.g., those who coordinated among\n\nthe multiple smaller operating units).              Cf. United States v.\n\nTejada-Beltran, 50 F.3d 105, 111 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n            We review role-in-the-offense determinations, steeped\n\nin the facts of the case, for clear error.                 United States v.\n\nCadavid, 192 F.3d 230, 237 (1st Cir. 1999).                 Here, the four-\n\nlevel increase is justified \"if the defendant was an organizer\n\nor leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more\n\nparticipants or was otherwise extensive . . . .\"                      U.S.S.G. §\n\n3B1.1(a).\n\n            The record shows that Perez ran at least two separate\n\ndrug points and supervised the work of at least five other\n\n\n                                     -35-\n\fpeople, including three sellers at the Los Lirios del Sur drug\n\npoint; the runner, Daniel Sanchez-Ortiz; and another individual\n\nat the Santiago Iglesias point.                  See United States v. Li, 206\n\nF.3d 78, 91-92 (1st Cir. 2000).                   He also worked with Ayala in\n\nretrieving    drug     shipments          and    distributing          them       among   the\n\norganization's other drug points.\n\n          This is perhaps a close case because Ayala was more\n\nclearly   a   leader,        although      a     conspiracy          may    have    several\n\nindividuals     deserving       a   four-level           enhancement,            U.S.S.G.    §\n\n3B1.1, App. Note 4, and the district court gets the benefit of\n\nreview only for clear error.               However, it does not much matter\n\nwhether Perez is on one side of the line or the other because\n\neven a smaller three-level enhancement for being a manager or\n\nsupervisor      of    criminal       activity          involving           five    or     more\n\nparticipants,        when     combined          with     the    two-level          firearms\n\nenhancement (which Perez does not challenge on appeal), lifts\n\nPerez's base offense level to 43 and subjects him to a life\n\nterm.\n\n          Lastly,       Ayala       and    Perez        say    the    court       erred     in\n\nsentencing them to 20 years for the money laundering conviction.\n\nThey say the proper guideline range for the money laundering\n\noffense   was    121    to    151    months,           well    below       the    240-month\n\n\n\n\n                                          -36-\n\fsentences they received.        However, they misread the guidelines\n\nand the sentencing record.\n\n             It is quite true that if the money laundering count\n\nwere the only count of conviction, it would carry an adjusted\n\noffense level of 30, after factoring in various enhancements.\n\nThis, presumably, is the figure Ayala and Perez use to calculate\n\ntheir sentencing ranges.8          The difficulty with the argument is\n\nthat it ignores the manner in which the guidelines establish a\n\nsingle combined offense level for multiple-count convictions and\n\nuse   that    offense   level   for       sentencing   on   each     count   of\n\nconviction, subject to statutory maximums.\n\n             As already explained, the adjusted offense level for\n\nthe   drug   conspiracy    count    for    both   appellants   was    43   (the\n\nmaximum allowed).         U.S.S.G. § 3D1.4 provides a formula for\n\ncombining the offense level 43 and offense level 30 that results\n\nin a combined offense level for all counts of conviction of 43.\n\nThe district court applied this formula because it held that the\n\ndrug and money laundering convictions should not be grouped\n\ntogether under U.S.S.G. § 3D1.2--a judgment that Ayala and Perez\n\ndo not challenge and we need not independently address.               Compare\n\n\n      8\n     With a criminal history category of IV, Ayala would be\nsubject to a term of 135 to 168 months. Thus, it is unclear why\nshe claims that the appropriate range was 121 to 151 months;\nthis latter range applies to defendants, like Perez, with a\ncriminal history category III.\n\n                                     -37-\n\fUnited States v. Harper, 972 F.2d 321, 322 (11th Cir. 1992), and\n\nUnited States v. Gallo, 927 F.2d 815, 824 (5th Cir. 1991), with\n\nLopez v. United States, 104 F.3d 1149, 1150-51 (9th Cir. 1996).\n\n          Once this single combined offense level is determined,\n\nthe   guidelines    direct    that    it    be   used    for   each    count   of\n\nconviction.        U.S.S.G.    §     5G1.2(b).          The    only    pertinent\n\nqualification is that the sentence not exceed the statutory\n\nmaximum for the relevant count.             Id. § 5G1.1(a).           It was for\n\nthat reason that despite the combined offense level of 43, the\n\ncourt limited the money laundering sentence to the statutory\n\nmaximum of 20 years.     See 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1).             Since the 20-\n\nyear sentence runs concurrently and is shorter than the life\n\nsentence, Ayala and Perez are not demonstrably worse off; but in\n\nany event the money laundering sentence is consistent with the\n\nexplicit directions of the guidelines.\n\n          Martinez's sentencing claims.             Martinez was the first\n\nof the appellants to be sentenced, in late May 1999, and his\n\nproceeding differed slightly from that of Ayala and Perez.                     The\n\ncourt first found that Martinez had participated in the murders\n\nof Bejumen and his wife.           Applying the cross-reference to the\n\nmurder provision of the guidelines, U.S.S.G. § 2A1.1, the court\n\ncalculated Martinez's base offense level at 43.                It then granted\n\nhim a two-level downward departure for being a minor participant\n\nin the conspiracy, reducing his offense level to 41.                      With a\n\n                                     -38-\n\fcriminal   history    category   of   I,   Martinez   was    subject   to   a\n\nguideline sentencing range of 324 to 405 months, and the court\n\nimposed the maximum sentence within that range.\n\n           Notably,    the    sentencing    court     made    no   findings\n\nconcerning drug quantity at the hearing; instead, it merely\n\nrecited that the jury had found Martinez guilty of conspiracy to\n\ndistribute \"multi kilo quantities of drugs.\"           This was arguably\n\nerror under the guidelines, because absent any drug quantity\n\ndetermination, the maximum statutory sentence applicable to\n\nMartinez's crime was 20 years and he was given nearly 34 years.\n\nSee U.S.S.G. § 5G1.1.        Martinez, however, did not object to the\n\nerror at sentencing.      And in his second supplemental brief in\n\nthis court, he concedes several times that he was responsible\n\nfor more than 500 grams of cocaine, thus exposing him to a\n\nsentencing range of five to 40 years.9\n\n           Martinez did make two objections at sentencing: first,\n\nthat he was being sentenced for a crime (murder) for which he\n\nwas neither charged nor convicted.          On appeal, he renews this\n\nclaim under the guise of Apprendi, suggesting, as do Ayala and\n\n\n\n    9The district court would have had no difficulty finding\nMartinez responsible for over 500 grams of cocaine. Martinez\nwas familiar with the Garcia drug point, which involved large\nquantities of cocaine, and the drug point transactions were\nforeseeable acts in the conspiracy Martinez joined through the\nmurder of Bejumen and his wife. See Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1197.\n\n                                   -39-\n\fPerez, that application of the cross-reference violates his due\n\nprocess rights.        But Martinez's concession as to drug quantity\n\nis fatal to this claim of error.            The sentence he received was\n\nbelow the statutory maximum of 40 years; as explained above,\n\nApprendi is not implicated.\n\n            Second,      Martinez    made      a       truncated    argument     at\n\nsentencing concerning the sufficiency of the evidence of his\n\nparticipation in the murders.            On appeal, he says the evidence\n\nof the murder was inconsistent.          Even assuming this argument was\n\nfully preserved--which is doubtful--our review is only for clear\n\nerror    because       Apprendi     is   not       implicated       (the     murder\n\ndetermination affected only the guidelines determination, not\n\nthe statutory maximum).           The district court heard admissible\n\nhearsay evidence at trial directly implicating Martinez in the\n\nmurder; the hearsay was broadly consistent with an eyewitness\n\naccount of the murders; we can hardly say it was clear error for\n\nthe court to credit that evidence.             United States v. Cunningham,\n\n201 F.3d 20, 28-29 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n            Finally, in a post-argument motion for supplemental\n\nbriefing on the Apprendi issue, Martinez brings to the court's\n\nattention       the   December    2001   sentencing        of     the   three   co-\n\ndefendants who were not part of this appeal.                   Martinez complains\n\nthat    these    co-defendants      received       a    more    lenient    sentence\n\n\n                                     -40-\n\fbecause the sentencing court felt constrained by the intervening\n\nApprendi decision.       Without intimating any judgment as to these\n\nlatter sentencing decisions, whose circumstances are far from\n\nclear, we decline Martinez's request for supplemental briefing\n\non the issue.      Suffice it to say that two similar defendants can\n\neasily receive different results depending on whether their\n\nsentences     come    before     or   after    a    watershed     opinion    like\n\nApprendi.      Compare United States v. Rivera-Maldonado, 124 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 788, 790 (D.P.R. 2000) (declining in post-Apprendi\n\nsentencing to make drug quantity determination and sentencing\n\ndefendant to lowest statutory maximum), with Duarte, 246 F.3d at\n\n62 (upholding pre-Apprendi sentence despite Apprendi error on\n\nbasis that defendant acknowledged responsibility for relevant\n\ndrug quantity); cf. Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 306-07 (1989).\n\n\n\n                        VII.     POST-TRIAL EVIDENCE\n\n             Finally, Martinez and Perez separately assert a right\n\nto a new trial in light of new evidence, either on the ground\n\nthat the evidence was withheld by the prosecution in violation\n\nof   Brady    v.     Maryland,    373   U.S.       83   (1963),   or,   in    the\n\nalternative, that it was newly discovered evidence warranting a\n\nretrial under Fed. R. Crim. P. 33.                  Both appellants rely on\n\n\n\n\n                                      -41-\n\fstatements by government informants that arguably impeach that\n\nof government witnesses at trial.\n\n           Since the government does not dispute that the evidence\n\nwas in the possession of the prosecution and not disclosed to\n\nthe defense, we apply the more generous Brady standard.                United\n\nStates v. Josleyn, 206 F.3d 144, 151-52 (1st Cir. 2000).                 Under\n\nBrady, violation of the prosecution's duty to disclose warrants\n\nretrial if the defendant can show a \"reasonable probability\" of\n\nprejudice,     that   is,    that      the    \"favorable    evidence     could\n\nreasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different\n\nlight as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\"                 Kyles v.\n\nWhitley, 514 U.S. 419, 435 (1995); see also Strickler v. Greene,\n\n527 U.S. 263, 289 (1999).           Here we discern no possibility of\n\nprejudice in either case.\n\n           Martinez’s Brady argument is based on a sworn statement\n\nin which Jaime Rivera-Morales, a former Puerto Rico police\n\nofficer, admits to being one of the \"police officers\" who helped\n\nkidnap the Vazquezes but states that the murder was arranged by\n\nJose Galiany on behalf of Santos Martinez, a drug dealer with no\n\napparent     connection     to   the    Garcias.      The    statement    was\n\ndiscovered after the verdict in this case, during a preliminary\n\nhearing in the Commonwealth trial of Manuel Garcia and Ventura\n\nfor the Vazquez murders.          Martinez says this statement could\n\n\n                                       -42-\n\fhave been used to impeach the credibility of Gongolon, and more\n\nimportantly,         Goglas,     who   was    the     main   witness       implicating\n\nMartinez in Bejumen's murder.\n\n            Wrongly withheld impeachment evidence, if powerful\n\nenough, can be prejudicial and grounds for a new trial.                         United\n\nStates v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 676-77 (1985); United States v.\n\nPatrick, 248 F.3d 11, 25 (1st Cir. 2001).                    This is particularly\n\ntrue   where     the    evidence       is    highly      impeaching    or    when    the\n\nwitness'    testimony       is    uncorroborated          and    essential     to    the\n\nconviction.       See Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154-55\n\n(1972).\n\n            But      here   the    statement        by   Rivera     does    little    to\n\nundermine      the     confidence      of    the    verdict      against     Martinez.\n\nAlthough it is true that Goglas's testimony as to the Teta-\n\nGarcia    pact    and    the   Bejumen       murder      provided    the    main    link\n\nbetween Martinez and the drug conspiracy,                        see Part I above,\n\nRivera's    statement          does    not     directly         undermine     Goglas’s\n\ntestimony on that crucial point, since it relates to the Vazquez\n\nmurders.    Such weak impeachment evidence on an issue tangential\n\nto the conviction is not sufficient to warrant the drastic\n\nremedy of a new trial.             See Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1220 n.5;\n\nUnited States v. Nash, 29 F.3d 1195, 1202 (7th Cir. 1994).\n\n\n\n\n                                            -43-\n\f               The   withheld     material     Perez       complains     of   is   more\n\ndirectly related to the evidence against him.                     Perez points to\n\na report prepared by DEA Agent Clifford memorializing several\n\ninterviews       with    Samuel     Arce-Leon,    a    cooperating        government\n\ninformant.       According to one of the reports, Arce stated that he\n\noverheard a conversation between other drug dealers who said\n\nthat Ayala ordered Ricardo Carrasquillo and another individual\n\nto murder Sol Garcia because she wanted to take over the Los\n\nLirios del Sur drug point.             According to Arce, Ayala and Perez\n\nthen    took    over    the   drug   point.       Perez      claims      that   Arce's\n\ntestimony is corroborated by eyewitness testimony regarding the\n\nphysical appearance of the killers.10\n\n               Even taking the evidence most favorably to Perez, it\n\ndoes    not     undermine     our    confidence       in    his   drug    conspiracy\n\nconviction.          Perez's participation in Sol Garcia's murder was\n\nhardly important to the jury’s drug conspiracy verdict given the\n\noverwhelming evidence--including testimony of other witnesses\n\nand physical evidence such as drug ledgers--that Perez helped\n\nAyala retrieve drugs from Jockey and ran the Los Lirios del Sur\n\nand Santo Iglesias drug points.              Cf. Strickler, 527 U.S. at 294.\n\n\n       10\n      This eyewitness testified that two men--one light-skinned\nand one dark-skinned--killed Sol Garcia; Sanchez-Ortiz testified\nthat both men were dark-skinned. Since Carrasquillo is white,\nthe testimony lends some support to Arce's version of the\nevents.\n\n                                        -44-\n\f           The    Sol    Garcia     murder    had   more   relevance      in   the\n\nsentencing    phase,      where     the    district   court   cited    Perez's\n\ninvolvement to trigger a life sentence under U.S.S.G. § 2A1.1,\n\nthe murder provision cross-referenced in U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(d).\n\nBut Arce's statement was disclosed before sentencing, and the\n\ndistrict   court,       after   a   full   hearing    in   which   both    Agent\n\nClifford and Arce          testified, nevertheless determined by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that Perez was implicated in\n\nGarcia's murder.\n\n           Apart from his Apprendi claim, Perez did not dispute\n\non appeal the sufficiency of the evidence implicating him in Sol\n\nGarcia's murder.        Even reading Perez's Brady claim generously as\n\nincluding an attack on the evidentiary basis for the sentence,\n\nwe cannot say that the district court's sentencing decision was\n\nclearly erroneous, especially given the ambiguities in Arce's\n\nstatement.    See United States v. Meyer, 234 F.3d 319, 326 (7th\n\nCir. 2000).      In any event, because of the district court's other\n\ndeterminations based on drug quantity and enhancements, any\n\nerror would have been harmless.              See Part VI, above.\n\n           The judgments of conviction, the sentences, and denials\n\nof post-trial motions are affirmed.\n\n                                             Concurrence follows.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -45-\n\f             TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge (Concurring). I have not been\n\ncoy in expressing my views concerning prosecutorial misconduct.\n\nSee generally United States v. Moreno, 991 F.2d 943, 949-53 (1st\n\nCir. 1993) (Torruella, J., dissenting).             Thus, while I agree\n\nthat in the final analysis the improper statements made by the\n\nprosecutors in closing argument do not warrant a new trial, I\n\nwrite separately to emphasize my impatience with the office of\n\nthe United States Attorney for the District of Puerto Rico.\n\nDespite     numerous    warnings   from   panels    of   this    Court,   its\n\nprosecutors continue to flout clear rules of ethical conduct in\n\ntheir zeal to secure convictions.\n\n             The problem of prosecutorial misconduct in closing\n\narguments is by no means confined to the District of Puerto\n\nRico.     Cf. Bennett L. Gershman, Prosecutorial Misconduct § 11:1,\n\nat 11-3     (2d ed. 2001) (noting that such misconduct has \"become\n\nstaple in American prosecutions\" and \"shows no sign of abating\n\nor   being    checked    by   institutional    or    other      sanctions\").\n\nNevertheless, federal prosecutors in Puerto Rico are conspicuous\n\nin this circuit -- and, indeed, throughout this country -- for\n\ntheir recalcitrance.11        See Paul J. Speigelman, Prosecutorial\n\n\n     11\n      A review of our cases from the past fifteen years\ndemonstrates the startling frequency with which we have found\nclosing remarks by prosecutors in the District of Puerto Rico to\nbe improper. See United States v. Rodríguez, 215 F.3d 110 (1st\nCir. 2000), cert. denied, --- U.S. ---, 121 S.

Antonelli Fireworks Co., 155 F.2d 631, 661 (2d Cir.\n\n1946) (Frank, J., dissenting).               A tonic more potent than our\n\nwritten rebukes appears necessary.\n\n             Thus, I believe it is critical to emphasize a point\n\nthat   our        prior   condemnations       have    perhaps     overlooked.\n\nStatements such as the ones found in this case are not merely\n\npassages     in    a   trial   transcript     that   constitute   fodder   for\n\narguments on appeal.           They are instances of unethical behavior\n\nthat virtually all sources of authority condemn with a single\n\n\n                                      -48-\n\fvoice.    See ABA Standards for Criminal Justice § 3-5.8 (3d ed.\n\n1993); Model Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 3.4(e); Code of\n\nProfessional Responsibility, DR 7-106(C); Restatement (Third)\n\nThe Law Governing Lawyers, § 107 (2000).            It is well established\n\nthat district courts have, as a component of their inherent\n\npowers,   the     authority   to   sanction    such   unethical     behavior.\n\nUnited States v. Kourí-Pérez, 187 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1999).                I\n\nwould therefore urge our district courts to take a conscientious\n\nrole in addressing prosecutorial misconduct in the same manner\n\nthat they would address other forms of ethical misconduct: by\n\nacting swiftly and decisively to sanction and deter it.                   See\n\nUnited States v. Doe, 860 F.2d 488, 492 (1st Cir. 1988) (\"Rather\n\nthan reversal on appeal, the proper remedy would have been a\n\nreprimand    or    the   imposition    of    sanctions   by   the    district\n\ncourt.\").\n\n            Prosecutorial misconduct erodes our confidence in the\n\nvery government entities charged with protecting the public's\n\ninterests    through     enforcement    of    our   laws.     Moreover,    by\n\npresenting this Court time and again with convictions tarnished\n\nby misconduct, prosecutors breed further cynicism by asking us\n\nto affirm these convictions on harmless-error grounds.                    The\n\noverall effect is one that impugns the dignity of both the\n\n\n\n\n                                    -49-\n\fexecutive and the judiciary.   Its pernicious results are a cause\n\nof concern for all of us.\n\n         Given the numerous rebukes from this Court, and the\n\napparent disregard they have been shown, federal prosecutors in\n\nPuerto Rico should now be on notice that I, for one, will review\n\nwith heightened scrutiny their claims of harmless error arising\n\nfrom prosecutorial misconduct.\n\n\n\n\n                               -50-\n\f",

This set of appeals grows out of\n\nan    indictment   alleging    that     the   appellants,      along    with   76\n\nothers, were part of a sprawling drug smuggling and distribution\n\nnetwork in southwest Puerto Rico between 1994 and 1997.                        The\n\ntwo-count indictment charged Angela Ayala-Martinez (\"Ayala\") and\n\nManuel Perez-Colon (\"Perez\") with conspiracy to possess and\n\ndistribute    multi-kilogram       amounts      of   cocaine,     heroin,      and\n\nmarijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and 846 (1994)\n\nand   conspiracy   to     engage   in    illegal     financial    transactions\n\ninvolving    the   drug    proceeds      in   violation   of     18   U.S.C.    §§\n\n1956(a)(1) and 1957 (1994).             Perez's money laundering charge\n\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 1957, but not § 1956(a)(1), was later dropped.\n\nAppellant Marcos Martinez-Medina (\"Martinez\") was charged only\n\nwith participating in the drug conspiracy.\n\n            The three appellants were tried along with four other\n\nco-defendants:     Manuel    Garcia-Torres       (\"Manuel\"),      his   brother\n\nAndres Garcia-Torres (\"Andres\"), Walter Batiz, and Deri Ventura.\n\nThe evidence presented during the forty-day trial was extensive,1\n\nand featured the testimony of several indicted co-conspirators\n\n\n\n\n       1\n     The evidence presented at trial was far more extensive and\ntherefore differed in some respects from the evidence presented\nin the case against Jaime Garcia-Torres, who was tried\nseparately for related offenses. See United States v. Garcia-\nTorres, ___ F.3d ___ (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n                                        -3-\n\fwho agreed to cooperate with the government in exchange for\n\nleniency.\n\n            In brief, it showed that in 1995, Ayala obtained a\n\ncontact with a Colombian dealer, Jorge Alicea-Serrano (a/k/a\n\n\"Jockey\"), to import large quantities of cocaine into Puerto\n\nRico.   The drugs were delivered by air and by sea, and Ayala\n\nhired   others--including   Andres    Garcia,   Perez,   Batiz,   and\n\nVentura--to retrieve them for her.\n\n            By virtue of her connection to Jockey, Ayala rose from\n\na small-time drug dealer to a major supplier to various drug\n\ndistribution points at housing projects in the city of Ponce.\n\nAmong them were drug points at Los Lirios Del Sur and Santiago\n\nIglesias, owned by Perez; La Atocha and Tibes, owned by Edwin\n\nMelendez Negron (a/k/a \"Danny Gongolon\"); and La Cantera, owned\n\nby the Garcias' older brother Tommy Garcia-Torres until his\n\ndeath in August 1995, when it was inherited by Manuel Garcia and\n\nVentura.    Batiz worked for Garcia and Ventura cutting drugs at\n\nLa Cantera.\n\n            Disputes at these drug points led to several violent\n\nkillings, which were not charged as crimes but were important to\n\nthe government's case both as conspiratorial acts and factors in\n\nsentencing.    According to the testimony of a cooperating witness\n\nnamed Daniel Sanchez-Ortiz, in or around 1996 Perez ordered the\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fmurder of Sol Garcia, owner of a competing drug point at Los\n\nLirios del Sur that was threatening Perez's sales.\n\n            At La Cantera, an internecine feud erupted in 1994 when\n\nTommy Garcia fired \"Gerardito\", his brother-in-law and drug\n\nrunner, because he allegedly stole $35,000 to $40,000 in drug\n\nproceeds.    After being ostracized from La Cantera, Gerardito and\n\nhis brother Nelsito began associating with Michael Vazquez and\n\nhis father Eddie; the Vazquezes owned a jewelry store and had no\n\ndemonstrated connection to the drug trade but had weapons and\n\nwere willing to help Gerardito seek revenge against the Garcias.\n\nA   war   soon    erupted   between   the   Garcias    and   their   allies--\n\nincluding Ventura, Ayala, and Gongolon--and Gerardito and his\n\nfaction--which       included    Nelsito,     the     Vazquezes,     and   the\n\nVazquezes' jewelry store employee, Jose Negron-Santiago (a/k/a\n\n\"Bejumen\").\n\n            A series of violent incidents ensued between the two\n\nfactions.        In 1995 Tommy Garcia and his trigger man, Abraham\n\nBorgos Santiago, were killed in separate incidents, as was\n\n\"Gordo\", a friend of Gerardito and Nelsito.               Each side pinned\n\nblame on the other.         In 1996, Eddie Vazquez shot and wounded\n\nDanny Gongolon.       On numerous occasions throughout this period,\n\nthe Garcias tried to find and kill Gerardito, Nelsito, the\n\nVazquezes, and Bejumen.\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f         On February 14, 1997, Bejumen and his wife Rosemarie\n\nwere shot and killed in their car.    Gamaliel Goglas-Valentin,\n\nwho worked part time for the Garcias at La Cantera and also\n\nhelped them store guns, testified that Andres, Manuel, and\n\nMarcos Martinez drove into the auto shop where he was working\n\nand celebrated openly that they had \"finally\" killed Bejumen.\n\nAs Andres described it, the three of them ambushed Bejumen's\n\ncar; Martinez and Andres then opened the door and shot Bejumen\n\nand his wife repeatedly at close range.\n\n         Four days later, Ayala, Manuel, Danny Gongolon, and\n\nVentura paid $20,000 to hire kidnappers to pose as policeman and\n\n\"arrest\" Michael Vazquez.     Although the testimony of various\n\nwitnesses is somewhat unclear as to the precise chain of events,\n\nit appears that the kidnappers handed Michael Vazquez over to\n\nassociates of the Garcia group--including Manuel and Andres\n\nGarcia, Gongolon, Ventura, and Batiz--who drove away with him\n\nand killed him.   They also found and shot Eddie Vazquez.   Ayala\n\nwas described as celebrating when she was told that the plan had\n\nbeen successfully executed.\n\n         The appellants were convicted as charged.    Ayala and\n\nPerez were sentenced to life imprisonment on the drug conspiracy\n\ncount and 20 years' imprisonment on the money laundering count,\n\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\fto be served concurrently; Martinez was sentenced to 405 months'\n\nimprisonment.    These appeals ensued.\n\n            The appellants' various claims can be grouped into\n\nseveral categories: sufficiency of the evidence as to certain\n\ncounts,     admissibility       of     specific     evidence,     alleged\n\nprosecutorial misconduct, improper jury instructions, sentencing\n\nrulings, and new trial claims based on new or withheld evidence.\n\nWe affirm the appellants' convictions and sentences in all\n\nrespects.\n\n                     I.   SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n            Single    versus   multiple      conspiracies.      All   three\n\nappellants argue that the evidence was insufficient to support\n\naspects of their convictions.              The first sufficiency issue,\n\nraised by Ayala and Perez, is the frequently raised but often\n\nmisunderstood claim that a single conspiracy found by the jury\n\nwas in fact multiple, independent conspiracies.2             If there was\n\nsuch \"variance\" between the indictment and the proof at trial,\n\nit might be grounds for reversal if it substantially prejudiced\n\nthe defendants' rights by, for example, allowing the jury to\n\ntransfer evidence of one conspiracy against defendants involved\n\n\n    2Because the defendants did not challenge the jury\ninstructions as to conspiracy, we review the issue for\nevidentiary sufficiency only.

The first focuses on the possibility that some\n\npeople charged in the indictment but not tried together with the\n\ndefendants      might      not   have     been     implicated       in   the     same\n\nconspiracy--in       particular,         other    drug     point    owners       whose\n\nassociation     with    Ayala     and    the   Garcias     may    have   been     more\n\ntangential.

But the appellants make no sustained argument as to\n\nunfair prejudice.\n\n            Appellants' main \"variance\" claim is that not all of\n\nthose   tried      together      were    engaged      in   the     single    charged\n\nconspiracy.     This is essentially a challenge to the sufficiency\n\nof the evidence.            Townsend, 924 F.2d at 1389.                  As in all\n\nsufficiency claims, we take the evidence, including issues of\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fcredibility, in the light most favorable to the government and\n\nask whether a rational jury could easily find guilt beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.

Ayala supplied the drugs and profited\n\nfrom their resale, while the Garcias, Ventura, and Batiz ran the\n\nresale operation and took steps--often violent--to protect it.\n\nThis   ongoing     operation     could       be     found       to     constitute      a\n\nconspiracy.

Were this Perez's\n\nonly connection to Ayala, it might be arguable that Perez was\n\nnot part of the same conspiracy as the La Cantera operators.                          In\n\na case where a common supplier is the sole link between diverse\n\ndistributors, it may be more difficult to sustain a finding of\n\ncommon agreement,       see, e.g., Kotteakos, 328 U.S. at 754-56;\n\nGlenn, 828 F.2d at 858, although even then one could be inferred\n\nby   additional    evidence--e.g.,       a     finding      that           the   various\n\ndistributors depended on one another for the health of their own\n\ndrug business, see United States v.

From there, Perez distributed the drugs to the drug\n\npoints per Ayala's instructions.      This evidence is more than\n\nsufficient to show that Perez was in a single conspiracy with\n\nAyala and the La Cantera operators to distribute narcotics.\n\n           Evidence as to Martinez.   Martinez argues separately\n\nthat even if the other co-defendants were part of a single drug\n\nconspiracy, he was not part of it.    Martinez paints himself as\n\na \"hired gun\" who participated in the murder of Bejumen Santiago\n\nat the behest of the Garcias but did not share or even know of\n\ntheir purpose to promote the drug operations.\n\n           There is evidence that Martinez was directly involved\n\nin drug dealing.    Goglas testified that Martinez worked for\n\nJulio Teta, a friend of Manuel Garcia who was starting a new\n\ndrug point at Guanica.   Teta, usually accompanied by Martinez,\n\nwent to Goglas' house almost every day to pick up drugs from\n\nGarcia for the drug point.   Perhaps this evidence would suffice\n\nfor the jury to infer that through these repeated purchases of\n\ndrugs for resale, Martinez joined the Garcias' drug enterprise.\n\nSee United States v.

Sometime prior to\n\nFebruary 1997, Teta agreed to help Garcia in his conflict with\n\n\n                              -11-\n\fGerardito in exchange for help with some problems he was having\n\nat the Guanica drug point.                  The evidence that Martinez was\n\nregularly       involved      in   drug     dealing     with    Teta         provides      a\n\nreasonable basis for the jury to infer that he also knew about\n\nthe working arrangements between Teta and Garcia; this is the\n\nmost       straightforward     way    to    explain   how      he    came     to    assist\n\nGarcia, for whom he did not otherwise work, in carrying out the\n\nmurder of Bejumen--which (as will be seen) can be deemed a part\n\nof the larger conspiracy.\n\n               This    inference     is    reinforced    by     the      fact      that   on\n\nanother occasion Teta and Martinez unsuccessfully went out to\n\nfind and kill Nelsito and Gerardito using guns supplied by\n\nManuel Garcia.          Based on this evidence--Teta's pact with Manuel\n\nGarcia, Martinez's relationship with Teta, and Martinez's overt\n\nacts on behalf of Manuel Garcia--a jury could reasonably infer\n\nthat Martinez agreed to join the Garcias' drug operation in the\n\ncapacity of an enforcer.\n\n               Virtually all of the evidence linking Martinez to the\n\nconspiracy came in through the testimony of Goglas,5 and Martinez\n\nargues       that     the   uncorroborated        testimony         of   a   government\n\n\n       5\n     Danny Gongolon also testified that he had seen Martinez at\nAyala's house on several occasions (including a barbecue party)\nbefore the murder of Bejumen, but Gongolon's testimony provided\nno specific information about the substance of Martinez and\nAyala's relationship.\n\n                                           -12-\n\finformant is not enough to convict.         That argument runs contrary\n\nto the law of this circuit, which leaves in the hands of the\n\njury decisions about credibility of witnesses \"so long as the\n\ntestimony is not incredible or insubstantial on its face.\"\n\nUnited   States     v.

Perez appeals the\n\ndenial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal on the money\n\nlaundering conspiracy count.         The government replies that Perez\n\nconspired    with    Ayala   to   engage   in   a   financial     transaction\n\ndesigned to conceal the unlawful proceeds in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i) (1994).          Specifically, the government\n\non appeal relies on an incident in which Ayala had her drug\n\npoint employee Hector Dominicci install air conditioning units\n\nin Perez's house.         Ayala paid Dominicci between $8,000 and\n\n$10,000 in cash, which she retrieved from the house of her\n\nfriend Maria Barbosa, who routinely hid drug money for her.\n\n            To prove a money laundering conspiracy under 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1956(a)(1)(B)(i), the government must show that Perez agreed\n\nto have the air conditioners installed knowing both that they\n\nwere paid for with illegal proceeds and that the transaction was\n\n\"designed, in whole or in part . . . to conceal or disguise the\n\nnature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fof the proceeds . . . .\"       Where the defendant is someone other\n\nthan the source of the illegal proceeds (here, Perez), the\n\nstatute is concerned with his knowledge of the source's intent\n\nin the transaction.

Concededly there is no direct evidence of\n\nAyala's intent in this transaction.          But the evidence indicates\n\nat least two other transactions between Ayala and Dominicci that\n\nsupport an inference of pattern.           In 1995 Ayala gave Dominicci\n\n$30,000 in small bills and had him buy a Ford Explorer for her\n\nin the name of his air conditioning company.            She also paid him\n\nabout   $16,000   in   cash   for   a   Mazda   that   was   registered   to\n\nDominicci's sister. Dominicci used the money to pay off the\n\nbalance on the car; the registration was never changed after the\n\nsale.\n\n          Purchasing large items with drug money through third\n\nparties surely supports an inference of intent to conceal.

He\n\nalso ran two drug points of his own.           Perez's deep involvement\n\nin Ayala's drug business is enough for a jury to find beyond a\n\nreasonable     doubt   that   when    Perez   agreed    to   have       the   air\n\nconditioners installed, he knew that Ayala was using them to\n\nconceal her drug money.\n\n                II.    ADMISSION OF SPECIFIC EVIDENCE\n\n           Evidence of the murders.           Appellants object to the\n\nadmission of specific pieces of evidence introduced at trial.\n\nMartinez argues that the evidence of the Bejumen and Vazquez\n\nmurders was unfairly prejudicial and irrelevant because they had\n\nno relationship to the drug conspiracy.          See Fed. R. Evid. 403;\n\nUnited States v. Gonsalves, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"398645\"><a href=\"/opinion/398645/united-states-v-john-gonsalves/\"><span class=\"volume\">668</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">73</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 75 (1st Cir. 1982).\n\n           To the contrary, the Garcias sought to kill Bejumen\n\nbecause he was associated with Gerardito, who had allegedly\n\nstolen from the Garcias' drug point.             Bejumen was apparently\n\nneither involved in the drug trade nor took any particular\n\nactions   to   threaten   the   Garcias's     drug     interests;       but   the\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fevidence revealed a pattern of murders originating in the drug\n\nconspiracy,    directed         against    mere   friends    and   relatives       of\n\nrivals,   which     the    jury    could     find   were    to   discourage       and\n\nundermine such rivals.\n\n          There was even more evidence presented at trial linking\n\nthe Vazquez murders to the drug conspiracy.                  While Bejumen may\n\nhave   been   killed      for    purely    retributive      reasons,      there    is\n\nsubstantial evidence that the Vazquezes posed a more immediate\n\nthreat to Garcias's future interests at La Cantera.                     After the\n\nfeud between Gerardito and the Garcias erupted, Michael Vazquez\n\nbegan to shoot at Gongolon's drug point at La Atocha and the\n\nGarcias' drug point at La Cantera, which depressed drug sales.\n\nThe Garcias thus targeted the Vazquezes not only to get back at\n\nGerardito,    but    to    protect        the   profitability      of   the     drug\n\nconspiracy.    The admission of the murders was relevant and not\n\nunfairly prejudicial.\n\n          Co-conspirator           hearsay      statements.        Much    of     the\n\ngovernment's      proof    rested     on    hearsay   statements        that    were\n\nadmitted in evidence under the co-conspirator exception, which\n\nexempts from the hearsay rule statements \"by a coconspirator of\n\na party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\"\n\nFed.

The district court found at the\n\nclose of the evidence that the statements more likely than not\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fsatisfied the requirements of the rule.

Id.\n\n            Six of the statements challenged by the appellants\n\neasily satisfy this requirement because they conveyed to other\n\nco-conspirators information about the operations of the drug\n\nconspiracy      centering     around    Ayala:     which    drug   points    Ayala\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\fsupplied,    the      means   by   which      she    retrieved      the     drugs   from\n\nJockey, and the role that Batiz played at La Cantera.

Eleizer was Gongolon's bodyguard and worked at his\n\ndrug point at Tibes.          Gongolon testified that he told Eleizer he\n\nwas upset with Orejon for trying to sell a stolen car at Tibes,\n\nfearing    it    would   \"heat     up\"    the   drug       point.      When    Eleizer\n\nresponded that he wanted to kill Orejon, Gongolon advised him to\n\nwait until Orejon left Tibes.              After the killing, Eleizer told\n\nGongolon how the shooting occurred.                    On this version of the\n\nfacts, Eleizer's statements to Gongolon were undoubtedly in\n\nfurtherance of their drug conspiracy, since he and Gongolon were\n\n\n\n\n                                         -18-\n\fdiscussing strategies for dealing with the threat posed by\n\nOrejon to the Tibes drug point.\n\n              Goglas, however, testified that Ayala had Eleizer kill\n\nOrejon because Orejon had stolen some jewelry and money from\n\nAyala's friend Jose Velazquez.            This version of the facts is\n\nfriendlier to the appellants, since it makes the murder--and\n\nconsequently Eleizer's admission to it--less clearly relevant to\n\nthe drug conspiracy.         Although there is scant evidence as to\n\nwhich version of the facts is accurate (perhaps both are), we\n\ncannot say that the district court clearly erred in concluding\n\nthat    Eleizer's    admissions    were    more    likely   than    not   in\n\nfurtherance of the drug conspiracy.\n\n              Moreover, even if there was error in admitting these\n\nfinal   two    statements,   it   was   patently   harmless.       Here   the\n\nevidence as to the appellants' participation in the conspiracies\n\nwas strong, and it is highly improbable that the statements\n\nabout Eleizer's role in a murder that was at best peripheral to\n\nthe prosecution's case affected the verdict.

The trouble with\n\nthis theory is that, as discussed in Part II above, the murders\n\nwere a legitimate part of the government's case because they\n\nwere overt acts of the conspiracy.\n\n          At several points, the prosecution appealed to the\n\njuror's \"hearts and minds\" and \"conscience.\"                 The prosecutor\n\ntold the jury that \"your conscience must have been screaming at\n\nyou,   screaming   at   you   that    [the    defendants]       were   guilty.\"\n\nLater, the prosecutor said that \"if you know in your head and\n\nyour heart that these defendants are guilty then you must return\n\nthe only verdict that the evidence commands.\"                These comments\n\nwere plainly improper appeals to the jury's emotions and role as\n\nthe conscience of the community.

Relying upon trial evidence, the court concluded that\n\nmore     than    150     kilograms        of   cocaine       were   involved       in   the\n\nconspiracy and fairly attributable to both Ayala and Perez.\n\n            This figure was far more than needed to trigger the\n\nstatutory maximum life sentence, 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A), and\n\nenough to set their guideline base offense levels at 38, the\n\nhighest unadjusted level for drug crimes, U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1\n\n(1998).         With a criminal history category of IV, Ayala was\n\ninitially subject to a 324 to 405 month sentence, and Perez,\n\nwith a criminal history category of III, was initially subject\n\nto   a   term     of   292     to   365    months.           U.S.S.G.   Ch.    5    Pt.    A\n\n(sentencing table).\n\n            However, the court found that life sentences were\n\nmandated in each case for at least two reasons.                          First, after\n\nmaking the requisite factual findings, the court applied two\n\nupward departures to each appellant's base offense level: a two-\n\nlevel     increase       for    possession        of     a    firearm,       U.S.S.G.      §\n\n2D1.1(b)(1), and a four-level increase for being an organizer or\n\n\n\n\n                                           -28-\n\fleader of the conspiracy, id. § 3B1.1.        With these enhancements,\n\nPerez and Ayala were subject to life terms.\n\n            Second, as an alternative, the court applied U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2D1.1(d)(1)'s murder cross reference, which says that \"[i]f a\n\nvictim was killed under circumstances that would constitute\n\nmurder under 18 U.S.C. § 1111\" the sentencing court shall apply\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2A1.1.      The court found, by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence, that Ayala was responsible for the murders of Joito el\n\nOrejon and Michael and Eddie Vazquez, and that Perez had ordered\n\nthe murder of Sol Garcia.       Accordingly, it increased their base\n\noffense levels to 43, as specified in section 2A1.1.           The pair\n\nwere again subject to life terms.\n\n            Third, the court determined that Ayala (but not Perez)\n\nwas subject to a mandatory life sentence under 21 U.S.C. §\n\n841(b)(1)(A) because she had two or more prior drug felony\n\nconvictions.\n\n            Finally, the court proceeded to sentence the appellants\n\non   the   money   laundering   count.   At   the   outset,   the   court\n\ndeclined to group the two counts of conviction under U.S.S.G. §\n\n3D1.2 since the drug offenses involved murder and thus distinct\n\nvictims and harms.      It then calculated a combined base offense\n\nlevel of 43 and applied it to the money laundering conviction.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3D1.4.     The court then imposed a sentence of 20 years\n\n\n                                  -29-\n\fon each Ayala and Perez, the maximum allowed by statute.                         18\n\nU.S.C. § 1956(a)(1).\n\n            First, Ayala and Perez say the district court violated\n\ntheir rights under Apprendi v.

The default statutory maximum\n\nfor the cocaine conspiracy would be 20 years if no quantity were\n\ndetermined; life imprisonment becomes the statute's maximum only\n\nwhere five kilograms or more is involved.                  Compare 21 U.S.C. §\n\n841(b)(1)(C) with id. § 841(b)(1)(A).                 Ayala and Perez say,\n\ncorrectly, that under Apprendi quantity determinations that push\n\nthe actual sentence imposed beyond the otherwise applicable\n\nstatutory    maximum      must   be    determined     by    a    jury   beyond    a\n\nreasonable doubt.\n\n            Although Ayala and Perez were sentenced in July and\n\nAugust of 1999, before Apprendi was decided in 2000, there is no\n\nbar to applying that decision now to their direct appeals.\n\nUnited States v.

On one\n\noccasion alone he handled 20 sacks of cocaine, each containing\n\nseveral kilograms of the drug.                Further, Victor Rodriguez,\n\nanother of Jockey's contacts, testified that Ayala received\n\ndrugs from air drops, each of which involved between 600 and\n\n1,000 kilograms of cocaine.           The record is replete with other\n\nexamples    as   well,   involving         Ayala,    Perez,    or    their     co-\n\nconspirators.6        Sepulveda,      15    F.3d     at    1197;    U.S.S.G.     §\n\n1B1.3(a)(1)(B).\n\n            Relying   upon    this    evidence,      the    sentencing       court\n\nultimately determined that the conspiracy involved more than 150\n\nkilograms of cocaine, or thirty times more than needed to impose\n\na   life   sentence   under   21     U.S.C.    §    841(b)(1)(A).       Neither\n\nappellant seriously denies that the conspiracy involved at least\n\nfive kilograms of cocaine.            In fact, Ayala makes no effort\n\n\n      6\n     For example, Danny Gongolon testified that he sold Ayala 37\nkilograms of cocaine between 1994 and 1995 and received more\nthan 10 kilograms from her on credit between 1995 and 1997.\n\n                                     -31-\n\fwhatsoever to undermine the accuracy of the sentencing court's\n\nfindings.    And Perez takes aim at the wrong target for Apprendi\n\npurposes--the 150 kilograms figure--conceding in his brief and\n\nat sentencing that he was responsible for more than 50 kilograms\n\nof cocaine.\n\n            Insofar as Perez attacks the district court's finding\n\nof drug amount as affecting the guidelines range, Apprendi is\n\nsimply beside the point.

Their argument is that the sentencing court\n\nagain violated Apprendi by finding, under a preponderance of the\n\nevidence standard, that they played a role in various conspiracy\n\nmurders,    thus    subjecting        them    to   life     imprisonment.      The\n\nargument fails, however, because               Apprendi does not apply to\n\nfindings made for purposes of the sentencing guidelines, such as\n\nthe court's determinations that the appellants were accountable\n\nfor the murders.

Ayala and Perez say that the murders are\n\nirrelevant to drug crime sentencing because neither U.S.S.G. §\n\n2A1.1   nor   the   cross-reference     table   in    Appendix   A   of   the\n\nGuideline Manual mentions the drug statutes.             To the contrary,\n\nthe murders can be taken into account when sentencing for the\n\ndrug crimes; U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1 explicitly cross-references the\n\nmurder provision of section 2A1.1.

Compare U.S.S.G. §\n\n2A1.1 (level 43) with id. § 2A1.2 (level 33).

Ayala's prior\n\nconvictions   stem    from    several    transactions,      occurring      over\n\nseveral months and involving different drugs.7                  There was no\n\nerror in treating these convictions as distinct.                 As the Ninth\n\nCircuit has reasoned:\n\n    An ongoing course of criminal conduct such as\n    narcotics trafficking may involve many such criminal\n    episodes, each a discrete occurrence. The fact that\n    all are related, part of a series, or part of a\n    continuous course of criminal dealing, does not\n    necessarily render them a 'single' criminal episode,\n    particularly where the episodes occur over time. To\n    so hold would insulate the very career criminals the\n    statute is designed to reach--those continuously\n    engaged in criminal conduct.\n\n\n\n    7 The Commonwealth levied four charges against Ayala for\ndistributing cocaine on at least four different dates between\nOctober 1990 and March 1991.        These charges were later\nconsolidated. The federal government, after conducting its own\ninvestigation, charged Ayala with distributing heroin as well,\napparently in or around July 1991, the date of her arrest for\nthat crime. She pled guilty to the charges and received a five-\nyear sentence on the Commonwealth charge(s), and a six-month\nsentence on the federal charge, to be served concurrently.\n\n                                      -34-\n\fUnited States v.

However, they misread the guidelines\n\nand the sentencing record.\n\n             It is quite true that if the money laundering count\n\nwere the only count of conviction, it would carry an adjusted\n\noffense level of 30, after factoring in various enhancements.\n\nThis, presumably, is the figure Ayala and Perez use to calculate\n\ntheir sentencing ranges.8          The difficulty with the argument is\n\nthat it ignores the manner in which the guidelines establish a\n\nsingle combined offense level for multiple-count convictions and\n\nuse   that    offense   level   for       sentencing   on   each     count   of\n\nconviction, subject to statutory maximums.\n\n             As already explained, the adjusted offense level for\n\nthe   drug   conspiracy    count    for    both   appellants   was    43   (the\n\nmaximum allowed).         U.S.S.G. § 3D1.4 provides a formula for\n\ncombining the offense level 43 and offense level 30 that results\n\nin a combined offense level for all counts of conviction of 43.\n\nThe district court applied this formula because it held that the\n\ndrug and money laundering convictions should not be grouped\n\ntogether under U.S.S.G. § 3D1.2--a judgment that Ayala and Perez\n\ndo not challenge and we need not independently address.               Compare\n\n\n      8\n     With a criminal history category of IV, Ayala would be\nsubject to a term of 135 to 168 months. Thus, it is unclear why\nshe claims that the appropriate range was 121 to 151 months;\nthis latter range applies to defendants, like Perez, with a\ncriminal history category III.\n\n                                     -37-\n\fUnited States v.

U.S.S.G.    §     5G1.2(b).          The    only    pertinent\n\nqualification is that the sentence not exceed the statutory\n\nmaximum for the relevant count.             Id. § 5G1.1(a).           It was for\n\nthat reason that despite the combined offense level of 43, the\n\ncourt limited the money laundering sentence to the statutory\n\nmaximum of 20 years.     See 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1).             Since the 20-\n\nyear sentence runs concurrently and is shorter than the life\n\nsentence, Ayala and Perez are not demonstrably worse off; but in\n\nany event the money laundering sentence is consistent with the\n\nexplicit directions of the guidelines.\n\n          Martinez's sentencing claims.             Martinez was the first\n\nof the appellants to be sentenced, in late May 1999, and his\n\nproceeding differed slightly from that of Ayala and Perez.                     The\n\ncourt first found that Martinez had participated in the murders\n\nof Bejumen and his wife.           Applying the cross-reference to the\n\nmurder provision of the guidelines, U.S.S.G. § 2A1.1, the court\n\ncalculated Martinez's base offense level at 43.                It then granted\n\nhim a two-level downward departure for being a minor participant\n\nin the conspiracy, reducing his offense level to 41.                      With a\n\n                                     -38-\n\fcriminal   history    category   of   I,   Martinez   was    subject   to   a\n\nguideline sentencing range of 324 to 405 months, and the court\n\nimposed the maximum sentence within that range.\n\n           Notably,    the    sentencing    court     made    no   findings\n\nconcerning drug quantity at the hearing; instead, it merely\n\nrecited that the jury had found Martinez guilty of conspiracy to\n\ndistribute \"multi kilo quantities of drugs.\"           This was arguably\n\nerror under the guidelines, because absent any drug quantity\n\ndetermination, the maximum statutory sentence applicable to\n\nMartinez's crime was 20 years and he was given nearly 34 years.\n\nSee U.S.S.G. § 5G1.1.        Martinez, however, did not object to the\n\nerror at sentencing.      And in his second supplemental brief in\n\nthis court, he concedes several times that he was responsible\n\nfor more than 500 grams of cocaine, thus exposing him to a\n\nsentencing range of five to 40 years.9\n\n           Martinez did make two objections at sentencing: first,\n\nthat he was being sentenced for a crime (murder) for which he\n\nwas neither charged nor convicted.          On appeal, he renews this\n\nclaim under the guise of Apprendi, suggesting, as do Ayala and\n\n\n\n    9The district court would have had no difficulty finding\nMartinez responsible for over 500 grams of cocaine. Martinez\nwas familiar with the Garcia drug point, which involved large\nquantities of cocaine, and the drug point transactions were\nforeseeable acts in the conspiracy Martinez joined through the\nmurder of Bejumen and his wife. See Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1197.\n\n                                   -39-\n\fPerez, that application of the cross-reference violates his due\n\nprocess rights.        But Martinez's concession as to drug quantity\n\nis fatal to this claim of error.            The sentence he received was\n\nbelow the statutory maximum of 40 years; as explained above,\n\nApprendi is not implicated.\n\n            Second,      Martinez    made      a       truncated    argument     at\n\nsentencing concerning the sufficiency of the evidence of his\n\nparticipation in the murders.            On appeal, he says the evidence\n\nof the murder was inconsistent.          Even assuming this argument was\n\nfully preserved--which is doubtful--our review is only for clear\n\nerror    because       Apprendi     is   not       implicated       (the     murder\n\ndetermination affected only the guidelines determination, not\n\nthe statutory maximum).           The district court heard admissible\n\nhearsay evidence at trial directly implicating Martinez in the\n\nmurder; the hearsay was broadly consistent with an eyewitness\n\naccount of the murders; we can hardly say it was clear error for\n\nthe court to credit that evidence.

Here we discern no possibility of\n\nprejudice in either case.\n\n           Martinez’s Brady argument is based on a sworn statement\n\nin which Jaime Rivera-Morales, a former Puerto Rico police\n\nofficer, admits to being one of the \"police officers\" who helped\n\nkidnap the Vazquezes but states that the murder was arranged by\n\nJose Galiany on behalf of Santos Martinez, a drug dealer with no\n\napparent     connection     to   the    Garcias.      The    statement    was\n\ndiscovered after the verdict in this case, during a preliminary\n\nhearing in the Commonwealth trial of Manuel Garcia and Ventura\n\nfor the Vazquez murders.          Martinez says this statement could\n\n\n                                       -42-\n\fhave been used to impeach the credibility of Gongolon, and more\n\nimportantly,         Goglas,     who   was    the     main   witness       implicating\n\nMartinez in Bejumen's murder.\n\n            Wrongly withheld impeachment evidence, if powerful\n\nenough, can be prejudicial and grounds for a new trial.

This is particularly\n\ntrue   where     the    evidence       is    highly      impeaching    or    when    the\n\nwitness'    testimony       is    uncorroborated          and    essential     to    the\n\nconviction.

Such weak impeachment evidence on an issue tangential\n\nto the conviction is not sufficient to warrant the drastic\n\nremedy of a new trial.

Perez points to\n\na report prepared by DEA Agent Clifford memorializing several\n\ninterviews       with    Samuel     Arce-Leon,    a    cooperating        government\n\ninformant.       According to one of the reports, Arce stated that he\n\noverheard a conversation between other drug dealers who said\n\nthat Ayala ordered Ricardo Carrasquillo and another individual\n\nto murder Sol Garcia because she wanted to take over the Los\n\nLirios del Sur drug point.             According to Arce, Ayala and Perez\n\nthen    took    over    the   drug   point.       Perez      claims      that   Arce's\n\ntestimony is corroborated by eyewitness testimony regarding the\n\nphysical appearance of the killers.10\n\n               Even taking the evidence most favorably to Perez, it\n\ndoes    not     undermine     our    confidence       in    his   drug    conspiracy\n\nconviction.          Perez's participation in Sol Garcia's murder was\n\nhardly important to the jury’s drug conspiracy verdict given the\n\noverwhelming evidence--including testimony of other witnesses\n\nand physical evidence such as drug ledgers--that Perez helped\n\nAyala retrieve drugs from Jockey and ran the Los Lirios del Sur\n\nand Santo Iglesias drug points.              Cf. Strickler, 527 U.S. at 294.\n\n\n       10\n      This eyewitness testified that two men--one light-skinned\nand one dark-skinned--killed Sol Garcia; Sanchez-Ortiz testified\nthat both men were dark-skinned. Since Carrasquillo is white,\nthe testimony lends some support to Arce's version of the\nevents.\n\n                                        -44-\n\f           The    Sol    Garcia     murder    had   more   relevance      in   the\n\nsentencing    phase,      where     the    district   court   cited    Perez's\n\ninvolvement to trigger a life sentence under U.S.S.G. § 2A1.1,\n\nthe murder provision cross-referenced in U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(d).\n\nBut Arce's statement was disclosed before sentencing, and the\n\ndistrict   court,       after   a   full   hearing    in   which   both    Agent\n\nClifford and Arce          testified, nevertheless determined by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that Perez was implicated in\n\nGarcia's murder.\n\n           Apart from his Apprendi claim, Perez did not dispute\n\non appeal the sufficiency of the evidence implicating him in Sol\n\nGarcia's murder.        Even reading Perez's Brady claim generously as\n\nincluding an attack on the evidentiary basis for the sentence,\n\nwe cannot say that the district court's sentencing decision was\n\nclearly erroneous, especially given the ambiguities in Arce's\n\nstatement.

Antonelli Fireworks Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1563658\"><a href=\"/opinion/1563658/united-states-v-antonelli-fireworks-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">155</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">631</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 661 (2d Cir.\n\n1946) (Frank, J., dissenting).               A tonic more potent than our\n\nwritten rebukes appears necessary.\n\n             Thus, I believe it is critical to emphasize a point\n\nthat   our        prior   condemnations       have    perhaps     overlooked.\n\nStatements such as the ones found in this case are not merely\n\npassages     in    a   trial   transcript     that   constitute   fodder   for\n\narguments on appeal.           They are instances of unethical behavior\n\nthat virtually all sources of authority condemn with a single\n\n\n                                      -48-\n\fvoice.    See ABA Standards for Criminal Justice § 3-5.8 (3d ed.\n\n1993); Model Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 3.4(e); Code of\n\nProfessional Responsibility, DR 7-106(C); Restatement (Third)\n\nThe Law Governing Lawyers, § 107 (2000).            It is well established\n\nthat district courts have, as a component of their inherent\n\npowers,   the     authority   to   sanction    such   unethical     behavior.\n\nUnited States v. Kourí-Pérez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198454\"><a href=\"/opinion/198454/united-states-v-kouri-perez/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7 (1st Cir. 1999).                I\n\nwould therefore urge our district courts to take a conscientious\n\nrole in addressing prosecutorial misconduct in the same manner\n\nthat they would address other forms of ethical misconduct: by\n\nacting swiftly and decisively to sanction and deter it.                   See\n\nUnited States v. Doe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"513417\"><a href=\"/opinion/513417/united-states-v-john-doe-aka-rafael-segundo-crespo-herrera-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">860</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">488</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 492 (1st Cir. 1988) (\"Rather\n\nthan reversal on appeal, the proper remedy would have been a\n\nreprimand    or    the   imposition    of    sanctions   by   the    district\n\ncourt.\").\n\n            Prosecutorial misconduct erodes our confidence in the\n\nvery government entities charged with protecting the public's\n\ninterests    through     enforcement    of    our   laws.     Moreover,    by\n\npresenting this Court time and again with convictions tarnished\n\nby misconduct, prosecutors breed further cynicism by asking us\n\nto affirm these convictions on harmless-error grounds.                    The\n\noverall effect is one that impugns the dignity of both the\n\n\n\n\n                                    -49-\n\fexecutive and the judiciary.   Its pernicious results are a cause\n\nof concern for all of us.\n\n         Given the numerous rebukes from this Court, and the\n\napparent disregard they have been shown, federal prosecutors in\n\nPuerto Rico should now be on notice that I, for one, will review\n\nwith heightened scrutiny their claims of harmless error arising\n\nfrom prosecutorial misconduct.\n\n\n\n\n                               -50-\n\f</pre>",
