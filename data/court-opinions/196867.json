Dignity Viatical  Settlement Partners, L.P.\r                           \r\n\nand  Dignity Partners, Inc.  (collectively, \"Dignity\") appeal\r\n\nfrom a judgment in favor of Protective Life Insurance Company\r\n\nin the insurance  company's action for  rescission of a  life\r\n\ninsurance  policy.     The  district  court   held  that  the\r\n\nMassachusetts  incontestability statute,  Mass.  Gen. L.  ch.\r\n\n175,    132, does not bar an  action for rescission of a life\r\n\ninsurance  policy  for  fraud,  even though  the  action  was\r\n\ncommenced more  than two years  after the policy  was issued.\r\n\nAfter careful  deliberation, we  certify, on our  own motion,\r\n\ntwo questions concerning the contestability of life insurance\r\n\npolicies  under  Massachusetts  law to  the  Supreme Judicial\r\n\nCourt of Massachusetts.\r\n\n     On  September 24,  1991, Dennis  J. Sullivan  applied to\r\n\nProtective  Life for a life insurance policy in the amount of\r\n\n$100,000  with an annual premium  of $175.  Although Sullivan\r\n\nhad  been diagnosed a month  earlier as HIV  positive and had\r\n\nbegun  a course  of  treatment, he  falsely  stated that  his\r\n\nhealth was  \"excellent\", omitted  the names of  those doctors\r\n\nwho  knew of  his  affliction, and  said  he was  not  taking\r\n\nmedication  (when in fact he  was using AZT).   He authorized\r\n\nProtective Life  to conduct  medical tests, including  a test\r\n\nfor HIV  infection, but  on November  8, 1991,  the insurance\r\n\ncompany issued a policy to Sullivan without having ordered an\r\n\nHIV  test.  The policy  included an optional provision which,\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nfor  an  increase in  the annual  premium, gave  Sullivan the\r\n\nright to waive the premium in the event he became disabled.\r\n\n     In 1992, Sullivan's health worsened and by June 1992 his\r\n\nHIV  infection had  progressed to AIDS.   He  stopped working\r\n\naround this time  and applied in October  1992 for disability\r\n\nbenefits  from another  insurance  company.   But he  did not\r\n\napply to Protective Life  for a waiver of his  life insurance\r\n\npremiums  on account  of disability  until about  November 8,\r\n\n1993, exactly two years after the policy was issued.\r\n\n     In  October 1993,  Sullivan  contacted  National  Viator\r\n\nRepresentatives,  Inc.,  a  broker  of  viatical settlements,\r\n\nagreements  under which  an  insured sells  a life  insurance\r\n\npolicy for an immediate  payment approximating the discounted\r\n\nface value  of the  policy.   The broker  informed Protective\r\n\nLife that Sullivan wished to assign ownership of  his policy.\r\n\nSullivan  agreed  to assign  his  policy to  Dignity,  a firm\r\n\nengaged  in making  viatical  settlements.   On December  14,\r\n\n1993,  Dignity submitted  the assignment forms  to Protective\r\n\nLife.   Protective Life  approved the assignment  on December\r\n\n22, 1993, and on the same day Dignity paid Sullivan $73,000.\r\n\n     Massachusetts  law requires  life insurance  policies to\r\n\ninclude a  provision stating  that  the policy  shall not  be\r\n\ncontestable  after it has been  in effect for  two years from\r\n\nits date of issue, \r\n\n     except for  non-payment of premiums or  violation of the\r\n     conditions of  the policy relating to  military or naval\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\n     service in time  of war  and except, if  the company  so\r\n     elects, for  the purpose of contesting  claims for total\r\n     and permanent disability benefits or additional benefits\r\n     specifically granted in case of death by accident.\r\n\nMass.  Gen. L. ch. 175,    132.   Sullivan's insurance policy\r\n\ncontained  the  following  incontestability   provision:  \"We\r\n\ncannot bring any legal action to contest the validity of this\r\n\npolicy  after it  has  been in  force  two years  except  for\r\n\nfailure to pay premiums unless fraud is involved.\"  (emphasis\r                                                            \r\n\nadded).    Protective  Life  had submitted  the  policy  form\r\n\ncontaining  this provision to  the Massachusetts Commissioner\r\n\nof  Insurance, and the Commissioner had  approved the form on\r\n\nSeptember 18, 1988, saying that it \"appear[ed] to conform\" to\r\n\nMassachusetts insurance law.\r\n\n     Protective Life  filed suit on April 15, 1994 to rescind\r\n\nthe   policy  because   Sullivan  had  obtained   it  through\r\n\nfraudulent   misrepresentations.    It   is  undisputed  that\r\n\nSullivan knew he  was HIV  positive when he  applied for  the\r\n\nlife insurance policy, that he failed to disclose that he was\r\n\nseeing a  physician for  treatment of this  condition despite\r\n\nquestions  calling for this  information, and that Protective\r\n\nLife would not have issued the policy had it known Sullivan's\r\n\ntrue medical condition.\r\n\n     Dignity and  Sullivan moved to dismiss the action on the\r\n\nground that the provision allowing the company to contest the\r\n\npolicy  for fraud more than two years  from its date of issue\r\n\nwas  inconsistent with Mass.  Gen. L.  ch. 175,    132.   The\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\ndistrict  court  denied the  motion on  January 12,  1995 and\r\n\nsimilarly denied the subsequent motion for reconsideration on\r\n\nJune 9, 1995.   After a two-day bench trial,  the court ruled\r\n\nfrom  the bench  that state law  did not  bar the  action and\r\n\nentered  judgment for  Protective  Life  against  Dignity  on\r\n\nNovember 17, 1995.  Sullivan died of complications associated\r\n\nwith AIDS on  April 4, 1995, and the  claims against him were\r\n\ndismissed.\r\n\n     The  district  court found  no  clear  precedent on  the\r\n\nquestion whether section 132 permits a fraud exception to the\r\n\ntwo-year limitations  period  for contesting  life  insurance\r\n\npolicies.      The   court  held   that   the  Commissioner's\r\n\ninterpretation of  the statute,  implicit in the  approval of\r\n\nthe  policy form,  was entitled  to deference.   Finding  the\r\n\nstatute  silent on the precise issue, the court held that the\r\n\nCommissioner's decision to approve a policy form containing a\r\n\nfraud exception was reasonable, and therefore that Protective\r\n\nLife  could challenge the policy.   The court  found by clear\r\n\nand  convincing evidence  that Sullivan  committed  fraud and\r\n\nrescinded the policy.\r\n\n     On appeal, Dignity argues that section 132 should not be\r\n\nread to include a fraud exception.  Dignity further  contends\r\n\nthat the Commissioner's  approval of the policy  form was not\r\n\nentitled  to  deference  because  it  did  not  constitute  a\r\n\nmeaningful interpretation of  the statute.   Protective Life,\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nin response, asserts  that the Commissioner's  interpretation\r\n\nof  section  132 is  reasonable  and  entitled to  deference.\r\n\nProtective  Life also  argues  as an  alternative ground  for\r\n\naffirmance  that  the incontestability  period  was equitably\r\n\ntolled  because  Sullivan  concealed  his  misrepresentations\r\n\nthrough  his delay in applying  for a waiver  of premiums for\r\n\ndisability.\r\n\n     There  is  a  plausible  plain-language   argument  that\r\n\nsection  132 should not be read to include a fraud exception.\r\n\nThe statute expressly enumerates three exceptions to the two-\r\n\nyear  limitations period, and fraud  is not among  them.  The\r\n\nstatute  governing health  insurance  policies, in  contrast,\r\n\nstates  that the validity of  a policy may  be challenged for\r\n\nfraudulent  misstatements  in  the  application   beyond  the\r\n\nordinary incontestability  period.   Mass. Gen. L.  ch.175,  \r\n\n108(3)(a)(2).    Section  132   also  states  that  a  policy\r\n\nprovision that  \"is  stated in  terms more  favorable to  the\r\n\ninsured or  his beneficiary  than are  herein  set forth\"  is\r\n\nacceptable; Dignity argues that  a negative inference  should\r\n\nbe drawn from  this that  a provision less  favorable to  the\r\n\ninsured  violates  the  statute--and that  Protective  Life's\r\n\ninclusion  of  the  fraud  exception  in  its  contestability\r\n\nprovision makes the policy less favorable.\r\n\n     The  interpretation  of   section  132  is  complicated,\r\n\nhowever,  by  its   relationship  to  another   provision  of\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\nMassachusetts insurance law,  Mass Gen.  L. ch.  175,    124.\r\n\nSection  124 provides  that in  claims  arising under  a life\r\n\ninsurance  policy issued  without  a medical  examination  or\r\n\nwithout knowledge and consent of the insured,\r\n\n     the statements  made in the  application as to  the age,\r\n     physical condition  and  family history  of the  insured\r\n     shall  be held to be  valid and binding  on the company;\r\n     but  the company shall not be debarred from proving as a\r\n     defense to such claim that said statements were wilfully\r\n     false, fraudulent or misleading.\r\n\nOn Dignity's  reading, section  124 operates only  during the\r\n\ntwo- year period for contesting the policy under section 132,\r\n\nand  makes it  more  difficult to  rescind  certain types  of\r\n\npolicies  (those  issued without  an  examination  or without\r\n\nknowledge  and  consent)  during  that  time.    Section  124\r\n\nrequires proof  of fraud, while policies outside the scope of\r\n\nsection 124 may be rescinded on a showing of material factual\r\n\ninaccuracy, see Mass.  Gen. L.  ch. 175,    186.   Protective\r                           \r\n\nLife  argues to  the contrary  that section  124 contains  no\r\n\nexpress  time  limitation and  creates  an  exception to  the\r\n\nordinary  two-year  time limit  for  policies  issued without\r\n\nexamination  or  consent,  allowing  insurance  companies  to\r\n\ncontest such policies for fraud at any time.\r\n\n     This  case presents  a question  of first  impression in\r\n\nMassachusetts.  In Bonitz  v. Travelers Ins. Co., 372  N.E.2d\r                                                            \r\n\n254 (Mass. 1978),  the court  observed that  section 132  \"is\r\n\ndesigned to require  the insurer to investigate and  act with\r\n\nreasonable promptness if  it wishes to deny  liability on the\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\nground of  false representation or warranty  by the insured.\"\r\n\nId.  at 256 (quoting Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. De Nicola,\r                                                                        \r\n\n58 N.E.2d 841, 842 (Mass. 1944)).

Decisions  in other  jurisdictions on  fraud\r\n\nexceptions  to  incontestability  statutes have  been  mixed,\r\n\ncompare  Amex Life Ins. Co.  v. Slome Capital  Corp., 43 Cal.\r                                                                \r\n\nApp.  4th 1588, 1605-07  (Cal. App.  1996), with  Fioretti v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nMassachusetts General  Life Ins.  Co., 53 F.3d  1228, 1236-37\r                                                 \r\n\n(11th  Cir.  1995),  cert.  denied,  116 S.  Ct.  708  (1996)\r                                              \r\n\n(construing  New Jersey  law), and  none  has dealt  with the\r\n\ninteraction between  two provisions analogous to sections 124\r\n\nand 132.\r\n\n     Protective Life  offers the  canon of  construction that\r\n\nthe specific  controls the general,  but that  rule does  not\r\n\nhelp  in  this case  because  both  statutory provisions  are\r\n\nspecific in different ways.  Section 132  states clearly that\r\n\nthere  is a two-year time limit on contesting the validity of\r\n\nlife insurance policies.   Section 124 says, equally clearly,\r\n\nthat  particular types  of policies--those  issued without  a\r\n\nmedical examination or knowledge and consent of the insured--\r\n\nmay be contested for fraud, without specifying a time  limit.\r\n\nAs a  matter of policy,  Protective Life claims  that section\r\n\n124  was enacted to encourage the  issuance of life insurance\r\n\npolicies  cheaply and quickly, without a medical examination.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\nDignity asserts to the  contrary that the provision disfavors\r                                                                         \r\n\nsuch  policies  by making  it  more  difficult for  insurance\r\n\ncompanies to contest them during the two-year  contestability\r\n\nperiod.  Neither  party has presented  persuasive legislative\r\n\nhistory on the point.\r\n\n     The subsidiary question of the weight to be  accorded to\r\n\nthe Commissioner's  action in  clearing the policy  form also\r\n\nappears  to   be  open   to  dispute.     The  Commissioner's\r\n\ninterpretation of Massachusetts insurance law may be entitled\r\n\nto deference  even when the interpretation  is evidenced only\r\n\nby  approval of  a policy  form.   See Colby  v. Metropolitan\r                                                                         \r\n\nProperty and Cas. Ins. Co., 652 N.E.2d 128, 131 (Mass. 1995).\r                                      \r\n\nThe district court found that the Commissioner has determined\r\n\nthat there  is an implicit exception  to the incontestability\r\n\nclause for  actual, willful fraud and  has routinely approved\r\n\nlife insurance policies with such an exception.  If, however,\r\n\nthe Commissioner's interpretation is contrary to the language\r\n\nand  policy of the statute, it will not be deemed persuasive.\r\n\nCardin  v. Royal  Ins.

(collectively, \"Dignity\") appeal from a judgment in favor of Protective Life Insurance Company in the insurance company's action for rescission of a life insurance policy.   The district court held that the Massachusetts incontestability statute, Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 175, &#167; 132, does not bar an action for rescission of a life insurance policy for fraud, even though the action was commenced more than two years after the policy was issued.   After careful deliberation, we certify, on our own motion, two questions concerning the contestability of life insurance policies under Massachusetts law to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 24, 1991, Dennis J. Sullivan applied to Protective Life for a life insurance policy in the amount of $100,000 with an annual premium of $175.   Although Sullivan had been diagnosed a month earlier as HIV positive and had begun a course of treatment, he falsely stated that his health was \"excellent\", omitted the names of those doctors who knew of his affliction, and said he was not taking medication (when in fact he was using AZT).   He authorized Protective Life to conduct medical tests, including a test for HIV infection, but on November 8, 1991, the insurance company issued a policy to Sullivan without having ordered an HIV test.   The policy included an optional provision which, for an increase in the annual premium, gave Sullivan the right to waive the premium in the event he became disabled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1992, Sullivan's health worsened and by June 1992 his HIV infection had progressed to AIDS.  He stopped working around this time and applied in October 1992 for disability benefits from another insurance company.   But he did not apply to Protective Life for a waiver of his life insurance premiums on account of disability until about November 8, 1993, exactly two years after the policy was issued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1993, Sullivan contacted National Viator Representatives, Inc., a broker of viatical settlements, agreements under which an insured sells a life insurance policy for an immediate payment approximating the discounted face value of the policy.   The broker informed Protective Life that Sullivan wished to assign ownership of his policy.   Sullivan agreed to assign his policy to Dignity, a firm engaged in making viatical settlements.   On December 14, 1993, Dignity submitted the assignment forms to Protective Life.  Protective Life approved the assignment on December 22, 1993, and on the same day Dignity paid Sullivan $73,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts law requires life insurance policies to include a provision stating that the policy shall not be contestable after it has been in effect for two years from its date of issue,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>except for non-payment of premiums or violation of the conditions of the policy relating to military or naval service in time of war and except, if the company so elects, for the purpose of contesting claims for total and permanent disability benefits or additional benefits specifically granted in case of death by accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass. Gen. L. ch. 175, &#167; 132.   Sullivan's insurance policy contained the following incontestability provision:  \"We cannot bring any legal action to contest the validity of this policy after it has been in force two years except for failure to pay premiums unless fraud is involved.\"  (emphasis added).   Protective Life had submitted the policy form containing this provision to the Massachusetts Commissioner of Insurance, and the Commissioner had approved the form on September 18, 1988, saying that it \"appear[ed] to conform\" to Massachusetts insurance law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Protective Life filed suit on April 15, 1994 to rescind the policy because Sullivan had obtained it through fraudulent misrepresentations.   It is undisputed that Sullivan knew he was HIV positive when he applied for the life insurance policy, that he failed to disclose that he was seeing a physician for treatment of this condition despite questions calling for this information, and that Protective Life would not have issued the policy had it known Sullivan's true medical condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dignity and Sullivan moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the provision allowing the company to contest the policy for fraud more than two years from its date of issue was inconsistent with Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 175, &#167; 132.   The district court denied the motion on January 12, 1995 and similarly denied the subsequent motion for reconsideration on June 9, 1995.   After a two-day bench trial, the court ruled from the bench that state law did not bar the action and entered judgment for Protective Life against Dignity on November 17, 1995.   Sullivan died of complications associated with AIDS on April 4, 1995, and the claims against him were dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found no clear precedent on the question whether section 132 permits a fraud exception to the two-year limitations period for contesting life insurance policies.   The court held that the Commissioner's interpretation of the statute, implicit in the approval of the policy form, was entitled to deference.   Finding the statute silent on the precise issue, the court held that the Commissioner's decision to approve a policy form containing a fraud exception was reasonable, and therefore that Protective Life could challenge the policy.   The court found by clear and convincing evidence that Sullivan committed fraud and rescinded the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Dignity argues that section 132 should not be read to include a fraud exception.   Dignity further contends that the Commissioner's approval of the policy form was not entitled to deference because it did not constitute a meaningful interpretation of the statute.   Protective Life, in response, asserts that the Commissioner's interpretation of section 132 is reasonable and entitled to deference.   Protective Life also argues as an alternative ground for affirmance that the incontestability period was equitably tolled because Sullivan concealed his misrepresentations through his delay in applying for a waiver of premiums for disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a plausible plain-language argument that section 132 should not be read to include a fraud exception.   The statute expressly enumerates three exceptions to the two-year limitations period, and fraud is not among them.   The statute governing health insurance policies, in contrast, states that the validity of a policy may be challenged for fraudulent misstatements in the application beyond the ordinary incontestability period.   Mass. Gen. L. ch.175, &#167; 108(3)(a)(2).   Section 132 also states that a policy provision that \"is stated in terms more favorable to the insured or his beneficiary than are herein set forth\" is acceptable;  Dignity argues that a negative inference should be drawn from this that a provision less favorable to the insured violates the statute--and that Protective Life's inclusion of the fraud exception in its contestability provision makes the policy less favorable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The interpretation of section 132 is complicated, however, by its relationship to another provision of Massachusetts insurance law, Mass Gen. L. ch. 175, &#167; 124.   Section 124 provides that in claims arising under a life insurance policy issued without a medical examination or without knowledge and consent of the insured,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>the statements made in the application as to the age, physical condition and family history of the insured shall be held to be valid and binding on the company;  but the company shall not be debarred from proving as a defense to such claim that said statements were wilfully false, fraudulent or misleading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Dignity's reading, section 124 operates only during the two-year period for contesting the policy under section 132, and makes it more difficult to rescind certain types of policies (those issued without an examination or without knowledge and consent) during that time.   Section 124 requires proof of fraud, while policies outside the scope of section 124 may be rescinded on a showing of material factual inaccuracy, see Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 175, &#167; 186.   Protective Life argues to the contrary that section 124 contains no express time limitation and creates an exception to the ordinary two-year time limit for policies issued without examination or consent, allowing insurance companies to contest such policies for fraud at any time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case presents a question of first impression in Massachusetts.   In Bonitz v. Travelers Ins. Co., 374 Mass. 327, 372 N.E.2d 254 (1978), the court observed that section 132 \"is designed to require the insurer to investigate and act with reasonable promptness if it wishes to deny liability on the ground of false representation or warranty by the insured.\"  Id. 372 N.E.2d at 256 (quoting Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. De Nicola, 317 Mass. 416, 58 N.E.2d 841, 842 (1944)).   But Bonitz did not concern the validity of an exception for fraud and so does not control here.   Decisions in other jurisdictions on fraud exceptions to incontestability statutes have been mixed, compare Amex Life Assurance Co. v. Slome Capital Corp., 43 Cal.App.4th 1588, 1605-07, 51 Cal.Rptr.2d 354 (1996), with Fioretti v. Massachusetts General Life Ins. Co., 53 F.3d 1228, 1236-37 (11th Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 708, 133 L.Ed.2d 663 (1996) (construing New Jersey law), and none has dealt with the interaction between two provisions analogous to sections 124 and 132.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Protective Life offers the canon of construction that the specific controls the general, but that rule does not help in this case because both statutory provisions are specific in different ways.   Section 132 states clearly that there is a two-year time limit on contesting the validity of life insurance policies.   Section 124 says, equally clearly, that particular types of policies--those issued without a medical examination or knowledge and consent of the insured--may be contested for fraud, without specifying a time limit.   As a matter of policy, Protective Life claims that section 124 was enacted to encourage the issuance of life insurance policies cheaply and quickly, without a medical examination.   Dignity asserts to the contrary that the provision disfavors such policies by making it more difficult for insurance companies to contest them during the two-year contestability period.   Neither party has presented persuasive legislative history on the point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The subsidiary question of the weight to be accorded to the Commissioner's action in clearing the policy form also appears to be open to dispute.   The Commissioner's interpretation of Massachusetts insurance law may be entitled to deference even when the interpretation is evidenced only by approval of a policy form.   See Colby v. Metropolitan Property and Cas. Ins. Co., 420 Mass. 799, 652 N.E.2d 128, 131 (1995).   The district court found that the Commissioner has determined that there is an implicit exception to the incontestability clause for actual, willful fraud and has routinely approved life insurance policies with such an exception.   If, however, the Commissioner's interpretation is contrary to the language and policy of the statute, it will not be deemed persuasive.  Cardin v. Royal Ins. Co. of America, 394 Mass. 450, 476 N.E.2d 200, 205 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Protective Life further argues that the two-year time limit should be equitably tolled because Sullivan not only committed fraud in his application, but also concealed the fraud by deliberately waiting to apply for the disability waiver of his premium until the incontestability period expired.   This argument also raises a difficult question of Massachusetts law.   There is no clear precedent on the question whether the time limit in section 132 is subject to equitable tolling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if in some cases the time limit could be tolled, the facts in this case present a further question:  the only act of concealment asserted as a ground for equitable tolling is Sullivan's delay in applying for his disability waiver.   The district court found that this delay amounted to an ongoing course of fraudulent conduct designed to conceal the fraud in the application.   Dignity denies that Sullivan deliberately delayed his application and denies that such inaction, even if deliberate, could give rise to equitable tolling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On our own motion, we certify to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, pursuant to its Rule 1:03, the questions set forth in the attached certificate, and we retain jurisdiction over this case pending their determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CERTIFICATION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons discussed in our opinion in this case, we certify to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, pursuant to its Rule 1:03, the following questions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>1.  Does Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 175, &#167; 132, taken together with &#167; 124, bar an insurance company from contesting the validity of a life insurance policy more than two years after its date of issue on the ground that the insured made fraudulent misrepresentations in applying for the policy, where the policy provided that it was contestable for fraud at any time and where the Massachusetts Commissioner of Insurance approved the policy form?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>2. If the incontestability statute bars such an action, is the contestability period nonetheless equitably tolled under the circumstances of this case by Sullivan's failure to apply for the disability waiver to which he was entitled until two years after the policy was issued?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we have framed the questions for the Supreme Judicial Court, we would welcome discussion by that court on any other issue of Massachusetts law material to the case.

The policy included an optional provision which, for an increase in the annual premium, gave Sullivan the right to waive the premium in the event he became disabled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1992, Sullivan's health worsened and by June 1992 his HIV infection had progressed to AIDS.  He stopped working around this time and applied in October 1992 for disability benefits from another insurance company.   But he did not apply to Protective Life for a waiver of his life insurance premiums on account of disability until about November 8, 1993, exactly two years after the policy was issued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1993, Sullivan contacted National Viator Representatives, Inc., a broker of viatical settlements, agreements under which an insured sells a life insurance policy for an immediate payment approximating the discounted face value of the policy.   The broker informed Protective Life that Sullivan wished to assign ownership of his policy.   Sullivan agreed to assign his policy to Dignity, a firm engaged in making viatical settlements.   On December 14, 1993, Dignity submitted the assignment forms to Protective Life.  Protective Life approved the assignment on December 22, 1993, and on the same day Dignity paid Sullivan $73,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts law requires life insurance policies to include a provision stating that the policy shall not be contestable after it has been in effect for two years from its date of issue,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>except for non-payment of premiums or violation of the conditions of the policy relating to military or naval service in time of war and except, if the company so elects, for the purpose of contesting claims for total and permanent disability benefits or additional benefits specifically granted in case of death by accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass. Gen. L. ch. 175, &#167; 132.   Sullivan's insurance policy contained the following incontestability provision:  \"We cannot bring any legal action to contest the validity of this policy after it has been in force two years except for failure to pay premiums unless fraud is involved.\"  (emphasis added).   Protective Life had submitted the policy form containing this provision to the Massachusetts Commissioner of Insurance, and the Commissioner had approved the form on September 18, 1988, saying that it \"appear[ed] to conform\" to Massachusetts insurance law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Protective Life filed suit on April 15, 1994 to rescind the policy because Sullivan had obtained it through fraudulent misrepresentations.   It is undisputed that Sullivan knew he was HIV positive when he applied for the life insurance policy, that he failed to disclose that he was seeing a physician for treatment of this condition despite questions calling for this information, and that Protective Life would not have issued the policy had it known Sullivan's true medical condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dignity and Sullivan moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the provision allowing the company to contest the policy for fraud more than two years from its date of issue was inconsistent with Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 175, &#167; 132.   The district court denied the motion on January 12, 1995 and similarly denied the subsequent motion for reconsideration on June 9, 1995.   After a two-day bench trial, the court ruled from the bench that state law did not bar the action and entered judgment for Protective Life against Dignity on November 17, 1995.   Sullivan died of complications associated with AIDS on April 4, 1995, and the claims against him were dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found no clear precedent on the question whether section 132 permits a fraud exception to the two-year limitations period for contesting life insurance policies.   The court held that the Commissioner's interpretation of the statute, implicit in the approval of the policy form, was entitled to deference.   Finding the statute silent on the precise issue, the court held that the Commissioner's decision to approve a policy form containing a fraud exception was reasonable, and therefore that Protective Life could challenge the policy.   The court found by clear and convincing evidence that Sullivan committed fraud and rescinded the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Dignity argues that section 132 should not be read to include a fraud exception.   Dignity further contends that the Commissioner's approval of the policy form was not entitled to deference because it did not constitute a meaningful interpretation of the statute.   Protective Life, in response, asserts that the Commissioner's interpretation of section 132 is reasonable and entitled to deference.   Protective Life also argues as an alternative ground for affirmance that the incontestability period was equitably tolled because Sullivan concealed his misrepresentations through his delay in applying for a waiver of premiums for disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a plausible plain-language argument that section 132 should not be read to include a fraud exception.   The statute expressly enumerates three exceptions to the two-year limitations period, and fraud is not among them.   The statute governing health insurance policies, in contrast, states that the validity of a policy may be challenged for fraudulent misstatements in the application beyond the ordinary incontestability period.   Mass. Gen. L. ch.175, &#167; 108(3)(a)(2).   Section 132 also states that a policy provision that \"is stated in terms more favorable to the insured or his beneficiary than are herein set forth\" is acceptable;  Dignity argues that a negative inference should be drawn from this that a provision less favorable to the insured violates the statute--and that Protective Life's inclusion of the fraud exception in its contestability provision makes the policy less favorable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The interpretation of section 132 is complicated, however, by its relationship to another provision of Massachusetts insurance law, Mass Gen. L. ch. 175, &#167; 124.   Section 124 provides that in claims arising under a life insurance policy issued without a medical examination or without knowledge and consent of the insured,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>the statements made in the application as to the age, physical condition and family history of the insured shall be held to be valid and binding on the company;  but the company shall not be debarred from proving as a defense to such claim that said statements were wilfully false, fraudulent or misleading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Dignity's reading, section 124 operates only during the two-year period for contesting the policy under section 132, and makes it more difficult to rescind certain types of policies (those issued without an examination or without knowledge and consent) during that time.   Section 124 requires proof of fraud, while policies outside the scope of section 124 may be rescinded on a showing of material factual inaccuracy, see Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 175, &#167; 186.   Protective Life argues to the contrary that section 124 contains no express time limitation and creates an exception to the ordinary two-year time limit for policies issued without examination or consent, allowing insurance companies to contest such policies for fraud at any time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case presents a question of first impression in Massachusetts.   In Bonitz v. Travelers Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2052348\"><a href=\"/opinion/2052348/bonitz-v-travelers-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">374</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">327</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2052348\"><a href=\"/opinion/2052348/bonitz-v-travelers-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">372</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></a></span> (1978), the court observed that section 132 \"is designed to require the insurer to investigate and act with reasonable promptness if it wishes to deny liability on the ground of false representation or warranty by the insured.\"  Id. 372 N.E.2d at 256 (quoting Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. De Nicola, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">317</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">416</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">841</span></span>, 842 (1944)).   But Bonitz did not concern the validity of an exception for fraud and so does not control here.   Decisions in other jurisdictions on fraud exceptions to incontestability statutes have been mixed, compare Amex Life Assurance Co. v. Slome Capital Corp., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1588</span></span>, 1605-07, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">663</span></span> (1996) (construing New Jersey law), and none has dealt with the interaction between two provisions analogous to sections 124 and 132.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Protective Life offers the canon of construction that the specific controls the general, but that rule does not help in this case because both statutory provisions are specific in different ways.   Section 132 states clearly that there is a two-year time limit on contesting the validity of life insurance policies.   Section 124 says, equally clearly, that particular types of policies--those issued without a medical examination or knowledge and consent of the insured--may be contested for fraud, without specifying a time limit.   As a matter of policy, Protective Life claims that section 124 was enacted to encourage the issuance of life insurance policies cheaply and quickly, without a medical examination.   Dignity asserts to the contrary that the provision disfavors such policies by making it more difficult for insurance companies to contest them during the two-year contestability period.   Neither party has presented persuasive legislative history on the point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The subsidiary question of the weight to be accorded to the Commissioner's action in clearing the policy form also appears to be open to dispute.   The Commissioner's interpretation of Massachusetts insurance law may be entitled to deference even when the interpretation is evidenced only by approval of a policy form.   See Colby v. Metropolitan Property and Cas. Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">799</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">652</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></span>, 131 (1995).   The district court found that the Commissioner has determined that there is an implicit exception to the incontestability clause for actual, willful fraud and has routinely approved life insurance policies with such an exception.   If, however, the Commissioner's interpretation is contrary to the language and policy of the statute, it will not be deemed persuasive.  Cardin v. Royal Ins. Co. of America, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2028966\"><a href=\"/opinion/2028966/cardin-v-royal-ins-co-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">450</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2028966\"><a href=\"/opinion/2028966/cardin-v-royal-ins-co-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span>, 205 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Protective Life further argues that the two-year time limit should be equitably tolled because Sullivan not only committed fraud in his application, but also concealed the fraud by deliberately waiting to apply for the disability waiver of his premium until the incontestability period expired.   This argument also raises a difficult question of Massachusetts law.   There is no clear precedent on the question whether the time limit in section 132 is subject to equitable tolling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if in some cases the time limit could be tolled, the facts in this case present a further question:  the only act of concealment asserted as a ground for equitable tolling is Sullivan's delay in applying for his disability waiver.   The district court found that this delay amounted to an ongoing course of fraudulent conduct designed to conceal the fraud in the application.   Dignity denies that Sullivan deliberately delayed his application and denies that such inaction, even if deliberate, could give rise to equitable tolling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On our own motion, we certify to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, pursuant to its Rule 1:03, the questions set forth in the attached certificate, and we retain jurisdiction over this case pending their determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CERTIFICATION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons discussed in our opinion in this case, we certify to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, pursuant to its Rule 1:03, the following questions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>1.  Does Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 175, &#167; 132, taken together with &#167; 124, bar an insurance company from contesting the validity of a life insurance policy more than two years after its date of issue on the ground that the insured made fraudulent misrepresentations in applying for the policy, where the policy provided that it was contestable for fraud at any time and where the Massachusetts Commissioner of Insurance approved the policy form?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>2. If the incontestability statute bars such an action, is the contestability period nonetheless equitably tolled under the circumstances of this case by Sullivan's failure to apply for the disability waiver to which he was entitled until two years after the policy was issued?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we have framed the questions for the Supreme Judicial Court, we would welcome discussion by that court on any other issue of Massachusetts law material to the case.
