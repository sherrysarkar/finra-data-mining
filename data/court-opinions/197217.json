This  appeal from a decision of  the United\r                           \r\n\nStates  Tax Court finds its  origin in a  dispute between the\r\n\nappellants,  Mr.  and Mrs.  John  T.  Barrett, Jr.,  and  the\r\n\nInternal Revenue  Service  (\"IRS\")  over  the  Barretts'  tax\r\n\nliability for the  years 1989 and 1990.   On March  24, 1993,\r\n\nthe IRS issued a notice of deficiency asserting  a deficiency\r\n\nof  $3,800.00 for  1989 and  a deficiency  of  $10,080.00 for\r\n\n1990.    In  addition,  the   IRS  asserted  accuracy-related\r\n\npenalties in the amount of $760.00 for 1989 and in the amount\r\n\nof $2,016.00  for 1990.   See  I.R.C.    6662.   Following  a\r                                         \r\n\ntrial,  the tax  court ruled  in favor  of the  IRS.   Having\r\n\nreviewed  the  record  and  the parties'  briefs,  we  affirm\r\n\nessentially  for the reasons stated  by the tax  court in its\r\n\nmemorandum  dated  April 24,  1996.    We add  the  following\r\n\ncomments.\r\n\n     The Barretts  argued below that they  suffered a capital\r\n\nloss in 1989--rather than the capital gain  determined by the\r\n\nIRS--because  the  subordinated note  (\"Note\")  given to  Mr.\r\n\nBarrett in 1989 by  Drexel Lambert Group, Inc.  (\"Drexel\") in\r\n\nconnection  with the  redemption of  his Drexel  stock became\r\n\nworthless  by the end of that year.  Although the Barretts do\r\n\nnot  press  on appeal  their  argument that  the  Note became\r\n\nworthless  in 1989, they do  argue that they  should not have\r\n\nbeen found  liable for an addition  to tax.   They admit that\r\n\ntheir 1989 tax return  contains a number of errors,  but they\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nargue  that   these  errors  are  excusable   and  that  they\r\n\nreasonably  determined the  Note to  be totally  worthless in\r\n\n1989.\r\n\n     We think  the tax  court  could properly  find that  the\r\n\nBarretts  were   negligent  in  maintaining  records  and  in\r\n\nproviding  information to  their tax  return preparer.   They\r\n\nfailed to supply  their tax preparer  with the correct  basis\r\n\nfor the Drexel shares.   They also failed to mention the Note\r\n\nto their tax preparer.  We are unpersuaded by their excuses.1\r                                                                        1\r\n\nSince  we do not think  the issue of  1989 worthlessness is a\r\n\nclose one, we  see no clear error in the  tax court's finding\r\n\nsustaining  the  accuracy-related  penalty on  the  ground of\r\n\nnegligence.  See Leuhsler v. Commissioner, 963 F.2d 907,  910\r                                                     \r\n\n(6th Cir.  1992) (observing  that a  tax court's  findings on\r\n\nnegligence issues are reviewed for clear error).  \r\n\n     The  Barretts contested the deficiency determination for\r\n\n1990  on  the ground  that they  are entitled  to a  bad debt\r\n\ndeduction for  that year.  See  I.R.C.   166.   To succeed on\r                                          \r\n\nthis contention, they  were required to  prove that the  Note\r\n\nbecame totally  worthless  in 1990.    Treas. Reg.     1.166-\r\n\n5(a)(2); Buchanan v. United States,  87 F.3d 197, 198-99 (7th\r                                              \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1We  note, in  particular,  that the  Barretts have  never\r               1\r\nadequately explained why they did not have (and keep) records\r\nof  the  amount they  paid  for the  stock.    Based on  such\r\nrecords, the  Barretts could  easily have supplied  their tax\r\npreparer with the correct basis of the stock.  \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nCir.), cert. denied,  117 S.  Ct. 363 (1996).   The  Barretts\r                               \r\n\nfailed to meet this burden.  \r\n\n     Drexel's filing for bankruptcy in 1990 is not enough, by\r\n\nitself,  to establish  that  the Note  became worthless  that\r\n\nyear.  See  Cox v. Commissioner, 68  F.3d 128, 131  (5th Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1995).   Rather, the question whether  any of Drexel's assets\r\n\nwould be available to pay the Note depends upon the value  of\r\n\nDrexel's assets,  the amount  and validity of  senior claims,\r\n\nand the cost of the bankruptcy administration.  See Dallmeyer\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Commissioner, 14 T.C. 1282, 1293 (1950).  We think the tax\r                           \r\n\ncourt  could properly find  that the Barretts  failed to show\r\n\nthese  latter factors  and  that the  record indicates  these\r\n\nfactors could not be determined with any degree of  certainty\r\n\nin 1990.  In short, the  Barretts failed to meet their burden\r\n\nof  showing that the facts and circumstances known at the end\r                                                                         \r\n\nof  1990 made it reasonable  to abandon hope  that they would\r                    \r\n\nrecover  something  on their  Note.   See  Estate of  Mann v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nUnited States, 731  F.2d 267,  278 (5th Cir.  1984) (\"If  and\r                         \r\n\nwhen  [a debt]  becomes wholly  worthless must  be determined\r\n\nfrom the  facts and  circumstances known or  which reasonably\r\n\ncould  have been  known at  the end of  the year  of asserted\r\n\nworthlessness.\").\r\n\n     The trial  testimony of  Andrew Rothenberg cited  by the\r\n\nBarretts does not  alter our  conclusion.  It  is plain  that\r\n\nRothenberg was  addressing the  prospects of recovery  on the\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nNote in 1992, when  the plan of reorganization  was proposed.\r\n\nBy then,  the largest  claims against the  Drexel estate  had\r\n\nbeen settled.  The  participants in the bankruptcy proceeding\r\n\npresumably  had   a  much  clearer  picture   of  the  assets\r\n\navailable, the claims  that would be allowed,  and the amount\r\n\nand  ranking of  claims.   Rothenberg  does  not address  the\r\n\nprospects   of  recovery   in   1990  based   on  facts   and\r\n\ncircumstances known (or  reasonably knowable) by that  year's\r\n\nend.\r\n\n     Finally, the tax court readily could have found that the\r\n\nbare  allegation of  insolvency made  in Drexel's  1992 civil\r\n\ncomplaint lacked sufficient indicia of reliability to warrant\r\n\nadmission  of  the complaint  under  Fed.  R. Evid.  803(24).\r\n\nUnder  the circumstances,  the tax  court did  not abuse  its\r\n\ndiscretion in declining to admit the complaint for its truth.\r\n\nWe reject  the Barretts' suggestion--made for  the first time\r\n\nin their reply brief--that the tax court did not finally rule\r\n\non this issue.\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                         \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n",

Commissioner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583400\"><a href=\"/opinion/583400/gerald-leuhsler-beverly-leuhsler-v-commissioner-of-internal-revenue/\"><span class=\"volume\">963</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">907</span></a></span>, 910 (6th Cir.1992) (observing that a tax court's findings on negligence issues are reviewed for clear error).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Barretts contested the deficiency determination for 1990 on the ground that they are entitled to a bad debt deduction for that year.  See I.R.C. &#167; 166.  To succeed on this contention, they were required to prove that the Note became totally worthless in 1990.  Treas.  Reg. &#167; 1.166-5(a)(2);  Buchanan v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"720581\"><a href=\"/opinion/720581/mary-a-buchanan-and-gordon-buchanan-jr-v-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></a></span>, 198-99 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">363</span></span> (1996).  The Barretts failed to meet this burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Drexel's filing for bankruptcy in 1990 is not enough, by itself, to establish that the Note became worthless that year.  See Cox v. Commissioner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"7892\"><a href=\"/opinion/7892/cox-v-cir/\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></a></span>, 131 (5th Cir.1995).  Rather, the question whether any of Drexel's assets would be available to pay the Note depends upon the value of Drexel's assets, the amount and validity of senior claims, and the cost of the bankruptcy administration.  See Dallmeyer v. Commissioner, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">T.C.</span> <span class=\"page\">1282</span></span>, 1293 (1950).  We think the tax court could properly find that the Barretts failed to show these latter factors and that the record indicates these factors could not be determined with any degree of certainty in 1990.  In short, the Barretts failed to meet their burden of showing that the facts and circumstances known at the end of 1990 made it reasonable to abandon hope that they would recover something on their Note.  See Estate of Mann v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"433554\"><a href=\"/opinion/433554/estate-of-guy-l-mann-deceased-suzanne-mann-duval-administratrix-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">731</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span>, 278 (5th Cir.1984) (\"If and when [a debt] becomes wholly worthless must be determined from the facts and circumstances known or which reasonably could have been known at the end of the year of asserted worthlessness.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial testimony of Andrew Rothenberg cited by the Barretts does not alter our conclusion.  It is plain that Rothenberg was addressing the prospects of recovery on the Note in 1992, when the plan of reorganization was proposed.  By then, the largest claims against the Drexel estate had been settled.  The participants in the bankruptcy proceeding presumably had a much clearer picture of the assets available, the claims that would be allowed, and the amount and ranking of claims.  Rothenberg does not address the prospects of recovery in 1990 based on facts and circumstances known (or reasonably knowable) by that year's end.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the tax court readily could have found that the bare allegation of insolvency made in Drexel's 1992 civil complaint lacked sufficient indicia of reliability to warrant admission of the complaint under Fed.R.Evid. 803(24).  Under the circumstances, the tax court did not abuse its discretion in declining to admit the complaint for its truth.  We reject the Barretts' suggestion--made for the first time in their reply brief--that the tax court did not finally rule on this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We note, in particular, that the Barretts have never adequately explained why they did not have (and keep) records of the amount they paid for the stock.  Based on such records, the Barretts could easily have supplied their tax preparer with the correct basis of the stock</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
