After careful review of the parties' briefs\r                           \r\n\nand the record, we find  no reason to reverse the   mandatory\r\n\nminimum  sentence  imposed by  the  district  court under  21\r\n\nU.S.C.   841(b)(1)(B).\r\n\n     The district court found that defendant was not entitled\r\n\nto relief from the mandatory minimum sentence because  he had\r\n\nnot truthfully provided all the information he had concerning\r\n\nthe offense.   See   18 U.S.C.    3553(f); U.S.S.G.    5C1.2.\r                              \r\n\nThat determination is supported by the applicable law and the\r\n\ninformation presented at the sentencing hearing.  \r\n\n     For example, the  co-defendant's recorded  conversations\r\n\ndepicted  defendant as the supplier of the cocaine.  Based on\r\n\nthis and other evidence, the court permissibly could conclude\r\n\nthat defendant's role extended beyond  that of a mere courier\r\n\nand that defendant's proffer,  claiming that his knowledge of\r\n\nand role  in the offense was  limited to that of  a mule, was\r\n\nnot truthful.  \"Where  there is more than one  plausible view\r\n\nof the  circumstances, the  sentencing  court's choice  among\r\n\nsupportable  alternatives  cannot   be  clearly   erroneous.\"\r\n\nUnited States v.

See U.S.S.G.\r                                                                \r\n\n   5G1.1(c)(2) (\"sentence may be imposed  at any point within\r\n\nthe applicable guideline range, provided that the sentence is\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nnot less that  the statutorily  required minimum  sentence\");\r\n\nUnited States  v.
