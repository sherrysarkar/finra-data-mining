Thomas       Dowd,     a       prolific       pro   se\n\nlitigant, appeals from separate district court judgments\n\ndismissing a trio of actions he brought under 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1983.    These are only the latest in a series of state and\n\nfederal court cases filed by Dowd involving one or both of\n\ntwo related events: his 1997 eviction from a residence in\n\nDedham, Massachusetts, and his ensuing inability (because he\n\nis no longer a town resident) to vote in Dedham elections.\n\nWe summarily affirm in each instance, deeming it sufficient\n\nto note that each of the three complaints is devoid of\n\nmerit.\n\n            In     No.    01-1828,       Dowd     alleges             that    some    17\n\ndefendants       conspired       to    seize    the    Dedham              property   in\n\nviolation of the Fourth Amendment.                 The property transfer,\n\nhowever,    occurred       in    accordance       with       a     summary-process\n\naction   in      state    court       whose    legality          is    not     here   in\n\nquestion.        Whether the no-trespassing notice was posted\n\nprematurely       or     otherwise      improperly           was       a     matter   of\n\nMassachusetts law that should have been (and undoubtedly\n\nwas) pursued in state court.                  The Fourth Amendment is not\n\nthereby implicated.\n\n                                        -2-\n\f            In Nos. 01-1171 & 01-2157, Dowd charges the Dedham\n\nBoard of Registrars with depriving him of the right to vote\n\nin recent elections, in violation of the Due Process Clause.\n\nWe need not decide whether the first of these cases was\n\nsubject    to    dismissal        for   untimely       service    of    process,\n\ninasmuch    as   both      plainly      fail     on    the   merits.      It   is\n\nundisputed that Dowd is now living in a residence outside of\n\nDedham.    His two key assertions--that he intended to stay in\n\nthe   Dedham     house      and    that    he    was     wrongfully      evicted\n\ntherefrom--fail to establish that his domicile remained in\n\nDedham, at least with the legality of the eviction having\n\nnow been confirmed.               See, e.g., Mass. G.L. c. 51, § 1\n\n(stating that only city or town \"resident\" may have name\n\n\"entered    on       the   list    of   voters\");        Dane    v.    Board   of\n\nRegistrars of Voters of Concord, 374 Mass. 152, 161-63\n\n(1978) (equating \"residency\" with \"domicile\" in this context\n\nand defining latter term).                Nor did Dowd's deposit of an\n\nescrow ballot in a 2000 election, pursuant to Mass. G.L. c.\n\n51, § 59A, establish any right to vote thereafter; the very\n\npurpose of that procedure is to obviate the need for such a\n\ndetermination where possible.              In any event, these again are\n\nquestions       of     state      law     that        neither    implicate      a\n\nconstitutional right nor otherwise warrant federal court\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fintervention.
