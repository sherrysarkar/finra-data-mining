Ronald R. Lagueux, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                 Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n           Boudin and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n Ronald L'Heureux on brief pro se.\r\n Jeffrey B. Pine, Attorney General and Elisabeth A. Wallace,\r\nSpecial Assistant Attorney General, on Motion to Dismiss Appeal or\r\nto Summarily Affirm the Judgment Below and Memorandum in Support,\r\nfor appellees.\r\n\nOctober 13, 1998\r\n\n        Per Curiam.  Upon careful consideration of\r\nplaintiff's brief and defendants' motion to dismiss this\r\nappeal, and de novo review of the record, we conclude that the\r\ndistrict court did not err in granting summary judgment for\r\ndefendants and in refusing to exercise pendent jurisdiction. \r\nWe reach this conclusion for the following reasons:\r\n          1.   As to the first amendment claims, even to the\r\nextent that plaintiff may have had some constitutional right to\r\nact as a jailhouse lawyer for other inmates, any such right was\r\nnot unfettered:  \"plaintiff in this case is a prisoner and\r\nunlike an ordinary citizen, his associational rights may be\r\npermissibly restricted by prison authorities because of the\r\ninstitutional need to maintain order.\"  Rizzo v. Dawson, 778\r\nF.2d 527, 531-32 (9th Cir. 1985).  Such restriction is \"valid\r\nif it is reasonably related to legitimate penological\r\ninterests.\"  Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89-90 (1987). \r\nHere, defendants presented sufficient justification for the\r\nsubject restrictions, the substance of which plaintiff failed\r\nto refute as required under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).  Thus, as\r\nfar as the record shows, the regulations violated by plaintiff\r\nand the resulting disciplinary actions did not unreasonably\r\nimpinge on his first amendment rights.  Accordingly, summary\r\njudgment for defendants on the first amendment claims was\r\nwarranted.  \r\n          2.   As to plaintiff's due process claims, the\r\ndisciplinary  segregatio  imposed was not such an atypical, \r\n                            -2-\r\nsignificant deprivation as would create a liberty interest\r\nsubject to constitutional due process protection.  See Sandinv. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 485-86 (1995).  Further, plaintiff's\r\nclaims regarding loss of good time credits were not cognizable\r\nin this  1983 action.  See Edwards v. Balisok, 117 S.Ct. 1584,\r\n1588-89 (1997).  Because, under Sandin and Balisok, neither of\r\nplaintiff's disciplinary proceedings raised due process claims\r\ncognizable in this federal action, there was no call to\r\nconsider plaintiff's additional arguments that the proceedings\r\nviolated various consent decrees and other state laws and\r\nregulations.  Accordingly, summary judgment for defendants on\r\nthe due process claims was appropriate, and the district court\r\nproperly declined to exercise jurisdiction over plaintiff's\r\nstate law claims. \r\n          3.   Defendants' conduct in disciplining plaintiff,\r\neven if not unconstitutional, still might have been actionable\r\nif it was done in retaliation for plaintiff's exercise of\r\nconstitutionally protected rights.  See Ferranti v. Moran, 618\r\nF.2d 888 892 n.4 (1st Cir. 1980).  To succeed on such a\r\nretaliation claim, plaintiff must prove that the action would\r\nnot have been taken \"but for\" the alleged improper reason. \r\nMcDonald v. Hall, 610 F.2d 16, 18 (1st Cir. 1979).  Conclusory\r\nallegations are not sufficient.  See Leonardo v. Moran, 611\r\nF.2d 397, 398 (1st Cir. 1979).  Here, plaintiff's allegations\r\nof a retaliatory conspiracy remained vague and conclusory, and\r\nthose allegations did not establish a \"but for\" connection\r\nbetween the disciplinary proceedings and the alleged\r\nretaliatory motive.  Therefore, on the record here, summary\r\njudgment for defendants on the retaliation claims also was\r\nproper.  See McDonald, 610 F.2d at 18-19.\r\n          4.   Further, we agree with the district court that\r\nall defendants were entitled to qualified immunity as to the\r\ndamage claims.  And we note that the state Department of\r\nCorrections was not a party to the district court action or to\r\nthis appeal, so that plaintiff's claims for injunctive relief\r\nagainst the state DOC have no merit whatsoever.\r\n          5.   To the extent that the additional arguments and\r\nclaims raised in plaintiff's brief are cognizable at all in\r\nthis appeal, they are meritless.\r\n          Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r\n",
