(\"NFL Properties\")  (collectively \"Defendants\"),\r\n\non  Grubb's claims  of copyright  infringement under 17  U.S.C.  \r\n\n501.  We affirm the decision of the district court.\r\n\n                          I.  BACKGROUND\r                                    I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          Resolving reasonable inferences in  favor of Grubb, the\r\n\nnonmovant, the summary judgment materials show the following.\r\n\n          The Patriots, a professional football team and a member\r\n\nof  the  National Football  League,  informed  NFL Properties  on\r\n\nJanuary 17, 1993, that  they were considering  a logo change  for\r\n\nthe upcoming season.  NFL Properties, among  other tasks, manages\r\n\ndesign  and publishing  production assignments  for the  National\r\n\nFootball League.  At a meeting between Patriots officials and NFL\r\n\nProperties  representatives  on January  27,  1993,  the Patriots\r\n\nasked that the design of the  new logo be created within the next\r\n\nfew weeks.\r\n\n          Accordingly,    NFL   Properties    contacted   several\r\n\nindependent design  firms.  On  January 27, 1993,  Bradley Jansen\r\n\n(\"Jansen\")  of NFL  Properties  approached  Evenson Design  Group\r\n\n(\"Evenson\") about the project, and Evenson agreed  to begin work.\r\n\nVia  overnight   courier,  Jansen  sent  to   Evenson  a  package\r\n\ncontaining,  among other  things,  a purchase  order and  designs\r\n\nsimilar  to the one that the Patriots had considered and rejected\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nin 1979 (\"the 1979 proposed Patriots logo\").  Jansen continued to\r\n\nbe in contact with, and meet with, Patriots employees thereafter.\r\n\n          The package was received  on January 28, 1993.   In his\r\n\ndeposition, Ken Loh  (\"Loh\"), an Evenson employee, stated that he\r\n\nbegan sketching the design that the Patriots  eventually chose to\r\n\nreplace their old logo (\"the Patriots' new logo\").   With the aid\r\n\nof his timesheets,  which were  generated by  a computer  program\r\n\nthat both Plaintiff  and Defendants have stipulated could  not be\r\n\nbackdated,  Loh indicated  that  he had  virtually completed  the\r\n\nPatriots'  new  logo  by February  4,  1993.    Referring to  his\r\n\ntimesheets, Loh stated  that as  of that  date he  began work  on\r\n\ncreating  other  logos  and  revising  the  logo  he had  already\r\n\ncreated, which he identified as the Patriots new logo.\r\n\n          On February 12, 1993, Evenson sent Loh's  design to NFL\r\n\nProperties.    Representatives of  NFL  Properties  met with  the\r\n\nPatriots  on February  18, 1993.   The  Patriots were  shown many\r\n\nproposed  logos, including  Loh's.   The Patriots  selected Loh's\r\n\ndesign as their new logo on March 5, 1993.\r\n\n          Meanwhile, on  February 9, 1993,  having heard  through\r\n\nthe  news media that the  Patriots planned to  change their logo,\r\n\nGrubb submitted an unsolicited proposed design (\"Grubb's design\")\r\n\nto the  Patriots' office  in Foxborough,  Massachusetts.  In  his\r\n\ndeposition, Grubb stated that he was told by a Patriots' employee\r\n\nthat  the   Patriots  would  contact  him   later  regarding  his\r\n\nsubmission.  Grubb holds  a Certificate of Copyright Registration\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nfor his  design, which the United States  Copyright Office issued\r\n\nto him effective February 1, 1994.\r\n\n          The Patriots' new logo  and Grubb's design contain some\r\n\nof the same elements,  including a man's face in  profile, stars,\r\n\nand  stripes.1  The  district court  granted summary  judgment to\r\n\nDefendants.   The district court  concluded that Grubb  failed to\r\n\nshow that Loh had access to Grubb's work, relying in  part on the\r\n\nfact that the Patriots established and followed a policy that was\r\n\ndesigned  to  prevent designers  -- such  as  Loh --  from seeing\r\n\noutside submissions.  Additionally, the district court found that\r\n\nLoh  composed the  Patriots'  new logo  independently of  Grubb's\r\n\ndesign.   In the instant  appeal, Grubb  challenges the  district\r\n\ncourt's grant of  summary judgment to Defendants.  In particular,\r\n\nGrubb  argues that  his  Supplemental Affidavit,  in which  Grubb\r\n\ncompares  Loh's work  and his  own, asserts  facts that  create a\r\n\ndirect conflict with Loh's testimony, on which the district court\r\n\nrelied.   In the  Supplemental Affidavit, Grubb  states that \"the\r\n\nrelative  proportions of  the  elements of  the  two designs  are\r\n\nsubstantially identical  and the  curve of  the base  line .  . .\r\n\nappears to be a precise match,\" and that Loh's work was \"probably\r\n\n. . .  traced from some other drawing.\"   According to Grubb, the\r\n\ndistrict court  erred in  crediting Loh's  testimony in light  of\r\n\nGrubb's Supplemental Affidavit.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  See appendices following this opinion.\r                \r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n                     II.  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r                               II.  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\n          Summary  judgment is  appropriate when  \"the pleadings,\r\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and  admissions on file,\r\n\ntogether with the affidavits . . . show that there  is no genuine\r\n\nissue  as to  any  material fact  and that  the  moving party  is\r\n\nentitled to  a judgment  as a  matter of law.\"   Kelly  v. United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates, 924 F.2d 355, 357 (1st Cir. 1991); see also  Fed. R.

Under  Rule 56(c),  the opponent  of the  motion must\r\n\nproduce  evidence on which a reasonable finder of fact, under the\r\n\nappropriate proof burden, could base a verdict for the  opponent;\r\n\nif  the opponent cannot produce such evidence, the motion must be\r\n\ngranted.

DISCUSSION\r\n\n          To  prevail on  a  claim of  copyright infringement,  a\r\n\nplaintiff  must  show two  elements:   (1)  ownership of  a valid\r\n\ncopyright  and (2) copying of  the protected work  by the alleged\r\n\ninfringer.   See Concrete  Mach. Co.  v. Classic  Lawn Ornaments,\r                                                                           \r\n\nInc., 843 F.2d 600, 605 (1st Cir. 1988); 3 Melvin  B.

Defendants do  not\r                           \r\n\ncontest Plaintiff's ownership of a valid copyright on his design.\r\n\nTherefore, we turn to  the issue of whether summary  judgment was\r\n\nproper with respect to the alleged copying.\r\n\n          \"Proof by  direct evidence of copying  is generally not\r\n\npossible since the actual  act of copying is rarely  witnessed or\r\n\nrecorded.\"    Concrete Mach.,  843 F.2d  at  606.

MCA, Inc., 812 F.2d 421,\r                                                            \r\n\n423  (9th Cir. 1987), and  that there is \"substantial similarity\"\r\n\nbetween the works, Walker v. Time  Life Films, Inc., 784 F.2d 44,\r                                                             \r\n\n48 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1159 (1986); see Sid &amp; Marty\r                                                                           \r\n\nKrofft  Television Prods.,  Inc.  v.

Even if both  showings are made,\r\n\nhowever, the trier of fact may nonetheless find no copying if the\r\n\ndefendant shows  independent creation.  Concrete  Mach., 843 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\nat  606 n.6; Eden  Toys, Inc. v.

Viewing the summary judgment record  in\r\n\nthe  best light for Plaintiff, we conclude  that he has failed to\r\n\nraise  a  genuine  issue  of   material  fact  with  respect   to\r\n\nDefendants' \"access\";  this deficiency alone suffices  to justify\r\n\nsummary judgment.\r\n\n          To satisfy its burden  of showing access, the plaintiff\r\n\nmust  produce evidence  from which  a reasonable  finder of  fact\r\n\ncould infer that  the defendant had  a reasonable opportunity  to\r\n\ncopy his or her work.  See Selle v. Gibb, 741  F.2d 896, 901 (7th\r                                                  \r\n\nCir. 1984).  Evidence that only creates a \"bare possibility\" that\r\n\nthe  defendant had access is  not sufficient to  create a factual\r\n\nissue as to copying.  Jason v. Fonda, 526 F. Supp. 774, 777 (C.D.\r                                              \r\n\nCal. 1981) (concluding  that the  fact that between  200 and  700\r\n\ncopies of plaintiff's book  were available in Southern California\r\n\nbookstores  was  insufficient  to  infer  that  defendant   movie\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nproducers had a  reasonable opportunity to  copy it), aff'd,  698\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.2d  966 (9th Cir. 1982).  \"[T]he  jury cannot draw an inference\r\n\nof  access based upon speculation and  conjecture alone.\"  Selle,\r                                                                          \r\n\n741 F.2d at 901.\r\n\n          On  the  summary  judgment  materials  before  it,  the\r\n\ndistrict   court  concluded  that,  even  drawing  all  favorable\r\n\ninferences for Grubb, the  evidence did not demonstrate  that Loh\r\n\nhad  access  to  Grubb's design;  in  fact,  it  showed that  Loh\r\n\ncomposed his design  independently of and prior  to Grubb's work.\r\n\nWith respect to  Loh's access, Grubb  contends that the  district\r\n\ncourt  erred, since an alleged  copier's access may  be proven by\r\n\nshowing that  an intermediary with  whom the copier  was involved\r\n\nhad  access to the copyrighted  work under circumstances in which\r\n\nthe  copier also may  have been given an  opportunity to view the\r\n\ncopyrighted  work.    Grubb  also argues  that  his  Supplemental\r\n\nAffidavit  is  evidence that  Loh had  access to  Grubb's design.\r\n\nWith respect to the district court's finding of independent prior\r\n\ncreation,  Grubb argues  that Loh's  testimony suggests  that Loh\r\n\ntraced  the Patriots' New Logo  from another design.   Grubb also\r\n\nquestions   Loh's   credibility,   and   submits   that   Grubb's\r\n\nSupplemental Affidavit is evidence that Loh did not independently\r\n\ncreate the Patriots' new logo prior to Grubb's design.\r\n\n          Turning first  to Loh's  access, it is  undisputed that\r\n\nthe  Patriots received  Grubb's sketch  on February 9,  1993, via\r\n\nGrubb's unsolicited  submission.  Grubb points  to several pieces\r\n\nof   evidence  that  he  believes  shows  Loh  had  a  reasonable\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nopportunity to copy Grubb's design.  First, according to  Grubb's\r\n\ndeposition, the individual Patriots' employee to whom he gave the\r\n\ndesign told him that the  Patriots would get in contact with  him\r\n\nin  the  future.   Additionally, Grubb  points  to the  fact that\r\n\nJansen,  as an  employee of  NFL Properties,  admits that  he had\r\n\ncontact with representatives of the Patriots beginning on January\r\n\n27,  1993, and  that Jansen had  also hired the  design firm that\r\n\nemployed Loh.   Grubb  claims that  Jansen is  a point  of access\r\n\nbetween Loh's firm and the Patriots, from which a finder  of fact\r\n\ncould  permissibly  infer  a  reasonable   opportunity  to  copy.\r\n\nFinally, Grubb claims that his Supplemental Affidavit is evidence\r\n\nthat Loh had access to Grubb's design.\r\n\n          We  need  not  resolve  Grubb's  contention  that  this\r\n\nevidence  entitles him to  a finding of  access, however, because\r\n\neven assuming,  arguendo, that it did, the undisputed evidence is\r                                  \r\n\nthat  Loh created  the Patriots'  New Logo  prior to  February 9,\r\n\n1993.2   As noted, supra, Grubb  does not just have  to show that\r                                  \r\n\nLoh had  access to Grubb's work;  Grubb has to show  that Loh had\r\n\naccess to Grubb's work before Loh created the Patriots' New Logo.\r\n\nSee Concrete Mach., 843 F.2d at 605 n.6; Baxter, 812 F.2d at 423.\r                                                         \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2   The  district  court described  this  as  \"independent  prior\r\ncreation,\"  an  independent  showing  that rebuts  a  finding  of\r\naccess.

With  the aid\r\n\nof his  timesheets, he was able in his deposition to pinpoint the\r\n\nday  he created  these  works  as January  28,  1993.   What  Loh\r\n\nidentified  as  having  been  created during  this  period  bears\r\n\nunmistakable resemblance to the Patriots' New Logo, save for  the\r\n\ncolor of the  star3 in  the hat and  a few  shadings on the  face\r\n\ndepicted.   This  testimony  demonstrates that  Loh did  not have\r\n\naccess  to Grubb's  design prior  to creating  the  Patriots' new\r\n\nlogo, see Baxter, 812  F.2d at 423, since Grubb's  evidence shows\r                          \r\n\nthat Loh could not  have viewed Grubb's design prior  to February\r\n\n9, 1993.\r\n\n          To be sure, Grubb  argues that he does in  fact dispute\r\n\nLoh's testimony, and therefore, there  remains a genuine issue of\r\n\nmaterial fact as to the issue  of Loh's prior creation.  However,\r\n\non summary judgment, absent specific facts discrediting testimony\r\n\nfrom  a witness associated with  the movant, and  absent a direct\r\n\nconflict  in the  testimony, the  opponent (although  entitled to\r\n\nhave his or her evidence  taken as true) is not entitled  to have\r\n\nthe  defendant's  evidence positively  disbelieved.

Grubb first questions the credibility  of\r\n\nLoh's testimony, and second argues that Loh's testimony conflicts\r\n\nwith Grubb's  Supplemental Affidavit, since Grubb  therein opines\r\n\nthat  his and  Loh's designs are  so similar  that Loh  must have\r\n\ncopied Grubb's work.\r\n\n          Grubb attempts to call into question Loh's testimony by\r\n\narguing that Loh's computer software timesheets do not  show what\r\n\nLoh had  drawn on  any particular  date, and  that Loh could  not\r\n\nidentify individual sketches he created during the design process\r\n\nby specific date.   Grubb  also points to  Loh's admission  that,\r\n\nwithout his timesheets, he could not remember on what date he did\r\n\nwhat.   Furthermore, Grubb  argues that Loh  was still  sketching\r\n\npossible logos  on or after  February 9, 1993.   All of  this is,\r\n\nhowever, irrelevant.  The  parties stipulated that the timesheet-\r\n\ngenerating software  program could  not be  backdated.   With his\r\n\ntimesheets and the summaries therein of how he used his time, Loh\r\n\ntestified  in his deposition that  he began sketching the designs\r\n\nfor the Patriots'  New Logo on January 28,  1993, and by February\r\n\n4, 1993, he  had essentially  finished designing it.   While  Loh\r\n\ntestified  that  he  was  still  working  on  the  project  after\r\n\nFebruary 9,  he also  testified  that this  work involved  simple\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nrefinements, such as changing  the color of  the star.  The  fact\r\n\nthat Loh needed  his timesheets  to recollect dates,  or that  he\r\n\ncontinued  to work on the Patriots project after February 9, does\r\n\nnot discredit his testimony,  particularly where it is undisputed\r\n\nthat the timesheets could not have been backdated.\r\n\n          Besides challenging the credibility of Loh's testimony,\r\n\nGrubb  also  argues  that his  Supplemental  Affidavit represents\r\n\nfacts  in   direct  conflict  with  Loh's   testimony.    Grubb's\r\n\nSupplemental Affidavit expresses his opinion of the Patriots' new\r\n\nlogo's similarity  to Grubb's work.  Grubb  supplies reasoning --\r\n\npointing to the relative  proportions of the elements of  the two\r\n\ndesigns and the curve of the base line -- for why he believes the\r\n\ndesigns are similar.  Grubb also concludes that Loh's design must\r\n\nhave been traced from another design.\r\n\n          Grubb's argument seems to be that 1) Loh traced, and 2)\r\n\nLoh's work resembles Grubb's work, therefore Loh's testimony that\r\n\nhe did not copy Grubb's work, and in fact,  created the Patriots'\r\n\nnew  logo before Grubb submitted  his own design,  is in dispute.\r\n\nHowever, similarity alone  cannot lead to  a finding of  copying,\r\n\nwithout  evidence  of access  prior  to  the allegedly  offending\r\n\nwork's creation.   As a result, we  must look to  whether Grubb's\r\n\naffidavit actually creates a direct conflict with Loh's testimony\r\n\n--   since  the  latter   rebutted  any  finding   of  access  by\r\n\ndemonstrating prior  creation.   We conclude that,  even assuming\r\n\nthat Grubb's Supplemental Affidavit is properly considered expert\r\n\ntestimony, it  is  simply  not  in  direct  conflict  with  Loh's\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\ntestimony.  Similarity cannot substitute for access, and the fact\r\n\nthat Loh admitted  to having  done \"tracings\" in  the process  of\r\n\nproducing his work does not conflict with Loh's statement that he\r\n\nhad virtually  completed the  Patriots' New  Logo by February  4,\r\n\n1993,  since Loh admitted  that Evenson  had various  pictures of\r\n\ncolonial  soldiers  that  he   used,  and  the  Summary  Judgment\r\n\nmaterials indicated that Loh was sent designs similar to the 1979\r\n\nproposed Patriots' logo, which  also depicted a colonial soldier.\r\n\nThe fact  that Loh did tracings is  simply not in direct conflict\r\n\nwith Loh's testimony that  he had created the Patriots'  new logo\r\n\nby February 4, 1993.  \r\n\n          As  a result,  like  the district  court before  us, we\r\n\nconclude  that Loh  composed his  design prior  to  Grubb's work.\r\n\nSuch prior creation renders any conclusion of access or inference\r\n\nof  copying illogical.  See  Concrete Mach., 843  F.2d at 606 n.6\r                                                     \r\n\n(stating that  \"[a]lthough access plus substantial  similarity is\r\n\nrequired  to show copying, the trier of fact may nonetheless find\r\n\nno copying if the defendant shows independent creation\").\r\n\n          Because both access and substantial similarity need  be\r\n\nshown, see  Concrete Mach. Co., 843 F.2d  at 606; O'Neill v.

NFL Properties, among other tasks, manages design and publishing production assignments for the National Football League.   At a meeting between Patriots officials and NFL Properties representatives on January 27, 1993, the Patriots asked that the design of the new logo be created within the next few weeks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, NFL Properties contacted several independent design firms.   On January 27, 1993, Bradley Jansen (\"Jansen\") of NFL Properties approached Evenson Design Group (\"Evenson\") about the project, and Evenson agreed to begin work.   Via overnight courier, Jansen sent to Evenson a package containing, among other things, a purchase order and designs similar to the one that the Patriots had considered and rejected in 1979 (\"the 1979 proposed Patriots logo\").   Jansen continued to be in contact with, and meet with, Patriots employees thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The package was received on January 28, 1993.   In his deposition, Ken Loh (\"Loh\"), an Evenson employee, stated that he began sketching the design that the Patriots eventually chose to replace their old logo (\"the Patriots' new logo\").   With the aid of his timesheets, which were generated by a computer program that both Plaintiff and Defendants have stipulated could not be backdated, Loh indicated that he had virtually completed the Patriots' new logo by February 4, 1993.   Referring to his timesheets, Loh stated that as of that date he began work on creating other logos and revising the logo he had already created, which he identified as the Patriots new logo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 12, 1993, Evenson sent Loh's design to NFL Properties.   Representatives of NFL Properties met with the Patriots on February 18, 1993.   The Patriots were shown many proposed logos, including Loh's.   The Patriots selected Loh's design as their new logo on March 5, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, on February 9, 1993, having heard through the news media that the Patriots planned to change their logo, Grubb submitted an unsolicited proposed design (\"Grubb's design\") to the Patriots' office in Foxborough, Massachusetts.   In his deposition, Grubb stated that he was told by a Patriots' employee that the Patriots would contact him later regarding his submission.   Grubb holds a Certificate of Copyright Registration for his design, which the United States Copyright Office issued to him effective February 1, 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Patriots' new logo and Grubb's design contain some of the same elements, including a man's face in profile, stars, and stripes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The district court granted summary judgment to Defendants.   The district court concluded that Grubb failed to show that Loh had access to Grubb's work, relying in part on the fact that the Patriots established and followed a policy that was designed to prevent designers--such as Loh--from seeing outside submissions.   Additionally, the district court found that Loh composed the Patriots' new logo independently of Grubb's design.   In the instant appeal, Grubb challenges the district court's grant of summary judgment to Defendants.   In particular, Grubb argues that his Supplemental Affidavit, in which Grubb compares Loh's work and his own, asserts facts that create a direct conflict with Loh's testimony, on which the district court relied.   In the Supplemental Affidavit, Grubb states that \"the relative proportions of the elements of the two designs are substantially identical and the curve of the base line ... appears to be a precise match,\" and that Loh's work was \"probably ... traced from some other drawing.\"   According to Grubb, the district court erred in crediting Loh's testimony in light of Grubb's Supplemental Affidavit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits ... show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"  Kelly v.

Under Rule 56(c), the opponent of the motion must produce evidence on which a reasonable finder of fact, under the appropriate proof burden, could base a verdict for the opponent;  if the opponent cannot produce such evidence, the motion must be granted.

Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510-11, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prevail on a claim of copyright infringement, a plaintiff must show two elements:  (1) ownership of a valid copyright and (2) copying of the protected work by the alleged infringer.   See Concrete Mach. Co. v. Classic Lawn Ornaments, Inc., 843 F.2d 600, 605 (1st Cir.1988);  3 Melvin B. Nimmer, The Law of Copyright &#167; 13.01 at 13-3 (1987).   Defendants do not contest Plaintiff's ownership of a valid copyright on his design.   Therefore, we turn to the issue of whether summary judgment was proper with respect to the alleged copying.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Proof by direct evidence of copying is generally not possible since the actual act of copying is rarely witnessed or recorded.\"  Concrete Mach., 843 F.2d at 606.   Absent direct evidence, copying may be inferred from a showing that the defendant had \"access\" to the plaintiff's work prior to the creation of defendant's work, Baxter v. MCA, Inc., 812 F.2d 421, 423 (9th Cir.1987), and that there is \"substantial similarity\" between the works, Walker v. Time Life Films, Inc., 784 F.2d 44, 48 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1159, 106 S.Ct. 2278, 90 L.Ed.2d 721 (1986);  see Sid &amp; Marty Krofft Television Prods., Inc. v. McDonald's Corp., 562 F.2d 1157, 1162-63 (9th Cir.1977).   Even if both showings are made, however, the trier of fact may nonetheless find no copying if the defendant shows independent creation.  Concrete Mach., 843 F.2d at 606 n. 6;  Eden Toys, Inc. v. Marshall Field &amp; Co., 675 F.2d 498, 501 (2d Cir.1982).   Viewing the summary judgment record in the best light for Plaintiff, we conclude that he has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact with respect to Defendants' \"access\";  this deficiency alone suffices to justify summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To satisfy its burden of showing access, the plaintiff must produce evidence from which a reasonable finder of fact could infer that the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to copy his or her work.   See Selle v. Gibb, 741 F.2d 896, 901 (7th Cir.1984).   Evidence that only creates a \"bare possibility\" that the defendant had access is not sufficient to create a factual issue as to copying.  Jason v. Fonda, 526 F.Supp. 774, 777 (C.D.Cal.1981) (concluding that the fact that between 200 and 700 copies of plaintiff's book were available in Southern California bookstores was insufficient to infer that defendant movie producers had a reasonable opportunity to copy it), aff'd, 698 F.2d 966 (9th Cir.1982).  \"[T]he jury cannot draw an inference of access based upon speculation and conjecture alone.\"  Selle, 741 F.2d at 901.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the summary judgment materials before it, the district court concluded that, even drawing all favorable inferences for Grubb, the evidence did not demonstrate that Loh had access to Grubb's design;  in fact, it showed that Loh composed his design independently of and prior to Grubb's work.   With respect to Loh's access, Grubb contends that the district court erred, since an alleged copier's access may be proven by showing that an intermediary with whom the copier was involved had access to the copyrighted work under circumstances in which the copier also may have been given an opportunity to view the copyrighted work.   Grubb also argues that his Supplemental Affidavit is evidence that Loh had access to Grubb's design.   With respect to the district court's finding of independent prior creation, Grubb argues that Loh's testimony suggests that Loh traced the Patriots' New Logo from another design.   Grubb also questions Loh's credibility, and submits that Grubb's Supplemental Affidavit is evidence that Loh did not independently create the Patriots' new logo prior to Grubb's design.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning first to Loh's access, it is undisputed that the Patriots received Grubb's sketch on February 9, 1993, via Grubb's unsolicited submission.   Grubb points to several pieces of evidence that he believes shows Loh had a reasonable opportunity to copy Grubb's design.   First, according to Grubb's deposition, the individual Patriots' employee to whom he gave the design told him that the Patriots would get in contact with him in the future.   Additionally, Grubb points to the fact that Jansen, as an employee of NFL Properties, admits that he had contact with representatives of the Patriots beginning on January 27, 1993, and that Jansen had also hired the design firm that employed Loh.   Grubb claims that Jansen is a point of access between Loh's firm and the Patriots, from which a finder of fact could permissibly infer a reasonable opportunity to copy.   Finally, Grubb claims that his Supplemental Affidavit is evidence that Loh had access to Grubb's design.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not resolve Grubb's contention that this evidence entitles him to a finding of access, however, because even assuming, arguendo, that it did, the undisputed evidence is that Loh created the Patriots' New Logo prior to February 9, 1993.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  As noted, supra, Grubb does not just have to show that Loh had access to Grubb's work;  Grubb has to show that Loh had access to Grubb's work before Loh created the Patriots' New Logo.   See Concrete Mach., 843 F.2d at 605 n. 6;  Baxter, 812 F.2d at 423.   In his deposition, Loh stated that he began working on the Patriots' New Logo on January 28, 1993, and by February 4, 1993, had finished, save for later refinements, the Patriots' New Logo.   Additionally, in his affidavit, Loh further testified that, in late January of 1993, he created a pencil sketch of the Patriots' New Logo, to which he added color later that day.   With the aid of his timesheets, he was able in his deposition to pinpoint the day he created these works as January 28, 1993.   What Loh identified as having been created during this period bears unmistakable resemblance to the Patriots' New Logo, save for the color of the star<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> in the hat and a few shadings on the face depicted.   This testimony demonstrates that Loh did not have access to Grubb's design prior to creating the Patriots' new logo, see Baxter, 812 F.2d at 423, since Grubb's evidence shows that Loh could not have viewed Grubb's design prior to February 9, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, Grubb argues that he does in fact dispute Loh's testimony, and therefore, there remains a genuine issue of material fact as to the issue of Loh's prior creation.   However, on summary judgment, absent specific facts discrediting testimony from a witness associated with the movant, and absent a direct conflict in the testimony, the opponent (although entitled to have his or her evidence taken as true) is not entitled to have the defendant's evidence positively disbelieved.  Takeall v. Pepsico, Inc., 809 F.Supp. 19, 23 (D.Md.1992), aff'd, 14 F.3d 596 (4th Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 2742, 129 L.Ed.2d 861 (1994);  see also Moreau v. Local 247, Int'l Bhd. of Firemen, 851 F.2d 516, 519 (1st Cir.1988);  10A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller and Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure:  Civil 2d &#167; 2726 at 119, nn. 11-12 (1983).   Grubb first questions the credibility of Loh's testimony, and second argues that Loh's testimony conflicts with Grubb's Supplemental Affidavit, since Grubb therein opines that his and Loh's designs are so similar that Loh must have copied Grubb's work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grubb attempts to call into question Loh's testimony by arguing that Loh's computer software timesheets do not show what Loh had drawn on any particular date, and that Loh could not identify individual sketches he created during the design process by specific date.   Grubb also points to Loh's admission that, without his timesheets, he could not remember on what date he did what.   Furthermore, Grubb argues that Loh was still sketching possible logos on or after February 9, 1993.   All of this is, however, irrelevant.   The parties stipulated that the timesheet-generating software program could not be backdated.   With his timesheets and the summaries therein of how he used his time, Loh testified in his deposition that he began sketching the designs for the Patriots' New Logo on January 28, 1993, and by February 4, 1993, he had essentially finished designing it.   While Loh testified that he was still working on the project after February 9, he also testified that this work involved simple refinements, such as changing the color of the star.   The fact that Loh needed his timesheets to recollect dates, or that he continued to work on the Patriots project after February 9, does not discredit his testimony, particularly where it is undisputed that the timesheets could not have been backdated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Besides challenging the credibility of Loh's testimony, Grubb also argues that his Supplemental Affidavit represents facts in direct conflict with Loh's testimony.   Grubb's Supplemental Affidavit expresses his opinion of the Patriots' new logo's similarity to Grubb's work.   Grubb supplies reasoning--pointing to the relative proportions of the elements of the two designs and the curve of the base line--for why he believes the designs are similar.   Grubb also concludes that Loh's design must have been traced from another design.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grubb's argument seems to be that 1) Loh traced, and 2) Loh's work resembles Grubb's work, therefore Loh's testimony that he did not copy Grubb's work, and in fact, created the Patriots' new logo before Grubb submitted his own design, is in dispute.   However, similarity alone cannot lead to a finding of copying, without evidence of access prior to the allegedly offending work's creation.   As a result, we must look to whether Grubb's affidavit actually creates a direct conflict with Loh's testimony--since the latter rebutted any finding of access by demonstrating prior creation.   We conclude that, even assuming that Grubb's Supplemental Affidavit is properly considered expert testimony, it is simply not in direct conflict with Loh's testimony.   Similarity cannot substitute for access, and the fact that Loh admitted to having done \"tracings\" in the process of producing his work does not conflict with Loh's statement that he had virtually completed the Patriots' New Logo by February 4, 1993, since Loh admitted that Evenson had various pictures of colonial soldiers that he used, and the Summary Judgment materials indicated that Loh was sent designs similar to the 1979 proposed Patriots' logo, which also depicted a colonial soldier.   The fact that Loh did tracings is simply not in direct conflict with Loh's testimony that he had created the Patriots' new logo by February 4, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result, like the district court before us, we conclude that Loh composed his design prior to Grubb's work.   Such prior creation renders any conclusion of access or inference of copying illogical.   See Concrete Mach., 843 F.2d at 606 n. 6 (stating that \"[a]lthough access plus substantial similarity is required to show copying, the trier of fact may nonetheless find no copying if the defendant shows independent creation\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because both access and substantial similarity need be shown, see Concrete Mach. Co., 843 F.2d at 606;  O'Neill v. Dell Publishing Co., 630 F.2d 685, 686 (1st Cir.1980), and Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact regarding access, we need go no further.   While Plaintiff argues that \"[w]here two designs are so similar that one must have been copied from the other, proof of access may not be required, because no explanation other than copying is reasonably possible,\" Brief for the Plaintiff-Appellant at 13, the lone case that Plaintiff cites for this proposition, Flag Fables, Inc. v. Jean Ann's Country Flags and Crafts, Inc., 730 F.Supp. 1165 (D.Mass.1989), in fact states that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>this Court's view of the present dispute [is that] given the indisputable access and substantial similarity between the two parties' banners, the evidence of independent creation advanced at the hearing by defendants was simply not persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 1181 (emphasis added).   Thus, Plaintiff misstates the law by failing to recognize that he bears the burden of showing both reasonable access and substantial similarity.  Concrete Mach., 843 F.2d at 606;  Walker, 784 F.2d at 48;  Sid &amp; Marty Krofft Television, 562 F.2d at 1162-63.   The reason for both requirements is simple:  copyright protection precludes only copying;  if two people arrive at the same result independently, copyright law will not protect the first.   See Selle, 741 F.2d at 896 (7th Cir.1984) (stating that \"two works may be identical in every detail, but, if the alleged infringer created the accused work independently or both works were copied from a common source in the public domain, then there is no infringement\");  3 Nimmer &#167; 13.02;  see also Arthur v. American Broadcasting Cos., 633 F.Supp. 146, 148 n. 3, 149 (S.D.N.Y.1985) (concluding no infringement even where expressions are extremely similar, if \"nearly all the similarity can be attributed to the fact that both [works] are artist's renderings of the same unprotectible idea\";  ideas cannot be protected under copyright law, 17 U.S.C. &#167; 102(b)).   Thus, like the district court before us, we need not address the issue of substantial similarity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of the foregoing, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.APPENDICES</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>NOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLE</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>proposed 1979 Patriots' logo</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>[Appendix at A0092]NOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLE</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">sketch identified by Loh as created on January 28, 1993</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>[Appendix at A0124]NOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLE</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">sketch described by Loh as created on January 28, 1993, by adding color to pencil sketch</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>[Appendix at A0307]NOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLE</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>[Appendix at A0136]</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A0136</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grubb's designNOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLE</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the Patriots' New Logo</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>[Appendix at A0144]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> See appendices following this opinion</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The district court described this as \"independent prior creation,\" an independent showing that rebuts a finding of access.

We affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Resolving reasonable inferences in favor of Grubb, the nonmovant, the summary judgment materials show the following.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Patriots, a professional football team and a member of the National Football League, informed NFL Properties on January 17, 1993, that they were considering a logo change for the upcoming season.   NFL Properties, among other tasks, manages design and publishing production assignments for the National Football League.   At a meeting between Patriots officials and NFL Properties representatives on January 27, 1993, the Patriots asked that the design of the new logo be created within the next few weeks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, NFL Properties contacted several independent design firms.   On January 27, 1993, Bradley Jansen (\"Jansen\") of NFL Properties approached Evenson Design Group (\"Evenson\") about the project, and Evenson agreed to begin work.   Via overnight courier, Jansen sent to Evenson a package containing, among other things, a purchase order and designs similar to the one that the Patriots had considered and rejected in 1979 (\"the 1979 proposed Patriots logo\").   Jansen continued to be in contact with, and meet with, Patriots employees thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The package was received on January 28, 1993.   In his deposition, Ken Loh (\"Loh\"), an Evenson employee, stated that he began sketching the design that the Patriots eventually chose to replace their old logo (\"the Patriots' new logo\").   With the aid of his timesheets, which were generated by a computer program that both Plaintiff and Defendants have stipulated could not be backdated, Loh indicated that he had virtually completed the Patriots' new logo by February 4, 1993.   Referring to his timesheets, Loh stated that as of that date he began work on creating other logos and revising the logo he had already created, which he identified as the Patriots new logo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 12, 1993, Evenson sent Loh's design to NFL Properties.   Representatives of NFL Properties met with the Patriots on February 18, 1993.   The Patriots were shown many proposed logos, including Loh's.   The Patriots selected Loh's design as their new logo on March 5, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, on February 9, 1993, having heard through the news media that the Patriots planned to change their logo, Grubb submitted an unsolicited proposed design (\"Grubb's design\") to the Patriots' office in Foxborough, Massachusetts.   In his deposition, Grubb stated that he was told by a Patriots' employee that the Patriots would contact him later regarding his submission.   Grubb holds a Certificate of Copyright Registration for his design, which the United States Copyright Office issued to him effective February 1, 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Patriots' new logo and Grubb's design contain some of the same elements, including a man's face in profile, stars, and stripes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The district court granted summary judgment to Defendants.   The district court concluded that Grubb failed to show that Loh had access to Grubb's work, relying in part on the fact that the Patriots established and followed a policy that was designed to prevent designers--such as Loh--from seeing outside submissions.   Additionally, the district court found that Loh composed the Patriots' new logo independently of Grubb's design.   In the instant appeal, Grubb challenges the district court's grant of summary judgment to Defendants.   In particular, Grubb argues that his Supplemental Affidavit, in which Grubb compares Loh's work and his own, asserts facts that create a direct conflict with Loh's testimony, on which the district court relied.   In the Supplemental Affidavit, Grubb states that \"the relative proportions of the elements of the two designs are substantially identical and the curve of the base line ... appears to be a precise match,\" and that Loh's work was \"probably ... traced from some other drawing.\"   According to Grubb, the district court erred in crediting Loh's testimony in light of Grubb's Supplemental Affidavit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prevail on a claim of copyright infringement, a plaintiff must show two elements:  (1) ownership of a valid copyright and (2) copying of the protected work by the alleged infringer.   See Concrete Mach. Co. v. Classic Lawn Ornaments, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"503998\"><a href=\"/opinion/503998/concrete-machinery-company-inc-v-classic-lawn-ornaments-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">843</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">600</span></a></span>, 605 (1st Cir.1988);  3 Melvin B. Nimmer, The Law of Copyright &#167; 13.01 at 13-3 (1987).   Defendants do not contest Plaintiff's ownership of a valid copyright on his design.   Therefore, we turn to the issue of whether summary judgment was proper with respect to the alleged copying.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Proof by direct evidence of copying is generally not possible since the actual act of copying is rarely witnessed or recorded.\"  Concrete Mach., 843 F.2d at 606.   Absent direct evidence, copying may be inferred from a showing that the defendant had \"access\" to the plaintiff's work prior to the creation of defendant's work, Baxter v. MCA, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"483610\"><a href=\"/opinion/483610/leslie-t-baxter-v-mca-inc-a-delaware-corporation-universal-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">812</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">421</span></a></span>, 423 (9th Cir.1987), and that there is \"substantial similarity\" between the works, Walker v.

Even if both showings are made, however, the trier of fact may nonetheless find no copying if the defendant shows independent creation.  Concrete Mach., 843 F.2d at 606 n. 6;  Eden Toys, Inc. v. Marshall Field &amp; Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"402339\"><a href=\"/opinion/402339/eden-toys-inc-v-marshall-field-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">675</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">498</span></a></span>, 501 (2d Cir.1982).   Viewing the summary judgment record in the best light for Plaintiff, we conclude that he has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact with respect to Defendants' \"access\";  this deficiency alone suffices to justify summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To satisfy its burden of showing access, the plaintiff must produce evidence from which a reasonable finder of fact could infer that the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to copy his or her work.   See Selle v. Gibb, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"440147\"><a href=\"/opinion/440147/ronald-h-selle-v-barry-gibb-and-ronald-h-selle-v-barry-gibb/\"><span class=\"volume\">741</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">896</span></a></span>, 901 (7th Cir.1984).   Evidence that only creates a \"bare possibility\" that the defendant had access is not sufficient to create a factual issue as to copying.  Jason v. Fonda, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1375510\"><a href=\"/opinion/1375510/jason-v-fonda/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">774</span></a></span>, 777 (C.D.Cal.1981) (concluding that the fact that between 200 and 700 copies of plaintiff's book were available in Southern California bookstores was insufficient to infer that defendant movie producers had a reasonable opportunity to copy it), aff'd, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"413457\"><a href=\"/opinion/413457/sonya-jason-v-jane-fonda/\"><span class=\"volume\">698</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">966</span></a></span> (9th Cir.1982).  \"[T]he jury cannot draw an inference of access based upon speculation and conjecture alone.\"  Selle, 741 F.2d at 901.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the summary judgment materials before it, the district court concluded that, even drawing all favorable inferences for Grubb, the evidence did not demonstrate that Loh had access to Grubb's design;  in fact, it showed that Loh composed his design independently of and prior to Grubb's work.   With respect to Loh's access, Grubb contends that the district court erred, since an alleged copier's access may be proven by showing that an intermediary with whom the copier was involved had access to the copyrighted work under circumstances in which the copier also may have been given an opportunity to view the copyrighted work.   Grubb also argues that his Supplemental Affidavit is evidence that Loh had access to Grubb's design.   With respect to the district court's finding of independent prior creation, Grubb argues that Loh's testimony suggests that Loh traced the Patriots' New Logo from another design.   Grubb also questions Loh's credibility, and submits that Grubb's Supplemental Affidavit is evidence that Loh did not independently create the Patriots' new logo prior to Grubb's design.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning first to Loh's access, it is undisputed that the Patriots received Grubb's sketch on February 9, 1993, via Grubb's unsolicited submission.   Grubb points to several pieces of evidence that he believes shows Loh had a reasonable opportunity to copy Grubb's design.   First, according to Grubb's deposition, the individual Patriots' employee to whom he gave the design told him that the Patriots would get in contact with him in the future.   Additionally, Grubb points to the fact that Jansen, as an employee of NFL Properties, admits that he had contact with representatives of the Patriots beginning on January 27, 1993, and that Jansen had also hired the design firm that employed Loh.   Grubb claims that Jansen is a point of access between Loh's firm and the Patriots, from which a finder of fact could permissibly infer a reasonable opportunity to copy.   Finally, Grubb claims that his Supplemental Affidavit is evidence that Loh had access to Grubb's design.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not resolve Grubb's contention that this evidence entitles him to a finding of access, however, because even assuming, arguendo, that it did, the undisputed evidence is that Loh created the Patriots' New Logo prior to February 9, 1993.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  As noted, supra, Grubb does not just have to show that Loh had access to Grubb's work;  Grubb has to show that Loh had access to Grubb's work before Loh created the Patriots' New Logo.   See Concrete Mach., 843 F.2d at 605 n. 6;  Baxter, 812 F.2d at 423.   In his deposition, Loh stated that he began working on the Patriots' New Logo on January 28, 1993, and by February 4, 1993, had finished, save for later refinements, the Patriots' New Logo.   Additionally, in his affidavit, Loh further testified that, in late January of 1993, he created a pencil sketch of the Patriots' New Logo, to which he added color later that day.   With the aid of his timesheets, he was able in his deposition to pinpoint the day he created these works as January 28, 1993.   What Loh identified as having been created during this period bears unmistakable resemblance to the Patriots' New Logo, save for the color of the star<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> in the hat and a few shadings on the face depicted.   This testimony demonstrates that Loh did not have access to Grubb's design prior to creating the Patriots' new logo, see Baxter, 812 F.2d at 423, since Grubb's evidence shows that Loh could not have viewed Grubb's design prior to February 9, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, Grubb argues that he does in fact dispute Loh's testimony, and therefore, there remains a genuine issue of material fact as to the issue of Loh's prior creation.   However, on summary judgment, absent specific facts discrediting testimony from a witness associated with the movant, and absent a direct conflict in the testimony, the opponent (although entitled to have his or her evidence taken as true) is not entitled to have the defendant's evidence positively disbelieved.

Miller and Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure:  Civil 2d &#167; 2726 at 119, nn. 11-12 (1983).   Grubb first questions the credibility of Loh's testimony, and second argues that Loh's testimony conflicts with Grubb's Supplemental Affidavit, since Grubb therein opines that his and Loh's designs are so similar that Loh must have copied Grubb's work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grubb attempts to call into question Loh's testimony by arguing that Loh's computer software timesheets do not show what Loh had drawn on any particular date, and that Loh could not identify individual sketches he created during the design process by specific date.   Grubb also points to Loh's admission that, without his timesheets, he could not remember on what date he did what.   Furthermore, Grubb argues that Loh was still sketching possible logos on or after February 9, 1993.   All of this is, however, irrelevant.   The parties stipulated that the timesheet-generating software program could not be backdated.   With his timesheets and the summaries therein of how he used his time, Loh testified in his deposition that he began sketching the designs for the Patriots' New Logo on January 28, 1993, and by February 4, 1993, he had essentially finished designing it.   While Loh testified that he was still working on the project after February 9, he also testified that this work involved simple refinements, such as changing the color of the star.   The fact that Loh needed his timesheets to recollect dates, or that he continued to work on the Patriots project after February 9, does not discredit his testimony, particularly where it is undisputed that the timesheets could not have been backdated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Besides challenging the credibility of Loh's testimony, Grubb also argues that his Supplemental Affidavit represents facts in direct conflict with Loh's testimony.   Grubb's Supplemental Affidavit expresses his opinion of the Patriots' new logo's similarity to Grubb's work.   Grubb supplies reasoning--pointing to the relative proportions of the elements of the two designs and the curve of the base line--for why he believes the designs are similar.   Grubb also concludes that Loh's design must have been traced from another design.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grubb's argument seems to be that 1) Loh traced, and 2) Loh's work resembles Grubb's work, therefore Loh's testimony that he did not copy Grubb's work, and in fact, created the Patriots' new logo before Grubb submitted his own design, is in dispute.   However, similarity alone cannot lead to a finding of copying, without evidence of access prior to the allegedly offending work's creation.   As a result, we must look to whether Grubb's affidavit actually creates a direct conflict with Loh's testimony--since the latter rebutted any finding of access by demonstrating prior creation.   We conclude that, even assuming that Grubb's Supplemental Affidavit is properly considered expert testimony, it is simply not in direct conflict with Loh's testimony.   Similarity cannot substitute for access, and the fact that Loh admitted to having done \"tracings\" in the process of producing his work does not conflict with Loh's statement that he had virtually completed the Patriots' New Logo by February 4, 1993, since Loh admitted that Evenson had various pictures of colonial soldiers that he used, and the Summary Judgment materials indicated that Loh was sent designs similar to the 1979 proposed Patriots' logo, which also depicted a colonial soldier.   The fact that Loh did tracings is simply not in direct conflict with Loh's testimony that he had created the Patriots' new logo by February 4, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result, like the district court before us, we conclude that Loh composed his design prior to Grubb's work.   Such prior creation renders any conclusion of access or inference of copying illogical.   See Concrete Mach., 843 F.2d at 606 n. 6 (stating that \"[a]lthough access plus substantial similarity is required to show copying, the trier of fact may nonetheless find no copying if the defendant shows independent creation\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because both access and substantial similarity need be shown, see Concrete Mach. Co., 843 F.2d at 606;  O'Neill v. Dell Publishing Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"382169\"><a href=\"/opinion/382169/daniel-j-oneill-v-dell-publishing-co-inc-neal-r-burger-and-george/\"><span class=\"volume\">630</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">685</span></a></span>, 686 (1st Cir.1980), and Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact regarding access, we need go no further.   While Plaintiff argues that \"[w]here two designs are so similar that one must have been copied from the other, proof of access may not be required, because no explanation other than copying is reasonably possible,\" Brief for the Plaintiff-Appellant at 13, the lone case that Plaintiff cites for this proposition, Flag Fables, Inc. v. Jean Ann's Country Flags and Crafts, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">730</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1165</span></span> (D.Mass.1989), in fact states that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>this Court's view of the present dispute [is that] given the indisputable access and substantial similarity between the two parties' banners, the evidence of independent creation advanced at the hearing by defendants was simply not persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 1181 (emphasis added).   Thus, Plaintiff misstates the law by failing to recognize that he bears the burden of showing both reasonable access and substantial similarity.  Concrete Mach., 843 F.2d at 606;  Walker, 784 F.2d at 48;  Sid &amp; Marty Krofft Television, 562 F.2d at 1162-63.   The reason for both requirements is simple:  copyright protection precludes only copying;  if two people arrive at the same result independently, copyright law will not protect the first.   See Selle, 741 F.2d at 896 (7th Cir.1984) (stating that \"two works may be identical in every detail, but, if the alleged infringer created the accused work independently or both works were copied from a common source in the public domain, then there is no infringement\");  3 Nimmer &#167; 13.02;  see also Arthur v. American Broadcasting Cos., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1678449\"><a href=\"/opinion/1678449/arthur-v-american-broadcasting-companies-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">633</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></a></span>, 148 n. 3, 149 (S.D.N.Y.1985) (concluding no infringement even where expressions are extremely similar, if \"nearly all the similarity can be attributed to the fact that both [works] are artist's renderings of the same unprotectible idea\";  ideas cannot be protected under copyright law, 17 U.S.C. &#167; 102(b)).   Thus, like the district court before us, we need not address the issue of substantial similarity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of the foregoing, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.APPENDICES</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>NOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLE</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>proposed 1979 Patriots' logo</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>[Appendix at A0092]NOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLE</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">sketch identified by Loh as created on January 28, 1993</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>[Appendix at A0124]NOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLE</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">sketch described by Loh as created on January 28, 1993, by adding color to pencil sketch</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>[Appendix at A0307]NOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLE</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>[Appendix at A0136]</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A0136</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grubb's designNOTE: OPINION CONTAINS TABLE OR OTHER DATA THAT IS NOT VIEWABLE</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the Patriots' New Logo</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>[Appendix at A0144]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> See appendices following this opinion</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The district court described this as \"independent prior creation,\" an independent showing that rebuts a finding of access.
