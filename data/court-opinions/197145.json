See International Ass'n  of\r                                                                           \r\n\nMachinists  v. Winship Green Nursing Ctr., 914 F.

BACKGROUND\r\n\n          We present the basic facts in the light most flattering\r\n\nto  the party vanquished by  summary judgment.   All the relevant\r\n\nevents occurred in 1994, and all dates refer to that year.\r\n\n                                A\r                                          A\r\n\n          In May  the Union  mounted a  campaign to organize  the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1An IAM  official, Dale Hartford,  is also a  plaintiff, and\r\ntwo affiliates  of Winship (Hillhaven Corp.  and First Healthcare\r\nCorp.) are codefendants.  Since the  presence of these additional\r\nparties  does not  affect  the issues  on  appeal, we  treat  the\r\nlitigation  as  if it  involved  only  the  Union (as  plaintiff-\r\nappellant) and Winship (as defendant-appellee).\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nnonprofessional employees  at Winship's facility in  Bath, Maine.\r\n\nNot   surprisingly,  management  resisted   this  initiative  and\r\n\nexhorted the affected employees to vote against IAM's election as\r\n\na collective bargaining  representative.  As  part of its  retort\r\n\nWinship  hand-delivered  two  pieces  of  campaign  literature to\r\n\nemployees in the putative  bargaining unit.  These handouts  form\r\n\nthe basis for IAM's lawsuit.\r\n\n          1.  The  First Flier.   In July  Winship distributed  a\r                    1.  The  First Flier.\r                                        \r\n\nthree-page flier, the first page of which asks rhetorically:\r\n\n          WHAT  WOULD YOU  DO IF  YOU GOT  THE ATTACHED\r\n          LETTERS?\r\n          WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO FIND ANOTHER JOB?\r\n          HOW WOULD YOU PAY YOUR BILLS?\r\n          WOULD YOU WISH THAT THE MACHINISTS UNION  HAD\r\n          NEVER GOTTEN IN AT WINSHIP GREEN?\r\n\nThe  flier then advises recipients  that \"IT'S NOT  TOO LATE\" and\r\n\nimplores them  to \"GIVE  [certain  named managers]  A CHANCE\"  by\r\n\n\"VOT[ING] NO ON  AUGUST 4.\"  The  letters, addressed individually\r\n\nto particular  employees and dated  one year after  the scheduled\r                                                            \r\n\nelection, comprise the second and third pages of the flier.   One\r\n\nletter purports to be written on the Union's letterhead, complete\r\n\nwith a reproduction of the IAM service mark  (consisting of a set\r\n\nof  machinist's tools surrounded by a gear and the IAM name)2 and\r\n\nthe facsimile signature of an IAM plenipotentiary, Dale Hartford.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2Service marks  and  trademarks  function  to  identify  the\r\nsource  of  services and  goods,  respectively.   The  difference\r\nbetween the  two types of marks is not relevant here, and thus we\r\nwill apply case law involving either form.  See Star Fin. Servs.,\r                                                                           \r\nInc. v. AASTAR Mortgage Corp., 89  F.3d 5, 8 n.1 (1st Cir. 1996);\r                                       \r\nVolkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft  v. Wheeler, 814  F.2d 812, 815\r                                                       \r\nn.1 (1st Cir. 1987).\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nThis  missive suggests that the Union had notified Winship of its\r\n\nobligation,   pursuant  to  an   invented  collective  bargaining\r\n\nagreement, to terminate the recipient's employment because of her\r\n\nfailure  to  pay certain  assessments  (e.g., union  dues  and an\r\n\ninitiation fee).  The other epistle, signed by Winship's director\r\n\nof  operations, is  also  postdated.   It acknowledges  Winship's\r\n\nreceipt  of the notice and professes to inform the addressee that\r\n\nthe company must honor the Union's request.\r\n\n          2.   The Second Flier.  The remaining piece of campaign\r                    2.   The Second Flier.\r                                         \r\n\nliterature,  disseminated  by  Winship  a  few  days  before  the\r\n\nelection, urges the reader to vote against unionization and warns\r\n\nthat union  membership will bring  significant financial burdens.\r\n\nThis  flier  contains  a  simulated  invoice  inscribed  on  what\r\n\npurports  to be IAM's letterhead (and which bears the IAM service\r\n\nmark).  Under  a heading  that reads \"PAYABLE  TO THE  MACHINISTS\r\n\nUNION BY [employee's name]\", the invoice lists amounts designated\r\n\nas  union  dues, an  initiation  fee,  and  fines.3   Commentary,\r\n\nundiluted by subtlety, accompanies this listing:  \"NO MATTER WHAT\r\n\nTHE  UNION HAS  TOLD  YOU    JUST ASK  THE  EMPLOYEES AT  LOURDES\r\n\nHOSPITAL\" AND \"JUST ASK  THE 13 EMPLOYEES AT GENERAL  ELECTRIC IN\r\n\nSOUTH PORTLAND  WHO  WERE  FINED  FOR CROSSING  THE  PICKET  LINE\r\n\nTHERE.\"    Large,  bold letters  at  the  bottom  of the  invoice\r\n\nproclaim:  \"WITHOUT THE MACHINISTS UNION, DO NOT PAY THIS BILL.\"\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3The  stated  amounts  are  not  only  apocryphal  but  also\r\nextravagant.    During  the   organizing  drive,  IAM  repeatedly\r\ndeclared  that there  would  be no  initiation  fee and  that  no\r\nworker's monthly dues would exceed $20.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\n          Notwithstanding Winship's tactics   or, perhaps, due to\r\n\nthem    the employees  chose IAM  as their  collective bargaining\r\n\nrepresentative in the August 4 election.\r\n\n                                B\r                                          B\r\n\n          The Union  proved to be a  sore winner.  It  soon filed\r\n\nsuit against Winship  alleging inter alia  trademark infringement\r                                                   \r\n\nand unfair competition under the Lanham Act.4  The Union premised\r\n\nits  federal claims on the theory that Winship's unauthorized use\r\n\nof the registered service mark occurred \"in connection with . . .\r\n\nservices,\" namely, IAM's  representational services, and  thereby\r\n\ntransgressed sections 32(1) and 43(a) of the  Lanham Act.  See 15\r                                                                        \r\n\nU.S.C.     1114(1)(a)  &amp;  1125(a) (quoted  infra  note 5).    The\r                                                          \r\n\ndistrict court  rejected this  theory for the  reasons previously\r\n\nmentioned.   See  IAM, 914  F.  Supp.  at 655-56.    This  appeal\r                               \r\n\nfollowed.\r\n\nII.  THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\r          II.  THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\r\n\n          Though the case  is unconventional,  the generic  legal\r\n\nstandard  that we  must apply  is prosaic.   Summary  judgment is\r\n\nappropriate in  trademark infringement cases,  as elsewhere,  \"if\r\n\nthe  pleadings,  depositions,  answers  to  interrogatories,  and\r\n\nadmissions on  file, together with  the affidavits, if  any, show\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4IAM's  complaint  also  embodied a  salmagundi  of  pendent\r\nstate-law  claims.   The  district court  dismissed these  claims\r\nwithout prejudice  coincident with the entry  of summary judgment\r\non  the federal  claims.   See  IAM,  914 F.  Supp. at  656.   We\r                                             \r\nunderstand  that the Union is pursuing these claims in a separate\r\nstate  court action.   Finally,  the complaint  sought injunctive\r\nrelief  under  the Norris-LaGuardia  Act,  29  U.S.C.     101-115\r\n(1994), but the Union now concedes the infirmity of this request.\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nthat  there is no genuine issue as  to any material fact and that\r\n\nthe moving party is entitled  to a judgment as a matter  of law.\"\r\n\nBoston  Athletic Ass'n  v. Sullivan,  867 F.2d  22, 24  (1st Cir.\r                                             \r\n\n1989) (quoting Fed.  R. Civ.  P. 56(c)).   Generally speaking,  a\r\n\nfact is \"material\" if  it potentially affects the outcome  of the\r\n\nsuit, see Garside  v. Osco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d  46, 48 (1st Cir.\r                                               \r\n\n1990),  and  a  dispute over  it  is  \"genuine\"  if the  parties'\r\n\npositions on the issue are supported by conflicting evidence, see\r                                                                           \r\n\nAnderson v.

This is\r\n\nespecially  true  in respect  to claims  or  issues on  which the\r\n\nnonmovant  bears the burden  of proof; in  such circumstances she\r\n\n\"must reliably  demonstrate  that specific  facts  sufficient  to\r\n\ncreate an authentic dispute exist.\"  Garside, 895 F.2d at 48; see\r                                                                           \r\n\nalso Anderson, 477 U.S. at 256.\r                       \r\n\n          We review de novo the district court's grant of summary\r\n\njudgment.  See Mack  v. Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea  Co., 871 F.2d 179,\r                                                            \r\n\n181  (1st Cir.  1989).

First, because\r\n\nthe listed factors  must be evaluated in  context, any meaningful\r\n\ninquiry  into   the  likelihood  of  confusion  necessarily  must\r\n\nreplicate  the  circumstances  in  which  the  ordinary  consumer\r\n\nactually confronts  (or probably  will confront)  the conflicting\r\n\nmark.   See, e.g.,  Libman Co.  v. Vining  Indus., Inc., 69  F.3d\r                                                                 \r\n\n1360, 1362 (7th Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 116 S.

On summary  judgment the reviewing court must\r\n\ndecide  whether the evidence as a whole, taken most hospitably to\r\n\nthe markholder,  generates a  triable issue  as to likelihood  of\r\n\nconfusion.   See Sullivan,  867 F.2d  at 29;  Astra, 718  F.2d at\r                                                             \r\n\n1205;  see also 3 McCarthy, supra,   23.11 (observing that, while\r                                           \r\n\nlegal  precedent governs the analysis, the result of each case is\r\n\ncontrolled by the totality of its facts).\r\n\n          Applying these  principles, we conclude that  the Union\r\n\nbears  the  burden  here  of adducing  \"significantly  probative\"\r\n\nevidence,  Anderson,  477  U.S.  at  249-50  (citation  omitted),\r                             \r\n\ntending to show that an appreciable number of  prospective voters\r\n\n(i.e., employees within the defined bargaining unit) were in fact\r\n\nlikely  to be confused or misled into believing that the service-\r\n\nmarked campaign  literature was produced, sent,  or authorized by\r\n\nIAM.  The Union has not reached this plateau.\r\n\n                                C\r                                          C\r\n\n          As  we set  the  scene  for  the  main  thrust  of  our\r\n\nanalysis,  we acknowledge that the campaign stump is an odd stage\r\n\nfor playing out  a Lanham Act  drama.  In the  typical commercial\r\n\nsetting, confusion as to  the source of goods or  services occurs\r\n\nwhen there is an unacceptably high risk that a buyer may purchase\r\n\none product or service in the mistaken belief that she is  buying\r\n\na different product  or service.  See, e.g., Star,  89 F.3d at 9.\r                                                           \r\n\nBut the instant case is well off  the beaten track.  It does  not\r\n\ninvolve  two entrepreneurs  vying to  sell competing  products or\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\nservices  in the traditional sense.   Rather, IAM  was angling to\r\n\nrepresent the workers and,  although Winship opposed that effort,\r\n\nit was neither offering nor seeking to provide a similar service.\r\n\nIn  the  vernacular of  the  marketplace, IAM  was  \"selling\" its\r\n\nservices to prospective union members and Winship was \"selling\" a\r\n\nnegative   the  lack of a need for any  such services or service-\r\n\nprovider.\r\n\n          This twist  has significant implications for  a court's\r\n\nassessment  of  the  likelihood  of confusion.    If  we  assume,\r\n\nfavorably to the  Union, that confusion as  to the source  of the\r\n\ndocuments bearing  the IAM service  mark may at  least indirectly\r\n\ndeter prospective purchasers (voters within the bargaining  unit)\r\n\nfrom acquiring (voting for) IAM's representational services, that\r\n\ndeterrent will exist only  if, and to the extent  that, confusion\r\n\ncauses  purchasers to be misinformed about the nature or value of\r\n\nthe  services.   We  think it  follows  inexorably that,  if  the\r\n\nelectorate  can readily  identify Winship  as  the source  of the\r\n\npromotional  materials,  the  deterrent  vanishes.    See,  e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nMcIntyre v. Ohio  Elections Comm'n,  115 S. Ct.  1511, 1519  n.11\r                                            \r\n\n(1995) (suggesting that once people know the source of a writing,\r\n\nthey can  evaluate its  message, and, at  that point, \"it  is for\r\n\nthem to decide what is responsible, what is valuable, and what is\r\n\ntruth\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  In that\r\n\nevent,  there is no misleading as to  the genesis of the letters,\r\n\nand the  voters can assess whether  the Winship-authored handouts\r\n\naccurately describe the Union's services, or, instead, are merely\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\na   manifestation  of  Winship's  no-holds-barred  commitment  to\r\n\ndissuade  the  voters  from  \"purchasing\" those  services.    Put\r\n\nanother  way, knowledge as to the source of the materials dispels\r\n\nincipient confusion.\r\n\n          The Union attempts to confess  and avoid.  It  contends\r\n\nthat  the recipients'  ability  to ascertain  the  source of  the\r\n\ndocuments does not necessarily negate confusion.  This contention\r\n\nhinges on the  theory that  employees may have  thought that  the\r\n\nletters,  even  if delivered  by  the  company, were  actual  IAM\r\n\ndocuments which  Winship procured  and then draped  in anti-union\r\n\ninvective.  But  that theory does not  fit the facts:   patently,\r\n\nthis  is neither  an  instance in  which an  employer distributes\r\n\ncopies  of a  notice  previously sent  by  a union  to  employees\r\n\nelsewhere  and adds anti-union  commentary, nor  one in  which an\r\n\nemployer makes minor emendations  to an authentic union document.\r\n\nThe  letters  and  the  invoice  are composed  around  names  and\r\n\ncircumstances  indigenous  to   this  particular   organizational\r\n\neffort.   Among other things, the letters bear a date significant\r\n\nin its  relation to  the  scheduled election;  they address  each\r\n\nWinship employee by name and home address; and they identify this\r\n\nemployer.   Source-identifiers specific  to the Winship  election\r\n\nare even more pervasive in the fictitious invoice.\r\n\n          The Union's fallback position seems to be that, even if\r\n\nit is nose-on-the-face plain that the letters and the invoice are\r\n\nnot  replicas of  genuine IAM  materials, the  affected employees\r\n\nstill may have believed  that they somehow were based  on genuine\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\nmaterials.  We think  this construct is both legally  unsound and\r\n\nfactually unsupported.  In the first place, a recipient's ability\r\n\nto  recognize that the alleged infringer, at a minimum, must have\r\n\nsubstantially  added  to or  altered  a  document alleviates  any\r\n\nconfusion as to its immediate source.   Cf. Warner Bros., Inc. v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nAmerican Broadcasting  Cos., 720  F.2d 231,  246  (2d Cir.  1983)\r                                     \r\n\n(suggesting that  lack of  substantial similarity leaves  \"little\r\n\nbasis\"  for asserting  likelihood of  confusion  in a  Lanham Act\r\n\nclaim).    In  the  second place,  even  indulging  the  arguendo\r\n\nassumption that  the contrived  documents  were based  on a  real\r\n\nscenario, the  alterations  are sufficiently  extensive  that  an\r\n\nordinary recipient,  possessing a modicum  of intelligence, could\r\n\nnot help but recognize that Winship had tampered so substantially\r\n\nwith  the documents  that they  could no  longer be  perceived as\r\n\nemanating  from  the  Union.6   In  other  words,  the documents'\r\n\ncredibility  would depend  on the  voters' assessment  of whether\r\n\nWinship was  telling the truth.

What is  more,  we have\r\n\nrecognized that in certain  circumstances otherwise similar marks\r\n\nare  not likely to  be confused if  they are  used in conjunction\r\n\nwith  clearly displayed names,  logos or other source-identifying\r\n\ndesignations of the manufacturer.  See Aktiebolaget Electrolux v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nArmatron Int'l, Inc., 999 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1993); Pignons, 657\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d  at  487.

Furthermore,\r\n\neven  if the documents  are evaluated in the  abstract, we do not\r\n\nthink that  any reasonable person, viewing them in their entirety\r\n\nand in  conjunction with  the accompanying materials,  would find\r\n\nthem similar to IAM's authentic campaign literature.\r\n\n          On the one hand, any similarity to actual IAM materials\r\n\nis limited to the vitriolic tone, the presence of the IAM service\r\n\nmark, and the facsimile signature.  On the other hand, unlike any\r\n\ngenuine IAM  communication, the letters  are postdated by  a full\r\n\nyear and address  the employees as if  they already had opted  in\r\n\nfavor of union representation.  The next piece of propaganda (the\r\n\ninvoice) contains  anti-union messages  that are longer  and much\r\n\nmore  prominent than  any other  text.   And, moreover,  in stark\r\n\ncontrast to  handbills distributed by IAM  which invariably urged\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\nemployees to vote \"yes\" (i.e., for a union), the letters at issue\r\n\nwere attached to rabidly anti-union fliers exhorting employees to\r\n\nvote \"no\" (i.e., against a union).  In  short, the bogus letters,\r\n\nwhen compared to  the real McCoy,  are distinctive in  appearance\r\n\nand antithetical  in content.  Given  such gross dissimilarities,\r\n\nit cannot reasonably be  inferred that ordinarily prudent workers\r\n\nwould be likely to confuse the source of the letters.

The parties'  channels of trade  are widely disparate\r\n\n(reduced to  bare  essence, IAM  sells representational  services\r\n\nwhereas  Winship  sells  nursing  home  beds),  and  there  is no\r\n\nevidence   that  the  channels  advertising  those  services  are\r\n\nsimilar.\r\n\n          To  be sure, as the  election campaign picked up steam,\r\n\nboth  parties  propagandized  (and, in  that  sense,  advertised)\r\n\nthrough  the  same  medium (print),  and  both  of  them targeted\r\n\nexactly  the same  narrowly-defined  cadre of  individuals.   The\r\n\nclass  of prospective  purchasers  is necessarily  restricted  to\r\n\n                                18\r\r\n\nthose  individuals and  is,  therefore, identical.   Still,  that\r\n\nidenticality does  not advance the  Union's cause in  the special\r\n\ncircumstances of this case.\r\n\n          On  this point,  the requisite  inquiry is  not limited\r\n\nmerely to determining whether the class of prospective purchasers\r\n\nis the same or different.   Instead, a court called upon to assay\r\n\nlikelihood  of confusion  must ponder  the sophistication  of the\r\n\nclass, thereby taking account of the context in which the alleged\r\n\ninfringer uses the mark.  See, e.g., Astra, 718 F.2d  at 1206-07;\r                                                    \r\n\nHQ  Network Sys.  v. Executive Headquarters,  755 F.

Hartford\r\n\nopines  that \"these figures  seem to have  had to have  come from\r\n\n[the apocryphal union invoice].\"   This evidence, standing alone,\r\n\nis insufficient to prove actual confusion.\r\n\n          The fundamental problem with  the Hartford affidavit is\r\n\nthat, even taking  its contents  as literally true,  it does  not\r\n\nundermine what is perfectly obvious from a reading of the record:\r\n\nno person of ordinary prudence  and normal intelligence, aware of\r\n\nwhat was happening around her, would have been confused as to the\r\n\nsource  or  sponsorship  of the  letters.    For  one thing,  the\r\n\ninquiries to which Hartford alludes reveal at most that employees\r\n\ndoubted whether he would have written a letter unfavorable to the\r\n\nvery  cause he  had labored  to  promote.

Intent.\r                              \r\n\nwhen an  alleged infringer  intentionally copies a  trademark, it\r\n\nmay be presumed that  she intended to cause confusion  and profit\r\n\nthereby.10  See Sullivan, 867 F.2d at 34.  But the presumption is\r                                  \r\n\ninapposite in situations where there is no persuasive evidence of\r\n\nany intent  to use the mark to suggest official sponsorship.

In addition,\r\n\nthe  fake invoice itself  includes what amounts  to a conspicuous\r\n\ndisclaimer.   Under  the circumstances, no  reasonable factfinder\r\n\ncould    conclude,     notwithstanding    Winship's    purposeful\r\n\nmisappropriation  of  the  IAM  service mark,  that  the  company\r\n\nintended to mislead employees about the source of the handouts.\r\n\n          8.

Because  the Union  has utterly\r                     \r\n\nfailed to  produce evidence sufficient  to meet that  burden, see\r                                                                           \r\n\nsupra, the mark's strength cannot carry the day.\r               \r\n\n                                E\r                                          E\r\n\n          After giving due weight  to each factor and considering\r\n\nthe unique circumstances that necessarily inform our analysis, we\r\n\nfind no  colorable  basis for  a  likelihood of  confusion,  and,\r\n\nhence,  no trialworthy  Lanham  Act  claim.    In  reaching  this\r\n\nconclusion  we stress  the significance  of the  factual setting.\r\n\nHere, the ambiance powerfully influenced the impression  conveyed\r\n\n                                24\r\r\n\nby  Winship's  unauthorized use  of the  IAM  service mark.   The\r\n\nparties'  preparations for  the  election  inflamed the  historic\r\n\nenmity   between   labor   and   management   and   colored   the\r\n\ncommunications distributed  by  both protagonists.   The  climate\r\n\ninevitably conditioned  voters to view with  suspicion any claims\r\n\nmade  by either  party about  the other.   This  suspicion peaked\r\n\nshortly  before  the election,  and  that is  when  the offending\r\n\ndocuments surfaced.  Moreover, the documents, when received, were\r\n\naffixed  to clearly  identifiable management  propaganda.   These\r\n\nadditional, relevant circumstances  counsel persuasively  against\r\n\nany realistic possibility of confusion as to \r\n\nthe source or sponsorship of the mismarked literature.\r\n\nIV.  CONCLUSION\r          IV.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          Considering  the  record  as  a  whole  in  the  light  most\r\n\nfavorable  to the  summary judgment  loser, we hold  that there  is no\r\n\ntriable issue of  fact as to  likelihood of confusion.   It is  simply\r\n\ninconceivable that employees who received the challenged literature at\r\n\nthe height  of a  fiercely disputed  union organizing  campaign would,\r\n\nupon  even  a cursory  glance,  be  apt  to  believe that  IAM  either\r\n\ndistributed or contributed in any meaningful way to these vociferously\r\n\nanti-union tracts.\r\n\n          We add a postscript.  The employer wins this appeal, but not\r\n\nour   admiration.     While  we   strongly  disapprove   of  Winship's\r\n\nmisappropriation of IAM's service  mark, however, the Union has  other\r\n\navailable remedies to redress  that infraction.  See, e.g.,  Linn, 383\r                                                                           \r\n\nU.S. at  61 (approving  state-law remedy in  analogous circumstances).\r\n\n                                  25\r\r\n\nFor  our  part, we  are  unwilling  to  stretch the  Lanham  Act  into\r\n\nunfamiliar contours simply for  the sake of punishing conduct  that we\r\n\ndeplore.   While  we are  not  willing to  venture quite  as far  into\r\n\nuncharted waters as our  concurring colleague   after all,  unlike the\r\n\nauthorities  on  which  she  primarily  relies,  see post,  this  case\r                                                                   \r\n\ninvolves  neither a  political  campaign nor  a  parody    the  policy\r\n\nconcerns  that undergird  her views  fortify our  resolve to  hold the\r\n\nline.   By  like token,  the special  circumstances that  the district\r\n\ncourt described at length,  see IAM, 914 F. Supp. at  653-56   such as\r                                             \r\n\nthe noncommercial nature of  the unauthorized use, the absence  of any\r\n\ncompetition  between  the  parties  in  the representational  services\r\n\nmarket, and the fact that Winship did not appropriate the mark for use\r\n\n\"in  connection with\"  any services  of its  own    point in  the same\r\n\ndirection.11  We need go no further.\r\n\nAffirmed.\r          Affirmed.\r                  \r\n\n                      Concurring Opinion Follows  \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     11We  take no  view  of the  concurring opinion's  suggested\r\nholding,  the grounds on  which the  district court  premised its\r\nruling, or  the other theories urged by Winship in support of the\r\njudgment  below.

We affirm, albeit  on a\r\n\ndifferent ground.\r\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          We present the basic facts in the light most flattering\r\n\nto  the party vanquished by  summary judgment.   All the relevant\r\n\nevents occurred in 1994, and all dates refer to that year.\r\n\n                                A\r                                          A\r\n\n          In May  the Union  mounted a  campaign to organize  the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1An IAM  official, Dale Hartford,  is also a  plaintiff, and\r\ntwo affiliates  of Winship (Hillhaven Corp.  and First Healthcare\r\nCorp.) are codefendants.  Since the  presence of these additional\r\nparties  does not  affect  the issues  on  appeal, we  treat  the\r\nlitigation  as  if it  involved  only  the  Union (as  plaintiff-\r\nappellant) and Winship (as defendant-appellee).\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nnonprofessional employees  at Winship's facility in  Bath, Maine.\r\n\nNot   surprisingly,  management  resisted   this  initiative  and\r\n\nexhorted the affected employees to vote against IAM's election as\r\n\na collective bargaining  representative.  As  part of its  retort\r\n\nWinship  hand-delivered  two  pieces  of  campaign  literature to\r\n\nemployees in the putative  bargaining unit.  These handouts  form\r\n\nthe basis for IAM's lawsuit.\r\n\n          1.  The  First Flier.   In July  Winship distributed  a\r                    1.  The  First Flier.\r                                        \r\n\nthree-page flier, the first page of which asks rhetorically:\r\n\n          WHAT  WOULD YOU  DO IF  YOU GOT  THE ATTACHED\r\n          LETTERS?\r\n          WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO FIND ANOTHER JOB?\r\n          HOW WOULD YOU PAY YOUR BILLS?\r\n          WOULD YOU WISH THAT THE MACHINISTS UNION  HAD\r\n          NEVER GOTTEN IN AT WINSHIP GREEN?\r\n\nThe  flier then advises recipients  that \"IT'S NOT  TOO LATE\" and\r\n\nimplores them  to \"GIVE  [certain  named managers]  A CHANCE\"  by\r\n\n\"VOT[ING] NO ON  AUGUST 4.\"  The  letters, addressed individually\r\n\nto particular  employees and dated  one year after  the scheduled\r                                                            \r\n\nelection, comprise the second and third pages of the flier.   One\r\n\nletter purports to be written on the Union's letterhead, complete\r\n\nwith a reproduction of the IAM service mark  (consisting of a set\r\n\nof  machinist's tools surrounded by a gear and the IAM name)2 and\r\n\nthe facsimile signature of an IAM plenipotentiary, Dale Hartford.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2Service marks  and  trademarks  function  to  identify  the\r\nsource  of  services and  goods,  respectively.   The  difference\r\nbetween the  two types of marks is not relevant here, and thus we\r\nwill apply case law involving either form.  See Star Fin.

The other epistle, signed by Winship's director\r\n\nof  operations, is  also  postdated.   It acknowledges  Winship's\r\n\nreceipt  of the notice and professes to inform the addressee that\r\n\nthe company must honor the Union's request.\r\n\n          2.   The Second Flier.  The remaining piece of campaign\r                    2.   The Second Flier.\r                                         \r\n\nliterature,  disseminated  by  Winship  a  few  days  before  the\r\n\nelection, urges the reader to vote against unionization and warns\r\n\nthat union  membership will bring  significant financial burdens.\r\n\nThis  flier  contains  a  simulated  invoice  inscribed  on  what\r\n\npurports  to be IAM's letterhead (and which bears the IAM service\r\n\nmark).  Under  a heading  that reads \"PAYABLE  TO THE  MACHINISTS\r\n\nUNION BY [employee's name]\", the invoice lists amounts designated\r\n\nas  union  dues, an  initiation  fee,  and  fines.3   Commentary,\r\n\nundiluted by subtlety, accompanies this listing:  \"NO MATTER WHAT\r\n\nTHE  UNION HAS  TOLD  YOU    JUST ASK  THE  EMPLOYEES AT  LOURDES\r\n\nHOSPITAL\" AND \"JUST ASK  THE 13 EMPLOYEES AT GENERAL  ELECTRIC IN\r\n\nSOUTH PORTLAND  WHO  WERE  FINED  FOR CROSSING  THE  PICKET  LINE\r\n\nTHERE.\"    Large,  bold letters  at  the  bottom  of the  invoice\r\n\nproclaim:  \"WITHOUT THE MACHINISTS UNION, DO NOT PAY THIS BILL.\"\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3The  stated  amounts  are  not  only  apocryphal  but  also\r\nextravagant.    During  the   organizing  drive,  IAM  repeatedly\r\ndeclared  that there  would  be no  initiation  fee and  that  no\r\nworker's monthly dues would exceed $20.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\n          Notwithstanding Winship's tactics   or, perhaps, due to\r\n\nthem    the employees  chose IAM  as their  collective bargaining\r\n\nrepresentative in the August 4 election.\r\n\n                                B\r                                          B\r\n\n          The Union  proved to be a  sore winner.  It  soon filed\r\n\nsuit against Winship  alleging inter alia  trademark infringement\r                                                   \r\n\nand unfair competition under the Lanham Act.4  The Union premised\r\n\nits  federal claims on the theory that Winship's unauthorized use\r\n\nof the registered service mark occurred \"in connection with . . .\r\n\nservices,\" namely, IAM's  representational services, and  thereby\r\n\ntransgressed sections 32(1) and 43(a) of the  Lanham Act.  See 15\r                                                                        \r\n\nU.S.C.     1114(1)(a)  &amp;  1125(a) (quoted  infra  note 5).

This  appeal\r                               \r\n\nfollowed.\r\n\nII.  THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\r          II.  THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\r\n\n          Though the case  is unconventional,  the generic  legal\r\n\nstandard  that we  must apply  is prosaic.   Summary  judgment is\r\n\nappropriate in  trademark infringement cases,  as elsewhere,  \"if\r\n\nthe  pleadings,  depositions,  answers  to  interrogatories,  and\r\n\nadmissions on  file, together with  the affidavits, if  any, show\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4IAM's  complaint  also  embodied a  salmagundi  of  pendent\r\nstate-law  claims.   The  district court  dismissed these  claims\r\nwithout prejudice  coincident with the entry  of summary judgment\r\non  the federal  claims.   See  IAM,  914 F.  Supp. at  656.   We\r                                             \r\nunderstand  that the Union is pursuing these claims in a separate\r\nstate  court action.   Finally,  the complaint  sought injunctive\r\nrelief  under  the Norris-LaGuardia  Act,  29  U.S.C.     101-115\r\n(1994), but the Union now concedes the infirmity of this request.\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nthat  there is no genuine issue as  to any material fact and that\r\n\nthe moving party is entitled  to a judgment as a matter  of law.\"\r\n\nBoston  Athletic Ass'n  v.

Second, Rule  56 places a  special gloss upon  the usual\r\n\nanalytic approach.  On summary  judgment the reviewing court must\r\n\ndecide  whether the evidence as a whole, taken most hospitably to\r\n\nthe markholder,  generates a  triable issue  as to likelihood  of\r\n\nconfusion.   See Sullivan,  867 F.2d  at 29;  Astra, 718  F.2d at\r                                                             \r\n\n1205;  see also 3 McCarthy, supra,   23.11 (observing that, while\r                                           \r\n\nlegal  precedent governs the analysis, the result of each case is\r\n\ncontrolled by the totality of its facts).\r\n\n          Applying these  principles, we conclude that  the Union\r\n\nbears  the  burden  here  of adducing  \"significantly  probative\"\r\n\nevidence,  Anderson,  477  U.S.  at  249-50  (citation  omitted),\r                             \r\n\ntending to show that an appreciable number of  prospective voters\r\n\n(i.e., employees within the defined bargaining unit) were in fact\r\n\nlikely  to be confused or misled into believing that the service-\r\n\nmarked campaign  literature was produced, sent,  or authorized by\r\n\nIAM.  The Union has not reached this plateau.\r\n\n                                C\r                                          C\r\n\n          As  we set  the  scene  for  the  main  thrust  of  our\r\n\nanalysis,  we acknowledge that the campaign stump is an odd stage\r\n\nfor playing out  a Lanham Act  drama.  In the  typical commercial\r\n\nsetting, confusion as to  the source of goods or  services occurs\r\n\nwhen there is an unacceptably high risk that a buyer may purchase\r\n\none product or service in the mistaken belief that she is  buying\r\n\na different product  or service.  See, e.g., Star,  89 F.3d at 9.\r                                                           \r\n\nBut the instant case is well off  the beaten track.  It does  not\r\n\ninvolve  two entrepreneurs  vying to  sell competing  products or\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\nservices  in the traditional sense.   Rather, IAM  was angling to\r\n\nrepresent the workers and,  although Winship opposed that effort,\r\n\nit was neither offering nor seeking to provide a similar service.\r\n\nIn  the  vernacular of  the  marketplace, IAM  was  \"selling\" its\r\n\nservices to prospective union members and Winship was \"selling\" a\r\n\nnegative   the  lack of a need for any  such services or service-\r\n\nprovider.\r\n\n          This twist  has significant implications for  a court's\r\n\nassessment  of  the  likelihood  of confusion.    If  we  assume,\r\n\nfavorably to the  Union, that confusion as  to the source  of the\r\n\ndocuments bearing  the IAM service  mark may at  least indirectly\r\n\ndeter prospective purchasers (voters within the bargaining  unit)\r\n\nfrom acquiring (voting for) IAM's representational services, that\r\n\ndeterrent will exist only  if, and to the extent  that, confusion\r\n\ncauses  purchasers to be misinformed about the nature or value of\r\n\nthe  services.   We  think it  follows  inexorably that,  if  the\r\n\nelectorate  can readily  identify Winship  as  the source  of the\r\n\npromotional  materials,  the  deterrent  vanishes.

In that\r\n\nevent,  there is no misleading as to  the genesis of the letters,\r\n\nand the  voters can assess whether  the Winship-authored handouts\r\n\naccurately describe the Union's services, or, instead, are merely\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\na   manifestation  of  Winship's  no-holds-barred  commitment  to\r\n\ndissuade  the  voters  from  \"purchasing\" those  services.    Put\r\n\nanother  way, knowledge as to the source of the materials dispels\r\n\nincipient confusion.\r\n\n          The Union attempts to confess  and avoid.  It  contends\r\n\nthat  the recipients'  ability  to ascertain  the  source of  the\r\n\ndocuments does not necessarily negate confusion.  This contention\r\n\nhinges on the  theory that  employees may have  thought that  the\r\n\nletters,  even  if delivered  by  the  company, were  actual  IAM\r\n\ndocuments which  Winship procured  and then draped  in anti-union\r\n\ninvective.  But  that theory does not  fit the facts:   patently,\r\n\nthis  is neither  an  instance in  which an  employer distributes\r\n\ncopies  of a  notice  previously sent  by  a union  to  employees\r\n\nelsewhere  and adds anti-union  commentary, nor  one in  which an\r\n\nemployer makes minor emendations  to an authentic union document.\r\n\nThe  letters  and  the  invoice  are composed  around  names  and\r\n\ncircumstances  indigenous  to   this  particular   organizational\r\n\neffort.   Among other things, the letters bear a date significant\r\n\nin its  relation to  the  scheduled election;  they address  each\r\n\nWinship employee by name and home address; and they identify this\r\n\nemployer.   Source-identifiers specific  to the Winship  election\r\n\nare even more pervasive in the fictitious invoice.\r\n\n          The Union's fallback position seems to be that, even if\r\n\nit is nose-on-the-face plain that the letters and the invoice are\r\n\nnot  replicas of  genuine IAM  materials, the  affected employees\r\n\nstill may have believed  that they somehow were based  on genuine\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\nmaterials.  We think  this construct is both legally  unsound and\r\n\nfactually unsupported.

The  affidavit\r\n\nstates briefly  that \"several\"  employees asked  whether Hartford\r\n\nhad in fact written the letter that bore his signature.8  It also\r\n\nreports  that  one  employee  questioned  whether  she  would  be\r\n\nrequired to pay $300 in dues and a $200 initiation fee.  Hartford\r\n\nopines  that \"these figures  seem to have  had to have  come from\r\n\n[the apocryphal union invoice].\"   This evidence, standing alone,\r\n\nis insufficient to prove actual confusion.\r\n\n          The fundamental problem with  the Hartford affidavit is\r\n\nthat, even taking  its contents  as literally true,  it does  not\r\n\nundermine what is perfectly obvious from a reading of the record:\r\n\nno person of ordinary prudence  and normal intelligence, aware of\r\n\nwhat was happening around her, would have been confused as to the\r\n\nsource  or  sponsorship  of the  letters.    For  one thing,  the\r\n\ninquiries to which Hartford alludes reveal at most that employees\r\n\ndoubted whether he would have written a letter unfavorable to the\r\n\nvery  cause he  had labored  to  promote.   On their  face, these\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     8Although Hartford  recalled that these statements were made\r\nin front of approximately ten other employees at a union meeting,\r\nhe claimed that  he could not  locate the list of  attendees and,\r\nconsequently,  could not name either the persons who made inquiry\r\nof him or those who overheard the queries.\r\n\n                                20\r\r\n\ninquiries do not evince actual confusion as to the source of  the\r\n\njury-rigged  documents.

They must have known\r\n\nthat Winship distributed the fliers (which embodied the letters),\r\n\nand  they therefore  knew that  the letters had  to be  viewed in\r\n\nlight  of  Winship's motivation.

Regardless, this  lone inquiry    which  questioned the\r\n\nveracity  of  the prediction  concerning  union dues     does not\r                  \r\n\nindicate  confusion as to  the source of  the fictitious invoice.\r                                               \r\n\n                                21\r\r\n\nSee  Pignons,   657  F.2d  at  490   (finding  consumer's  letter\r                      \r\n\nexpressing  surprise at  perceived affiliation  between competing\r\n\ncompanies \"clearly insufficient\" to prove actual confusion).\r\n\n          The Union strives  to persuade us  that, no matter  how\r\n\npaltry  the  evidence  of  actual confusion,  it  is  nonetheless\r\n\nadequate  to survive  testing on  summary judgment where  we must\r\n\naccept all reasonable inferences favorable to  the nonmovant.

The\r\n\nparties'  preparations for  the  election  inflamed the  historic\r\n\nenmity   between   labor   and   management   and   colored   the\r\n\ncommunications distributed  by  both protagonists.   The  climate\r\n\ninevitably conditioned  voters to view with  suspicion any claims\r\n\nmade  by either  party about  the other.   This  suspicion peaked\r\n\nshortly  before  the election,  and  that is  when  the offending\r\n\ndocuments surfaced.  Moreover, the documents, when received, were\r\n\naffixed  to clearly  identifiable management  propaganda.   These\r\n\nadditional, relevant circumstances  counsel persuasively  against\r\n\nany realistic possibility of confusion as to \r\n\nthe source or sponsorship of the mismarked literature.\r\n\nIV.  CONCLUSION\r          IV.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          Considering  the  record  as  a  whole  in  the  light  most\r\n\nfavorable  to the  summary judgment  loser, we hold  that there  is no\r\n\ntriable issue of  fact as to  likelihood of confusion.   It is  simply\r\n\ninconceivable that employees who received the challenged literature at\r\n\nthe height  of a  fiercely disputed  union organizing  campaign would,\r\n\nupon  even  a cursory  glance,  be  apt  to  believe that  IAM  either\r\n\ndistributed or contributed in any meaningful way to these vociferously\r\n\nanti-union tracts.\r\n\n          We add a postscript.  The employer wins this appeal, but not\r\n\nour   admiration.     While  we   strongly  disapprove   of  Winship's\r\n\nmisappropriation of IAM's service  mark, however, the Union has  other\r\n\navailable remedies to redress  that infraction.  See, e.g.,  Linn, 383\r                                                                           \r\n\nU.S. at  61 (approving  state-law remedy in  analogous circumstances).\r\n\n                                  25\r\r\n\nFor  our  part, we  are  unwilling  to  stretch the  Lanham  Act  into\r\n\nunfamiliar contours simply for  the sake of punishing conduct  that we\r\n\ndeplore.

Because  this   evidence  that   the  company\r\n\nmisrepresented  the union's  services may  be sufficient  for the\r\n\nfact-finder to find confusion as to the \"nature, characteristics,\r\n\n[or]  qualities\"  of the  union's  services,  I would  not  allow\r\n\nsummary judgment for the company under prong (B) on the ground of\r\n\na lack of confusion.\r\n\n                               III\r                                         III\r\n\n          A  firm ground for summary judgment, it seems to me, is\r\n\nthat  the Lanham Act  creates no liability  because the deception\r\n\ndid not occur in connection with commercial sales or advertising,\r\n\nas required under the Act, but rather in campaign hand-outs.   \r\n\n          The Lanham Act protects only against certain commercial\r                                                                           \r\n\n                                31\r\r\n\nuses of trademarks.

Section 43(a) is likewise limited to\r\n\nuses of marks \"in commerce,\" 15 U.S.C.   1125(a)(1) (1994), which\r\n\nthe Act  defines as  using or  displaying a mark  in the  sale or\r\n\nadvertising  of goods or services,15 see 15 U.S.C.   1127 (1994).\r                                                  \r\n\nAnd, section 43(a)(1)(B) limits misrepresentation claims to those\r\n\ncases involving \"commercial advertising or promotion.\"  15 U.S.C.\r\n\n  1125(a)(1)(B) (1994).\r\n\n          While  there is  no appellate  case directly  on point,\r\n\ntrial  courts have rejected efforts  to extend the  Lanham Act to\r\n\ncases  where  the  defendant  is  not  using  or  displaying  the\r\n\ntrademark in the sale, distribution  or advertising of its  goods\r\n\nor services.
