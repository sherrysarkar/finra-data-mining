A jury found that appellant\n\nNationwide Mutual Insurance Company (\"Nationwide\") terminated\n\nappellees Manual Baralt and Juan Gonzalez-Perez (\"Gonzalez\")\n\nbecause    of   their   ages,   in   violation   of   both   the   Age\n\nDiscrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 621-634 (\"ADEA\"),\n\nand Puerto Rico Law 100, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, §§ 146-51 (\"Law\n\n100\").    The two men and their wives were awarded a total of more\n\nthan $6 million in damages and attorney's fees.        See Baralt v.\n\nNationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 86 F. Supp. 31, 42 (D.P.R. 2000).         On\n\nappeal, Nationwide does not challenge the jury's determination\n\nthat the company acted    unjustifiably in terminating appellees,\n\nbut contends that the evidence failed to support a finding of\n\nage discrimination.     After a careful review of the record and\n\ncaselaw, we agree, and therefore reverse.\n\n                        I. Factual Background\n\n    In the spring of 1993, Nationwide began an investigation\n\ninto allegations of fraudulent claims practices by one of its\n\nadjusters, Quinones, after appellee Baralt, claims manager in\n\nthe Puerto Rico office (\"NPRO\"), reported \"irregularities\" to\n\ncompany headquarters. Nationwide assigned Joanne McGoldrick, an\n\ninvestigator in its corporate security department, to research\n\nthe allegations.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f       During her investigation, which included three visits to\n\nPuerto Rico between October 1993 and April 1994, 1 McGoldrick\n\nlearned of unrelated improper conduct allegedly committed by the\n\nvice       president   of    the    office,    Enrique     Lopez.         Those\n\nimproprieties      primarily       concerned   the   unauthorized        use    of\n\ncompany cars, or \"pool\" cars, and salvage vehicles, including\n\nthe regular borrowing of pool cars by Lopez's sons and \"sales\"\n\nof salvage vehicles to NPRO employees who had not paid for them.\n\nLopez also was accused of procuring an insurance policy at less\n\nthan full cost for a Plymouth Sundance used by his son in Ohio\n\nby falsely representing that it was being driven by his wife in\n\nPuerto Rico.\n\n       McGoldrick initially verified the accusations against Lopez\n\nby speaking with NPRO’s Sales and Marketing Manager, Blanca\n\nRobles, and then further investigated the claims during her\n\nApril visit to Puerto Rico.          Nationwide maintains that appellees\n\nwere terminated in May 1994 because they interfered with the\n\ninvestigation      into     Lopez's    conduct   and     because    of    their\n\ninvolvement in certain of the asserted improper practices.                     The\n\ncompany claims that Gonzalez helped Lopez to obtain the Sundance\n\n\n\n       1\n      That probe eventually led Nationwide's auditors to suspect\nsubstantial   losses,  specifically,   that   Quinones  and   an\naccomplice had defrauded the company of $320,000 through\npayments for nonexistent property damage.\n\n                                      -4-\n\finsurance policy and also was aware of, and facilitated, the use\n\nof pool cars by Lopez's sons. Baralt was linked to the alleged\n\nimproprieties because he was in charge of salvage vehicles for\n\nNPRO.\n\n       Baralt, NPRO's claims manager, was 49 and had been employed\n\nby Nationwide for 25 years; Gonzalez, who was 60, had worked for\n\nthe company for 28 years and was manager of the personal and\n\ncommercial lines underwriting department.                  Baralt and Gonzalez\n\nwere two of the six high-ranking employees at NPRO known as the\n\n\"Cabinet.\" Two others — Lopez and the company's comptroller,\n\nLuis    Flores     Dieppa    (\"Flores\")      —    also   were    terminated      for\n\nimproper conduct.           The remaining two Cabinet members, one of\n\nwhom    was   Robles,   left    the    company     about    a    year    after   the\n\nterminations.       The only evidence presented at trial explaining\n\ntheir departures was Robles's testimony that she took advantage\n\nof   the    company's   early    retirement        plan.        Five    non-Cabinet\n\nemployees also were terminated.\n\n       At trial, in addition to presenting evidence of appellees'\n\ninvolvement in practices the company deemed improper, Nationwide\n\nattempted to show that both men interfered in the investigation\n\nafter      being   instructed    not   to    do    so.     McGoldrick       accused\n\nGonzalez of intimidating two female employees, whom she had\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\ffound crying.2   She also reported that on multiple occasions she\n\nfound   Gonzalez       standing   near    an   office   where   she     was\n\ninterviewing employees.           In a report admitted as a trial\n\nexhibit, McGoldrick stated that another employee told her that\n\nBaralt had contacted all of the claims division employees who\n\npossessed salvage vehicles \"and warned them of the scope of our\n\ninvestigation\" and advised them not to tell the truth or they\n\nwould   lose   their    jobs.     She    further   reported   that    other\n\nemployees had stated that Baralt had discussed the interview he\n\nhad with investigators even though he had been told expressly of\n\nthe requirement of confidentiality.3\n\n    Appellees sought to rebut Nationwide's evidence of improper\n\nconduct in a variety of ways.            They presented evidence that\n\nthere was no company policy against after-hours use of pool cars\n\n\n\n\n    2  The hearsay rule prevented McGoldrick from specifically\nrelating what the two employees said to her, but she testified\nthat, after the first such encounter, she went to Gonzalez's\noffice and said: \"Stay out of this investigation.       You're\nintimidating people, they're afraid to talk, they're crying.\"\nAfter the second encounter, she said she asked Gonzalez \"to\nplease refrain from contacting our people because it could be\nsubject   to   disciplinary  action   up  until  grounds   for\ntermination.\"\n    3  A Nationwide Human Resources officer, James Lucas,\ntestified that both Baralt and Gonzalez admitted during\ninterviews    that they had spoken to employees about the\ninvestigation, but both denied at trial that they had spoken to\ncoworkers about the inquiry.\n\n                                   -6-\n\fby family members,4 and that, moreover, giving Lopez's sons use\n\nof cars in the evening served to protect the vehicles from\n\npossible theft from the unsecured company lot, which was in a\n\nhigh-crime area.         Although Gonzalez acknowledged arranging the\n\nsons' use of the pool cars, he testified that he did so upon\n\ninstructions from another Cabinet member, Rafael Gonzalez, and\n\nfurther testified that it was Rafael who had responsibility over\n\nthe    pool      vehicles.     In     an    effort      to    negate    Nationwide's\n\nsuggestion that company officials permitted employees to acquire\n\nsalvage vehicles at no cost, plaintiffs also presented evidence\n\nthat       the   company's    books    showed      the       debts   for   the    cars.\n\nTestimony elicited on behalf of Gonzalez distanced him from the\n\ninsurance policy obtained by Lopez on the Plymouth Sundance by\n\nsuggesting that it was not issued under his authority, and there\n\nalso was evidence indicating that the policy was not improper.5\n\nAs noted, both plaintiffs denied that they had breached the\n\nconfidentiality of the investigation.                        Gonzalez defended his\n\nfrequent         appearance   near     the       room    where       McGoldrick     was\n\n\n\n       4\n       Robles testified that employees who used pool cars were\nrequired to obtain permission and record in a log the reason for\nthe use and the specific period of time the car was needed.\n       5\n      Plaintiffs’ counsel elicited evidence indicating that the\npolicy was renewed after the terminations, although Robles also\ntestified that Lopez was required to pay additional premiums for\n\"the discrepancies\" in the application.\n\n                                           -7-\n\fconducting interviews by explaining that he was using the nearby\n\ncopy machine, not intimidating employees.\n\n    Appellees also emphasized the abruptness and insensitivity\n\nexhibited in the circumstances leading up to and accompanying\n\nplaintiffs’ terminations.         After McGoldrick reported on her\n\ninvestigation   to   Nationwide        headquarters,   Lucas,   the   Human\n\nResources officer, was sent to Puerto Rico with final decision-\n\nmaking authority.      He had not reviewed plaintiffs’ personnel\n\nfiles,   claiming    that   he   did    not   want   his   decision   to   be\n\ninfluenced by anything in the files and noting that even a\n\nthirty-year record of good employment could be wiped out by one\n\nserious improper act.       He interviewed each plaintiff for only a\n\nbrief time, and, at the end of the interviews, pronounced his\n\ndecision to terminate.       Security personnel were standing by to\n\nescort each plaintiff with his personal belongings out of the\n\nbuilding.\n\n    The sum total of evidence relating to age is the following:\n\n    — Baralt, 49, was replaced by Morales, 47.             Although Baralt\n\nat first testified that Morales was replaced by \"a much younger\n\nman,\" he later admitted that he had no idea why Morales left the\n\ncompany or whether his replacement was younger or much younger.\n\n    — Gonzalez, 60, was replaced by Guzman, 43.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f    — Lopez, the NPRO vice president, 54, was temporarily\n\nreplaced by Robles, also 54, indeed three weeks older than\n\nLopez.   His permanent replacement was Jack Wood, whose age was\n\nnot made of record.\n\n    — Flores, NPRO’s comptroller, was 44 when he was terminated.\n\nThere is no evidence of his replacement's age.\n\n    — The two Cabinet members who were not fired were Robles,\n\n54, and Rafael Gonzalez, 57.\n\n    — In addition to the above four Cabinet members, there were\n\nfive subordinate employees discharged for misappropriation of\n\nvehicles.    Nothing appears in the record concerning their ages\n\nor those of any replacements.\n\n    When Gonzalez was asked directly what support he had for his\n\nage discrimination claim, he replied:\n\n                 Well, based on the performance that I was\n            realizing or that I was doing, my devotion to the\n            company, the success that the agency was having\n            every year, over 18 long years and always willing\n            to make a maximum effort to the company's\n            benefit, to the benefit of our customers. I was\n            in a good state of health, there was no reason.\n\n    The jury nonetheless found that age played a motivating role\n\nin the terminations of Gonzalez and Baralt in violation of both\n\nthe ADEA and Law 100, which prohibits employment discrimination\n\n\n\n\n                                -9-\n\fbased on a variety of factors, including age. 6              The jury also\n\nreturned a verdict for plaintiffs on a third count for unjust\n\ndismissal under Puerto Rico's \"Law 80,\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29,\n\n§§ 185a-185m, which prohibits discharges \"made by the mere whim\n\nof the employer or without cause relative to the proper and\n\nnormal operation of the establishment.\"           Id. at § 185b.       The\n\njury awarded Baralt $1 million in non-economic damages and\n\nGonzalez $1.5 million, plus $500,000 to each of their wives.\n\nThe district court modified these amounts by reducing the wives'\n\ndamages   to   $100,000   each   and   by   doubling   the    compensatory\n\nawards, as prescribed by Law 100, to $2 million (for Baralt) and\n\n$3 million (for Gonzalez).        The jury also awarded back pay in\n\nthe amount of $500,000 to Baralt and $400,000 to Gonzalez.\n\nPlaintiffs also were awarded more than $140,000 in attorney's\n\nfees, for a total of approximately $6.24 million.\n\n    The court, which had taken under advisement Nationwide’s\n\nmotion for judgment as a matter of law, ruled first that the\n\njury was entitled to find that the company's reasons for the\n\nterminations were pretexts.      Baralt, 86 F. Supp. at 37.        It then\n\ncited, as the evidentiary support for the jury finding of age\n\n\n\n    6  Law 100 also bars employment discrimination because of\nrace, color, gender, social or national origin, social position,\npolitical affiliation, political or religious ideology, and\nmarital status. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, § 146.\n\n                                  -10-\n\fdiscrimination,            testimony   by    Robles     that   Nationwide         had    a\n\ncompany-wide retirement plan of which she had taken advantage.7\n\nId.\n\n      On appeal, Nationwide challenges the district court's denial\n\nof its motion for judgment as a matter of law on the federal and\n\nCommonwealth age discrimination claims and further contends\n\nthat,     if   it     is    unsuccessful     in   overturning        the    liability\n\nfinding, the damage awards must be reduced because they are\n\nunsupported and excessive.                  Plaintiffs filed cross-appeals,\n\nclaiming that they are entitled to a higher amount of both\n\ndamages    and      attorney's     fees.      Our      disposition    in        favor   of\n\nNationwide       on    the    merits   makes      it    unnecessary        to    address\n\nplaintiffs' assertions or Nationwide's challenge to the amount\n\nof damages.\n\n                                  II. Discussion\n\n      The primary issue we face is whether the evidence was\n\nsufficient to support the jury's finding of age discrimination.\n\n\n\n      7 As we have elsewhere observed, an offer of early\nretirement is not, on its own, evidence of discriminatory\nanimus.    See Alvarez-Fonseca v. Pepsi Cola of Puerto Rico\nBottling Co., 152 F.3d 17, 27 (lst Cir. 1998); Vega v. Kodak\nCaribbean, Ltd., 3 F.3d 476, 480 (lst Cir. 1993). A fortiori,\nan early retirement plan embracing all of a company’s many\nbranches throughout the nation is even more distanced from proof\nof animus. Were this not so, a host of progressive companies\nwith such policies would be surprised to find themselves\nvulnerable to age discrimination suits.\n\n                                        -11-\n\fThe parties agree that, if we were to conclude that plaintiffs\n\nare not entitled to recover under Law 100, they also would have\n\nfailed to prove age discrimination under the ADEA because Law\n\n100    offers   a   \"significantly        more     favorable\"       standard      to\n\nplaintiffs than does the ADEA.            Cardona Jimenez v. Bancomercio\n\nde Puerto Rico, 174 F.3d 36, 42 (lst Cir. 1999).                    Our analysis\n\ntherefore begins with Law 100, and, because we conclude that\n\nplaintiffs have not shown a violation of that statute, it also\n\nends there.\n\n       Under Law 100, a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case\n\nof age discrimination by (1) demonstrating that he was actually\n\nor constructively discharged, and (2) alleging that the decision\n\nwas discriminatory.        Id.   If this minimal showing is made, the\n\nburden shifts to the employer to prove by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that it had \"just cause\" for its actions.                      Id. at 42-\n\n43; Alvarez-Fonseca v. Pepsi Cola of Puerto Rico Bottling Co.,\n\n152 F.3d 17, 28 (lst Cir. 1998).              If the employer establishes\n\njust   cause,   the   burden     of   proof    returns      to    the   plaintiff.\n\nBancomercio, 174 F.3d at 43.            If the employer fails to prove\n\njust   cause,   however,    it    bears      the   burden    of    proving   by    a\n\n\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fpreponderance   of   the   evidence    that   the   decision   was   not\n\nmotivated by age discrimination.       Id.8\n\n    Nationwide acknowledges that the record permitted the jury\n\nto find that Baralt and Gonzalez were terminated without just\n\ncause,9 requiring the company to prove that the dismissals were\n\nnot motivated by age-based animus.      The company asserts that the\n\ntotal lack of evidence suggestive of age bias, together with\n\nNationwide's substantial evidence of a non-pretextual inquiry\n\ninto improper activities at the Puerto Rico office, required the\n\n\n    8 The burden-shifting framework under the ADEA requires more\nof a showing by the plaintiff, beginning with the prima facie\ncase. See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-\n05 (1973); Suarez v. Pueblo Int'l, Inc., 229 F.3d 49, 53 (lst\nCir. 2000). To establish a prima facie case, the plaintiff must\nshow that: (1) he was at least 40 years old; (2) his job\nperformance   was  meeting   the   employer's   legitimate   job\nexpectations; (3) he was fired or suffered other adverse\nemployment action attributable to the employer; and (4) the\nemployer had a continuing need for the     same services he had\nbeen performing. Suarez, 229 F.3d at 53.     If this showing is\nmade, a presumption of discrimination attaches.     Bancomercio,\n174 F.3d at 41. The employer at that point need only articulate\na legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the termination to\nshift the burden back to the plaintiff to prove by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the employer's reason was a\npretext and that the real reason was age-based animus.       Id.\nAlthough the employer in this framework briefly has the burden\nof producing a legitimate reason for the discharge, the burden\nof persuasion always remains on the employee. Id.\n    9 Although the company states that it assumes only arguendo,\nfor purposes of the appeals, that the record supports such a\nfinding, the jury made the specific determination that the\ncompany had violated Law 80 by discharging each plaintiff\nwithout just cause.    The company did not appeal the Law 80\nverdicts.\n\n                                -13-\n\fjury to reject plaintiffs' Law 100 claims.                    We review de novo\n\nthe district court's contrary judgment, taking the facts in the\n\nlight most favorable to plaintiffs.               Id. at 41.     For Nationwide\n\nto    prevail,    we   must     conclude       that   \"there    is   no    legally\n\nsufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for\n\nthe plaintiff[s].\"       Id. at 40.\n\n      It is undisputed that the record contains no direct evidence\n\nof age discrimination, not even the sorts of stray remarks that\n\nare      suggestive      but     often     found      insufficient    to    prove\n\ndiscrimination in the absence of more meaningful evidence.                    See,\n\ne.g., Williams v. Raytheon Co., 220 F.3d 16, 18 (lst Cir. 2000)\n\n(rejecting       age   and     gender    claims       where    supervisor     told\n\ncolleagues that the company was run by \"old, white men,\" that\n\nshe intended to change the corporate culture, and would favor\n\nthe hiring of women and younger people);                 Shorette v. Rite Aid\n\nof Maine, Inc., 155 F.3d 8, 13 (lst Cir. 1998) (rejecting age\n\ndiscrimination claim where district manager had asked plaintiff\n\n\"how old he was and when he planned to retire\").\n\n      Although Gonzalez, who was 60, was replaced by someone\n\nsignificantly younger – a 43-year-old – that successor also was\n\nwithin the protected age group, diminishing the force of the age\n\ndifference as an indicator of bias.              This solitary fact gains no\n\nstrength from the evidence that Baralt's replacement was only\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\ftwo years his junior, a difference that is insufficient to\n\nsupport even a prima facie case of age discrimination.                          See\n\nRaytheon, 220 F.3d at 20.           Moreover, the two Cabinet members who\n\nwere not discharged also were over 40; Rafael Gonzalez was 57\n\nand Robles was 54.             Lopez, the office vice president, was\n\nimmediately succeeded by            Robles, who was slightly older than\n\nhe.     The   parties       have   not   identified    the   ages   of    Lopez's\n\nultimate replacement or the replacement for Flores, the fourth\n\nCabinet    member     who    was   terminated.     In   addition,        as   noted\n\nearlier, there was no evidence of the ages of the five lower-\n\nlevel     employees     who    were      terminated.     Thus,      plaintiffs'\n\naffirmative showing of age discrimination consisted entirely of\n\nthree facts: they were within the protected class, they were\n\nfired, and one of them was replaced by someone significantly\n\nyounger — though that individual was still within the protected\n\nage group.\n\n      Nationwide's rationale for the firings, on the other hand,\n\nwas far from compelling.           Taken in the light most favorable to\n\nplaintiffs, the company's position was that the two men – each\n\nwith more than two decades of apparently high quality service to\n\nthe company – were terminated summarily for (1) their peripheral\n\ninvolvement in a series of improper but relatively minor acts in\n\nwhich their boss and other employees had taken advantage of the\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\fcompany, and (2) their discussions with co-workers, in violation\n\nof instructions, about the investigation into those improper\n\nacts.   Moreover, as we have noted earlier, the circumstances\n\nsurrounding    the      terminations    executed      by   Lucas   gave    every\n\nappearance of an insensitive overreaction to a series of minor\n\ntransgressions.\n\n    We have no problem accepting that a jury reasonably could\n\nconclude   that     a   large,    reputable    company     would   not    act   as\n\nprecipitously as Nationwide could be found to have acted if its\n\nactual concern were the minor transgressions that it claimed\n\nunderlay the terminations.           In other words, we think the jury\n\nwas entitled to disbelieve Nationwide's stated reasons for the\n\nfirings.      Our    problem,     rather,    arises   from   the   absence      of\n\nevidence that would permit a conclusion that the actual reason\n\nfor the firings was plaintiffs' ages.              For, even in the face of\n\nLaw 100's presumption, we conclude that the evidence presented\n\nby Nationwide, in the context of the evidence presented by\n\nplaintiffs, was sufficient to meet its burden under Law 100 to\n\ndemonstrate    that     \"the     existence    of   discrimination    was    less\n\nprobable than its nonexistence,\" Belk Arce v. Martinez, 98\n\nJ.T.S. 92 (P.R. 1998), Official Translation at 16.\n\n    The    evidence        was     undisputed      that    Nationwide      began\n\ninvestigating the Puerto Rico office as a result of Baralt's\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\freport concerning Quinones's allegedly fraudulent conduct, and\n\nthat the specific probe leading to plaintiffs' dismissals was\n\ntriggered by a tip from someone in the office about Lopez's\n\npersonal use of a salvage vehicle.       Robles corroborated the tip\n\nfor McGoldrick before the investigator traveled to Puerto Rico\n\nin April 1994.    The inquiry into Lopez's actions led to Gonzalez\n\nand Baralt – the former because of his involvement with the\n\nfraudulent automobile policy and the pool cars, and the latter\n\nbecause he was responsible for salvage vehicles.\n\n    That    the   investigation   unquestionably    was   triggered   by\n\nemployees in the Puerto Rico office, rather than by the home\n\noffice executives who carried out the terminations, makes it\n\nunlikely that the inquiry was fabricated as a ruse to accomplish\n\nage-based    terminations.        Moreover,   the    fact    that     the\n\ninvestigation was launched in 1993 rules out any rational theory\n\nthat it was conceived as a device to target plaintiffs, each of\n\nwhom had received letters of commendation in early 1994.10             A\n\ncompany seeking pretextual reasons to discharge employees on the\n\nbasis of their advancing ages would be unlikely to offer thanks\n\n\n\n\n    10  Both received letters dated March 4, 1994, from the\nsenior vice president for business operations, William P.\nDeMeno, with information about their payments under the 1993\nManagement Incentive Plan.\n\n                                  -17-\n\ffor those employees' \"efforts and contributions to the successes\n\nof this past year.\"\n\n       Plaintiffs     presented      no     evidence     to    discredit    the\n\nauthenticity of the investigation.            While, as we have noted, the\n\ncallous severity of the punishment in all likelihood moved\n\njurors to doubt that the discharges occurred for the stated\n\nreasons, the evidence was substantial that the firings were in\n\nsome way a byproduct of the home office probe into the Puerto\n\nRico operations.      On this record, various investigation-related\n\nexplanations for terminating plaintiffs were much more likely\n\nthan    the   completely     unsubstantiated       age    bias   asserted    by\n\nplaintiffs: Nationwide may have sought to clean house at the\n\nhighest   levels     of   NPRO's     management    after      concluding   that\n\n\"business     as    usual\"   there    did    not   satisfy     the   company's\n\nstandards; it may have interpreted reports from McGoldrick as\n\nwell as the auditors as indicating a widespread laxness and\n\ninvitation to corruption that had to be wiped out; the company\n\nmay have decided to terminate any manager who failed to comply\n\nfully with the investigation as a show of authority to assure\n\nfidelity on the part of branch supervisors; the Human Resources\n\nofficer, Lucas, may have felt the need to justify the time and\n\nexpense of the investigation by terminating a sufficiently large\n\nnumber of employees, whether or not they in fact committed\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\fwrongdoing, or he may simply have lost perspective and acted\n\nrashly.   None of these reasons would support liability under Law\n\n100.\n\n       In sum, with virtually no evidence besides the discharges\n\nthemselves pointing to age as a factor and none indicating that\n\nthe investigation was fabricated by company officials to conceal\n\nother motives, a reasonable jury could not entirely reject the\n\ncompany's    abundant     evidence     that   the   terminations      stemmed,\n\nhowever unwisely, from the investigation.               Even under Law 100's\n\npro-plaintiff system of shifting burdens, Baralt and Gonzalez\n\ncould not prevail with the mere allegation of age bias that\n\nestablished their prima facie case once Nationwide presented\n\nuncontroverted evidence of a real, if overly aggressive, inquiry\n\ninto office protocols.         Cf.       Bancomercio, 174 F.3d at 42-43\n\n(reversing jury verdict for plaintiff under Law 100 where \"the\n\nclosest approximation to evidence of age discrimination was the\n\nbasic fact that [plaintiff] was over 40 when fired and was\n\nreplaced by someone slightly under 40\").\n\n       Nationwide's   burden      to    defeat   the    presumption    was   to\n\n\"present evidence of sufficient quality to convince the judge\n\nthat the existence of discrimination was less probable than its\n\nnonexistence,\" Belk Arce, Official Translation at 16; Ibanez v.\n\nMolinos     de   Puerto   Rico,    114    D.P.R.       42   (1983),   Official\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\fTranslation at 75-76.

Ibanez, Official Translation at 72\n\n(\"For the presumption to be rebutted it suffices that [the\n\nemployer] proves, even through circumstantial evidence, that the\n\nmotive for the discharge was not discriminatory.\") (emphasis in\n\noriginal).        Plaintiffs'      efforts     to    counter      Nationwide's\n\nsubstantial evidence of a genuine investigation with proof that\n\nthey did little or nothing wrong shores up their claim for\n\nunjust dismissal, but such evidence is not on its own probative\n\nof    age    discrimination.       Cf.   Feliciano    de    la    Cruz   v.    El\n\nConquistador Resort and Country Club, 218 F.3d 1, 9 (lst Cir.\n\n2000) (affirming summary judgment against plaintiff on claim of\n\nnational      origin   discrimination    because     \"if   we     remanded    for\n\ntrial, the jury 'would be left to guess at the reasons behind\n\nthe pretext'\" (citation omitted)); Ibanez, Official Translation\n\nat 77 (reversing trial judge's finding of discrimination under\n\nLaw 100 where plaintiff offered only \"speculative\" argument that\n\nshe    was    discharged   based    on   age   rather      than    because     of\n\nconfidentiality breach).11\n\n\n       11\n      The strength of Nationwide's evidence of a legitimate\ninvestigation distinguishes this case from Reeves v. Sanderson\nPlumbing Prods., Inc., 120 S. Ct. 2097, 2104 (2000), in which\nthe Supreme Court upheld a jury's finding of an ADEA violation\nbased on plaintiff's prima facie case and \"sufficient evidence\nfor  a   reasonable  factfinder   to  reject   the  employer's\nnondiscriminatory explanation for its decision.\" Although Law\n\n                                     -20-\n\f      We have intently scrutinized the Puerto Rico cases cited to\n\nus to see what light they shed on a record as bereft of indicia\n\nof   discriminatory       intent      as    this.         In    every    case    we   have\n\nexamined,   there       was    some   evidence          of     discriminatory     intent\n\nbeyond the allegations necessary to make a prima facie case of\n\ndiscrimination.         In    Casto Soto v.             Caribe Hilton Hotel, 137\n\nD.P.R. 294 (1994), Official Translation at 12-13, the court\n\nnoted   that    plaintiff       not   only        had    rebutted       the   employer’s\n\nproffered      reason    for    termination,             but    also    had     submitted\n\nevidence of the dominating presence of under-40 personnel and\n\nthe company's efforts to create unfavorable disciplinary records\n\nfor its older employees.           In Belk Arce, Official Translation at\n\n10-11, there was a consultant's report indicating anti-marriage\n\nanimus within the defendant law firm, as well as a partner’s\n\n\n\n100 differs from the ADEA in that the defendant bears the burden\nof disproving discrimination, the factors we consider in\nassessing the evidence are the same:\n\n      the strength of the plaintiff's prima facie case, the\n      probative value of the proof that the employer's\n      explanation is false, and any other evidence that\n      supports the employer's case and that properly may be\n      considered on a motion for judgment as a matter of\n      law.\n\nId. at 2109. Here, as we have explained, consideration of these\nfactors, including the failure of plaintiffs' evidence to \"shed\nany light on . . . [the employer's] true reason for firing\"\nthem, Feliciano de la Cruz, 218 F.3d at 8, reveals \"the\nparticular weakness\" of plaintiffs' case, id. at 10.\n\n                                           -21-\n\fspecific anti-marriage statement referring to plaintiffs.                In\n\nSandoval v.     Caribe Hilton Int'l, 99 J.T.S. 166 (P.R. 1999),\n\nOfficial Translation at 4, 6, the plaintiff introduced evidence\n\nthat new management had instructed supervisors to exert pressure\n\non older workers to retire.12\n\n       In a leading case in which the court reversed a judgment for\n\nplaintiff,    Ibanez, Official Translation at 76-77, we find a\n\nconcatenation of circumstances similar to those present here: a\n\nqualified 63-year-old plaintiff, replaced by a 20-year-old, then\n\na 28-year-old, and finally a 57-year-old individual; and a five-\n\nweek delay between the occasion relied on as the cause of\n\ndischarge (impermissibly viewing confidential records) and the\n\nactual termination.         In other words, a prima facie case had been\n\nmade    and   there   was    a   basis   for   rejecting   the   employer’s\n\nexplanation.      But there was no evidence of animus.             Five of\n\ntwelve executive secretaries in plaintiff’s class were over 40,\n\nplaintiff herself had been 60 when hired, and, like plaintiffs\n\n\n\n\n       12\n       We note that Sandoval constitutes a \"judgment,\" rather\nthan an opinion of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, and therefore\ncarries no precedential value beyond the \"'intrinsic persuasive\nvalue of its rationale.'\" Clemente v. Carnicon-Puerto Rico Mgmt.\nAssocs., 52 F.3d 383, 389 n.6 (lst Cir. 1995) (quoting Rivera\nMaldonado v. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 119 D.P.R. 74 (1987)\n(Official English Translation, No. R-85-117, slip op. at 4-\n5)),abrogated on other grounds by United States v. Gray, 199\nF.3d 547 (lst Cir. 1999).\n\n                                     -22-\n\fin the case at bar, she had been looked on favorably up until\n\nthe incident in question.\n\n      Having canvassed both the record and caselaw, we conclude\n\nthat a decision holding that the requirements of Law 100 were\n\nmet by the facts of this case would extend the statute far\n\nbeyond its intended reach. If this record were enough, the\n\nresult would be a virtual merging of Law 80, which bars unjust\n\ndismissals, with Law 100. Notwithstanding Law 100's presumption,\n\nproof of unjust cause cannot suffice to establish liability\n\nwhere there is considerable evidence of a non-discriminatory\n\nreason for the discharge and no evidence of age bias other than\n\nthe employee's age.    That this must be so is evident when one\n\nconsiders the hypothetical claim allowable under Law 100 of a\n\nminority woman over the age of 40 who alleges race, gender, and\n\nage   discrimination   in   a   termination   arising   from   similar\n\ncircumstances.   Without the need for some evidence linked to the\n\nparticular animus, she could recover on any, or all, of her\n\ntheories by virtue of her protected status.      The jury's verdict\n\nwould be both speculative and unsupported with respect to each\n\nclaim.\n\n      Plaintiffs may well have been terminated too precipitously,\n\nbut we conclude that Nationwide met its burden to demonstrate,\n\n\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\fby a preponderance of the evidence, that Baralt and Gonzalez\n\nwere not fired on account of age.\n\n    The judgments for plaintiffs on the age discrimination\n\ncounts are therefore reversed, the award of attorney’s fees is\n\nvacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings as\n\nnecessary to enter judgment in connection with the claim for\n\nunjust dismissal under Law 80.\n\n\n\n\n                             -24-\n\f",

On\n\nappeal, Nationwide does not challenge the jury's determination\n\nthat the company acted    unjustifiably in terminating appellees,\n\nbut contends that the evidence failed to support a finding of\n\nage discrimination.     After a careful review of the record and\n\ncaselaw, we agree, and therefore reverse.\n\n                        I. Factual Background\n\n    In the spring of 1993, Nationwide began an investigation\n\ninto allegations of fraudulent claims practices by one of its\n\nadjusters, Quinones, after appellee Baralt, claims manager in\n\nthe Puerto Rico office (\"NPRO\"), reported \"irregularities\" to\n\ncompany headquarters. Nationwide assigned Joanne McGoldrick, an\n\ninvestigator in its corporate security department, to research\n\nthe allegations.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f       During her investigation, which included three visits to\n\nPuerto Rico between October 1993 and April 1994, 1 McGoldrick\n\nlearned of unrelated improper conduct allegedly committed by the\n\nvice       president   of    the    office,    Enrique     Lopez.         Those\n\nimproprieties      primarily       concerned   the   unauthorized        use    of\n\ncompany cars, or \"pool\" cars, and salvage vehicles, including\n\nthe regular borrowing of pool cars by Lopez's sons and \"sales\"\n\nof salvage vehicles to NPRO employees who had not paid for them.\n\nLopez also was accused of procuring an insurance policy at less\n\nthan full cost for a Plymouth Sundance used by his son in Ohio\n\nby falsely representing that it was being driven by his wife in\n\nPuerto Rico.\n\n       McGoldrick initially verified the accusations against Lopez\n\nby speaking with NPRO’s Sales and Marketing Manager, Blanca\n\nRobles, and then further investigated the claims during her\n\nApril visit to Puerto Rico.          Nationwide maintains that appellees\n\nwere terminated in May 1994 because they interfered with the\n\ninvestigation      into     Lopez's    conduct   and     because    of    their\n\ninvolvement in certain of the asserted improper practices.                     The\n\ncompany claims that Gonzalez helped Lopez to obtain the Sundance\n\n\n\n       1\n      That probe eventually led Nationwide's auditors to suspect\nsubstantial   losses,  specifically,   that   Quinones  and   an\naccomplice had defrauded the company of $320,000 through\npayments for nonexistent property damage.\n\n                                      -4-\n\finsurance policy and also was aware of, and facilitated, the use\n\nof pool cars by Lopez's sons. Baralt was linked to the alleged\n\nimproprieties because he was in charge of salvage vehicles for\n\nNPRO.\n\n       Baralt, NPRO's claims manager, was 49 and had been employed\n\nby Nationwide for 25 years; Gonzalez, who was 60, had worked for\n\nthe company for 28 years and was manager of the personal and\n\ncommercial lines underwriting department.                  Baralt and Gonzalez\n\nwere two of the six high-ranking employees at NPRO known as the\n\n\"Cabinet.\" Two others — Lopez and the company's comptroller,\n\nLuis    Flores     Dieppa    (\"Flores\")      —    also   were    terminated      for\n\nimproper conduct.           The remaining two Cabinet members, one of\n\nwhom    was   Robles,   left    the    company     about    a    year    after   the\n\nterminations.       The only evidence presented at trial explaining\n\ntheir departures was Robles's testimony that she took advantage\n\nof   the    company's   early    retirement        plan.        Five    non-Cabinet\n\nemployees also were terminated.\n\n       At trial, in addition to presenting evidence of appellees'\n\ninvolvement in practices the company deemed improper, Nationwide\n\nattempted to show that both men interfered in the investigation\n\nafter      being   instructed    not   to    do    so.     McGoldrick       accused\n\nGonzalez of intimidating two female employees, whom she had\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\ffound crying.2   She also reported that on multiple occasions she\n\nfound   Gonzalez       standing   near    an   office   where   she     was\n\ninterviewing employees.           In a report admitted as a trial\n\nexhibit, McGoldrick stated that another employee told her that\n\nBaralt had contacted all of the claims division employees who\n\npossessed salvage vehicles \"and warned them of the scope of our\n\ninvestigation\" and advised them not to tell the truth or they\n\nwould   lose   their    jobs.     She    further   reported   that    other\n\nemployees had stated that Baralt had discussed the interview he\n\nhad with investigators even though he had been told expressly of\n\nthe requirement of confidentiality.3\n\n    Appellees sought to rebut Nationwide's evidence of improper\n\nconduct in a variety of ways.            They presented evidence that\n\nthere was no company policy against after-hours use of pool cars\n\n\n\n\n    2  The hearsay rule prevented McGoldrick from specifically\nrelating what the two employees said to her, but she testified\nthat, after the first such encounter, she went to Gonzalez's\noffice and said: \"Stay out of this investigation.       You're\nintimidating people, they're afraid to talk, they're crying.\"\nAfter the second encounter, she said she asked Gonzalez \"to\nplease refrain from contacting our people because it could be\nsubject   to   disciplinary  action   up  until  grounds   for\ntermination.\"\n    3  A Nationwide Human Resources officer, James Lucas,\ntestified that both Baralt and Gonzalez admitted during\ninterviews    that they had spoken to employees about the\ninvestigation, but both denied at trial that they had spoken to\ncoworkers about the inquiry.\n\n                                   -6-\n\fby family members,4 and that, moreover, giving Lopez's sons use\n\nof cars in the evening served to protect the vehicles from\n\npossible theft from the unsecured company lot, which was in a\n\nhigh-crime area.         Although Gonzalez acknowledged arranging the\n\nsons' use of the pool cars, he testified that he did so upon\n\ninstructions from another Cabinet member, Rafael Gonzalez, and\n\nfurther testified that it was Rafael who had responsibility over\n\nthe    pool      vehicles.     In     an    effort      to    negate    Nationwide's\n\nsuggestion that company officials permitted employees to acquire\n\nsalvage vehicles at no cost, plaintiffs also presented evidence\n\nthat       the   company's    books    showed      the       debts   for   the    cars.\n\nTestimony elicited on behalf of Gonzalez distanced him from the\n\ninsurance policy obtained by Lopez on the Plymouth Sundance by\n\nsuggesting that it was not issued under his authority, and there\n\nalso was evidence indicating that the policy was not improper.5\n\nAs noted, both plaintiffs denied that they had breached the\n\nconfidentiality of the investigation.                        Gonzalez defended his\n\nfrequent         appearance   near     the       room    where       McGoldrick     was\n\n\n\n       4\n       Robles testified that employees who used pool cars were\nrequired to obtain permission and record in a log the reason for\nthe use and the specific period of time the car was needed.\n       5\n      Plaintiffs’ counsel elicited evidence indicating that the\npolicy was renewed after the terminations, although Robles also\ntestified that Lopez was required to pay additional premiums for\n\"the discrepancies\" in the application.\n\n                                           -7-\n\fconducting interviews by explaining that he was using the nearby\n\ncopy machine, not intimidating employees.\n\n    Appellees also emphasized the abruptness and insensitivity\n\nexhibited in the circumstances leading up to and accompanying\n\nplaintiffs’ terminations.         After McGoldrick reported on her\n\ninvestigation   to   Nationwide        headquarters,   Lucas,   the   Human\n\nResources officer, was sent to Puerto Rico with final decision-\n\nmaking authority.      He had not reviewed plaintiffs’ personnel\n\nfiles,   claiming    that   he   did    not   want   his   decision   to   be\n\ninfluenced by anything in the files and noting that even a\n\nthirty-year record of good employment could be wiped out by one\n\nserious improper act.       He interviewed each plaintiff for only a\n\nbrief time, and, at the end of the interviews, pronounced his\n\ndecision to terminate.       Security personnel were standing by to\n\nescort each plaintiff with his personal belongings out of the\n\nbuilding.\n\n    The sum total of evidence relating to age is the following:\n\n    — Baralt, 49, was replaced by Morales, 47.             Although Baralt\n\nat first testified that Morales was replaced by \"a much younger\n\nman,\" he later admitted that he had no idea why Morales left the\n\ncompany or whether his replacement was younger or much younger.\n\n    — Gonzalez, 60, was replaced by Guzman, 43.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f    — Lopez, the NPRO vice president, 54, was temporarily\n\nreplaced by Robles, also 54, indeed three weeks older than\n\nLopez.   His permanent replacement was Jack Wood, whose age was\n\nnot made of record.\n\n    — Flores, NPRO’s comptroller, was 44 when he was terminated.\n\nThere is no evidence of his replacement's age.\n\n    — The two Cabinet members who were not fired were Robles,\n\n54, and Rafael Gonzalez, 57.\n\n    — In addition to the above four Cabinet members, there were\n\nfive subordinate employees discharged for misappropriation of\n\nvehicles.    Nothing appears in the record concerning their ages\n\nor those of any replacements.\n\n    When Gonzalez was asked directly what support he had for his\n\nage discrimination claim, he replied:\n\n                 Well, based on the performance that I was\n            realizing or that I was doing, my devotion to the\n            company, the success that the agency was having\n            every year, over 18 long years and always willing\n            to make a maximum effort to the company's\n            benefit, to the benefit of our customers. I was\n            in a good state of health, there was no reason.\n\n    The jury nonetheless found that age played a motivating role\n\nin the terminations of Gonzalez and Baralt in violation of both\n\nthe ADEA and Law 100, which prohibits employment discrimination\n\n\n\n\n                                -9-\n\fbased on a variety of factors, including age. 6              The jury also\n\nreturned a verdict for plaintiffs on a third count for unjust\n\ndismissal under Puerto Rico's \"Law 80,\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29,\n\n§§ 185a-185m, which prohibits discharges \"made by the mere whim\n\nof the employer or without cause relative to the proper and\n\nnormal operation of the establishment.\"           Id. at § 185b.       The\n\njury awarded Baralt $1 million in non-economic damages and\n\nGonzalez $1.5 million, plus $500,000 to each of their wives.\n\nThe district court modified these amounts by reducing the wives'\n\ndamages   to   $100,000   each   and   by   doubling   the    compensatory\n\nawards, as prescribed by Law 100, to $2 million (for Baralt) and\n\n$3 million (for Gonzalez).        The jury also awarded back pay in\n\nthe amount of $500,000 to Baralt and $400,000 to Gonzalez.\n\nPlaintiffs also were awarded more than $140,000 in attorney's\n\nfees, for a total of approximately $6.24 million.\n\n    The court, which had taken under advisement Nationwide’s\n\nmotion for judgment as a matter of law, ruled first that the\n\njury was entitled to find that the company's reasons for the\n\nterminations were pretexts.

Plaintiffs filed cross-appeals,\n\nclaiming that they are entitled to a higher amount of both\n\ndamages    and      attorney's     fees.      Our      disposition    in        favor   of\n\nNationwide       on    the    merits   makes      it    unnecessary        to    address\n\nplaintiffs' assertions or Nationwide's challenge to the amount\n\nof damages.\n\n                                  II. Discussion\n\n      The primary issue we face is whether the evidence was\n\nsufficient to support the jury's finding of age discrimination.\n\n\n\n      7 As we have elsewhere observed, an offer of early\nretirement is not, on its own, evidence of discriminatory\nanimus.

This solitary fact gains no\n\nstrength from the evidence that Baralt's replacement was only\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\ftwo years his junior, a difference that is insufficient to\n\nsupport even a prima facie case of age discrimination.                          See\n\nRaytheon, 220 F.3d at 20.           Moreover, the two Cabinet members who\n\nwere not discharged also were over 40; Rafael Gonzalez was 57\n\nand Robles was 54.             Lopez, the office vice president, was\n\nimmediately succeeded by            Robles, who was slightly older than\n\nhe.     The   parties       have   not   identified    the   ages   of    Lopez's\n\nultimate replacement or the replacement for Flores, the fourth\n\nCabinet    member     who    was   terminated.     In   addition,        as   noted\n\nearlier, there was no evidence of the ages of the five lower-\n\nlevel     employees     who    were      terminated.     Thus,      plaintiffs'\n\naffirmative showing of age discrimination consisted entirely of\n\nthree facts: they were within the protected class, they were\n\nfired, and one of them was replaced by someone significantly\n\nyounger — though that individual was still within the protected\n\nage group.\n\n      Nationwide's rationale for the firings, on the other hand,\n\nwas far from compelling.           Taken in the light most favorable to\n\nplaintiffs, the company's position was that the two men – each\n\nwith more than two decades of apparently high quality service to\n\nthe company – were terminated summarily for (1) their peripheral\n\ninvolvement in a series of improper but relatively minor acts in\n\nwhich their boss and other employees had taken advantage of the\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\fcompany, and (2) their discussions with co-workers, in violation\n\nof instructions, about the investigation into those improper\n\nacts.   Moreover, as we have noted earlier, the circumstances\n\nsurrounding    the      terminations    executed      by   Lucas   gave    every\n\nappearance of an insensitive overreaction to a series of minor\n\ntransgressions.\n\n    We have no problem accepting that a jury reasonably could\n\nconclude   that     a   large,    reputable    company     would   not    act   as\n\nprecipitously as Nationwide could be found to have acted if its\n\nactual concern were the minor transgressions that it claimed\n\nunderlay the terminations.           In other words, we think the jury\n\nwas entitled to disbelieve Nationwide's stated reasons for the\n\nfirings.      Our    problem,     rather,    arises   from   the   absence      of\n\nevidence that would permit a conclusion that the actual reason\n\nfor the firings was plaintiffs' ages.              For, even in the face of\n\nLaw 100's presumption, we conclude that the evidence presented\n\nby Nationwide, in the context of the evidence presented by\n\nplaintiffs, was sufficient to meet its burden under Law 100 to\n\ndemonstrate    that     \"the     existence    of   discrimination    was    less\n\nprobable than its nonexistence,\" Belk Arce v. Martinez, 98\n\nJ.T.S. 92 (P.R. 1998), Official Translation at 16.\n\n    The    evidence        was     undisputed      that    Nationwide      began\n\ninvestigating the Puerto Rico office as a result of Baralt's\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\freport concerning Quinones's allegedly fraudulent conduct, and\n\nthat the specific probe leading to plaintiffs' dismissals was\n\ntriggered by a tip from someone in the office about Lopez's\n\npersonal use of a salvage vehicle.       Robles corroborated the tip\n\nfor McGoldrick before the investigator traveled to Puerto Rico\n\nin April 1994.    The inquiry into Lopez's actions led to Gonzalez\n\nand Baralt – the former because of his involvement with the\n\nfraudulent automobile policy and the pool cars, and the latter\n\nbecause he was responsible for salvage vehicles.\n\n    That    the   investigation   unquestionably    was   triggered   by\n\nemployees in the Puerto Rico office, rather than by the home\n\noffice executives who carried out the terminations, makes it\n\nunlikely that the inquiry was fabricated as a ruse to accomplish\n\nage-based    terminations.        Moreover,   the    fact    that     the\n\ninvestigation was launched in 1993 rules out any rational theory\n\nthat it was conceived as a device to target plaintiffs, each of\n\nwhom had received letters of commendation in early 1994.10             A\n\ncompany seeking pretextual reasons to discharge employees on the\n\nbasis of their advancing ages would be unlikely to offer thanks\n\n\n\n\n    10  Both received letters dated March 4, 1994, from the\nsenior vice president for business operations, William P.\nDeMeno, with information about their payments under the 1993\nManagement Incentive Plan.\n\n                                  -17-\n\ffor those employees' \"efforts and contributions to the successes\n\nof this past year.\"\n\n       Plaintiffs     presented      no     evidence     to    discredit    the\n\nauthenticity of the investigation.            While, as we have noted, the\n\ncallous severity of the punishment in all likelihood moved\n\njurors to doubt that the discharges occurred for the stated\n\nreasons, the evidence was substantial that the firings were in\n\nsome way a byproduct of the home office probe into the Puerto\n\nRico operations.      On this record, various investigation-related\n\nexplanations for terminating plaintiffs were much more likely\n\nthan    the   completely     unsubstantiated       age    bias   asserted    by\n\nplaintiffs: Nationwide may have sought to clean house at the\n\nhighest   levels     of   NPRO's     management    after      concluding   that\n\n\"business     as    usual\"   there    did    not   satisfy     the   company's\n\nstandards; it may have interpreted reports from McGoldrick as\n\nwell as the auditors as indicating a widespread laxness and\n\ninvitation to corruption that had to be wiped out; the company\n\nmay have decided to terminate any manager who failed to comply\n\nfully with the investigation as a show of authority to assure\n\nfidelity on the part of branch supervisors; the Human Resources\n\nofficer, Lucas, may have felt the need to justify the time and\n\nexpense of the investigation by terminating a sufficiently large\n\nnumber of employees, whether or not they in fact committed\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\fwrongdoing, or he may simply have lost perspective and acted\n\nrashly.   None of these reasons would support liability under Law\n\n100.\n\n       In sum, with virtually no evidence besides the discharges\n\nthemselves pointing to age as a factor and none indicating that\n\nthe investigation was fabricated by company officials to conceal\n\nother motives, a reasonable jury could not entirely reject the\n\ncompany's    abundant     evidence     that   the   terminations      stemmed,\n\nhowever unwisely, from the investigation.               Even under Law 100's\n\npro-plaintiff system of shifting burdens, Baralt and Gonzalez\n\ncould not prevail with the mere allegation of age bias that\n\nestablished their prima facie case once Nationwide presented\n\nuncontroverted evidence of a real, if overly aggressive, inquiry\n\ninto office protocols.         Cf.       Bancomercio, 174 F.3d at 42-43\n\n(reversing jury verdict for plaintiff under Law 100 where \"the\n\nclosest approximation to evidence of age discrimination was the\n\nbasic fact that [plaintiff] was over 40 when fired and was\n\nreplaced by someone slightly under 40\").\n\n       Nationwide's   burden      to    defeat   the    presumption    was   to\n\n\"present evidence of sufficient quality to convince the judge\n\nthat the existence of discrimination was less probable than its\n\nnonexistence,\" Belk Arce, Official Translation at 16; Ibanez v.\n\nMolinos     de   Puerto   Rico,    114    D.P.R.       42   (1983),   Official\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\fTranslation at 75-76.

In    every    case    we   have\n\nexamined,   there       was    some   evidence          of     discriminatory     intent\n\nbeyond the allegations necessary to make a prima facie case of\n\ndiscrimination.         In    Casto Soto v.             Caribe Hilton Hotel, 137\n\nD.P.R. 294 (1994), Official Translation at 12-13, the court\n\nnoted   that    plaintiff       not   only        had    rebutted       the   employer’s\n\nproffered      reason    for    termination,             but    also    had     submitted\n\nevidence of the dominating presence of under-40 personnel and\n\nthe company's efforts to create unfavorable disciplinary records\n\nfor its older employees.           In Belk Arce, Official Translation at\n\n10-11, there was a consultant's report indicating anti-marriage\n\nanimus within the defendant law firm, as well as a partner’s\n\n\n\n100 differs from the ADEA in that the defendant bears the burden\nof disproving discrimination, the factors we consider in\nassessing the evidence are the same:\n\n      the strength of the plaintiff's prima facie case, the\n      probative value of the proof that the employer's\n      explanation is false, and any other evidence that\n      supports the employer's case and that properly may be\n      considered on a motion for judgment as a matter of\n      law.\n\nId. at 2109. Here, as we have explained, consideration of these\nfactors, including the failure of plaintiffs' evidence to \"shed\nany light on . . . [the employer's] true reason for firing\"\nthem, Feliciano de la Cruz, 218 F.3d at 8, reveals \"the\nparticular weakness\" of plaintiffs' case, id. at 10.\n\n                                           -21-\n\fspecific anti-marriage statement referring to plaintiffs.                In\n\nSandoval v.     Caribe Hilton Int'l, 99 J.T.S. 166 (P.R. 1999),\n\nOfficial Translation at 4, 6, the plaintiff introduced evidence\n\nthat new management had instructed supervisors to exert pressure\n\non older workers to retire.12\n\n       In a leading case in which the court reversed a judgment for\n\nplaintiff,    Ibanez, Official Translation at 76-77, we find a\n\nconcatenation of circumstances similar to those present here: a\n\nqualified 63-year-old plaintiff, replaced by a 20-year-old, then\n\na 28-year-old, and finally a 57-year-old individual; and a five-\n\nweek delay between the occasion relied on as the cause of\n\ndischarge (impermissibly viewing confidential records) and the\n\nactual termination.         In other words, a prima facie case had been\n\nmade    and   there   was    a   basis   for   rejecting   the   employer’s\n\nexplanation.      But there was no evidence of animus.             Five of\n\ntwelve executive secretaries in plaintiff’s class were over 40,\n\nplaintiff herself had been 60 when hired, and, like plaintiffs\n\n\n\n\n       12\n       We note that Sandoval constitutes a \"judgment,\" rather\nthan an opinion of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, and therefore\ncarries no precedential value beyond the \"'intrinsic persuasive\nvalue of its rationale.'\" Clemente v.

If this record were enough, the\n\nresult would be a virtual merging of Law 80, which bars unjust\n\ndismissals, with Law 100. Notwithstanding Law 100's presumption,\n\nproof of unjust cause cannot suffice to establish liability\n\nwhere there is considerable evidence of a non-discriminatory\n\nreason for the discharge and no evidence of age bias other than\n\nthe employee's age.    That this must be so is evident when one\n\nconsiders the hypothetical claim allowable under Law 100 of a\n\nminority woman over the age of 40 who alleges race, gender, and\n\nage   discrimination   in   a   termination   arising   from   similar\n\ncircumstances.   Without the need for some evidence linked to the\n\nparticular animus, she could recover on any, or all, of her\n\ntheories by virtue of her protected status.      The jury's verdict\n\nwould be both speculative and unsupported with respect to each\n\nclaim.\n\n      Plaintiffs may well have been terminated too precipitously,\n\nbut we conclude that Nationwide met its burden to demonstrate,\n\n\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\fby a preponderance of the evidence, that Baralt and Gonzalez\n\nwere not fired on account of age.\n\n    The judgments for plaintiffs on the age discrimination\n\ncounts are therefore reversed, the award of attorney’s fees is\n\nvacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings as\n\nnecessary to enter judgment in connection with the claim for\n\nunjust dismissal under Law 80.\n\n\n\n\n                             -24-\n\f</pre>",
