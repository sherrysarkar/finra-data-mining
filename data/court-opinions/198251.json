MCCARTHY, a/k/a JAMES LEE HARDIMAN,\r\n                a/k/a JOHN EDWARD PERRY,\r\n\n                 Petitioner, Appellant,\r\n\n                           v.\r\n\n               UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\r\n\n                 Respondent, Appellee.\r\n\n      APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n               FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\r\n\n      [Hon. D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                Selya, Stahl and Lynch,\r\n                   Circuit Judges.\r\n\nAedan McCarthy on brief pro se.\r\nJay P. McCloskey, United States Attorney and Margaret D.\r\nMcGaughey, Assistant United States Attorney on brief for appellee.\r\n\nDecember 18, 1998\r\n\nPer Curiam.  Petitioner Aedan C. McCarthy was convicted of\r\nbank robbery and firearms offenses and sentenced as an armed career\r\ncriminal.  See U.S.S.G.  4B1.4 (1993).  We affirmed his\r\nconvictions and sentence.  United States v. McCarthy, 77 F.3d 522\r\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 479 (1996).\r\nMcCarthy now appeals the district court's denial of his\r\nsubsequent motion, filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  2255, only insofar\r\nas the district court refused to hold his  2255 motion in abeyance\r\nwhile McCarthy seeks to vacate prior convictions in state courts\r\nthat were the basis for his sentence as an armed career criminal. \r\nAlthough that  2255 motion raised claims about his federal\r\nconvictions, which were resolved by the district court and are no\r\nlonger pursued by McCarthy, McCarthy, in addition, sought to raise\r\nan, as yet, unripe claim regarding his status as an armed career\r\ncriminal.  Concerned about the one year period of limitation in \r\n2255 imposed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\r\nof 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-132, tit. I,  105 (1996), McCarthy\r\nincluded this unripe claim in his  2255 motion, but asked the\r\ncourt to hold his motion in abeyance pending the outcome of his\r\nstate court collateral attacks.\r\nWe find no abuse of discretion in the district court's refusal\r\nto hold the  2255 motion in abeyance.  In the event that McCarthy\r\nsucceeds in vacating his state court convictions, his contention\r\nthat the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) is inapplicable to him\r\nwould become ripe.  It would appear that, in that event and at that\r\ntime, he could seek to reopen this  2255 proceeding and obtain a\r\n\ndistrict court adjudication of that previously-raised claim.  See\r\nStewart v. Martinez-Villareal, 118 S. Ct. 1618, 1621-22 (1998)\r\n(holding that a claim presented in a first habeas petition and\r\ndismissed as premature could be adjudicated once it became ripe\r\nunder the same standard as would govern claims made in a first\r\npetition); see also United States v. Pettiford, 101 F.3d 199 (1st\r\nCir. 1996) (holding that once a defendant succeeds in vacating\r\nunderlying state court convictions, the ACCA is no longer\r\napplicable to the defendant's federal sentencing computation and he\r\nis entitled to be resentenced).\r\nThe judgment of the district court is, therefore, affirmed.\r\n",
