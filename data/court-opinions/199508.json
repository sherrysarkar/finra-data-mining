BURRELL, JR.,\n\n                       Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                 v.\n\nBOARD OF TRUSTEES FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF MAINE SYSTEM, ET AL.,\n\n                       Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                     FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\n\n         [Hon. David M. Cohen, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                      Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n              Bownes and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     William L.

Pattenaude, Terrence MacTaggert, James Stanhope,\nJolene Chonko, Tim Rich, Mike Mullett and Mike Gauthier.\n     Philip M. Coffin, III, Teresa M. Cloutier, and Lambert,\nCoffin, Rudman & Hochman on brief for appellees Jean Kaestner\nand Elizabeth Finlayson.\n\f                         JULY 10, 2001\n\n\n\n\n          Per Curiam.    After a thorough review of the record\n\nand of the parties’ submissions, we affirm.        We see no error\n\nin the lower court’s refusal to consider the prior versions\n\nof the complaint (a decision essentially denying the motions\n\nto amend), given the daunting task the court and the parties\n\nfaced in reviewing the voluminous submissions, Acosta-Mestre\n\nv. Hilton Int’l of Puerto Rico, Inc., 156 F.3d 49, 52 (1st\n\nCir. 1998); and the court did not err in refusing to allow\n\noral argument on the motion to dismiss.        Domegan v. Fair,\n\n859 F.2d 1059, 1065 (1 st Cir. 1988).     We disagree that the\n\ncourt misapplied the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 8 or\n\nthat it imposed a “heightened pleading standard.”\n\n          Appellant William L. Burrell Jr. (“Burrell”) has\n\nforfeited any substantive arguments in support of his claims\n\nbecause   he   failed   to   address   them   in   his   appellate\n\nsubmissions.    United States v. Fernandez, 145 F.3d 59, 63\n\n(1st Cir. 1998) (issues not fully addressed in appellate\n\nsubmissions are deemed forfeited).        Still, the court has\n\nreviewed Burrell’s substantive claims and, after reviewing\n\nthe entire record in this matter, we agree that his federal\n\n\n\n                               -2-\n\fclaims were subject to dismissal.       His due process claim\n\nfails because he failed to allege facts sufficient to show\n\na property interest in his job.     Krennerich v. Inhabitants\n\nof Town of Bristol, 943 F. Supp. 1345, 1352 (D. Me. 1996)\n\n(citations omitted) (in Maine, a public employee has no\n\nproperty   interest   sufficient   to   invoke   the   Fourteenth\n\nAmendment’s due process guarantees unless the applicable\n\nstatute or employment contract provides that employment may\n\nbe terminated only on a showing of ‘cause.’).            Even if\n\nBurrell’s contract of employment had provided him a property\n\ninterest in his job, Burrell received all the due process\n\nrequired by the Constitution.      Figueroa-Serrano v. Ramos-\n\nAlverio, 221 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir. 2000) (Due Process Clause\n\nrequires that individuals with a property interest in their\n\nemployment receive notice and a meaningful opportunity to\n\nrespond prior to termination).      There is no authority for\n\nBurrell’s suggestion that any post-termination review should\n\ninclude the right to cross-examine witnesses or the right to\n\na hearing within a certain amount of time.       Finally, even if\n\nBurrell had been denied due process prior to the decision to\n\nterminate him, Burrell failed to pursue state remedies that\n\nwere available to him.   Herwins v. City of Revere, 163 F.3d\n\n15, 20 (1st Cir. 1998) (where state provides post-termination\n\n\n\n                             -3-\n\fremedy, one who fails to take advantage of that remedy is\n\nbarred from pursuing a federal due process claim).\n\n            Burrell’s first amendment claim fails because the\n\nConstitution does not protect the speech of public employees\n\nregarding internal office matters.               Connick v. Myers, 461\n\nU.S.     138,   147   (1983).        Though     Burrell        contends     his\n\ntermination     was   due   to   complaints      about    alleged      racial\n\ndiscrimination -- speech which inherently addresses a matter\n\nof public concern, id. at 148 n. 8 -- we have reviewed in\n\ndetail    Burrell’s       factual    allegations,        and     we   see    no\n\nallegation       that       he      complained        regarding        racial\n\ndiscrimination prior to his termination.                 The remainder of\n\nhis federal claims are without merit, for the reasons stated\n\nin the magistrate judge’s Report and Recommendation; and the\n\ncourt did not err in refusing to exercise supplemental\n\njurisdiction over the state law claims.                  Pejepscot Indus.\n\nPark, Inc. v. Maine Ctrl. R.R. Co., 215 F.3d 195, 200 (1 st\n\nCir. 2000).\n\n            “Perhaps the government employer’s dismissal of the\n\nworker    may   not   be    fair,    but    ordinary     dismissals         from\n\ngovernment      service     which    violate     no    fixed      tenure     or\n\napplicable statute or regulation are not subject to judicial\n\nreview even if the reasons for the dismissal are alleged to\n\nbe mistaken or unreasonable.”              Connick, 461 U.S. at 146.\n\n                                     -4-\n\fAffirmed.   1st Cir.
