Noah insists,\r\n\nin  a mien  reminiscent of  the legendary  Perry Mason,  that the\r\n\nevidence produced at his trial actually  establishes the guilt of\r\n\na third person.1   In addition, he maintains that the trial judge\r\n\ncommitted  reversible  error  by  denying  a  motion  in  limine,\r\n\nrefusing  to allow  him  to  act as  his  own lawyer,  exhibiting\r\n\nimpermissible  bias,  and  imposing  an  overly  harsh  sentence.\r\n\nConcluding, as we do, that none of these arguments hold water, we\r\n\naffirm.\r\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          We  present the  pertinent  facts  in  the  light  most\r\n\nfavorable  to the jury  verdict, consistent with  record support.\r\n\nSee United  States v.  Rivera-Gomez, 67 F.3d  993, 995  (1st Cir.\r                                             \r\n\n1995); United States v. Maraj, 947 F.2d 520, 522 (1st Cir. 1991).\r                                       \r\n\n          In  1991, Noah,  a  citizen  of  Liberia,  launched  an\r\n\nenterprise  called Easy Electronic Tax Service (EETS) in Chicago,\r\n\nIllinois.   The business held  itself out as  able to prepare tax\r\n\nreturns,  file  them  electronically with  the  IRS,  and arrange\r\n\nrefund anticipation loans through a participating bank.   At this\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Mason  is,  of  course,  Erle  Stanley  Gardner's fictional\r\nlawyer-hero, idealized in  a television series bearing  his name,\r\nwho  possessed an  uncanny aptitude  for  exonerating clients  by\r\ncasting  blame elsewhere.  See generally David McCord, \"But Perry\r                                                                           \r\nMason  Made It  Look So  Easy!\":   The Admissibility  Of Evidence\r                                                                           \r\nOffered By A  Criminal Defendant To Suggest That  Someone Else Is\r                                                                           \r\nGuilty, 63 Tenn. L. Rev. 917 (1996).\r                \r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\npoint  (and,  indeed,  at  all  times  relevant  to  this  case),\r\n\ntaxpayers who wished  to file their returns  electronically could\r\n\ndo so only through an  approved electronic return originator.  To\r\n\nsecure  such  approbation,  a  tax preparer  had  to  complete an\r\n\napplication  form, undergo a  suitability review, and demonstrate\r\n\nthat  it  possessed the  requisite hardware  and software.   EETS\r\n\nfiled such  an application and  the IRS approved it,  thus paving\r\n\nthe way for  the company to participate in  the electronic filing\r\n\nprogram.\r\n\n          In  1993,  the  appellant  opened  an  EETS  office  in\r\n\nProvidence, Rhode Island, and hired several friends to  staff the\r\n\noperation.  These fledgling employees had duties that ranged from\r\n\nanswering the telephone to compiling client files to photocopying\r\n\nidentification cards and W-2 forms.  None of the recruits had any\r\n\nrelevant  professional  experience  in preparing  tax  returns or\r\n\nperfecting electronic  filings.2 Hence,  the appellant  alone was\r\n\nresponsible for preparing clients'  tax returns, transmitting the\r\n\nforms electronically, and arranging loans.\r\n\n          In  due season,  a  tax-fraud  scheme  blossomed.    In\r\n\naddition  to its  customary,  client-initiated tax  filings, EETS\r\n\nfrom time to  time submitted tax returns that bore  the names and\r\n\nsocial   security  numbers  of  actual  people,  but  which  were\r\n\nembellished  by concocted data  (e.g., fictitious or  altered W-2\r\n\nforms, non-existent  dependents).   Based on  these commentitious\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2Indeed,  in lieu of paying wages, the appellant compensated\r\nmany of these  neophytes by offering to teach them how to prepare\r\nand file tax returns via the computer.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nreturns,  EETS secured refund  anticipation loans payable  to the\r\n\n\"taxpayers.\"  The appellant then asked various EETS  employees to\r\n\nconvert  the checks representing the  loan proceeds into cash and\r\n\ngive the realized funds to him, mendaciously  telling his minions\r\n\nthat  he already  had given  the  named beneficiaries  equivalent\r\n\namounts from EETS's  operational accounts.  In  another iteration\r\n\nof the fraud, EETS  from time to time  would alter real  clients'\r\n\nearnings statements,  or increase  the number  of dependents,  or\r\n\nboth, in  order to  obtain loans  based on  larger-than-warranted\r\n\nrefunds.   In  these instances,  the appellant  would pocket  the\r\n\nexcess proceeds.   Either way,  the participating  bank would  be\r\n\nmade whole by  means of the fraudulently secured  refunds and the\r\n\nIRS would be left holding an empty bag.\r\n\n          The   scheme  proved  to   be  pervasive:     after  an\r\n\ninvestigation,  the  IRS   identified  EETS  as  the   source  of\r\n\napproximately  100  electronic  returns, 60  of  which  contained\r\n\napocryphal items.  Eighteen of those were entirely bogus.  All of\r\n\nthe latter, including the returns that corresponded to the counts\r\n\nof  conviction,  involved  individuals  known  personally to  the\r\n\nappellant.  For example, EETS prepared a false W-2 form and filed\r\n\na fraudulent tax  return in the name of Fred  Gayetay.  Gayetay's\r\n\nfather,  Shedrick Gayetay, was  an EETS  employee hired  by Noah.\r\n\nSimilarly,  EETS  prepared  fraudulent W-2  forms  and  other tax\r\n\ndocuments in the  names of Prince and Varwoi Jordan.   The Jordan\r\n\nsiblings  were  high  school  students  whose  mother,  Elizabeth\r\n\nPowell, was a friend of Noah's and also dated Shedrick Gayetay.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\n          On July 10, 1996, a  federal grand jury in the District\r\n\nof Rhode Island indicted the appellant on six counts of knowingly\r\n\nmaking and presenting false, fictitious, and fraudulent claims to\r\n\nthe  IRS in violation  of 18 U.S.C.    287 (1994).   Following an\r\n\neight-day trial, the jury  found the appellant guilty across  the\r\n\nboard.  Judge Lagueux  sentenced him to a  33-month incarcerative\r\n\nterm.  This appeal ensued.\r\n\nII.  ANALYSIS\r          II.  ANALYSIS\r\n\n          Noah's appellate counsel  advances five assignments  of\r\n\nerror.  We address them in  the sequence indicated in the initial\r\n\nparagraph of this opinion.\r\n\n                 A.  Sufficiency of the Evidence.\r                           A.  Sufficiency of the Evidence.\r                                                          \r\n\n          An appellate court  plays a very circumscribed  role in\r\n\ngauging  the sufficiency of the evidentiary foundation upon which\r\n\na criminal conviction rests.  The court of appeals neither weighs\r\n\nthe credibility of  the witnesses nor attempts to  assess whether\r\n\nthe prosecution  succeeded in  eliminating every  possible theory\r\n\nconsistent with the defendant's innocence.  See United States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nEcheverri, 982 F.2d 675, 677 (1st Cir. 1993).   Instead, its task\r                   \r\n\nis to  canvass the evidence  (direct and  circumstantial) in  the\r\n\nlight  most agreeable to the  prosecution and decide whether that\r\n\nevidence,   including   all  plausible   inferences   extractable\r\n\ntherefrom, enables  a rational  factfinder to  conclude beyond  a\r\n\nreasonable  doubt that the defendant committed the charged crime.\r\n\nSee United  States v.  Saccoccia, 58 F.3d  754, 773-74  (1st Cir.\r                                          \r\n\n1995), cert. denied, 116 S. Ct.  1322 (1996); Maraj, 947 F.2d  at\r                                                             \r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\n522-23.\r\n\n          The evidence in  this case passes the  sufficiency test\r\n\nwith flying colors.  A rational jury easily could have found that\r\n\nNoah was the person at EETS who prepared clients' tax returns and\r\n\nfiled refund  claims electronically.   Given the ubiquity  of the\r\n\nspurious data, it would have been  reasonable, from this evidence\r\n\nalone,  to  infer  that  the  appellant  knowingly  prepared  and\r\n\nsubmitted  the fabricated  claims.    Here,  however,  there  was\r\n\nconsiderably  more.   The  evidence  also  established  that  the\r\n\nappellant knew personally  all the individuals whose  tax records\r\n\nwere  falsified; that he had access  to the information necessary\r\n\nto  complete the  fraudulent forms;  that he  processed  the loan\r\n\napplications;  that  he  directed  the  conversion  of  the  loan\r\n\nproceeds into cash; and that he  received the money.  We have  no\r\n\ndoubt but that these facts suffice to ground the verdict.\r\n\n          The  appellant seeks to weaken this chain of inferences\r\n\nby offering us a new target.  We should overturn his  conviction,\r\n\nhe says,  because the  evidence,  even if  legally sufficient  to\r\n\nsupport the jury's verdict, points  more directly to the guilt of\r\n\nShedrick  Gayetay.    This  importuning  misperceives  the proper\r\n\noffice of appellate review.\r\n\n          The mere fact that the  evidence in a case, viewed from\r\n\nthe  defendant's coign of vantage, points convincingly to another\r\n\nperson as the guilty party does  not prevent a conviction.  After\r\n\nall,  it is  for  the  jury  to mull  the  evidence,  assess  the\r\n\ncredibility of the witnesses, and draw such reasonable inferences\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nas it may choose. Once the jury performs that task and  authors a\r\n\nverdict, judicial  review thereafter must concentrate  on whether\r\n\nthe  jury's interpretation  is  sustainable  under the  governing\r\n\nlegal standards.  See United States  v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707,  711\r                                                       \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1992) (explaining that  a guilty verdict will be upheld\r\n\nas  long as  it \"is  supported  by a  plausible rendition  of the\r\n\nrecord\").   Whether  the jury  plausibly  could have  pointed the\r\n\nfinger of  blame at someone  else is not  the question.   In this\r\n\ninstance, the  conclusion that the jury reached  is reasonable in\r\n\nlight  of  the  evidence  presented  at trial  and  there  is  no\r\n\nprincipled basis  for overturning the  verdict on  the ground  of\r\n\nevidentiary insufficiency.\r\n\n                      B.  Motion in Limine.\r                                B.  Motion in Limine.\r                                                    \r\n\n          Some  weeks  prior  to trial,  the  appellant  moved in\r\n\nlimine to exclude evidence of  bogus tax filings apart from those\r\n\ndescribed in the indictment's six counts.  On the brink of trial,\r\n\nthe district court heard argument on the motion.  Defense counsel\r\n\nclaimed that the introduction of the challenged evidence would be\r\n\n\"cumulative\" and \"highly prejudicial,\" and would consume too much\r\n\npreparation time.  Citing Fed.  R. Evid. 404(b), the court denied\r\n\nthe motion as premature in  the absence of a specific evidentiary\r\n\ncontext.   During  trial, the  government  offered only  a  small\r\n\nquantity of the challenged evidence, which with one exception was\r\n\nreceived absent any objection.\r\n\n          In  this venue, the appellant's new lawyer puts a fresh\r\n\nspin on the motion in limine.   He asseverates that the  district\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\ncourt  should have  treated  it  as  a  request  for  a  bill  of\r\n\nparticulars and granted it on this basis.  We are not persuaded.\r\n\n          In the court below, the appellant filed a document that\r\n\nhe characterized  as  a motion  in  limine and,  consistent  with\r\n\ncounsel's assertion that the admission of the challenged evidence\r\n\nwould  be cumulative and highly prejudicial, the court reasonably\r\n\nunderstood the motion as one implicating Rule 404(b).  Although a\r\n\ntrial court may not rely woodenly on a  motion's label and ignore\r\n\nits purport, this motion bore scant similarity to a  prototypical\r\n\nmotion  for bill  of  particulars, see,  e.g.,  United States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nPaiva, 892 F.2d 148, 154  (1st Cir. 1989) (describing the purpose\r               \r\n\nof such a bill), and the district court's decision to treat it as\r\n\nwhat  it  proclaimed  itself  to  be    a  motion  to  limit  the\r\n\nintroduction  of proof  of other,  related  bad acts  at trial   \r\n\ncannot be faulted.\r\n\n          That said, we  discern no error in the  court's refusal\r\n\nto grant the motion in limine.  Rule 404(b), which authorizes the\r\n\nadmission   of  evidence  of  \"other  crimes,  wrongs,  or  acts\"\r\n\ncommitted by the defendant for purposes such as \"proof of motive,\r\n\nopportunity, intent,  preparation, plan, knowledge,  identity, or\r\n\nabsence of mistake  or accident,\" always must be  read in concert\r\n\nwith Rule 403, which provides  for a balancing of probative value\r\n\nagainst  unfairly prejudicial effect.   So read,  the combination\r\n\npermits the trial  court to exclude \"other bad  acts\" evidence on\r\n\nthe  ground, inter  alia,  that  it is  likely  to cause  \"unfair\r\n\nprejudice\" or  \"confusion [of] the  issues,\" or that  it probably\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nwill  lead  to  \"needless presentation  of  cumulative evidence.\"\r\n\nFed. R. Evid. 403.\r\n\n          In  this instance, the district court denied the motion\r\n\nin limine without prejudice to later objection  because the court\r\n\ncould  not determine satisfactorily  in advance of  trial whether\r\n\nthe  unfairly  prejudicial effects  (if any)  of the  evidence of\r\n\nother  fraudulent  tax   filings  substantially  outweighed  that\r\n\nevidence's  probative   worth.    This  wait-and-see  stance  was\r\n\nreasonable  under  the  circumstances.

A court is\r                           \r\n\nnot required to  make judgment calls about admissibility a priori\r                                                                           \r\n\nand out of context, and  we reject the appellant's assertion that\r\n\nthe court below abused its discretion in refusing to do so.3\r\n\n          Nor can the  appellant be heard  to complain about  the\r\n\nlower  court's admission of  \"other bad acts\"  evidence at trial.\r\n\nDuring  its case  in chief,  the  government introduced  evidence\r\n\nanent two  fraudulent filings not specifically alluded  to in the\r\n\nindictment, neither of which prompted a Rule 404(b) objection. \r\n\nConsequently, there is  no occasion for us to  comment upon them.\r\n\nIt  is settled  in this  circuit  that, when  the district  court\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3The objection on the ground of \"too much preparation  time\"\r\nis  not  persuasive.   There  were  only  eighteen  totally bogus\r\nreturns  and, if  more  preparation  time  were  needed,  defense\r\ncounsel could  have sought a  continuance (which he did  not do).\r\nMoreover, the motion sought to  exclude all such evidence, not to\r                                                 \r\nrequire the government to specify which returns it would offer in\r\nevidence.  And in  all events, given the minute  quantity of such\r\nevidence actually offered by the government, see infra, any error\r                                                                \r\nwould have been harmless.\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\ntentatively denies a pretrial motion  in limine, or temporizes on\r\n\nit,  the   party  objecting  to   the    preliminary   in  limine\r\n\ndetermination must renew  his objection during the trial, and the\r\n\nfailure to do so forfeits any  objection.  See Griffin, 818  F.2d\r                                                                \r\n\nat 105 (holding  that to raise and preserve for review a claim of\r\n\nimproperly  constructing the Rule 403 balance, a party ordinarily\r\n\ncannot rely  on the denial of a motion  in limine but must object\r\n\nto  the admission  of the  controversial evidence  in the  actual\r\n\ntrial setting); see also United States v. Holmquist, 36 F.2d 154,\r                                                             \r\n\n166 (1st  Cir. 1994) (concluding  that when a pretrial  motion in\r\n\nlimine is  granted and the  court \"clearly invites  the adversely\r\n\naffected party to  offer the evidence at sidebar  for the purpose\r\n\nof reassessing the  scope and effect of the order  in the setting\r\n\nof the actual  trial, the exclusion of evidence  pursuant to that\r\n\norder   may   be  challenged   on  appeal   only  if   the  party\r\n\nunsuccessfully attempts to offer such evidence in accordance with\r\n\nthe terms specified in the order\").\r\n\n          The only  other use of such evidence  occurred when the\r\n\nappellant took  the  stand as  part  of the  defense case.    The\r\n\nprosecutor   cross-examined  him  about  one  of  the  first  two\r\n\nincidents,  again without objection, and also introduced evidence\r\n\nof a third fraudulent filing not specified in the indictment.  We\r\n\nmust reach the Rule 404(b)  issue in connection with that return,\r\n\ninasmuch  as the  appellant preserved  his rights  by means  of a\r\n\ncontemporaneous  Rule 404(b) objection.   Doing so,  we hold that\r\n\nthe  admission of  that evidence    which  involved a  fraudulent\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nreturn compiled in the name of Dahn (an acquaintance of Noah's)  \r\n\nwas proper.\r\n\n          The  appellant staked  his defense  on the  proposition\r\n\nthat he was  an innocent dupe, victimized by  a lawless employee.\r\n\nAs  the district  court  found, the  spurious  return was  highly\r\n\nrelevant  to show the appellant's guilty knowledge, the existence\r\n\nof a criminal plan, and the absence of mistake, and its probative\r\n\nvalue  outweighed any unfairly  prejudicial effects.   Since this\r\n\nfinding derives adequate support from the record, the trial court\r\n\ndid not abuse  its discretion in permitting the  jury to consider\r\n\nthe evidence.   See, e.g., United States v.  Frankhauser, 80 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n\n641,  648 (1st Cir. 1996);  United States v.

His  claim  is\r\n\nstraightforward.   He  tells us that  he repeatedly  attempted to\r\n\nassert his right to act as his own lawyer, and that  the district\r\n\ncourt (erroneously, in his view) refused his request.\r\n\n          1.   What  The Record  Reveals.   On the  first day  of\r                    1.   What  The Record  Reveals.\r                                                  \r\n\ntrial, after  the  jury had  been  empaneled but  before  opening\r\n\nstatements,  the court denied  the appellant's motion  in limine.\r\n\nThe following exchange then took place:\r\n\n          DEFENSE COUNSEL:   Excuse me, your Honor.   I\r                    DEFENSE COUNSEL:\r                                   \r\n          realize that this is  highly unusual, but  my\r\n          client  wants to express  a desire to address\r\n          the Court.\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\n          THE COURT: No.  That's not appropriate.\r                    THE COURT:\r                             \r\n\n          DEFENDANT:  I don't want to address the Court\r                    DEFENDANT:\r                             \r\n          on issues between my counsel.  I request your\r\n          Honor  \r\n\n          THE COURT:  You be  quiet.  You have a lawyer\r                    THE COURT:\r                             \r\n          who speaks  for you  and that's  enough.   Be\r\n          seated,  please, while  I  proceed with  this\r\n          trial.\r\n\nThe record is silent with  regard to the intended subject  of the\r\n\ncensored statement.\r\n\n          On the  third day  of trial,  the appellant  personally\r\n\npresented a motion to proceed pro se.  The court heard the motion\r\n\nout of the jury's earshot.  The appellant expressed the view that\r\n\nby refusing to  offer certain motions and evidence  his appointed\r\n\nattorney \"caused me a lot of setback\" and \"have not assisted me.\"\r\n\nJudge Lagueux pointed  out the dangers  inherent in the  request,\r\n\nnoting  the appellant's  apparent lack  of  understanding of  the\r\n\nrules of evidence and predicting  that, by proceeding pro se, the\r\n\nappellant would be \"putting himself in prison.\"\r\n\n          On  the next day,  the dialogue  resumed.   After again\r\n\nquestioning the  appellant's ability to represent himself without\r\n\nimperilling  his  case,  the court  finally  denied  the request,\r\n\ndeclaring that to allow it  would cause \"a complete disruption of\r\n\nthe proceedings.\"  The court then stated in relevant part:\r\n\n          THE COURT:   I'm satisfied that to  allow you\r                    THE COURT:\r                             \r\n          to  defend yourself in  this case would  be a\r\n          disruption, since we  are almost through with\r\n          the Government's case.   And to allow  you to\r\n          come  in  now and  discharge  your lawyer  in\r\n          midstream would be totally destructive of the\r\n          orderly  process of .  . . criminal  law, the\r\n          trial of cases. . . .\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\n                         *      *      *\r\n\n          Your motion is denied because the  disruption\r\n          of  the proceedings  outweighs your  right to\r\n          represent yourself.  If  this matter had come\r\n          up before trial, then I could have dealt with\r\n          it.   I could  have allowed you  to represent\r\n          yourself and have standby counsel.\r\n\n          DEFENDANT:   I didn't know that until we were\r                    DEFENDANT:\r                             \r\n          into the trial  \r\n\n          THE  COURT:   But  now  that  the  trial  has\r                    THE  COURT:\r                              \r\n          started, it's too disruptive.\r\n\n          DEFENDANT:   I didn't know that until we were\r                    DEFENDANT:\r                             \r\n          into  the trial  before I  found  out what  I\r\n          found out.   Had I known before, I would have\r\n          made this motion before the trial begins.\r\n\n          THE COURT:  Well, it's too late.\r                    THE COURT:\r                             \r\n\n          The  appellant made one final  allusion to the issue of\r\n\nself-representation on the afternoon of  the fifth day of  trial.\r\n\nSince he neither  mentions this incident in his  brief nor relies\r\n\nupon it  as comprising  part of  the assigned  error,  we do  not\r\n\naddress it.\r\n\n          2.

At that  point, the  presiding  judge, in  his\r\n\ndiscretion,  may deny  a defendant's  request to  act as  his own\r\n\nlawyer.  See Robards v. Rees, 789  F.2d 379, 384 (6th Cir. 1986);\r                                      \r\n\nUnited States v. Dunlap, 577 F.2d 867, 868 (4th Cir. 1978).\r                                 \r\n\n          The  record  in  this  case fails  to  show  that  Noah\r\n\nexpressed   a  desire  to  represent  himself  before  his  trial\r\n\ncommenced.   Although  his appellate  counsel  maintains that  we\r\n\nshould infer  an intention to  make such  a desire  known to  the\r\n\ncourt from  the appellant's  aborted effort to  speak on  his own\r\n\nbehalf  after  the  jury  had been  selected  but  before opening\r\n\narguments, he points  to nothing in the record   say, an offer of\r\n\nproof   that would support such an  inference.  What is more, any\r\n\nsuch inference is  belied by Noah's own statement,  on the fourth\r\n\nday of trial, that  he \"didn't know . . . until  we were into the\r\n\ntrial\"  that the  court would have  allowed him,  upon seasonable\r\n\nrequest, to represent  himself.  Indeed, Noah  declared, \"[h]ad I\r\n\nknown  before, I  would have  made this  motion before  the trial\r                                                                           \r\n\nbegins.\" (emphasis supplied).\r                \r\n\n          A  defendant's  request  to represent  himself  must be\r\n\ncommunicated to  the court clearly and unambiguously.  See United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Bennett,  539 F.2d 45, 50  (10th Cir. 1976).   Here, no\r                           \r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\nsuch   communication   took   place   in   advance   of   trial.4\r\n\nConsequently, the  appellant has no  valid claim  to an  absolute\r\n\nSixth Amendment right to self-representation.\r\n\n          This  conclusion      that  the  appellant  sought   to\r\n\nrepresent  himself only  after his  trial had commenced    leaves\r\n\nunresolved the propriety of  the lower court's refusal  to permit\r\n\nhim  to do so  when he made  such a request  during the third and\r\n\nfourth days of trial.  We turn now to that question.\r\n\n          A district  court has considerable discretion  to grant\r\n\nor deny a  request for self-representation that  is not presented\r\n\nuntil trial  is under way.   See United States  v. Singleton, 107\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.3d 1091, 1096  (4th Cir.)

It is\r\n\nimproper for  the court to deny the  defendant the right to serve\r\n\nas his own attorney solely because  of a perceived lack of  legal\r\n\ndexterity, see Faretta, 422 U.S. at 835, education, see Johnstone\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.

Bartlett,  44 F.3d 95,  99 n.1  (2d Cir.\r                                           \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4As  mentioned above,  the  appellant's initial  attempt  to\r\naddress the court  occurred after  the jury  had been  empaneled.\r\nInasmuch  as the ensuing exchange cannot  reasonably be viewed as\r\nan assertion of the right to proceed pro se, we need  not resolve\r\nthe question of  whether the invocation of that  right after jury\r\nselection  should  be  deemed  the  functional  equivalent  of  a\r\npretrial assertion.\r                  \r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\n1994).\r\n\n          The  record suggests that we should treat what occurred\r\n\non the third  and fourth  trial days  as two halves  of a  single\r\n\nentreaty and we  accept the suggestion.  In  addressing that two-\r\n\nday  colloquy, the appellant points to Judge Lagueux's references\r\n\nto  his lack  of  training  and his  likely  inability to  master\r\n\nrelevant legal concepts  as evidence of discretion run  amok.  We\r\n\nthink that this line of argument reads too  much into too little.\r\n\nWhile the judge did voice such concerns, the transcript persuades\r\n\nus that the  decisive factor in his analysis was  the effect that\r\n\ngranting the  motion would have  had on the  ongoing trial.   The\r\n\njudge commented  more than  once that  the government's case  was\r\n\nalmost complete and that \"to allow [the defendant] to come in now\r\n\nand   discharge  [his]  lawyer  in  midstream  would  be  totally\r\n\ndestructive of the orderly process of .  . . criminal law.\"  When\r\n\nall was said and  done, Judge Lagueux premised the denial  of the\r\n\nappellant's   motion  squarely   on  the   fact   that,  in   the\r\n\ncircumstances at hand,  the likely disruption of  the proceedings\r\n\nmilitated against indulging the right of self-representation.\r\n\n          The reasonableness of this conclusion is scarcely  open\r\n\nto  question.  District courts  have an institutional interest in\r\n\navoiding  the  disruption  of  trial proceedings.    To  permit a\r\n\ndefendant to switch roles near the halfway point of a complicated\r\n\ncriminal  trial  runs an  obvious  risk of  dislocating  both the\r\n\ncourt's docket  and the orderly  progression of the trial.   See,\r                                                                          \r\n\ne.g., Robards, 789 F.2d at 384.  Then, too, such an abrupt about-\r                       \r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\nface would  have tended to  prejudice the prosecution  (which had\r\n\nput  in   most of  its case  without knowing  that the  appellant\r\n\nsought  to  appear  as  both  lawyer and  party).    Given  these\r\n\nconsiderations,  and  bearing   in  mind  the  district   court's\r\n\nentitlement to attach weight  to the presence of competent  trial\r\n\ncounsel, see, e.g., Williams, 44 F.3d at 99 n.1 (stating that the\r                                      \r\n\nquality  of counsel is among the criteria  to be used in deciding\r\n\nwhether to permit self-representation once a trial has begun), we\r\n\ndo not believe that any abuse of discretion occurred.\r\n\n                           D.  Recusal.\r                                     D.  Recusal.\r                                                \r\n\n          Next, the appellant suggests that  Judge Lagueux should\r\n\nhave  recused himself  as biased  in respect  to  the appellant's\r\n\nrace, ethnicity, and homeland.  This is a serious accusation, and\r\n\nwe  treat  it  as  such.    Bias  of  any  kind, especially  bias\r\n\npredicated on traits such as race, ethnicity, or national origin,\r\n\nis antithetic to the fundamental  values upon which our system of\r\n\njustice  rests.   Consequently, appellate  courts must  zealously\r\n\nguard not only against the actuality of judicial bias but against\r\n\nany appearance of it.\r\n\n          Here,  however,  the  appellant's  charge  is   plainly\r\n\nunfounded.   It rests wholly on  an isolated comment made  by the\r\n\njudge to  the appellant,  a Liberian national,  in the  course of\r\n\ndenying the  mid-trial request to proceed pro se.  In an apparent\r\n\neffort  to cushion  the  blow  (that is,  to  help the  appellant\r\n\nunderstand  that he  would receive  a fair  trial even  though he\r\n\nwould not be allowed to act  as his own attorney), Judge  Lagueux\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\ncommented:   \"This is the United States of America.  You're given\r\n\nmore rights here than you ever had in Liberia, I'm sure of that.\"\r\n\nAlthough the judge's choice of phrase may have been infelicitous,\r\n\nthe comment,  when viewed in  context, is entirely devoid  of any\r\n\ntrace of animus.5 \r\n\n          We  add,  moreover,  that  the  record  indicates quite\r\n\nvividly  that  Judge Lagueux  conducted  himself throughout  this\r\n\neight-day  trial  in  a fair,  balanced,  and  wholly appropriate\r\n\nmanner.  Under these circumstances, the assignment of error lacks\r\n\nmerit.\r\n\n                E.  The Special Skill Enhancement.\r                          E.  The Special Skill Enhancement.\r                                                           \r\n\n          The  appellant's  final  objection  concerns the  lower\r\n\ncourt's  decision to increase  his offense level  (and, thus, his\r\n\nsentence)  because he  \"used a  special skill,  in a  manner that\r\n\nsignificantly facilitated  the commission  or concealment of  the\r\n\noffense.\"     USSG   3B1.3  (Nov.  1995).    Clearly,  the  court\r\n\nsupportably could have found that the appellant employed whatever\r\n\nskill he may have  had to facilitate the fraud.   Thus, the issue\r\n\nreduces to  whether the  record sustains a  finding that  the sum\r\n\ntotal  of the  faculties  that the  appellant  used in  preparing\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5We  note  that  the  appellant  lodged  no  contemporaneous\r\nobjection  to this remark  (say, by  seeking the  judge's recusal\r\nthen and there or by moving for  a mistrial).  In all likelihood,\r\nthen,  the  argument   that  he  now  advances   is  procedurally\r\ndefaulted.  See United  States v. Kimball, 73 F.3d 269, 273 (10th\r                                                   \r\nCir. 1995)  (reiterating that  \"the party seeking  recusal .  . .\r\nmust do so in a timely fashion\"); United States v. Brinkworth, 68\r                                                                       \r\nF.3d 633,  639 (2d  Cir. 1995) (holding  that a  disqualification\r\nmotion  must be  sought \"at  the earliest  possible  moment after\r\nobtaining knowledge of  facts demonstrating the basis  for such a\r\nclaim\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n\n                                18\r\r\n\ncrooked  tax returns and filing them electronically constituted a\r\n\n\"special  skill\"  within  the  meaning  of  section  3B1.3.   The\r\n\nappellant answers  this question  in the  negative; he  maintains\r\n\nthat filing  tax returns  electronically is  an abecedarian  task\r\n\nthat anyone can perform.   The government answers the question in\r\n\nthe affirmative; it maintains  that the appellant had  acquired a\r\n\nskill  set  not enjoyed  by  the  public  at large,  namely,  the\r\n\ncombination of talents necessary to  prepare and file tax returns\r\n\nelectronically.\r\n\n          The  district court  shared the  government's view  and\r\n\nboosted the offense  level by two notches in  reliance on section\r\n\n3B1.3.   Our  review of  this  determination is  bifurcated:   we\r\n\nconsider the meaning of the term \"special skill\" de novo and then\r\n\nscrutinize the district  court's application of the  guideline to\r\n\nthe  discerned facts  for  clear  error.   See  United States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nConnell, 960 F.2d 191, 197-98 (1st Cir. 1992).\r                 \r\n\n          The Sentencing Commission's  application notes disclose\r\n\nthat the term  \"[s]pecial skill\" refers to a  skill not possessed\r\n\nby   members  of  the   general  public  and   usually  requiring\r\n\nsubstantial  education, training  or  licensing.\"   USSG   3B1.3,\r\n\ncomment.  (n.2).   The  note  enumerates as  examples  of persons\r\n\npossessing special skills \"pilots, lawyers, doctors, accountants,\r\n\nchemists, and  demolition experts.\"   Id.    The appellant  leans\r                                                   \r\n\nheavily on  this language,  emphasizing his  comparative lack  of\r\n\neducation and the fact that he was not licensed as an accountant.\r\n\nBut the text  will not bear the  weight that the  appellant loads\r\n\n                                19\r\r\n\nupon  it.  The  use of the  term \"usually\" in  application note 2\r\n\nsignifies often, but not always.  Hence, neither formal education\r\n\nnor professional stature is a necessary concomitant for a special\r\n\nskill adjustment.   See United States v. Spencer, 4 F.3d 115, 120\r                                                          \r\n\n(2d Cir. 1993); United  States v. Hummer, 916 F.2d 186,  191 (4th\r                                                  \r\n\nCir. 1990).  To the contrary, a special skill can be derived from\r\n\nexperience  or from self-tutelage.   See, e.g.,  United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nGandy, 36 F.3d 912, 914 (10th Cir. 1994); United States v. Lavin,\r                                                                          \r\n\n27 F.3d 40, 41 (2d Cir. 1994).\r\n\n          The  appellant has  a fallback  position.   He  insists\r\n\nthat,  because tax  preparation  and  the  electronic  filing  of\r\n\nreturns  are  relatively  simple  undertakings,  the  ability  to\r\n\naccomplish these  duties cannot  be considered  a special  skill.\r\n\nEven if this  self-serving appraisal is accurate    a matter that\r\n\nwe think is open to debate    nothing in the guidelines  suggests\r\n\nthat the  specialness of  the faculty necessarily  hinges on  the\r\n\ncomplexity  of the task  to be performed.   See United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nLewis, 41 F.3d 1209,  1214 (7th Cir. 1994)  (noting that even  if\r               \r\n\n\"an average  person can accomplish  a task at which  someone with\r\n\nspecial  training or skill is adept,\" that fact alone \"does not .\r\n\n.  .  convert  the  activity  in question  into  an  ordinary  or\r\n\nunspecialized activity\").  Thus, consistent with our  view of the\r\n\nlanguage and purpose of section  3B1.3, we hold that a  skill can\r\n\nbe special even though the activity to which the skill is applied\r\n\nis  mundane.   The  key  is  whether  the defendant's  skill  set\r\n\nelevates  him  to  a  level of  knowledge  and  proficiency  that\r\n\n                                20\r\r\n\neclipses that possessed by the general public.  See, e.g., United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Peterson, 98 F.3d  502, 506-507 (9th Cir. 1996); United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Malgoza, 2 F.3d 1107, 1110-11 (11th Cir. 1993).\r                           \r\n\n          Against  this backdrop,  the  district court's  finding\r\n\nthat  the appellant  exercised  a  cognizable  special  skill  in\r\n\ncommitting  the offenses  of  conviction  is  supportable.    The\r\n\nappellant  was  a  professional  tax  preparer  who,  though  not\r\n\nspecially educated,  was paid fees  to process tax  returns, file\r\n\nthem electronically, and arrange refund anticipation loans.  In a\r\n\ncase  not  unlike this  one,  the  Second  Circuit held  that  an\r\n\naccountant who prepared and filed false tax returns and W-2 forms\r\n\nfor his infant  children possessed a special skill that increased\r\n\nhis chance  of succeeding on  the fraudulent refund claims.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited States v.  Fritzson, 979 F.2d 21,  22 (2d Cir. 1992).   We\r                                    \r\n\nfind this holding persuasive, and we  see no reason why the  fact\r\n\nthat the tax-return preparer is a self-taught practitioner rather\r\n\nthan  a formally  trained accountant  should  make a  dispositive\r\n\ndifference.  Regardless of matters like licensure and degree, the\r\n\nappellant had  to \"know and  comprehend the extent of  the duties\r\n\nand  obligations imposed by the  tax laws.\"   Id. at 22 (citation\r                                                           \r\n\nand  internal quotation marks omitted).   And, moreover, we agree\r\n\nthat  a professional tax preparer's \"knowledge of the withholding\r\n\nprocess,  including  the  roles  of  the  claim  and  transmittal\r\n\ndocuments, and how  and when to file them,  exceeds the knowledge\r\n\nof  the  average person,\"  id.,  and  justifies  a special  skill\r                                        \r\n\nenhancement  in this  case.    Indeed, to  be  successful in  the\r\n\n                                21\r\r\n\nparticular  corner of  the  tax trade  that  he occupied,  Noah's\r\n\nspecialized knowledge had to extend into the realm of cyberspace.\r\n\n            Two  other  facts render  this  conclusion especially\r\n\nappropriate in this case and thus reinforce  the district court's\r\n\ndetermination.  First, at  all relevant times the IRS  authorized\r\n\nonly certain individuals   approved electronic return originators\r\n\n   to submit tax returns by computer.   Inasmuch as the appellant\r\n\nhad  secured such  approval (albeit  in  the name  of EETS),  the\r\n\nsentencing  court  readily   could  find  that  he   possessed  a\r\n\ncapability which was special in the sense that it was not enjoyed\r\n\nby  the populace at large.   Second, the record reflects that the\r\n\nappellant procured the  services of others  by offering to  teach\r\n\nthem the  techniques necessary to  perfect electronic  tax-return\r\n\nfilings.   See  supra  note  2.   This  circumstance supports  an\r                               \r\n\ninference that  the skill  set which the  appellant amassed   was\r\n\nneither widely known nor easily mastered, and thus buttresses the\r\n\nsentencing court's finding.\r\n\n          We need go  no further.6   The short of  it is that  we\r\n\ndiscern no error  in the district court's conclusion  that a two-\r\n\nlevel upward  adjustment was warranted.   The record  allowed the\r\n\ncourt to find that the appellant had  a special skill and used it\r\n\nto perpetrate the  offenses of conviction.  No  more is exigible.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6The  applicable   guideline  precludes   a  special   skill\r\nenhancement \"if . . . [the] skill is included in the base offense\r\nlevel or specific offense characteristic.\"  USSG  3B1.3; see also\r                                                                           \r\nConnell, 960 F.2d at 199  (describing operation of proviso).

Noah, a professional tax preparer, implores us to set aside his conviction on multiple counts of knowingly presenting fraudulent tax returns to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  Noah insists, in a mien reminiscent of the legendary Perry Mason, that the evidence produced at his trial actually establishes the guilt of a third person.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In addition, he maintains that the trial judge committed reversible error by denying a motion in limine, refusing to allow him to act as his own lawyer, exhibiting impermissible bias, and imposing an overly harsh sentence.  Concluding, as we do, that none of these arguments hold water, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We present the pertinent facts in the light most favorable to the jury verdict, consistent with record support.  See United States v. Rivera-Gomez, 67 F.3d 993, 995 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v. Maraj, 947 F.2d 520, 522 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1991, Noah, a citizen of Liberia, launched an enterprise called Easy Electronic Tax Service (EETS) in Chicago, Illinois.  The business held itself out as able to prepare tax returns, file them electronically with the IRS, and arrange refund anticipation loans through a participating bank.  At this point (and, indeed, at all times relevant to this case), taxpayers who wished to file their returns electronically could do so only through an approved electronic return originator.  To secure such approbation, a tax preparer had to complete an application form, undergo a suitability review, and demonstrate that it possessed the requisite hardware and software.  EETS filed such an application and the IRS approved it, thus paving the way for the company to participate in the electronic filing program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1993, the appellant opened an EETS office in Providence, Rhode Island, and hired several friends to staff the operation.  These fledgling employees had duties that ranged from answering the telephone to compiling client files to photocopying identification cards and W-2 forms.  None of the recruits had any relevant professional experience in preparing tax returns or perfecting electronic filings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Hence, the appellant alone was responsible for preparing clients' tax returns, transmitting the forms electronically, and arranging loans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due season, a tax-fraud scheme blossomed.  In addition to its customary, client-initiated tax filings, EETS from time to time submitted tax returns that bore the names and social security numbers of actual people, but which were embellished by concocted data (e.g., fictitious or altered W-2 forms, non-existent dependents).  Based on these commentitious returns, EETS secured refund anticipation loans payable to the \"taxpayers.\"   The appellant then asked various EETS employees to convert the checks representing the loan proceeds into cash and give the realized funds to him, mendaciously telling his minions that he already had given the named beneficiaries equivalent amounts from EETS's operational accounts.  In another iteration of the fraud, EETS from time to time would alter real clients' earnings statements, or increase the number of dependents, or both, in order to obtain loans based on larger-than-warranted refunds.  In these instances, the appellant would pocket the excess proceeds.  Either way, the participating bank would be made whole by means of the fraudulently secured refunds and the IRS would be left holding an empty bag.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The scheme proved to be pervasive:  after an investigation, the IRS identified EETS as the source of approximately 100 electronic returns, 60 of which contained apocryphal items.  Eighteen of those were entirely bogus.  All of the latter, including the returns that corresponded to the counts of conviction, involved individuals known personally to the appellant.  For example, EETS prepared a false W-2 form and filed a fraudulent tax return in the name of Fred Gayetay.  Gayetay's father, Shedrick Gayetay, was an EETS employee hired by Noah.  Similarly, EETS prepared fraudulent W-2 forms and other tax documents in the names of Prince and Varwoi Jordan.  The Jordan siblings were high school students whose mother, Elizabeth Powell, was a friend of Noah's and also dated Shedrick Gayetay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 10, 1996, a federal grand jury in the District of Rhode Island indicted the appellant on six counts of knowingly making and presenting false, fictitious, and fraudulent claims to the IRS in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 287 (1994).  Following an eight-day trial, the jury found the appellant guilty across the board.  Judge Lagueux sentenced him to a 33-month incarcerative term.  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Noah's appellate counsel advances five assignments of error.  We address them in the sequence indicated in the initial paragraph of this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>A. Sufficiency of the Evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An appellate court plays a very circumscribed role in gauging the sufficiency of the evidentiary foundation upon which a criminal conviction rests.  The court of appeals neither weighs the credibility of the witnesses nor attempts to assess whether the prosecution succeeded in eliminating every possible theory consistent with the defendant's innocence.  See United States v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 677 (1st Cir.1993).  Instead, its task is to canvass the evidence (direct and circumstantial) in the light most agreeable to the prosecution and decide whether that evidence, including all plausible inferences extractable therefrom, enables a rational factfinder to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the charged crime.  See United States v. Saccoccia, 58 F.3d 754, 773-74 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1105, 116 S.Ct. 1322, 134 L.Ed.2d 474 (1996);  Maraj, 947 F.2d at 522-23.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence in this case passes the sufficiency test with flying colors.  A rational jury easily could have found that Noah was the person at EETS who prepared clients' tax returns and filed refund claims electronically. Given the ubiquity of the spurious data, it would have been reasonable, from this evidence alone, to infer that the appellant knowingly prepared and submitted the fabricated claims.  Here, however, there was considerably more.  The evidence also established that the appellant knew personally all the individuals whose tax records were falsified;  that he had access to the information necessary to complete the fraudulent forms;  that he processed the loan applications;  that he directed the conversion of the loan proceeds into cash;  and that he received the money.  We have no doubt but that these facts suffice to ground the verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant seeks to weaken this chain of inferences by offering us a new target.  We should overturn his conviction, he says, because the evidence, even if legally sufficient to support the jury's verdict, points more directly to the guilt of Shedrick Gayetay.  This importuning misperceives the proper office of appellate review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mere fact that the evidence in a case, viewed from the defendant's coign of vantage, points convincingly to another person as the guilty party does not prevent a conviction.  After all, it is for the jury to mull the evidence, assess the credibility of the witnesses, and draw such reasonable inferences as it may choose.  Once the jury performs that task and authors a verdict, judicial review thereafter must concentrate on whether the jury's interpretation is sustainable under the governing legal standards.  See United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 711 (1st Cir.1992) (explaining that a guilty verdict will be upheld as long as it \"is supported by a plausible rendition of the record\").  Whether the jury plausibly could have pointed the finger of blame at someone else is not the question.  In this instance, the conclusion that the jury reached is reasonable in light of the evidence presented at trial and there is no principled basis for overturning the verdict on the ground of evidentiary insufficiency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>B. Motion in Limine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some weeks prior to trial, the appellant moved in limine to exclude evidence of bogus tax filings apart from those described in the indictment's six counts.  On the brink of trial, the district court heard argument on the motion.  Defense counsel claimed that the introduction of the challenged evidence would be \"cumulative\" and \"highly prejudicial,\" and would consume too much preparation time.  Citing Fed.R.Evid. 404(b), the court denied the motion as premature in the absence of a specific evidentiary context.  During trial, the government offered only a small quantity of the challenged evidence, which with one exception was received absent any objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this venue, the appellant's new lawyer puts a fresh spin on the motion in limine.  He asseverates that the district court should have treated it as a request for a bill of particulars and granted it on this basis.  We are not persuaded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the court below, the appellant filed a document that he characterized as a motion in limine and, consistent with counsel's assertion that the admission of the challenged evidence would be cumulative and highly prejudicial, the court reasonably understood the motion as one implicating Rule 404(b).  Although a trial court may not rely woodenly on a motion's label and ignore its purport, this motion bore scant similarity to a prototypical motion for bill of particulars, see, e.g., United States v. Paiva, 892 F.2d 148, 154 (1st Cir.1989) (describing the purpose of such a bill), and the district court's decision to treat it as what it proclaimed itself to be--a motion to limit the introduction of proof of other, related bad acts at trial--cannot be faulted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That said, we discern no error in the court's refusal to grant the motion in limine.  Rule 404(b), which authorizes the admission of evidence of \"other crimes, wrongs, or acts\" committed by the defendant for purposes such as \"proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident,\" always must be read in concert with Rule 403, which provides for a balancing of probative value against unfairly prejudicial effect.  So read, the combination permits the trial court to exclude \"other bad acts\" evidence on the ground, inter alia, that it is likely to cause \"unfair prejudice\" or \"confusion [of] the issues,\" or that it probably will lead to \"needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\"  Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the district court denied the motion in limine without prejudice to later objection because the court could not determine satisfactorily in advance of trial whether the unfairly prejudicial effects (if any) of the evidence of other fraudulent tax filings substantially outweighed that evidence's probative worth.  This wait-and-see stance was reasonable under the circumstances.  See United States v. Griffin, 818 F.2d 97, 105 (1st Cir.1987);  Sperberg v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 519 F.2d 708, 712 (6th Cir.1975).  A court is not required to make judgment calls about admissibility a priori and out of context, and we reject the appellant's assertion that the court below abused its discretion in refusing to do so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor can the appellant be heard to complain about the lower court's admission of \"other bad acts\" evidence at trial.  During its case in chief, the government introduced evidence anent two fraudulent filings not specifically alluded to in the indictment, neither of which prompted a Rule 404(b) objection.  Consequently, there is no occasion for us to comment upon them.  It is settled in this circuit that, when the district court tentatively denies a pretrial motion in limine, or temporizes on it, the party objecting to the preliminary in limine determination must renew his objection during the trial, and the failure to do so forfeits any objection.  See Griffin, 818 F.2d at 105 (holding that to raise and preserve for review a claim of improperly constructing the Rule 403 balance, a party ordinarily cannot rely on the denial of a motion in limine but must object to the admission of the controversial evidence in the actual trial setting);  see also United States v. Holmquist, 36 F.3d 154, 166 (1st Cir.1994) (concluding that when a pretrial motion in limine is granted and the court \"clearly invites the adversely affected party to offer the evidence at sidebar for the purpose of reassessing the scope and effect of the order in the setting of the actual trial, the exclusion of evidence pursuant to that order may be challenged on appeal only if the party unsuccessfully attempts to offer such evidence in accordance with the terms specified in the order\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only other use of such evidence occurred when the appellant took the stand as part of the defense case.  The prosecutor cross-examined him about one of the first two incidents, again without objection, and also introduced evidence of a third fraudulent filing not specified in the indictment.  We must reach the Rule 404(b) issue in connection with that return, inasmuch as the appellant preserved his rights by means of a contemporaneous Rule 404(b) objection.  Doing so, we hold that the admission of that evidence--which involved a fraudulent return compiled in the name of Dahn (an acquaintance of Noah's)--was proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant staked his defense on the proposition that he was an innocent dupe, victimized by a lawless employee.  As the district court found, the spurious return was highly relevant to show the appellant's guilty knowledge, the existence of a criminal plan, and the absence of mistake, and its probative value outweighed any unfairly prejudicial effects.  Since this finding derives adequate support from the record, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the jury to consider the evidence.  See, e.g., United States v. Frankhauser, 80 F.3d 641, 648 (1st Cir.1996);  United States v. Aguilar-Aranceta, 58 F.3d 796, 798 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v. Rodriguez-Estrada, 877 F.2d 153, 155-56 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>C. The Right to Self-Representation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's most substantial argument on appeal implicates the right to self-representation.  His claim is straightforward.  He tells us that he repeatedly attempted to assert his right to act as his own lawyer, and that the district court (erroneously, in his view) refused his request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. What The Record Reveals.   On the first day of trial, after the jury had been empaneled but before opening statements, the court denied the appellant's motion in limine.  The following exchange then took place:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>DEFENSE COUNSEL:  Excuse me, your Honor.  I realize that this is highly unusual, but my client wants to express a desire to address the Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>THE COURT:  No. That's not appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>DEFENDANT:  I don't want to address the Court on issues between my counsel.  I request your Honor--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>THE COURT:  You be quiet.  You have a lawyer who speaks for you and that's enough.  Be seated, please, while I proceed with this trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record is silent with regard to the intended subject of the censored statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the third day of trial, the appellant personally presented a motion to proceed pro se.  The court heard the motion out of the jury's earshot.  The appellant expressed the view that by refusing to offer certain motions and evidence his appointed attorney \"caused me a lot of setback\" and \"have not assisted me.\"   Judge Lagueux pointed out the dangers inherent in the request, noting the appellant's apparent lack of understanding of the rules of evidence and predicting that, by proceeding pro se, the appellant would be \"putting himself in prison.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the next day, the dialogue resumed.  After again questioning the appellant's ability to represent himself without imperilling his case, the court finally denied the request, declaring that to allow it would cause \"a complete disruption of the proceedings.\"   The court then stated in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>THE COURT:  I'm satisfied that to allow you to defend yourself in this case would be a disruption, since we are almost through with the Government's case.  And to allow you to come in now and discharge your lawyer in midstream would be totally destructive of the orderly process of ... criminal law, the trial of cases....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>*   *   *   *   *   *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>Your motion is denied because the disruption of the proceedings outweighs your right to represent yourself.  If this matter had come up before trial, then I could have dealt with it.  I could have allowed you to represent yourself and have standby counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>DEFENDANT:  I didn't know that until we were into the trial--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>THE COURT:  But now that the trial has started, it's too disruptive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>DEFENDANT:  I didn't know that until we were into the trial before I found out what I found out.  Had I known before, I would have made this motion before the trial begins.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>THE COURT:  Well, it's too late.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant made one final allusion to the issue of self-representation on the afternoon of the fifth day of trial.  Since he neither mentions this incident in his brief nor relies upon it as comprising part of the assigned error, we do not address it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Discussion.  It is apodictic that a criminal defendant has a right to reject the appointment of counsel and represent himself at trial.  See Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 814-17, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 2530-32, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975);  see also U.S. Const. amend.  VI. Nevertheless, \"[t]he right to select or refuse specific counsel is always subject to practical courtroom constraints.\"  United States v. Betancourt-Arretuche, 933 F.2d 89, 93 (1st Cir.1991).  This has come to mean that, although a criminal defendant's right to serve as his own attorney is absolute if invoked clearly and distinctly prior to the beginning of his trial, the right of self-representation becomes qualified once trial is under way.  See United States v. Lawrence, 605 F.2d 1321, 1324 (4th Cir.1979);  United States ex rel. Maldonado v. Denno, 348 F.2d 12, 15 (2d Cir.1965).  At that point, the presiding judge, in his discretion, may deny a defendant's request to act as his own lawyer.  See Robards v. Rees, 789 F.2d 379, 384 (6th Cir.1986);  United States v. Dunlap, 577 F.2d 867, 868 (4th Cir.1978).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record in this case fails to show that Noah expressed a desire to represent himself before his trial commenced.  Although his appellate counsel maintains that we should infer an intention to make such a desire known to the court from the appellant's aborted effort to speak on his own behalf after the jury had been selected but before opening arguments, he points to nothing in the record--say, an offer of proof--that would support such an inference.  What is more, any such inference is belied by Noah's own statement, on the fourth day of trial, that he \"didn't know ... until we were into the trial\" that the court would have allowed him, upon seasonable request, to represent himself.  Indeed, Noah declared, \"[h]ad I known before, I would have made this motion before the trial begins.\"  (emphasis supplied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant's request to represent himself must be communicated to the court clearly and unambiguously.  See United States v. Bennett, 539 F.2d 45, 50 (10th Cir.1976).  Here, no such communication took place in advance of trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Consequently, the appellant has no valid claim to an absolute Sixth Amendment right to self-representation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion--that the appellant sought to represent himself only after his trial had commenced--leaves unresolved the propriety of the lower court's refusal to permit him to do so when he made such a request during the third and fourth days of trial.  We turn now to that question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court has considerable discretion to grant or deny a request for self-representation that is not presented until trial is under way.  See United States v. Singleton, 107 F.3d 1091, 1096 (4th Cir.)  (citing cases), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 118 S.Ct. 84, 139 L.Ed.2d 41 (1997).  But that discretion is not unbridled.  It is improper for the court to deny the defendant the right to serve as his own attorney solely because of a perceived lack of legal dexterity, see Faretta, 422 U.S. at 835, 95 S.Ct. at 2541, education, see Johnstone v. Kelly, 808 F.2d 214, 216 (2d Cir.1986), or expertise, see United States v. Price, 474 F.2d 1223, 1227 (9th Cir.1973).  Rather, in the last analysis, the court \"must balance the legitimate interests of the defendant in self-representation against the potential disruption of the proceedings already in progress.\"  Williams v. Bartlett, 44 F.3d 95, 99 n. 1 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record suggests that we should treat what occurred on the third and fourth trial days as two halves of a single entreaty and we accept the suggestion.  In addressing that two-day colloquy, the appellant points to Judge Lagueux's references to his lack of training and his likely inability to master relevant legal concepts as evidence of discretion run amok.  We think that this line of argument reads too much into too little.  While the judge did voice such concerns, the transcript persuades us that the decisive factor in his analysis was the effect that granting the motion would have had on the ongoing trial.  The judge commented more than once that the government's case was almost complete and that \"to allow [the defendant] to come in now and discharge [his] lawyer in midstream would be totally destructive of the orderly process of ... criminal law.\"   When all was said and done, Judge Lagueux premised the denial of the appellant's motion squarely on the fact that, in the circumstances at hand, the likely disruption of the proceedings militated against indulging the right of self-representation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reasonableness of this conclusion is scarcely open to question.  District courts have an institutional interest in avoiding the disruption of trial proceedings.  To permit a defendant to switch roles near the halfway point of a complicated criminal trial runs an obvious risk of dislocating both the court's docket and the orderly progression of the trial.  See, e.g., Robards, 789 F.2d at 384.   Then, too, such an abrupt about-face would have tended to prejudice the prosecution (which had put in most of its case without knowing that the appellant sought to appear as both lawyer and party).  Given these considerations, and bearing in mind the district court's entitlement to attach weight to the presence of competent trial counsel, see, e.g., Williams, 44 F.3d at 99 n. 1 (stating that the quality of counsel is among the criteria to be used in deciding whether to permit self-representation once a trial has begun), we do not believe that any abuse of discretion occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p>D. Recusal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, the appellant suggests that Judge Lagueux should have recused himself as biased in respect to the appellant's race, ethnicity, and homeland.  This is a serious accusation, and we treat it as such.  Bias of any kind, especially bias predicated on traits such as race, ethnicity, or national origin, is antithetic to the fundamental values upon which our system of justice rests.  Consequently, appellate courts must zealously guard not only against the actuality of judicial bias but against any appearance of it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, the appellant's charge is plainly unfounded.  It rests wholly on an isolated comment made by the judge to the appellant, a Liberian national, in the course of denying the mid-trial request to proceed pro se.  In an apparent effort to cushion the blow (that is, to help the appellant understand that he would receive a fair trial even though he would not be allowed to act as his own attorney), Judge Lagueux commented:  \"This is the United States of America.  You're given more rights here than you ever had in Liberia, I'm sure of that.\"   Although the judge's choice of phrase may have been infelicitous, the comment, when viewed in context, is entirely devoid of any trace of animus.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add, moreover, that the record indicates quite vividly that Judge Lagueux conducted himself throughout this eight-day trial in a fair, balanced, and wholly appropriate manner.  Under these circumstances, the assignment of error lacks merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p>E. The Special Skill Enhancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's final objection concerns the lower court's decision to increase his offense level (and, thus, his sentence) because he \"used a special skill, in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense.\"  USSG &#167; 3B1.3 (Nov.1995).  Clearly, the court supportably could have found that the appellant employed whatever skill he may have had to facilitate the fraud.  Thus, the issue reduces to whether the record sustains a finding that the sum total of the faculties that the appellant used in preparing crooked tax returns and filing them electronically constituted a \"special skill\" within the meaning of section 3B1.3.  The appellant answers this question in the negative;  he maintains that filing tax returns electronically is an abecedarian task that anyone can perform.  The government answers the question in the affirmative;  it maintains that the appellant had acquired a skill set not enjoyed by the public at large, namely, the combination of talents necessary to prepare and file tax returns electronically.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court shared the government's view and boosted the offense level by two notches in reliance on section 3B1.3.  Our review of this determination is bifurcated:  we consider the meaning of the term \"special skill\" de novo and then scrutinize the district court's application of the guideline to the discerned facts for clear error.  See United States v. Connell, 960 F.2d 191, 197-98 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sentencing Commission's application notes disclose that the term \"[s]pecial skill\" refers to \"a skill not possessed by members of the general public and usually requiring substantial education, training or licensing.\"  USSG &#167; 3B1.3, comment.  (n.2).  The note enumerates as examples of persons possessing special skills \"pilots, lawyers, doctors, accountants, chemists, and demolition experts.\"  Id. The appellant leans heavily on this language, emphasizing his comparative lack of education and the fact that he was not licensed as an accountant.  But the text will not bear the weight that the appellant loads upon it.  The use of the term \"usually\" in application note 2 signifies often, but not always.  Hence, neither formal education nor professional stature is a necessary concomitant for a special skill adjustment.  See United States v. Spencer, 4 F.3d 115, 120 (2d Cir.1993);  United States v. Hummer, 916 F.2d 186, 191 (4th Cir.1990).  To the contrary, a special skill can be derived from experience or from self-tutelage.  See, e.g., United States v. Gandy, 36 F.3d 912, 914 (10th Cir.1994);  United States v. Lavin, 27 F.3d 40, 41 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant has a fallback position.  He insists that, because tax preparation and the electronic filing of returns are relatively simple undertakings, the ability to accomplish these duties cannot be considered a special skill.  Even if this self-serving appraisal is accurate--a matter that we think is open to debate--nothing in the guidelines suggests that the specialness of the faculty necessarily hinges on the complexity of the task to be performed.  See United States v. Lewis, 41 F.3d 1209, 1214 (7th Cir.1994) (noting that even if \"an average person can accomplish a task at which someone with special training or skill is adept,\" that fact alone \"does not ... convert the activity in question into an ordinary or unspecialized activity\").  Thus, consistent with our view of the language and purpose of section 3B1.3, we hold that a skill can be special even though the activity to which the skill is applied is mundane.  The key is whether the defendant's skill set elevates him to a level of knowledge and proficiency that eclipses that possessed by the general public.  See, e.g., United States v. Petersen, 98 F.3d 502, 506-507 (9th Cir.1996);  United States v. Malgoza, 2 F.3d 1107, 1110-11 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, the district court's finding that the appellant exercised a cognizable special skill in committing the offenses of conviction is supportable.  The appellant was a professional tax preparer who, though not specially educated, was paid fees to process tax returns, file them electronically, and arrange refund anticipation loans.  In a case not unlike this one, the Second Circuit held that an accountant who prepared and filed false tax returns and W-2 forms for his infant children possessed a special skill that increased his chance of succeeding on the fraudulent refund claims.  See United States v. Fritzson, 979 F.2d 21, 22 (2d Cir.1992).  We find this holding persuasive, and we see no reason why the fact that the tax-return preparer is a self-taught practitioner rather than a formally trained accountant should make a dispositive difference.  Regardless of matters like licensure and degree, the appellant had to \"know and comprehend the extent of the duties and obligations imposed by the tax laws.\"  Id. at 22 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  And, moreover, we agree that a professional tax preparer's \"knowledge of the withholding process, including the roles of the claim and transmittal documents, and how and when to file them, exceeds the knowledge of the average person,\" id., and justifies a special skill enhancement in this case.  Indeed, to be successful in the particular corner of the tax trade that he occupied, Noah's specialized knowledge had to extend into the realm of cyberspace.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two other facts render this conclusion especially appropriate in this case and thus reinforce the district court's determination.  First, at all relevant times the IRS authorized only certain individuals--approved electronic return originators--to submit tax returns by computer.  Inasmuch as the appellant had secured such approval (albeit in the name of EETS), the sentencing court readily could find that he possessed a capability which was special in the sense that it was not enjoyed by the populace at large.  Second, the record reflects that the appellant procured the services of others by offering to teach them the techniques necessary to perfect electronic tax-return filings.  See supra note 2. This circumstance supports an inference that the skill set which the appellant amassed was neither widely known nor easily mastered, and thus buttresses the sentencing court's finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The short of it is that we discern no error in the district court's conclusion that a two-level upward adjustment was warranted.  The record allowed the court to find that the appellant had a special skill and used it to perpetrate the offenses of conviction.  No more is exigible.  See United States v. Young, 932 F.2d 1510, 1515 (D.C.Cir.1991) (\"Section 3B1.3 properly applies when a defendant uses some pre-existing, legitimate specialized skill not possessed by the general public to facilitate the commission or concealment of a crime.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of Ohio, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Mason is, of course, Erle Stanley Gardner's fictional lawyer-hero, idealized in a television series bearing his name, who possessed an uncanny aptitude for exonerating clients by casting blame elsewhere.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We present the pertinent facts in the light most favorable to the jury verdict, consistent with record support.  See United States v. Rivera-Gomez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"705988\"><a href=\"/opinion/705988/united-states-v-luis-raul-rivera-gomez/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">993</span></a></span>, 995 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v. Maraj, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"570481\"><a href=\"/opinion/570481/united-states-v-michael-maraj-united-states-of-america-v-sterling/\"><span class=\"volume\">947</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span>, 522 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1991, Noah, a citizen of Liberia, launched an enterprise called Easy Electronic Tax Service (EETS) in Chicago, Illinois.  The business held itself out as able to prepare tax returns, file them electronically with the IRS, and arrange refund anticipation loans through a participating bank.  At this point (and, indeed, at all times relevant to this case), taxpayers who wished to file their returns electronically could do so only through an approved electronic return originator.  To secure such approbation, a tax preparer had to complete an application form, undergo a suitability review, and demonstrate that it possessed the requisite hardware and software.  EETS filed such an application and the IRS approved it, thus paving the way for the company to participate in the electronic filing program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1993, the appellant opened an EETS office in Providence, Rhode Island, and hired several friends to staff the operation.  These fledgling employees had duties that ranged from answering the telephone to compiling client files to photocopying identification cards and W-2 forms.  None of the recruits had any relevant professional experience in preparing tax returns or perfecting electronic filings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Hence, the appellant alone was responsible for preparing clients' tax returns, transmitting the forms electronically, and arranging loans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due season, a tax-fraud scheme blossomed.  In addition to its customary, client-initiated tax filings, EETS from time to time submitted tax returns that bore the names and social security numbers of actual people, but which were embellished by concocted data (e.g., fictitious or altered W-2 forms, non-existent dependents).  Based on these commentitious returns, EETS secured refund anticipation loans payable to the \"taxpayers.\"   The appellant then asked various EETS employees to convert the checks representing the loan proceeds into cash and give the realized funds to him, mendaciously telling his minions that he already had given the named beneficiaries equivalent amounts from EETS's operational accounts.  In another iteration of the fraud, EETS from time to time would alter real clients' earnings statements, or increase the number of dependents, or both, in order to obtain loans based on larger-than-warranted refunds.  In these instances, the appellant would pocket the excess proceeds.  Either way, the participating bank would be made whole by means of the fraudulently secured refunds and the IRS would be left holding an empty bag.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The scheme proved to be pervasive:  after an investigation, the IRS identified EETS as the source of approximately 100 electronic returns, 60 of which contained apocryphal items.  Eighteen of those were entirely bogus.  All of the latter, including the returns that corresponded to the counts of conviction, involved individuals known personally to the appellant.  For example, EETS prepared a false W-2 form and filed a fraudulent tax return in the name of Fred Gayetay.  Gayetay's father, Shedrick Gayetay, was an EETS employee hired by Noah.  Similarly, EETS prepared fraudulent W-2 forms and other tax documents in the names of Prince and Varwoi Jordan.  The Jordan siblings were high school students whose mother, Elizabeth Powell, was a friend of Noah's and also dated Shedrick Gayetay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 10, 1996, a federal grand jury in the District of Rhode Island indicted the appellant on six counts of knowingly making and presenting false, fictitious, and fraudulent claims to the IRS in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 287 (1994).  Following an eight-day trial, the jury found the appellant guilty across the board.  Judge Lagueux sentenced him to a 33-month incarcerative term.  This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Noah's appellate counsel advances five assignments of error.  We address them in the sequence indicated in the initial paragraph of this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>A. Sufficiency of the Evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An appellate court plays a very circumscribed role in gauging the sufficiency of the evidentiary foundation upon which a criminal conviction rests.  The court of appeals neither weighs the credibility of the witnesses nor attempts to assess whether the prosecution succeeded in eliminating every possible theory consistent with the defendant's innocence.  See United States v. Echeverri, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597415\"><a href=\"/opinion/597415/united-states-v-marco-a-echeverri/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">675</span></a></span>, 677 (1st Cir.1993).  Instead, its task is to canvass the evidence (direct and circumstantial) in the light most agreeable to the prosecution and decide whether that evidence, including all plausible inferences extractable therefrom, enables a rational factfinder to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the charged crime.  See United States v. Saccoccia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196165\"><a href=\"/opinion/196165/united-states-v-saccoccia/\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">754</span></a></span>, 773-74 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1105</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1322</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">474</span></span> (1996);  Maraj, 947 F.2d at 522-23.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence in this case passes the sufficiency test with flying colors.  A rational jury easily could have found that Noah was the person at EETS who prepared clients' tax returns and filed refund claims electronically. Given the ubiquity of the spurious data, it would have been reasonable, from this evidence alone, to infer that the appellant knowingly prepared and submitted the fabricated claims.  Here, however, there was considerably more.  The evidence also established that the appellant knew personally all the individuals whose tax records were falsified;  that he had access to the information necessary to complete the fraudulent forms;  that he processed the loan applications;  that he directed the conversion of the loan proceeds into cash;  and that he received the money.  We have no doubt but that these facts suffice to ground the verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant seeks to weaken this chain of inferences by offering us a new target.  We should overturn his conviction, he says, because the evidence, even if legally sufficient to support the jury's verdict, points more directly to the guilt of Shedrick Gayetay.  This importuning misperceives the proper office of appellate review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mere fact that the evidence in a case, viewed from the defendant's coign of vantage, points convincingly to another person as the guilty party does not prevent a conviction.  After all, it is for the jury to mull the evidence, assess the credibility of the witnesses, and draw such reasonable inferences as it may choose.  Once the jury performs that task and authors a verdict, judicial review thereafter must concentrate on whether the jury's interpretation is sustainable under the governing legal standards.  See United States v. Ortiz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584511\"><a href=\"/opinion/584511/united-states-v-ruben-ortiz-aka-ruben-ortiz-de-jesus-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">966</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">707</span></a></span>, 711 (1st Cir.1992) (explaining that a guilty verdict will be upheld as long as it \"is supported by a plausible rendition of the record\").  Whether the jury plausibly could have pointed the finger of blame at someone else is not the question.  In this instance, the conclusion that the jury reached is reasonable in light of the evidence presented at trial and there is no principled basis for overturning the verdict on the ground of evidentiary insufficiency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>B. Motion in Limine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some weeks prior to trial, the appellant moved in limine to exclude evidence of bogus tax filings apart from those described in the indictment's six counts.  On the brink of trial, the district court heard argument on the motion.  Defense counsel claimed that the introduction of the challenged evidence would be \"cumulative\" and \"highly prejudicial,\" and would consume too much preparation time.  Citing Fed.R.Evid. 404(b), the court denied the motion as premature in the absence of a specific evidentiary context.  During trial, the government offered only a small quantity of the challenged evidence, which with one exception was received absent any objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this venue, the appellant's new lawyer puts a fresh spin on the motion in limine.  He asseverates that the district court should have treated it as a request for a bill of particulars and granted it on this basis.  We are not persuaded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the court below, the appellant filed a document that he characterized as a motion in limine and, consistent with counsel's assertion that the admission of the challenged evidence would be cumulative and highly prejudicial, the court reasonably understood the motion as one implicating Rule 404(b).  Although a trial court may not rely woodenly on a motion's label and ignore its purport, this motion bore scant similarity to a prototypical motion for bill of particulars, see, e.g., United States v. Paiva, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"534182\"><a href=\"/opinion/534182/united-states-v-james-earl-paiva/\"><span class=\"volume\">892</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span>, 154 (1st Cir.1989) (describing the purpose of such a bill), and the district court's decision to treat it as what it proclaimed itself to be--a motion to limit the introduction of proof of other, related bad acts at trial--cannot be faulted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That said, we discern no error in the court's refusal to grant the motion in limine.  Rule 404(b), which authorizes the admission of evidence of \"other crimes, wrongs, or acts\" committed by the defendant for purposes such as \"proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident,\" always must be read in concert with Rule 403, which provides for a balancing of probative value against unfairly prejudicial effect.  So read, the combination permits the trial court to exclude \"other bad acts\" evidence on the ground, inter alia, that it is likely to cause \"unfair prejudice\" or \"confusion [of] the issues,\" or that it probably will lead to \"needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\"  Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the district court denied the motion in limine without prejudice to later objection because the court could not determine satisfactorily in advance of trial whether the unfairly prejudicial effects (if any) of the evidence of other fraudulent tax filings substantially outweighed that evidence's probative worth.  This wait-and-see stance was reasonable under the circumstances.  See United States v. Griffin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488020\"><a href=\"/opinion/488020/united-states-v-barry-j-griffin/\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span>, 105 (1st Cir.1987);  Sperberg v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"328852\"><a href=\"/opinion/328852/lawrence-r-sperberg-v-goodyear-tire-rubber-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">708</span></a></span>, 712 (6th Cir.1975).  A court is not required to make judgment calls about admissibility a priori and out of context, and we reject the appellant's assertion that the court below abused its discretion in refusing to do so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor can the appellant be heard to complain about the lower court's admission of \"other bad acts\" evidence at trial.  During its case in chief, the government introduced evidence anent two fraudulent filings not specifically alluded to in the indictment, neither of which prompted a Rule 404(b) objection.  Consequently, there is no occasion for us to comment upon them.  It is settled in this circuit that, when the district court tentatively denies a pretrial motion in limine, or temporizes on it, the party objecting to the preliminary in limine determination must renew his objection during the trial, and the failure to do so forfeits any objection.  See Griffin, 818 F.2d at 105 (holding that to raise and preserve for review a claim of improperly constructing the Rule 403 balance, a party ordinarily cannot rely on the denial of a motion in limine but must object to the admission of the controversial evidence in the actual trial setting);  see also United States v. Holmquist, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195622\"><a href=\"/opinion/195622/united-states-v-holmquist/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span>, 166 (1st Cir.1994) (concluding that when a pretrial motion in limine is granted and the court \"clearly invites the adversely affected party to offer the evidence at sidebar for the purpose of reassessing the scope and effect of the order in the setting of the actual trial, the exclusion of evidence pursuant to that order may be challenged on appeal only if the party unsuccessfully attempts to offer such evidence in accordance with the terms specified in the order\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only other use of such evidence occurred when the appellant took the stand as part of the defense case.  The prosecutor cross-examined him about one of the first two incidents, again without objection, and also introduced evidence of a third fraudulent filing not specified in the indictment.  We must reach the Rule 404(b) issue in connection with that return, inasmuch as the appellant preserved his rights by means of a contemporaneous Rule 404(b) objection.  Doing so, we hold that the admission of that evidence--which involved a fraudulent return compiled in the name of Dahn (an acquaintance of Noah's)--was proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant staked his defense on the proposition that he was an innocent dupe, victimized by a lawless employee.  As the district court found, the spurious return was highly relevant to show the appellant's guilty knowledge, the existence of a criminal plan, and the absence of mistake, and its probative value outweighed any unfairly prejudicial effects.  Since this finding derives adequate support from the record, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the jury to consider the evidence.  See, e.g., United States v. Frankhauser, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196693\"><a href=\"/opinion/196693/united-states-v-frankhauser/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span>, 648 (1st Cir.1996);  United States v.

His claim is straightforward.  He tells us that he repeatedly attempted to assert his right to act as his own lawyer, and that the district court (erroneously, in his view) refused his request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. What The Record Reveals.   On the first day of trial, after the jury had been empaneled but before opening statements, the court denied the appellant's motion in limine.  The following exchange then took place:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>DEFENSE COUNSEL:  Excuse me, your Honor.

I request your Honor--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>THE COURT:  You be quiet.  You have a lawyer who speaks for you and that's enough.  Be seated, please, while I proceed with this trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record is silent with regard to the intended subject of the censored statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the third day of trial, the appellant personally presented a motion to proceed pro se.  The court heard the motion out of the jury's earshot.  The appellant expressed the view that by refusing to offer certain motions and evidence his appointed attorney \"caused me a lot of setback\" and \"have not assisted me.\"   Judge Lagueux pointed out the dangers inherent in the request, noting the appellant's apparent lack of understanding of the rules of evidence and predicting that, by proceeding pro se, the appellant would be \"putting himself in prison.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the next day, the dialogue resumed.  After again questioning the appellant's ability to represent himself without imperilling his case, the court finally denied the request, declaring that to allow it would cause \"a complete disruption of the proceedings.\"   The court then stated in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>THE COURT:  I'm satisfied that to allow you to defend yourself in this case would be a disruption, since we are almost through with the Government's case.  And to allow you to come in now and discharge your lawyer in midstream would be totally destructive of the orderly process of ... criminal law, the trial of cases....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>*   *   *   *   *   *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>Your motion is denied because the disruption of the proceedings outweighs your right to represent yourself.  If this matter had come up before trial, then I could have dealt with it.  I could have allowed you to represent yourself and have standby counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>DEFENDANT:  I didn't know that until we were into the trial--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>THE COURT:  But now that the trial has started, it's too disruptive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>DEFENDANT:  I didn't know that until we were into the trial before I found out what I found out.

Since he neither mentions this incident in his brief nor relies upon it as comprising part of the assigned error, we do not address it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Discussion.  It is apodictic that a criminal defendant has a right to reject the appointment of counsel and represent himself at trial.  See Faretta v. California, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109309\"><a href=\"/opinion/109309/faretta-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">806</span></a></span>, 814-17, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109309\"><a href=\"/opinion/109309/faretta-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">562</span></a></span> (1975);  see also U.S. Const. amend.  VI. Nevertheless, \"[t]he right to select or refuse specific counsel is always subject to practical courtroom constraints.\"  United States v. Betancourt-Arretuche, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"561251\"><a href=\"/opinion/561251/united-states-v-eugenio-betancourt-arretuche/\"><span class=\"volume\">933</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span>, 93 (1st Cir.1991).  This has come to mean that, although a criminal defendant's right to serve as his own attorney is absolute if invoked clearly and distinctly prior to the beginning of his trial, the right of self-representation becomes qualified once trial is under way.  See United States v. Lawrence, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"370150\"><a href=\"/opinion/370150/united-states-v-albert-a-lawrence/\"><span class=\"volume\">605</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1321</span></a></span>, 1324 (4th Cir.1979);  United States ex rel.

At that point, the presiding judge, in his discretion, may deny a defendant's request to act as his own lawyer.  See Robards v. Rees, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"469113\"><a href=\"/opinion/469113/joseph-frederick-robards-v-john-rees-superintendent-kentucky-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">789</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">379</span></a></span>, 384 (6th Cir.1986);  United States v.

Although his appellate counsel maintains that we should infer an intention to make such a desire known to the court from the appellant's aborted effort to speak on his own behalf after the jury had been selected but before opening arguments, he points to nothing in the record--say, an offer of proof--that would support such an inference.  What is more, any such inference is belied by Noah's own statement, on the fourth day of trial, that he \"didn't know ... until we were into the trial\" that the court would have allowed him, upon seasonable request, to represent himself.  Indeed, Noah declared, \"[h]ad I known before, I would have made this motion before the trial begins.\"  (emphasis supplied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant's request to represent himself must be communicated to the court clearly and unambiguously.  See United States v. Bennett, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"337813\"><a href=\"/opinion/337813/united-states-v-odell-bennett/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 50 (10th Cir.1976).  Here, no such communication took place in advance of trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Consequently, the appellant has no valid claim to an absolute Sixth Amendment right to self-representation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion--that the appellant sought to represent himself only after his trial had commenced--leaves unresolved the propriety of the lower court's refusal to permit him to do so when he made such a request during the third and fourth days of trial.  We turn now to that question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court has considerable discretion to grant or deny a request for self-representation that is not presented until trial is under way.  See United States v. Singleton, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"736916\"><a href=\"/opinion/736916/united-states-v-frederick-keith-singleton/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1091</span></a></span>, 1096 (4th Cir.)

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></span> (1997).  But that discretion is not unbridled.  It is improper for the court to deny the defendant the right to serve as his own attorney solely because of a perceived lack of legal dexterity, see Faretta, 422 U.S. at 835, 95 S.Ct. at 2541, education, see Johnstone v. Kelly, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"480991\"><a href=\"/opinion/480991/gregory-johnstone-v-walter-j-kelly-superintendent-attica-correctional/\"><span class=\"volume\">808</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">214</span></a></span>, 216 (2d Cir.1986), or expertise, see United States v.

Rather, in the last analysis, the court \"must balance the legitimate interests of the defendant in self-representation against the potential disruption of the proceedings already in progress.\"  Williams v. Bartlett, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"686435\"><a href=\"/opinion/686435/jerome-williams-v-george-bartlett-howard-r-relin-monroe-county-district/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></a></span>, 99 n. 1 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record suggests that we should treat what occurred on the third and fourth trial days as two halves of a single entreaty and we accept the suggestion.  In addressing that two-day colloquy, the appellant points to Judge Lagueux's references to his lack of training and his likely inability to master relevant legal concepts as evidence of discretion run amok.  We think that this line of argument reads too much into too little.  While the judge did voice such concerns, the transcript persuades us that the decisive factor in his analysis was the effect that granting the motion would have had on the ongoing trial.  The judge commented more than once that the government's case was almost complete and that \"to allow [the defendant] to come in now and discharge [his] lawyer in midstream would be totally destructive of the orderly process of ... criminal law.\"   When all was said and done, Judge Lagueux premised the denial of the appellant's motion squarely on the fact that, in the circumstances at hand, the likely disruption of the proceedings militated against indulging the right of self-representation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reasonableness of this conclusion is scarcely open to question.  District courts have an institutional interest in avoiding the disruption of trial proceedings.  To permit a defendant to switch roles near the halfway point of a complicated criminal trial runs an obvious risk of dislocating both the court's docket and the orderly progression of the trial.  See, e.g., Robards, 789 F.2d at 384.   Then, too, such an abrupt about-face would have tended to prejudice the prosecution (which had put in most of its case without knowing that the appellant sought to appear as both lawyer and party).  Given these considerations, and bearing in mind the district court's entitlement to attach weight to the presence of competent trial counsel, see, e.g., Williams, 44 F.3d at 99 n. 1 (stating that the quality of counsel is among the criteria to be used in deciding whether to permit self-representation once a trial has begun), we do not believe that any abuse of discretion occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p>D. Recusal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, the appellant suggests that Judge Lagueux should have recused himself as biased in respect to the appellant's race, ethnicity, and homeland.  This is a serious accusation, and we treat it as such.  Bias of any kind, especially bias predicated on traits such as race, ethnicity, or national origin, is antithetic to the fundamental values upon which our system of justice rests.  Consequently, appellate courts must zealously guard not only against the actuality of judicial bias but against any appearance of it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, the appellant's charge is plainly unfounded.  It rests wholly on an isolated comment made by the judge to the appellant, a Liberian national, in the course of denying the mid-trial request to proceed pro se.  In an apparent effort to cushion the blow (that is, to help the appellant understand that he would receive a fair trial even though he would not be allowed to act as his own attorney), Judge Lagueux commented:  \"This is the United States of America.  You're given more rights here than you ever had in Liberia, I'm sure of that.\"   Although the judge's choice of phrase may have been infelicitous, the comment, when viewed in context, is entirely devoid of any trace of animus.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add, moreover, that the record indicates quite vividly that Judge Lagueux conducted himself throughout this eight-day trial in a fair, balanced, and wholly appropriate manner.  Under these circumstances, the assignment of error lacks merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p>E. The Special Skill Enhancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's final objection concerns the lower court's decision to increase his offense level (and, thus, his sentence) because he \"used a special skill, in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense.\"  USSG &#167; 3B1.3 (Nov.1995).  Clearly, the court supportably could have found that the appellant employed whatever skill he may have had to facilitate the fraud.  Thus, the issue reduces to whether the record sustains a finding that the sum total of the faculties that the appellant used in preparing crooked tax returns and filing them electronically constituted a \"special skill\" within the meaning of section 3B1.3.  The appellant answers this question in the negative;  he maintains that filing tax returns electronically is an abecedarian task that anyone can perform.  The government answers the question in the affirmative;  it maintains that the appellant had acquired a skill set not enjoyed by the public at large, namely, the combination of talents necessary to prepare and file tax returns electronically.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court shared the government's view and boosted the offense level by two notches in reliance on section 3B1.3.  Our review of this determination is bifurcated:  we consider the meaning of the term \"special skill\" de novo and then scrutinize the district court's application of the guideline to the discerned facts for clear error.  See United States v. Connell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580693\"><a href=\"/opinion/580693/united-states-v-gerald-connell/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">191</span></a></span>, 197-98 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sentencing Commission's application notes disclose that the term \"[s]pecial skill\" refers to \"a skill not possessed by members of the general public and usually requiring substantial education, training or licensing.\"  USSG &#167; 3B1.3, comment.  (n.2).  The note enumerates as examples of persons possessing special skills \"pilots, lawyers, doctors, accountants, chemists, and demolition experts.\"  Id. The appellant leans heavily on this language, emphasizing his comparative lack of education and the fact that he was not licensed as an accountant.  But the text will not bear the weight that the appellant loads upon it.  The use of the term \"usually\" in application note 2 signifies often, but not always.  Hence, neither formal education nor professional stature is a necessary concomitant for a special skill adjustment.  See United States v. Spencer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"629121\"><a href=\"/opinion/629121/united-states-of-america-appellee-cross-appellant-v-robert-e-spencer/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span>, 120 (2d Cir.1993);  United States v.

To the contrary, a special skill can be derived from experience or from self-tutelage.  See, e.g., United States v. Gandy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"678896\"><a href=\"/opinion/678896/united-states-v-paul-stephen-gandy/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">912</span></a></span>, 914 (10th Cir.1994);  United States v.

He insists that, because tax preparation and the electronic filing of returns are relatively simple undertakings, the ability to accomplish these duties cannot be considered a special skill.  Even if this self-serving appraisal is accurate--a matter that we think is open to debate--nothing in the guidelines suggests that the specialness of the faculty necessarily hinges on the complexity of the task to be performed.  See United States v. Lewis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"683564\"><a href=\"/opinion/683564/united-states-v-james-f-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1209</span></a></span>, 1214 (7th Cir.1994) (noting that even if \"an average person can accomplish a task at which someone with special training or skill is adept,\" that fact alone \"does not ... convert the activity in question into an ordinary or unspecialized activity\").  Thus, consistent with our view of the language and purpose of section 3B1.3, we hold that a skill can be special even though the activity to which the skill is applied is mundane.  The key is whether the defendant's skill set elevates him to a level of knowledge and proficiency that eclipses that possessed by the general public.  See, e.g., United States v. Petersen, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"728060\"><a href=\"/opinion/728060/united-states-v-justin-tanner-petersen/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span>, 506-507 (9th Cir.1996);  United States v. Malgoza, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"628327\"><a href=\"/opinion/628327/united-states-v-michael-malgoza-and-tomas-monte/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1107</span></a></span>, 1110-11 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, the district court's finding that the appellant exercised a cognizable special skill in committing the offenses of conviction is supportable.  The appellant was a professional tax preparer who, though not specially educated, was paid fees to process tax returns, file them electronically, and arrange refund anticipation loans.  In a case not unlike this one, the Second Circuit held that an accountant who prepared and filed false tax returns and W-2 forms for his infant children possessed a special skill that increased his chance of succeeding on the fraudulent refund claims.  See United States v. Fritzson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"594422\"><a href=\"/opinion/594422/united-states-v-leonard-fritzson/\"><span class=\"volume\">979</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 22 (2d Cir.1992).  We find this holding persuasive, and we see no reason why the fact that the tax-return preparer is a self-taught practitioner rather than a formally trained accountant should make a dispositive difference.  Regardless of matters like licensure and degree, the appellant had to \"know and comprehend the extent of the duties and obligations imposed by the tax laws.\"  Id. at 22 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  And, moreover, we agree that a professional tax preparer's \"knowledge of the withholding process, including the roles of the claim and transmittal documents, and how and when to file them, exceeds the knowledge of the average person,\" id., and justifies a special skill enhancement in this case.  Indeed, to be successful in the particular corner of the tax trade that he occupied, Noah's specialized knowledge had to extend into the realm of cyberspace.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two other facts render this conclusion especially appropriate in this case and thus reinforce the district court's determination.  First, at all relevant times the IRS authorized only certain individuals--approved electronic return originators--to submit tax returns by computer.  Inasmuch as the appellant had secured such approval (albeit in the name of EETS), the sentencing court readily could find that he possessed a capability which was special in the sense that it was not enjoyed by the populace at large.  Second, the record reflects that the appellant procured the services of others by offering to teach them the techniques necessary to perfect electronic tax-return filings.  See supra note 2. This circumstance supports an inference that the skill set which the appellant amassed was neither widely known nor easily mastered, and thus buttresses the sentencing court's finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The short of it is that we discern no error in the district court's conclusion that a two-level upward adjustment was warranted.  The record allowed the court to find that the appellant had a special skill and used it to perpetrate the offenses of conviction.  No more is exigible.  See United States v. Young, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"561231\"><a href=\"/opinion/561231/united-states-v-jerome-young-aka-akbar-muhammed/\"><span class=\"volume\">932</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1510</span></a></span>, 1515 (D.C.Cir.1991) (\"Section 3B1.3 properly applies when a defendant uses some pre-existing, legitimate specialized skill not possessed by the general public to facilitate the commission or concealment of a crime.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of Ohio, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Mason is, of course, Erle Stanley Gardner's fictional lawyer-hero, idealized in a television series bearing his name, who possessed an uncanny aptitude for exonerating clients by casting blame elsewhere.  See generally David McCord, \"But Perry Mason Made It Look So Easy!\":  The Admissibility Of Evidence Offered By A Criminal Defendant To Suggest That Someone Else Is Guilty, 63 Tenn.  L.Rev. 917 (1996)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Indeed, in lieu of paying wages, the appellant compensated many of these neophytes by offering to teach them how to prepare and file tax returns via the computer</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The objection on the ground of \"too much preparation time\" is not persuasive.  There were only eighteen totally bogus returns and, if more preparation time were needed, defense counsel could have sought a continuance (which he did not do).  Moreover, the motion sought to exclude all such evidence, not to require the government to specify which returns it would offer in evidence.  And in all events, given the minute quantity of such evidence actually offered by the government, see infra, any error would have been harmless</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> As mentioned above, the appellant's initial attempt to address the court occurred after the jury had been empaneled.  Inasmuch as the ensuing exchange cannot reasonably be viewed as an assertion of the right to proceed pro se, we need not resolve the question of whether the invocation of that right after jury selection should be deemed the functional equivalent of a pretrial assertion</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We note that the appellant lodged no contemporaneous objection to this remark (say, by seeking the judge's recusal then and there or by moving for a mistrial).  In all likelihood, then, the argument that he now advances is procedurally defaulted.  See United States v. Kimball, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"710326\"><a href=\"/opinion/710326/united-states-v-james-b-kimball/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">269</span></a></span>, 273 (10th Cir.1995) (reiterating that \"the party seeking recusal ... must do so in a timely fashion\");  United States v.
