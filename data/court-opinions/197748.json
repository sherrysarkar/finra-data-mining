The parties in this case have\r                                           \r\n\nbeen engaged in a heated battle over the proper setting for their\r\n\nunderlying legal dispute.   Appellee MCI Telecommunications Corp.\r\n\ninsists that the  conflict must be resolved  through arbitration,\r\n\nwhile appellant  Matrix  Communications Corp.  asserts  that  the\r\n\narbitration clause in the parties' contract  does not apply here,\r\n\nand that it is entitled to a judicial forum for its claims.   The\r\n\ndistrict court sided with MCI -- thus ordering arbitration -- and\r\n\nthen  rejected Matrix's motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) to set\r\n\naside that  ruling based  on newly  discovered evidence.   Matrix\r\n\nappeals  both the  judgment  on  the merits  and  the Rule  60(b)\r\n\ndecision.  After  close review of the tangled procedural backdrop\r\n\nand the substantive issues, we affirm.\r\n\n               I. Factual and Procedural Background\r                                                             \r\n\n     Little  needs to  be said  about  the companies'  underlying\r\n\ndispute,  which arises from an October 1995 agreement (the \"Agent\r\n\nAgreement\") in which  MCI gave Matrix limited agency  to sell MCI\r\n\nservices.    The   Agent  Agreement   provided  for   substantial\r\n\ncommissions if  Matrix generated  a specified  minimum amount  of\r\n\nrevenue for MCI.  Matrix alleged, inter alia, that MCI improperly\r                                                      \r\n\nterminated the Agent  Agreement eight months later, in June 1996,\r\n\nbecause Matrix was so successful in obtaining  customers that MCI\r\n\nowed it  more than  one billion dollars  in commissions  that the\r\n\ncorporation did not wish to  pay.  MCI countered that termination\r\n\nwas proper  because  Matrix  breached  the  terms  of  the  Agent\r\n\nAgreement in various ways.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n     Following   MCI's   termination,   Matrix  filed   suit   in\r\n\nMassachusetts state  court.  MCI  removed the  action to  federal\r\n\ncourt.    It  then  moved  to  stay  the  litigation  and  compel\r\n\narbitration, on the ground that  the language of the  arbitration\r\n\nclause  in  the  Agent  Agreement  unambiguously   evidenced  the\r\n\nparties'  intent  to  arbitrate all  disputes  arising  from that\r\n\nagreement.  The provision, contained in paragraph 22 of the Agent\r\n\nAgreement, states:\r\n\n     Any  dispute  relating  to   this  Agreement  shall  be\r\n     submitted for  binding arbitration  in accordance  with\r\n     the  rules  contained  in  MCI Tariff  FCC  No.  1  and\r\n     judgement[sic]  on  any award  entered  therein may  be\r\n     entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\r\n\nMatrix  opposed the  motion to  stay, arguing  that,  because MCI\r\n\nTariff FCC No. 1 (\"the Tariff\") expressly  limited arbitration to\r\n\ncustomer billing  disputes of $10,000 or more, and Matrix neither\r\n\nwas a customer nor had a billing  dispute of any amount with MCI,\r\n\nthe arbitration clause did not apply to its dispute.1\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1 A tariff is a detailed compilation of charges, regulations\r\nand   other   relevant  information   about   the   provision  of\r\ntelecommunications services  to the  public that common  carriers\r\nlike MCI are required to file with the FCC.  MCI Tariff FCC No. 1\r\nis a voluminous  document whose \"Section  B,\" labeled \"Rules  and\r\nRegulations,\"  spans  34  pages  and  contains  nineteen separate\r\nrules.   Rule  No. 7  is labeled  \"Payment Arrangements\"  and has\r\ntwenty-one subsections.   One  of those  subsections, B-7.13,  is\r\nentitled \"Arbitration of disputes,\" and states, in part:\r\n\n     All  disputes  concerning   or  affecting  payment   of\r\n     invoices  issued after  February 28,  1994 for  charges\r\n     totaling  $10,000 and  above  may be  resolved  through\r\n     binding arbitration.\r\n\nSubsection B-7.13  is further  divided into  numerous parts  that\r\ndetail the procedures  to be used in such  arbitrations.  Section\r\n.1327,  for example,  requires  the Responding  Party  to file  a\r\nwritten  answer within 17  days after the  arbitration commences;\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n      Judge  Harrington of the  United States District  Court for\r\n\nthe District of  Massachusetts held a hearing on  MCI's motion to\r\n\ncompel arbitration  on September  27, 1996.   Later that  day, he\r\n\nsigned   an  order  granting  the  motion,  concluding  that  the\r\n\narbitration  clause unambiguously reflected  an intention  by the\r\n\nparties to arbitrate all disputes  relating to the Agreement.  In\r                                  \r\n\nhis view, the Tariff  was referenced not to  define the scope  of\r\n\nthe agreement  to arbitrate but  to provide the  procedural rules\r\n\nunder which any arbitration would take place.  \r\n\n     The same day,  Matrix filed a notice  of voluntary dismissal\r\n\nunder  Fed. R.  Civ.  P. 41(a)(1)(i).2    In  a letter  to  Judge\r\n\nHarrington,  Matrix's  counsel  explained  that  the company  had\r\n\ndecided to  ask the  arbitrator to rule  on whether  Matrix could\r\n\nreceive all  the relief  it sought through  arbitration.   If so,\r\n\nMatrix would consent to continue the  arbitration; if not, Matrix\r\n\nwould refile its action in federal court.\r\n\n     Judge Harrington dismissed the action.  On September 30, the\r\n\nday  both the  order  compelling  arbitration  and the  grant  of\r\n\ndismissal  were entered  on  the  docket,  Matrix  initiated  the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nsection  .133 directs the case  manager to hold an administrative\r\nconference within nine  days of  the arbitration's  commencement;\r\nunder section .1341, the appointed arbitrator may be removed only\r\nfor  bias or  \"other good  cause\"; section  .135 provides  for an\r\nexchange of  documents and other information within 23 days after\r\nthe arbitration  commences; and  section .1391  provides for  the\r\nprivacy of all arbitration conferences and hearings. \r\n\n     2 Although  Judge Harrington  may have  ruled before  Matrix\r\nfiled  for dismissal, it appears that Matrix did not learn of the\r\nruling until later,  and believed at the  time it filed  that the\r\ndecision would not be made for several days.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\narbitration by filing a  claim with J.A.M.S./Endispute  (\"JAMS\"),\r\n\nthe  arbitration administrator designated  by MCI in  its Tariff.\r\n\nMatrix argued to the arbitrator, as it had to the court, that its\r\n\nclaims were not  arbitrable, and again relied on a reading of the\r\n\narbitration clause  that limited  its scope  to billing  disputes\r\n\nexceeding $10,000.\r\n\n     MCI responded  two days later,  on October 2, by  filing its\r\n\nown  action in  federal court  seeking to  compel arbitration  of\r\n\nMatrix's claims.  Although Matrix was at that point participating\r\n\nin arbitration,  MCI was concerned  that Matrix would  not follow\r\n\nthrough if the arbitrator decided the threshold questions against\r\n\nMatrix's position.   Because  of his  involvement in the  earlier\r\n\nproceeding,  Judge  Harrington  was  assigned  the  MCI   action.\r\n\nWithout additional  hearings  or  any  responsive  pleading  from\r\n\nMatrix, he  entered an order  on October 10 compelling  Matrix to\r\n\narbitrate all of its claims and awarding MCI attorney's fees.\r\n\n     Meanwhile, the  arbitration that  Matrix had  initiated went\r\n\nforward,  and, on  December 10, 1996,  the arbitrator  ruled that\r\n\nMatrix's claims were arbitrable but  that certain types of relief\r\n\nsought by Matrix, including multiple damages and attorney's fees,\r\n\nwere unavailable  in the  arbitration because  the Tariff  barred\r\n\nsuch  remedies.   In  February  1997, Matrix  filed  a motion  in\r\n\ndistrict court under  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b),  seeking relief from\r\n\nthe October 10 order.  Matrix contended that MCI had fraudulently\r\n\ninduced  it to  enter into  the arbitration  clause in  the Agent\r\n\nAgreement by  concealing an agreement  between JAMS and  MCI that\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nprovided  for  a  close  working  relationship  between  the  two\r\n\ncompanies and specified various payments and services to be given\r\n\nby  MCI to  JAMS.    Matrix argued  that  the MCI/JAMS  Agreement\r\n\nconstituted newly discovered evidence of bias on the part of JAMS\r\n\nin favor of MCI.   MCI opposed the motion, filing  affidavits and\r\n\nother  materials  in  support  of  its  position  that  the  JAMS\r\n\nAgreement had not been concealed and did not evidence bias on the\r\n\npart either of JAMS, or, more importantly, the arbitrator.\r\n\n     Following a hearing,  District Court Judge Saris  denied the\r\n\nRule 60(b) motion,3 concluding that Matrix had failed to show the\r\n\nelements  necessary for post-judgment relief, see Hoult v. Hoult,\r                                                                          \r\n\n57 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir. 1995).  See infra at 16.\r                                                    \r\n\n     Matrix  appeals from the  October 10, 1996  order compelling\r\n\narbitration of  its claims, and the March  27, 1997 denial of its\r\n\nrule 60(b) motion.\r\n\n                          II. Discussion\r                                                  \r\n\n     Before discussing  the district court's October  10 judgment\r\n\nand its subsequent  rejection of Matrix's  Rule 60(b) motion,  we\r\n\nmust  address a threshold  issue raised by MCI.   It claims that,\r\n\nbecause Matrix  voluntarily submitted the  issue of arbitrability\r\n\nto  the arbitrator, who then  determined that Matrix's claims are\r\n\narbitrable,  Matrix  cannot  at   this  juncture  challenge   the\r\n\narbitrator's  authority  to  hear the  case.    This  appeal, MCI\r\n\ncontends, is moot.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3 The case had been  reassigned to Judge Saris subsequent to\r\nJudge Harrington's October 10, 1996 order.\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n     We  have little  difficulty in  concluding  that the  appeal\r\n\nshould go  forward.  From  the outset, Matrix  explicitly advised\r\n\nthe district  court that it would return  to the courtroom if the\r\n\narbitrator ruled that  Matrix could not obtain all  the relief it\r\n\nsought  in  the  arbitral forum.    Although  MCI  cites language\r\n\nsuggesting that Matrix  later agreed to  arbitrate its claims  if\r\n\nthe  arbitrator ruled that they were arbitrable, we are persuaded\r\n\nthat that  language was  unfairly drawn out  of context  and that\r\n\nMatrix's actual position  has been consistently in  opposition to\r\n\nresolving  its claims through arbitration unless it were possible\r\n\nto obtain  full relief.   Indeed, we  think it  disingenuous, and\r\n\nbordering on effrontery, for MCI to suggest otherwise.\r\n\n     We now turn to the issues raised by Matrix on appeal.\r\n\n     A. The October 10 Ruling\r                                       \r\n\n     At the  outset of  our analysis, it  is worth  recalling the\r\n\ncontext of the district court's  decision on October 10 to compel\r\n\narbitration.  The motion  on which the  court ruled was filed  by\r\n\nMCI on October 2.   Only three working days earlier, on September\r\n\n27, the  court had  held a hearing  on arbitrability  pursuant to\r\n\nMatrix's action,  and had  concluded that  the Agent  Agreement's\r                  \r\n\narbitration clause embraced  all disputes.  That decision was not\r                                          \r\n\nenforced  then   because,  virtually   contemporaneously,  Matrix\r\n\ndismissed  its  suit.    Seeking  to  resolve  the  arbitrability\r\n\nquestion,  MCI jumped  in  with  its own  action,  and the  court\r\n\nresponded  on  October  10  by  compelling  arbitration,  thereby\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\neffectively  (though  not  technically) reinstating  its  earlier\r\n\ndecision.4\r\n\n     If  review of that decision  posed only the question whether\r\n\nthe  court properly  interpreted the  Agent  Agreement to  compel\r\n\narbitration   of  the  parties'   dispute,  our  task   would  be\r\n\nstraightforward  and relatively easy.  But several factors affect\r\n\nour analysis,  two of which  complicate the inquiry.   First, the\r\n\ncourt ruled before Matrix had answered MCI's complaint seeking to\r\n\ncompel arbitration, and without a hearing, although Section 4  of\r\n\nthe Federal Arbitration  Act states that \"[t]he  court shall hear\r\n\nthe parties\" before ordering arbitration to proceed.5  The second\r\n\ndifficulty  is   that   Matrix's  appellate   challenge  to   the\r\n\narbitration  clause includes  arguments  that the  district court\r\n\nnever considered, an  omission that typically forecloses  us from\r\n\ntaking them  into account.   See United States v.  Bongiorno, 106\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.3d 1027, 1034 (1st Cir. 1997).   The two problems obviously are\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4 Matrix complains  that the district court  wrongly \"based\"\r\nits October 10 order  on the September 27 order, which had become\r\na  \"nullity\" once  Matrix  dismissed its  suit.   Although  Judge\r\nHarrington's October 10 order stated that it was \"[i]n accordance\r\nwith\" the earlier decision, we take that as a shorthand reference\r\nto the content of that decision -- which he chose not to repeat -\r\n- rather than  as a statement of precedent  governing the October\r\n10 ruling.\r\n\n     5 The relevant portion of the statute states:\r\n\n     The  court shall  hear  the  parties,  and  upon  being\r\n     satisfied  that   the  making  of   the  agreement  for\r\n     arbitration or the  failure to comply therewith  is not\r\n     in  issue, the court shall make  an order directing the\r\n     parties to proceed  to arbitration  in accordance  with\r\n     the terms of the agreement.\r\n\n9 U.S.C.   4.\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nintertwined;  Matrix  logically   points  out  that  it   had  no\r\n\nopportunity to make any arguments to the district  court because,\r                                 \r\n\nin its view, the court ruled prematurely.\r\n\n     The third  factor, somewhat  simplifying our  task, is  that\r\n\nMatrix asserts that it does not challenge any procedural flaws in\r\n\nthe district court's ruling, specifically waiving its  complaints\r\n\nabout the speed of the court's judgment and its failure to hold a\r\n\nhearing.   It maintains  that we  should resolve  \"the underlying\r\n\nissue  of whether  Matrix must arbitrate  its claims  against MCI\r\n\nsince such a determination is largely  a question of law in which\r\n\nno  material facts  are  in dispute.\"   Procedural  errors alone,\r\n\ntherefore, are  waived  as  a basis  for  vacating  the  district\r\n\ncourt's judgment.6\r\n\n     We  address  first the  straightforward  issue: whether  the\r\n\narbitration clause in the Agent Agreement  applies to the present\r\n\nconflict.7    We  think it  does,  finding  unpersuasive Matrix's\r\n\nargument that  the reference to  the Tariff in that  clause meant\r\n\nthat the  Agent Agreement  limited arbitration  only to  customer\r\n\nbilling  disputes in  excess of  $10,000 --  the types  of claims\r\n\nspecifically  arbitrable under  the Tariff.    Like the  district\r\n\ncourt, we think the only sensible  reading is that the Tariff was\r\n\nincorporated  to   provide  a   set  of   procedural  rules   for\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6  In any  event, as  we  discuss infra  at 13-14,  Matrix's\r                                                      \r\nfailure to raise issues before the district court in a motion for\r\nreconsideration bars them on appeal.\r\n\n     7  Our review  on this  question  is de  novo.

New England Power Co., 109 F.3d 46, 50 (1st Cir.\r                                                \r\n1997).\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\narbitrations arising from  the Agent Agreement.  Not  only is the\r\n\nopening language of the arbitration clause in the Agent Agreement\r\n\nbroad  -- \"any\"  dispute relating  to this  agreement  \"shall\" be\r\n\nsubmitted  for  arbitration  --  but   the  limited  construction\r\n\nproposed  by Matrix  would  have the  absurd  result of  entirely\r\n\nnegating the arbitration provision.  Under Matrix's view, because\r\n\nthe  Agreement established an agency relationship between MCI and\r\n\nMatrix, and the Tariff provided  for arbitration only of customer\r                                                                           \r\n\nbilling disputes, no issue arising between the two parties to the\r\n\nAgent Agreement could fall within the arbitration clause.  Matrix\r\n\nexplains this disjunction by arguing that the clause was inserted\r\n\nto specify the dispute resolution procedure for customers brought\r\n\nto  MCI by  Matrix.   We find  this argument  to be  implausible.\r\n\nEither the MCI Tariff would directly govern the customers' claims\r\n\n--  making  reference  to  the  Tariff  in  the  Agent  Agreement\r\n\nunnecessary -- or the customers themselves would have to agree to\r\n\narbitration.\r\n\n     The Tariff language, moreover, reinforces our reading of the\r\n\nAgent Agreement's arbitration provision.  In subsection 7.13, the\r\n\nportion  titled \"Arbitration of disputes,\" see  note 1 supra, the\r                                                                      \r\n\nTariff states  that arbitrations  \"shall be  conducted under  the\r\n\narbitration  rules and procedures  set forth in  Sections B-7.131\r\n\nthrough B-7.139  (Rules),\" which account for more than four pages\r\n\nof text.  Thus, while all of Section B of the Tariff carries  the\r\n\nheading  \"Rules and Regulations,\"  this portion of  Rule 7, which\r\n\ngoverns  arbitration,  makes  another, limited  use  of  the term\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\n\"Rules\"   to   denote   the  specific   provisions   relating  to\r\n\narbitration.  It  is much more reasonable to construe  the use of\r\n\nthe  word \"rules\" in the  Agent Agreement's arbitration clause to\r\n\nrefer to the limited set  of rules concerning arbitration than to\r\n\nall nineteen rules  contained in  Section B  of the  Tariff on  a\r\n\nbroad range of subjects.\r\n\n     In addition, when viewed against the backdrop of the federal\r\n\npolicy favoring arbitration, see, e.g., Volt Info. Sciences, Inc.\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.  Board of Trustees, 489 U.S. 468, 475-76 (1989); Moses H.

But\r                               \r\n\napplying this rule to these circumstances presents something of a\r\n\npuzzle.  Matrix maintains that it cannot be penalized for failing\r\n\nto  assert all  theories because  the district  court gave  it no\r                        \r\n\nopportunity  to offer  any, having  ruled without  a hearing  and\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     9 In fact,  in its Memorandum  in Opposition to  Defendants'\r\nMotion  to Stay  Action  and Compel  Arbitration  (in the  first,\r\nMatrix-filed lawsuit),  Matrix stated:  \"Matrix does not  contend\r\nthat the  parties have  not agreed to  arbitrate pursuant  to the\r\nTariff  Rules,  and  therefore  raises  no  questions  about  the\r\nexistence or validity of the arbitration agreement generally.\"\r\n\n     10  In reviewing the district court's substantive ruling, we\r\nmay not consider materials added to the record in connection with\r\nthe Rule 60(b) motion.   See J. Geils Band  Employee Benefit Plan\r                                                                           \r\nv.  Smith Barney  Shearson, Inc.,  76 F.3d  1245, 1250  (1st Cir.\r                                          \r\n1996).   \r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nbefore  Matrix answered  MCI's  complaint.   Seeking  to avoid  a\r\n\nremand, Matrix  waives any claim  that the court's  procedure was\r\n\nimproper and  contends that  the questions we  face are  legal in\r\n\nnature and thus suitable for resolution by the appellate court.\r\n\n     Although we do not wish to condone precipitous action by the\r\n\ndistrict  court (and the procedural irregularities), we have some\r\n\ndifficulty with Matrix's  position.  First,  while interpretation\r\n\nof the arbitration provision presents a legal question that is as\r\n\nsuitable  for our review as  for the trial  court's, the issue of\r\n\nfraud is decidedly fact-based and thus inappropriately brought to\r\n\nus  first.    We  may  not  assume  the  trial  court's  role  of\r\n\nfactfinder.    In addition,  Matrix's  assertion that  it  had no\r\n\nopportunity to raise the issue of fraud before the district court\r\n\nis at  least somewhat disingenuous.   Only days before  MCI filed\r\n\nits  action,  the  district  court  had held  a  hearing  on  the\r\n\nenforceability of the Agent  Agreement's arbitration provision --\r\n\nwith no suggestion of fraudulent inducement.  Putting to one side\r\n\nthe technical errors,  which Matrix waives, the  court reasonably\r\n\ncould  assume  that   Matrix's  position  with  respect   to  the\r\n\narbitration clause would be the same a week later.\r\n\n     It is theoretically  possible, of course, for Matrix to have\r\n\nchanged  its strategy during  that interim, and  for the district\r\n\ncourt's quick  action thus  to have deprived  Matrix of  its most\r\n\ndirect opportunity to air  the claim of fraud.  If  that were the\r\n\ncase, however, we  would expect Matrix to have  alerted the court\r\n\nto  its  new  position  through  a  motion  for  reconsideration.\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nParticularly when a new theory turns on questions of fact, we are\r\n\ndisinclined to  stray from our longstanding  raise-or-waive rule.\r\n\nIf  Matrix did  not have  the information  within  the post-trial\r\n\nmotion period, its only recourse was through its 60(b) motion. \r\n\n     In short, neglecting to seek reconsideration  meant omission\r\n\nbefore the trial court of the fraud theory upon which Matrix  now\r\n\nwishes to rely.  Although the circumstances here are peculiar, we\r\n\nconclude  that Matrix's \"failure  to move for  reconsideration of\r\n\nthe  district court  order should not  be excused,\"  Vanhaaren v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nState Farm Mut.

We therefore conclude  that Matrix has forfeited  its\r\n\nclaim that  the arbitration clause  should be invalidated  on the\r\n\nbasis of MCI's alleged statements that the arbitration clause did\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\nnot apply to the Agent  Agreement.11  Consequently, we affirm the\r\n\ndistrict court's October 10 judgment compelling arbitration.12\r\n\n     B.

Omission of the hearing required by Section 4 of the\r\nArbitration Act also  could have been  addressed by the  district\r\ncourt   if   brought   to  its   attention   on   a   motion  for\r\nreconsideration, and, even if the issue were not waived, we would\r\nbe inclined to view it as defaulted.\r\n\n     12  Equally unavailing is  Matrix's new contention  that the\r\nAgent  Agreement's  arbitration  clause  is  invalid because  the\r\nTariff  arbitration rules  foreclose remedies,  such as  multiple\r\ndamages, to which it is entitled.   Putting aside the question of\r\nwaiver, this  argument must be brought to  the arbitrator because\r\nit does not go to the arbitrability of the claims but only to the\r\nnature  of available  relief.

As  Matrix posits, if  the MCI/JAMS Agreement\r\nhad been  brought to Judge Harrington's attention,  he would have\r\nhad  to  consider,  in  addition  to  the  contractual  language,\r\n\"whether a reasonable person would  have agreed to an arbitration\r\nprovision  that  called for  JAMS  to handle  the  arbitration of\r\ncertain disputes,  in view  of the MCI/JAMS  Agreement.\"   As our\r\ndiscussion of Matrix's  60(b)(2) claim  demonstrates, see  infra,\r                                                                          \r\naccess to the  MCI/JAMS Agreement would not have added measurably\r\nto  Matrix's   effort   to  invalidate   the  Agent   Agreement's\r\narbitration provision.\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\neven JAMS' general  counsel was unaware of  until this litigation\r\n\ncommenced.14    Second,  Matrix   emphasizes  that  the  MCI/JAMS\r\n\nAgreement reveals an improper relationship involving \"substantial\r\n\nfinancial and reporting ties\" between MCI and JAMS, and it argues\r\n\nthat the Agreement's terms are so obviously suggestive of bias in\r\n\nfavor of MCI that its mere existence is enough to invalidate  the\r\n\ncontested arbitration provision.  \r\n\n     The district court, after a hearing, found Matrix's argument\r\n\nlacking in  several respects.   We may  reject its  judgment only\r\n\nupon finding an abuse of discretion, see Ahmed v. Rosenblatt, 118\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.3d  886, 891  (1st Cir.  1997); Hoult, 57  F.3d at  3.   We are\r                                                 \r\n\nunable to do so.\r\n\n     Judge  Saris initially concluded  that Matrix had  failed to\r\n\nshow that, with  due diligence, it could not  have discovered the\r\n\nevidence earlier.   She pointed out that Matrix  conceded at oral\r\n\nargument  that  corporate   sponsored  arbitration  programs  are\r\n\ncommonplace, and that the MCI  Tariff named JAMS as the company's\r\n\narbitration administrator.   Had Matrix been concerned  about the\r\n\ndetails of the arrangement, she observed, it could have sought to\r\n\ndiscover them.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     14  Although  Matrix  asserts  that  JAMS'  general  counsel\r\n\"professes he  was unaware of  the MCI/JAMS Agreement  until this\r\nlitigation  commenced,\"  the  attorney, Michael  Young,  actually\r\nstated that  he was unfamiliar  with the terms of  the agreement,\r                                                        \r\nnot that he was unaware of any contractual relationship.\r\n\n     Matrix's attorney states that he discovered the agreement in\r\nNovember 1996 as  a result of an offhand remark by an attorney in\r\nan unrelated case.\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\n     Matrix  argues on appeal,  however, that it  was essentially\r\n\nforeclosed  from   conducting  discovery   by  the   sequence  of\r\n\nproceedings in  the  district  court.   In  the  original  Matrix\r\n\nlawsuit,  MCI secured  an extension  of time  to comply  with its\r\n\nobligation  to make the voluntary disclosures required under Fed.\r\n\nR.  Civ.  P. 26,  which  had  the  effect of  holding  off  other\r\n\ndiscovery.     The  court  then  granted  the  motion  to  compel\r\n\narbitration before the extended time  period had expired.  Matrix\r\n\nargues   that  MCI  therefore  managed  to  avoid  producing  any\r\n\ndocuments,  including the undisclosed MCI/JAMS Agreement.  In the\r\n\nsubsequent  MCI  lawsuit,   no  opportunity  for  discovery   was\r\n\npresented  because  the  court's ruling  preceded  any  action by\r                                                                \r\n\nMatrix.\r\n\n     We need  not resolve  whether the  district  court erred  in\r\n\nfinding that Matrix did  not exercise due diligence  with respect\r\n\nto the MCI/JAMS relationship because we conclude, infra, that the\r                                                                 \r\n\nAgreement between them was  not likely to  have had an effect  on\r\n\nJudge Harrington's decision.  Before moving on to the materiality\r\n\ndiscussion, however, we  wish to note that MCI's  failure to make\r\n\nthe Agreement available when it  first was requested from JAMS in\r\n\nNovember 1996 is incomprehensible to us.15   Its refusal to do so\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     15  Matrix  on November  8  requested  that  a copy  of  the\r\nAgreement  be  provided  before  a  meeting  scheduled  with  the\r\narbitrator for November 15.  In a reply sent on November  15, the\r\nJAMS case manager  directed Matrix  to request  the document  via\r\nsubpoena  as  provided  in  the  Tariff  Arbitration  Rules.    A\r\nconference was held on November  22 with counsel for both parties\r\nand  the  arbitrator.   Matrix  again  requested  a copy  of  the\r\nAgreement, but MCI refused to turn it over unless Matrix signed a\r\nstrict confidentiality agreement.  Matrix would not  sign such an\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\nundoubtedly  fueled the already bitter nature of this litigation,\r\n\nand  intensified the  wrangling  over  the Agreement's  contents.\r\n\nMoreover, while the  provisions of the MCI/JAMS agreement are not\r\n\nsufficiently troublesome to warrant the  extraordinary relief for\r\n\nwhich   Rule  60(b)(2)  is  reserved,  they  do  include  matters\r\n\nunquestionably  of interest and concern to parties contracting to\r\n\narbitrate with MCI.   Our judgment should not be taken to condone\r\n\nMCI's nondisclosure.\r\n\n      Even if we  were to conclude that the  district judge erred\r\n\nin  finding a  lack  of diligence,  her  judgment that  \"Matrix's\r\n\nmotion flunks  the materiality test\"  would stand  as a  separate\r\n\nbarrier to relief.  After noting that  the burden is on the party\r\n\npresenting the new evidence to demonstrate that it would probably\r\n\nhave changed the outcome, and that Matrix was not challenging the\r\n\nimpartiality  of the  arbitrator selected  by  JAMS, Judge  Saris\r\n\nconsidered the provisions  of the MCI/JAMS Agreement  that Matrix\r\n\nclaimed were  pivotal.   She found only  one that  caused her  to\r\n\nhesitate in finding  that the Agreement was  entirely immaterial.\r\n\nThat provision precluded  the arbitrator from making  findings of\r\n\nfact  and  conclusions  of  law.   See  App.  at  1190  (MCI/JAMS\r                                                \r\n\nAgreement at  Section XIIE).   Judge  Saris ultimately  concluded\r\n\nthat the provision had no significant effect, and we agree.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nagreement.  On December 10,  the arbitrator entered an order that\r\nall documents exchanged in the arbitration would be confidential,\r\nbut Matrix  did not receive  notice of the  order until the  next\r\nconference with the arbitrator, on January 8, 1997.  The MCI/JAMS\r\nAgreement was given to Matrix at that conference. \r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\n     MCI  is  an  institutional  litigant  and  probably  has  no\r\n\ninterest in  having an arbitrator  spell out  findings and  legal\r\n\nrulings that might  be used against  it in future cases  with its\r\n\ncustomers.  But  there is no reason whatever to think that Matrix\r\n\nwould have  regarded such a  position as material.   Its contract\r\n\ndoes not involve ordinary customer disputes,  and Matrix is fully\r\n\ncapable  of litigating  the  matters  afresh  whether  before  an\r\n\narbitrator or in court.\r\n\n     Indeed,  Matrix' only  explanation as to  why it  might have\r\n\ncared  about the  provision  involves  a  terse  suggestion  that\r\n\narbitrator findings and  conclusions might help Matrix  establish\r\n\nwillfulness, a requirement that Matrix says is necessary to avoid\r\n\na limitation on liability otherwise  imposed by the Tariff.  That\r\n\nlimitation provision is not part of the Tariff arbitration rules,\r\n\nhowever, and is  therefore inapplicable.16   MCI argued that  the\r\n\nliability  limitation is  clearly directed  under  the Tariff  to\r\n\ndelays  and   installation  and  like  matters   involving  MCI's\r\n\nrelations  with its  customers and  has nothing  to do  with this\r\n\ncase,  and Matrix is  visibly silent on  this issue  in its reply\r\n\nbrief.   And,  as it  happens, the arbitrator  in this  case does\r\n\npropose to make findings and conclusions.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     16  We note  that, like  the  arbitration rules  in the  MCI\r\nTariff, the MCI/JAMS  Agreement explicitly states that  it covers\r\nthe arbitration of  customer payment disputes over $10,000.   The\r                                                                    \r\nparties seem to  assume that the Agreement also  applies to other\r\narbitrations administered  by JAMS for  MCI, and we  likewise are\r\npresuming its relevance here. \r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\n     An  additional  factor  reinforces the  conclusion  that the\r\n\nprovision  was  immaterial.    \"It  has  long  been settled  that\r\n\narbitrators are not required to make formal `findings of fact' to\r\n\naccompany the awards they issue.  Indeed,  `[a]rbitrators have no\r\n\nobligation .  . . to  give their reasons  for an award  at all.'\"\r\n\nRaytheon  Co.,  882 F.2d  at  8  (citation  omitted).

See, e.g.,  Prudential-Bache, 72 F.3d  at 239  &amp; n.6;\r                                                  \r\n\nEljer Mfg., Inc. v. Kowin Dev.

We cannot see  how prohibiting a feature  of arbitration\r\n\nthat   was  not  guaranteed   to  begin  with   could  be  deemed\r\n\nsufficiently  material to have  negated a party's  willingness to\r\n\narbitrate.   \r\n\n     Matrix also highlights various payments and \"perks\" that the\r\n\nMCI/JAMS  Agreement requires  to  be furnished  by  MCI to  JAMS,\r\n\nincluding provision of \"[f]ree MCI 800 numbers,\" a \"free MCI Mail\r\n\nAccount,\"   and  \"[t]wo  free  dedicated  phone  lines.\"    These\r\n\nservices, however, are for use  in connection with the tasks JAMS\r\n\nis  required  to  provide under  the  contract  (such as  24-hour\r\n\nelectronic docketing and toll-free response to inquiries from MCI\r\n\ncustomers about arbitration), and we  see nothing sinister in the\r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\ncommunications company contracting to provide the \"tools\" for the\r\n\nwork it  seeks to obtain  from its contractor,  particularly when\r\n\nthose  tools  are  its stock-in-trade.    Likewise,  the payments\r\n\nspecified  in  the  MCI/JAMS  Agreement are  for  services  to be\r\n\nprovided,  plus a $40,000  start-up fee \"to  cover administration\r\n\ndesign, computer services  and technical support\".   See App.  at\r                                                                  \r\n\n1192-95.\r\n\n     Matrix knew from the outset, or should have known, that JAMS\r\n\nhad a substantial  relationship with MCI simply by  virtue of its\r\n\nrole  as  administrator  of MCI's  arbitration  program.   Matrix\r\n\nshould have known as well that the two parties  must have spelled\r\n\nout  their  working  relationship  in  some  form;  we  think  it\r\n\nvirtually inconceivable that  there would be no  written contract\r\n\nbetween them.  Moreover, many of the terms that Matrix  claims to\r\n\nfind shocking in  the MCI/JAMS Agreement  were included in  MCI's\r\n\npublic  request  for  bids  for  a  contract  to  administer  its\r\n\narbitration  program,   meaning  that  those  aspects   of  MCI's\r\n\nrelationship with its arbitration  administrator effectively were\r\n\npublic knowledge when Matrix entered the Agent Agreement.17\r\n\n     With  this much  reasonably  presumed to  be already  on the\r\n\ntable,  we are  unpersuaded that  the district  court  would have\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     17  For example,  the MCI/JAMS  Agreement  requires JAMS  to\r\nprovide weekly reports on the status of current arbitrations, 24-\r\nhour electronic docketing containing any change  in the status of\r\ncases, deadlines  the parties must  meet and  any decisions  that\r\naffect  what the parties  must do, a  centralized case scheduling\r\nsystem,  and an 800 number  to handle inquiries about arbitration\r\nfrom MCI customers.   All of these services were contained in the\r\nbid request.  See App. at 1828-1830.\r                           \r\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\ndeemed  the additional  information  contained  in  the  MCI/JAMS\r\n\nAgreement material  to Matrix's  decision to  participate in  the\r\n\narbitration.  None of the contacts between MCI and JAMS specified\r\n\nin  the  Agreement  involve  the  arbitrators  who  are  deciding\r\n\ncases,18  and Matrix's suggestion that any arbitrator working for\r\n\nJAMS would have  an inherent bias toward MCI,  as JAMS' customer,\r\n\nis  contradicted by Matrix's  explicit assurance that  it did not\r\n\ndoubt the impartiality of the  arbitrator assigned to its case.19\r\n\nWe consequently  hold that the  district court did not  abuse its\r\n\ndiscretion in denying Matrix's Rule 60(b) motion.\r\n\n     In sum, Judge Harrington, as  the appeal is presented to us,\r\n\ncommitted no  reversible error  in issuing  the October 10  order\r\n\ngranting MCI's motion to compel arbitration, and  Judge Saris did\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     18 In fact,  the MCI/JAMS Agreement states  that arbitrators\r\nwill  be  selected based  on,  among other  factors,  \"absence of\r\nconflicts of interest with MCI,\" and \"demonstrated neutrality and\r\nimpartiality in professional practice\".  See Section XII(A).

Appellee MCI Telecommunications Corp. insists that the conflict must be resolved through arbitration, while appellant Matrix Communications Corp. asserts that the arbitration clause in the parties' contract does not apply here, and that it is entitled to a judicial forum for its claims.  The district court sided with MCI--thus ordering arbitration--and then rejected Matrix's motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) to set aside that ruling based on newly discovered evidence.  Matrix appeals both the judgment on the merits and the Rule 60(b) decision.  After close review of the tangled procedural backdrop and the substantive issues, we affirm.I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Little needs to be said about the companies' underlying dispute, which arises from an October 1995 agreement (the \"Agent Agreement\") in which MCI gave Matrix limited agency to sell MCI services.  The Agent Agreement provided for substantial commissions if Matrix generated a specified minimum amount of revenue for MCI.  Matrix alleged, inter alia, that MCI improperly terminated the Agent Agreement eight months later, in June 1996, because Matrix was so successful in obtaining customers that MCI owed it more than one billion dollars in commissions that the corporation did not wish to pay.  MCI countered that termination was proper because Matrix breached the terms of the Agent Agreement in various ways.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following MCI's termination, Matrix filed suit in Massachusetts state court.  MCI removed the action to federal court.  It then moved to stay the litigation and compel arbitration, on the ground that the language of the arbitration clause in the Agent Agreement unambiguously evidenced the parties' intent to arbitrate all disputes arising from that agreement.  The provision, contained in paragraph 22 of the Agent Agreement, states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>Any dispute relating to this Agreement shall be submitted for binding arbitration in accordance with the rules contained in MCI Tariff FCC No. 1 and judgement[sic] on any award entered therein may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Matrix opposed the motion to stay, arguing that, because MCI Tariff FCC No. 1 (\"the Tariff\") expressly limited arbitration to customer billing disputes of $10,000 or more, and Matrix neither was a customer nor had a billing dispute of any amount with MCI, the arbitration clause did not apply to its dispute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Harrington of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts held a hearing on MCI's motion to compel arbitration on September 27, 1996.  Later that day, he signed an order granting the motion, concluding that the arbitration clause unambiguously reflected an intention by the parties to arbitrate all disputes relating to the Agreement.  In his view, the Tariff was referenced not to define the scope of the agreement to arbitrate but to provide the procedural rules under which any arbitration would take place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same day, Matrix filed a notice of voluntary dismissal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(a)(1)(i).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  In a letter to Judge Harrington, Matrix's counsel explained that the company had decided to ask the arbitrator to rule on whether Matrix could receive all the relief it sought through arbitration.  If so, Matrix would consent to continue the arbitration;  if not, Matrix would refile its action in federal court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Harrington dismissed the action.  On September 30, the day both the order compelling arbitration and the grant of dismissal were entered on the docket, Matrix initiated the arbitration by filing a claim with J.A.M.S./Endispute (\"JAMS\"), the arbitration administrator designated by MCI in its Tariff.  Matrix argued to the arbitrator, as it had to the court, that its claims were not arbitrable, and again relied on a reading of the arbitration clause that limited its scope to billing disputes exceeding $10,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MCI responded two days later, on October 2, by filing its own action in federal court seeking to compel arbitration of Matrix's claims.  Although Matrix was at that point participating in arbitration, MCI was concerned that Matrix would not follow through if the arbitrator decided the threshold questions against Matrix's position.  Because of his involvement in the earlier proceeding, Judge Harrington was assigned the MCI action.  Without additional hearings or any responsive pleading from Matrix, he entered an order on October 10 compelling Matrix to arbitrate all of its claims and awarding MCI attorney's fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, the arbitration that Matrix had initiated went forward, and, on December 10, 1996, the arbitrator ruled that Matrix's claims were arbitrable but that certain types of relief sought by Matrix, including multiple damages and attorney's fees, were unavailable in the arbitration because the Tariff barred such remedies.  In February 1997, Matrix filed a motion in district court under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b), seeking relief from the October 10 order.  Matrix contended that MCI had fraudulently induced it to enter into the arbitration clause in the Agent Agreement by concealing an agreement between JAMS and MCI that provided for a close working relationship between the two companies and specified various payments and services to be given by MCI to JAMS.  Matrix argued that the MCI/JAMS Agreement constituted newly discovered evidence of bias on the part of JAMS in favor of MCI.  MCI opposed the motion, filing affidavits and other materials in support of its position that the JAMS Agreement had not been concealed and did not evidence bias on the part either of JAMS, or, more importantly, the arbitrator.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a hearing, District Court Judge Saris denied the Rule 60(b) motion,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> concluding that Matrix had failed to show the elements necessary for post-judgment relief, see Hoult v. Hoult, 57 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir.1995).

Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before discussing the district court's October 10 judgment and its subsequent rejection of Matrix's Rule 60(b) motion, we must address a threshold issue raised by MCI.  It claims that, because Matrix voluntarily submitted the issue of arbitrability to the arbitrator, who then determined that Matrix's claims are arbitrable, Matrix cannot at this juncture challenge the arbitrator's authority to hear the case.  This appeal, MCI contends, is moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have little difficulty in concluding that the appeal should go forward.  From the outset, Matrix explicitly advised the district court that it would return to the courtroom if the arbitrator ruled that Matrix could not obtain all the relief it sought in the arbitral forum.  Although MCI cites language suggesting that Matrix later agreed to arbitrate its claims if the arbitrator ruled that they were arbitrable, we are persuaded that that language was unfairly drawn out of context and that Matrix's actual position has been consistently in opposition to resolving its claims through arbitration unless it were possible to obtain full relief.  Indeed, we think it disingenuous, and bordering on effrontery, for MCI to suggest otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now turn to the issues raised by Matrix on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The October 10 Ruling</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset of our analysis, it is worth recalling the context of the district court's decision on October 10 to compel arbitration.  The motion on which the court ruled was filed by MCI on October 2. Only three working days earlier, on September 27, the court had held a hearing on arbitrability pursuant to Matrix's action, and had concluded that the Agent Agreement's arbitration clause embraced all disputes.  That decision was not enforced then because, virtually contemporaneously, Matrix dismissed its suit.  Seeking to resolve the arbitrability question, MCI jumped in with its own action, and the court responded on October 10 by compelling arbitration, thereby effectively (though not technically) reinstating its earlier decision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If review of that decision posed only the question whether the court properly interpreted the Agent Agreement to compel arbitration of the parties' dispute, our task would be straightforward and relatively easy.  But several factors affect our analysis, two of which complicate the inquiry.  First, the court ruled before Matrix had answered MCI's complaint seeking to compel arbitration, and without a hearing, although Section 4 of the Federal Arbitration Act states that \"[t]he court shall hear the parties\" before ordering arbitration to proceed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The second difficulty is that Matrix's appellate challenge to the arbitration clause includes arguments that the district court never considered, an omission that typically forecloses us from taking them into account.  See United States v. Bongiorno, 106 F.3d 1027, 1034 (1st Cir.1997).  The two problems obviously are intertwined;  Matrix logically points out that it had no opportunity to make any arguments to the district court because, in its view, the court ruled prematurely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third factor, somewhat simplifying our task, is that Matrix asserts that it does not challenge any procedural flaws in the district court's ruling, specifically waiving its complaints about the speed of the court's judgment and its failure to hold a hearing.  It maintains that we should resolve \"the underlying issue of whether Matrix must arbitrate its claims against MCI since such a determination is largely a question of law in which no material facts are in dispute.\"   Procedural errors alone, therefore, are waived as a basis for vacating the district court's judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We address first the straightforward issue:  whether the arbitration clause in the Agent Agreement applies to the present conflict.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  We think it does, finding unpersuasive Matrix's argument that the reference to the Tariff in that clause meant that the Agent Agreement limited arbitration only to customer billing disputes in excess of $10,000--the types of claims specifically arbitrable under the Tariff.  Like the district court, we think the only sensible reading is that the Tariff was incorporated to provide a set of procedural rules for arbitrations arising from the Agent Agreement.  Not only is the opening language of the arbitration clause in the Agent Agreement broad--\"any\" dispute relating to this agreement \"shall\" be submitted for arbitration--but the limited construction proposed by Matrix would have the absurd result of entirely negating the arbitration provision.  Under Matrix's view, because the Agreement established an agency relationship between MCI and Matrix, and the Tariff provided for arbitration only of customer billing disputes, no issue arising between the two parties to the Agent Agreement could fall within the arbitration clause.  Matrix explains this disjunction by arguing that the clause was inserted to specify the dispute resolution procedure for customers brought to MCI by Matrix.  We find this argument to be implausible.  Either the MCI Tariff would directly govern the customers' claims--making reference to the Tariff in the Agent Agreement unnecessary--or the customers themselves would have to agree to arbitration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tariff language, moreover, reinforces our reading of the Agent Agreement's arbitration provision.  In subsection 7.13, the portion titled \"Arbitration of disputes,\" see note 1 supra, the Tariff states that arbitrations \"shall be conducted under the arbitration rules and procedures set forth in Sections B-7.131 through B-7.139 (Rules),\" which account for more than four pages of text.  Thus, while all of Section B of the Tariff carries the heading \"Rules and Regulations,\" this portion of Rule 7, which governs arbitration, makes another, limited use of the term \"Rules\" to denote the specific provisions relating to arbitration.  It is much more reasonable to construe the use of the word \"rules\" in the Agent Agreement's arbitration clause to refer to the limited set of rules concerning arbitration than to all nineteen rules contained in Section B of the Tariff on a broad range of subjects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, when viewed against the backdrop of the federal policy favoring arbitration, see, e.g., Volt Info.  Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees, 489 U.S. 468, 475-76, 109 S.Ct. 1248, 1253-54, 103 L.Ed.2d 488 (1989);  Moses H. Cone Memorial Hosp. v. Mercury Const. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 24-25, 103 S.Ct. 927, 941-42, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> and the generous reading given to broadly worded commercial arbitration agreements, see, e.g., Raytheon Co. v. Automated Bus.  Sys., 882 F.2d 6, 9-11 (1st Cir.1989), the provision here cannot bear the interpretation Matrix seeks to assign to it.  We thus agree with the district court that the arbitration provision contained in paragraph 22 applies to any dispute relating to the Agent Agreement, and that the Tariff was incorporated by reference merely \"to guide an arbitrator as to how he should conduct his hearing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having concluded that paragraph 22 requires arbitration between these parties, we must confront Matrix's assertion that it was duped into accepting the provision by representations from MCI officials that the clause applied only to billing disputes involving customers brought to MCI by Matrix.  Fraud in inducing acceptance of the arbitration clause unquestionably would negate the contractual agreement on that issue.  See generally Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U.S. 395, 403-04 &amp; n. 12, 87 S.Ct. 1801, 1805-06 &amp; n. 12, 18 L.Ed.2d 1270 (1967);  see also Three Valleys Mun. Water Dist. v. E.F. Hutton &amp; Co., 925 F.2d 1136, 1139-40 (9th Cir.1991);  Wick v. Atlantic Marine, Inc., 605 F.2d 166, 168 (5th Cir.1979)(\"[i]f ... the arbitration clause was induced by fraud, there can be no arbitration\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted above, however, Matrix never raised this issue of fraud before the district court,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> a default that implicates our bedrock principle that new arguments may not be made on appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  See Bongiorno, 106 F.3d at 1034;  Lawton v. State Mut. Life Assurance Co. of Am., 101 F.3d 218, 222 (1st Cir.1996).  But applying this rule to these circumstances presents something of a puzzle.  Matrix maintains that it cannot be penalized for failing to assert all theories because the district court gave it no opportunity to offer any, having ruled without a hearing and before Matrix answered MCI's complaint.  Seeking to avoid a remand, Matrix waives any claim that the court's procedure was improper and contends that the questions we face are legal in nature and thus suitable for resolution by the appellate court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we do not wish to condone precipitous action by the district court (and the procedural irregularities), we have some difficulty with Matrix's position.  First, while interpretation of the arbitration provision presents a legal question that is as suitable for our review as for the trial court's, the issue of fraud is decidedly fact-based and thus inappropriately brought to us first.  We may not assume the trial court's role of factfinder.  In addition, Matrix's assertion that it had no opportunity to raise the issue of fraud before the district court is at least somewhat disingenuous.  Only days before MCI filed its action, the district court had held a hearing on the enforceability of the Agent Agreement's arbitration provision--with no suggestion of fraudulent inducement.  Putting to one side the technical errors, which Matrix waives, the court reasonably could assume that Matrix's position with respect to the arbitration clause would be the same a week later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is theoretically possible, of course, for Matrix to have changed its strategy during that interim, and for the district court's quick action thus to have deprived Matrix of its most direct opportunity to air the claim of fraud.  If that were the case, however, we would expect Matrix to have alerted the court to its new position through a motion for reconsideration.  Particularly when a new theory turns on questions of fact, we are disinclined to stray from our longstanding raise-or-waive rule.  If Matrix did not have the information within the post-trial motion period, its only recourse was through its 60(b) motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, neglecting to seek reconsideration meant omission before the trial court of the fraud theory upon which Matrix now wishes to rely.  Although the circumstances here are peculiar, we conclude that Matrix's \"failure to move for reconsideration of the district court order should not be excused,\" VanHaaren v. State Farm Mut. Auto.  Ins. Co., 989 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1993).  Cf. Berkovitz v. Home Box Office, Inc., 89 F.3d 24, 31 (1st Cir.1996) (\"[T]his court from time to time has refused to permit appellants to take advantage of supposed oversights that had not been called to the district court's attention by way of a timeous motion to reconsider.\");  United States v. Schaefer, 87 F.3d 562, 570 n. 9 (1st Cir.1996) (failure to move to reopen the proceedings or for reconsideration undercuts claim of surprise about use of police report in suppression hearing);  Beaulieu v. IRS, 865 F.2d 1351, 1352 (1st Cir.1989) (\"[I]t is a party's first obligation to seek any relief that might fairly have been thought available in the district court before seeking it on appeal.\").  We therefore conclude that Matrix has forfeited its claim that the arbitration clause should be invalidated on the basis of MCI's alleged statements that the arbitration clause did not apply to the Agent Agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Consequently, we affirm the district court's October 10 judgment compelling arbitration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Rule 60(b) Motion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Matrix's effort to undo the October 10 decision via Rule 60(b) rests on the agreement establishing JAMS as the administrator of MCI's arbitration program.  Under Rule 60(b)(2), the district court has discretion to vacate a judgment based upon \"newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b).\"   See Hoult, 57 F.3d at 5-6.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  To prevail, a moving party must demonstrate that \"the missing evidence was 'of such a material and controlling nature as [would] probably [have] change[d] the outcome.' \"  Id. at 6 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Matrix argues that the MCI/JAMS Agreement easily satisfies both the \"newly discovered\" and \"material and controlling\" impact prongs of this standard.  First, it asserts that it had no ability to discover the concealed agreement, which it contends even JAMS' general counsel was unaware of until this litigation commenced.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  Second, Matrix emphasizes that the MCI/JAMS Agreement reveals an improper relationship involving \"substantial financial and reporting ties\" between MCI and JAMS, and it argues that the Agreement's terms are so obviously suggestive of bias in favor of MCI that its mere existence is enough to invalidate the contested arbitration provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, after a hearing, found Matrix's argument lacking in several respects.  We may reject its judgment only upon finding an abuse of discretion, see Ahmed v. Rosenblatt, 118 F.3d 886, 891 (1st Cir.1997);  Hoult, 57 F.3d at 3. We are unable to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Saris initially concluded that Matrix had failed to show that, with due diligence, it could not have discovered the evidence earlier.  She pointed out that Matrix conceded at oral argument that corporate sponsored arbitration programs are commonplace, and that the MCI Tariff named JAMS as the company's arbitration administrator.  Had Matrix been concerned about the details of the arrangement, she observed, it could have sought to discover them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Matrix argues on appeal, however, that it was essentially foreclosed from conducting discovery by the sequence of proceedings in the district court.  In the original Matrix lawsuit, MCI secured an extension of time to comply with its obligation to make the voluntary disclosures required under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26, which had the effect of holding off other discovery.  The court then granted the motion to compel arbitration before the extended time period had expired.  Matrix argues that MCI therefore managed to avoid producing any documents, including the undisclosed MCI/JAMS Agreement.  In the subsequent MCI lawsuit, no opportunity for discovery was presented because the court's ruling preceded any action by Matrix.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not resolve whether the district court erred in finding that Matrix did not exercise due diligence with respect to the MCI/JAMS relationship because we conclude, infra, that the Agreement between them was not likely to have had an effect on Judge Harrington's decision.  Before moving on to the materiality discussion, however, we wish to note that MCI's failure to make the Agreement available when it first was requested from JAMS in November 1996 is incomprehensible to us.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  Its refusal to do so undoubtedly fueled the already bitter nature of this litigation, and intensified the wrangling over the Agreement's contents.  Moreover, while the provisions of the MCI/JAMS agreement are not sufficiently troublesome to warrant the extraordinary relief for which Rule 60(b)(2) is reserved, they do include matters unquestionably of interest and concern to parties contracting to arbitrate with MCI.  Our judgment should not be taken to condone MCI's nondisclosure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we were to conclude that the district judge erred in finding a lack of diligence, her judgment that \"Matrix's motion flunks the materiality test\" would stand as a separate barrier to relief.  After noting that the burden is on the party presenting the new evidence to demonstrate that it would probably have changed the outcome, and that Matrix was not challenging the impartiality of the arbitrator selected by JAMS, Judge Saris considered the provisions of the MCI/JAMS Agreement that Matrix claimed were pivotal.  She found only one that caused her to hesitate in finding that the Agreement was entirely immaterial.  That provision precluded the arbitrator from making findings of fact and conclusions of law.  See App. at 1190 (MCI/JAMS Agreement at Section XIIE).  Judge Saris ultimately concluded that the provision had no significant effect, and we agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MCI is an institutional litigant and probably has no interest in having an arbitrator spell out findings and legal rulings that might be used against it in future cases with its customers.  But there is no reason whatever to think that Matrix would have regarded such a position as material.  Its contract does not involve ordinary customer disputes, and Matrix is fully capable of litigating the matters afresh whether before an arbitrator or in court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, Matrix' only explanation as to why it might have cared about the provision involves a terse suggestion that arbitrator findings and conclusions might help Matrix establish willfulness, a requirement that Matrix says is necessary to avoid a limitation on liability otherwise imposed by the Tariff.  That limitation provision is not part of the Tariff arbitration rules, however, and is therefore inapplicable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  MCI argued that the liability limitation is clearly directed under the Tariff to delays and installation and like matters involving MCI's relations with its customers and has nothing to do with this case, and Matrix is visibly silent on this issue in its reply brief.  And, as it happens, the arbitrator in this case does propose to make findings and conclusions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An additional factor reinforces the conclusion that the provision was immaterial.  \"It has long been settled that arbitrators are not required to make formal 'findings of fact' to accompany the awards they issue.  Indeed, '[a]rbitrators have no obligation ... to give their reasons for an award at all.' \"  Raytheon Co., 882 F.2d at 8 (citation omitted).  See also Prudential-Bache Sec., Inc. v. Tanner, 72 F.3d 234, 240 n. 9 (1st Cir.1995) (\"It is well established that arbitrators are not required to either make formal findings of fact or state reasons for the awards they issue.\")   Moreover, errors in an arbitrator's legal rulings or factual findings do not provide a basis for reversal.  See, e.g., Prudential-Bache, 72 F.3d at 239 &amp; n. 6;  Eljer Mfg., Inc. v. Kowin Dev.  Corp., 14 F.3d 1250, 1253-54 (7th Cir.1994);  Advest, Inc. v. McCarthy, 914 F.2d 6, 8 (1st Cir.1990).  We cannot see how prohibiting a feature of arbitration that was not guaranteed to begin with could be deemed sufficiently material to have negated a party's willingness to arbitrate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Matrix also highlights various payments and \"perks\" that the MCI/JAMS Agreement requires to be furnished by MCI to JAMS, including provision of \"[f]ree MCI 800 numbers,\" a \"free MCI Mail Account,\" and \"[t]wo free dedicated phone lines.\"   These services, however, are for use in connection with the tasks JAMS is required to provide under the contract (such as 24-hour electronic docketing and toll-free response to inquiries from MCI customers about arbitration), and we see nothing sinister in the communications company contracting to provide the \"tools\" for the work it seeks to obtain from its contractor, particularly when those tools are its stock-in-trade.  Likewise, the payments specified in the MCI/JAMS Agreement are for services to be provided, plus a $40,000 start-up fee \"to cover administration design, computer services and technical support\".  See App. at 1192-95.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Matrix knew from the outset, or should have known, that JAMS had a substantial relationship with MCI simply by virtue of its role as administrator of MCI's arbitration program.  Matrix should have known as well that the two parties must have spelled out their working relationship in some form;  we think it virtually inconceivable that there would be no written contract between them.  Moreover, many of the terms that Matrix claims to find shocking in the MCI/JAMS Agreement were included in MCI's public request for bids for a contract to administer its arbitration program, meaning that those aspects of MCI's relationship with its arbitration administrator effectively were public knowledge when Matrix entered the Agent Agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With this much reasonably presumed to be already on the table, we are unpersuaded that the district court would have deemed the additional information contained in the MCI/JAMS Agreement material to Matrix's decision to participate in the arbitration.  None of the contacts between MCI and JAMS specified in the Agreement involve the arbitrators who are deciding cases,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> and Matrix's suggestion that any arbitrator working for JAMS would have an inherent bias toward MCI, as JAMS' customer, is contradicted by Matrix's explicit assurance that it did not doubt the impartiality of the arbitrator assigned to its case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a>  We consequently hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Matrix's Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, Judge Harrington, as the appeal is presented to us, committed no reversible error in issuing the October 10 order granting MCI's motion to compel arbitration, and Judge Saris did not abuse her discretion in rejecting a new trial under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Their judgments accordingly are affirmed.

See Great Western Mortgage Corp. v. Peacock, 110 F.3d 222, 230-31 (3d Cir.1997) (\"Any argument that the provisions of the Arbitration Agreement involve a waiver of substantive rights afforded by the state statute may be presented in the arbitral forum.

The applicable precedent in our circuit is instead that parties may contract to limit remedies in arbitration.  See Raytheon Co. v. Automated Bus.  Sys., 882 F.2d 6, 12 (1st Cir.1989);  see also Mastrobuono v.

See Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc., 862 F.2d 910, 924 (1st Cir.1988) (setting forth the standard applicable to 60(b)(3) claims:  retrial mandated only when the challenged misconduct has \"substantially\" interfered with aggrieved party's ability to fully and fairly prepare for and proceed at trial).  Matrix's reply brief contained no such argument even in the face of MCI's assertion in its brief that the 60(b)(3) claim was waived.  Matrix does argue generally, however, that the district court orders should be vacated because of fraudulent conduct and misrepresentations by MCI.  To the extent that Matrix has not waived a 60(b)(3) claim by failing to brief it fully, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court's rejection of that claim, as we agree with its conclusion that lack of access to the MCI/JAMS Agreement was inconsequential in the proceeding before Judge Harrington.  As Matrix posits, if the MCI/JAMS Agreement had been brought to Judge Harrington's attention, he would have had to consider, in addition to the contractual language, \"whether a reasonable person would have agreed to an arbitration provision that called for JAMS to handle the arbitration of certain disputes, in view of the MCI/JAMS Agreement.\"   As our discussion of Matrix's 60(b)(2) claim demonstrates, see infra, access to the MCI/JAMS Agreement would not have added measurably to Matrix's effort to invalidate the Agent Agreement's arbitration provision</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> Although Matrix asserts that JAMS' general counsel \"professes he was unaware of the MCI/JAMS Agreement until this litigation commenced,\" the attorney, Michael Young, actually stated that he was unfamiliar with the terms of the agreement, not that he was unaware of any contractual relationship</p>\n        <p>Matrix's attorney states that he discovered the agreement in November 1996 as a result of an offhand remark by an attorney in an unrelated case.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> Matrix on November 8 requested that a copy of the Agreement be provided before a meeting scheduled with the arbitrator for November 15.

A conference was held on November 22 with counsel for both parties and the arbitrator.  Matrix again requested a copy of the Agreement, but MCI refused to turn it over unless Matrix signed a strict confidentiality agreement.  Matrix would not sign such an agreement.  On December 10, the arbitrator entered an order that all documents exchanged in the arbitration would be confidential, but Matrix did not receive notice of the order until the next conference with the arbitrator, on January 8, 1997.

Appellee MCI Telecommunications Corp. insists that the conflict must be resolved through arbitration, while appellant Matrix Communications Corp. asserts that the arbitration clause in the parties' contract does not apply here, and that it is entitled to a judicial forum for its claims.  The district court sided with MCI--thus ordering arbitration--and then rejected Matrix's motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) to set aside that ruling based on newly discovered evidence.  Matrix appeals both the judgment on the merits and the Rule 60(b) decision.  After close review of the tangled procedural backdrop and the substantive issues, we affirm.I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Little needs to be said about the companies' underlying dispute, which arises from an October 1995 agreement (the \"Agent Agreement\") in which MCI gave Matrix limited agency to sell MCI services.  The Agent Agreement provided for substantial commissions if Matrix generated a specified minimum amount of revenue for MCI.  Matrix alleged, inter alia, that MCI improperly terminated the Agent Agreement eight months later, in June 1996, because Matrix was so successful in obtaining customers that MCI owed it more than one billion dollars in commissions that the corporation did not wish to pay.  MCI countered that termination was proper because Matrix breached the terms of the Agent Agreement in various ways.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following MCI's termination, Matrix filed suit in Massachusetts state court.  MCI removed the action to federal court.  It then moved to stay the litigation and compel arbitration, on the ground that the language of the arbitration clause in the Agent Agreement unambiguously evidenced the parties' intent to arbitrate all disputes arising from that agreement.  The provision, contained in paragraph 22 of the Agent Agreement, states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>Any dispute relating to this Agreement shall be submitted for binding arbitration in accordance with the rules contained in MCI Tariff FCC No. 1 and judgement[sic] on any award entered therein may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Matrix opposed the motion to stay, arguing that, because MCI Tariff FCC No. 1 (\"the Tariff\") expressly limited arbitration to customer billing disputes of $10,000 or more, and Matrix neither was a customer nor had a billing dispute of any amount with MCI, the arbitration clause did not apply to its dispute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Harrington of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts held a hearing on MCI's motion to compel arbitration on September 27, 1996.  Later that day, he signed an order granting the motion, concluding that the arbitration clause unambiguously reflected an intention by the parties to arbitrate all disputes relating to the Agreement.  In his view, the Tariff was referenced not to define the scope of the agreement to arbitrate but to provide the procedural rules under which any arbitration would take place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same day, Matrix filed a notice of voluntary dismissal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(a)(1)(i).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  In a letter to Judge Harrington, Matrix's counsel explained that the company had decided to ask the arbitrator to rule on whether Matrix could receive all the relief it sought through arbitration.  If so, Matrix would consent to continue the arbitration;  if not, Matrix would refile its action in federal court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Harrington dismissed the action.  On September 30, the day both the order compelling arbitration and the grant of dismissal were entered on the docket, Matrix initiated the arbitration by filing a claim with J.A.M.S./Endispute (\"JAMS\"), the arbitration administrator designated by MCI in its Tariff.  Matrix argued to the arbitrator, as it had to the court, that its claims were not arbitrable, and again relied on a reading of the arbitration clause that limited its scope to billing disputes exceeding $10,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MCI responded two days later, on October 2, by filing its own action in federal court seeking to compel arbitration of Matrix's claims.  Although Matrix was at that point participating in arbitration, MCI was concerned that Matrix would not follow through if the arbitrator decided the threshold questions against Matrix's position.  Because of his involvement in the earlier proceeding, Judge Harrington was assigned the MCI action.  Without additional hearings or any responsive pleading from Matrix, he entered an order on October 10 compelling Matrix to arbitrate all of its claims and awarding MCI attorney's fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, the arbitration that Matrix had initiated went forward, and, on December 10, 1996, the arbitrator ruled that Matrix's claims were arbitrable but that certain types of relief sought by Matrix, including multiple damages and attorney's fees, were unavailable in the arbitration because the Tariff barred such remedies.  In February 1997, Matrix filed a motion in district court under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b), seeking relief from the October 10 order.  Matrix contended that MCI had fraudulently induced it to enter into the arbitration clause in the Agent Agreement by concealing an agreement between JAMS and MCI that provided for a close working relationship between the two companies and specified various payments and services to be given by MCI to JAMS.  Matrix argued that the MCI/JAMS Agreement constituted newly discovered evidence of bias on the part of JAMS in favor of MCI.  MCI opposed the motion, filing affidavits and other materials in support of its position that the JAMS Agreement had not been concealed and did not evidence bias on the part either of JAMS, or, more importantly, the arbitrator.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a hearing, District Court Judge Saris denied the Rule 60(b) motion,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> concluding that Matrix had failed to show the elements necessary for post-judgment relief, see Hoult v.

Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before discussing the district court's October 10 judgment and its subsequent rejection of Matrix's Rule 60(b) motion, we must address a threshold issue raised by MCI.  It claims that, because Matrix voluntarily submitted the issue of arbitrability to the arbitrator, who then determined that Matrix's claims are arbitrable, Matrix cannot at this juncture challenge the arbitrator's authority to hear the case.  This appeal, MCI contends, is moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have little difficulty in concluding that the appeal should go forward.  From the outset, Matrix explicitly advised the district court that it would return to the courtroom if the arbitrator ruled that Matrix could not obtain all the relief it sought in the arbitral forum.  Although MCI cites language suggesting that Matrix later agreed to arbitrate its claims if the arbitrator ruled that they were arbitrable, we are persuaded that that language was unfairly drawn out of context and that Matrix's actual position has been consistently in opposition to resolving its claims through arbitration unless it were possible to obtain full relief.  Indeed, we think it disingenuous, and bordering on effrontery, for MCI to suggest otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now turn to the issues raised by Matrix on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The October 10 Ruling</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset of our analysis, it is worth recalling the context of the district court's decision on October 10 to compel arbitration.  The motion on which the court ruled was filed by MCI on October 2. Only three working days earlier, on September 27, the court had held a hearing on arbitrability pursuant to Matrix's action, and had concluded that the Agent Agreement's arbitration clause embraced all disputes.  That decision was not enforced then because, virtually contemporaneously, Matrix dismissed its suit.  Seeking to resolve the arbitrability question, MCI jumped in with its own action, and the court responded on October 10 by compelling arbitration, thereby effectively (though not technically) reinstating its earlier decision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If review of that decision posed only the question whether the court properly interpreted the Agent Agreement to compel arbitration of the parties' dispute, our task would be straightforward and relatively easy.  But several factors affect our analysis, two of which complicate the inquiry.  First, the court ruled before Matrix had answered MCI's complaint seeking to compel arbitration, and without a hearing, although Section 4 of the Federal Arbitration Act states that \"[t]he court shall hear the parties\" before ordering arbitration to proceed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The second difficulty is that Matrix's appellate challenge to the arbitration clause includes arguments that the district court never considered, an omission that typically forecloses us from taking them into account.

Bongiorno, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"735399\"><a href=\"/opinion/735399/united-states-v-frank-p-bongiorno-united-states-of-america-v-frank-p/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1027</span></a></span>, 1034 (1st Cir.1997).  The two problems obviously are intertwined;  Matrix logically points out that it had no opportunity to make any arguments to the district court because, in its view, the court ruled prematurely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third factor, somewhat simplifying our task, is that Matrix asserts that it does not challenge any procedural flaws in the district court's ruling, specifically waiving its complaints about the speed of the court's judgment and its failure to hold a hearing.  It maintains that we should resolve \"the underlying issue of whether Matrix must arbitrate its claims against MCI since such a determination is largely a question of law in which no material facts are in dispute.\"   Procedural errors alone, therefore, are waived as a basis for vacating the district court's judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We address first the straightforward issue:  whether the arbitration clause in the Agent Agreement applies to the present conflict.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  We think it does, finding unpersuasive Matrix's argument that the reference to the Tariff in that clause meant that the Agent Agreement limited arbitration only to customer billing disputes in excess of $10,000--the types of claims specifically arbitrable under the Tariff.  Like the district court, we think the only sensible reading is that the Tariff was incorporated to provide a set of procedural rules for arbitrations arising from the Agent Agreement.  Not only is the opening language of the arbitration clause in the Agent Agreement broad--\"any\" dispute relating to this agreement \"shall\" be submitted for arbitration--but the limited construction proposed by Matrix would have the absurd result of entirely negating the arbitration provision.  Under Matrix's view, because the Agreement established an agency relationship between MCI and Matrix, and the Tariff provided for arbitration only of customer billing disputes, no issue arising between the two parties to the Agent Agreement could fall within the arbitration clause.  Matrix explains this disjunction by arguing that the clause was inserted to specify the dispute resolution procedure for customers brought to MCI by Matrix.  We find this argument to be implausible.  Either the MCI Tariff would directly govern the customers' claims--making reference to the Tariff in the Agent Agreement unnecessary--or the customers themselves would have to agree to arbitration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tariff language, moreover, reinforces our reading of the Agent Agreement's arbitration provision.  In subsection 7.13, the portion titled \"Arbitration of disputes,\" see note 1 supra, the Tariff states that arbitrations \"shall be conducted under the arbitration rules and procedures set forth in Sections B-7.131 through B-7.139 (Rules),\" which account for more than four pages of text.  Thus, while all of Section B of the Tariff carries the heading \"Rules and Regulations,\" this portion of Rule 7, which governs arbitration, makes another, limited use of the term \"Rules\" to denote the specific provisions relating to arbitration.  It is much more reasonable to construe the use of the word \"rules\" in the Agent Agreement's arbitration clause to refer to the limited set of rules concerning arbitration than to all nineteen rules contained in Section B of the Tariff on a broad range of subjects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, when viewed against the backdrop of the federal policy favoring arbitration, see, e.g., Volt Info.

State Mut.

But applying this rule to these circumstances presents something of a puzzle.  Matrix maintains that it cannot be penalized for failing to assert all theories because the district court gave it no opportunity to offer any, having ruled without a hearing and before Matrix answered MCI's complaint.  Seeking to avoid a remand, Matrix waives any claim that the court's procedure was improper and contends that the questions we face are legal in nature and thus suitable for resolution by the appellate court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we do not wish to condone precipitous action by the district court (and the procedural irregularities), we have some difficulty with Matrix's position.  First, while interpretation of the arbitration provision presents a legal question that is as suitable for our review as for the trial court's, the issue of fraud is decidedly fact-based and thus inappropriately brought to us first.  We may not assume the trial court's role of factfinder.  In addition, Matrix's assertion that it had no opportunity to raise the issue of fraud before the district court is at least somewhat disingenuous.  Only days before MCI filed its action, the district court had held a hearing on the enforceability of the Agent Agreement's arbitration provision--with no suggestion of fraudulent inducement.  Putting to one side the technical errors, which Matrix waives, the court reasonably could assume that Matrix's position with respect to the arbitration clause would be the same a week later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is theoretically possible, of course, for Matrix to have changed its strategy during that interim, and for the district court's quick action thus to have deprived Matrix of its most direct opportunity to air the claim of fraud.  If that were the case, however, we would expect Matrix to have alerted the court to its new position through a motion for reconsideration.  Particularly when a new theory turns on questions of fact, we are disinclined to stray from our longstanding raise-or-waive rule.  If Matrix did not have the information within the post-trial motion period, its only recourse was through its 60(b) motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, neglecting to seek reconsideration meant omission before the trial court of the fraud theory upon which Matrix now wishes to rely.  Although the circumstances here are peculiar, we conclude that Matrix's \"failure to move for reconsideration of the district court order should not be excused,\" VanHaaren v. State Farm Mut. Auto.

We therefore conclude that Matrix has forfeited its claim that the arbitration clause should be invalidated on the basis of MCI's alleged statements that the arbitration clause did not apply to the Agent Agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Consequently, we affirm the district court's October 10 judgment compelling arbitration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Rule 60(b) Motion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Matrix's effort to undo the October 10 decision via Rule 60(b) rests on the agreement establishing JAMS as the administrator of MCI's arbitration program.  Under Rule 60(b)(2), the district court has discretion to vacate a judgment based upon \"newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b).\"   See Hoult, 57 F.3d at 5-6.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  To prevail, a moving party must demonstrate that \"the missing evidence was 'of such a material and controlling nature as [would] probably [have] change[d] the outcome.' \"  Id. at 6 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Matrix argues that the MCI/JAMS Agreement easily satisfies both the \"newly discovered\" and \"material and controlling\" impact prongs of this standard.  First, it asserts that it had no ability to discover the concealed agreement, which it contends even JAMS' general counsel was unaware of until this litigation commenced.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  Second, Matrix emphasizes that the MCI/JAMS Agreement reveals an improper relationship involving \"substantial financial and reporting ties\" between MCI and JAMS, and it argues that the Agreement's terms are so obviously suggestive of bias in favor of MCI that its mere existence is enough to invalidate the contested arbitration provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, after a hearing, found Matrix's argument lacking in several respects.  We may reject its judgment only upon finding an abuse of discretion, see Ahmed v. Rosenblatt, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197458\"><a href=\"/opinion/197458/ahmed-v-rosenblatt/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">886</span></a></span>, 891 (1st Cir.1997);  Hoult, 57 F.3d at 3. We are unable to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Saris initially concluded that Matrix had failed to show that, with due diligence, it could not have discovered the evidence earlier.  She pointed out that Matrix conceded at oral argument that corporate sponsored arbitration programs are commonplace, and that the MCI Tariff named JAMS as the company's arbitration administrator.  Had Matrix been concerned about the details of the arrangement, she observed, it could have sought to discover them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Matrix argues on appeal, however, that it was essentially foreclosed from conducting discovery by the sequence of proceedings in the district court.  In the original Matrix lawsuit, MCI secured an extension of time to comply with its obligation to make the voluntary disclosures required under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26, which had the effect of holding off other discovery.  The court then granted the motion to compel arbitration before the extended time period had expired.  Matrix argues that MCI therefore managed to avoid producing any documents, including the undisclosed MCI/JAMS Agreement.  In the subsequent MCI lawsuit, no opportunity for discovery was presented because the court's ruling preceded any action by Matrix.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not resolve whether the district court erred in finding that Matrix did not exercise due diligence with respect to the MCI/JAMS relationship because we conclude, infra, that the Agreement between them was not likely to have had an effect on Judge Harrington's decision.  Before moving on to the materiality discussion, however, we wish to note that MCI's failure to make the Agreement available when it first was requested from JAMS in November 1996 is incomprehensible to us.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  Its refusal to do so undoubtedly fueled the already bitter nature of this litigation, and intensified the wrangling over the Agreement's contents.  Moreover, while the provisions of the MCI/JAMS agreement are not sufficiently troublesome to warrant the extraordinary relief for which Rule 60(b)(2) is reserved, they do include matters unquestionably of interest and concern to parties contracting to arbitrate with MCI.  Our judgment should not be taken to condone MCI's nondisclosure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we were to conclude that the district judge erred in finding a lack of diligence, her judgment that \"Matrix's motion flunks the materiality test\" would stand as a separate barrier to relief.  After noting that the burden is on the party presenting the new evidence to demonstrate that it would probably have changed the outcome, and that Matrix was not challenging the impartiality of the arbitrator selected by JAMS, Judge Saris considered the provisions of the MCI/JAMS Agreement that Matrix claimed were pivotal.  She found only one that caused her to hesitate in finding that the Agreement was entirely immaterial.  That provision precluded the arbitrator from making findings of fact and conclusions of law.  See App. at 1190 (MCI/JAMS Agreement at Section XIIE).  Judge Saris ultimately concluded that the provision had no significant effect, and we agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MCI is an institutional litigant and probably has no interest in having an arbitrator spell out findings and legal rulings that might be used against it in future cases with its customers.  But there is no reason whatever to think that Matrix would have regarded such a position as material.  Its contract does not involve ordinary customer disputes, and Matrix is fully capable of litigating the matters afresh whether before an arbitrator or in court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, Matrix' only explanation as to why it might have cared about the provision involves a terse suggestion that arbitrator findings and conclusions might help Matrix establish willfulness, a requirement that Matrix says is necessary to avoid a limitation on liability otherwise imposed by the Tariff.  That limitation provision is not part of the Tariff arbitration rules, however, and is therefore inapplicable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  MCI argued that the liability limitation is clearly directed under the Tariff to delays and installation and like matters involving MCI's relations with its customers and has nothing to do with this case, and Matrix is visibly silent on this issue in its reply brief.  And, as it happens, the arbitrator in this case does propose to make findings and conclusions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An additional factor reinforces the conclusion that the provision was immaterial.  \"It has long been settled that arbitrators are not required to make formal 'findings of fact' to accompany the awards they issue.

We cannot see how prohibiting a feature of arbitration that was not guaranteed to begin with could be deemed sufficiently material to have negated a party's willingness to arbitrate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Matrix also highlights various payments and \"perks\" that the MCI/JAMS Agreement requires to be furnished by MCI to JAMS, including provision of \"[f]ree MCI 800 numbers,\" a \"free MCI Mail Account,\" and \"[t]wo free dedicated phone lines.\"   These services, however, are for use in connection with the tasks JAMS is required to provide under the contract (such as 24-hour electronic docketing and toll-free response to inquiries from MCI customers about arbitration), and we see nothing sinister in the communications company contracting to provide the \"tools\" for the work it seeks to obtain from its contractor, particularly when those tools are its stock-in-trade.  Likewise, the payments specified in the MCI/JAMS Agreement are for services to be provided, plus a $40,000 start-up fee \"to cover administration design, computer services and technical support\".  See App. at 1192-95.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Matrix knew from the outset, or should have known, that JAMS had a substantial relationship with MCI simply by virtue of its role as administrator of MCI's arbitration program.  Matrix should have known as well that the two parties must have spelled out their working relationship in some form;  we think it virtually inconceivable that there would be no written contract between them.  Moreover, many of the terms that Matrix claims to find shocking in the MCI/JAMS Agreement were included in MCI's public request for bids for a contract to administer its arbitration program, meaning that those aspects of MCI's relationship with its arbitration administrator effectively were public knowledge when Matrix entered the Agent Agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With this much reasonably presumed to be already on the table, we are unpersuaded that the district court would have deemed the additional information contained in the MCI/JAMS Agreement material to Matrix's decision to participate in the arbitration.  None of the contacts between MCI and JAMS specified in the Agreement involve the arbitrators who are deciding cases,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> and Matrix's suggestion that any arbitrator working for JAMS would have an inherent bias toward MCI, as JAMS' customer, is contradicted by Matrix's explicit assurance that it did not doubt the impartiality of the arbitrator assigned to its case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a>  We consequently hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Matrix's Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, Judge Harrington, as the appeal is presented to us, committed no reversible error in issuing the October 10 order granting MCI's motion to compel arbitration, and Judge Saris did not abuse her discretion in rejecting a new trial under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Their judgments accordingly are affirmed.

Section .1327, for example, requires the Responding Party to file a written answer within 17 days after the arbitration commences;  section .133 directs the case manager to hold an administrative conference within nine days of the arbitration's commencement;  under section .1341, the appointed arbitrator may be removed only for bias or \"other good cause\";  section .135 provides for an exchange of documents and other information within 23 days after the arbitration commences;  and section .1391 provides for the privacy of all arbitration conferences and hearings.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Although Judge Harrington may have ruled before Matrix filed for dismissal, it appears that Matrix did not learn of the ruling until later, and believed at the time it filed that the decision would not be made for several days</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The case had been reassigned to Judge Saris subsequent to Judge Harrington's October 10, 1996 order</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Matrix complains that the district court wrongly \"based\" its October 10 order on the September 27 order, which had become a \"nullity\" once Matrix dismissed its suit.

Putting aside the question of waiver, this argument must be brought to the arbitrator because it does not go to the arbitrability of the claims but only to the nature of available relief.

The applicable precedent in our circuit is instead that parties may contract to limit remedies in arbitration.  See Raytheon Co. v. Automated Bus.

See Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"515444\"><a href=\"/opinion/515444/anne-anderson-v-cryovac-inc-anne-anderson-v-beatrice-foods-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">862</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">910</span></a></span>, 924 (1st Cir.1988) (setting forth the standard applicable to 60(b)(3) claims:  retrial mandated only when the challenged misconduct has \"substantially\" interfered with aggrieved party's ability to fully and fairly prepare for and proceed at trial).  Matrix's reply brief contained no such argument even in the face of MCI's assertion in its brief that the 60(b)(3) claim was waived.  Matrix does argue generally, however, that the district court orders should be vacated because of fraudulent conduct and misrepresentations by MCI.  To the extent that Matrix has not waived a 60(b)(3) claim by failing to brief it fully, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court's rejection of that claim, as we agree with its conclusion that lack of access to the MCI/JAMS Agreement was inconsequential in the proceeding before Judge Harrington.  As Matrix posits, if the MCI/JAMS Agreement had been brought to Judge Harrington's attention, he would have had to consider, in addition to the contractual language, \"whether a reasonable person would have agreed to an arbitration provision that called for JAMS to handle the arbitration of certain disputes, in view of the MCI/JAMS Agreement.\"   As our discussion of Matrix's 60(b)(2) claim demonstrates, see infra, access to the MCI/JAMS Agreement would not have added measurably to Matrix's effort to invalidate the Agent Agreement's arbitration provision</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> Although Matrix asserts that JAMS' general counsel \"professes he was unaware of the MCI/JAMS Agreement until this litigation commenced,\" the attorney, Michael Young, actually stated that he was unfamiliar with the terms of the agreement, not that he was unaware of any contractual relationship</p>\n        <p>Matrix's attorney states that he discovered the agreement in November 1996 as a result of an offhand remark by an attorney in an unrelated case.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> Matrix on November 8 requested that a copy of the Agreement be provided before a meeting scheduled with the arbitrator for November 15.  In a reply sent on November 15, the JAMS case manager directed Matrix to request the document via subpoena as provided in the Tariff Arbitration Rules.  A conference was held on November 22 with counsel for both parties and the arbitrator.  Matrix again requested a copy of the Agreement, but MCI refused to turn it over unless Matrix signed a strict confidentiality agreement.  Matrix would not sign such an agreement.  On December 10, the arbitrator entered an order that all documents exchanged in the arbitration would be confidential, but Matrix did not receive notice of the order until the next conference with the arbitrator, on January 8, 1997.  The MCI/JAMS Agreement was given to Matrix at that conference</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> We note that, like the arbitration rules in the MCI Tariff, the MCI/JAMS Agreement explicitly states that it covers the arbitration of customer payment disputes over $10,000.   The parties seem to assume that the Agreement also applies to other arbitrations administered by JAMS for MCI, and we likewise are presuming its relevance here</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> For example, the MCI/JAMS Agreement requires JAMS to provide weekly reports on the status of current arbitrations, 24-hour electronic docketing containing any change in the status of cases, deadlines the parties must meet and any decisions that affect what the parties must do, a centralized case scheduling system, and an 800 number to handle inquiries about arbitration from MCI customers.  All of these services were contained in the bid request.  See App. at 1828-1830</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> In fact, the MCI/JAMS Agreement states that arbitrators will be selected based on, among other factors, \"absence of conflicts of interest with MCI,\" and \"demonstrated neutrality and impartiality in professional practice\".  See Section XII(A).  The Agreement also provides:</p>\n        <p>ENDISPUTE will ensure that arbitrators serving on the MCI panel have been screened for potential conflicts of interest with MCI prior to inclusion on the panel.  When appointed to a particular proceeding, arbitrators will be required to disclose any conflicts of interest with MCI which may have developed during the interim since the arbitrator's inclusion on the panel.  In addition, arbitrators will be screened prior to appointment to a particular arbitration for potential conflicts with the MCI customer who is a party to the case.</p>\n        <p>Id. at (C).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn19\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19_ref\">19</a>\n        <p> The arbitrator is the Honorable Robert L.
