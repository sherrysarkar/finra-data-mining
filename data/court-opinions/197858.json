Lewis, Assistant Regional Counsel,\r\nSocial Security Administration, on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                                         \r\n                       March 18, 1998\r\n\n                                         \r\n  Per Curiam.  Claimant Maria Santiago appeals a district\r\ncourt judgment that affirmed a decision by the Commissioner of\r\nSocial Security denying claimant's application for disability\r\nbenefits.  We have thoroughly reviewed the record and the\r\nparties' briefs on appeal.  We conclude that the Commissioner's\r\ndecision is supported by substantial evidence and uninfected by\r\nlegal error.  We add the following comments.\r\n    1.  Claimant asserts, without citation to the record or\r\ncase law, that she proved that she is unable to perform her\r\npast relevant work as a housekeeper.  We disagree.  The record\r\ndiscloses that this work required claimant to perform only\r\nsimple, routine tasks for up to 4-5 hours, and that both of the\r\nCommissioner's consulting psychologists found claimant's\r\nability to perform such tasks was not significantly limited. \r\nAlthough claimant was represented by counsel at her\r\nadministrative hearing, she never explained how her impairments\r\nprevented her from performing her past work.  Thus, she failed\r\nto meet her burden at step four.  See, e.g., Santiago v.\r\nSecretary of Health and Human Services, 944 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir.\r\n1991)(per curiam); Gray v. Heckler, 790 F.2d 369, 372, 375 (1st\r\nCir. 1985)(per curiam);  Gonzalez Perez v. Secretary of Health\r\nand Human Services, 572 F2d 886, 888 (1st Cir. 1978).        \r\n    2.  Claimant next says that the administrative law judge\r\n(ALJ) should have evaluated her mental impairment under the\r\nlisting for Somatoform Disorders (12.07), not under the\r\nlisting for Affective Disorders (12.04).  She maintains that\r\nthe ALJ applied the wrong listing and, in so doing, \r\nimpermissibly substituted his own lay opinion on the nature of\r\nclaimant's mental impairment for the opinion of his medical\r\nadvisor, Dr. Perez Arzola.  Claimant errs on both counts.   Dr.\r\nPerez Arzola's testimony in no way established the presence of\r\na somatoform disorder, and there was ample evidence to support\r\nthe ALJ's use of the listing governing affective disorders. \r\n    3.  Vocational expert testimony was not required where\r\nclaimant failed to meet her burden at step four and the\r\nCommissioner procured expert assessments of claimant's residual\r\nfunctional capacity.  \r\n    Claimant's remaining contentions on appeal are meritless. \r\n  Affirmed.\r\n",
