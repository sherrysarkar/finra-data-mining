This case has its origin in a law\n\nsuit   against     the    auto    manufacturer      DaimlerChrysler         Motors\n\nCorporation (\"DaimlerChrysler\") by Seacoast Motors of Salisbury\n\n(\"Seacoast\"),      one    of     its   dealers.       Seacoast     claims     that\n\nDaimlerChrysler's decision to authorize a new competing dealer\n\nnear Salisbury was an arbitrary and unfair trade practice under\n\nMass. Gen. Laws. ch. 93B, § 4(3)(l) (West 1997).                   The district\n\ncourt dismissed Seacoast's suit and ordered arbitration pursuant\n\nto a clause in Seacoast's dealership agreement that, both sides\n\nconcede, covered the claim.            Seacoast Motors of Salisbury, Inc.\n\nv. Chrysler Corp., 959 F. Supp. 52, 56 (D. Mass. 1997).\n\n            Seacoast appealed to this court, arguing that its\n\nchapter   93B    claim    sounded      in     antitrust   and    was   thus    not\n\narbitrable under the so-called American Safety doctrine.                       See\n\nAm. Safety Equip. Corp. v. J.P. Maguire & Co., 391 F.2d 821,\n\n827-28 (2d Cir. 1968).           This court, on a ground later rejected\n\nby the Supreme Court in another case, Green Tree Fin. Corp. v.\n\nRandolph,    531   U.S.    79,     88-89    (2000),   held      that   it   lacked\n\njurisdiction over Seacoast's appeal because the arbitrability\n\ndecision was \"embedded\" in the underlying substantive dispute\n\nand thus interlocutory.            Seacoast, 143 F.3d 626, 628-29 (1st\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 965 (1998).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f         Thereafter,      Seacoast's    claim   was    submitted     to\n\narbitration    and   DaimlerChrysler   prevailed.      Seacoast    then\n\nrepeated its objection to arbitrability in a new federal suit,\n\nbrought in the same district court that had ordered arbitration,\n\nseeking to enjoin enforcement of the arbitration award.            The\n\ndistrict court once again dismissed, this time without a written\n\nopinion, and Seacoast now appeals.     We review the issue de novo.\n\nRosa v. Park West Bank & Trust Co., 214 F.3d 213, 215 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).\n\n         At the threshold, there is uncertainty whether Seacoast\n\nhas a timely cause of action in this case.            DaimlerChrysler\n\nargues that Seacoast's challenge to the arbitration award is a\n\nsuit to vacate the arbitration award under section 10 of the\n\nFederal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"), 9 U.S.C. § 10 (1994).         If so,\n\nSeacoast's claim is time-barred, because it failed to serve\n\nnotice of the action on DaimlerChrysler within three months of\n\nthe filing of the award (its service came six days late).             9\n\nU.S.C. § 12.    Seacoast's reply is that this is not a motion to\n\nvacate under section 10 but an independent equitable action to\n\nenjoin the award not subject to section 12's time limit.\n\n         Section 10 sets forth a restricted list of grounds on\n\nwhich a court may entertain a motion to vacate an award; those\n\ngrounds are directed primarily to fundamental errors within the\n\n\n                                -4-\n\farbitration process itself (e.g., fraud, misconduct) and, read\n\nliterally, they may not include the anterior claim that the\n\narbitration contract is itself invalid.               Although section 12's\n\nthree-month statute of limitations is not formally limited to\n\nmotions to vacate \"under section 10,\" such motions were surely\n\nwhat the drafters of the FAA had principally in mind.\n\n            Of   course,     the   existence    of    a    valid    arbitration\n\ncontract embracing the dispute is the predicate for everything\n\nelse.     Section 10 omits any reference to disagreements on this\n\nissue as a ground for attacking an award; but this is probably\n\nbecause    the   drafters     assumed    that   any       party    who    resisted\n\narbitration would do so at the outset.               If so, the issue would\n\nbe   presented    to   the    trial     court   on    a    motion    to    compel\n\narbitration, either by a de novo motion (9 U.S.C. § 4) or in\n\nresisting a civil suit by an adversary (9 U.S.C. § 3), and\n\nresolved prior to arbitration.\n\n            Here, Seacoast brought a civil suit and did contest\n\narbitrability; but when the district court held the matter\n\nsubject to arbitration, it dismissed the case instead of staying\n\nthe civil action.      As already described, we in turn dismissed an\n\nimmediate appeal on the ground that the judgment was not final\n\nand the Supreme Court then denied certiorari (even though it\n\nlater held that such judgments are final).                The question, then,\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fis what vehicle is available for Seacoast to get appellate\n\nreview now of its original claim that the dispute was not\n\narbitrable.\n\n           One way is to read section 10, stretching its language,\n\nto include any adequately preserved ground ( e.g., public policy)\n\non which an arbitration award might be challenged--over and\n\nabove those specifically listed in section 10.              Alternatively,\n\none might imagine some form of independent equitable action.\n\nThere is limited precedent for both courses, and both have\n\ndifficulties.1 But even if an independent action were permitted,\n\nsection 12 might still be read as a three-month time limit on\n\nattacks   on   arbitration   awards    subject   to   the    FAA,   however\n\nframed.\n\n           These puzzles need not be resolved here and should be\n\nleft for cases where they have to be decided.               The procedural\n\ngap in the FAA that ensnared Seacoast has been closed by Green\n\nTree: in the future, the party in Seacoast's position will be\n\nable to appeal the order of dismissal it suffered as a \"final\"\n\norder (and will at least risk a claim of waiver or law of the\n\ncase if it does not).    And where the district court finds that\n\n\n     1See Advest, Inc. v. McCarthy, 914 F.2d 6, 8-9 (1st               Cir.\n1990); Societe Generale de Surveillance, S.A. v. Raytheon              Eur.\nMgmt. & Sys. Co., 643 F.2d 863, 867-68 (1st Cir. 1981); see            also\n4 MacNeil, Speidel & Stipanowich, Federal Arbitration Law §            40.5\n(1999); 2 id. § 23.5.\n\n                                 -6-\n\farbitration is required and enters a stay of the action before\n\nit,    the   arbitrability     issue      it    decided   will   be   adequately\n\npreserved for appellate review when the stay is ended and the\n\ndistrict court later proceeds with enforcement.\n\n             We turn then to the merits, assuming                 arguendo that\n\nSeacoast has brought a timely challenge to the arbitrability\n\nruling.      There is no \"jurisdictional\" bar to our approach:                the\n\nparties are diverse and there is clearly a constitutional case\n\nor controversy.         See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't,\n\n523 U.S. 83, 93-95 (1998).          We conclude that even assuming that\n\nSeacoast's claim is properly before the court and not out of\n\ntime, Seacoast still loses.\n\n             Seacoast argues that its claim under chapter 93B sounds\n\nin    antitrust   and    is   therefore        nonarbitrable     under   American\n\nSafety.      The provision of chapter 93B that gives rise to the\n\nsuit is typical of so-called auto dealer protection statutes\n\npassed by many states since the 1960s.                     See   generally ABA\n\nAntitrust Section, Monograph No. 17, Franchise Protection: Laws\n\nAgainst      Termination      and   the        Establishment     of   Additional\n\nFranchises (1990).        Massachusetts' version prohibits inter alia\n\nauto manufacturers from \"arbitrarily\" granting a franchise to a\n\ndealer who intends to sell the same line of cars in the same\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fretail market area as an existing franchisee.                    Mass. Gen. Laws.\n\nch. 93B, § 4(3)(l).\n\n            To describe such a chapter 93B claim as \"antitrust\" is\n\na   very   dubious       use   of   language.       The   central    aim    of   the\n\nantitrust laws is to protect consumers against certain abusive\n\nbusiness practices--especially price-fixing and monopoly.                        See\n\n1 Areeda & Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 100a (2000).                   By contrast,\n\ndealer     protection      statutes,    so    far    as   they    allow    existing\n\ndealers to block new ones, are commonly aimed at restricting\n\nintrabrand competition (i.e., among dealers selling the same\n\nproduct).     See Heritage Jeep-Eagle, Inc. v. Chrysler Corp., 655\n\nN.E.2d 140, 143-44 (Mass. App. Ct. 1995).                 Such restrictions are\n\nnot   normally      pro-consumer,       and,     where    imposed     by    dealers\n\nthemselves     as    a    naked     restraint,      can   readily    violate     the\n\nantitrust laws.          United States v. Topco Assocs., 405 U.S. 596,\n\n608 (1972).2\n\n            Insofar as such statutes protect against arbitrary\n\nousters of existing dealers (e.g., by a refusal to renew a\n\nfranchise), Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 93B, § 4(3)(e), they may in\n\n\n\n      2\n     In some situations, a supplier like DaimlerChrysler may\nlawfully impose such restrictions (e.g., granting exclusive\nterritories) to protect dealer services against \"free riding\" or\nto promote dealer investment, Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE\nSylvania,  Inc.,   433   U.S.  36,   54-55   (1977);  but   here\nDaimlerChrysler seeks to expand dealer competition.\n\n                                        -8-\n\fprinciple     serve   to    protect     a   small        business     from    being\n\nmistreated by a large one.        But even there, the aim is often one\n\nof fairness, not promotion of competition.                  See Beard Motors,\n\nInc. v. Toyota Motor Distribs., Inc., 480 N.E.2d 303, 306 (Mass.\n\n1985).     Antitrust law protects competition, not competitors.\n\nBrown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 320 (1962).                        In\n\nall events, nothing in Seacoast's complaint has to do with a\n\nthreatened dealer cut-off; Seacoast simply does not want to face\n\na new competitor.\n\n            Even if we assumed arguendo that Seacoast's claim could\n\nbe classified as an antitrust claim, it remains arbitrable.\n\nSeacoast argues that the Massachusetts legislature made chapter\n\n93B claims nonarbitrable in 1977 when it deleted a provision\n\nthat automatically required arbitration absent clear agreement\n\nto the contrary.      The inference that the 1977 change meant to\n\npreclude     arbitration     is   doubtful        and,     in   any    event,     is\n\nirrelevant.       Because    of   the    FAA's     preemptive         effect,    the\n\nquestion    is   solely    whether      federal    law     or   policy       exempts\n\nantitrust claims from the pro-arbitration presumption of the\n\nFAA.     Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U.S. 1, 10-11 (1984).\n\n            To this, Seacoast urges a positive answer based on\n\nAmerican Safety, in which the Second Circuit held that antitrust\n\nclaims are not arbitrable because of \"the pervasive public\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\finterest in enforcement of the antitrust laws.\"                 391 F.2d at\n\n827-28.    This circuit once adopted           American Safety, but the\n\nSupreme Court reversed, at least in the context of antitrust\n\nclaims arising from international transactions.                  Mitsubishi\n\nMotors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, 723 F.2d 155, 169 (1st\n\nCir. 1983), rev'd, 473 U.S. 614, 629 (1985).\n\n           Since   then,    several   circuits        have   abandoned    the\n\nAmerican Safety doctrine in its entirety.               See, e.g., Kotam\n\nElecs., Inc. v. JBL Consumer Prods., Inc., 93 F.3d 724, 725-28\n\n(11th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1110 (1997); Nghiem v.\n\nNEC Elec., Inc., 25 F.3d 1437, 1442 (9th Cir.), cert. denied,\n\n513 U.S. 1044 (1994).       Others have expressed doubt whether it\n\nremains good law.       See, e.g., Sanjuan v. Am. Bd. of Psychiatry\n\n& Neurology, Inc., 40 F.3d 247, 250 (7th Cir. 1994),                     cert.\n\ndenied 516 U.S. 1159 (1996); Swensen's Ice Cream Co. v. Corsair\n\nCorp., 942 F.2d 1307, 1310 (8th Cir. 1991).             It is time to lay\n\nit to rest.\n\n           American Safety rested on the basic premise that the\n\npublic interest in antitrust enforcement, the complexity of the\n\nantitrust laws, and the inadequacy of arbitral tribunals make\n\narbitration of private antitrust claims inappropriate.                   This\n\npremise   has   since   been   rejected   by    the   Supreme   Court     with\n\nrespect to a variety of other statutory claims no less important\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\for complex.       See Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500\n\nU.S. 20 (1991) (Age Discrimination in Employment Act); Rodriguez\n\nde Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490                          U.S.    477\n\n(1989) (1933 Securities Act); Shearson/American Express Inc. v.\n\nMcMahon, 482 U.S. 220 (1987) (1934 Securities Act and civil\n\nRICO).3\n\n              There is no question here of an advance waiver of\n\nantitrust        claims;    arbitration        clauses      do     not     eliminate\n\nsubstantive       rights    but    submit      them   for   resolution        in   an\n\narbitral, rather than a judicial forum.               Mitsubishi, 473 U.S. at\n\n628.       And while some antitrust cases do involve large issues in\n\nwhich      the   public    has    an   interest,      others     are     essentially\n\nbusiness quarrels peculiar to the parties.                       For those in the\n\nformer category, government agencies remain free to pursue the\n\ndefendant regardless of private actions, whether before courts\n\nor arbitrators.       We think time has passed by the American Safety\n\ndoctrine and so hold.\n\n              Affirmed.\n\n\n\n       3\n      In Page v. Moseley, Hallgarten, Estabrook & Weeden, Inc.,\n806 F.2d 291 (1st Cir. 1986), this court stated that the Supreme\nCourt’s decision in Mitsubishi did not overrule the American\nSafety doctrine where the context was domestic rather than\ninternational, and on this basis, Page held that civil RICO\nclaims were not arbitrable. Id. at 299. But Page's holding was\nitself abrogated by the Supreme Court in Shearson/American\nExpress, 482 U.S. at 225.\n\n                                        -11-\n\f",

If so, Seacoast's claim is time-barred, because it failed to serve notice of the action on DaimlerChrysler within three months of the filing of the award (its service came six days late). 9 U.S.C. &#167; 12. Seacoast's reply is that this is not a motion to vacate under section 10 but an independent equitable action to enjoin the award not subject to section 12's time limit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 10 sets forth a restricted list of grounds on which a court may entertain a motion to vacate an award; those grounds are directed primarily to fundamental errors within the arbitration process itself (e.g., fraud, misconduct) and, read literally, they may not include the anterior claim that the arbitration contract is itself invalid. Although section 12's three-month statute of limitations is not formally limited to motions to vacate \"under section 10,\" such motions were surely what the drafters of the FAA had principally in mind.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the existence of a valid arbitration contract embracing the dispute is the predicate for everything else. Section 10 omits any reference to disagreements on this issue as a ground for attacking an award; but this is probably because the drafters assumed that any party who resisted arbitration would do so at the outset. If so, the issue would be presented to the trial court on a motion to compel arbitration, either by a de novo motion (9 U.S.C. &#167; 4) or in resisting a civil suit by an adversary (9 U.S.C. &#167; 3), and resolved prior to arbitration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Seacoast brought a civil suit and did contest arbitrability; but when the district court held the matter subject to arbitration, it dismissed the case instead of staying the civil action. As already described, we in turn dismissed an immediate appeal on the ground that the judgment was not final and the Supreme Court then denied certiorari (even though it later held that such judgments are final). The question, then, is what vehicle is available for Seacoast to get appellate review now of its original claim that the dispute was not arbitrable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One way is to read section 10, stretching its language, to include any adequately preserved ground (e.g., public policy) on which an arbitration award might be challenged--over and above those specifically listed in section 10. Alternatively, one might imagine some form of independent equitable action. There is limited precedent for both courses, and both have difficulties.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> But even if an independent action were permitted, section 12 might still be read as a three-month time limit on attacks on arbitration awards subject to the FAA, however framed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These puzzles need not be resolved here and should be left for cases where they have to be decided. The procedural gap in the FAA that ensnared Seacoast has been closed by Green Tree: in the future, the party in Seacoast's position will be able to appeal the order of dismissal it suffered as a \"final\" order (and will at least risk a claim of waiver or law of the case if it does not). And where the district court finds that arbitration is required and enters a stay of the action before it, the arbitrability issue it decided will be adequately preserved for appellate review when the stay is ended and the district court later proceeds with enforcement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn then to the merits, assuming arguendo that Seacoast has brought a timely challenge to the arbitrability ruling. There is no \"jurisdictional\" bar to our approach: the parties are diverse and there is clearly a constitutional case or controversy. See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't, 523 U.S. 83, 93-95 (1998). We conclude that even assuming that Seacoast's claim is properly before the court and not out of time, Seacoast still loses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seacoast argues that its claim under chapter 93B sounds in antitrust and is therefore nonarbitrable under American Safety. The provision of chapter 93B that gives rise to the suit is typical of so-called auto dealer protection statutes passed by many states since the 1960s. See generally ABA Antitrust Section, Monograph No. 17, Franchise Protection: Laws Against Termination and the Establishment of Additional Franchises (1990). Massachusetts' version prohibits inter alia auto manufacturers from \"arbitrarily\" granting a franchise to a dealer who intends to sell the same line of cars in the same retail market area as an existing franchisee. Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 93B, &#167; 4(3)(l).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To describe such a chapter 93B claim as \"antitrust\" is a very dubious use of language. The central aim of the antitrust laws is to protect consumers against certain abusive business practices--especially price-fixing and monopoly. See 1 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law &#182; 100a (2000). By contrast, dealer protection statutes, so far as they allow existing dealers to block new ones, are commonly aimed at restricting intrabrand competition (i.e., among dealers selling the same product). See Heritage Jeep-Eagle, Inc. v. Chrysler Corp., 655 N.E.2d 140, 143-44 (Mass. App. Ct. 1995). Such restrictions are not normally pro-consumer, and, where imposed by dealers themselves as a naked restraint, can readily violate the antitrust laws. United States v. Topco Assocs., 405 U.S. 596, 608 (1972).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Insofar as such statutes protect against arbitrary ousters of existing dealers (e.g., by a refusal to renew a franchise), Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 93B, &#167; 4(3)(e), they may in principle serve to protect a small business from being mistreated by a large one. But even there, the aim is often one of fairness, not promotion of competition. See Beard Motors, Inc. v. Toyota Motor Distribs., Inc., 480 N.E.2d 303, 306 (Mass. 1985). Antitrust law protects competition, not competitors. Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 320 (1962). In all events, nothing in Seacoast's complaint has to do with a threatened dealer cut-off; Seacoast simply does not want to face a new competitor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we assumed arguendo that Seacoast's claim could be classified as an antitrust claim, it remains arbitrable. Seacoast argues that the Massachusetts legislature made chapter 93B claims nonarbitrable in 1977 when it deleted a provision that automatically required arbitration absent clear agreement to the contrary. The inference that the 1977 change meant to preclude arbitration is doubtful and, in any event, is irrelevant. Because of the FAA's preemptive effect, the question is solely whether federal law or policy exempts antitrust claims from the pro-arbitration presumption of the FAA. Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U.S. 1, 10-11 (1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To this, Seacoast urges a positive answer based on American Safety, in which the Second Circuit held that antitrust claims are not arbitrable because of \"the pervasive public interest in enforcement of the antitrust laws.\" 391 F.2d at 827-28. This circuit once adopted American Safety, but the Supreme Court reversed, at least in the context of antitrust claims arising from international transactions. Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, 723 F.2d 155, 169 (1st Cir. 1983), rev'd, 473 U.S. 614, 629 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since then, several circuits have abandoned the American Safety doctrine in its entirety. See, e.g., Kotam Elecs., Inc. v. JBL Consumer Prods., Inc., 93 F.3d 724, 725-28 (11th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1110 (1997); Nghiem v. NEC Elec., Inc., 25 F.3d 1437, 1442 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1044 (1994). Others have expressed doubt whether it remains good law. See, e.g., Sanjuan v. Am. Bd. of Psychiatry &amp; Neurology, Inc., 40 F.3d 247, 250 (7th Cir. 1994), cert. denied 516 U.S. 1159 (1996); Swensen's Ice Cream Co. v. Corsair Corp., 942 F.2d 1307, 1310 (8th Cir. 1991). It is time to lay it to rest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">American Safety rested on the basic premise that the public interest in antitrust enforcement, the complexity of the antitrust laws, and the inadequacy of arbitral tribunals make arbitration of private antitrust claims inappropriate. This premise has since been rejected by the Supreme Court with respect to a variety of other statutory claims no less important or complex. See Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U.S. 20 (1991) (Age Discrimination in Employment Act); Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U.S. 477 (1989) (1933 Securities Act); Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon, 482 U.S. 220 (1987) (1934 Securities Act and civil RICO).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no question here of an advance waiver of antitrust claims; arbitration clauses do not eliminate substantive rights but submit them for resolution in an arbitral, rather than a judicial forum. Mitsubishi, 473 U.S. at 628. And while some antitrust cases do involve large issues in which the public has an interest, others are essentially business quarrels peculiar to the parties. For those in the former category, government agencies remain free to pursue the defendant regardless of private actions, whether before courts or arbitrators.

This premise has since been rejected by the Supreme Court with respect to a variety of other statutory claims no less important or complex. See Gilmer v.

Mitsubishi, 473 U.S. at 628. And while some antitrust cases do involve large issues in which the public has an interest, others are essentially business quarrels peculiar to the parties. For those in the former category, government agencies remain free to pursue the defendant regardless of private actions, whether before courts or arbitrators.
