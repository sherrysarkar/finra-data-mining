The Resolution Trust Corporation\r\n(\"RTC\"), the receiver of a failed bank, filed this action to\r\nrecover under a promissory note which was executed and delivered\r\nby defendant Roger K. Kane, Jr., (\"Kane\") as trustee of Northern\r\nSpy Realty Trust, to the bank.  The other defendants in this case\r\nguaranteed payment on the note.  Kane counterclaimed against the\r\nRTC, seeking reliance damages under the Financial Institutions\r\nReform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (\"FIRREA\").  The\r\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\"), as the statutory\r\nsuccessor to the RTC in this action, moved for partial summary\r\n           judgment as to the counterclaim.\r\n     In a memorandum and order, the district court dismissed Kane's\r\ncounterclaim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because he\r\nhad failed to exhaust his administrative remedies under FIRREA. \r\nThe Reliant Group, Ltd. (\"Reliant\"), to whom the FDIC had\r\nassigned the promissory note during the course of the litigation,\r\nthen moved for entry of judgment, and the district court entered\r\njudgment against Kane in the amount of $4,261,370.65 plus\r\ninterest and attorney's fees.  Finding that Kane's claim for\r\ndamages is barred by his failure to participate in the\r\nadministrative claims review process mandated by FIRREA, we\r\n   affirm the district court's order and judgment.\r\n                    I.  BACKGROUND\r\n     The following facts are essentially undisputed.  In 1989, Kane,\r\nas trustee of Northern Spy Realty Trust, obtained a $3.8 million\r\nloan from Home Owners Savings Bank F.S.B. (the \"Bank\") to finance\r\nthe construction of a golf course and clubhouse in Townsend,\r\nMassachusetts.  The other defendants in this action, Kane,\r\nindividually, and two entities he controlled, Roger K. Kane, Jr.\r\nReal Estate Trust and Northern Spy Country Club, Inc., guaranteed\r\nthe loan.  The loan agreement provided that Kane would submit\r\nspecific construction requisitions to draw down on the loan. \r\nUpon the Bank's approval of these requisitions, it would advance\r\nloan proceeds, up to the maximum amount authorized.  Under this\r\narrangement, the Bank advanced approximately $2.4 million.\r\nOn April 27, 1990, the RTC was appointed conservator of the Bank. \r\nAs of that date, there was an outstanding construction\r\nrequisition in the amount of $61,650, against which the Bank had\r\nadvanced $37,800.  Neither the Bank nor the RTC completed the\r\nfunding of this requisition.  After the RTC became conservator,\r\nKane did not submit any further requisitions, and the RTC did not\r\nmake any further advances under the loan.  After May 1990, Kane\r\ndid not make any payment of interest due under the promissory\r\nnotes.\r\nOn September 7, 1990, the RTC was appointed receiver of the Bank. \r\nIt published notice of the administrative claims review process\r\nand established December 11, 1990, as the \"bar date\" for the\r\nfiling of claims against the Bank or the RTC as receiver.  \r\nOn August 19, 1994, the RTC filed this action to recover under\r\nthe promissory note and guaranties.  The mortgaged real estate\r\nwas subsequently sold and the proceeds turned over to the RTC,\r\nbut a deficiency remains.  Kane counterclaimed against the RTC,\r\nseeking damages under FIRREA for the RTC's alleged repudiation of\r\nthe loan agreement.  Both Kane and the FDIC, the statutory\r\nsuccessor to the RTC in this action, moved for summary judgment\r\non the counterclaim.  The FDIC asserted, inter alia, that the\r\ndistrict court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because Kane\r\nhad failed to submit his claim to the RTC for administrative\r\nconsideration within the statutory period prescribed by FIRREA. \r\nOn this basis, the district court granted summary judgment in\r\nfavor of the FDIC.\r\nSubsequently, the district court entered judgment against Kane in\r\nfavor of the assignee of the promissory note, Reliant, in the\r\namount of $4,261,370.65 plus interest and attorney's fees.  Kane\r\nappeals.  The only issue raised by appellant is whether his\r\nfailure to exhaust his administrative remedies under FIRREA bars\r\nhis counterclaim for damages.\r\nII.  DISCUSSION\r\nWe review de novo a district court's grant of summary judgment. \r\nSee Bethlehem Steel Export Corp. v. Redondo Constr. Corp., 140\r\nF.3d 319, 320 (1st Cir. 1998).\r\nUnder FIRREA, persons having claims against the assets of a\r\nfailed financial institution are subject to the administrative\r\nclaims review process prescribed by 12 U.S.C.  1821(d).  Under\r\n1821(d)(3)(B) and (C), the FDIC (or RTC), as receiver of the\r\nbank, must publish and mail notice of liquidation to any persons\r\nappearing as creditors on the institution's books and allow at\r\nleast ninety days for filing of claims.  See 12 U.S.C.\r\n1821(d)(3)(B), (C).  Claimants must submit any administrative\r\nclaims to the receiver by the date specified in the published\r\nnotice, which we will refer to as the bar date.  See 12 U.S.C.\r\n1821(d)(3)(B)(i) (late-submitted claims \"shall be disallowed\r\nand such disallowance shall be final\").\r\n\"FIRREA makes participation in the administrative claims review\r\nprocess mandatory for all parties asserting claims against failed\r\ninstitutions . . . .\"  Marquis v. FDIC, 965 F.2d 1148, 1151 (1st\r\nCir. 1992).  The failure to participate in the administrative\r\nprocess constitutes a failure to exhaust one's administrative\r\nremedies, and thus, is a bar to judicial review.  See id.; see\r\nalso Heno v. FDIC, 20 F.3d 1204, 1207 (1st Cir. 1994).  However,\r\nin certain limited circumstances, claims submitted after the bar\r\ndate  are not subject to this jurisdictional bar.  Late-submitted\r\nclaims are not automatically denied under  1821(d)(5)(C)(i), if\r\ntwo conditions are satisfied:\r\n     [F]irst, 'the claimant did not receive notice of the appointment\r\n     of the receiver in time to file such claim before such date,' and\r\n     second, the claim is filed 'in time to permit payment of such\r\n     claim.'\r\n\nReliant Group, Ltd. v. Kane, No. 94-11681, slip op. at 5 (D.\r\nMass. April 21, 1997) (citing 12 U.S.C.  1821(d)(5)(C)(ii)(I),\r\n(II)).  This court has recognized that the FDIC's interpretation\r\nof this statutory exception \"permit[s] late filing even by\r\nclaimants who were on notice of FDIC's appointment but could not\r\nfile their claim because it did not come into existence until\r\nafter the bar date. . . .\"  Heno, 20 F.3d at 1209.\r\nThe receiver established December 11, 1990, as the relevant bar\r\ndate.  It is undisputed that Kane did not file an administrative\r\nclaim prior to the bar date.  However, Kane avers that his claim\r\nfor damages as a result of the RTC's alleged repudiation of the\r\nloan agreement did not accrue before December 11, 1990.  He\r\nargues that he falls within the exception for late-submitted\r\nclaims because his claim arose after that date.  Specifically,\r\nKane asserts that the RTC constructively repudiated the loan\r\nagreement after the bar date by failing to make any further\r\nadvances to him under the loan, and by not affirmatively giving\r\nhim adequate assurances of its performance.  Having repudiated\r\nthe loan, the RTC should have then discovered that Kane was a\r\npotential claimant, and in accordance with its internal\r\nprocedures, should have provided Kane with notice of his\r\nopportunity to present his claim through the administrative\r\nprocess.  Since the RTC never provided such notice, Kane contends\r\nthat he was not required to submit his claim for administrative\r\nconsideration prior to his counterclaim in this suit.\r\nWe hold that Kane's claim accrued prior to the bar date.  Thus,\r\nhis failure to submit such a claim to the administrative claims\r\nreview process precludes judicial review.  \"It is generally\r\nstated that a claim 'first accrues' when all the events have\r\noccurred which fix the alleged liability of the defendant and\r\nentitle the plaintiff to institute an action . . . and the\r\nplaintiff was or should have been aware of their existence.\"  SeeHopland Band of Pomo Indians v. United States, 855 F.2d 1573,\r\n1577 (Fed. Cir. 1988).\r\nAccording to Kane's own counterclaim, he incurred damages when\r\nthe RTC failed to lend him any additional money under the loan\r\nagreement, which in turn, left him unable to complete the golf\r\ncourse.  As of April 27, 1990, the date the RTC was appointed\r\nconservator of the Bank, the Bank had advanced only $37,800 on a\r\nconstruction requisition in the amount of $61,650.  Kane\r\nacknowledges that neither the Bank nor the RTC completed funding\r\nthis outstanding requisition, and that he did not submit any\r\nother requisitions after this date.  As a result, Kane failed to\r\nmeet an August 1990 opening date for the golf course.  In\r\ndeposition testimony, Roger Kane himself conceded that the Bank's\r\nbreach of the loan agreement occurred prior to May 9, 1990.  In\r\nresponse to repeated questions whether the Bank was in breach\r\nprior to that date, he responded \"yes\" or \"absolutely yes.\" \r\nAccordingly, we find that the event fixing the defendant's\r\nalleged liability, i.e., the RTC's failure to honor Kane's\r\nconstruction requisition, occurred on or shortly after the RTC's\r\nappointment as conservator.\r\nNothing in the record suggests that the RTC's appointment as\r\nreceiver in early September 1990 extinguished this cause of\r\naction.  For instance, the receiver neither continued funding\r\nunder the loan agreement nor promised Kane that it would do so. \r\nThus, Kane's claim was subject to FIRREA's administrative claims\r\nprocedure.  He was aware of his claim before the Bank entered\r\nreceivership, and knew that he had at least three months from the\r\ntime of the RTC's appointment as receiver to assert it for\r\nadministrative consideration.  Kane's failure to exhaust his\r\nadministrative remedies bars this action.\r\nHaving determined that Kane's claim accrued prior to the bar\r\ndate, we need not address whether the RTC constructively\r\nrepudiated the loan agreement after that date.\r\nIII.  CONCLUSION    \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's\r\ndisposition of this action.\n",

Kane counterclaimed against the RTC, seeking reliance damages under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (\"FIRREA\").

Finding that Kane's claim for damages is barred by his failure to participate in the administrative claims review process mandated by FIRREA, we affirm the district court's order and judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following facts are essentially undisputed.  In 1989, Kane, as trustee of Northern Spy Realty Trust, obtained a $3.8 million loan from Home Owners Savings Bank F.S.B.  (the \"Bank\") to finance the construction of a golf course and clubhouse in Townsend, Massachusetts.  The other defendants in this action, Kane, individually, and two entities he controlled, Roger K. Kane, Jr. Real Estate Trust and Northern Spy Country Club, Inc., guaranteed the loan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The loan agreement provided that Kane would submit specific construction requisitions to draw down on the loan.  Upon the Bank's approval of these requisitions, it would advance loan proceeds, up to the maximum amount authorized.  Under this arrangement, the Bank advanced approximately $2.4 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 27, 1990, the RTC was appointed conservator of the Bank.  As of that date, there was an outstanding construction requisition in the amount of $61,650, against which the Bank had advanced $37,800.  Neither the Bank nor the RTC completed the funding of this requisition.  After the RTC became conservator, Kane did not submit any further requisitions, and the RTC did not make any further advances under the loan.  After May 1990, Kane did not make any payment of interest due under the promissory notes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 7, 1990, the RTC was appointed receiver of the Bank.  It published notice of the administrative claims review process and established December 11, 1990, as the \"bar date\" for the filing of claims against the Bank or the RTC as receiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 19, 1994, the RTC filed this action to recover under the promissory note and guaranties.  The mortgaged real estate was subsequently sold and the proceeds turned over to the RTC, but a deficiency remains.  Kane counterclaimed against the RTC, seeking damages under FIRREA for the RTC's alleged repudiation of the loan agreement.  Both Kane and the FDIC, the statutory successor to the RTC in this action, moved for summary judgment on the counterclaim.  The FDIC asserted, inter alia, that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because Kane had failed to submit his claim to the RTC for administrative consideration within the statutory period prescribed by FIRREA.  On this basis, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the FDIC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, the district court entered judgment against Kane in favor of the assignee of the promissory note, Reliant, in the amount of $4,261,370.65 plus interest and attorney's fees.  Kane appeals.  The only issue raised by appellant is whether his failure to exhaust his administrative remedies under FIRREA bars his counterclaim for damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review de novo a district court's grant of summary judgment.  See Bethlehem Steel Export Corp. v. Redondo Constr.  Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197891\"><a href=\"/opinion/197891/bethlehem-v-redondo/\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span>, 320 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under FIRREA, persons having claims against the assets of a failed financial institution are subject to the administrative claims review process prescribed by 12 U.S.C. &#167; 1821(d).  Under &#167; 1821(d)(3)(B) and (C), the FDIC (or RTC), as receiver of the bank, must publish and mail notice of liquidation to any persons appearing as creditors on the institution's books and allow at least ninety days for filing of claims.  See 12 U.S.C. &#167; 1821(d)(3)(B), (C).  Claimants must submit any administrative claims to the receiver by the date specified in the published notice, which we will refer to as the bar date.  See 12 U.S.C. &#167; 1821(d)(3)(B)(i) (late-submitted claims \"shall be disallowed and such disallowance shall be final\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"FIRREA makes participation in the administrative claims review process mandatory for all parties asserting claims against failed institutions....\"  Marquis v. FDIC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584142\"><a href=\"/opinion/584142/serge-marquis-v-federal-deposit-insurance-corporation-as-liquidating/\"><span class=\"volume\">965</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1148</span></a></span>, 1151 (1st Cir.1992).  The failure to participate in the administrative process constitutes a failure to exhaust one's administrative remedies, and thus, is a bar to judicial review.  See id.;   see also Heno v. FDIC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"667150\"><a href=\"/opinion/667150/floyd-v-heno-v-federal-deposit-insurance-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1204</span></a></span>, 1207 (1st Cir.1994).  However, in certain limited circumstances, claims submitted after the bar date are not subject to this jurisdictional bar.  Late-submitted claims are not automatically denied under &#167; 1821(d)(5)(C)(i), if two conditions are satisfied:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>[F]irst, 'the claimant did not receive notice of the appointment of the receiver in time to file such claim before such date,' and second, the claim is filed 'in time to permit payment of such claim.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reliant Group, Ltd. v. Kane, No. 94-11681, slip op. at 5 (D. Mass.  April 21, 1997) (citing 12 U.S.C. &#167; 1821(d)(5)(C)(ii)(I), (II)).  This court has recognized that the FDIC's interpretation of this statutory exception \"permit[s] late filing even by claimants who were on notice of FDIC's appointment but could not file their claim because it did not come into existence until after the bar date....\"  Heno, 20 F.3d at 1209.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The receiver established December 11, 1990, as the relevant bar date.  It is undisputed that Kane did not file an administrative claim prior to the bar date.  However, Kane avers that his claim for damages as a result of the RTC's alleged repudiation of the loan agreement did not accrue before December 11, 1990.  He argues that he falls within the exception for late-submitted claims because his claim arose after that date.  Specifically, Kane asserts that the RTC constructively repudiated the loan agreement after the bar date by failing to make any further advances to him under the loan, and by not affirmatively giving him adequate assurances of its performance.  Having repudiated the loan, the RTC should have then discovered that Kane was a potential claimant, and in accordance with its internal procedures, should have provided Kane with notice of his opportunity to present his claim through the administrative process.  Since the RTC never provided such notice, Kane contends that he was not required to submit his claim for administrative consideration prior to his counterclaim in this suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that Kane's claim accrued prior to the bar date.  Thus, his failure to submit such a claim to the administrative claims review process precludes judicial review.  \"It is generally stated that a claim 'first accrues' when all the events have occurred which fix the alleged liability of the defendant and entitle the plaintiff to institute an action ... and the plaintiff was or should have been aware of their existence.\"   See Hopland Band of Pomo Indians v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"511016\"><a href=\"/opinion/511016/hopland-band-of-pomo-indians-v-the-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">855</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1573</span></a></span>, 1577 (Fed.Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Kane's own counterclaim, he incurred damages when the RTC failed to lend him any additional money under the loan agreement, which in turn, left him unable to complete the golf course.  As of April 27, 1990, the date the RTC was appointed conservator of the Bank, the Bank had advanced only $37,800 on a construction requisition in the amount of $61,650.  Kane acknowledges that neither the Bank nor the RTC completed funding this outstanding requisition, and that he did not submit any other requisitions after this date.  As a result, Kane failed to meet an August 1990 opening date for the golf course.  In deposition testimony, Roger Kane himself conceded that the Bank's breach of the loan agreement occurred prior to May 9, 1990.  In response to repeated questions whether the Bank was in breach prior to that date, he responded \"yes\" or \"absolutely yes.\"   Accordingly, we find that the event fixing the defendant's alleged liability, i.e., the RTC's failure to honor Kane's construction requisition, occurred on or shortly after the RTC's appointment as conservator.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the record suggests that the RTC's appointment as receiver in early September 1990 extinguished this cause of action.  For instance, the receiver neither continued funding under the loan agreement nor promised Kane that it would do so.  Thus, Kane's claim was subject to FIRREA's administrative claims procedure.  He was aware of his claim before the Bank entered receivership, and knew that he had at least three months from the time of the RTC's appointment as receiver to assert it for administrative consideration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Kane's failure to exhaust his administrative remedies bars this action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having determined that Kane's claim accrued prior to the bar date, we need not address whether the RTC constructively repudiated the loan agreement after that date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's disposition of this action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Hereinafter, \"Kane\" will denote all defendants in this action</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Kane does not allege that he lacked notice of either the RTC's appointment as receiver or of the upcoming December 11, 1990 bar date.
