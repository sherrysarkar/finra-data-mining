Second, petitioner contests the EPA's May 1995 approval\r\n\nof  a revised  State Implementation  Plan (\"SIP\")  issued by  the\r\n\nCommonwealth of Puerto  Rico, which banned  further use of  clam-\r\n\nshell devices in grain removal operations to ensure attainment of\r\n\nthe NAAQS  PM10 standard prescribed  for Guaynabo.   We  conclude\r\n\nthat the first claim  is time-barred and reject the  second claim\r\n\non the merits. \r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r                                                \r\n\n          The  CAA  was  enacted  \"to  protect  and  enhance  the\r\n\nNation's  air  quality, to  initiate  and  accelerate a  national\r\n\nprogram  of  research and  development  designed  to control  air\r\n\npollution, to  provide technical and financial  assistance to the\r\n\nStates in  the execution  of pollution  control programs,  and to\r\n\nencourage  the  development  of regional  pollution  control pro-\r\n\ngrams.\" Conservation  Law Found.,  Inc. v.

In\r\n\nfurtherance of these objectives, the EPA promulgated NAAQS, which\r\n\nprescribe, inter alia, maximum allowable concentration  levels of\r                               \r\n\nfine particulate matter with  an aerodynamic diameter not greater\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nthan  a  nominal  ten micrometers  (\"PM10\").

Accordingly, each\r                                             \r\n\nState, as  well  as the  Commonwealth  of Puerto  Rico  (\"Common-\r\n\nwealth\"),  is required  to submit  for EPA  approval a  SIP which\r\n\nspecifies  the manner  in which  compliance with  NAAQS is  to be\r\n\nachieved.

A region  that has not attained compliance with  NAAQS is\r\n\ndesignated a \"nonattainment\" area, see 42 U.S.C.   7407(d)(1)(A),\r                                                \r\n\nwhich  imposes  upon the  State  the obligation  to  include more\r\n\nstringent provisions in its SIP.

See id.    7407(d)(4)(B), 7513(a); 56 Fed. Reg. 11,105.\r                           \r\n\nAccordingly, on March 15,  1991, the EPA published notice  in the\r\n\nFederal Register announcing  its initial designation  of Guaynabo\r                          \r\n\nas a  \"moderate\" nonattainment  area for PM10.   See 42  U.S.C.  \r                                                              \r\n\n7502(a)(1)  (permitting EPA  to \"classify\"  nonattainment areas).\r\n\nOn November 6, 1991,  the EPA issued  a final rule codifying  its\r\n\nPM10  nonattainment   designation  for  Guaynabo.     See  id.   \r                                                                       \r\n\n7407(d)(2); 56 Fed.

On  November  14, 1993,  the  EQB submitted  its  SIP\r\n\nrevision  to the  EPA;  in March  of  1994, it  supplemented  the\r\n\nrevised SIP.   On August 11, 1994, the EPA  published for comment\r\n\nits proposed full approval of the SIP revision.  See 59 Fed.

On May 31,  1995, after conducting  public meetings and\r\n\nevaluating the  comments received,  including those  submitted by\r\n\npetitioner, the EPA approved the revised SIP and published notice\r\n\nof its approval and promulgation.  See 60 Fed. Reg.  28,333.

See,  e.g., FTC v.  Standard Oil\r                                                                           \r\n\nCo.,  449 U.S.  232,  243 (1980)  (\"final  agency action\"  status\r             \r\n\ndesigned to promote  \"administrative efficiency\").   Petitioner's\r\n\ncounterargument that  Congress intended to  defer judicial review\r\n\nuntil the revised SIP has been promulgated is untenable, since it\r\n\nmisconstrues the plain language  of the statute and misapprehends\r\n\nthe equally clear intent of Congress.   Cf. Garcia v. Cecos Int'l\r                                                                           \r\n\nInc., 761  F.2d 76,  79  (1st Cir.  1985) (plain  language of  42\r              \r\n\nU.S.C.    6972(b), requiring sixty days'  notice before commence-\r\n\nment of \"private  citizen\" suit  is \"not a  technical wrinkle  or\r\n\nsuperfluous formality that federal courts may waive at will . . .\r\n\n[but]  part of  the jurisdictional  conferral from  Congress that\r\n\ncannot be altered by the courts.\").\r\n\n          As the  EPA points out, Congress well understood how to\r\n\ndefer review had that  been its intent.  Indeed,  it specifically\r\n\nprovided for deferred judicial  review of classifications of PM10\r                                                                   \r\n\nnonattainment areas until agency action has been taken on the SIP\r\n\nor any  SIP revision.

Thus,  the absence  of  a\r                                         \r\n\nsimilar deferment for  nonattainment designations affords confir-\r                                                           \r\n\nmation that these EPA actions were meant to be subject to immedi-\r\n\nate  review.  We  therefore conclude that  the PM10 nonattainment\r\n\ndesignation for Guaynabo became a final agency action for purpos-\r\n\nes of judicial review upon its publication by  EPA in the Federal\r                                                                           \r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nRegister  as directed  in the  1990 CAA  amendments.1   Thus, the\r                  \r\n\npetition for review is time-barred. \r\n\n                                II\r                                          II\r\n\n          Petitioner  next  claims  that  it  was \"arbitrary  and\r\n\ncapricious\" to approve the revised SIP  issued by the EQB.  Since\r\n\nthe  revised  SIP comports  with  the  statutory requirement  for\r\n\nensuring  attainment of  the NAAQS  for PM10  in a  moderate non-\r\n\nattainment area, this claim fails on the merits. \r\n\n          Congress has mandated various SIP criteria as prerequi-\r\n\nsites  to EPA approval.  See 42  U.S.C.    7410, 7513(a) and (b).\r                                      \r\n\nThe CAA  generally allows States considerable  latitude in deter-\r\n\nmining how  to meet  these SIP criteria.

Petitioner cannot revive  its time-barred claim by solic-\r\niting  an EPA  response to  petitioner's comment  challenging the\r\ndesignation, especially since the EPA in this case simply reiter-\r\nated its original position.

Petitioner cannot revive  its time-barred claim by solic-\r\niting  an EPA  response to  petitioner's comment  challenging the\r\ndesignation, especially since the EPA in this case simply reiter-\r\nated its original position.
