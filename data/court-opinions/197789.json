In  form,  this  appeal seeks\r                                        \r\n\nreview  of the district  court's refusal to  grant injunctive\r\n\nrelief   to  the  plaintiff,   Action  for  Boston  Community\r\n\nDevelopment (\"ABCD\"), a major provider of Head Start services\r\n\nin Boston.   In substance,  this is an  administrative review\r\n\nproceeding by which  ABCD seeks to  overturn the decision  by\r\n\nthe Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") to select\r\n\na different  grantee to  receive funds for  a new  Head Start\r\n\nproject in Boston.  The pertinent facts are undisputed.\r\n\n     The Head  Start program  is designed  to deliver  social\r\n\nservices  to economically  disadvantaged  children and  their\r\n\nfamilies.  42  U.S.C.   9831.  To  provide such services, HHS\r\n\nmakes  grants to  private entities,  like  ABCD.   ABCD is  a\r\n\nlongstanding  Head Start grantee in Boston, responsible for a\r\n\nnumber  of diverse programs, and it tells us that in a recent\r\n\nyear its grants exceeded $20 million.\r\n\n     From  1982 to  1995,  the  year  it  lost  its  funding,\r\n\nEsquelita Aquebana, Inc. operated  a Head Start program  in a\r\n\nBoston area known  as Uphams Corner, comprising a  portion of\r\n\nRoxbury, Dorchester and the South  End of Boston.  In January\r\n\n1996,  HHS  announced  that  a  grant  would  be  made  to  a\r\n\nreplacement  provider  of  services in  Uphams  Corner  in an\r\n\namount  somewhat  exceeding  $500,000.    Two  of  the  three\r\n\napplicants  for the  funds were  ABCD  and Dimmock  Community\r\n\nHealth Center (\"Dimmock\").\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\n     For many years, Congress has provided that HHS must give\r\n\n\"priority\" to Head  Start agencies which were  receiving Head\r\n\nStart  funds  on August  13,  1981, \"unless  [in  the current\r\n\nphrasing]  the  Secretary  makes a  finding  that  the agency\r\n\ninvolved fails  to meet  program,  financial management,  and\r\n\nother  requirements established by the Secretary.\"  42 U.S.C.\r\n\n   9836(c)(1).    HHS  apparently  took  no account  of  this\r\n\npriority since its announcement said that the funding was \"to\r\n\nbe competitively awarded.\"   In any case, HHS  established an\r\n\nindependent panel  to review  the applicants and  on May  13,\r\n\n1996, the panel awarded ABCD 419 points; Dimmock, 354 points;\r\n\nand the third applicant, 266 points.\r\n\n     At the same  time, HHS was undertaking  a regular review\r\n\nof all of ABCD's 26 Head Start program  sites.  HHS completed\r\n\nits  review  of   ABCD's  Parent  Child  Center,   a  special\r\n\ndemonstration  program  providing  services for  infants  and\r\n\ntoddlers,  on May  10,  1996.   The  review  of this  program\r\n\nrevealed  serious  deficiencies  in  the health,  disability,\r\n\nparental  involvement  and social  service  components.   HHS\r\n\nsummarized  the problem as one of \"inadequate agency capacity\r\n\nto plan, and manage the delivery of Head Start services.\"\r\n\n     Head   Start   programs   are  run   through   the   HHS\r\n\nAdministration for Children and Families.  On August 2, 1996,\r\n\nthe local  regional administrator,  Hugh Galligan,  announced\r\n\nthe selection  of Dimmock  as the Head  Start agency  for the\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nUphams Corner  program.   Galligan reported  to his  superior\r\n\nthat \"[w]hile ABCD's [periodic review]  results are generally\r\n\npositive, a recent  review of its  Parent Child Center  (PCC)\r\n\nprogram showed it was seriously deficient.\"  This report also\r                                                     \r\n\nstated that Dimmock was running  a Head Start program in good\r\n\nstanding  and  that  both  Galligan's  organization  and  its\r\n\nMassachusetts  state  counterpart  \"agreed that  the  Dimmock\r\n\nproposal  more  clearly  responded  to  the  opportunity  for\r\n\ncreative, comprehensive and flexible programming.\"\r\n\n     On  August  14, 1996,  ABCD  brought  this  case in  the\r\n\ndistrict  court, seeking  to  enjoin the  award  of funds  to\r\n\nDimmock  on the  ground that  HHS had  failed to  respect the\r\n\nstatutory priority to which  ABCD was conditionally  entitled\r\n\nunder     9836(c)(1).   When  the  administrative  record was\r\n\nlodged, the  district court  found no record  of a  ruling on\r\n\nABCD's right to a priority.   On December 19, 1996, the court\r\n\nordered HHS to determine explicitly whether ABCD was entitled\r\n\nto  a  priority  and  to  explain the  reasons  for  the  HHS\r\n\ndetermination.  \r\n\n     In  response, HHS filed  a declaration of  Hugh Galligan\r\n\nstating that ABCD did not qualify for the statutory  priority\r\n\n\"because  of the  May  10  finding that  ABCD  fails to  meet\r\n\nprogram,   financial  management,   and  other   requirements\r\n\nestablished  by the Secretary,\"  and reaffirming his previous\r\n\naward  of the grant  to Dimock.  HHS  also filed a memorandum\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\ndated  March 21,  1997, from  Olivia  Golden, then  Principal\r\n\nDeputy Assistant  Secretary, Administration for  Children and\r\n\nFamilies, ratifying  Galligan's  selection of  Dimock.   ABCD\r\n\nthen challenged the authority of  Golden and Galligan to make\r\n\nthis  decision.   On June  9,  1997, Golden  issued a  second\r\n\nmemorandum, further ratifying all decisions and actions taken\r\n\nby Galligan in the matter up to that date.\r\n\n     On July  2, 1997, the  district court filed  an opinion,\r\n\nAction  for  Boston Community  Development, Inc.  v. Shalala,\r                                                                        \r\n\n1997  WL 677447 (D.  Mass. 1997), granting  final judgment in\r\n\nfavor of HHS.   The  court ruled  that even  if Galligan  had\r\n\nlacked the necessary  authority at the  outset, that gap  had\r\n\nbeen filled by  the subsequent ratification.   On the merits,\r\n\nthe district  court found that  the decision to  withhold the\r\n\npriority was  neither in  violation of  law nor  unreasonable\r\n\nunder  the  standards  usually  applied in  reviewing  agency\r\n\naction.\r\n\n     On  the  appeal now  before  us, ABCD's  first  and most\r\n\nextensive  argument  is  that the  decision  to  withhold the\r\n\npriority,  even  if  properly ratified  (which  ABCD denies),\r\n\nrested on legal errors.  The  main thrust of its argument  is\r\n\nthat  the statute  does  not  permit HHS  \"to  deny ABCD  its\r\n\npriority .  . . on  the basis of  temporary, program-specific\r\n\ndeficiency findings  with respect  to one  of the  twenty-six\r\n\nHead Start  program  sites that  ABCD operates,  a site  that\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nconstitutes  only a small  part of ABCD's  overall Head Start\r\n\nprogram activities.\"\r\n\n     So far as ABCD's issue presents a question of  statutory\r\n\nconstruction--and  in some respects it does--our review is de\r                                                                         \r\n\nnovo, tempered by whatever deference is to be accorded to the\r                \r\n\nSecretary's  construction of  the statute  under  the Chevron\r                                                                         \r\n\ndoctrine or otherwise.  See Chevron, U.S.A.,  Inc. v. Natural\r                                                                         \r\n\nResources Defense Council, Inc.,  467 U.S. 837 (1984).   Even\r                                           \r\n\nwithout full-scale Chevron  deference, courts usually give  a\r                                      \r\n\nrespectful hearing to the agency charged with administering a\r\n\nstatute.   Because our own  view of the statute  accords with\r\n\nthat of HHS, we  need go no further than that  in the present\r\n\ncase.\r\n\n     We  agree  with  ABCD that  Congress  made  a considered\r\n\ndecision  to  give  a  priority  to  any  Head  Start  agency\r\n\nreceiving funds on August 13, 1981.  The expressed rationale-\r\n\n-to give preference to stability and experience--may not seem\r\n\nto jibe with  the selection of  the single, now  increasingly\r\n\nancient date.   But choices of this kind  are always somewhat\r\n\narbitrary, and  Congress has  maintained this priority  date,\r\n\naltering  the statutory language only slightly over a lengthy\r\n\nperiod.\r\n\n     On this premise, ABCD concludes  that Congress therefore\r                                                                         \r\n\nmust  have intended that the condition for denying priority--\r\n\n\"that  the agency involved  fails to meet  program, financial\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nmanagement,  and   other  requirements  established   by  the\r\n\nSecretary\"--be based on a \"overall\" failure to the Head Start\r\n\nagency to meet  HHS standards.  What ABCD  means by \"overall\"\r\n\nis not entirely clear, but  ABCD makes its arguments somewhat\r\n\nmore  concrete by  asserting  that the  failure  of a  single\r\n\nprogram,  conducted  by  a multi-program  Head  Start agency,\r\n\ncannot be an \"overall\" failure.  Congress  could have written\r\n\nthe statute in this manner but did not do so.\r\n\n     The  word \"overall\" simply  does not appear  anywhere in\r\n\nthe   priority  provision  (section   9836(c)).    Given  the\r\n\ncongressional  purpose, we  agree that  the  failure to  meet\r\n\nstandards would certainly have to be substantial and relevant\r\n\nas  opposed  to slight  or  inconsequential.   But  there  is\r\n\nnothing  in the  language  of  the  priority  provision  that\r\n\nrequires  that the failure be one that affects all or many of\r\n\nthe programs the agency may be supervising.\r\n\n     Further,  the failure to  manage properly  an individual\r\n\nprogram might be very informative as  to the agency's ability\r\n\nto  take  on  new responsibilities.    Deficiencies  within a\r\n\nsingle program might  be more important to HHS  than a single\r\n\ndeficiency--say in some aspect  of bookkeeping--that infected\r\n\nall of the programs run by a Head Start agency.   Whether the\r\n\nfailures   in  ABCD's  Parent  Child  Center  were  of  great\r\n\nmagnitude is a different question to which we return below.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\n     One  could argue, with a better footing in the statutory\r\n\nlanguage, that  there must be  at least multiple  failures of\r\n\ndifferent kinds,  since the statute calls for  a finding that\r\n\nthe  agency \"fails to meet program, financial management, and\r                                                                         \r\n\nother  requirements established  by the Secretary.\"   Section\r\n\n9836(c)(1)  (emphasis added).  The word \"and\" usually denotes\r\n\nthe   conjunctive,  but  the   rule  is  not   absolute  when\r\n\ncontradicted by context,  Reiter v. Sonotone Corp.,  442 U.S.\r                                                              \r\n\n330, 338 (1979), as we think it is here.  Especially in light\r\n\nof the  catch-all  category \"other  requirements,\"  the  term\r\n\n\"and\" certainly was intended to mean \"and/or.\"\r\n\n     This is borne out by common-sense considerations.  If  a\r\n\nHead Start agency  failed utterly in the  delivery of program\r\n\nservices,  Congress   could  not   have  intended   that  its\r\n\nmeticulously  kept books would assure it a statutory priority\r\n\nas  to  new programs.    As  it  happens, here  Galligan  did\r\n\nexpressly  find, in  a determination  later  ratified by  the\r\n\nActing  Assistant Secretary,  that ABCD  had  failed to  meet\r\n\n\"program, financial management, and other requirements.\"\r\n\n     Finally, there is  little mileage for ABCD  in its claim\r\n\nthat   the   deficiency   cannot   be   merely   \"temporary.\"\r\n\nPractically  all  deficiencies  can be  made  \"temporary\"  by\r\n\ndiscovering and  rectifying them.   The  question is  whether\r\n\ntheir  existence  is a  warning  signal that  the  Head Start\r\n\nagency ought  to be  correcting the  deficiencies that  exist\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\nbefore  it takes on new programs--which might further stretch\r\n\nmanagement resources already shown to be inadequate.\r\n\n     ABCD   argues  that  its  reading  of  section  9836  is\r\n\nsupported by section 9836a enacted by Congress in 1994.  Pub.\r\n\nL. No. 103-252,    108, 108 Stat. 631.   Whereas section 9836\r\n\ninvolves  the  designation  of Head  Start  agencies, section\r\n\n9836a  requires HHS to  establish quality standards  for Head\r\n\nStart agencies  and to  monitor such  agencies and  programs.\r\n\nThe deficiencies in the Parent  Child Center found in the May\r\n\n10,  1996  report,  which Galligan  invoked  in  denying ABCD\r\n\npriority, derived from a monitoring program carried out under\r\n\nthe newly enacted section 9836a.\r\n\n     ABCD  argues that an \"overall\" failure is required under\r\n\nsection  9836(c)(1) because section 9836a refers at one point\r\n\nto  the need for the  Secretary to promulgate \"minimum levels\r\n\nof  overall accomplishment\"  that a  Head  Start agency  must\r\n\nachieve to  meet the primary \"standards\" to be established by\r\n\nthe Secretary  for program services,  for administrative  and\r\n\nfinancial   management,  and  for  many  other  subjects,    \r\n\n9836a(a)(1),  (2),  and  because elsewhere  the  Secretary is\r\n\nrequired to conduct  a \"full review\" of each  agency at least\r\n\nonce every three years.  Id. subsection (c)(1)(A).  This kind\r                                        \r\n\nof   wrenching  words  out  of  context  is  not  persuasive:\r\n\n\"overall accomplishment\"  and  \"full review\"  make  sense  in\r\n\ncontext, and neither phrase has the same  meaning as \"overall\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\nfailure\"--the  phrase ABCD would  like to substitute  for the\r\n\nword \"failure\" in the prior section of the statute.\r\n\n     ABCD next objects to HHS' use of the  findings made in a\r\n\nperiodic   review  as  the  basis  for  denying  a  statutory\r\n\npriority.   ABCD points out that  other provisions of section\r\n\n9835a  address  the  correction of  deficiencies  found  in a\r\n\nperiodic  review   by  quality  improvement  plans   and  the\r\n\ntermination  of  the  agency  if  the  deficiencies  are  not\r\n\ncorrected.  But nothing in these provisions prevents HHS from\r\n\nconsidering  the findings of a periodic review in determining\r\n\nunder the prior section whether  the Head Start agency should\r\n\nlose its priority.\r\n\n     If  this were an  ordinary agency review  proceeding, we\r\n\nwould now reach  the usual question whether the  agency had a\r\n\nrational basis for  its action or whether,  contrariwise, its\r\n\naction was arbitrary,  capricious or unreasonable.   And, one\r\n\nwould expect ABCD to  explain why the findings of  deficiency\r\n\nrelied on  by HHS were mistaken or unsupported or why, to the\r\n\nextent they might  be correct and adequately  supported, they\r\n\nwere  not sufficiently  serious, even  taken as  a whole,  to\r\n\njustify the significant step of the denial of priority.\r\n\n     If such an attack were made, we would take it seriously.\r\n\nAgencies  are  entitled to  considerable  deference  in their\r\n\nformal  fact  finding  and  in  the  application  of  general\r\n\nstandards  to specific facts  within their expertise,  but in\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\nneither case is  deference unlimited.  Congress has,  as ABCD\r\n\nargued,  treated the  priority  as  a  matter  of  importance\r\n\n(although  the condition attached  to it is  also important).\r\n\nThis court has  been willing enough even  in fairly technical\r\n\nareas to overturn agency decisions which appeared to us to be\r\n\nunreasonable or  inadequately supported.   See, e.g.,  Puerto\r                                                                         \r\n\nRico Sun Oil Co. v. EPA, 8 F.3d 73, 76-77 (1st Cir. 1993).\r                                   \r\n\n     ABCD  has chosen  not to  make  such an  attack, and  we\r\n\ntherefore have no occasion  to review in detail  the findings\r\n\nof the May  10, 1996, review of the Parent Child Center which\r\n\nare summarized  in the  district court's  decision.   1997 WL\r\n\n677477 at *19.   It is enough to say that  the criticisms are\r\n\nnot narrowly  confined or  limited to  trivial matters.   And\r\n\nwhile ABCD has  stressed that the Parent Child  program was a\r\n\nsmall  portion of its budget, it implies that the figure is 4\r\n\npercent  of $22  million--most would  not  regard a  million-\r\n\ndollar program as small change.\r\n\n     ABCD's next line  of argument contests the  authority of\r\n\nGalligan to make the priority decision  at all.   We condense\r\n\nthe background which  is discussed at length  in the district\r\n\ncourt decision.   1997 WL 677447 at  *6-13.  The gist  of the\r\n\nmatter  is that, as Regional Administrator, Galligan had from\r\n\nthe outset the authority to  award Head Start grants, but the\r\n\nCommissioner  of  Youth  and   Family  Services--then  Olivia\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\nGolden--had  the  authority  to   designate  new  Head  Start\r\n\nagencies.\r\n\n     The district court  deemed it unclear  which of the  two\r\n\nofficials had  the authority to  grant or deny  the priority,\r\n\nbut found that  it did not matter.  It concluded that even if\r\n\nGalligan had lacked  the authority in August 1996, Golden had\r\n\nexplicitly ratified his actions in  June 1997.  By that time,\r\n\nGolden  was Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary and had been\r\n\nnominated for the vacant Assistant Secretary position.\r\n\n     We agree with  the district court that as  the Principal\r\n\nDeputy and  nominee, Golden could  exercise the powers  of an\r\n\nassistant secretary.   ABCD admits that the  proper assistant\r\n\nsecretary  had the authority  to make priority  decisions but\r\n\nargues   that  Golden   was   nominated   for  an   assistant\r\n\nsecretaryship other than the one with authority to decide the\r\n\nissue.   Despite  some confusion  over titles,  we adopt  the\r\n\ndistrict  court's reasoning for  rejection of  this argument.\r\n\nId. at *12.\r               \r\n\n     ABCD's  more interesting  argument is that  Golden could\r\n\nnot  ratify   Galligan's  decision   \"retroactively.\"     All\r\n\nratifications  are retroactive in the sense that they purport\r\n\nto   validate  a  prior   action  that  might   otherwise  be\r\n\nunauthorized.  But ABCD relies here on an  HHS administrative\r\n\nprocedural  manual  that  refers  to  ratification  of  prior\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                         -12-\r\r\n\nactions  being  permissible  in \"special  circumstances\"  and\r\n\n\"with the approval\" of the general counsel's office.  \r\n\n     We  know  almost   nothing  about  the  scope   of  this\r\n\nprovision, or the  legal significance of the  manual, because\r\n\nABCD did  not  make  this  argument in  the  district  court.\r\n\nABCD's  objection  is   therefore  waived.    See   McCoy  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nMassachusetts Institute of  Technology, 950 F.2d 13,  22 (1st\r                                                  \r\n\nCir. 1991).   Accordingly, we  do not reach  HHS' alternative\r\n\nargument that  the record  shows that  the general  counsel's\r\n\noffice informally acquiesced in the ratification.\r\n\n     Finally, ABCD says  that the ratification is  an invalid\r\n\n\"post hoc rationalization.\"   This epithet  has been used  by\r\n\ncourts  in various  ways  but most  often  to prevent  agency\r\n\nlawyers  from  providing  in  briefs  necessary  findings  or\r                   \r\n\nreasoning  omitted from  the agency's  decision.

In substance, this is an administrative review proceeding by which ABCD seeks to overturn the decision by the Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") to select a different grantee to receive funds for a new Head Start project in Boston.  The pertinent facts are undisputed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Head Start program is designed to deliver social services to economically disadvantaged children and their families.  42 U.S.C. &#167; 9831.  To provide such services, HHS makes grants to private entities, like ABCD.  ABCD is a longstanding Head Start grantee in Boston, responsible for a number of diverse programs, and it tells us that in a recent year its grants exceeded $20 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From 1982 to 1995, the year it lost its funding, Esquelita Aquebana, Inc. operated a Head Start program in a Boston area known as Uphams Corner, comprising a portion of Roxbury, Dorchester and the South End of Boston.  In January 1996, HHS announced that a grant would be made to a replacement provider of services in Uphams Corner in an amount somewhat exceeding $500,000.  Two of the three applicants for the funds were ABCD and Dimmock Community Health Center (\"Dimmock\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For many years, Congress has provided that HHS must give \"priority\" to Head Start agencies which were receiving Head Start funds on August 13, 1981, \"unless [in the current phrasing] the Secretary makes a finding that the agency involved fails to meet program, financial management, and other requirements established by the Secretary.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 9836(c)(1).  HHS apparently took no account of this priority since its announcement said that the funding was \"to be competitively awarded.\"   In any case, HHS established an independent panel to review the applicants and on May 13, 1996, the panel awarded ABCD 419 points;  Dimmock, 354 points;  and the third applicant, 266 points.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time, HHS was undertaking a regular review of all of ABCD's 26 Head Start program sites.  HHS completed its review of ABCD's Parent Child Center, a special demonstration program providing services for infants and toddlers, on May 10, 1996.  The review of this program revealed serious deficiencies in the health, disability, parental involvement and social service components.  HHS summarized the problem as one of \"inadequate agency capacity to plan, and manage the delivery of Head Start services.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Head Start programs are run through the HHS Administration for Children and Families.  On August 2, 1996, the local regional administrator, Hugh Galligan, announced the selection of Dimmock as the Head Start agency for the Uphams Corner program.  Galligan reported to his superior that \"[w]hile ABCD's [periodic review] results are generally positive, a recent review of its Parent Child Center (PCC) program showed it was seriously deficient.\"   This report also stated that Dimmock was running a Head Start program in good standing and that both Galligan's organization and its Massachusetts state counterpart \"agreed that the Dimmock proposal more clearly responded to the opportunity for creative, comprehensive and flexible programming.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 14, 1996, ABCD brought this case in the district court, seeking to enjoin the award of funds to Dimmock on the ground that HHS had failed to respect the statutory priority to which ABCD was conditionally entitled under &#167; 9836(c)(1).  When the administrative record was lodged, the district court found no record of a ruling on ABCD's right to a priority.  On December 19, 1996, the court ordered HHS to determine explicitly whether ABCD was entitled to a priority and to explain the reasons for the HHS determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, HHS filed a declaration of Hugh Galligan stating that ABCD did not qualify for the statutory priority \"because of the May 10 finding that ABCD fails to meet program, financial management, and other requirements established by the Secretary,\" and reaffirming his previous award of the grant to Dimock.  HHS also filed a memorandum dated March 21, 1997, from Olivia Golden, then Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary, Administration for Children and Families, ratifying Galligan's selection of Dimock.  ABCD then challenged the authority of Golden and Galligan to make this decision.  On June 9, 1997, Golden issued a second memorandum, further ratifying all decisions and actions taken by Galligan in the matter up to that date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 2, 1997, the district court filed an opinion, Action for Boston Community Development, Inc. v. Shalala, 983 F.Supp. 222 (D.Mass.1997), granting final judgment in favor of HHS.  The court ruled that even if Galligan had lacked the necessary authority at the outset, that gap had been filled by the subsequent ratification.  On the merits, the district court found that the decision to withhold the priority was neither in violation of law nor unreasonable under the standards usually applied in reviewing agency action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the appeal now before us, ABCD's first and most extensive argument is that the decision to withhold the priority, even if properly ratified (which ABCD denies), rested on legal errors.  The main thrust of its argument is that the statute does not permit HHS \"to deny ABCD its priority ... on the basis of temporary, program-specific deficiency findings with respect to one of the twenty-six Head Start program sites that ABCD operates, a site that constitutes only a small part of ABCD's overall Head Start program activities.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So far as ABCD's issue presents a question of statutory construction--and in some respects it does--our review is de novo, tempered by whatever deference is to be accorded to the Secretary's construction of the statute under the Chevron doctrine or otherwise.  See Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).  Even without full-scale Chevron deference, courts usually give a respectful hearing to the agency charged with administering a statute.  Because our own view of the statute accords with that of HHS, we need go no further than that in the present case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with ABCD that Congress made a considered decision to give a priority to any Head Start agency receiving funds on August 13, 1981.  The expressed rationale--to give preference to stability and experience--may not seem to jibe with the selection of the single, now increasingly ancient date.  But choices of this kind are always somewhat arbitrary, and Congress has maintained this priority date, altering the statutory language only slightly over a lengthy period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this premise, ABCD concludes that Congress therefore must have intended that the condition for denying priority--\"that the agency involved fails to meet program, financial management, and other requirements established by the Secretary\"--be based on a \"overall\" failure to the Head Start agency to meet HHS standards.  What ABCD means by \"overall\" is not entirely clear, but ABCD makes its arguments somewhat more concrete by asserting that the failure of a single program, conducted by a multi-program Head Start agency, cannot be an \"overall\" failure.  Congress could have written the statute in this manner but did not do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The word \"overall\" simply does not appear anywhere in the priority provision (section 9836(c)).  Given the congressional purpose, we agree that the failure to meet standards would certainly have to be substantial and relevant as opposed to slight or inconsequential.  But there is nothing in the language of the priority provision that requires that the failure be one that affects all or many of the programs the agency may be supervising.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the failure to manage properly an individual program might be very informative as to the agency's ability to take on new responsibilities.  Deficiencies within a single program might be more important to HHS than a single deficiency--say in some aspect of bookkeeping--that infected all of the programs run by a Head Start agency.  Whether the failures in ABCD's Parent Child Center were of great magnitude is a different question to which we return below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One could argue, with a better footing in the statutory language, that there must be at least multiple failures of different kinds, since the statute calls for a finding that the agency \"fails to meet program, financial management, and other requirements established by the Secretary.\"  Section 9836(c)(1) (emphasis added).  The word \"and\" usually denotes the conjunctive, but the rule is not absolute when contradicted by context, Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 338, 99 S.Ct. 2326, 2330-31, 60 L.Ed.2d 931 (1979), as we think it is here.  Especially in light of the catch-all category \"other requirements,\" the term \"and\" certainly was intended to mean \"and/or.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is borne out by common-sense considerations.  If a Head Start agency failed utterly in the delivery of program services, Congress could not have intended that its meticulously kept books would assure it a statutory priority as to new programs.  As it happens, here Galligan did expressly find, in a determination later ratified by the Acting Assistant Secretary, that ABCD had failed to meet \"program, financial management, and other requirements.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, there is little mileage for ABCD in its claim that the deficiency cannot be merely \"temporary.\"   Practically all deficiencies can be made \"temporary\" by discovering and rectifying them.  The question is whether their existence is a warning signal that the Head Start agency ought to be correcting the deficiencies that exist before it takes on new programs--which might further stretch management resources already shown to be inadequate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ABCD argues that its reading of section 9836 is supported by section 9836a enacted by Congress in 1994.  Pub.L. No. 103-252, &#167; 108, 108 Stat. 631.  Whereas section 9836 involves the designation of Head Start agencies, section 9836a requires HHS to establish quality standards for Head Start agencies and to monitor such agencies and programs.  The deficiencies in the Parent Child Center found in the May 10, 1996 report, which Galligan invoked in denying ABCD priority, derived from a monitoring program carried out under the newly enacted section 9836a.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ABCD argues that an \"overall\" failure is required under section 9836(c)(1) because section 9836a refers at one point to the need for the Secretary to promulgate \"minimum levels of overall accomplishment\" that a Head Start agency must achieve to meet the primary \"standards\" to be established by the Secretary for program services, for administrative and financial management, and for many other subjects, &#167;&#167; 9836a(a)(1), (2), and because elsewhere the Secretary is required to conduct a \"full review\" of each agency at least once every three years.  Id. subsection (c)(1)(A).  This kind of wrenching words out of context is not persuasive:  \"overall accomplishment\" and \"full review\" make sense in context, and neither phrase has the same meaning as \"overall failure\"--the phrase ABCD would like to substitute for the word \"failure\" in the prior section of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ABCD next objects to HHS' use of the findings made in a periodic review as the basis for denying a statutory priority.  ABCD points out that other provisions of section 9835a address the correction of deficiencies found in a periodic review by quality improvement plans and the termination of the agency if the deficiencies are not corrected.  But nothing in these provisions prevents HHS from considering the findings of a periodic review in determining under the prior section whether the Head Start agency should lose its priority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If this were an ordinary agency review proceeding, we would now reach the usual question whether the agency had a rational basis for its action or whether, contrariwise, its action was arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable.  And, one would expect ABCD to explain why the findings of deficiency relied on by HHS were mistaken or unsupported or why, to the extent they might be correct and adequately supported, they were not sufficiently serious, even taken as a whole, to justify the significant step of the denial of priority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If such an attack were made, we would take it seriously.  Agencies are entitled to considerable deference in their formal fact finding and in the application of general standards to specific facts within their expertise, but in neither case is deference unlimited.  Congress has, as ABCD argued, treated the priority as a matter of importance (although the condition attached to it is also important).  This court has been willing enough even in fairly technical areas to overturn agency decisions which appeared to us to be unreasonable or inadequately supported.  See, e.g., Puerto Rico Sun Oil Co. v. EPA, 8 F.3d 73, 76-77 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ABCD has chosen not to make such an attack, and we therefore have no occasion to review in detail the findings of the May 10, 1996, review of the Parent Child Center which are summarized in the district court's decision.  983 F.Supp. at 239.   It is enough to say that the criticisms are not narrowly confined or limited to trivial matters.  And while ABCD has stressed that the Parent Child program was a small portion of its budget, it implies that the figure is 4 percent of $22 million--most would not regard a million-dollar program as small change.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ABCD's next line of argument contests the authority of Galligan to make the priority decision at all.  We condense the background which is discussed at length in the district court decision.  at 228-34.   The gist of the matter is that, as Regional Administrator, Galligan had from the outset the authority to award Head Start grants, but the Commissioner of Youth and Family Services--then Olivia Golden--had the authority to designate new Head Start agencies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court deemed it unclear which of the two officials had the authority to grant or deny the priority, but found that it did not matter.  It concluded that even if Galligan had lacked the authority in August 1996, Golden had explicitly ratified his actions in June 1997.  By that time, Golden was Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary and had been nominated for the vacant Assistant Secretary position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court that as the Principal Deputy and nominee, Golden could exercise the powers of an assistant secretary.  ABCD admits that the proper assistant secretary had the authority to make priority decisions but argues that Golden was nominated for an assistant secretaryship other than the one with authority to decide the issue.  Despite some confusion over titles, we adopt the district court's reasoning for rejection of this argument.  Id. at 233-34.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ABCD's more interesting argument is that Golden could not ratify Galligan's decision \"retroactively.\"   All ratifications are retroactive in the sense that they purport to validate a prior action that might otherwise be unauthorized.  But ABCD relies here on an HHS administrative procedural manual that refers to ratification of prior actions being permissible in \"special circumstances\" and \"with the approval\" of the general counsel's office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We know almost nothing about the scope of this provision, or the legal significance of the manual, because ABCD did not make this argument in the district court.  ABCD's objection is therefore waived.  See McCoy v. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 950 F.2d 13, 22 (1st Cir.1991).  Accordingly, we do not reach HHS' alternative argument that the record shows that the general counsel's office informally acquiesced in the ratification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, ABCD says that the ratification is an invalid \"post hoc rationalization.\"   This epithet has been used by courts in various ways but most often to prevent agency lawyers from providing in briefs necessary findings or reasoning omitted from the agency's decision.  See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 50, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 2870, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983);  Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168-69, 83 S.Ct. 239, 245-46, 9 L.Ed.2d 207 (1962).  Nothing of the sort is presented here:  both Galligan and Golden agreed, respectively in May and June 1997, that ABCD was properly denied the priority based on information available to them from the time the grant was originally made to Dimock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the usual concern of courts--that the decisionmaker may not have made the necessary determinations--is absent here.  Further, it was the district court itself that ordered HHS to make its priority determination explicit and explain its reasons.  See Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. v. LTV Corp., 496 U.S. 633, 653-54, 110 S.Ct. 2668, 2679-80, 110 L.Ed.2d 579 (1990).  Finally, nothing in the 1997 redeterminations violated any procedural requirements:  We have been pointed to nothing in the statute or regulations that requires any specific procedures before a priority is denied.

United States Dep't of Agric., 102 F.3d 1273, 1289 (1st Cir.1996), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 2510, 138 L.Ed.2d 1013 (1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

In substance, this is an administrative review proceeding by which ABCD seeks to overturn the decision by the Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") to select a different grantee to receive funds for a new Head Start project in Boston.  The pertinent facts are undisputed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Head Start program is designed to deliver social services to economically disadvantaged children and their families.  42 U.S.C. &#167; 9831.  To provide such services, HHS makes grants to private entities, like ABCD.  ABCD is a longstanding Head Start grantee in Boston, responsible for a number of diverse programs, and it tells us that in a recent year its grants exceeded $20 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From 1982 to 1995, the year it lost its funding, Esquelita Aquebana, Inc. operated a Head Start program in a Boston area known as Uphams Corner, comprising a portion of Roxbury, Dorchester and the South End of Boston.  In January 1996, HHS announced that a grant would be made to a replacement provider of services in Uphams Corner in an amount somewhat exceeding $500,000.  Two of the three applicants for the funds were ABCD and Dimmock Community Health Center (\"Dimmock\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For many years, Congress has provided that HHS must give \"priority\" to Head Start agencies which were receiving Head Start funds on August 13, 1981, \"unless [in the current phrasing] the Secretary makes a finding that the agency involved fails to meet program, financial management, and other requirements established by the Secretary.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 9836(c)(1).  HHS apparently took no account of this priority since its announcement said that the funding was \"to be competitively awarded.\"   In any case, HHS established an independent panel to review the applicants and on May 13, 1996, the panel awarded ABCD 419 points;  Dimmock, 354 points;  and the third applicant, 266 points.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time, HHS was undertaking a regular review of all of ABCD's 26 Head Start program sites.  HHS completed its review of ABCD's Parent Child Center, a special demonstration program providing services for infants and toddlers, on May 10, 1996.  The review of this program revealed serious deficiencies in the health, disability, parental involvement and social service components.  HHS summarized the problem as one of \"inadequate agency capacity to plan, and manage the delivery of Head Start services.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Head Start programs are run through the HHS Administration for Children and Families.  On August 2, 1996, the local regional administrator, Hugh Galligan, announced the selection of Dimmock as the Head Start agency for the Uphams Corner program.  Galligan reported to his superior that \"[w]hile ABCD's [periodic review] results are generally positive, a recent review of its Parent Child Center (PCC) program showed it was seriously deficient.\"   This report also stated that Dimmock was running a Head Start program in good standing and that both Galligan's organization and its Massachusetts state counterpart \"agreed that the Dimmock proposal more clearly responded to the opportunity for creative, comprehensive and flexible programming.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 14, 1996, ABCD brought this case in the district court, seeking to enjoin the award of funds to Dimmock on the ground that HHS had failed to respect the statutory priority to which ABCD was conditionally entitled under &#167; 9836(c)(1).  When the administrative record was lodged, the district court found no record of a ruling on ABCD's right to a priority.  On December 19, 1996, the court ordered HHS to determine explicitly whether ABCD was entitled to a priority and to explain the reasons for the HHS determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, HHS filed a declaration of Hugh Galligan stating that ABCD did not qualify for the statutory priority \"because of the May 10 finding that ABCD fails to meet program, financial management, and other requirements established by the Secretary,\" and reaffirming his previous award of the grant to Dimock.  HHS also filed a memorandum dated March 21, 1997, from Olivia Golden, then Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary, Administration for Children and Families, ratifying Galligan's selection of Dimock.  ABCD then challenged the authority of Golden and Galligan to make this decision.  On June 9, 1997, Golden issued a second memorandum, further ratifying all decisions and actions taken by Galligan in the matter up to that date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 2, 1997, the district court filed an opinion, Action for Boston Community Development, Inc. v. Shalala, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">222</span></span> (D.Mass.1997), granting final judgment in favor of HHS.  The court ruled that even if Galligan had lacked the necessary authority at the outset, that gap had been filled by the subsequent ratification.  On the merits, the district court found that the decision to withhold the priority was neither in violation of law nor unreasonable under the standards usually applied in reviewing agency action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the appeal now before us, ABCD's first and most extensive argument is that the decision to withhold the priority, even if properly ratified (which ABCD denies), rested on legal errors.  The main thrust of its argument is that the statute does not permit HHS \"to deny ABCD its priority ... on the basis of temporary, program-specific deficiency findings with respect to one of the twenty-six Head Start program sites that ABCD operates, a site that constitutes only a small part of ABCD's overall Head Start program activities.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So far as ABCD's issue presents a question of statutory construction--and in some respects it does--our review is de novo, tempered by whatever deference is to be accorded to the Secretary's construction of the statute under the Chevron doctrine or otherwise.  See Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span> (1984).  Even without full-scale Chevron deference, courts usually give a respectful hearing to the agency charged with administering a statute.  Because our own view of the statute accords with that of HHS, we need go no further than that in the present case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with ABCD that Congress made a considered decision to give a priority to any Head Start agency receiving funds on August 13, 1981.  The expressed rationale--to give preference to stability and experience--may not seem to jibe with the selection of the single, now increasingly ancient date.  But choices of this kind are always somewhat arbitrary, and Congress has maintained this priority date, altering the statutory language only slightly over a lengthy period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this premise, ABCD concludes that Congress therefore must have intended that the condition for denying priority--\"that the agency involved fails to meet program, financial management, and other requirements established by the Secretary\"--be based on a \"overall\" failure to the Head Start agency to meet HHS standards.  What ABCD means by \"overall\" is not entirely clear, but ABCD makes its arguments somewhat more concrete by asserting that the failure of a single program, conducted by a multi-program Head Start agency, cannot be an \"overall\" failure.  Congress could have written the statute in this manner but did not do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The word \"overall\" simply does not appear anywhere in the priority provision (section 9836(c)).  Given the congressional purpose, we agree that the failure to meet standards would certainly have to be substantial and relevant as opposed to slight or inconsequential.  But there is nothing in the language of the priority provision that requires that the failure be one that affects all or many of the programs the agency may be supervising.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the failure to manage properly an individual program might be very informative as to the agency's ability to take on new responsibilities.  Deficiencies within a single program might be more important to HHS than a single deficiency--say in some aspect of bookkeeping--that infected all of the programs run by a Head Start agency.  Whether the failures in ABCD's Parent Child Center were of great magnitude is a different question to which we return below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One could argue, with a better footing in the statutory language, that there must be at least multiple failures of different kinds, since the statute calls for a finding that the agency \"fails to meet program, financial management, and other requirements established by the Secretary.\"  Section 9836(c)(1) (emphasis added).  The word \"and\" usually denotes the conjunctive, but the rule is not absolute when contradicted by context, Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110101\"><a href=\"/opinion/110101/reiter-v-sonotone-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span>, 338, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110101\"><a href=\"/opinion/110101/reiter-v-sonotone-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2326</span></a></span>, 2330-31, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110101\"><a href=\"/opinion/110101/reiter-v-sonotone-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">931</span></a></span> (1979), as we think it is here.  Especially in light of the catch-all category \"other requirements,\" the term \"and\" certainly was intended to mean \"and/or.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is borne out by common-sense considerations.  If a Head Start agency failed utterly in the delivery of program services, Congress could not have intended that its meticulously kept books would assure it a statutory priority as to new programs.  As it happens, here Galligan did expressly find, in a determination later ratified by the Acting Assistant Secretary, that ABCD had failed to meet \"program, financial management, and other requirements.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, there is little mileage for ABCD in its claim that the deficiency cannot be merely \"temporary.\"   Practically all deficiencies can be made \"temporary\" by discovering and rectifying them.  The question is whether their existence is a warning signal that the Head Start agency ought to be correcting the deficiencies that exist before it takes on new programs--which might further stretch management resources already shown to be inadequate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ABCD argues that its reading of section 9836 is supported by section 9836a enacted by Congress in 1994.  Pub.L. No. 103-252, &#167; 108, 108 Stat. 631.  Whereas section 9836 involves the designation of Head Start agencies, section 9836a requires HHS to establish quality standards for Head Start agencies and to monitor such agencies and programs.  The deficiencies in the Parent Child Center found in the May 10, 1996 report, which Galligan invoked in denying ABCD priority, derived from a monitoring program carried out under the newly enacted section 9836a.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ABCD argues that an \"overall\" failure is required under section 9836(c)(1) because section 9836a refers at one point to the need for the Secretary to promulgate \"minimum levels of overall accomplishment\" that a Head Start agency must achieve to meet the primary \"standards\" to be established by the Secretary for program services, for administrative and financial management, and for many other subjects, &#167;&#167; 9836a(a)(1), (2), and because elsewhere the Secretary is required to conduct a \"full review\" of each agency at least once every three years.  Id. subsection (c)(1)(A).  This kind of wrenching words out of context is not persuasive:  \"overall accomplishment\" and \"full review\" make sense in context, and neither phrase has the same meaning as \"overall failure\"--the phrase ABCD would like to substitute for the word \"failure\" in the prior section of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ABCD next objects to HHS' use of the findings made in a periodic review as the basis for denying a statutory priority.  ABCD points out that other provisions of section 9835a address the correction of deficiencies found in a periodic review by quality improvement plans and the termination of the agency if the deficiencies are not corrected.  But nothing in these provisions prevents HHS from considering the findings of a periodic review in determining under the prior section whether the Head Start agency should lose its priority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If this were an ordinary agency review proceeding, we would now reach the usual question whether the agency had a rational basis for its action or whether, contrariwise, its action was arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable.  And, one would expect ABCD to explain why the findings of deficiency relied on by HHS were mistaken or unsupported or why, to the extent they might be correct and adequately supported, they were not sufficiently serious, even taken as a whole, to justify the significant step of the denial of priority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If such an attack were made, we would take it seriously.  Agencies are entitled to considerable deference in their formal fact finding and in the application of general standards to specific facts within their expertise, but in neither case is deference unlimited.  Congress has, as ABCD argued, treated the priority as a matter of importance (although the condition attached to it is also important).  This court has been willing enough even in fairly technical areas to overturn agency decisions which appeared to us to be unreasonable or inadequately supported.  See, e.g., Puerto Rico Sun Oil Co. v.

Accordingly, we do not reach HHS' alternative argument that the record shows that the general counsel's office informally acquiesced in the ratification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, ABCD says that the ratification is an invalid \"post hoc rationalization.\"   This epithet has been used by courts in various ways but most often to prevent agency lawyers from providing in briefs necessary findings or reasoning omitted from the agency's decision.  See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins.

Nothing of the sort is presented here:  both Galligan and Golden agreed, respectively in May and June 1997, that ABCD was properly denied the priority based on information available to them from the time the grant was originally made to Dimock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the usual concern of courts--that the decisionmaker may not have made the necessary determinations--is absent here.  Further, it was the district court itself that ordered HHS to make its priority determination explicit and explain its reasons.  See Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. v. LTV Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112466\"><a href=\"/opinion/112466/pension-benefit-guaranty-corporation-v-ltv-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">633</span></a></span>, 653-54, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112466\"><a href=\"/opinion/112466/pension-benefit-guaranty-corporation-v-ltv-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span> (1990).  Finally, nothing in the 1997 redeterminations violated any procedural requirements:  We have been pointed to nothing in the statute or regulations that requires any specific procedures before a priority is denied.
