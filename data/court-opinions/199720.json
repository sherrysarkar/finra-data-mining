This case presents, once again,\n\nsee Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 260 F.3d 54\n\n(1st Cir. 2001), the vexing question of how to interpret an\n\n\"advertising injury\" clause in a general commercial liability\n\n(\"GCL\") policy.     EKCO Housewares, Inc., a subsidiary of EKCO\n\nGroup, Inc. (collectively \"the EKCO companies\"), markets kitchen\n\nproducts, some of which it makes itself.          Among its products are\n\nmetal    tea   kettles,   which   are   sold   to    K-Mart,    a   large,\n\nindependent chain of retail stores.        In 1998, Chantal Cookware\n\nCorporation of Houston, Texas, brought suit in federal court in\n\nTexas against EKCO Housewares, K-Mart and others.                   Chantal\n\nCookware Corp. v. Vitrex Gourmet Corp., No. H-97-3978 (S.D. Tex.\n\n1998).\n\n           The   complaint   in   the   Chantal    case,   as   ultimately\n\namended, charged that the EKCO tea kettle (its \"Royale\" 2.5\n\nquart kettle) resembled in design and ornament Chantal's best\n\nselling tea kettle (its \"Classic\" 2.5 quart kettle) and that the\n\ndefendants were    liable for trade dress infringement and unfair\n\ncompetition under both the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)\n\n(1994), and state law, and for infringement of a design patent\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fcovering Chantal's kettle, 35 U.S.C. § 271 (1994 & Supp. V\n\n1999).   Chantal said that EKCO had deliberately copied the well\n\nknown design, features, and packaging of Chantal's tea kettle,\n\nthat the EKCO version was a low quality replica, and that the\n\nproduction and sale of the EKCO tea kettle had damaged Chantal.\n\n          Travelers Indemnity Company of Illinois (\"Travelers\")\n\nhad insured EKCO Group and EKCO Housewares under GCL policies\n\ncovering successive time periods from 1993 to 1997.           The EKCO\n\ncompanies notified Travelers of the Chantal lawsuit, asserting\n\nthat Travelers was obligated to defend and indemnify.         Although\n\nthe Travelers policies provided various coverages, the provision\n\ninvoked by the EKCO companies insured them against liability\n\nfor, and promised to defend suits based upon, \"advertising\n\ninjury   caused   by   an   offense   committed   in   the   course   of\n\nadvertising your goods, products or services.\"          This coverage\n\nwas subject to several limitations.         The policy defined the\n\nphrase \"advertising injury\" as follows:\n\n          1. \"Advertising injury\" means injury arising\n          out of one or more of the following\n          offenses:\n\n                  a. Oral or written publication\n                  of material that slanders or\n                  libels     a     person     or\n                  organization or disparages a\n                  person's   or   organization's\n                  goods, products or services;\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f                 b. Oral or written publication\n                 of material that violates a\n                 person's right of privacy;\n\n                 c.     Misappropriation    of\n                 advertising ideas or style of\n                 doing business; or\n\n                 d. Infringement of copyright,\n                 title or slogan.\n\n         Travelers refused to defend, and the EKCO companies\n\nthereupon brought suit against Travelers in New Hampshire state\n\ncourt seeking a declaration that Travelers was obligated to\n\ndefend the Chantal lawsuit.   EKCO Group, which had purchased the\n\npolicies for itself and affiliated companies, has ties with New\n\nHampshire.   Travelers removed the case to federal district court\n\nin New Hampshire, claiming jurisdiction based on diversity of\n\ncitizenship.   28 U.S.C. § 1332.   Thereafter, the Chantal lawsuit\n\nwas settled.   The EKCO companies hope to recover their defense\n\ncosts and amounts paid in settlement.\n\n         In the federal action, both sides moved for summary\n\njudgment, and on November 29, 2000, the district court filed a\n\ndecision in favor of the EKCO companies.   Applying New Hampshire\n\nlaw to construction of the policy, the district court held inter\n\nalia that the trade dress and unfair competition claims made by\n\nChantal against EKCO Housewares fell within the policy coverage\n\nfor advertising injury, that the injuries were caused by an\n\n\n\n                               -4-\n\foffense committed in the course of advertising EKCO's goods, and\n\nthat certain exclusions relied upon by Travelers did not apply.\n\n             Travelers appealed to this court.                Thereafter,       the\n\nEKCO companies filed a motion, joined by Travelers, to dismiss\n\nEKCO   Housewares    as    a     party-plaintiff;       the    purpose    was    to\n\npreserve federal jurisdiction, it having become clear belatedly\n\nthat   EKCO     Housewares,        like     Travelers,        is   an    Illinois\n\ncorporation.        EKCO    Group    is     a   proper    plaintiff,       having\n\ncontracted for the policies in question, and both sides have\n\nstipulated that rulings as to EKCO Group's rights will control\n\nas to EKCO Housewares despite its dismissal.                  Precedent permits\n\nus to grant the requested motion, Newman-Green, Inc. v. Alfonzo-\n\nLarrain, 490 U.S. 826, 833 (1989), and we now do so.\n\n             Turning to the merits, we note that the parties agree\n\nthat   New   Hampshire     law    controls      the   interpretation      of    the\n\npolicies.     This position is colorable (EKCO Group had its main\n\noffice there when it contracted for coverage), so we accept it,\n\nMerchants Ins. Co. of N.H., Inc. v. U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co., 143\n\nF.3d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1998), observing that the pertinent precepts\n\nof New Hampshire law appear much like those of other states.\n\nBecause the interpretation of the insurance policy in this case\n\npresents a question of law, see Ross v. Home Ins. Co., 773 A.2d\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f654, 656 (N.H. 2001), we review the district court's ruling and\n\nconstrue the policy de novo.\n\n             Needless to say, the advertising injury provision is,\n\nat least in certain applications, unclear and has provoked a\n\ngood deal of litigation.       E.g., Liberty, 260 F.3d at 54.                New\n\nHampshire, like most states, tends to favor the insured where\n\nthe policy is genuinely ambiguous and the choice is between two\n\nplausible readings, one providing coverage and the other not.\n\nFed. Bake Shop v. Farmington Cas. Co., 736 A.2d 459, 460 (N.H.\n\n1999).   But plausibility is a matter of degree, and a policy may\n\nbe unclear in some respects and clear enough in others.\n\n             In this case, under the plain terms of the policy there\n\nis coverage only if two different conditions are satisfied.\n\nFirst, there must be injury \"arising out of\" a defined offense;\n\nhere   the   only   listed   offense   claimed     by   EKCO    Group   to    be\n\napplicable is \"[m]isappropriation of advertising ideas or style\n\nof doing business.\"       Second, the offense in question \"must be\n\ncommitted in the course of advertising your [the insured's]\n\ngoods,   products    or   services.\"     As   we    shall      see,   the    two\n\nprovisions cannot be construed wholly in isolation from one\n\nanother.\n\n             It is by no means impossible, by piecing together\n\ndictionary definitions, to read the policy language in question\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fto provide coverage here for the EKCO companies.            This is\n\neasiest to do (and most defensible) for the first part of the\n\npertinent    offense   definition--the   term   \"misappropriation\"--\n\nalthough even here the coverage might be debated.        This is so\n\nbecause it is not easy to match Chantal's claims to whatever\n\nremains of the evanescent common law tort so labeled (EKCO does\n\nnot even try), and it is uncertain whether the policy used the\n\nterm in a generic sense.\n\n            There is no general common law rule against using the\n\nideas, inventions and practices of others, absent deception or\n\nwrongful acquisition.     See Prosser & Keeton on Torts 1020-22\n\n(5th ed. 1984).    Rather, the label \"misappropriation\" has been\n\nused to describe a judicially created tort where, in narrow\n\ncategories or for special reasons, common law protection has\n\nbeen given to a few intangibles.1      Chantal's design patent claim\n\nis statutory, and its trade dress claim would more commonly be\n\ndescribed in common-law jargon as \"passing off,\" \"trademark\" or\n\n\"unfair competition.\"\n\n\n    1 The classic case is Int'l News Serv. v. Assoc. Press, 748\nU.S. 215 (1918), now obsolete as a federal doctrine but possibly\nstill available under state law in unusual cases.          Nat'l\nBasketball Ass'n v. Motorola, Inc., 105 F.3d 841, 845 (2d Cir.\n1997). Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition § 38 cmt. c,\nat 412 (1995); id. reporters' note cmts. a and b. The original\nRestatement of Torts did not use the term, and the Restatement\nof Unfair Competition uses it only generically to encompass\ntrade secret law and right of publicity.\n\n                                 -7-\n\f           Alternatively, the policy reference to misappropriation\n\nmight be read not as a technical legal reference but generically\n\nto include any tort, statutory or otherwise, for which wrongful\n\nacquisition is an element.         Both trade dress and design patent\n\nsuits are based in part on wrongful appropriation in this latter\n\nsense.         If     everything     turned   on     the    reference      to\n\n\"misappropriation,\" the canon that policies be construed in\n\nfavor of the insured might resolve the case for EKCO, Fed. Bake\n\nShop,    736   A.2d    at   460,   although   this   is    not   a   foregone\n\nconclusion.2\n\n           The other part of the offense definition--that the\n\nmisappropriation be of an advertising idea or style of doing\n\nbusiness--is harder to satisfy, but perhaps not linguistically\n\nimpossible.         To call a real teapot intended for sale as a\n\nkitchen utensil an \"advertising idea\" is not a natural usage:\n\nthe phrase refers more readily to an advertising concept or plan\n\nfor an advertising campaign (both of which could indeed be\n\n\n\n    2 Other circuits have viewed the omission of specific\nreferences (e.g., to trademark) as precluding coverage. Callas\nEnters., Inc. v. Travelers Indem. Co. of Am., 193 F.3d 952, 956-\n57 (8th Cir. 1999); ShoLodge, Inc. v. Travelers Indem. Co. of\nIll., 168 F.3d 256, 260 (6th Cir. 1999); Advance Watch Co., Ltd\nv. Kemper Nat'l Ins. Co., 99 F.3d 795, 806 (6th Cir. 1996)\n(product itself not \"advertising\"). See also Curtis-Universal\nv. Sheboygan Emergency Med. Serv., Inc., 43 F.3d 1119, 1123 (7th\nCir. 1994) (refusing to construe \"unfair competition\" in its\nbroadest sense in predecessor policy).\n\n                                     -8-\n\fmisappropriated).     And \"style of doing business\" seems even more\n\nremote to the teapot; the phrase is commonly used, in the legal\n\ncontext, to refer to a theme or motif of packaging of products\n\nor of the business venue itself, such as the Mexican restaurant\n\ndecor involved in Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc., 505 U.S.\n\n763 (1992).\n\n            Still, a distinctively designed teapot could, assuming\n\nsecondary meaning, be seen as both a concrete product and as an\n\ninsignia triggering a favorable association in the public's mind\n\nwith the manufacturer, just as an ordinary trademark device or\n\nname might do.     I.P. Lund Trading ApS & Kronin, Inc. v. Kohler\n\nCo., 163 F.3d 27, 51-52 (1st Cir. 1998) (concurring opinion).\n\nTo this extent the physical teapot itself might be deemed to\n\nfunction as an \"advertising idea\" for Chantal.            The district\n\ncourt took this view and then, by a kind of substitution, deemed\n\nEKCO Housewares's         production and sale of the same teapot to\n\nsatisfy     the   other     requirement   of   the   policy--that   the\n\nmisappropriation be \"committed in the course of advertising your\n\n[EKCO's] goods, products or services.\"\n\n            This approach to construing the policy presents three\n\nproblems.     The first is that it requires      one to read at least\n\nsome of the policy language unnaturally.        Yes, EKCO's production\n\nand sale of the teapot could be described as \"advertising . . .\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f[EKCO's         teapot]\"    in    at    least    two   different     senses:     in    the\n\ntechnical sense that the teapot itself might--assuming secondary\n\nmeaning, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Samara Bros., Inc., 529 U.S.\n\n205, 216 (2000)--falsely suggest that Chantal was the source,\n\nand in the banal sense that every product displayed or depicted\n\nis an advertisement for itself and its obvious features.                         But to\n\ndescribe this case of product copying as a case about EKCO's\n\nadvertising is surely a very strained way to speak.\n\n                 Although    the       term    \"advertising\"       has   a     range    of\n\nmeanings,         the one that leaps to mind in reading this policy is\n\nwhat       is    surely     the    most       common   use:   as    a    reference     to\n\nadvertising in newspaper, radio, television or other familiar\n\nmedia where the advertisement is an activity or item distinct\n\nfrom the product being advertised.                     This is so even though, as\n\nthe district court pointed out, the dictionary also permits the\n\nterm \"advertising\" to be used, with equal legitimacy in the eyes\n\nof     lexicographers,            to    mean     any   form   of    \"calling     public\n\nattention\" to something else ( e.g., her tan was an advertisement\n\nfor    summer       vacations;         his     athletic   ability,       for   vigorous\n\nexercise, etc.).3\n\n\n       3\n     The Random House Dictionary of the English Language 29 (2d\ned. 1987) (\"The act or practice of calling public attention to\none's product . . . esp. by paid announcement in newspapers,\nover radio or television, on billboards, etc.\"); The American\nHeritage Dictionary 82 (2d ed. 1992) (\"The action of attracting\n\n                                               -10-\n\f            The second problem with the approach in this case is\n\nthat it is a slippery slope to unacceptable outcomes.               Imagine\n\nthat Chantal's claim was not for trade dress but solely based on\n\na design or utility patent, say, because EKCO had copied a\n\nChantal electric tea kettle shaped like a furnace that boiled\n\nwater in 15 seconds.          Certainly, the EKCO tea kettle itself\n\ncould    still   be   described   as    \"advertising\"--in    the   \"calling\n\npublic    attention     to\"   sense--its     own   evocative   design    or\n\ntechnical prowess; but linguistic awkwardness aside, surely no\n\none imagines that a policy covering \"advertising injury\" was\n\nintended to provide coverage for ordinary patent violations.\n\nSee St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Advanced Intercontinental\n\nSys., Inc., 824 F. Supp. 583, 586 (E.D. Va. 1993), aff'd, 21\n\nF.3d 424 (4th Cir. 1994).\n\n            Coverage on the present facts requires that one stretch\n\nthe term \"advertising\" in a way that has no natural stopping\n\npoint short of absurd results.           The obvious remedy is to read\n\nthe term both in the coverage and definitional provisions to\n\nrefer to conventional advertising--something separate from the\n\nproduct--which also happens to be the term's most familiar\n\nusage.      So   to   restrict    the    term   does   not   banish   every\n\n\npublic attention to a product or business.\"); Black's                   Law\nDictionary 55 (7th ed. 1999) (\"The action of drawing                    the\npublic's attention to something to promote its sale.\").\n\n                                   -11-\n\funcertainty--such       as     whether     a     one-off    prospectus       or     a\n\nsalesman's oral pitch is \"advertising,\" see Liberty, 260 F.3d at\n\n64-66--but does avoid impossible applications.\n\n           Finally,     this    narrower       reading     coheres   with    other\n\nlanguage    in    the    same     two     provisions--the         coverage        and\n\ndefinitional paragraphs.          To speak of \"the course of advertising\n\nyour goods\" suggests some distinction between producing and\n\nselling the goods on the one hand and \"advertising\" them on the\n\nother; and all of the definitions of covered offenses apart from\n\n\"misappropriation\" make clear (in two cases) or imply (in the\n\nlast)    that    the    drafter     had     in      mind   something      akin     to\n\nconventional     advertising       (\"oral      or    written     publication       of\n\nmaterial\" causing libel or invasion of privacy; infringement of\n\ncopyright, title, or slogan).\n\n           In the end, we are left to choose between two different\n\nconcepts of \"advertising\":              the familiar bundle of business\n\nactivities associated with that term and the far broader concept\n\nof inviting public attention, deliberately or not and by any\n\nmeans.     Although     the    bare     language      of   the   policy    is     not\n\nconclusive, the more natural reading and the only one that\n\navoids outlandish results is the former.                   It is worth adding\n\nthat if the latter, open-ended definition were employed, it is\n\n\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fhard to see how an insurer could even begin to calculate risks\n\nand set premiums.\n\n              Problems of application arise in insurance cases about\n\nwhich neither side has ever thought.         And in those cases, if the\n\npolicy language is unclear, the answer is not automatically to\n\ninclude or exclude but instead to use the \"construe against\"\n\ncanon to help choose among reasonable readings.                   Taking this\n\npolicy as a whole, only the conventional reading of the term\n\n\"advertising\" is reasonable, even if it too is blurred at the\n\nedges.\n\n              On appeal, EKCO says briefly that it did advertise the\n\nRoyale   in    the   conventional   sense   as    well:    it    depicted   its\n\nteapot, for example, in a printed brochure and in its 1997\n\nannual report.       But here EKCO has shifted ground as to just what\n\nit regards as the \"misappropriation\" charged by Chantal and\n\nignored the policy requirement that the defined offense--here,\n\nallegedly misappropriation of advertising ideas or style of\n\ndoing    business--be    \"committed   in    the   course    of    advertising\n\n[EKCO's] goods . . . .\"         Put differently, there must be some\n\ncausal    connection     running    from    the    offense       through    the\n\nadvertising to the injury.4\n\n\n    4Bank of the West v.

The misappropriation offenses charged by Chantal\n\nin its complaint were the physical reproduction and sale of a\n\nlook-alike teapot by EKCO.    That physical reproduction and sale\n\nwere not done \"in the course of\" making brochures or annual\n\nreports.   The latter is advertising, to be sure, but not where\n\nthe offenses charged by Chantal occurred.\n\n           In 1998--after the events in this case--the insurer\n\norganization that drafts standard form language for insurers to\n\nuse altered the provisions that relate to advertising injury.\n\nSee generally In re Ins. Antitrust Litig., 938 F.2d 919 (9th\n\nCir. 1991).     The new language (which Travelers may or may not\n\nhave adopted) does provide coverage for infringement of trade\n\ndress in \"your advertisement\" as well as copyright violation or\n\nmisappropriation in advertising; but the changed language also\n\nexpressly defines \"advertisement\" as \"a notice that is broadcast\n\n\n\n\n(M.D. Fla. 1988), aff'd, 868 F.2d 1274 (11th Cir. 1989); A.\nMeyers & Sons Corp. v.

Where a\n\ndefendant in a trip-and-fall case makes expensive repairs to the\n\npremises   before    trial,   it       may   or   may   not   (depending   on\n\ncircumstances) be reasonable to infer that the defendant thought\n\nthe prior state of the premises unsafe (although doubt about the\n\nstrength of this inference is one reason why such evidence may\n\nbe barred, see Fed. R. Evid. 407 & advisory committee's notes.)\n\nBut expression can always be made clearer and to change language\n\nin   a   policy     is   simply    a     precaution     against   recurrent\n\nmisunderstanding.\n\n           We have not discussed the case law at any length\n\nbecause there are no New Hampshire cases directly in point and\n\nthose from other courts are divided.6             It is true that the two\n\n\n     5\n     Insurance   Service   Office,  Inc.,   Commercial   General\nLiability Coverage Form (1999) CG 00 01 07 98, § 5, reprinted in\n1 International Risk Management Institute, Inc., Commercial\nLiability Insurance, IV.T.150 (Supp. 2001)\n     6Compare Bay Elec.

Ins. Co. v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 260 F.3d 54 (1st Cir. 2001), the vexing question of how to interpret an \"advertising injury\" clause in a general commercial liability (\"GCL\") policy. EKCO Housewares, Inc., a subsidiary of EKCO Group, Inc. (collectively \"the EKCO companies\"), markets kitchen products, some of which it makes itself. Among its products are metal tea kettles, which are sold to K-Mart, a large, independent chain of retail stores. In 1998, Chantal Cookware Corporation of Houston, Texas, brought suit in federal court in Texas against EKCO Housewares, K-Mart and others. Chantal Cookware Corp. v. Vitrex Gourmet Corp., No. H-97-3978 (S.D. Tex. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint in the Chantal case, as ultimately amended, charged that the EKCO tea kettle (its \"Royale\" 2.5 quart kettle) resembled in design and ornament Chantal's best selling tea kettle (its \"Classic\" 2.5 quart kettle) and that the defendants were liable for trade dress infringement and unfair competition under both the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(a) (1994), and state law, and for infringement of a design patent covering Chantal's kettle, 35 U.S.C. &#167; 271 (1994 &amp; Supp. V 1999). Chantal said that EKCO had deliberately copied the well known design, features, and packaging of Chantal's tea kettle, that the EKCO version was a low quality replica, and that the production and sale of the EKCO tea kettle had damaged Chantal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Travelers Indemnity Company of Illinois (\"Travelers\") had insured EKCO Group and EKCO Housewares under GCL policies covering successive time periods from 1993 to 1997. The EKCO companies notified Travelers of the Chantal lawsuit, asserting that Travelers was obligated to defend and indemnify. Although the Travelers policies provided various coverages, the provision invoked by the EKCO companies insured them against liability for, and promised to defend suits based upon, \"advertising injury caused by an offense committed in the course of advertising your goods, products or services.\" This coverage was subject to several limitations. The policy defined the phrase \"advertising injury\" as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. \"Advertising injury\" means injury arising out of one or more of the following offenses:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. Oral or written publication of material that slanders or libels a person or organization or disparages a person's or organization's goods, products or services;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. Oral or written publication of material that violates a person's right of privacy;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. Misappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">d. Infringement of copyright, title or slogan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Travelers refused to defend, and the EKCO companies thereupon brought suit against Travelers in New Hampshire state court seeking a declaration that Travelers was obligated to defend the Chantal lawsuit. EKCO Group, which had purchased the policies for itself and affiliated companies, has ties with New Hampshire. Travelers removed the case to federal district court in New Hampshire, claiming jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332. Thereafter, the Chantal lawsuit was settled. The EKCO companies hope to recover their defense costs and amounts paid in settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the federal action, both sides moved for summary judgment, and on November 29, 2000, the district court filed a decision in favor of the EKCO companies. Applying New Hampshire law to construction of the policy, the district court held inter alia that the trade dress and unfair competition claims made by Chantal against EKCO Housewares fell within the policy coverage for advertising injury, that the injuries were caused by an offense committed in the course of advertising EKCO's goods, and that certain exclusions relied upon by Travelers did not apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Travelers appealed to this court. Thereafter, the EKCO companies filed a motion, joined by Travelers, to dismiss EKCO Housewares as a party-plaintiff; the purpose was to preserve federal jurisdiction, it having become clear belatedly that EKCO Housewares, like Travelers, is an Illinois corporation. EKCO Group is a proper plaintiff, having contracted for the policies in question, and both sides have stipulated that rulings as to EKCO Group's rights will control as to EKCO Housewares despite its dismissal. Precedent permits us to grant the requested motion, Newman-Green, Inc. v. Alfonzo-Larrain, 490 U.S. 826, 833 (1989), and we now do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the merits, we note that the parties agree that New Hampshire law controls the interpretation of the policies. This position is colorable (EKCO Group had its main office there when it contracted for coverage), so we accept it, Merchants Ins. Co. of N.H., Inc. v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., 143 F.3d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1998), observing that the pertinent precepts of New Hampshire law appear much like those of other states. Because the interpretation of the insurance policy in this case presents a question of law, see Ross v. Home Ins. Co., 773 A.2d 654, 656 (N.H. 2001), we review the district court's ruling and construe the policy de novo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Needless to say, the advertising injury provision is, at least in certain applications, unclear and has provoked a good deal of litigation. E.g., Liberty, 260 F.3d at 54. New Hampshire, like most states, tends to favor the insured where the policy is genuinely ambiguous and the choice is between two plausible readings, one providing coverage and the other not. Fed. Bake Shop v. Farmington Cas. Co., 736 A.2d 459, 460 (N.H. 1999). But plausibility is a matter of degree, and a policy may be unclear in some respects and clear enough in others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, under the plain terms of the policy there is coverage only if two different conditions are satisfied. First, there must be injury \"arising out of\" a defined offense; here the only listed offense claimed by EKCO Group to be applicable is \"[m]isappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business.\" Second, the offense in question \"must be committed in the course of advertising your [the insured's] goods, products or services.\" As we shall see, the two provisions cannot be construed wholly in isolation from one another.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is by no means impossible, by piecing together dictionary definitions, to read the policy language in question to provide coverage here for the EKCO companies. This is easiest to do (and most defensible) for the first part of the pertinent offense definition--the term \"misappropriation\"--although even here the coverage might be debated. This is so because it is not easy to match Chantal's claims to whatever remains of the evanescent common law tort so labeled (EKCO does not even try), and it is uncertain whether the policy used the term in a generic sense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no general common law rule against using the ideas, inventions and practices of others, absent deception or wrongful acquisition. See Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts 1020-22 (5th ed. 1984). Rather, the label \"misappropriation\" has been used to describe a judicially created tort where, in narrow categories or for special reasons, common law protection has been given to a few intangibles.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Chantal's design patent claim is statutory, and its trade dress claim would more commonly be described in common-law jargon as \"passing off,\" \"trademark\" or \"unfair competition.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, the policy reference to misappropriation might be read not as a technical legal reference but generically to include any tort, statutory or otherwise, for which wrongful acquisition is an element. Both trade dress and design patent suits are based in part on wrongful appropriation in this latter sense. If everything turned on the reference to \"misappropriation,\" the canon that policies be construed in favor of the insured might resolve the case for EKCO, Fed. Bake Shop, 736 A.2d at 460, although this is not a foregone conclusion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other part of the offense definition--that the misappropriation be of an advertising idea or style of doing business--is harder to satisfy, but perhaps not linguistically impossible. To call a real teapot intended for sale as a kitchen utensil an \"advertising idea\" is not a natural usage: the phrase refers more readily to an advertising concept or plan for an advertising campaign (both of which could indeed be misappropriated). And \"style of doing business\" seems even more remote to the teapot; the phrase is commonly used, in the legal context, to refer to a theme or motif of packaging of products or of the business venue itself, such as the Mexican restaurant decor involved in Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc., 505 U.S. 763 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, a distinctively designed teapot could, assuming secondary meaning, be seen as both a concrete product and as an insignia triggering a favorable association in the public's mind with the manufacturer, just as an ordinary trademark device or name might do. I.P. Lund Trading ApS &amp; Kronin, Inc. v. Kohler Co., 163 F.3d 27, 51-52 (1st Cir. 1998) (concurring opinion). To this extent the physical teapot itself might be deemed to function as an \"advertising idea\" for Chantal. The district court took this view and then, by a kind of substitution, deemed EKCO Housewares's production and sale of the same teapot to satisfy the other requirement of the policy--that the misappropriation be \"committed in the course of advertising your [EKCO's] goods, products or services.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This approach to construing the policy presents three problems. The first is that it requires one to read at least some of the policy language unnaturally. Yes, EKCO's production and sale of the teapot could be described as \"advertising . . . [EKCO's teapot]\" in at least two different senses: in the technical sense that the teapot itself might--assuming secondary meaning, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Samara Bros., Inc., 529 U.S. 205, 216 (2000)--falsely suggest that Chantal was the source, and in the banal sense that every product displayed or depicted is an advertisement for itself and its obvious features. But to describe this case of product copying as a case about EKCO's advertising is surely a very strained way to speak.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the term \"advertising\" has a range of meanings, the one that leaps to mind in reading this policy is what is surely the most common use: as a reference to advertising in newspaper, radio, television or other familiar media where the advertisement is an activity or item distinct from the product being advertised. This is so even though, as the district court pointed out, the dictionary also permits the term \"advertising\" to be used, with equal legitimacy in the eyes of lexicographers, to mean any form of \"calling public attention\" to something else (e.g., her tan was an advertisement for summer vacations; his athletic ability, for vigorous exercise, etc.).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second problem with the approach in this case is that it is a slippery slope to unacceptable outcomes. Imagine that Chantal's claim was not for trade dress but solely based on a design or utility patent, say, because EKCO had copied a Chantal electric tea kettle shaped like a furnace that boiled water in 15 seconds. Certainly, the EKCO tea kettle itself could still be described as \"advertising\"--in the \"calling public attention to\" sense--its own evocative design or technical prowess; but linguistic awkwardness aside, surely no one imagines that a policy covering \"advertising injury\" was intended to provide coverage for ordinary patent violations. See St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Advanced Intercontinental Sys., Inc., 824 F. Supp. 583, 586 (E.D. Va. 1993), aff'd, 21 F.3d 424 (4th Cir. 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coverage on the present facts requires that one stretch the term \"advertising\" in a way that has no natural stopping point short of absurd results. The obvious remedy is to read the term both in the coverage and definitional provisions to refer to conventional advertising--something separate from the product--which also happens to be the term's most familiar usage. So to restrict the term does not banish every uncertainty--such as whether a one-off prospectus or a salesman's oral pitch is \"advertising,\" see Liberty, 260 F.3d at 64-66--but does avoid impossible applications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, this narrower reading coheres with other language in the same two provisions--the coverage and definitional paragraphs. To speak of \"the course of advertising your goods\" suggests some distinction between producing and selling the goods on the one hand and \"advertising\" them on the other; and all of the definitions of covered offenses apart from \"misappropriation\" make clear (in two cases) or imply (in the last) that the drafter had in mind something akin to conventional advertising (\"oral or written publication of material\" causing libel or invasion of privacy; infringement of copyright, title, or slogan).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, we are left to choose between two different concepts of \"advertising\": the familiar bundle of business activities associated with that term and the far broader concept of inviting public attention, deliberately or not and by any means. Although the bare language of the policy is not conclusive, the more natural reading and the only one that avoids outlandish results is the former. It is worth adding that if the latter, open-ended definition were employed, it is hard to see how an insurer could even begin to calculate risks and set premiums.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Problems of application arise in insurance cases about which neither side has ever thought. And in those cases, if the policy language is unclear, the answer is not automatically to include or exclude but instead to use the \"construe against\" canon to help choose among reasonable readings. Taking this policy as a whole, only the conventional reading of the term \"advertising\" is reasonable, even if it too is blurred at the edges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, EKCO says briefly that it did advertise the Royale in the conventional sense as well: it depicted its teapot, for example, in a printed brochure and in its 1997 annual report. But here EKCO has shifted ground as to just what it regards as the \"misappropriation\" charged by Chantal and ignored the policy requirement that the defined offense--here, allegedly misappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business--be \"committed in the course of advertising [EKCO's] goods . . . .\" Put differently, there must be some causal connection running from the offense through the advertising to the injury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the Chantal complaint suggests that it was concerned with EKCO's design of its brochures or annual reports or that the graphics or typography were invented by or borrowed from Chantal. The misappropriation offenses charged by Chantal in its complaint were the physical reproduction and sale of a look-alike teapot by EKCO. That physical reproduction and sale were not done \"in the course of\" making brochures or annual reports. The latter is advertising, to be sure, but not where the offenses charged by Chantal occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1998--after the events in this case--the insurer organization that drafts standard form language for insurers to use altered the provisions that relate to advertising injury. See generally In re Ins. Antitrust Litig., 938 F.2d 919 (9th Cir. 1991). The new language (which Travelers may or may not have adopted) does provide coverage for infringement of trade dress in \"your advertisement\" as well as copyright violation or misappropriation in advertising; but the changed language also expressly defines \"advertisement\" as \"a notice that is broadcast or published to the general public or specific market segments about your good, products, or services . . . .\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">EKCO mentions this 1998 change, suggesting that the narrowed definition contrasts with the prior language. Where a defendant in a trip-and-fall case makes expensive repairs to the premises before trial, it may or may not (depending on circumstances) be reasonable to infer that the defendant thought the prior state of the premises unsafe (although doubt about the strength of this inference is one reason why such evidence may be barred, see Fed. R. Evid. 407 &amp; advisory committee's notes.) But expression can always be made clearer and to change language in a policy is simply a precaution against recurrent misunderstanding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have not discussed the case law at any length because there are no New Hampshire cases directly in point and those from other courts are divided.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> It is true that the two circuit courts construing such policies favor Travelers, see note 1, above, but their reasoning is different from our own. In particular, the Sixth Circuit's categorical approach in Sho Lodge, 168 F.3d at 260, might seem to exclude any possibility of advertising injury based on a trademark or trade dress violation. By contrast, we can ourselves imagine a possible claim if, in the course of a published advertisement, a rival's trademarked insignia were misappropriated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are a host of difficult questions that the policy, at least in its present form, could present. What happens when there is conventional advertising in an unconventional medium (e.g., an advertisement for some other product on t-shirts or ballpoint pens); and how should one analyze a claim directed to the appearance of a pirated trademark depicted in a newspaper advertisement where the harm flows directly from the publication? Such variations, however, need not be addressed in order to resolve the present case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The motion to dismiss EKCO Housewares is granted, and the judgment of the district court is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. That our own view differs from the very thoughtful opinion of the district judge in this case merely underscores that the issue is a difficult one, which we are obliged to decide de novo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The classic case is Int'l News Serv. v.

EKCO Housewares, Inc., a subsidiary of EKCO Group, Inc. (collectively \"the EKCO companies\"), markets kitchen products, some of which it makes itself. Among its products are metal tea kettles, which are sold to K-Mart, a large, independent chain of retail stores. In 1998, Chantal Cookware Corporation of Houston, Texas, brought suit in federal court in Texas against EKCO Housewares, K-Mart and others. Chantal Cookware Corp. v. Vitrex Gourmet Corp., No. H-97-3978 (S.D. Tex. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint in the Chantal case, as ultimately amended, charged that the EKCO tea kettle (its \"Royale\" 2.5 quart kettle) resembled in design and ornament Chantal's best selling tea kettle (its \"Classic\" 2.5 quart kettle) and that the defendants were liable for trade dress infringement and unfair competition under both the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(a) (1994), and state law, and for infringement of a design patent covering Chantal's kettle, 35 U.S.C. &#167; 271 (1994 &amp; Supp. V 1999). Chantal said that EKCO had deliberately copied the well known design, features, and packaging of Chantal's tea kettle, that the EKCO version was a low quality replica, and that the production and sale of the EKCO tea kettle had damaged Chantal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Travelers Indemnity Company of Illinois (\"Travelers\") had insured EKCO Group and EKCO Housewares under GCL policies covering successive time periods from 1993 to 1997. The EKCO companies notified Travelers of the Chantal lawsuit, asserting that Travelers was obligated to defend and indemnify. Although the Travelers policies provided various coverages, the provision invoked by the EKCO companies insured them against liability for, and promised to defend suits based upon, \"advertising injury caused by an offense committed in the course of advertising your goods, products or services.\" This coverage was subject to several limitations. The policy defined the phrase \"advertising injury\" as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. \"Advertising injury\" means injury arising out of one or more of the following offenses:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. Oral or written publication of material that slanders or libels a person or organization or disparages a person's or organization's goods, products or services;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. Oral or written publication of material that violates a person's right of privacy;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. Misappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">d. Infringement of copyright, title or slogan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Travelers refused to defend, and the EKCO companies thereupon brought suit against Travelers in New Hampshire state court seeking a declaration that Travelers was obligated to defend the Chantal lawsuit. EKCO Group, which had purchased the policies for itself and affiliated companies, has ties with New Hampshire. Travelers removed the case to federal district court in New Hampshire, claiming jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332. Thereafter, the Chantal lawsuit was settled. The EKCO companies hope to recover their defense costs and amounts paid in settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the federal action, both sides moved for summary judgment, and on November 29, 2000, the district court filed a decision in favor of the EKCO companies. Applying New Hampshire law to construction of the policy, the district court held inter alia that the trade dress and unfair competition claims made by Chantal against EKCO Housewares fell within the policy coverage for advertising injury, that the injuries were caused by an offense committed in the course of advertising EKCO's goods, and that certain exclusions relied upon by Travelers did not apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Travelers appealed to this court. Thereafter, the EKCO companies filed a motion, joined by Travelers, to dismiss EKCO Housewares as a party-plaintiff; the purpose was to preserve federal jurisdiction, it having become clear belatedly that EKCO Housewares, like Travelers, is an Illinois corporation. EKCO Group is a proper plaintiff, having contracted for the policies in question, and both sides have stipulated that rulings as to EKCO Group's rights will control as to EKCO Housewares despite its dismissal. Precedent permits us to grant the requested motion, Newman-Green, Inc. v. Alfonzo-Larrain, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112278\"><a href=\"/opinion/112278/newman-green-inc-v-alfonzo-larrain/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">826</span></a></span>, 833 (1989), and we now do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the merits, we note that the parties agree that New Hampshire law controls the interpretation of the policies. This position is colorable (EKCO Group had its main office there when it contracted for coverage), so we accept it, Merchants Ins. Co. of N.H., Inc. v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197929\"><a href=\"/opinion/197929/merchants-insurance-v-guaranty-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir. 1998), observing that the pertinent precepts of New Hampshire law appear much like those of other states. Because the interpretation of the insurance policy in this case presents a question of law, see Ross v. Home Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">773</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">654</span></span>, 656 (N.H. 2001), we review the district court's ruling and construe the policy de novo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Needless to say, the advertising injury provision is, at least in certain applications, unclear and has provoked a good deal of litigation. E.g., Liberty, 260 F.3d at 54. New Hampshire, like most states, tends to favor the insured where the policy is genuinely ambiguous and the choice is between two plausible readings, one providing coverage and the other not. Fed. Bake Shop v. Farmington Cas. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">736</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">459</span></span>, 460 (N.H. 1999). But plausibility is a matter of degree, and a policy may be unclear in some respects and clear enough in others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, under the plain terms of the policy there is coverage only if two different conditions are satisfied. First, there must be injury \"arising out of\" a defined offense; here the only listed offense claimed by EKCO Group to be applicable is \"[m]isappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business.\" Second, the offense in question \"must be committed in the course of advertising your [the insured's] goods, products or services.\" As we shall see, the two provisions cannot be construed wholly in isolation from one another.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is by no means impossible, by piecing together dictionary definitions, to read the policy language in question to provide coverage here for the EKCO companies. This is easiest to do (and most defensible) for the first part of the pertinent offense definition--the term \"misappropriation\"--although even here the coverage might be debated. This is so because it is not easy to match Chantal's claims to whatever remains of the evanescent common law tort so labeled (EKCO does not even try), and it is uncertain whether the policy used the term in a generic sense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no general common law rule against using the ideas, inventions and practices of others, absent deception or wrongful acquisition. See Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts 1020-22 (5th ed. 1984). Rather, the label \"misappropriation\" has been used to describe a judicially created tort where, in narrow categories or for special reasons, common law protection has been given to a few intangibles.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Chantal's design patent claim is statutory, and its trade dress claim would more commonly be described in common-law jargon as \"passing off,\" \"trademark\" or \"unfair competition.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, the policy reference to misappropriation might be read not as a technical legal reference but generically to include any tort, statutory or otherwise, for which wrongful acquisition is an element. Both trade dress and design patent suits are based in part on wrongful appropriation in this latter sense. If everything turned on the reference to \"misappropriation,\" the canon that policies be construed in favor of the insured might resolve the case for EKCO, Fed. Bake Shop, 736 A.2d at 460, although this is not a foregone conclusion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other part of the offense definition--that the misappropriation be of an advertising idea or style of doing business--is harder to satisfy, but perhaps not linguistically impossible. To call a real teapot intended for sale as a kitchen utensil an \"advertising idea\" is not a natural usage: the phrase refers more readily to an advertising concept or plan for an advertising campaign (both of which could indeed be misappropriated). And \"style of doing business\" seems even more remote to the teapot; the phrase is commonly used, in the legal context, to refer to a theme or motif of packaging of products or of the business venue itself, such as the Mexican restaurant decor involved in Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112783\"><a href=\"/opinion/112783/two-pesos-inc-v-taco-cabana-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">763</span></a></span> (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, a distinctively designed teapot could, assuming secondary meaning, be seen as both a concrete product and as an insignia triggering a favorable association in the public's mind with the manufacturer, just as an ordinary trademark device or name might do. I.P. Lund Trading ApS &amp; Kronin, Inc. v. Kohler Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198254\"><a href=\"/opinion/198254/kroni-inc-v-kohler-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 51-52 (1st Cir. 1998) (concurring opinion). To this extent the physical teapot itself might be deemed to function as an \"advertising idea\" for Chantal. The district court took this view and then, by a kind of substitution, deemed EKCO Housewares's production and sale of the same teapot to satisfy the other requirement of the policy--that the misappropriation be \"committed in the course of advertising your [EKCO's] goods, products or services.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This approach to construing the policy presents three problems. The first is that it requires one to read at least some of the policy language unnaturally. Yes, EKCO's production and sale of the teapot could be described as \"advertising . . . [EKCO's teapot]\" in at least two different senses: in the technical sense that the teapot itself might--assuming secondary meaning, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Samara Bros., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118349\"><a href=\"/opinion/118349/wal-mart-stores-inc-v-samara-brothers-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">205</span></a></span>, 216 (2000)--falsely suggest that Chantal was the source, and in the banal sense that every product displayed or depicted is an advertisement for itself and its obvious features. But to describe this case of product copying as a case about EKCO's advertising is surely a very strained way to speak.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the term \"advertising\" has a range of meanings, the one that leaps to mind in reading this policy is what is surely the most common use: as a reference to advertising in newspaper, radio, television or other familiar media where the advertisement is an activity or item distinct from the product being advertised. This is so even though, as the district court pointed out, the dictionary also permits the term \"advertising\" to be used, with equal legitimacy in the eyes of lexicographers, to mean any form of \"calling public attention\" to something else (e.g., her tan was an advertisement for summer vacations; his athletic ability, for vigorous exercise, etc.).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second problem with the approach in this case is that it is a slippery slope to unacceptable outcomes. Imagine that Chantal's claim was not for trade dress but solely based on a design or utility patent, say, because EKCO had copied a Chantal electric tea kettle shaped like a furnace that boiled water in 15 seconds. Certainly, the EKCO tea kettle itself could still be described as \"advertising\"--in the \"calling public attention to\" sense--its own evocative design or technical prowess; but linguistic awkwardness aside, surely no one imagines that a policy covering \"advertising injury\" was intended to provide coverage for ordinary patent violations. See St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Advanced Intercontinental Sys., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1460410\"><a href=\"/opinion/1460410/st-paul-fire-marine-v-advanced-interventional/\"><span class=\"volume\">824</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">583</span></a></span>, 586 (E.D. Va. 1993), aff'd, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></span> (4th Cir. 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coverage on the present facts requires that one stretch the term \"advertising\" in a way that has no natural stopping point short of absurd results. The obvious remedy is to read the term both in the coverage and definitional provisions to refer to conventional advertising--something separate from the product--which also happens to be the term's most familiar usage. So to restrict the term does not banish every uncertainty--such as whether a one-off prospectus or a salesman's oral pitch is \"advertising,\" see Liberty, 260 F.3d at 64-66--but does avoid impossible applications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, this narrower reading coheres with other language in the same two provisions--the coverage and definitional paragraphs. To speak of \"the course of advertising your goods\" suggests some distinction between producing and selling the goods on the one hand and \"advertising\" them on the other; and all of the definitions of covered offenses apart from \"misappropriation\" make clear (in two cases) or imply (in the last) that the drafter had in mind something akin to conventional advertising (\"oral or written publication of material\" causing libel or invasion of privacy; infringement of copyright, title, or slogan).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, we are left to choose between two different concepts of \"advertising\": the familiar bundle of business activities associated with that term and the far broader concept of inviting public attention, deliberately or not and by any means. Although the bare language of the policy is not conclusive, the more natural reading and the only one that avoids outlandish results is the former. It is worth adding that if the latter, open-ended definition were employed, it is hard to see how an insurer could even begin to calculate risks and set premiums.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Problems of application arise in insurance cases about which neither side has ever thought. And in those cases, if the policy language is unclear, the answer is not automatically to include or exclude but instead to use the \"construe against\" canon to help choose among reasonable readings. Taking this policy as a whole, only the conventional reading of the term \"advertising\" is reasonable, even if it too is blurred at the edges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, EKCO says briefly that it did advertise the Royale in the conventional sense as well: it depicted its teapot, for example, in a printed brochure and in its 1997 annual report. But here EKCO has shifted ground as to just what it regards as the \"misappropriation\" charged by Chantal and ignored the policy requirement that the defined offense--here, allegedly misappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business--be \"committed in the course of advertising [EKCO's] goods . . . .\" Put differently, there must be some causal connection running from the offense through the advertising to the injury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the Chantal complaint suggests that it was concerned with EKCO's design of its brochures or annual reports or that the graphics or typography were invented by or borrowed from Chantal. The misappropriation offenses charged by Chantal in its complaint were the physical reproduction and sale of a look-alike teapot by EKCO. That physical reproduction and sale were not done \"in the course of\" making brochures or annual reports. The latter is advertising, to be sure, but not where the offenses charged by Chantal occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1998--after the events in this case--the insurer organization that drafts standard form language for insurers to use altered the provisions that relate to advertising injury. See generally In re Ins. Antitrust Litig., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564875\"><a href=\"/opinion/564875/in-re-insurance-antitrust-litigation-ace-check-cashing-inc-acme/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">919</span></a></span> (9th Cir. 1991). The new language (which Travelers may or may not have adopted) does provide coverage for infringement of trade dress in \"your advertisement\" as well as copyright violation or misappropriation in advertising; but the changed language also expressly defines \"advertisement\" as \"a notice that is broadcast or published to the general public or specific market segments about your good, products, or services . . . .\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">EKCO mentions this 1998 change, suggesting that the narrowed definition contrasts with the prior language. Where a defendant in a trip-and-fall case makes expensive repairs to the premises before trial, it may or may not (depending on circumstances) be reasonable to infer that the defendant thought the prior state of the premises unsafe (although doubt about the strength of this inference is one reason why such evidence may be barred, see Fed. R. Evid. 407 &amp; advisory committee's notes.) But expression can always be made clearer and to change language in a policy is simply a precaution against recurrent misunderstanding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have not discussed the case law at any length because there are no New Hampshire cases directly in point and those from other courts are divided.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> It is true that the two circuit courts construing such policies favor Travelers, see note 1, above, but their reasoning is different from our own. In particular, the Sixth Circuit's categorical approach in Sho Lodge, 168 F.3d at 260, might seem to exclude any possibility of advertising injury based on a trademark or trade dress violation. By contrast, we can ourselves imagine a possible claim if, in the course of a published advertisement, a rival's trademarked insignia were misappropriated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are a host of difficult questions that the policy, at least in its present form, could present. What happens when there is conventional advertising in an unconventional medium (e.g., an advertisement for some other product on t-shirts or ballpoint pens); and how should one analyze a claim directed to the appearance of a pirated trademark depicted in a newspaper advertisement where the harm flows directly from the publication? Such variations, however, need not be addressed in order to resolve the present case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The motion to dismiss EKCO Housewares is granted, and the judgment of the district court is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. That our own view differs from the very thoughtful opinion of the district judge in this case merely underscores that the issue is a difficult one, which we are obliged to decide de novo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The classic case is Int'l News Serv. v.
