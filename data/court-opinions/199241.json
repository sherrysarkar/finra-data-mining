Cohen, Senior Attorney, National Labor Relations Board,\nwith whom Leonard R. Page, General Counsel, National Labor Relations\nBoard, and Aileen A. Armstrong, Deputy Associate General Counsel,\nNational Labor Relations Board, were on brief, for Petitioner.\n     Kevin M. Keating for Respondent.\n\fJanuary 23, 2001\n\f          LYNCH, Circuit Judge.         In 1995 the Teamsters Union\n\nbegan an organizing campaign at North Atlantic Medical Services,\n\na supplier of medical equipment. North Atlantic fought fiercely\n\nand also unfairly and now has unfair labor practice findings\n\nagainst it, as well as a bargaining order.                 A supervisor,\n\nthough, had pro-union sympathies which he openly expressed. The\n\nemployees -- that is, a majority of them -- both signed union\n\nrepresentation cards and voted for unionization in an election.\n\nThe employer has refused to bargain with the Union and twice has\n\nbeen ordered by the National Labor Relations Board to do so.\n\nThe Board now petitions for enforcement of its various orders.\n\nNorth Atlantic also petitions for review, saying that both the\n\nelection and the authorization cards, and thus the consequent\n\nBoard   orders   to   bargain,   must   be   set   aside    because   the\n\nsupervisor’s conduct biased the outcome. North Atlantic has not\n\nchallenged the finding of unfair labor practices on its part.\n\nThe case involves review of the Board's determination that the\n\npro-union activities of a supervisor were not sufficient to\n\ndeprive employees of their right to a free and uncoerced choice,\n\nand thus to set aside the two bases for the bargaining order.\n\n                                  I.\n\n                                  -3-\n\f         We summarize the Administrative Law Judge's undisputed\n\nfindings of fact, adopted by the Board.\n\n         North   Atlantic   Medical    Services    supplies    medical\n\nequipment.   That   equipment   is    delivered   by   field   service\n\ntechnicians, or drivers.    In April 1995, when union organizing\n\nefforts began, North Atlantic employed approximately eleven\n\ndrivers and mechanics at its Leominster facility.\n\n         At the request of driver Marco Nagle, union organizer\n\nAl Stearns met on April 6, 1995, with Nagle and four other North\n\nAtlantic employees who were interested in unionization.1         Field\n\nService Manager Steven Custer also attended the meeting. Custer\n\nsaid he supported unionization but told the others that North\n\nAtlantic's president, Carbot Carabott, was adamantly opposed to\n\nunionization and had once threatened to \"lock the [ ] doors\" if\n\nthe employees tried to organize a union.          Custer warned that\n\nCarabott would \"do everything in his power to make it miserable\n\nfor everyone\" if they tried to organize.          All six attendees,\n\n\n\n    1     Stearns represented the International Brotherhood of\nTeamsters, AFL-CIO. We refer to the local, Truck Drivers Union\nLocal 3170, as \"the Union,\" either as the proposed\nrepresentative or as the certified representative of North\nAtlantic's drivers.\n\n                                -4-\n\fincluding Custer, signed union authorization cards at that\n\nmeeting. Custer did not himself pass out cards or ask employees\n\nto sign the cards, nor did he promise rewards if they supported\n\nunionization or punishment if they did not.\n\n           Shortly after the meeting, Nagle obtained signed cards\n\nfrom   three   more   employees.     When   Stearns   again   met   with\n\nemployees on April 13, eight of the eleven unit members had\n\nsigned cards.    Stearns filed a representation petition with the\n\nBoard.    The Board then sent a copy to North Atlantic on April\n\n17.    The parties agreed to an election set for June 1, 1995.\n\n           In the weeks before the election, North Atlantic\n\nlaunched a campaign to defeat unionization.            It undertook a\n\nseries of personnel actions designed to undermine support for\n\nunionization in the bargaining unit. Three days after receiving\n\nthe petition, on April 20, North Atlantic removed Gary Roy, a\n\nunion supporter who had signed an authorization card on April 6,\n\nfrom a light duty assignment and placed him on full worker's\n\ncompensation pending further investigation of his condition.\n\nNorth Atlantic fired Roy a month later on May 22.         Also on May\n\n22, North Atlantic laid off another driver in the unit, Marc\n\nKiroac, for \"lack of work,\" although Kiroac had worked over 60\n\n                                   -5-\n\fhours in each of the previous two weeks, and was recalled one\n\nweek after the election.           And on April 21, North Atlantic\n\ntransferred a salesman, Michael McDermott, a union opponent,\n\nback into the bargaining unit as a driver in order to dilute\n\nsupport for unionization.      McDermott did not want to transfer\n\nand told other drivers that he was eager for the election to be\n\nover so he could go back to his sales job.\n\n           President Carabott held two mandatory employee meetings\n\nto discuss his opposition to unionization.            At the meetings,\n\nCarabott questioned employees directly about their reasons for\n\nsupporting unionization, and told them they could work down the\n\nstreet if they wanted a union.        He also said that he would get\n\nout of the business when it stopped being \"fun,\" and spoke about\n\na friend's company that went out of business after employees\n\nchose unionization.      This was an implied threat that North\n\nAtlantic   would   go   out   of    business     if   the   drivers   won\n\nrepresentation rights.        Calling     the   unionization   effort   a\n\n\"battle in a war,\" Carabott said that he would not lose this\n\nwar.   He warned that unionization would be futile because there\n\nwould be no extra benefits even if the employees chose union\n\nrepresentation, and that although a union could offer anything,\n\n                                    -6-\n\fhe had the final say as to what would be given.           Carabott also\n\nannounced a new \"open door policy\" and solicited grievances from\n\nemployees, and implied that he would suspend that policy if\n\nemployees unionized.\n\n            North   Atlantic    also     distributed    two     anti-union\n\nmemoranda to employees shortly before the June 1 election.               In\n\nthe second memo, which accompanied paychecks, Carabott wrote\n\nthat unionization could \"endanger the financial stability of\n\nthis company and also the livelihood that enables you to provide\n\nfor your family\" because customers would be unlikely to continue\n\nto do business with a unionized company due to the threat of\n\nstrikes.      Carabott also warned that a strike \"means loss of\n\nbusiness and loss of jobs.\"\n\n            Meanwhile, on April 20, three days after it received\n\nthe representation petition, North Atlantic fired Field Service\n\nManager Custer, purportedly for failing to competently perform\n\nhis responsibilities as service manager.             The Union filed a\n\ndiscriminatory discharge charge on Custer's behalf on May 22.2\n\nThe   Union    argued   that   Custer    was   an   employee,    fired   in\n\n\n      2     That charge was still pending at the time of the\nelection.\n\n                                   -7-\n\fretaliation for his support of unionization.         Custer attended\n\nfour more union meetings before the June 1 election, but did not\n\npressure employees to support unionization.           He asked some\n\nemployees in general terms whether they planned to vote for the\n\nUnion, and told them that they should only do so if they were\n\n\"110 percent sure\" because President Carabott would fiercely\n\nresist unionization.   Custer also voted in the June 1 election.3\n\n          After the election, the Board held a hearing to resolve\n\nchallenges to several of the ballots.       The Board rejected North\n\nAtlantic's challenge to the Union's majority status based on\n\nCuster's pro-union activities.         Further, the Board found that\n\nNorth   Atlantic   committed   numerous    unfair   labor   practices,\n\nincluding firing several employees in retaliation for their\n\nunion support, making unilateral changes to evaluation and\n\ncompensation policies, threatening employees with job loss, and\n\ntelling employees that unionization was futile because having a\n\nunion would not result in improved benefits.\n\n\n\n\n    3     On July 22, Custer's discriminatory discharge claim was\ndismissed after a finding that Custer was a supervisor, not an\nemployee, and therefore was not protected by the Act from\ndischarge. That decision was not appealed.\n\n                                 -8-\n\f          In light of North Atlantic's unfair labor practices,\n\nthe   Board   concluded   that   a    remedial   bargaining   order   was\n\nwarranted, requiring North Atlantic to recognize and bargain\n\nwith the Union.\n\nThe Board ordered North Atlantic to cease and desist from the\n\nunfair labor practices and from interfering with or coercing\n\nemployees in the exercise of their rights under the Act.          North\n\nAtlantic was also required to offer reinstatement to the fired\n\nemployees and to compensate all employees for losses caused by\n\nits unfair labor practices.      Finally, the Board ruled that the\n\nremaining valid ballots were to be counted and, if the Union\n\nreceived a majority of the valid ballots, directed the Regional\n\nDirector to certify the Union as the employees' exclusive\n\nbargaining representative.4          The Board ordered the Regional\n\nDirector to set aside the election if the Union did not receive\n\na majority of the ballots cast.\n\n          The Union was certified after a revised tally revealed\n\nthat the Union indeed had won the election, by a count of eight\n\n\n      4   The record does not reveal the reason for the seeming\nanomaly of a bargaining order followed by an order to count\nballots.    It may be that the Board was simply providing\nalternative grounds, should one prove infirm on judicial review.\n\n                                     -9-\n\fto two.   But North Atlantic again refused the Union's request\n\nfor recognition and bargaining, claiming that the Union had been\n\nimproperly   certified   because   Custer's   pro-union   activities\n\ntainted the election, requiring it to be set aside.       Acting on\n\na Union complaint, the Board's General Counsel issued an unfair\n\nlabor practice complaint and the Board granted its motion for\n\nsummary judgment against North Atlantic.      The Board found that\n\nNorth Atlantic had not produced any new evidence or special\n\ncircumstances requiring the Board to alter its earlier decision\n\nthat Custer's activities did not taint the representation\n\nproceedings.   The Board concluded that North Atlantic's refusal\n\nto bargain with the Union violated the Act and again ordered\n\nNorth Atlantic to bargain with the Union and to cease and desist\n\nfrom interfering with, restraining, or coercing employees in the\n\nexercise of their rights under the Act.\n\n          In its petition for enforcement, the Board seeks\n\nsummary affirmance of its findings that North Atlantic committed\n\nseveral unfair labor practices, which North Atlantic does not\n\nchallenge on appeal. Further, the Board seeks affirmance of its\n\nfinding that the Union achieved a valid card majority which,\n\ncombined with the numerous unfair labor practices, led the Board\n\n                               -10-\n\fto certify the Union as the exclusive bargaining representative;\n\nthat certification formed the basis of the Board's remedial\n\nbargaining order and refusal to bargain unfair labor practices\n\nfinding in 1995.     The Board also requests affirmance of its\n\nfinding that North Atlantic violated the Act by refusing to\n\nbargain with the Union after it won the election and was again\n\ncertified as the exclusive bargaining agent in 1999.            North\n\nAtlantic seeks review of the Board's orders.\n\n                                 II.\n\n          The ultimate issue here is whether North Atlantic has\n\nan obligation to bargain with the Union, as ordered by the\n\nBoard.   There are two bases for the Board’s bargaining orders.\n\nFirst, there is a Gissel bargaining order, which provides a\n\nbasis for a bargaining order irrespective of the outcome of the\n\nelection because the Board found North Atlantic had committed\n\nmassive unfair labor practices, sufficient to render a fair\n\nelection improbable, and the Union had obtained an authorization\n\ncard majority. See NLRB v. Gissel Packaging Co., 395 U.S. 575, 600,\n\n610, 613 (1969) (Board can impose bargaining obligation on employer\n\nwhich refuses to recognize union that has obtained card majority and\n\ncommits unfair labor practices \"likely to destroy the union's majority\n\n                                -11-\n\fand seriously impede the election\"). Second, an election was held\n\nand the Union won, and so that is another basis for the\n\nobligation to bargain. See NLRB v. Horizon Air Servs., Inc., 761\n\nF.2d 22, 28 (1st Cir. 1985).       North Atlantic seeks to undermine\n\nboth of these grounds for the bargaining orders with the same\n\nargument:      the    pro-union    activities      of   the   supervisor\n\nconstituted a threat, albeit indirect, to employees that if they\n\ndid not vote for the union there would be consequences, and so\n\nit cannot be said there was a fair and free choice made.\n\nBecause the parties have done so, we treat the analysis of the\n\ntwo grounds as the same; any variations are not material for\n\nresolution of the issue.5\n\n            Normally in representation cases, our review of the\n\nNLRB determinations is for abuse of discretion. Fall River Sav.\n\nBank v. NLRB, 649 F.2d 50, 56 (1st Cir. 1981).            The Board has\n\n\"broad discretion to determine whether the circumstances of an\n\nelection have allowed the employees to exercise free choice in\n\ndeciding    whether   to   be   represented   by   a    union,\"   Comcast\n\n\n\n    5     For example, there is no claim here that the supervisor\nsolicited union authorization cards. Cf. NLRB v. WKRG-TV, Inc.,\n470 F.2d 1302, 1313-15 (5th Cir. 1973).\n\n                                  -12-\n\fCablevision-Taylor v. NLRB, 232 F.3d 490, 494 (6th Cir. 2000)\n\n(citations omitted), and we take the Board's findings of fact to\n\nbe \"conclusive if supported by substantial evidence on the\n\nrecord considered as a whole,\" Visiting Nurse Servs. of Western\n\nMass., Inc. v. NLRB, 177 F.3d 52, 56 (1st Cir. 1999) (citations\n\nomitted),    cert.   denied,   528   U.S.   1074   (2000).   However,\n\ndiscretion is abused if an incorrect legal standard is used.\n\nSee Soto v. Flores, 103 F.3d 1056, 1063 (1st Cir.) (district\n\ncourt abuses discretion when it makes error of law), cert.\n\ndenied, 522 U.S. 819 (1997).            North Atlantic fashions its\n\nargument in this raiment, urging us to adopt the standards used\n\nby the Ninth Circuit in NLRB v. Island Film Processing Co., 784 F.2d\n\n1446 (9th Cir. 1986), standards which it views as making it easier\n\nto show that the supervisor’s activities amounted to implicit\n\ncoercion, even when not overt.       The Board resists and says the\n\nIsland Films view is an outlier, and is inconsistent with First\n\nCircuit precedent. Our review of the Board's conclusions of law\n\nis de novo.    Visiting Nurse Servs., 177 F.3d at 56.\n\n            Both an organizing campaign and an election involve the\n\nbalancing of First Amendment freedoms of expression against the\n\nneed to prevent coercion of employees, and the balance is meant\n\n                                 -13-\n\fto preserve the employees’ ability to make a free choice.           The\n\nFirst Amendment protections concerned Congress when it enacted\n\nthe National Labor Relations Act, and so it provided in 29\n\nU.S.C. § 158(c):\n\n          The expressing of any views, argument, or\n          opinion, or the dissemination thereof,\n          whether in written, printed, graphic, or\n          visual form, shall not constitute or be\n          evidence of an unfair labor practice under\n          any of the provisions of this subchapter, if\n          such expression contains no threat of\n          reprisal or force or promise of benefit.\n\n          The Board tells us it has attempted to be even-handed\n\nin its application of the rules imposing consequences for\n\ncertain speech, recognizing that neither the employer nor the\n\nunion side may alter the balance in an election by threats of\n\nreprisal or promises of benefits.         And the Supreme Court tells\n\nus that Congress intended the Board to have a wide degree of\n\ndiscretion   \"in    establishing    the   procedure   and    safeguards\n\nnecessary to insure the fair and free choice of bargaining\n\nrepresentatives by employees.\"        NLRB v. A.J. Tower Co., 329 US\n\n324, 330 (1946).     The Board's discretion is not unlimited and\n\nthe Supreme Court has reversed it where it has violated the\n\nbasic   principle   that   \"[a]ny    procedure   requiring    a   'fair'\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\felection must honor the right of those who oppose a union as\n\nwell as those who favor it.    The Act is wholly neutral when it\n\ncomes to that basic choice.\"   NLRB v. Savair Mfg. Co., 414 U.S.\n\n270, 278 (1973).\n\n          Under the Board's rules, a party may bring a challenge\n\nto election results before the Board \"only where compelling\n\nreasons exist therefor,\" including grounds that a \"substantial\n\nquestion of law or policy is raised\" not governed by Board\n\nprecedent or that there was a prejudicial error.    See 29 C.F.R.\n\n§ 102.67(c).   But a party cannot seek direct court review of the\n\nBoard's   certification   decisions;   it   can   only     challenge\n\ncertification in the context of a refusal to bargain unfair\n\nlabor practice charge.    See NLRB v. S. Prawer & Co., 584 F.2d\n\n1099, 1101 (1st Cir. 1978).      The side claiming taint of an\n\nelection, or any unfairness that warrants the election being set\n\naside, bears the burden of proof on the issue.           See Comcast\n\nCablevision, 232 F.3d at 494 (party seeking to overturn election\n\n\"bears the burden of showing that the election was not conducted\n\nfairly\") (internal quotation marks omitted); cf. NLRB v. Dobbs\n\nHouse, Inc., 613 F.2d 1254, 1256 (5th Cir. 1980) (courts have\n\nadded as an \"additional requirement\" that burden is on party\n\n                               -15-\n\fseeking Board review of election to \"present specific evidence\n\nwhich prima facie would warrant setting aside the election\")\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).              Bearing in mind that a\n\nparty seeking to set aside an election bears a \"heavy burden\" of\n\ndemonstrating that the Board abused its discretion, Melrose-\n\nWakefield Hosp. Ass’n v. NLRB, 615 F.2d 563, 566 (1st Cir.\n\n1980), we review the Board's decision that the supervisor's\n\ninvolvement did not interfere with employee free choice here.\n\n            The role of a supervisor attempting to help the union\n\norganize his workplace might be thought a bit odd, and here, as\n\nis often true, there was a dispute about whether the supervisor\n\nwas really a supervisor or was an employee.               See, e.g., Wright\n\nMemorial Hosp. v. NLRB, 771 F.2d 400 (8th Cir. 1985); NLRB v.\n\nNortheastern Univ., 707 F.2d 15 (1st Cir. 1983).                   Here, the\n\nBoard ruled that the individual was a supervisor.               A pro-union\n\nsupervisor      presents       two    possible   scenarios    which    could\n\ninterfere    with   a   fair    and    free   election.      The   first   is\n\nconfusion; the second is coercion.            There may be confusion felt\n\nby employees about the message from management if one of\n\nmanagement’s own, a supervisor, urges the union upon employees.\n\nOr there may be a second effect,                 that a supervisor may\n\n                                      -16-\n\fexplicitly or implicitly coerce employees into voting for the\n\nunion.    See Fall River Sav. Bank, 649 F.2d at 56 (employees might\n\nsupport union \"out of fear of retaliation\" by pro-union supervisor).\n\n           This case does not raise the first concern.                  The\n\nemployer left no one in doubt of its anti-union position, as the\n\nuncontested   findings   of     unfair    labor   practices   against   it\n\nattest.   Indeed, supervisor Custer, in his debut on this issue,\n\nwarned    other   employees    that   North   Atlantic   president      was\n\nvirulently anti-union.        Accord Catholic Med. Ctr. v. NLRB, 620\n\nF.2d 20, 22 (2d Cir. 1980) (supervisor's support of union posed\n\nno risk of confusion about employer's position in view of its\n\n\"vigorous campaign against the Union\").\n\n           And so we turn to the second concern: whether there has\n\nbeen explicit or implicit coercion.         While this Circuit has not\n\nhad an abundance of these cases, the few existing decisions\n\nestablish the principle that \"without evidence of any threats,\n\nexpress or implied, [the fact that supervisors favor a union ]\n\ndoes not compel a finding of coercion.\"           Fall River Sav. Bank,\n\n649 F.2d at 57, quoted in Northeastern Univ., 707 F.2d at 18.\n\nBoth sides make rather too much of this statement, since it\n\npertains only to whether such evidence alone would compel a\n\n                                   -17-\n\ffinding of coercion, contrary to the Board’s conclusion that\n\nthere was no coercion.    It is, for example, equally true that\n\nthe fact that the employer opposes a union does not compel a\n\nfinding of coercion.     That is different from the question of\n\nwhether the Board could find implicit coercion from the fact\n\nthat a strong supervisor was pro-union.          It is also very\n\ndifferent from the question that concerns us:            whether the\n\nBoard’s finding is supportable that a pro-union supervisor, by\n\nhis conduct and his speech, did not invalidate free choice. But\n\nthere is an important point:     when the factual predicates for\n\nthe Board’s decisions are attacked, they may not be set aside\n\nunless the record compels a different conclusion, and so it can\n\nbe said that the decision is not supported by \"substantial\n\nevidence.\"   NLRB v. Hosp. San Pablo, Inc., 207 F.3d 67, 70 (1st\n\nCir. 2000) (court must accept Board's factual findings \"unless\n\nthose findings are not supported by substantial evidence on the\n\nrecord considered as a whole\") (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitations    omitted).   We   evaluate   the   Board’s   finding   by\n\nexamination of certain factors set forth in Board and court\n\ncases involving claims of coercion or reward by pro-union\n\nsupervisors.\n\n                               -18-\n\f           The initial focus is on whether there were coercive\n\nactions by the supervisor against anti-union employees, actions\n\nsuch as discharge, surveillance, coercive investigation, or\n\nrewards.     Similarly, courts focus on whether there were words\n\nthat amounted to an express threat or promise of reward.                       See\n\nGissel, 395 U.S. at 615. This case involves none of these.                     Cf.\n\nComcast    Cablevision,      232    F.3d    at   495   (reversing       NLRB   and\n\ninvalidating election where union offered employees free weekend\n\ntrip at the union's expense).\n\n           Instead, this case involves the more subtle question\n\nof whether the conduct and speech of the supervisor amounted to\n\nimplicit     threats    or    coercion.          The   Board    has    generally\n\nconsidered the specific facts and circumstances and looked to\n\nthree   areas   of     inquiry:       the    nature     of     the    supervisory\n\nauthority,    the    nature    of   the     activity    and     speech    of   the\n\nsupervisor, and the context in which the supervisor acted.\n\n             The first line of inquiry looks to the scope of the\n\nsupervisor's role over the employees to determine whether the\n\nsupervisor has the actual ability to harm the interests of the\n\nemployees or to reward them.         See Fall River Sav. Bank, 649 F.2d\n\nat 57 (Board relied on limited power of branch managers to\n\n                                     -19-\n\fretaliate      against   tellers    in     finding    no   coercion);      cf.\n\nHarborside Healthcare, Inc. v. NLRB, 230 F.3d 206, 210-11 (6th\n\nCir.   2000)    (analyzing   nature      of   supervisory      authority   to\n\ndetermine      whether   effect    of    charge      nurse's   conduct     was\n\ncoercive). There is nothing unreasonable about such an inquiry;\n\nindeed, an immediate low-level supervisor may have much more\n\nactual power to coerce or to reward than someone with a higher\n\ntitle in the corporate totem pole.                This line of inquiry\n\ngenerally involves questions about the role of the supervisor in\n\nhiring, firing, wages, promotions, and other job benefits.\n\nHere, the Administrative Law Judge made exactly this inquiry,\n\nalbeit on the question of whether Custer was a supervisor at\n\nall, and concluded that Custer \"had the authority to effectively\n\nrecommend personnel actions with respect to raises, hiring,\n\ndiscipline and overtime and he responsibly directed employees in\n\nat least some respects.\"\n\n            The period of time that this supervisory authority\n\nexisted is also relevant.            The ALJ noted that Custer was\n\nterminated by North Atlantic early in the organizing campaign.\n\nAlthough Custer continued to attend union meetings, he no longer\n\nhad workplace authority.          The ALJ acknowledged that this fact\n\n                                    -20-\n\falone was not dispositive in the Union’s favor, given the\n\nprecedent of NLRB v. Howard Johnson Motor Lodge, 705 F.2d 932\n\n(7th Cir. 1983).   There, a hearing was held on claims of taint\n\nresulting from the pro-union activity by a supervisor who was\n\nfired.    Unlike   here,   there   was   a   reasonable   chance   the\n\nsupervisor would be returned to her position as a supervisor,\n\nthus raising the possibility of coercion.       Here, there was, to\n\nquote the ALJ, \"no realistic possibility\" of such coercion\n\nbecause the Union's claim that Custer had been wrongly fired\n\ndepended on Custer being characterized as an employee and not as\n\na supervisor.   If Custer had been returned to work as a result\n\nof the Union’s filing of an unfair labor practice charge, his\n\nposition would have been as an employee, not a supervisor.6\n\n         The second area of inquiry has to do with a very fact-\n\nintensive examination of the activities and speech of the\n\nsupervisor.   The ALJ found that Custer's pro-union activity was\n\nvery limited: he attended union meetings, but when he spoke, it\n\n\n    6     It is theoretically possible, of course, that other\nemployees might nonetheless perceive him, despite his being\ncharacterized by the ALJ as an employee, to have some sort of\nsupervisory power over them. This case, as the facts described\nlater show, does not raise any such issue of perceived\nauthority.\n\n                               -21-\n\fwas mostly to say that the employees would have a tough time\n\ngetting a union given the attitude of North Atlantic president.\n\nCuster's most explicit statements of union support came, not\n\nsurprisingly, after he had been fired.      He had no supervisory\n\nauthority then.      The ALJ also noted the lack of certain\n\nevidence.     There was no evidence, for example, that Custer\n\npassed out or collected authorization cards, campaigned for the\n\nUnion while he was a supervisor, or made promises or engaged in\n\nany form of coercion to further his pro-union views.      And there\n\nwas no evidence from which it could be reasonably inferred that\n\nother employees felt Custer was trying to force them to support\n\nthe Union.\n\n            On this last point, there is an evidentiary refinement.\n\nThe Supreme Court in Gissel cautioned against after-the-fact\n\nevidence from employees as to whether they had felt coerced in\n\nany way, noting that even that testimony could be subject to\n\ncoercion. See 395 U.S. at 608 (employee's testimony about subjective\n\nperception of coercion may be unreliable due to employee's desire to\n\ncurry favor with employer).    We understand the ALJ to have kept\n\nthis principle in mind and to be referring to other evidence\n\nfrom which such coercion could be inferred.        But despite the\n\n                                -22-\n\fcaution in Gissel, it is also clear that on the question of\n\nwhether someone is a supervisor, the perceptions of other\n\nemployees may be taken into account.             See Fall River Sav. Bank,\n\n649   F.2d    at   57    n.7   (relying    on    employees'    testimony      in\n\ndetermining lack of threat); cf. Int'l Assoc. of Machinists v.\n\nNLRB, 311 U.S. 72, 79-80 (1940) (acts of perceived supervisors\n\nare to be accorded same weight as acts of actual supervisors if\n\nacting as agents of employer in election cases).               Since many of\n\nthese cases involve both questions -- supervisory coercion and\n\nsupervisory status -- there is no bright line evidentiary rule\n\npermitting or excluding such evidence per se.                   Cf. NLRB v.\n\nChicago Metallic Corp., 794 F.2d 527, 531 (9th Cir. 1986)\n\n(appropriate in \"borderline cases\" to consider whether person is\n\nperceived as a supervisor).\n\n             Finally, there is an examination of context.                 As the\n\nALJ found, North Atlantic had itself engaged in coercion and\n\ndiscrimination in an effort to stop the Union. In this context,\n\n\"the employees could not possibly believe . . . that they had\n\nanything to fear by offending Custer and opposing the Union.\"\n\nAgain,   there     was    no   suggestion       that   this   fact   of    North\n\nAtlantic’s strong anti-unionism was dispositive. It may well be\n\n                                    -23-\n\fthat a supervisor could engage in pro-union coercion even while\n\nthe company is virulently anti-union.             See WKRG-TV, 470 F.2d at\n\n1315, n.8 (\"[R]easonable fear of supervisory retaliation can be\n\npresent even if the company hierarchy has openly opposed the\n\nunion.\").\n\n            Viewing all the facts,         the Board concluded there was\n\nno conduct or speech by supervisor Custer that would give rise\n\nto   an    inference    of    coercion,    and    therefore    no   basis   to\n\ninvalidate either the authorization cards or the election.                  The\n\nBoard's determination of whether a supervisor's conduct tainted\n\nan election is \"essentially a matter of drawing inferences, and\n\nit has long been settled that an agency's conclusions based upon\n\nsuch inferences should not be set aside by a reviewing court\n\nunless they transgress the bounds of reason.\"                 Catholic Med.\n\nCtr.,     620   F.2d   at    22.   Here,    the    Board's    conclusion    is\n\nreasonable and very far from an abuse of discretion.\n\n            North Atlantic attacks this conclusion by saying that\n\nit has been held to too high a standard of proof.               All it needs\n\nto show, it says, relying on the Ninth Circuit decision in\n\nIsland Film, is that the pro-union supervisory activity would\n\n\"reasonably tend\" to have a coercive effect, and does not need\n\n                                    -24-\n\fto show actual proof of coercion.    It also says that in most of\n\nthese sorts of cases, where management loses, management is\n\naware of what its wayward supervisors are doing and does nothing\n\nin response. See NLRB v. Lamar Electric Membership Corp., 362 F.2d\n\n505, 506-07 (5th Cir. 1966) (\"[W]here the employer knows of the\n\nadvocacy and takes no steps to dissipate its effect, such\n\nadvocacy may not be used as\n\na basis for setting aside the election.\"); see also Fall River\n\nSav. Bank, 649 F.2d at 56 n.5 (employer who fails to exercise\n\nauthority over known pro-union activities by supervisor \"may not\n\nlater be heard to complain of the results of its inaction\").\n\nNorth Atlantic should not be put in that category, it says,\n\nbecause it did not know what Custer was doing until the day of\n\nthe election.    More than that, it says, North Atlantic should\n\nprevail because it had no opportunity to respond to what Custer\n\nwas doing.      The harm Custer did, North Atlantic argues, is\n\nmagnified because the bargaining unit was very small and only a\n\nfew votes would make a difference in the outcome.\n\n            There are three difficulties with North Atlantic’s\n\nargument.     First, it makes no allowance for the fact that\n\njudicial review is deferential to the Board, unless the Board's\n\n                              -25-\n\fdecision is \"arbitrary and capricious\" or its findings not\n\nsupported   by   substantial    evidence.       NLRB   v.   Beverly\n\nEnterprises-Massachusetts, Inc., 174 F.3d 13, 34 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).   There is no serious claim that the Board's position\n\nviolates the Act, cf. NLRB v. Health Care & Retirement Corp.,\n\n511 U.S. 571, 574-584 (1994), or that it is an unreasonable\n\ninterpretation of an ambiguous statute, see NLRB v. Hilliard\n\nDevelopment Corp., 187 F.3d 133, 140-41 (1st Cir. 1999).        The\n\ndecision is neither arbitrary and capricious nor unsupported.\n\nSecondly, the facts as found by the ALJ simply do not raise the\n\nquestions posed by North Atlantic.         The ALJ found that the\n\nactivities of the supervisor were so minimal that no \"reasonable\n\npossibility\" of taint emerged.         That was so whether or not\n\nmanagement knew of Custer’s activities.     Thirdly, we think that\n\nNorth Atlantic may overread Island Films.    We do not, initially,\n\nread it as saying that no proof of coercion, either express or\n\nimplied, need be offered.7     Although Island Films purported to\n\n\n    7     If, on the other hand, we misunderstand Island Film and\nit does hold that mere supervisory status alone compels a\nfinding of coercion, or to use the language of that opinion,\nthat such status alone is sufficient to show that the activity\nreasonably tends to have a coercive effect, then the Board is\ncorrect that such a rule is in conflict with First Circuit law,\n\n                                -26-\n\festablish a standard that \"[s]upervisory activity need only\n\n'reasonably tend' to have a coercive effect on or 'likely to\n\nimpair' [sic] an employee’s choice,\" 784 F.2d at 1451, we do not\n\ntake that language as intended to establish a new standard of\n\njudicial review, as North Atlantic here suggests, apart from the\n\nusual abuse of discretion and substantial evidence standard,\n\nwhich we apply.   The Ninth Circuit itself has disavowed these\n\ntwo readings of Island Film.     See Napili Shores Condominium\n\nHomeowners' Ass'n v. NLRB, 939 F.2d 717, 718-19 (9th Cir. 1991)\n\n(applying usual deferential standard and holding that pro-union\n\nsupervisory participation does not per se invalidate election).\n\n         For these reasons, we grant the Board's petition for\n\nenforcement of its orders and dismiss North Atlantic’s petition\n\nfor review.\n\n\n\n\nby which we are bound.\n\n                              -27-\n\f",

North Atlantic fought fiercely and also unfairly and now has unfair labor practice findings against it, as well as a bargaining order. A supervisor, though, had pro-union sympathies which he openly expressed. The employees -- that is, a majority of them -- both signed union representation cards and voted for unionization in an election. The employer has refused to bargain with the Union and twice has been ordered by the National Labor Relations Board to do so. The Board now petitions for enforcement of its various orders. North Atlantic also petitions for review, saying that both the election and the authorization cards, and thus the consequent Board orders to bargain, must be set aside because the supervisor's conduct biased the outcome. North Atlantic has not challenged the finding of unfair labor practices on its part. The case involves review of the Board's determination that the pro-union activities of a supervisor were not sufficient to deprive employees of their right to a free and uncoerced choice, and thus to set aside the two bases for the bargaining order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We summarize the Administrative Law Judge's undisputed findings of fact, adopted by the Board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">North Atlantic Medical Services supplies medical equipment. That equipment is delivered by field service technicians, or drivers. In April 1995, when union organizing efforts began, North Atlantic employed approximately eleven drivers and mechanics at its Leominster facility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the request of driver Marco Nagle, union organizer Al Stearns met on April 6, 1995, with Nagle and four other North Atlantic employees who were interested in unionization.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Field Service Manager Steven Custer also attended the meeting. Custer said he supported unionization but told the others that North Atlantic's president, Carbot Carabott, was adamantly opposed to unionization and had once threatened to \"lock the [ ] doors\" if the employees tried to organize a union. Custer warned that Carabott would \"do everything in his power to make it miserable for everyone\" if they tried to organize. All six attendees, including Custer, signed union authorization cards at that meeting. Custer did not himself pass out cards or ask employees to sign the cards, nor did he promise rewards if they supported unionization or punishment if they did not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after the meeting, Nagle obtained signed cards from three more employees. When Stearns again met with employees on April 13, eight of the eleven unit members had signed cards. Stearns filed a representation petition with the Board. The Board then sent a copy to North Atlantic on April 17. The parties agreed to an election set for June 1, 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the weeks before the election, North Atlantic launched a campaign to defeat unionization. It undertook a series of personnel actions designed to undermine support for unionization in the bargaining unit. Three days after receiving the petition, on April 20, North Atlantic removed Gary Roy, a union supporter who had signed an authorization card on April 6, from a light duty assignment and placed him on full worker's compensation pending further investigation of his condition. North Atlantic fired Roy a month later on May 22. Also on May 22, North Atlantic laid off another driver in the unit, Marc Kiroac, for \"lack of work,\" although Kiroac had worked over 60 hours in each of the previous two weeks, and was recalled one week after the election. And on April 21, North Atlantic transferred a salesman, Michael McDermott, a union opponent, back into the bargaining unit as a driver in order to dilute support for unionization. McDermott did not want to transfer and told other drivers that he was eager for the election to be over so he could go back to his sales job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">President Carabott held two mandatory employee meetings to discuss his opposition to unionization. At the meetings, Carabott questioned employees directly about their reasons for supporting unionization, and told them they could work down the street if they wanted a union. He also said that he would get out of the business when it stopped being \"fun,\" and spoke about a friend's company that went out of business after employees chose unionization. This was an implied threat that North Atlantic would go out of business if the drivers won representation rights. Calling the unionization effort a \"battle in a war,\" Carabott said that he would not lose this war. He warned that unionization would be futile because there would be no extra benefits even if the employees chose union representation, and that although a union could offer anything, he had the final say as to what would be given. Carabott also announced a new \"open door policy\" and solicited grievances from employees, and implied that he would suspend that policy if employees unionized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">North Atlantic also distributed two anti-union memoranda to employees shortly before the June 1 election. In the second memo, which accompanied paychecks, Carabott wrote that unionization could \"endanger the financial stability of this company and also the livelihood that enables you to provide for your family\" because customers would be unlikely to continue to do business with a unionized company due to the threat of strikes. Carabott also warned that a strike \"means loss of business and loss of jobs.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, on April 20, three days after it received the representation petition, North Atlantic fired Field Service Manager Custer, purportedly for failing to competently perform his responsibilities as service manager. The Union filed a discriminatory discharge charge on Custer's behalf on May 22.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The Union argued that Custer was an employee, fired in retaliation for his support of unionization. Custer attended four more union meetings before the June 1 election, but did not pressure employees to support unionization. He asked some employees in general terms whether they planned to vote for the Union, and told them that they should only do so if they were \"110 percent sure\" because President Carabott would fiercely resist unionization. Custer also voted in the June 1 election.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the election, the Board held a hearing to resolve challenges to several of the ballots. The Board rejected North Atlantic's challenge to the Union's majority status based on Custer's pro-union activities. Further, the Board found that North Atlantic committed numerous unfair labor practices, including firing several employees in retaliation for their union support, making unilateral changes to evaluation and compensation policies, threatening employees with job loss, and telling employees that unionization was futile because having a union would not result in improved benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of North Atlantic's unfair labor practices, the Board concluded that a remedial bargaining order was warranted, requiring North Atlantic to recognize and bargain with the Union.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board ordered North Atlantic to cease and desist from the unfair labor practices and from interfering with or coercing employees in the exercise of their rights under the Act. North Atlantic was also required to offer reinstatement to the fired employees and to compensate all employees for losses caused by its unfair labor practices. Finally, the Board ruled that the remaining valid ballots were to be counted and, if the Union received a majority of the valid ballots, directed the Regional Director to certify the Union as the employees' exclusive bargaining representative.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The Board ordered the Regional Director to set aside the election if the Union did not receive a majority of the ballots cast.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Union was certified after a revised tally revealed that the Union indeed had won the election, by a count of eight to two. But North Atlantic again refused the Union's request for recognition and bargaining, claiming that the Union had been improperly certified because Custer's pro-union activities tainted the election, requiring it to be set aside. Acting on a Union complaint, the Board's General Counsel issued an unfair labor practice complaint and the Board granted its motion for summary judgment against North Atlantic. The Board found that North Atlantic had not produced any new evidence or special circumstances requiring the Board to alter its earlier decision that Custer's activities did not taint the representation proceedings. The Board concluded that North Atlantic's refusal to bargain with the Union violated the Act and again ordered North Atlantic to bargain with the Union and to cease and desist from interfering with, restraining, or coercing employees in the exercise of their rights under the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its petition for enforcement, the Board seeks summary affirmance of its findings that North Atlantic committed several unfair labor practices, which North Atlantic does not challenge on appeal. Further, the Board seeks affirmance of its finding that the Union achieved a valid card majority which, combined with the numerous unfair labor practices, led the Board to certify the Union as the exclusive bargaining representative; that certification formed the basis of the Board's remedial bargaining order and refusal to bargain unfair labor practices finding in 1995. The Board also requests affirmance of its finding that North Atlantic violated the Act by refusing to bargain with the Union after it won the election and was again certified as the exclusive bargaining agent in 1999. North Atlantic seeks review of the Board's orders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ultimate issue here is whether North Atlantic has an obligation to bargain with the Union, as ordered by the Board. There are two bases for the Board's bargaining orders. First, there is a Gissel bargaining order, which provides a basis for a bargaining order irrespective of the outcome of the election because the Board found North Atlantic had committed massive unfair labor practices, sufficient to render a fair election improbable, and the Union had obtained an authorization card majority. See NLRB v. Gissel Packaging Co., 395 U.S. 575, 600, 610, 613 (1969) (Board can impose bargaining obligation on employer which refuses to recognize union that has obtained card majority and commits unfair labor practices \"likely to destroy the union's majority and seriously impede the election\"). Second, an election was held and the Union won, and so that is another basis for the obligation to bargain. See NLRB v. Horizon Air Servs., Inc., 761 F.2d 22, 28 (1st Cir. 1985). North Atlantic seeks to undermine both of these grounds for the bargaining orders with the same argument: the pro-union activities of the supervisor constituted a threat, albeit indirect, to employees that if they did not vote for the union there would be consequences, and so it cannot be said there was a fair and free choice made. Because the parties have done so, we treat the analysis of the two grounds as the same; any variations are not material for resolution of the issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Normally in representation cases, our review of the NLRB determinations is for abuse of discretion. Fall River Sav. Bank v. NLRB, 649 F.2d 50, 56 (1st Cir. 1981). The Board has \"broad discretion to determine whether the circumstances of an election have allowed the employees to exercise free choice in deciding whether to be represented by a union,\" Comcast Cablevision-Taylor v. NLRB, 232 F.3d 490, 494 (6th Cir. 2000) (citations omitted), and we take the Board's findings of fact to be \"conclusive if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole,\" Visiting Nurse Servs. of Western Mass., Inc. v. NLRB, 177 F.3d 52, 56 (1st Cir. 1999) (citations omitted), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1074 (2000). However, discretion is abused if an incorrect legal standard is used. See Soto v. Flores, 103 F.3d 1056, 1063 (1st Cir.) (district court abuses discretion when it makes error of law), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 819 (1997). North Atlantic fashions its argument in this raiment, urging us to adopt the standards used by the Ninth Circuit in NLRB v. Island Film Processing Co., 784 F.2d 1446 (9th Cir. 1986), standards which it views as making it easier to show that the supervisor's activities amounted to implicit coercion, even when not overt. The Board resists and says the Island Films view is an outlier, and is inconsistent with First Circuit precedent. Our review of the Board's conclusions of law is de novo. Visiting Nurse Servs., 177 F.3d at 56.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both an organizing campaign and an election involve the balancing of First Amendment freedoms of expression against the need to prevent coercion of employees, and the balance is meant to preserve the employees' ability to make a free choice. The First Amendment protections concerned Congress when it enacted the National Labor Relations Act, and so it provided in 29 U.S.C. &#167; 158(c):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The expressing of any views, argument, or opinion, or the dissemination thereof, whether in written, printed, graphic, or visual form, shall not constitute or be evidence of an unfair labor practice under any of the provisions of this subchapter, if such expression contains no threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board tells us it has attempted to be even-handed in its application of the rules imposing consequences for certain speech, recognizing that neither the employer nor the union side may alter the balance in an election by threats of reprisal or promises of benefits. And the Supreme Court tells us that Congress intended the Board to have a wide degree of discretion \"in establishing the procedure and safeguards necessary to insure the fair and free choice of bargaining representatives by employees.\" NLRB v. A.J. Tower Co., 329 US 324, 330 (1946). The Board's discretion is not unlimited and the Supreme Court has reversed it where it has violated the basic principle that \"[a]ny procedure requiring a 'fair' election must honor the right of those who oppose a union as well as those who favor it. The Act is wholly neutral when it comes to that basic choice.\" NLRB v. Savair Mfg. Co., 414 U.S. 270, 278 (1973).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Board's rules, a party may bring a challenge to election results before the Board \"only where compelling reasons exist therefor,\" including grounds that a \"substantial question of law or policy is raised\" not governed by Board precedent or that there was a prejudicial error. See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 102.67(c). But a party cannot seek direct court review of the Board's certification decisions; it can only challenge certification in the context of a refusal to bargain unfair labor practice charge. See NLRB v. S. Prawer &amp; Co., 584 F.2d 1099, 1101 (1st Cir. 1978). The side claiming taint of an election, or any unfairness that warrants the election being set aside, bears the burden of proof on the issue. See Comcast Cablevision, 232 F.3d at 494 (party seeking to overturn election \"bears the burden of showing that the election was not conducted fairly\") (internal quotation marks omitted); cf. NLRB v. Dobbs House, Inc., 613 F.2d 1254, 1256 (5th Cir. 1980) (courts have added as an \"additional requirement\" that burden is on party seeking Board review of election to \"present specific evidence which prima facie would warrant setting aside the election\") (internal quotation marks omitted). Bearing in mind that a party seeking to set aside an election bears a \"heavy burden\" of demonstrating that the Board abused its discretion, Melrose-Wakefield Hosp. Ass'n v. NLRB, 615 F.2d 563, 566 (1st Cir. 1980), we review the Board's decision that the supervisor's involvement did not interfere with employee free choice here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The role of a supervisor attempting to help the union organize his workplace might be thought a bit odd, and here, as is often true, there was a dispute about whether the supervisor was really a supervisor or was an employee. See, e.g., Wright Memorial Hosp. v. NLRB, 771 F.2d 400 (8th Cir. 1985); NLRB v. Northeastern Univ., 707 F.2d 15 (1st Cir. 1983). Here, the Board ruled that the individual was a supervisor. A pro-union supervisor presents two possible scenarios which could interfere with a fair and free election. The first is confusion; the second is coercion. There may be confusion felt by employees about the message from management if one of management's own, a supervisor, urges the union upon employees. Or there may be a second effect, that a supervisor may explicitly or implicitly coerce employees into voting for the union. See Fall River Sav. Bank, 649 F.2d at 56 (employees might support union \"out of fear of retaliation\" by pro-union supervisor).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case does not raise the first concern. The employer left no one in doubt of its anti-union position, as the uncontested findings of unfair labor practices against it attest. Indeed, supervisor Custer, in his debut on this issue, warned other employees that North Atlantic president was virulently anti-union. Accord Catholic Med. Ctr. v. NLRB, 620 F.2d 20, 22 (2d Cir. 1980) (supervisor's support of union posed no risk of confusion about employer's position in view of its \"vigorous campaign against the Union\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And so we turn to the second concern: whether there has been explicit or implicit coercion. While this Circuit has not had an abundance of these cases, the few existing decisions establish the principle that \"without evidence of any threats, express or implied, [the fact that supervisors favor a union ] does not compel a finding of coercion.\" Fall River Sav. Bank, 649 F.2d at 57, quoted in Northeastern Univ., 707 F.2d at 18. Both sides make rather too much of this statement, since it pertains only to whether such evidence alone would compel a finding of coercion, contrary to the Board's conclusion that there was no coercion. It is, for example, equally true that the fact that the employer opposes a union does not compel a finding of coercion. That is different from the question of whether the Board could find implicit coercion from the fact that a strong supervisor was pro-union. It is also very different from the question that concerns us: whether the Board's finding is supportable that a pro-union supervisor, by his conduct and his speech, did not invalidate free choice. But there is an important point: when the factual predicates for the Board's decisions are attacked, they may not be set aside unless the record compels a different conclusion, and so it can be said that the decision is not supported by \"substantial evidence.\" NLRB v. Hosp. San Pablo, Inc., 207 F.3d 67, 70 (1st Cir. 2000) (court must accept Board's factual findings \"unless those findings are not supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole\") (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). We evaluate the Board's finding by examination of certain factors set forth in Board and court cases involving claims of coercion or reward by pro-union supervisors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The initial focus is on whether there were coercive actions by the supervisor against anti-union employees, actions such as discharge, surveillance, coercive investigation, or rewards. Similarly, courts focus on whether there were words that amounted to an express threat or promise of reward. SeeGissel, 395 U.S. at 615. This case involves none of these. Cf.Comcast Cablevision, 232 F.3d at 495 (reversing NLRB and invalidating election where union offered employees free weekend trip at the union's expense).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, this case involves the more subtle question of whether the conduct and speech of the supervisor amounted to implicit threats or coercion. The Board has generally considered the specific facts and circumstances and looked to three areas of inquiry: the nature of the supervisory authority, the nature of the activity and speech of the supervisor, and the context in which the supervisor acted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first line of inquiry looks to the scope of the supervisor's role over the employees to determine whether the supervisor has the actual ability to harm the interests of the employees or to reward them. See Fall River Sav. Bank, 649 F.2d at 57 (Board relied on limited power of branch managers to retaliate against tellers in finding no coercion); cf.Harborside Healthcare, Inc. v. NLRB, 230 F.3d 206, 210-11 (6th Cir. 2000) (analyzing nature of supervisory authority to determine whether effect of charge nurse's conduct was coercive). There is nothing unreasonable about such an inquiry; indeed, an immediate low-level supervisor may have much more actual power to coerce or to reward than someone with a higher title in the corporate totem pole. This line of inquiry generally involves questions about the role of the supervisor in hiring, firing, wages, promotions, and other job benefits. Here, the Administrative Law Judge made exactly this inquiry, albeit on the question of whether Custer was a supervisor at all, and concluded that Custer \"had the authority to effectively recommend personnel actions with respect to raises, hiring, discipline and overtime and he responsibly directed employees in at least some respects.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The period of time that this supervisory authority existed is also relevant. The ALJ noted that Custer was terminated by North Atlantic early in the organizing campaign. Although Custer continued to attend union meetings, he no longer had workplace authority. The ALJ acknowledged that this fact alone was not dispositive in the Union's favor, given the precedent of NLRB v. Howard Johnson Motor Lodge, 705 F.2d 932 (7th Cir. 1983). There, a hearing was held on claims of taint resulting from the pro-union activity by a supervisor who was fired. Unlike here, there was a reasonable chance the supervisor would be returned to her position as a supervisor, thus raising the possibility of coercion. Here, there was, to quote the ALJ, \"no realistic possibility\" of such coercion because the Union's claim that Custer had been wrongly fired depended on Custer being characterized as an employee and not as a supervisor. If Custer had been returned to work as a result of the Union's filing of an unfair labor practice charge, his position would have been as an employee, not a supervisor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second area of inquiry has to do with a very fact-intensive examination of the activities and speech of the supervisor. The ALJ found that Custer's pro-union activity was very limited: he attended union meetings, but when he spoke, it was mostly to say that the employees would have a tough time getting a union given the attitude of North Atlantic president. Custer's most explicit statements of union support came, not surprisingly, after he had been fired. He had no supervisory authority then. The ALJ also noted the lack of certain evidence. There was no evidence, for example, that Custer passed out or collected authorization cards, campaigned for the Union while he was a supervisor, or made promises or engaged in any form of coercion to further his pro-union views. And there was no evidence from which it could be reasonably inferred that other employees felt Custer was trying to force them to support the Union.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this last point, there is an evidentiary refinement. The Supreme Court in Gissel cautioned against after-the-fact evidence from employees as to whether they had felt coerced in any way, noting that even that testimony could be subject to coercion. See 395 U.S. at 608 (employee's testimony about subjective perception of coercion may be unreliable due to employee's desire to curry favor with employer). We understand the ALJ to have kept this principle in mind and to be referring to other evidence from which such coercion could be inferred. But despite the caution in Gissel, it is also clear that on the question of whether someone is a supervisor, the perceptions of other employees may be taken into account. See Fall River Sav. Bank, 649 F.2d at 57 n.7 (relying on employees' testimony in determining lack of threat); cf. Int'l Assoc. of Machinists v. NLRB, 311 U.S. 72, 79-80 (1940) (acts of perceived supervisors are to be accorded same weight as acts of actual supervisors if acting as agents of employer in election cases). Since many of these cases involve both questions -- supervisory coercion and supervisory status -- there is no bright line evidentiary rule permitting or excluding such evidence per se. Cf. NLRB v. Chicago Metallic Corp., 794 F.2d 527, 531 (9th Cir. 1986) (appropriate in \"borderline cases\" to consider whether person is perceived as a supervisor).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, there is an examination of context. As the ALJ found, North Atlantic had itself engaged in coercion and discrimination in an effort to stop the Union. In this context, \"the employees could not possibly believe . . . that they had anything to fear by offending Custer and opposing the Union.\" Again, there was no suggestion that this fact of North Atlantic's strong anti-unionism was dispositive. It may well be that a supervisor could engage in pro-union coercion even while the company is virulently anti-union. See WKRG-TV, 470 F.2d at 1315, n.8 (\"[R]easonable fear of supervisory retaliation can be present even if the company hierarchy has openly opposed the union.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewing all the facts, the Board concluded there was no conduct or speech by supervisor Custer that would give rise to an inference of coercion, and therefore no basis to invalidate either the authorization cards or the election. The Board's determination of whether a supervisor's conduct tainted an election is \"essentially a matter of drawing inferences, and it has long been settled that an agency's conclusions based upon such inferences should not be set aside by a reviewing court unless they transgress the bounds of reason.\" Catholic Med. Ctr., 620 F.2d at 22. Here, the Board's conclusion is reasonable and very far from an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">North Atlantic attacks this conclusion by saying that it has been held to too high a standard of proof. All it needs to show, it says, relying on the Ninth Circuit decision in Island Film, is that the pro-union supervisory activity would \"reasonably tend\" to have a coercive effect, and does not need to show actual proof of coercion. It also says that in most of these sorts of cases, where management loses, management is aware of what its wayward supervisors are doing and does nothing in response. See NLRB v. Lamar Electric Membership Corp., 362 F.2d 505, 506-07 (5th Cir. 1966) (\"[W]here the employer knows of the advocacy and takes no steps to dissipate its effect, such advocacy may not be used as a basis for setting aside the election.\"); see also Fall River Sav. Bank, 649 F.2d at 56 n.5 (employer who fails to exercise authority over known pro-union activities by supervisor \"may not later be heard to complain of the results of its inaction\"). North Atlantic should not be put in that category, it says, because it did not know what Custer was doing until the day of the election. More than that, it says, North Atlantic should prevail because it had no opportunity to respond to what Custer was doing. The harm Custer did, North Atlantic argues, is magnified because the bargaining unit was very small and only a few votes would make a difference in the outcome.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are three difficulties with North Atlantic's argument. First, it makes no allowance for the fact that judicial review is deferential to the Board, unless the Board's decision is \"arbitrary and capricious\" or its findings not supported by substantial evidence. NLRB v. Beverly Enterprises-Massachusetts, Inc., 174 F.3d 13, 34 (1st Cir. 1999). There is no serious claim that the Board's position violates the Act, cf. NLRB v. Health Care &amp; Retirement Corp., 511 U.S. 571, 574-584 (1994), or that it is an unreasonable interpretation of an ambiguous statute, see NLRB v. Hilliard Development Corp., 187 F.3d 133, 140-41 (1st Cir. 1999). The decision is neither arbitrary and capricious nor unsupported. Secondly, the facts as found by the ALJ simply do not raise the questions posed by North Atlantic. The ALJ found that the activities of the supervisor were so minimal that no \"reasonable possibility\" of taint emerged. That was so whether or not management knew of Custer's activities. Thirdly, we think that North Atlantic may overread Island Films. We do not, initially, read it as saying that no proof of coercion, either express or implied, need be offered.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Although Island Films purported to establish a standard that \"[s]upervisory activity need only 'reasonably tend' to have a coercive effect on or 'likely to impair' [sic] an employee's choice,\" 784 F.2d at 1451, we do not take that language as intended to establish a new standard of judicial review, as North Atlantic here suggests, apart from the usual abuse of discretion and substantial evidence standard, which we apply. The Ninth Circuit itself has disavowed these two readings of Island Film. See Napili Shores Condominium Homeowners' Ass'n v. NLRB, 939 F.2d 717, 718-19 (9th Cir. 1991) (applying usual deferential standard and holding that pro-union supervisory participation does not per se invalidate election).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we grant the Board's petition for enforcement of its orders and dismiss North Atlantic's petition for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Stearns represented the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, AFL-CIO.

North Atlantic fought fiercely and also unfairly and now has unfair labor practice findings against it, as well as a bargaining order. A supervisor, though, had pro-union sympathies which he openly expressed. The employees -- that is, a majority of them -- both signed union representation cards and voted for unionization in an election. The employer has refused to bargain with the Union and twice has been ordered by the National Labor Relations Board to do so. The Board now petitions for enforcement of its various orders. North Atlantic also petitions for review, saying that both the election and the authorization cards, and thus the consequent Board orders to bargain, must be set aside because the supervisor's conduct biased the outcome. North Atlantic has not challenged the finding of unfair labor practices on its part. The case involves review of the Board's determination that the pro-union activities of a supervisor were not sufficient to deprive employees of their right to a free and uncoerced choice, and thus to set aside the two bases for the bargaining order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We summarize the Administrative Law Judge's undisputed findings of fact, adopted by the Board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">North Atlantic Medical Services supplies medical equipment.

Custer said he supported unionization but told the others that North Atlantic's president, Carbot Carabott, was adamantly opposed to unionization and had once threatened to \"lock the [ ] doors\" if the employees tried to organize a union. Custer warned that Carabott would \"do everything in his power to make it miserable for everyone\" if they tried to organize. All six attendees, including Custer, signed union authorization cards at that meeting.

The parties agreed to an election set for June 1, 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the weeks before the election, North Atlantic launched a campaign to defeat unionization. It undertook a series of personnel actions designed to undermine support for unionization in the bargaining unit. Three days after receiving the petition, on April 20, North Atlantic removed Gary Roy, a union supporter who had signed an authorization card on April 6, from a light duty assignment and placed him on full worker's compensation pending further investigation of his condition. North Atlantic fired Roy a month later on May 22. Also on May 22, North Atlantic laid off another driver in the unit, Marc Kiroac, for \"lack of work,\" although Kiroac had worked over 60 hours in each of the previous two weeks, and was recalled one week after the election. And on April 21, North Atlantic transferred a salesman, Michael McDermott, a union opponent, back into the bargaining unit as a driver in order to dilute support for unionization. McDermott did not want to transfer and told other drivers that he was eager for the election to be over so he could go back to his sales job.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">President Carabott held two mandatory employee meetings to discuss his opposition to unionization. At the meetings, Carabott questioned employees directly about their reasons for supporting unionization, and told them they could work down the street if they wanted a union. He also said that he would get out of the business when it stopped being \"fun,\" and spoke about a friend's company that went out of business after employees chose unionization. This was an implied threat that North Atlantic would go out of business if the drivers won representation rights. Calling the unionization effort a \"battle in a war,\" Carabott said that he would not lose this war. He warned that unionization would be futile because there would be no extra benefits even if the employees chose union representation, and that although a union could offer anything, he had the final say as to what would be given. Carabott also announced a new \"open door policy\" and solicited grievances from employees, and implied that he would suspend that policy if employees unionized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">North Atlantic also distributed two anti-union memoranda to employees shortly before the June 1 election. In the second memo, which accompanied paychecks, Carabott wrote that unionization could \"endanger the financial stability of this company and also the livelihood that enables you to provide for your family\" because customers would be unlikely to continue to do business with a unionized company due to the threat of strikes. Carabott also warned that a strike \"means loss of business and loss of jobs.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, on April 20, three days after it received the representation petition, North Atlantic fired Field Service Manager Custer, purportedly for failing to competently perform his responsibilities as service manager. The Union filed a discriminatory discharge charge on Custer's behalf on May 22.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The Union argued that Custer was an employee, fired in retaliation for his support of unionization. Custer attended four more union meetings before the June 1 election, but did not pressure employees to support unionization. He asked some employees in general terms whether they planned to vote for the Union, and told them that they should only do so if they were \"110 percent sure\" because President Carabott would fiercely resist unionization. Custer also voted in the June 1 election.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the election, the Board held a hearing to resolve challenges to several of the ballots. The Board rejected North Atlantic's challenge to the Union's majority status based on Custer's pro-union activities. Further, the Board found that North Atlantic committed numerous unfair labor practices, including firing several employees in retaliation for their union support, making unilateral changes to evaluation and compensation policies, threatening employees with job loss, and telling employees that unionization was futile because having a union would not result in improved benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of North Atlantic's unfair labor practices, the Board concluded that a remedial bargaining order was warranted, requiring North Atlantic to recognize and bargain with the Union.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board ordered North Atlantic to cease and desist from the unfair labor practices and from interfering with or coercing employees in the exercise of their rights under the Act. North Atlantic was also required to offer reinstatement to the fired employees and to compensate all employees for losses caused by its unfair labor practices. Finally, the Board ruled that the remaining valid ballots were to be counted and, if the Union received a majority of the valid ballots, directed the Regional Director to certify the Union as the employees' exclusive bargaining representative.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The Board ordered the Regional Director to set aside the election if the Union did not receive a majority of the ballots cast.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Union was certified after a revised tally revealed that the Union indeed had won the election, by a count of eight to two. But North Atlantic again refused the Union's request for recognition and bargaining, claiming that the Union had been improperly certified because Custer's pro-union activities tainted the election, requiring it to be set aside. Acting on a Union complaint, the Board's General Counsel issued an unfair labor practice complaint and the Board granted its motion for summary judgment against North Atlantic. The Board found that North Atlantic had not produced any new evidence or special circumstances requiring the Board to alter its earlier decision that Custer's activities did not taint the representation proceedings. The Board concluded that North Atlantic's refusal to bargain with the Union violated the Act and again ordered North Atlantic to bargain with the Union and to cease and desist from interfering with, restraining, or coercing employees in the exercise of their rights under the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its petition for enforcement, the Board seeks summary affirmance of its findings that North Atlantic committed several unfair labor practices, which North Atlantic does not challenge on appeal. Further, the Board seeks affirmance of its finding that the Union achieved a valid card majority which, combined with the numerous unfair labor practices, led the Board to certify the Union as the exclusive bargaining representative; that certification formed the basis of the Board's remedial bargaining order and refusal to bargain unfair labor practices finding in 1995. The Board also requests affirmance of its finding that North Atlantic violated the Act by refusing to bargain with the Union after it won the election and was again certified as the exclusive bargaining agent in 1999. North Atlantic seeks review of the Board's orders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ultimate issue here is whether North Atlantic has an obligation to bargain with the Union, as ordered by the Board. There are two bases for the Board's bargaining orders. First, there is a Gissel bargaining order, which provides a basis for a bargaining order irrespective of the outcome of the election because the Board found North Atlantic had committed massive unfair labor practices, sufficient to render a fair election improbable, and the Union had obtained an authorization card majority. See NLRB v. Gissel Packaging Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107970\"><a href=\"/opinion/107970/nlrb-v-gissel-packing-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span>, 600, 610, 613 (1969) (Board can impose bargaining obligation on employer which refuses to recognize union that has obtained card majority and commits unfair labor practices \"likely to destroy the union's majority and seriously impede the election\"). Second, an election was held and the Union won, and so that is another basis for the obligation to bargain. See NLRB v. Horizon Air Servs., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"451687\"><a href=\"/opinion/451687/national-labor-relations-board-v-horizon-air-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">761</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 28 (1st Cir. 1985). North Atlantic seeks to undermine both of these grounds for the bargaining orders with the same argument: the pro-union activities of the supervisor constituted a threat, albeit indirect, to employees that if they did not vote for the union there would be consequences, and so it cannot be said there was a fair and free choice made. Because the parties have done so, we treat the analysis of the two grounds as the same; any variations are not material for resolution of the issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Normally in representation cases, our review of the NLRB determinations is for abuse of discretion.

See, e.g., Wright Memorial Hosp. v. NLRB, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"457663\"><a href=\"/opinion/457663/wright-memorial-hospital-v-national-labor-relations-board-region-17/\"><span class=\"volume\">771</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">400</span></a></span> (8th Cir. 1985); NLRB v.

Here, the Board ruled that the individual was a supervisor. A pro-union supervisor presents two possible scenarios which could interfere with a fair and free election. The first is confusion; the second is coercion. There may be confusion felt by employees about the message from management if one of management's own, a supervisor, urges the union upon employees. Or there may be a second effect, that a supervisor may explicitly or implicitly coerce employees into voting for the union. See Fall River Sav. Bank, 649 F.2d at 56 (employees might support union \"out of fear of retaliation\" by pro-union supervisor).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case does not raise the first concern. The employer left no one in doubt of its anti-union position, as the uncontested findings of unfair labor practices against it attest. Indeed, supervisor Custer, in his debut on this issue, warned other employees that North Atlantic president was virulently anti-union. Accord Catholic Med. Ctr. v. NLRB, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"377159\"><a href=\"/opinion/377159/the-catholic-medical-center-of-brooklyn-and-queens-inc-mary-immaculate/\"><span class=\"volume\">620</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 22 (2d Cir. 1980) (supervisor's support of union posed no risk of confusion about employer's position in view of its \"vigorous campaign against the Union\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And so we turn to the second concern: whether there has been explicit or implicit coercion. While this Circuit has not had an abundance of these cases, the few existing decisions establish the principle that \"without evidence of any threats, express or implied, [the fact that supervisors favor a union ] does not compel a finding of coercion.\" Fall River Sav. Bank, 649 F.2d at 57, quoted in Northeastern Univ., 707 F.2d at 18. Both sides make rather too much of this statement, since it pertains only to whether such evidence alone would compel a finding of coercion, contrary to the Board's conclusion that there was no coercion. It is, for example, equally true that the fact that the employer opposes a union does not compel a finding of coercion. That is different from the question of whether the Board could find implicit coercion from the fact that a strong supervisor was pro-union. It is also very different from the question that concerns us: whether the Board's finding is supportable that a pro-union supervisor, by his conduct and his speech, did not invalidate free choice. But there is an important point: when the factual predicates for the Board's decisions are attacked, they may not be set aside unless the record compels a different conclusion, and so it can be said that the decision is not supported by \"substantial evidence.\" NLRB v. Hosp. San Pablo, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768062\"><a href=\"/opinion/768062/national-labor-relations-board-v-hospital-san-pablo-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">207</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></a></span>, 70 (1st Cir. 2000) (court must accept Board's factual findings \"unless those findings are not supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole\") (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). We evaluate the Board's finding by examination of certain factors set forth in Board and court cases involving claims of coercion or reward by pro-union supervisors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The initial focus is on whether there were coercive actions by the supervisor against anti-union employees, actions such as discharge, surveillance, coercive investigation, or rewards. Similarly, courts focus on whether there were words that amounted to an express threat or promise of reward. SeeGissel, 395 U.S. at 615. This case involves none of these. Cf.Comcast Cablevision, 232 F.3d at 495 (reversing NLRB and invalidating election where union offered employees free weekend trip at the union's expense).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, this case involves the more subtle question of whether the conduct and speech of the supervisor amounted to implicit threats or coercion. The Board has generally considered the specific facts and circumstances and looked to three areas of inquiry: the nature of the supervisory authority, the nature of the activity and speech of the supervisor, and the context in which the supervisor acted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first line of inquiry looks to the scope of the supervisor's role over the employees to determine whether the supervisor has the actual ability to harm the interests of the employees or to reward them. See Fall River Sav. Bank, 649 F.2d at 57 (Board relied on limited power of branch managers to retaliate against tellers in finding no coercion); cf.Harborside Healthcare, Inc. v. NLRB, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770849\"><a href=\"/opinion/770849/harborside-healthcare-inc-petitionercross-respondent-v-national-labor/\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">206</span></a></span>, 210-11 (6th Cir. 2000) (analyzing nature of supervisory authority to determine whether effect of charge nurse's conduct was coercive). There is nothing unreasonable about such an inquiry; indeed, an immediate low-level supervisor may have much more actual power to coerce or to reward than someone with a higher title in the corporate totem pole. This line of inquiry generally involves questions about the role of the supervisor in hiring, firing, wages, promotions, and other job benefits. Here, the Administrative Law Judge made exactly this inquiry, albeit on the question of whether Custer was a supervisor at all, and concluded that Custer \"had the authority to effectively recommend personnel actions with respect to raises, hiring, discipline and overtime and he responsibly directed employees in at least some respects.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The period of time that this supervisory authority existed is also relevant. The ALJ noted that Custer was terminated by North Atlantic early in the organizing campaign. Although Custer continued to attend union meetings, he no longer had workplace authority. The ALJ acknowledged that this fact alone was not dispositive in the Union's favor, given the precedent of NLRB v. Howard Johnson Motor Lodge, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"417758\"><a href=\"/opinion/417758/national-labor-relations-board-v-howard-johnson-motor-lodge/\"><span class=\"volume\">705</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">932</span></a></span> (7th Cir. 1983). There, a hearing was held on claims of taint resulting from the pro-union activity by a supervisor who was fired. Unlike here, there was a reasonable chance the supervisor would be returned to her position as a supervisor, thus raising the possibility of coercion. Here, there was, to quote the ALJ, \"no realistic possibility\" of such coercion because the Union's claim that Custer had been wrongly fired depended on Custer being characterized as an employee and not as a supervisor. If Custer had been returned to work as a result of the Union's filing of an unfair labor practice charge, his position would have been as an employee, not a supervisor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second area of inquiry has to do with a very fact-intensive examination of the activities and speech of the supervisor. The ALJ found that Custer's pro-union activity was very limited: he attended union meetings, but when he spoke, it was mostly to say that the employees would have a tough time getting a union given the attitude of North Atlantic president. Custer's most explicit statements of union support came, not surprisingly, after he had been fired. He had no supervisory authority then. The ALJ also noted the lack of certain evidence. There was no evidence, for example, that Custer passed out or collected authorization cards, campaigned for the Union while he was a supervisor, or made promises or engaged in any form of coercion to further his pro-union views. And there was no evidence from which it could be reasonably inferred that other employees felt Custer was trying to force them to support the Union.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this last point, there is an evidentiary refinement. The Supreme Court in Gissel cautioned against after-the-fact evidence from employees as to whether they had felt coerced in any way, noting that even that testimony could be subject to coercion. See 395 U.S. at 608 (employee's testimony about subjective perception of coercion may be unreliable due to employee's desire to curry favor with employer). We understand the ALJ to have kept this principle in mind and to be referring to other evidence from which such coercion could be inferred. But despite the caution in Gissel, it is also clear that on the question of whether someone is a supervisor, the perceptions of other employees may be taken into account. See Fall River Sav. Bank, 649 F.2d at 57 n.7 (relying on employees' testimony in determining lack of threat); cf. Int'l Assoc. of Machinists v. NLRB, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">311</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span></span>, 79-80 (1940) (acts of perceived supervisors are to be accorded same weight as acts of actual supervisors if acting as agents of employer in election cases). Since many of these cases involve both questions -- supervisory coercion and supervisory status -- there is no bright line evidentiary rule permitting or excluding such evidence per se. Cf. NLRB v. Chicago Metallic Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"472240\"><a href=\"/opinion/472240/national-labor-relations-board-v-chicago-metallic-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">794</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">527</span></a></span>, 531 (9th Cir. 1986) (appropriate in \"borderline cases\" to consider whether person is perceived as a supervisor).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, there is an examination of context. As the ALJ found, North Atlantic had itself engaged in coercion and discrimination in an effort to stop the Union. In this context, \"the employees could not possibly believe . . . that they had anything to fear by offending Custer and opposing the Union.\" Again, there was no suggestion that this fact of North Atlantic's strong anti-unionism was dispositive. It may well be that a supervisor could engage in pro-union coercion even while the company is virulently anti-union. See WKRG-TV, 470 F.2d at 1315, n.8 (\"[R]easonable fear of supervisory retaliation can be present even if the company hierarchy has openly opposed the union.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewing all the facts, the Board concluded there was no conduct or speech by supervisor Custer that would give rise to an inference of coercion, and therefore no basis to invalidate either the authorization cards or the election. The Board's determination of whether a supervisor's conduct tainted an election is \"essentially a matter of drawing inferences, and it has long been settled that an agency's conclusions based upon such inferences should not be set aside by a reviewing court unless they transgress the bounds of reason.\" Catholic Med. Ctr., 620 F.2d at 22. Here, the Board's conclusion is reasonable and very far from an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">North Atlantic attacks this conclusion by saying that it has been held to too high a standard of proof. All it needs to show, it says, relying on the Ninth Circuit decision in Island Film, is that the pro-union supervisory activity would \"reasonably tend\" to have a coercive effect, and does not need to show actual proof of coercion. It also says that in most of these sorts of cases, where management loses, management is aware of what its wayward supervisors are doing and does nothing in response. See NLRB v. Lamar Electric Membership Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"272240\"><a href=\"/opinion/272240/national-labor-relations-board-v-lamar-electric-membership-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">362</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">505</span></a></span>, 506-07 (5th Cir. 1966) (\"[W]here the employer knows of the advocacy and takes no steps to dissipate its effect, such advocacy may not be used as a basis for setting aside the election.\"); see also Fall River Sav. Bank, 649 F.2d at 56 n.5 (employer who fails to exercise authority over known pro-union activities by supervisor \"may not later be heard to complain of the results of its inaction\"). North Atlantic should not be put in that category, it says, because it did not know what Custer was doing until the day of the election. More than that, it says, North Atlantic should prevail because it had no opportunity to respond to what Custer was doing. The harm Custer did, North Atlantic argues, is magnified because the bargaining unit was very small and only a few votes would make a difference in the outcome.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are three difficulties with North Atlantic's argument. First, it makes no allowance for the fact that judicial review is deferential to the Board, unless the Board's decision is \"arbitrary and capricious\" or its findings not supported by substantial evidence. NLRB v. Beverly Enterprises-Massachusetts, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763315\"><a href=\"/opinion/763315/national-labor-relations-board-v-beverly-enterprises-massachusetts-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">174</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 34 (1st Cir. 1999). There is no serious claim that the Board's position violates the Act, cf. NLRB v. Health Care &amp; Retirement Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087953\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087953/nlrb-v-health-care-retirement-corp-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">571</span></a></span>, 574-584 (1994), or that it is an unreasonable interpretation of an ambiguous statute, see NLRB v. Hilliard Development Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198566\"><a href=\"/opinion/198566/nlrb-v-hilliard-development/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></a></span>, 140-41 (1st Cir. 1999). The decision is neither arbitrary and capricious nor unsupported. Secondly, the facts as found by the ALJ simply do not raise the questions posed by North Atlantic. The ALJ found that the activities of the supervisor were so minimal that no \"reasonable possibility\" of taint emerged. That was so whether or not management knew of Custer's activities. Thirdly, we think that North Atlantic may overread Island Films. We do not, initially, read it as saying that no proof of coercion, either express or implied, need be offered.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Although Island Films purported to establish a standard that \"[s]upervisory activity need only 'reasonably tend' to have a coercive effect on or 'likely to impair' [sic] an employee's choice,\" 784 F.2d at 1451, we do not take that language as intended to establish a new standard of judicial review, as North Atlantic here suggests, apart from the usual abuse of discretion and substantial evidence standard, which we apply. The Ninth Circuit itself has disavowed these two readings of Island Film. See Napili Shores Condominium Homeowners' Ass'n v. NLRB, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"565097\"><a href=\"/opinion/565097/napili-shores-condominium-homeowners-association-and-napili-shores-rental/\"><span class=\"volume\">939</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">717</span></a></span>, 718-19 (9th Cir. 1991) (applying usual deferential standard and holding that pro-union supervisory participation does not per se invalidate election).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we grant the Board's petition for enforcement of its orders and dismiss North Atlantic's petition for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Stearns represented the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, AFL-CIO.

Cf. NLRB v. WKRG-TV, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"307236\"><a href=\"/opinion/307236/national-labor-relations-board-v-wkrg-tv-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1302</span></a></span>, 1313-15 (5th Cir. 1973).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> It is theoretically possible, of course, that other employees might nonetheless perceive him, despite his being characterized by the ALJ as an employee, to have some sort of supervisory power over them. This case, as the facts described later show, does not raise any such issue of perceived authority.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> If, on the other hand, we misunderstand Island Film and it does hold that mere supervisory status alone compels a finding of coercion, or to use the language of that opinion, that such status alone is sufficient to show that the activity reasonably tends to have a coercive effect, then the Board is correct that such a rule is in conflict with First Circuit law, by which we are bound.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
