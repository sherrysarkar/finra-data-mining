The  district court  sentenced Leppo  to 37\r\n\nmonths in prison and ordered him to pay some  $2.6 million in\r\n\nrestitution to fifteen  different victims.  On  appeal, Leppo\r\n\nchallenges both his sentence  and the restitution order.   We\r\n\naffirm.\r\n\n          1.  Downward Departure\r                                            \r\n\n          Leppo requested a downward departure under U.S.S.G.\r\n\n  5K2.13,  based on psychiatric testimony that a pathological\r\n\ngambling compulsion had motivated his crimes.  He argues that\r\n\nthe district court  refused to depart under    5K2.13 because\r\n\nit erroneously believed that it  lacked authority to do so on\r\n\nthe basis of Leppo s gambling disorder.   Contrary to Leppo s\r\n\ncharacterization, however, the court explicitly stated at the\r\n\nsentencing hearing that it  did have the discretion  to grant\r                                           \r\n\nLeppo s requested departure,  but that it found  the exercise\r\n\nof such discretion to be inappropriate in this case.   We are\r\n\nwithout  jurisdiction  to  review  the court s  discretionary\r\n\nrefusal to depart.  See United States v. Rizzo, 121 F.3d 794,\r                                                          \r\n\n798 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\n\n          Second, Leppo argued below that this  case featured\r\n\n\"unusual\" mitigating circumstances that placed it outside the\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\n\"heartland\" of the applicable guidelines (U.S.S.G.    2B5.3 &amp;\r\n\n2F1.1), in that the aggregate retail value of his counterfeit\r\n\ngoods -- which was the  predicate for a 14-step offense level\r\n\nenhancement   --  had  plummeted  between  the  time  of  the\r\n\ninfringing sales and the time of sentencing.   Leppo contends\r\n\nthat  the district  court  misconstrued  his  argument  as  a\r\n\nrequest  for  downward   departure  under  U.S.S.G.    2F1.1,\r\n\napplication note 10.\r\n\n          We  see  no  indication that  the  court  failed to\r\n\ncomprehend Leppo s position.  It is evident that the district\r\n\ncourt, observing that Leppo actually profited from the higher\r                                                         \r\n\nretail prices prevailing at the time of his offenses,  simply\r\n\ndeclined  to attach any  relevance to the  post-offense price\r\n\nfluctuations  at issue.  The court  therefore had no occasion\r\n\nto  consider   whether  those   fluctuations  constituted   a\r\n\n\"mitigating circumstance\"  warranting an  unguided departure;\r\n\nobviously,  an irrelevant  circumstance  cannot mitigate  the\r                                                                    \r\n\nseriousness  of  an  offense.   The  court s  construction of\r\n\nLeppo s argument as a request for departure under application\r\n\nnote  10  to    2F1.1  strikes  us  as  a  rather  charitable\r\n\nreformulation of Leppo s position,  not a misunderstanding of\r\n\nit.  Because  the court s denial of  Leppo s second departure\r\n\nrequest was not  based on any legal or  factual mistake, that\r\n\ndecision similarly is not subject  to our review.  See Rizzo,\r                                                                        \r\n\n121 F.3d at 798.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          2.  Restitution\r                                     \r\n\n          Leppo raises  two  challenges  to  the  restitution\r\n\norder, both for the first time on appeal.  He argues (1) that\r\n\nthe district court failed to evaluate his ability to pay, and\r\n\n(2)  that the order  overcompensated one of  Leppo s victims,\r\n\nIBM.  We agree with  the government that Leppo clearly waived\r                                                                         \r\n\nhis  first argument,  and  probably  waived  the  second,  by\r\n\nspecifically stating at  the disposition hearing that  he was\r\n\ncontent to \"leave any restitution order  to the discretion of\r\n\nthe court.\"\r\n\n          Even if Leppo s second argument was not waived, our\r\n\nreview would be limited to plain error.  See United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nMitchell, 85 F.3d  800, 807 (1st Cir. 1996).   Leppo suggests\r                    \r\n\nthat there is a \"substantial risk\" that the restitution order\r\n\novercompensates IBM because IBM may have recouped some of its\r\n\nlosses, but he fails even to hint at a reasonable estimate of\r\n\nthe amount that IBM actually might have recouped; nor does he\r\n\ndescribe  any  plausible,  practical  method  by  which   the\r\n\ndistrict court  could have  calculated that amount.   In  any\r\n\nevent, the district court was  not required to fix the amount\r\n\nof its restitution order with absolute precision.  See United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Vaknin, 112  F.3d 579, 587 (1st Cir. 1997).   Here,\r                            \r\n\nthe  record clearly  reflects  that  the  court  undertook  a\r\n\ndetailed review of  the evidence in calculating the amount of\r\n\nloss  suffered by IBM.

Leppo suggests\r                    \r\n\nthat there is a \"substantial risk\" that the restitution order\r\n\novercompensates IBM because IBM may have recouped some of its\r\n\nlosses, but he fails even to hint at a reasonable estimate of\r\n\nthe amount that IBM actually might have recouped; nor does he\r\n\ndescribe  any  plausible,  practical  method  by  which   the\r\n\ndistrict court  could have  calculated that amount.   In  any\r\n\nevent, the district court was  not required to fix the amount\r\n\nof its restitution order with absolute precision.  See United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.

Here,\r                            \r\n\nthe  record clearly  reflects  that  the  court  undertook  a\r\n\ndetailed review of  the evidence in calculating the amount of\r\n\nloss  suffered by IBM.
