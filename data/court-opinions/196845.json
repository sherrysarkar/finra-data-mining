Katz was\r\n\nhired by City Metal on July  1, 1991.  On September 27, 1992,\r\n\nhe  suffered  a  heart  attack.

City Metal hired him in\r\n\nJuly of 1991 as a scrap  metal salesman because of his  prior\r\n\nexperience in the field.  He was assigned various territories\r\n\nwhich he serviced by traveling in a company car.   At the end\r\n\nof  1991,  Bruno asked  Katz to  take  an inside  position in\r\n\ncustomer relations as a  liaison between the company and  its\r\n\ncustomers.   Katz  accepted  and continued  in that  position\r\n\nuntil July  of 1992.   During that  time Katz also  helped to\r\n\ntrain  Wilcox, who was new to the business, and trained other\r\n\nsalesmen.  In July of 1992, Katz, at his request, returned to\r\n\nbeing a salesman.  Up until  the time he was discharged, Katz\r\n\ndid not  receive any negative  reports or comments  about the\r\n\nquality  of his performance and was not informed that his job\r\n\nwas in jeopardy.\r\n\n          On Sunday,  September 27,  1992, while Katz  was in\r\n\nCleveland  visiting his family, he had a heart attack and was\r\n\ntaken by  ambulance  to the  Cleveland  Clinic.   During  his\r\n\nseven-day   stay  there,   Katz  underwent   two  angioplasty\r\n\nprocedures  and  some  testing,   and  was  kept  in  cardiac\r\n\nintensive  care.   He  was discharged  from  the hospital  on\r\n\nSaturday,  October  3, 1991,  and  telephoned  Wilcox on  the\r\n\nfollowing Monday to  explain the situation.  Wilcox then sent\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nKatz  Rhode  Island temporary  disability  application forms.\r\n\nKatz submitted them and  received disability payments for six\r\n\nmonths, the maximum payable under Rhode Island law.\r\n\n          After his  discharge from  the  hospital, Katz  had\r\n\ngreat difficulty breathing, even  while sitting down, and was\r\n\nextremely limited in his ability to walk.  After a few steps,\r\n\nhe became short  of breath and experienced chest pains, broke\r\n\ninto  sweats and became nauseous.   It was  necessary that he\r\n\nkeep stress to a minimum.  \r\n\n          Katz  went to  the company  office on  the Thursday\r\n\nafternoon following his hospital discharge for the purpose of\r\n\ndiscussing his  return to work.   Due to  the effects  of his\r\n\nheart attack, Katz was unable to walk to the company's office\r\n\non  the second floor.   Wilcox therefore came  down to Katz's\r\n\ncar, where the two had a conversation.  Katz asked  about his\r\n\ncustomers and told Wilcox he wanted to return to work as soon\r\n\nas  possible, even if it was initially in a limited capacity.\r\n\nWilcox  told him not to  worry about his  customers, and that\r\n\nthe main thing was for Katz to get well.\r\n\n          Katz  stayed in Rhode Island for about a week after\r\n\nhis  conversation with  Wilcox.   The cold  weather, however,\r\n\nrestricted his  breathing which,  in turn, made  walking even\r\n\nmore difficult.   Since Wilcox  had told him  that his  first\r\n\nobjective  should be to get well,  Katz decided to recuperate\r\n\nat his family's apartment in Miami, Florida.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n          On Friday, the last  working day of October, Wilcox\r\n\ntelephoned  Katz and told him  that he was  discharged.  Katz\r\n\ncalled Wilcox the  following Monday and offered  to return to\r\n\nwork on  a part-time basis with a  reduction in salary and to\r\n\naccept whatever accommodations the company would make.\r\n\n          At the time of  the trial in October of  1995, Katz\r\n\nstill  had  some trouble  breathing  and  walking.    He  was\r\n\nworking,  having obtained a job on February 17, 1995 (after a\r\n\nlengthy search  beginning in January of  1993), selling bonds\r\n\nfor the State of Israel.\r\n\n          Katz also called Wilcox as a witness.  He testified\r\n\nthat Katz's brother called to tell him about the heart attack\r\n\ntwo days after it occurred, and that he never questioned that\r\n\nKatz had a heart attack.  He testified that Katz looked tired\r\n\nwhen he  met him in  the parking lot,  and that he  told Katz\r\n\nthat  his  main objective  should  be  to  recover.    Wilcox\r\n\ntestified, however,  that  he had  decided  to fire  Katz  on\r\n\nSeptember 4, 1992 (prior to the heart attack), for failing to\r\n\nsubmit  a weekly travel schedule as required, and that he had\r\n\nmerely waited until  the end  of October to  so inform  Katz.\r\n\nKatz  also called Bruno as  a witness, who  testified that he\r\n\nwas instrumental in  hiring Katz, but  was not familiar  with\r\n\nthe circumstances of his termination.\r\n\n               The Judgment As A Matter Of Law\r                           The Judgment As A Matter Of Law\r                                                          \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n          After Katz, Wilcox, and Bruno had testified, Katz's\r\n\nattorney informed the court  that he had one more  witness --\r\n\nKatz's  treating physician  in Rhode  Island --  whom he  had\r\n\nsubpoenaed for  the following day.  The  court recessed until\r\n\nthe following  day, when  Katz's attorney informed  the court\r\n\nthat the doctor had declined to appear in court until Friday,\r\n\nthree  days  hence, and  requested  that he  be  permitted to\r\n\npresent  the  doctor's   testimony  in  rebuttal  after   the\r\n\ndefendants' case.  The  court stated that it would  deal with\r\n\nthe  issue  when  it arose  and  was  not  sure the  doctor's\r\n\ntestimony was \"vital to the essence of your claim.\"  \r\n\n          When  asked to  state its  position on  the matter,\r\n\nCity Metal stated that it had received Katz's medical records\r\n\nand that it did not dispute that Katz suffered a heart attack\r\n\nor that it  perceived that  he suffered a  heart attack,  but\r\n\nthat it did  contest that Katz  was actually disabled  within\r\n\nthe meaning of the ADA.  At that point, the court stated that\r\n\nKatz  could not  prove  that  he  was  disabled  without  the\r\n\ntestimony of his  doctor, and Katz  again requested either  a\r\n\ncontinuance or  that the  doctor be permitted  to testify  in\r\n\nrebuttal.  The court denied those requests and Katz rested.\r\n\n          City Metal  then moved for judgment as  a matter of\r\n\nlaw,  arguing that in order  to prove a  disability under the\r\n\nADA and the Rhode Island Fair Employment Practices  Act, Katz\r\n\nwas  required  to  show   that  the  heart  attack  \"severely\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nrestricted  a   basic  life  activity  on   a  permanent  and\r\n\ncontinuing  basis,\" and that he  had failed to  do so because\r\n\nthere had been no medical testimony that Katz was permanently\r\n\nimpaired  in a major life activity.  In response, Katz argued\r\n\nthat his testimony established that the heart attack resulted\r\n\nin  hospitalization, and  impaired  his  ability to  breathe,\r\n\nwalk, perform manual  tasks, care for  himself and work,  and\r\n\nthat the evidence therefore met each of the three alternative\r\n\ndefinitions of the term \"disability\" under the ADA -- that he\r\n\nhad a  physical impairment that substantially  limited one or\r\n\nmore major life  activities, that he had a record  of such an\r\n\nimpairment, and that  City Metal regarded him  as having such\r\n\nan impairment.  See 42 U.S.C.   12102(2).\r                               \r\n\n          The district court ruled as follows:\r\n\n          The  question is  whether  it produced  a\r\n          permanent   disability   that  he   can't\r\n          perform  his work.   It's obvious  he's a\r\n          salesman, and  he's still selling. .  . .\r\n          In order for the Plaintiff to recover  in\r\n          this  case, the  Plaintiff  must  make  a\r\n          showing   that  he   has  some   type  of\r\n          permanent impairment, physical impairment\r\n          in   one  or   more   of   life's   major\r\n          activities.   There's been no  showing of\r\n          that in this case.\r\n\n          The  only  evidence  is  that  he  has  a\r\n          blocked  artery  that  was  opened  up by\r\n          balloon  angioplasty.  That does not show\r\n          that  he has  a  permanent disability  or\r\n          heart disease.  I know.  I've been there.\r\n          I had a heart attack.\r\n\n          People recover from heart attacks  and go\r\n          on with life's  functions.  I  know, I've\r\n          done  it, and  I had  an artery  that was\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\n          completely  blocked   and  not  reopened.\r\n          Because  I went  through a  rehab program\r\n          where I developed the collateral arteries\r\n          to take over the function of that artery,\r\n          now I  can perform.

We start with the words of the statute.  The Americans\r\n\nwith  Disabilities Act  is  a federal  civil rights  statute,\r\n\nenacted  \"to  provide  a  clear  and  comprehensive  national\r\n\nmandate   for  the  elimination   of  discrimination  against\r\n\nindividuals with  disabilities.\"   42  U.S.C.    12101(b)(1).\r\n\nSee also Grenier v.

In  the  employment  context,  the  ADA\r\n\nprohibits a \"covered entity\" (defined as \"a person engaged in\r\n\nan industry affecting commerce who has 15 or more employees\")\r\n\nfrom \"discriminat[ing] against a qualified individual  with a\r\n\ndisability because  of the  disability of such  individual in\r\n\nregard   to   job   application   procedures,   the   hiring,\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nadvancement,    or    discharge   of    employees,   employee\r\n\ncompensation, job training, and other terms,  conditions, and\r\n\nprivileges  of employment.\"  42 U.S.C.   12112(a).  To obtain\r\n\nrelief under the  Act, a plaintiff  must prove three  things.\r\n\nFirst,  that he was disabled  within the meaning  of the Act.\r\n\nSecond, that with or  without reasonable accommodation he was\r\n\nable  to perform  the essential  functions of  his job.   And\r\n\nthird, that the employer  discharged him in whole or  in part\r\n\nbecause of his disability.2  \r\n\n          In light  of the district court's  ruling, we focus\r\n\non the first  element --  \"disability\" -- as  defined in  the\r\n\nADA:\r\n\n          The term \"disability\" means, with respect\r\n          to an individual -- \r\n\n          (A)  a physical or mental impairment that\r\n          substantially limits  one or more  of the\r\n          major life activities of such individual;\r\n\n          (B) a record of such an impairment; or \r\n\n          (C)  being  regarded  as having  such  an\r\n          impairment.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.

This does not, however,  necessarily\r\n\nlead  to  the conclusion  that Katz  had  a disability.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nMcDonald v.

We  think  that  it would  be\r\n\ndifficult for a  lay jury  to conclude, based  solely on  the\r\n\nimmediate effects of a heart attack and angioplasty procedure\r\n\non Katz,  that those limitations were  permanent or persisted\r\n\non a long-term basis,  or that their duration was  indefinite\r\n\nand unknowable or  expected to  be at  least several  months.\r\n\nKatz was apparently prepared  to present medical testimony to\r\n\nthis effect  but, as  already noted,  his medical  expert was\r\n\nunavailable and the court declined to delay the trial.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nId. at 23.

Some\r\n\nlong-term impairments would be obvious to a lay jury (e.g., a\r                                                                      \r\n\nmissing  arm)  and  it  is  certainly  within  the  realm  of\r\n\npossibility that  a plaintiff himself in  a disabilities case\r\n\nmight  offer a description of treatments  and symptoms over a\r\n\nsubstantial  period that  would put  the jury  in  a position\r\n\nwhere it could determine that he did suffer from a disability\r\n\nwithin the meaning  of the ADA.  On this  record, we think it\r\n\nis a much closer  case whether Katz put such  evidence before\r\n\nthe jury.\r\n\n          The  bulk  of the  evidence  as  to Katz's  medical\r\n\ncondition  related primarily  to  his  situation  immediately\r\n\nafter the  operation, including his initial  effort to return\r\n\nto work  in which he was  so stricken that he  could not even\r\n\nleave the car and climb up a flight of stairs  to the office.\r\n\nKatz did testify that even  three years after the  operation,\r\n\nhe still felt in  poor condition; but that testimony  was far\r\n\nmore  general  and  far  less  specific  than  his  testimony\r\n\nregarding the impact of the  heart attack in the month or  so\r\n\nimmediately following its occurrence. \r\n\n          We think it  was unwise for  the district court  to\r\n\ninvoke   its  own  medical   experience  in   explaining  its\r\n\ndetermination that Katz's evidence was inadequate, since  the\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\ndetermination of whether an impairment substantially limits a\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nmajor activity must be made on an individual basis:  \r\n\n          The    determination   of    whether   an\r\n          individual  has a  disability  is  . .  .\r\n          based  .  .  .  on  the  effect  of  that\r\n          impairment on the life of the individual.\r\n          Some  impairments  may  be disabling  for\r\n          particular   individuals   but  not   for\r\n          others.\r\n\n29 C.F.R.

Nonetheless,  it is  at least  a debatable\r\n\nquestion whether,  based on Katz's testimony,  the jury could\r\n\nconclude  that   he  suffered   from  a  continuing   medical\r\n\ncondition, persisting beyond the period immediately after the\r\n\noperation,  that substantially  limited  one or  more of  his\r\n\nmajor life activities.  \r\n\n          We  need  not  definitively  resolve  the issue  of\r\n\nwhether expert  medical testimony was necessary  for the case\r\n\nto go forward on a theory of actual disability in this  case,\r\n\nbecause we think  that the evidence  permitted Katz to  reach\r\n\nthe  jury  under  one   of  the  alternative  definitions  of\r\n\ndisability, that  City Metal \"regarded [Katz]  as having such\r\n\nan  impairment.\"    41  U.S.C.     12102(2)(C).    Under  the\r\n\nregulations an individual  who has an impairment  that is not\r\n\nsubstantially  limiting  (or has  no  impairment  at all)  is\r\n\nnevertheless  \"disabled\" if he is  treated by the employer as\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nhaving an impairment that does substantially limit major life\r\n\nactivities.  29 C.F.R.    1630.2(l)(1).

The\r\n\ndramatic encounter at the office, in which Katz was unable to\r\n\nclimb the stairs and Wilcox observed his fatigue, is only one\r\n\npiece  of evidence; others  included the employer's knowledge\r\n\nof    the   heart    attack,   angioplasty    procedure   and\r\n\nhospitalization, and yet another was Katz's own statements to\r\n\nhis employer that when  he returned to work it would at least\r\n\ninitially  have to be  in a  limited capacity.

Hamm v.\r                                                                         \r\n\nRunyon, 51 F.3d 721, 724-26 (7th Cir. 1995) (employer did not\r                  \r\n\n\"regard\"  employee as  disabled where  there was  no evidence\r\n\nthat the  person who made  the decision to fire  him was even\r\n\ntold about the employee's arthritis; employee told his direct\r\n\nsupervisor  that  it  was  \"nothing\"  and  \"would  pass\"  and\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\ncontinued to  do all of the  functions of his job).   Even if\r\n\nmedical  expert testimony  were required  here to  permit the\r\n\njury  to  find that  Katz  was  suffering from  a  continuing\r\n\nserious  heart condition,  the  jury certainly  did not  need\r\n\nmedical testimony in making  its own judgment as to  what the\r\n\nemployer may have perceived, rightly or wrongly, about Katz's\r\n\ncondition.\r\n\n          When the district  court proposed  to withdraw  the\r\n\ncase from the jury and  direct a verdict, Katz argued to  the\r\n\ncourt  that regardless  of actual  medical condition,  he had\r\n\nprovided a basis for  the jury to conclude that  the employer\r\n\nperceived him to  be disabled.   The judge  did not  directly\r\n\nrespond  to this assertion.   Katz has renewed  it on appeal,\r\n\nbut City Metal's brief also fails  to respond in any depth to\r\n\nthe perception argument.  At least on this record, we have to\r\n\nconclude  that Katz did provide  enough evidence to reach the\r\n\njury on the issue of perception which, as already noted, does\r\n\nconstitute disability within the meaning of the Act.\r\n\n          Congress, when it provided for perception to be the\r\n\nbasis of disability status,  probably had principally in mind\r\n\nthe  more usual  case in  which a  plaintiff has  a long-term\r\n\nmedical condition of some  kind, and the employer exaggerates\r\n\nits   significance   by   failing   to   make  a   reasonable\r\n\naccommodation.   But  both  the language  and  policy of  the\r\n\nstatute seem to us to offer protection as well to  one who is\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\nnot substantially disabled  or even  disabled at  all but  is\r\n\nwrongly perceived to be so.   And, of course, it may  well be\r\n\nthat Katz was both actually disabled and perceived to be so.\r\n\n          The second  element of proof is  ability to perform\r\n\nthe essential functions of the job with or without reasonable\r\n\naccommodation.   See 42 U.S.C.    12111(8).   Katz  testified\r                                \r\n\nthat  five days  after his  discharge from  the  hospital and\r\n\nagain  two  days  after he  was  fired,  he  asked Wilcox  to\r\n\naccommodate him by allowing him to return to  work on a part-\r\n\ntime  basis.    On  the  latter occasion,  Katz  suggested  a\r\n\nreduction  in  salary  and  said  he  would  accept  whatever\r\n\naccommodations the  company would make  in order to  keep his\r\n\njob.   Reasonable  accommodations include,  inter alia,  \"job\r                                                                  \r\n\nrestructuring  [and] part-time  or modified  work schedules.\"\r\n\n42 U.S.C.    12111(9).  As  we noted in  Grenier v.  Cyanamid\r                                                                         \r\n\nPlastics, Inc.:\r                          \r\n\n          With   respect  to   known  disabilities,\r\n          however, the emphasis  is on  encouraging\r\n          the employer to \"engage in an interactive\r\n          process with the individual  to determine\r\n          an  effective  reasonable accommodation.\"\r\n          Guidance   IV.B.6b  (citing H.R.

Katz's suggestions  were rejected  out of\r\n\nhand.  The district judge did not say that Katz had failed to\r\n\nshow  that   he  could   perform  his  job   with  reasonable\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\naccommodations, nor does City Metal offer  any argument as to\r\n\nthis element on appeal.5  \r\n\n          The third  element of plaintiff's  case, that  Katz\r\n\nwas fired because of a disability, or that his disability was\r\n\na motivating  factor in  City Metal's  decision to  fire him,\r\n\nPedigo v.  P.A.M. Transport, Inc.,  60 F.3d  1300, 1301  (8th\r                                            \r\n\nCir. 1995),  also was a question  of fact for the  jury.  The\r\n\ntiming  of Katz's firing,  one month after  his heart attack,\r\n\nwas circumstantial  evidence from  which the jury  could find\r\n\nthat Katz's disability  triggered, in whole  or in part,  his\r\n\nfiring by City Metal.\r\n\n          We rule  that the court erred  in granting judgment\r\n\nas a matter of law for City Metal, because the evidence would\r\n\npermit the  conclusion that Katz established  that City Metal\r\n\nregarded  him  as   having  an   impairment  constituting   a\r\n\ndisability under section  12102(2)(C) of the  Act.  Thus,  he\r\n\nproved a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA and\r                                \r\n\nthe Rhode Island Fair Employment Practices Act. \r\n\n          Where  there must be a  remand for a  new trial, we\r\n\nhave broad authority to draft a remand order that is fair and\r\n\njust.  28  U.S.C.   2106.  In this  instance, given that Katz\r\n\nwas  deprived  of  his  medical  testimony  more  or  less by\r\n\naccident, we  see no reason  why on retrial he  should not be\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  City Metal was free,  of course, to attempt to  show that\r\naccommodating  Katz  would  have  imposed  on  it  an  \"undue\r\nhardship.\"  42 U.S.C.   12111(10).\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\nallowed to present  expert testimony in  a timely fashion  in\r\n\norder to show an actual disability under the statute.  \r\n\n          Accordingly, we reverse and remand for a new trial,\r                                                        \r\n\nleaving it open to Katz to retry the case under any or all of\r\n\nthe three theories of disability available under the statute.\r\n\n          Costs on appeal awarded to appellant.\r\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n",

Katz was hired by City Metal on July 1, 1991.   On September 27, 1992, he suffered a heart attack.   Five weeks later, Wilcox telephoned Katz and told him his employment was terminated.   This lawsuit followed, and ended at the close of Katz's case in a judgment as a matter of law for City Metal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We review the grant of a Rule 50(a) motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo, under the same standards as the district court.\"  Andrade v.

Accordingly, we \"examine the evidence and all fair inferences in the light most favorable to the plaintiff [and] may not consider the credibility of witnesses, resolve conflicts in testimony, or evaluate the weight of the evidence.\"  Richmond Steel, Inc. v.

To affirm the withdrawal of any claim from the jury, we must find that, as a matter of law, the record would permit a reasonable jury to reach only one conclusion as to that issue.

City Metal hired him in July of 1991 as a scrap metal salesman because of his prior experience in the field.   He was assigned various territories which he serviced by traveling in a company car.   At the end of 1991, Bruno asked Katz to take an inside position in customer relations as a liaison between the company and its customers.   Katz accepted and continued in that position until July of 1992.   During that time Katz also helped to train Wilcox, who was new to the business, and trained other salesmen.   In July of 1992, Katz, at his request, returned to being a salesman.   Up until the time he was discharged, Katz did not receive any negative reports or comments about the quality of his performance and was not informed that his job was in jeopardy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Sunday, September 27, 1992, while Katz was in Cleveland visiting his family, he had a heart attack and was taken by ambulance to the Cleveland Clinic.   During his seven-day stay there, Katz underwent two angioplasty procedures and some testing, and was kept in cardiac intensive care.   He was discharged from the hospital on Saturday, October 3, 1992, and telephoned Wilcox on the following Monday to explain the situation.   Wilcox then sent Katz Rhode Island temporary disability application forms.   Katz submitted them and received disability payments for six months, the maximum payable under Rhode Island law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After his discharge from the hospital, Katz had great difficulty breathing, even while sitting down, and was extremely limited in his ability to walk.   After a few steps, he became short of breath and experienced chest pains, broke into sweats and became nauseous.   It was necessary that he keep stress to a minimum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Katz went to the company office on the Thursday afternoon following his hospital discharge for the purpose of discussing his return to work.   Due to the effects of his heart attack, Katz was unable to walk to the company's office on the second floor.   Wilcox therefore came down to Katz's car, where the two had a conversation.   Katz asked about his customers and told Wilcox he wanted to return to work as soon as possible, even if it was initially in a limited capacity.   Wilcox told him not to worry about his customers, and that the main thing was for Katz to get well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Katz stayed in Rhode Island for about a week after his conversation with Wilcox.   The cold weather, however, restricted his breathing which, in turn, made walking even more difficult.   Since Wilcox had told him that his first objective should be to get well, Katz decided to recuperate at his family's apartment in Miami, Florida.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Friday, the last working day of October, Wilcox telephoned Katz and told him that he was discharged.   Katz called Wilcox the following Monday and offered to return to work on a part-time basis with a reduction in salary and to accept whatever accommodations the company would make.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the trial in October of 1995, Katz still had some trouble breathing and walking.   He was working, having obtained a job on February 17, 1995 (after a lengthy search beginning in January of 1993), selling bonds for the State of Israel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Katz also called Wilcox as a witness.   He testified that Katz's brother called to tell him about the heart attack two days after it occurred, and that he never questioned that Katz had a heart attack.   He testified that Katz looked tired when he met him in the parking lot, and that he told Katz that his main objective should be to recover.   Wilcox testified, however, that he had decided to fire Katz on September 4, 1992 (prior to the heart attack), for failing to submit a weekly travel schedule as required, and that he had merely waited until the end of October to so inform Katz.  Katz also called Bruno as a witness, who testified that he was instrumental in hiring Katz, but was not familiar with the circumstances of his termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Judgment As A Matter Of Law</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Katz, Wilcox, and Bruno had testified, Katz's attorney informed the court that he had one more witness--Katz's treating physician in Rhode Island--whom he had subpoenaed for the following day.   The court recessed until the following day, when Katz's attorney informed the court that the doctor had declined to appear in court until Friday, three days hence, and requested that he be permitted to present the doctor's testimony in rebuttal after the defendants' case.   The court stated that it would deal with the issue when it arose and was not sure the doctor's testimony was \"vital to the essence of your claim.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When asked to state its position on the matter, City Metal stated that it had received Katz's medical records and that it did not dispute that Katz suffered a heart attack or that it perceived that he suffered a heart attack, but that it did contest that Katz was actually disabled within the meaning of the ADA.  At that point, the court stated that Katz could not prove that he was disabled without the testimony of his doctor, and Katz again requested either a continuance or that the doctor be permitted to testify in rebuttal.   The court denied those requests and Katz rested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">City Metal then moved for judgment as a matter of law, arguing that in order to prove a disability under the ADA and the Rhode Island Fair Employment Practices Act, Katz was required to show that the heart attack \"severely restricted a basic life activity on a permanent and continuing basis,\" and that he had failed to do so because there had been no medical testimony that Katz was permanently impaired in a major life activity.   In response, Katz argued that his testimony established that the heart attack resulted in hospitalization, and impaired his ability to breathe, walk, perform manual tasks, care for himself and work, and that the evidence therefore met each of the three alternative definitions of the term \"disability\" under the ADA--that he had a physical impairment that substantially limited one or more major life activities, that he had a record of such an impairment, and that City Metal regarded him as having such an impairment.   See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12102(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled as follows:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>The question is whether it produced a permanent disability that he can't perform his work.   It's obvious he's a salesman, and he's still selling....  In order for the Plaintiff to recover in this case, the Plaintiff must make a showing that he has some type of permanent impairment, physical impairment in one or more of life's major activities.   There's been no showing of that in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>The only evidence is that he has a blocked artery that was opened up by balloon angioplasty.   That does not show that he has a permanent disability or heart disease.   I know.   I've been there.   I had a heart attack.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>People recover from heart attacks and go on with life's functions.   I know, I've done it, and I had an artery that was completely blocked and not reopened.   Because I went through a rehab program where I developed the collateral arteries to take over the function of that artery, now I can perform.   I'm playing tennis.   I'm doing aerobic exercises every other day.   I can perform fully in my life's functions as a Judge, where there's a lot more stress than some other vocations.   So I have personal experience in this.   Now a judge can't put aside his personal experiences in life in deciding cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>I have decided it as a matter of law.   I have decided the Plaintiff failed to prove that he had a permanent disability resulting from his heart attack.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court erred in ruling that there was insufficient evidence of disability within the meaning of the ADA.  We start with the words of the statute.   The Americans with Disabilities Act is a federal civil rights statute, enacted \"to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101(b)(1).   See also Grenier v. Cyanamid Plastics, Inc., 70 F.3d 667, 671 (1st Cir.1995).   In the employment context, the ADA prohibits a \"covered entity\" (defined as \"a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has 15 or more employees\") from \"discriminat[ing] against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 12112(a).

Examples of impairments that are \"usually not disabilities\" because they are \"temporary,\" \"non-chronic,\" and \"of short duration, with little or no long term or permanent impact,\" are \"broken limbs, sprained joints, concussions, appendicitis, and influenza.\"   29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630, App. at 402.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Especially given that City Metal has never disputed that Katz had a heart attack, we have no doubt that a rational jury could conclude, even without expert medical testimony, that Katz had a condition affecting the cardiovascular system and therefore that he had a physical impairment under the ADA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(h)(1).   We think, however, that it is a very close question whether Katz offered sufficient evidence to prove that that impairment \"substantially limited\" his major life activities within the meaning of the ADA, his scheduled expert medical witness having proved unavailable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As might reasonably be expected after any major trauma and resultant medical procedure or surgery, Katz's ability to breathe, walk and work was substantially limited in the period immediately following the heart attack and angioplasty procedures.   This does not, however, necessarily lead to the conclusion that Katz had a disability.   See McDonald v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 62 F.3d 92, 96 (3d Cir.1995) (inability to work for two months following surgery not a disability).   We think that it would be difficult for a lay jury to conclude, based solely on the immediate effects of a heart attack and angioplasty procedure on Katz, that those limitations were permanent or persisted on a long-term basis, or that their duration was indefinite and unknowable or expected to be at least several months.   Katz was apparently prepared to present medical testimony to this effect but, as already noted, his medical expert was unavailable and the court declined to delay the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is certainly no general rule that medical testimony is always necessary to establish disability.   Some long-term impairments would be obvious to a lay jury (e.g., a missing arm) and it is certainly within the realm of possibility that a plaintiff himself in a disabilities case might offer a description of treatments and symptoms over a substantial period that would put the jury in a position where it could determine that he did suffer from a disability within the meaning of the ADA.  On this record, we think it is a much closer case whether Katz put such evidence before the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bulk of the evidence as to Katz's medical condition related primarily to his situation immediately after the operation, including his initial effort to return to work in which he was so stricken that he could not even leave the car and climb up a flight of stairs to the office.   Katz did testify that even three years after the operation, he still felt in poor condition;  but that testimony was far more general and far less specific than his testimony regarding the impact of the heart attack in the month or so immediately following its occurrence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it was unwise for the district court to invoke its own medical experience in explaining its determination that Katz's evidence was inadequate, since the determination of whether an impairment substantially limits a major activity must be made on an individual basis:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>The determination of whether an individual has a disability is ... based ... on the effect of that impairment on the life of the individual.   Some impairments may be disabling for particular individuals but not for others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630, App. at 402.   See also Chandler v. City of Dallas, 2 F.3d 1385, 1396 (5th Cir.1993) (recognizing that \"the effect of a given type of impairment ... can vary widely from individual to individual\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 1386, 128 L.Ed.2d 61 (1994).   Nonetheless, it is at least a debatable question whether, based on Katz's testimony, the jury could conclude that he suffered from a continuing medical condition, persisting beyond the period immediately after the operation, that substantially limited one or more of his major life activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not definitively resolve the issue of whether expert medical testimony was necessary for the case to go forward on a theory of actual disability in this case, because we think that the evidence permitted Katz to reach the jury under one of the alternative definitions of disability, that City Metal \"regarded [Katz] as having such an impairment.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 12102(2)(C).   Under the regulations an individual who has an impairment that is not substantially limiting (or has no impairment at all) is nevertheless \"disabled\" if he is treated by the employer as having an impairment that does substantially limit major life activities.  29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(l )(1).   An example given is an employee whose controlled high blood pressure is not a disability but is reassigned because the employer fears, wrongly, that the employee may have a heart attack.   Id. Pt. 1630, App.  See also Cook, 10 F.3d at 20-21, 23, 25 (employer treated employee as handicapped by refusing to rehire her based on its belief that her morbid obesity would compromise her ability to do her job and put her at risk of developing serious ailments).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Katz alleged in his complaint that he was not only actually disabled but also perceived by his employer to be disabled, and was fired because of it.   The dramatic encounter at the office, in which Katz was unable to climb the stairs and Wilcox observed his fatigue, is only one piece of evidence;  others included the employer's knowledge of the heart attack, angioplasty procedure and hospitalization, and yet another was Katz's own statements to his employer that when he returned to work it would at least initially have to be in a limited capacity.   Cf. Hamm v. Runyon, 51 F.3d 721, 724-26 (7th Cir.1995) (employer did not \"regard\" employee as disabled where there was no evidence that the person who made the decision to fire him was even told about the employee's arthritis;  employee told his direct supervisor that it was \"nothing\" and \"would pass\" and continued to do all of the functions of his job).   Even if medical expert testimony were required here to permit the jury to find that Katz was suffering from a continuing serious heart condition, the jury certainly did not need medical testimony in making its own judgment as to what the employer may have perceived, rightly or wrongly, about Katz's condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the district court proposed to withdraw the case from the jury and direct a verdict, Katz argued to the court that regardless of actual medical condition, he had provided a basis for the jury to conclude that the employer perceived him to be disabled.   The judge did not directly respond to this assertion.   Katz has renewed it on appeal, but City Metal's brief also fails to respond in any depth to the perception argument.   At least on this record, we have to conclude that Katz did provide enough evidence to reach the jury on the issue of perception which, as already noted, does constitute disability within the meaning of the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress, when it provided for perception to be the basis of disability status, probably had principally in mind the more usual case in which a plaintiff has a long-term medical condition of some kind, and the employer exaggerates its significance by failing to make a reasonable accommodation.   But both the language and policy of the statute seem to us to offer protection as well to one who is not substantially disabled or even disabled at all but is wrongly perceived to be so.   And, of course, it may well be that Katz was both actually disabled and perceived to be so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second element of proof is ability to perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodation.   See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12111(8).   Katz testified that five days after his discharge from the hospital and again two days after he was fired, he asked Wilcox to accommodate him by allowing him to return to work on a part-time basis.   On the latter occasion, Katz suggested a reduction in salary and said he would accept whatever accommodations the company would make in order to keep his job.   Reasonable accommodations include, inter alia, \"job restructuring [and] part-time or modified work schedules.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 12111(9).   As we noted in Grenier v. Cyanamid Plastics, Inc.:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p>With respect to known disabilities, however, the emphasis is on encouraging the employer to \"engage in an interactive process with the individual to determine an effective reasonable accommodation.\"   Guidance &#167; IV.B.6b (citing H.R.Rep. No. 485 (Pt. 2), supra, at 65-66, U.S.C.C.A.N. at 347-48).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">70 F.3d at 677.   Katz's suggestions were rejected out of hand.   The district judge did not say that Katz had failed to show that he could perform his job with reasonable accommodations, nor does City Metal offer any argument as to this element on appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third element of plaintiff's case, that Katz was fired because of a disability, or that his disability was a motivating factor in City Metal's decision to fire him, Pedigo v. P.A.M. Transport, Inc., 60 F.3d 1300, 1301 (8th Cir.1995), also was a question of fact for the jury.   The timing of Katz's firing, one month after his heart attack, was circumstantial evidence from which the jury could find that Katz's disability triggered, in whole or in part, his firing by City Metal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We rule that the court erred in granting judgment as a matter of law for City Metal, because the evidence would permit the conclusion that Katz established that City Metal regarded him as having an impairment constituting a disability under section 12102(2)(C) of the Act.  Thus, he proved a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA and the Rhode Island Fair Employment Practices Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where there must be a remand for a new trial, we have broad authority to draft a remand order that is fair and just.  28 U.S.C. &#167; 2106.   In this instance, given that Katz was deprived of his medical testimony more or less by accident, we see no reason why on retrial he should not be allowed to present expert testimony in a timely fashion in order to show an actual disability under the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we reverse and remand for a new trial, leaving it open to Katz to retry the case under any or all of the three theories of disability available under the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Costs on appeal awarded to appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Because the definition of \"handicap\" under the Rhode Island law is substantially identical to the ADA's definition of \"disability,\" we will not separately address the state law claim.

City Metal hired him in July of 1991 as a scrap metal salesman because of his prior experience in the field.   He was assigned various territories which he serviced by traveling in a company car.   At the end of 1991, Bruno asked Katz to take an inside position in customer relations as a liaison between the company and its customers.   Katz accepted and continued in that position until July of 1992.   During that time Katz also helped to train Wilcox, who was new to the business, and trained other salesmen.   In July of 1992, Katz, at his request, returned to being a salesman.   Up until the time he was discharged, Katz did not receive any negative reports or comments about the quality of his performance and was not informed that his job was in jeopardy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Sunday, September 27, 1992, while Katz was in Cleveland visiting his family, he had a heart attack and was taken by ambulance to the Cleveland Clinic.   During his seven-day stay there, Katz underwent two angioplasty procedures and some testing, and was kept in cardiac intensive care.   He was discharged from the hospital on Saturday, October 3, 1992, and telephoned Wilcox on the following Monday to explain the situation.   Wilcox then sent Katz Rhode Island temporary disability application forms.   Katz submitted them and received disability payments for six months, the maximum payable under Rhode Island law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After his discharge from the hospital, Katz had great difficulty breathing, even while sitting down, and was extremely limited in his ability to walk.   After a few steps, he became short of breath and experienced chest pains, broke into sweats and became nauseous.   It was necessary that he keep stress to a minimum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Katz went to the company office on the Thursday afternoon following his hospital discharge for the purpose of discussing his return to work.   Due to the effects of his heart attack, Katz was unable to walk to the company's office on the second floor.   Wilcox therefore came down to Katz's car, where the two had a conversation.   Katz asked about his customers and told Wilcox he wanted to return to work as soon as possible, even if it was initially in a limited capacity.   Wilcox told him not to worry about his customers, and that the main thing was for Katz to get well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Katz stayed in Rhode Island for about a week after his conversation with Wilcox.   The cold weather, however, restricted his breathing which, in turn, made walking even more difficult.   Since Wilcox had told him that his first objective should be to get well, Katz decided to recuperate at his family's apartment in Miami, Florida.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Friday, the last working day of October, Wilcox telephoned Katz and told him that he was discharged.   Katz called Wilcox the following Monday and offered to return to work on a part-time basis with a reduction in salary and to accept whatever accommodations the company would make.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the trial in October of 1995, Katz still had some trouble breathing and walking.   He was working, having obtained a job on February 17, 1995 (after a lengthy search beginning in January of 1993), selling bonds for the State of Israel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Katz also called Wilcox as a witness.   He testified that Katz's brother called to tell him about the heart attack two days after it occurred, and that he never questioned that Katz had a heart attack.   He testified that Katz looked tired when he met him in the parking lot, and that he told Katz that his main objective should be to recover.   Wilcox testified, however, that he had decided to fire Katz on September 4, 1992 (prior to the heart attack), for failing to submit a weekly travel schedule as required, and that he had merely waited until the end of October to so inform Katz.  Katz also called Bruno as a witness, who testified that he was instrumental in hiring Katz, but was not familiar with the circumstances of his termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Judgment As A Matter Of Law</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Katz, Wilcox, and Bruno had testified, Katz's attorney informed the court that he had one more witness--Katz's treating physician in Rhode Island--whom he had subpoenaed for the following day.   The court recessed until the following day, when Katz's attorney informed the court that the doctor had declined to appear in court until Friday, three days hence, and requested that he be permitted to present the doctor's testimony in rebuttal after the defendants' case.   The court stated that it would deal with the issue when it arose and was not sure the doctor's testimony was \"vital to the essence of your claim.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When asked to state its position on the matter, City Metal stated that it had received Katz's medical records and that it did not dispute that Katz suffered a heart attack or that it perceived that he suffered a heart attack, but that it did contest that Katz was actually disabled within the meaning of the ADA.  At that point, the court stated that Katz could not prove that he was disabled without the testimony of his doctor, and Katz again requested either a continuance or that the doctor be permitted to testify in rebuttal.   The court denied those requests and Katz rested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">City Metal then moved for judgment as a matter of law, arguing that in order to prove a disability under the ADA and the Rhode Island Fair Employment Practices Act, Katz was required to show that the heart attack \"severely restricted a basic life activity on a permanent and continuing basis,\" and that he had failed to do so because there had been no medical testimony that Katz was permanently impaired in a major life activity.   In response, Katz argued that his testimony established that the heart attack resulted in hospitalization, and impaired his ability to breathe, walk, perform manual tasks, care for himself and work, and that the evidence therefore met each of the three alternative definitions of the term \"disability\" under the ADA--that he had a physical impairment that substantially limited one or more major life activities, that he had a record of such an impairment, and that City Metal regarded him as having such an impairment.   See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12102(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled as follows:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>The question is whether it produced a permanent disability that he can't perform his work.   It's obvious he's a salesman, and he's still selling....  In order for the Plaintiff to recover in this case, the Plaintiff must make a showing that he has some type of permanent impairment, physical impairment in one or more of life's major activities.   There's been no showing of that in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>The only evidence is that he has a blocked artery that was opened up by balloon angioplasty.   That does not show that he has a permanent disability or heart disease.   I know.   I've been there.

I know, I've done it, and I had an artery that was completely blocked and not reopened.   Because I went through a rehab program where I developed the collateral arteries to take over the function of that artery, now I can perform.   I'm playing tennis.   I'm doing aerobic exercises every other day.   I can perform fully in my life's functions as a Judge, where there's a lot more stress than some other vocations.   So I have personal experience in this.   Now a judge can't put aside his personal experiences in life in deciding cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>I have decided it as a matter of law.   I have decided the Plaintiff failed to prove that he had a permanent disability resulting from his heart attack.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court erred in ruling that there was insufficient evidence of disability within the meaning of the ADA.  We start with the words of the statute.   The Americans with Disabilities Act is a federal civil rights statute, enacted \"to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101(b)(1).   See also Grenier v. Cyanamid Plastics, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"708160\"><a href=\"/opinion/708160/andre-grenier-v-cyanamid-plastics-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">667</span></a></span>, 671 (1st Cir.1995).   In the employment context, the ADA prohibits a \"covered entity\" (defined as \"a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has 15 or more employees\") from \"discriminat[ing] against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 12112(a).   To obtain relief under the Act, a plaintiff must prove three things.   First, that he was disabled within the meaning of the Act.  Second, that with or without reasonable accommodation he was able to perform the essential functions of his job.   And third, that the employer discharged him in whole or in part because of his disability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the district court's ruling, we focus on the first element--\"disability\"--as defined in the ADA:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>The term \"disability\" means, with respect to an individual----</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>(B) a record of such an impairment;  or(C) being regarded as having such an impairment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">42 U.S.C. &#167; 12102(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A \"physical impairment\" is \"[a]ny physiological disorder, or condition ... or anatomical loss affecting,\" inter alia, the \"cardiovascular\" system.  29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(h)(1) (1995).  \"Major life activities\" are defined as \"functions such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working.\"  29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(i).  \"Substantially limited\" is defined as:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) Unable to perform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform;  or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) Significantly restricted as to the condition, manner or duration under which an individual can perform a particular major life activity as compared to the condition, manner or duration under which the average person in the general population can perform that same major life activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(j)(1).

Examples of impairments that are \"usually not disabilities\" because they are \"temporary,\" \"non-chronic,\" and \"of short duration, with little or no long term or permanent impact,\" are \"broken limbs, sprained joints, concussions, appendicitis, and influenza.\"   29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630, App. at 402.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Especially given that City Metal has never disputed that Katz had a heart attack, we have no doubt that a rational jury could conclude, even without expert medical testimony, that Katz had a condition affecting the cardiovascular system and therefore that he had a physical impairment under the ADA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(h)(1).   We think, however, that it is a very close question whether Katz offered sufficient evidence to prove that that impairment \"substantially limited\" his major life activities within the meaning of the ADA, his scheduled expert medical witness having proved unavailable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As might reasonably be expected after any major trauma and resultant medical procedure or surgery, Katz's ability to breathe, walk and work was substantially limited in the period immediately following the heart attack and angioplasty procedures.   This does not, however, necessarily lead to the conclusion that Katz had a disability.   See McDonald v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"701318\"><a href=\"/opinion/701318/bonita-mcdonald-v-commonwealth-of-pennsylvania-department-of-public/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></a></span>, 96 (3d Cir.1995) (inability to work for two months following surgery not a disability).   We think that it would be difficult for a lay jury to conclude, based solely on the immediate effects of a heart attack and angioplasty procedure on Katz, that those limitations were permanent or persisted on a long-term basis, or that their duration was indefinite and unknowable or expected to be at least several months.   Katz was apparently prepared to present medical testimony to this effect but, as already noted, his medical expert was unavailable and the court declined to delay the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is certainly no general rule that medical testimony is always necessary to establish disability.   Some long-term impairments would be obvious to a lay jury (e.g., a missing arm) and it is certainly within the realm of possibility that a plaintiff himself in a disabilities case might offer a description of treatments and symptoms over a substantial period that would put the jury in a position where it could determine that he did suffer from a disability within the meaning of the ADA.  On this record, we think it is a much closer case whether Katz put such evidence before the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bulk of the evidence as to Katz's medical condition related primarily to his situation immediately after the operation, including his initial effort to return to work in which he was so stricken that he could not even leave the car and climb up a flight of stairs to the office.   Katz did testify that even three years after the operation, he still felt in poor condition;  but that testimony was far more general and far less specific than his testimony regarding the impact of the heart attack in the month or so immediately following its occurrence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it was unwise for the district court to invoke its own medical experience in explaining its determination that Katz's evidence was inadequate, since the determination of whether an impairment substantially limits a major activity must be made on an individual basis:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>The determination of whether an individual has a disability is ... based ... on the effect of that impairment on the life of the individual.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></span> (1994).   Nonetheless, it is at least a debatable question whether, based on Katz's testimony, the jury could conclude that he suffered from a continuing medical condition, persisting beyond the period immediately after the operation, that substantially limited one or more of his major life activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not definitively resolve the issue of whether expert medical testimony was necessary for the case to go forward on a theory of actual disability in this case, because we think that the evidence permitted Katz to reach the jury under one of the alternative definitions of disability, that City Metal \"regarded [Katz] as having such an impairment.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 12102(2)(C).   Under the regulations an individual who has an impairment that is not substantially limiting (or has no impairment at all) is nevertheless \"disabled\" if he is treated by the employer as having an impairment that does substantially limit major life activities.  29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(l )(1).   An example given is an employee whose controlled high blood pressure is not a disability but is reassigned because the employer fears, wrongly, that the employee may have a heart attack.   Id. Pt. 1630, App.  See also Cook, 10 F.3d at 20-21, 23, 25 (employer treated employee as handicapped by refusing to rehire her based on its belief that her morbid obesity would compromise her ability to do her job and put her at risk of developing serious ailments).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Katz alleged in his complaint that he was not only actually disabled but also perceived by his employer to be disabled, and was fired because of it.   The dramatic encounter at the office, in which Katz was unable to climb the stairs and Wilcox observed his fatigue, is only one piece of evidence;  others included the employer's knowledge of the heart attack, angioplasty procedure and hospitalization, and yet another was Katz's own statements to his employer that when he returned to work it would at least initially have to be in a limited capacity.   Cf. Hamm v. Runyon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"693004\"><a href=\"/opinion/693004/walter-b-hamm-v-marvin-runyon-postmaster-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">721</span></a></span>, 724-26 (7th Cir.1995) (employer did not \"regard\" employee as disabled where there was no evidence that the person who made the decision to fire him was even told about the employee's arthritis;  employee told his direct supervisor that it was \"nothing\" and \"would pass\" and continued to do all of the functions of his job).   Even if medical expert testimony were required here to permit the jury to find that Katz was suffering from a continuing serious heart condition, the jury certainly did not need medical testimony in making its own judgment as to what the employer may have perceived, rightly or wrongly, about Katz's condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the district court proposed to withdraw the case from the jury and direct a verdict, Katz argued to the court that regardless of actual medical condition, he had provided a basis for the jury to conclude that the employer perceived him to be disabled.   The judge did not directly respond to this assertion.   Katz has renewed it on appeal, but City Metal's brief also fails to respond in any depth to the perception argument.   At least on this record, we have to conclude that Katz did provide enough evidence to reach the jury on the issue of perception which, as already noted, does constitute disability within the meaning of the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress, when it provided for perception to be the basis of disability status, probably had principally in mind the more usual case in which a plaintiff has a long-term medical condition of some kind, and the employer exaggerates its significance by failing to make a reasonable accommodation.   But both the language and policy of the statute seem to us to offer protection as well to one who is not substantially disabled or even disabled at all but is wrongly perceived to be so.   And, of course, it may well be that Katz was both actually disabled and perceived to be so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second element of proof is ability to perform the essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodation.   See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12111(8).   Katz testified that five days after his discharge from the hospital and again two days after he was fired, he asked Wilcox to accommodate him by allowing him to return to work on a part-time basis.   On the latter occasion, Katz suggested a reduction in salary and said he would accept whatever accommodations the company would make in order to keep his job.   Reasonable accommodations include, inter alia, \"job restructuring [and] part-time or modified work schedules.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 12111(9).   As we noted in Grenier v. Cyanamid Plastics, Inc.:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p>With respect to known disabilities, however, the emphasis is on encouraging the employer to \"engage in an interactive process with the individual to determine an effective reasonable accommodation.\"   Guidance &#167; IV.B.6b (citing H.R.Rep.

Katz's suggestions were rejected out of hand.   The district judge did not say that Katz had failed to show that he could perform his job with reasonable accommodations, nor does City Metal offer any argument as to this element on appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third element of plaintiff's case, that Katz was fired because of a disability, or that his disability was a motivating factor in City Metal's decision to fire him, Pedigo v.
