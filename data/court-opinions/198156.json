HIGGINS,\r\n\n                  Plaintiff, Appellant,\r\n\n                            v.\r\n\n                  STATE OF RHODE ISLAND,\r\n\n                   Defendant, Appellee.\r\n\n       APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n             FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND\r\n\n         [Hon. Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                  Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n            Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n Patrick J. Higgins on brief pro se.\r\n\nOctober 8, 1998\r\n\n        Per Curiam.  Patrick J. Higgins has appealed the\r\ndistrict court's sua sponte dismissal of his complaint for lack\r\nof subject matter jurisdiction.  We agree with the district\r\ncourt that 28 U.S.C.  2254 was wholly inapplicable as a basis\r\nfor jurisdiction.  Section 2254 pertains to a prisoner in\r\ncustody pursuant to a judgment of conviction of a state court\r\nand Higgins has not yet been convicted of the pending Rhode\r\nIsland charges.  See 28 U.S.C.  2254 (\"[T]he district court\r\nshall entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus in\r\nbehalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a\r\nState court only on the ground that he is in custody in\r\nviolation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United\r\nStates.\").  (Emphasis added).\r\n          We disagree with the district court, however, to the\r\nextent that it concluded that Higgins' complaint was not\r\nproperly construed as an application for a writ of habeas\r\ncorpus.  A prisoner may properly bring a pretrial habeas\r\npetition under 28 U.S.C.  2241, which empowers a district\r\ncourt to issue a habeas writ before a judgment is rendered in\r\na criminal proceeding.  Furthermore, if Rhode Island lodged a\r\ndetainer against Higgins (as he appears to have alleged),\r\nHiggins is \"in custody\" for habeas purposes pursuant to that\r\nRhode Island detainer.  See Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit\r\nCourt of Kentucky, 410 U.S. 484, 488-89 (1973) (holding that a\r\nprisoner incarcerated in Alabama and serving an Alabama\r\nstatsentence and who was under indictment in Kentucky was \"in\r\n                              2\r\ncustody\" pursuant to a Kentucky detainer and may file a habeas\r\naction seeking to enforce Kentucky's obligation to bring him\r\npromptly to trial).\r\n          Nonetheless, \"[w]e will affirm a correct result\r\nreached by the court below on any independently sufficient\r\nground made manifest by the record.\"  Hodgens v. General\r\nDynamics Corp., 144 F.3d 151, 173 (1st Cir. 1998) (internal\r\nquotation marks and citation omitted).  A  2241 habeas\r\npetition must exhaust his available state court remedies.  SeeBraden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Kentucky, 410 U.S. at\r\n489-92.  Higgins contends that he filed a petition for a writ\r\nof mandamus in the Rhode Island Supreme Court invoking his\r\nright to a speedy trial.  He did not provide a copy of the\r\nsubstance of that petition with his federal court filing. \r\nAssuming that this is the only demand for speedy trial Higgins\r\nmade in the state court (and he does not indicate otherwise),\r\nit is doubtful that this submission satisfies Higgins'\r\nobligation to exhaust all available state remedies as a prelude\r\nto his federal habeas action.  The applicable Rhode Island\r\nrules suggest that a speedy trial demand ought to be presented\r\nin the first instance in the state trial court.  See Sup. Ct.\r\nRules, Art. I, Rule 13(a) (reciting that a petition for an\r\nextraordinary writ shall include, inter alia, \"a statement\r\nsetting forth with particularity why the relief sought is not\r\navailable in any other court, or cannot be had through other\r\nappellate processes\").  Moreover, although Higgins did provide\r\na copy of the state Supreme Court's order denying his mandamus\r\npetition, it was a summary denial, and the applicable rules\r\nalso provide, in relevant part, that \"[a] denial of a petition,\r\nwithout more, is not an adjudication on the merits, and such\r\naction is to be taken as being without prejudice to a further\r\napplication to this court or any court for the relief sought.\" \r\nSup. Ct. Rules, Art. I, Rule 13(c).  It is Higgins' burden to\r\nestablish that he has exhausted all available state remedies\r\nand, to the extent that the record is unclear on this point,\r\nthat failing befalls Higgins.  See Nadworny v. Fair, 872 F.2d\r\n1093, 1098 (1st Cir. 1989).\r\n          Two additional considerations inform our\r\ndetermination that affirmance is fair and appropriate.  One,\r\nthe Rhode Island Supreme Court's order denying mandamus related\r\nthat Higgins is represented by counsel \"in Superior Court\r\nproceedings related to the instant mandamus petition.\"  If\r\nHiggins' allegation that his right to speedy trial is being\r\nviolated has any merit, it is reasonable to assume that his\r\ncurrent counsel can effectively address that issue in the state\r\ncourts.  Second, Higgins has recently notified this court of a\r\nchange of address.  He provided a current address of a post\r\noffice box in Swansea, Massachusetts, as well as a\r\nMassachusetts telephone number.  It appears therefore that, to\r\nthe extent that Higgins' complaint was based on Mississippi's\r\ndenial of parole due to the pending Rhode Island charges, that\r\nparticular concern no longer pertains.\r\n          For the foregoing reasons, the order of the district\r\ncourt dismissing the complaint is affirmed.\n",
