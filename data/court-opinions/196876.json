Velez claims that the  district court\r\n\nerroneously  ruled that the  government did  not breach  the plea\r\n\nagreement  by  failing  to  recommend a  downward  departure  for\r\n\n\"substantial assistance.\"   See 18 U.S.C.    3553(e); U.S.S.G.   \r                                         \r\n\n5K1.1.  We affirm.\r\n\n          Under his  plea agreement,  Velez promised  to continue\r\n\ntruthfully  to  disclose to  the government  accurate information\r\n\nrelated  to  all   unlawful  activities  in  which   he  and  his\r\n\ncollaborators were  involved, and to  refrain from  \"commit[ting]\r\n\nany offense.\"   The government  in turn promised  to recommend  a\r\n\ndownward departure  for \"substantial  assistance\" pursuant to  18\r\n\nU.S.C.   3553 and U.S.S.G.   5K1.1.  \r\n\n          Several months after entering  into the plea agreement,\r\n\nVelez was arrested on a new charge, as a felon in possession of a\r\n\nloaded  firearm,  see 18  U.S.C.    922(g)(1),  to which  he pled\r                               \r\n\nguilty.   Thereafter, Velez  provided further information  to the\r\n\ngovernment about the earlier cocaine conspiracy, which he had not\r\n\ndisclosed  as required by the plea agreement.  At sentencing, the\r\n\ngovernment  declined  to  move  for  a  \"substantial  assistance\"\r\n\ndeparture,   citing   Velez'   deliberate   withholding   of  the\r\n\ninformation  relating  to  the  cocaine   conspiracy,  in  direct\r\n\nviolation of the  plea agreement.   The  district court  rejected\r\n\nVelez'  claim  that he  had  forgotten  the omitted  information.\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nAdditionally,   the   district  court   determined   that  Velez'\r\n\ncommission of a subsequent offense violated the plea agreement as\r\n\nwell.  Accordingly, the court ruled that the government had acted\r\n\nin  good faith and that Velez' conduct relieved the government of\r\n\nany obligation to recommend a   5K1.1 downward departure. \r\n\n          We need not discuss the Velez challenge to the district\r\n\ncourt's  ruling insofar as it depended on the failure to disclose\r\n\nall information relating to his unlawful activities involving his\r\n\ncollaborators, since Velez' failure to refrain from \"commit[ting]\r\n\nany offense\" inarguably constituted a material breach of the plea\r\n\nagreement  sufficient  to  warrant  the  government's refusal  to\r\n\nrecommend a downward departure for substantial assistance. \r\n\n     Affirmed.\r               Affirmed.\r                        \r\n\n                                3\r\r\n",
