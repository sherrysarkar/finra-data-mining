A grand jury indicted Donald\n\nCook for possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute. See 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(a)(1). Cook subsequently moved to suppress the cocaine,\n\narguing that the police seized it in violation of his Fourth Amendment\n\nrights. The district court denied the motion because it determined\n\nthat the cocaine was lawfully seized following an investigative stop\n\nauthorized by Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968). Ultimately, Cook was\n\nconvicted of the lesser-included offense of possession of more than\n\nfive grams of crack cocaine. See 21 U.S.C. § 844. He appeals his\n\nconviction, arguing that the court erred in denying his suppression\n\nmotion.   We affirm.\n\n                                 I.\n\n          We construe the record in the light most favorable to the\n\ndistrict court’s ruling, drawing reasonable inferences in the\n\ngovernment’s favor. See United States v. McCarthy, 77 F.3d 522, 525\n\n(1st Cir. 1996); see also United States v. Payton, 615 F.2d 922, 923\n\n(1st Cir. 1980). The following recitation is derived from testimony\n\ngiven at the suppression hearing, as well as from affidavits submitted\n\nby two of the three arresting officers.\n\n                                 -2-\n\f          In the early morning hours of July 31, 1999, Boston Police\n\nOfficers Craig Jones, Mark Freire, and John Conroy were patrolling the\n\nRiver Street area of Mattapan in an unmarked Crown Victoria sedan.\n\nJones was driving. The officers were members of the Boston Police\n\nDepartment’s Youth Violence Strike Force and were in plain clothes.\n\nFreire and Jones, who had 28 years of experience between them, were\n\nfamiliar with their locale and understood it to be a high-crime area in\n\nwhich the trafficking of cocaine and other drugs was common.\n\n          At approximately 1:30 a.m., the officers approached the Rolls\n\nClub, a Mattapan bar.   All of the officers knew that members of a\n\nstreet gang, known as KOZ, frequented the Rolls Club. Jones knew that\n\nKOZ was heavily involved in drug trafficking and firearms offenses.\n\nJones also understood that Cook, whom he had known for years, was a\n\nmember of KOZ and had a criminal history that included convictions for\n\ndrug trafficking, crimes of violence, and at least one firearms\n\noffense. Freire did not know Cook. Nor was he familiar with Cook’s\n\ncriminal history.\n\n          As the officers approached the club in their unmarked\n\nvehicle, Freire observed Cook and a second man facing each other with\n\ntheir hands extended as if they were about to exchange something.\n\nBefore any exchange took place, the men looked at the approaching\n\npolice vehicle and, apparently recognizing it as such, pulled their\n\nhands back and separated. Cook then entered the passenger side of a\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fnearby Ford Explorer, which was illegally parked with all four wheels\n\non the sidewalk, and slid across behind the steering wheel. Jones\n\nfirst noticed Cook when he was inside the Explorer. After recognizing\n\nCook, Jones stopped his vehicle and made eye contact with Cook, who\n\nlooked alarmed. Both Freire and Jones thereafter saw Cook rise up out\n\nof his seat as if to place something in his pants or in the seat behind\n\nhim. Jones identified Cook to his fellow officers and advised them\n\nthat he thought Cook might have a gun. Freire, who had observed Cook’s\n\ninteraction with the unidentified man on the street, also was concerned\n\nthat Cook had risen up out of his seat to hide drugs.\n\n          All three officers exited the police vehicle and approached\n\nthe Explorer. Jones advanced toward the driver’s side with his weapon\n\ndrawn and asked Cook, through the open window, whether he had a gun.\n\nCook replied that he did not. Jones then leaned in the driver’s side\n\nwindow and, to the extent that he was able, patted Cook down. He then\n\nescorted Cook to the back of the Explorer and left him with Freire\n\nwhile he searched the vehicle for weapons. Freire, having noticed that\n\nJones had not been able to conduct a complete pat-down of Cook, began\n\npatting him down. As he was doing so, he asked Cook whether he was\n\nconcealing anything of which the officers should be aware.        Cook\n\nresponded that he had some marijuana.\n\n          Jones completed his search of the Explorer within a minute\n\nand returned to the back of the vehicle while Freire was completing the\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fpat-down. Jones asked Cook if he had placed something in his pants,\n\nand Cook replied that he had “a little bit of weed” on him. Jones was\n\nskeptical and told Cook so, commenting that he wasn’t going to lock him\n\nup for “a little bit of weed.” At that point, Cook admitted that he\n\nhad “few hits of crack.” Freire thereafter patted Cook down in the\n\narea of his buttocks and confirmed the presence of a hard object. The\n\nofficers subsequently placed Cook under arrest and, after a brief\n\nscuffle, subdued him and transported him to a nearby police station.\n\nThere, after being informed that the officers had the right to remove\n\nthe object from his buttocks, Cook produced a bag containing\n\napproximately 16 grams of crack cocaine from the back of his shorts.\n\n                                 II.\n\n          The law governing investigative stops is well understood.\n\nA law enforcement officer ordinarily may not stop someone and restrain\n\nhis freedom to walk away unless the officer has a “reasonable and\n\narticulable suspicion of criminal activity.” United States v. Chhien,\n\n266 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2001). The reasonable suspicion test has been\n\ndescribed as an intermediate standard requiring more than unfounded\n\nspeculation but less than probable cause. See id. At a minimum, the\n\nofficer must have a “particularized and objective basis” for suspicion.\n\nOrnelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690, 696 (1996) (quoting United\n\nStates v. Cortez, 449 U.S. 411, 417-18 (1981)). When determining the\n\nlegitimacy of an investigative stop, a court must undertake a\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fcontextual analysis using common sense and a degree of deference to the\n\nexpertise that informs a law enforcement officer’s judgments about\n\nsuspicious behavior.     See Chhien, 266 F.3d at 6.\n\n          An investigative stop also must “be reasonably related in\n\nscope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the\n\nfirst place.” Terry, 392 U.S. at 20. If a law enforcement officer\n\nreasonably suspects criminal activity, he may briefly question the\n\nsuspect about his concerns. See Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U.S. 420, 439\n\n(1984); United States v. Jones, 187 F.3d 210, 218 (1st Cir. 1999). If\n\nhe has a reasonable basis to suspect that the subject of his inquiry\n\nmay be armed, he also may frisk the suspect and undertake a limited\n\nsearch of the passenger compartment of any vehicle in which he is\n\nsitting. See United States v. Scott, 270 F.3d 30, 41 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nOnce again, context is vital in determining the permissible scope of an\n\ninvestigative stop.\n\n          Cook invokes these principles in challenging the district\n\ncourt’s suppression ruling. He first argues that the district court\n\nshould have suppressed the cocaine because the officers lacked a\n\nsufficient basis to reasonably suspect that he was illegally carrying\n\na firearm. Alternatively, he contends that, even if the initial stop\n\nwas justified, the officers should have released him immediately after\n\nthey determined that he was not armed. Both arguments depend upon the\n\nunarticulated assumption that the legitimacy of the stop must be\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fdetermined solely from Jones’s perspective, without regard to\n\nobservations made by other officers who jointly participated in the\n\nstop. Cook apparently reasons that because Jones (who first approached\n\nhim) did not personally witness any behavior which suggested that Cook\n\nhad recently participated in an attempted drug deal, the only possible\n\njustification for the stop was Jones’s suspicion that Cook was\n\nillegally carrying a firearm.      This assumption is incorrect.\n\n          As the Supreme Court has repeatedly noted, common sense and\n\npractical considerations must guide judgments about the reasonableness\n\nof searches and seizures. See United States v. Sharpe, 470 U.S. 675,\n\n685 (1985) (investigative stops); Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238\n\n(1983) (probable cause determinations); Texas v. Brown, 460 U.S. 730,\n\n735-36 (1983) (other exceptions to warrant requirement) (plurality\n\nopinion). Here, common sense suggests that, where law enforcement\n\nofficers are jointly involved in executing an investigative stop, the\n\nknowledge of each officer should be imputed to others jointly involved\n\nin executing the stop. See United States v. Ledford, 218 F.3d 684, 689\n\n(7th Cir. 2000) (applying principle in similar joint-search situation);\n\nsee also United States v. Meade, 110 F.3d 190, 193-94 (1st Cir. 1997)\n\n(discussing “Fellow-Officer/Collective-Knowledge” Rule).\n\n          Investigative stops generally occur in a dynamic environment\n\nmarked by the potential for violence. Officers who jointly make such\n\nstops rarely will have an opportunity to confer during the course of\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fthe stop. Basing the legitimacy of the stop solely on what the officer\n\nwho first approaches the suspect knows, rather than on the collective\n\nknowledge of all of the officers who participate directly in carrying\n\nout the stop, thus makes little sense from a practical standpoint. See\n\nLedford, 218 F.3d at 689. Moreover, while we have recognized that a\n\nbroad rendition of the collective knowledge principle could promote\n\nillegal searches, see Meade, 110 F.3d at 194 (expressing concern about\n\napplying the principle to impute the knowledge of an entire law\n\nenforcement agency to officers involved in executing a search), a far\n\nmore limited application of the principle, one which takes into account\n\nonly the knowledge of officers present at the scene and directly\n\ninvolved in effectuating a stop, is unlikely to encourage illegal\n\npolice activity. Therefore, we will determine whether the stop at\n\nissue here was lawful by considering what both Jones and Freire knew\n\nabout Cook’s background and recent activities.\n\n          When we evaluate Cook’s claims by considering the collective\n\nknowledge of all of the officers who participated in the stop, it\n\nbecomes apparent that they had ample grounds to stop Cook and briefly\n\nquestion him about whether he had been involved in an attempted drug\n\ntransaction. As we have noted, Freire testified that he observed Cook\n\nand another man in the midst of what looked to be some sort of exchange\n\nat 1:30 a.m. in an area known for narcotics trafficking; that the men\n\nbroke off their interaction and separated when they saw the approaching\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fpolice officers; and that Cook then entered the illegally parked\n\nExplorer and appeared to be secreting some object in his pants or in\n\nthe seat beneath him. While the information available to Freire does\n\nnot irrefutably establish that Cook had been involved in an attempted\n\ndrug deal, it provided a reasonable basis for his suspicions. No more\n\nis required to justify the officers’ collective decision to briefly\n\ndetain and question Cook. Cf. United States v. Stanley, 915 F.2d 54,\n\n56-57 (1st Cir. 1990) ( Terry stop reasonable where, just past midnight,\n\ndefendant was sitting alone in his car in a high-crime area; appeared\n\nto be engaged in some purposeful though undefined drug-related\n\nactivity; and appeared to hide something under his seat when he saw the\n\nofficers approach). Moreover, because the officers were entitled to\n\nquestion Cook about his suspected participation in a drug deal, their\n\nright to detain him did not dissipate after they determined that he was\n\nnot armed.1\n\n\n     1 Although Cook does not press the point, we also note\nthat the officers were entitled to frisk Cook and search his\nvehicle for weapons. When the officers encountered Cook\napparently engaged in a drug transaction in a high crime area\nat 1:30 a.m., Jones knew that Cook was a member of a gang that\nwas involved in drug trafficking and violence, and that Cook\nhimself had a criminal record for engaging in drug\ntrafficking, violent crimes and at least one firearms offense.\nThe officers also knew that Cook appeared to be alarmed after\nhe saw them, and rose up in his seat as if to conceal\nsomething in his pants or in the back of the vehicle. Under\nthese circumstances, the officers had substantial reason to\nfear that Cook might be armed. See, e.g., Scott, 270 F.3d at\n41; United States v. Gillard, 847 F.2d 21, 25 (1st Cir. 1988);\nUnited States v. Trullo, 809 F.2d 108, 113 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n                                  -9-\n\f                               III.\n\n         For the reasons stated, we affirm the conviction of defendant\n\nDonald Cook.\n\n\n\n\n                               -10-\n\f",

See Chhien, 266 F.3d at 6.\n\n          An investigative stop also must “be reasonably related in\n\nscope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the\n\nfirst place.” Terry, 392 U.S. at 20.

If\n\nhe has a reasonable basis to suspect that the subject of his inquiry\n\nmay be armed, he also may frisk the suspect and undertake a limited\n\nsearch of the passenger compartment of any vehicle in which he is\n\nsitting. See United States v. Scott, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775404\"><a href=\"/opinion/775404/united-states-v-alan-n-scott/\"><span class=\"volume\">270</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 41 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nOnce again, context is vital in determining the permissible scope of an\n\ninvestigative stop.\n\n          Cook invokes these principles in challenging the district\n\ncourt’s suppression ruling. He first argues that the district court\n\nshould have suppressed the cocaine because the officers lacked a\n\nsufficient basis to reasonably suspect that he was illegally carrying\n\na firearm. Alternatively, he contends that, even if the initial stop\n\nwas justified, the officers should have released him immediately after\n\nthey determined that he was not armed. Both arguments depend upon the\n\nunarticulated assumption that the legitimacy of the stop must be\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fdetermined solely from Jones’s perspective, without regard to\n\nobservations made by other officers who jointly participated in the\n\nstop. Cook apparently reasons that because Jones (who first approached\n\nhim) did not personally witness any behavior which suggested that Cook\n\nhad recently participated in an attempted drug deal, the only possible\n\njustification for the stop was Jones’s suspicion that Cook was\n\nillegally carrying a firearm.      This assumption is incorrect.\n\n          As the Supreme Court has repeatedly noted, common sense and\n\npractical considerations must guide judgments about the reasonableness\n\nof searches and seizures.

Sharpe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111378\"><a href=\"/opinion/111378/united-states-v-sharpe/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">675</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n685 (1985) (investigative stops); Illinois v.

Here, common sense suggests that, where law enforcement\n\nofficers are jointly involved in executing an investigative stop, the\n\nknowledge of each officer should be imputed to others jointly involved\n\nin executing the stop. See United States v. Ledford, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769417\"><a href=\"/opinion/769417/united-states-v-carl-l-ledford-and-shane-a-thomas/\"><span class=\"volume\">218</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">684</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 689\n\n(7th Cir. 2000) (applying principle in similar joint-search situation);\n\nsee also United States v. Meade, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197292\"><a href=\"/opinion/197292/united-states-v-meade/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">190</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 193-94 (1st Cir. 1997)\n\n(discussing “Fellow-Officer/Collective-Knowledge” Rule).\n\n          Investigative stops generally occur in a dynamic environment\n\nmarked by the potential for violence. Officers who jointly make such\n\nstops rarely will have an opportunity to confer during the course of\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fthe stop. Basing the legitimacy of the stop solely on what the officer\n\nwho first approaches the suspect knows, rather than on the collective\n\nknowledge of all of the officers who participate directly in carrying\n\nout the stop, thus makes little sense from a practical standpoint. See\n\nLedford, 218 F.3d at 689. Moreover, while we have recognized that a\n\nbroad rendition of the collective knowledge principle could promote\n\nillegal searches, see Meade, 110 F.3d at 194 (expressing concern about\n\napplying the principle to impute the knowledge of an entire law\n\nenforcement agency to officers involved in executing a search), a far\n\nmore limited application of the principle, one which takes into account\n\nonly the knowledge of officers present at the scene and directly\n\ninvolved in effectuating a stop, is unlikely to encourage illegal\n\npolice activity. Therefore, we will determine whether the stop at\n\nissue here was lawful by considering what both Jones and Freire knew\n\nabout Cook’s background and recent activities.\n\n          When we evaluate Cook’s claims by considering the collective\n\nknowledge of all of the officers who participated in the stop, it\n\nbecomes apparent that they had ample grounds to stop Cook and briefly\n\nquestion him about whether he had been involved in an attempted drug\n\ntransaction. As we have noted, Freire testified that he observed Cook\n\nand another man in the midst of what looked to be some sort of exchange\n\nat 1:30 a.m. in an area known for narcotics trafficking; that the men\n\nbroke off their interaction and separated when they saw the approaching\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fpolice officers; and that Cook then entered the illegally parked\n\nExplorer and appeared to be secreting some object in his pants or in\n\nthe seat beneath him. While the information available to Freire does\n\nnot irrefutably establish that Cook had been involved in an attempted\n\ndrug deal, it provided a reasonable basis for his suspicions. No more\n\nis required to justify the officers’ collective decision to briefly\n\ndetain and question Cook. Cf. United States v. Stanley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548685\"><a href=\"/opinion/548685/united-states-v-dennis-g-stanley/\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">54</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n56-57 (1st Cir. 1990) ( Terry stop reasonable where, just past midnight,\n\ndefendant was sitting alone in his car in a high-crime area; appeared\n\nto be engaged in some purposeful though undefined drug-related\n\nactivity; and appeared to hide something under his seat when he saw the\n\nofficers approach). Moreover, because the officers were entitled to\n\nquestion Cook about his suspected participation in a drug deal, their\n\nright to detain him did not dissipate after they determined that he was\n\nnot armed.1\n\n\n     1 Although Cook does not press the point, we also note\nthat the officers were entitled to frisk Cook and search his\nvehicle for weapons. When the officers encountered Cook\napparently engaged in a drug transaction in a high crime area\nat 1:30 a.m., Jones knew that Cook was a member of a gang that\nwas involved in drug trafficking and violence, and that Cook\nhimself had a criminal record for engaging in drug\ntrafficking, violent crimes and at least one firearms offense.\nThe officers also knew that Cook appeared to be alarmed after\nhe saw them, and rose up in his seat as if to conceal\nsomething in his pants or in the back of the vehicle. Under\nthese circumstances, the officers had substantial reason to\nfear that Cook might be armed. See, e.g., Scott, 270 F.3d at\n41; United States v.
