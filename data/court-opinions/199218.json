Ten members of a conspiracy\n\ndefrauded two banks through a counterfeit check cashing scheme.\n\nDefendant Rolando Solares was among them, and appeals from three\n\naspects of his sentence following his guilty plea.\n\n         Solares and the others obtained counterfeit payroll\n\nchecks that appeared to be issued by A & H Manufacturing, a\n\nbusiness based in Rhode Island.   The conspirators also obtained\n\ncounterfeit identification cards in the names of the payees\n\nlisted on the counterfeit checks. Acting alone and in groups of\n\ntwo or three, the conspirators then quickly cashed 224 of these\n\ncounterfeit checks at fifteen different Rhode Island branches of\n\nCitizens Bank by using the false identification.     This scheme\n\ntook place over three days, from Friday, February 26, 1999,\n\nthrough Sunday, February 28, 1999.    This took advantage of the\n\nfact that the company, A & H, was closed for the weekend and so\n\nCitizens Bank was unable to contact the business to verify the\n\nauthenticity of any of the checks.    The total loss to Citizens\n\nwas $87,586.80.\n\n         In a second round, an identical scheme was employed to\n\ndefraud Fleet Bank, except this time a new company was used, the\n\n\n\n                              -3-\n\fCavicchio Greenhouses.   The total loss to Fleet was documented\n\nto be $20,069.85.\n\n         Solares pled guilty to bank fraud and conspiracy. See\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1344 (bank fraud); 18 U.S.C. § 371 (conspiracy to\n\ncommit bank fraud).   There were nine co-defendants.     On appeal,\n\nSolares argues three objections to his sentence.      He says that\n\nthe district court erred (1) in making a four level upward\n\nadjustment on the basis that Solares was a leader and organizer,\n\nand in not considering instead a two level adjustment on a\n\nfinding that he played only a managerial or supervisory role;\n\n(2) in ordering restitution of $107,656.65 for all losses from\n\nthe conspiracy; and (3) in ordering that the defendant remain\n\noutside the United States if he was deported by the INS.          We\n\ntake each argument in turn.\n\nUpward Adjustments\n\n         The   Pre-Sentence   Report    recommended   that   Solares\n\nreceive a four level upward adjustment for leadership and as an\n\norganizer under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(a). The PSR recommendation was\n\nbased on the fact that Solares recruited co-defendant Luis\n\nAvelar and organized the out-of-state defendants as part of the\n\nsecond phase of the conspiracy.        Solares's counsel filed no\n\n                               -4-\n\fobjection to the PSR and at sentencing said that he was in\n\nagreement with the factual report as well as the Sentencing\n\nGuidelines computations in the PSR.\n\n         The   government   says   that   by   such   agreement,   the\n\ndefendant forfeited or waived his right to challenge the upward\n\nadjustment.    We choose not to explore again the differences\n\nbetween forfeiture and waiver but will instead assume arguendo\n\nthat Solares should have the benefit of plain error review. See\n\nUnited States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993).\n\n         The defendant’s main argument is that the court did not\n\nmake sufficient findings to support its conclusions.               The\n\ncourt’s findings were that Solares recruited other members of\n\nthe conspiracy and that he took a greater share in the proceeds\n\nof the criminal activity.    The defendant denies that there is\n\nevidence he took a greater share of the proceeds and says that\n\nthe evidence showed only that he recruited defendant Avelar.\n\nFrom the record and the PSR, it is clear that Solares was the\n\nonly Providence-based defendant, apart from defendant Avelar.\n\nSolares recruited defendant Avelar in the second phase.        It is\n\nreasonable to infer that Solares was the one familiar with the\n\nProvidence area and with the local bank branches, that he was in\n\n                               -5-\n\fcharge of the operations, and that he instructed the out-of-\n\nstate defendants about the logistics of the second phase of the\n\noperation.   Telephone records show that seven phone calls were\n\nplaced by out-of-state defendants to his residence just before\n\nthe second phase began.   It is reasonable to infer that Solares\n\nrecruited the others, just as he had recruited Avelar.    Thus,\n\nmany of the seven factors we have identified to show whether a\n\ndefendant qualifies as an organizer or leader were met.     See\n\nUnited States v. Robbio, 186 F.3d 37, 45 (1st Cir. 1999)\n\n(listing factors), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 602 (2000).     The\n\nrecord thus supports the district court’s determination, and\n\nthere is no error.\n\n         Where the defendant did not challenge the PSR, we will\n\nnot entertain the defendant's final argument that the court\n\nfailed to state adequately in open court the reasons for its\n\nimposition of the particular sentence.     The court was on no\n\nnotice that there was any issue as to the court’s statement of\n\nreasons, and the defendant, who created that situation, cannot\n\ngain advantage from it.\n\nAmount of the Restitution Award\n\n\n\n                              -6-\n\f           Solares   objects    to    the    restitution   order,   which\n\nrequires him to pay back the entire loss to the two banks.\n\nUnder the Victim and Witness Protection Act, 18 U.S.C. §§\n\n3663(a), 3664(a), restitution awards are limited to \"the loss\n\ncaused by the specific conduct that is the basis of the offense\n\nof conviction.\"      Hughey v. United States, 495 U.S. 411, 413\n\n(1990).    Under the VWPA, \"in the case of an offense that\n\ninvolves as an element a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of\n\ncriminal activity,\" a victim is defined as \"any person directly\n\nharmed by the defendant’s criminal conduct in the course of the\n\nscheme, conspiracy, or pattern\"            18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(2).      We\n\nhave held that a defendant in a conspiracy is liable for all\n\nreasonably foreseeable losses caused to the victims by the\n\nconspiracy.   See United States v. Collins, 209 F.3d 1, 4 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).\n\n           Once   again,   as   to    this   issue,   Solares   filed   no\n\nobjection to the PSR, and indeed said that he affirmatively\n\nagreed with the facts and Sentencing Guidelines calculations in\n\nthe PSR.   Again, we give him the benefit of plain error review.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, it was quite reasonable for the\n\ndistrict court to conclude that this was a well organized\n\n                                     -7-\n\fconspiracy, and that Solares himself organized and was deeply\n\ninvolved in it.     Thus, he could have reasonably foreseen the\n\nlosses at issue.    There was no error.\n\nCondition of Supervised Release\n\n         Solares    argues   that     the     district   court    erred   at\n\nsentencing   when   it   ordered,    as   a   condition   of     supervised\n\nrelease, that if Solares were deported, he was to remain outside\n\nthe U.S. for the entire term of his supervised release.              Again\n\nhe failed to object to this condition, and review is at most for\n\nplain error.\n\n         Solares concedes a key distinction here. While we have\n\nheld that a district court may not order a defendant to be\n\ndeported as a condition of supervised release, United States v.\n\nSanchez, 923 F.2d 236, 237 (1st Cir. 1991), the court may, if\n\nthe defendant is deported, provide, in the words of the statute,\n\n\"as a condition of supervised release, that he be deported and\n\nremain outside the United States,\"          18 U.S.C. § 3583(d).\n\n         Solares argues first that under Sanchez, this court’s\n\ninterpretation of § 3583(d) indicates that it is not to disturb\n\nthe power of the Executive Branch.            That is an overreading of\n\nSanchez, which does not prohibit the order at issue here.                 His\n\n                                    -8-\n\fnext argument is that to the extent that the statute authorizes\n\nthe   type   of   order   issued   here,   the   statute   violates   the\n\nseparation of powers doctrine.       We do not see why, and the point\n\nis not argued, and so is waived.         Solares also makes a vague due\n\nprocess claim which again we reject as not having been argued\n\nand as facially appearing to have no merit.                To the extent\n\nSolares is raising a hypothetical future concern about the\n\neffect of the court order if the INS were willing to readmit him\n\nto the country, that issue can be faced later.         If the district\n\ncourt order stood as an obstacle at that time, a point on which\n\nwe express no opinion, Solares would be free then to ask for a\n\nmodification.\n\n             For these reasons, the sentence is affirmed in all\n\npertinent respects.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f",

The total loss to Citizens was $87,586.80.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a second round, an identical scheme was employed to defraud Fleet Bank, except this time a new company was used, the Cavicchio Greenhouses. The total loss to Fleet was documented to be $20,069.85.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Solares pled guilty to bank fraud and conspiracy. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344 (bank fraud); 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371 (conspiracy to commit bank fraud). There were nine co-defendants. On appeal, Solares argues three objections to his sentence. He says that the district court erred (1) in making a four level upward adjustment on the basis that Solares was a leader and organizer, and in not considering instead a two level adjustment on a finding that he played only a managerial or supervisory role; (2) in ordering restitution of $107,656.65 for all losses from the conspiracy; and (3) in ordering that the defendant remain outside the United States if he was deported by the INS. We take each argument in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Upward Adjustments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Pre-Sentence Report recommended that Solares receive a four level upward adjustment for leadership and as an organizer under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(a). The PSR recommendation was based on the fact that Solares recruited co-defendant Luis Avelar and organized the out-of-state defendants as part of the second phase of the conspiracy. Solares's counsel filed no objection to the PSR and at sentencing said that he was in agreement with the factual report as well as the Sentencing Guidelines computations in the PSR.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government says that by such agreement, the defendant forfeited or waived his right to challenge the upward adjustment. We choose not to explore again the differences between forfeiture and waiver but will instead assume arguendo that Solares should have the benefit of plain error review. SeeUnited States v. Olano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, 732 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant's main argument is that the court did not make sufficient findings to support its conclusions. The court's findings were that Solares recruited other members of the conspiracy and that he took a greater share in the proceeds of the criminal activity. The defendant denies that there is evidence he took a greater share of the proceeds and says that the evidence showed only that he recruited defendant Avelar. From the record and the PSR, it is clear that Solares was the only Providence-based defendant, apart from defendant Avelar. Solares recruited defendant Avelar in the second phase. It is reasonable to infer that Solares was the one familiar with the Providence area and with the local bank branches, that he was in charge of the operations, and that he instructed the out-of-state defendants about the logistics of the second phase of the operation. Telephone records show that seven phone calls were placed by out-of-state defendants to his residence just before the second phase began. It is reasonable to infer that Solares recruited the others, just as he had recruited Avelar. Thus, many of the seven factors we have identified to show whether a defendant qualifies as an organizer or leader were met. SeeUnited States v. Robbio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198587\"><a href=\"/opinion/198587/united-states-v-robbio/\"><span class=\"volume\">186</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 45 (1st Cir. 1999) (listing factors), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">602</span></span> (2000). The record thus supports the district court's determination, and there is no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where the defendant did not challenge the PSR, we will not entertain the defendant's final argument that the court failed to state adequately in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence. The court was on no notice that there was any issue as to the court's statement of reasons, and the defendant, who created that situation, cannot gain advantage from it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Amount of the Restitution Award</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Solares objects to the restitution order, which requires him to pay back the entire loss to the two banks. Under the Victim and Witness Protection Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3663(a), 3664(a), restitution awards are limited to \"the loss caused by the specific conduct that is the basis of the offense of conviction.\" Hughey v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112428\"><a href=\"/opinion/112428/hughey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">411</span></a></span>, 413 (1990). Under the VWPA, \"in the case of an offense that involves as an element a scheme, conspiracy, or pattern of criminal activity,\" a victim is defined as \"any person directly harmed by the defendant's criminal conduct in the course of the scheme, conspiracy, or pattern\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663(a)(2). We have held that a defendant in a conspiracy is liable for all reasonably foreseeable losses caused to the victims by the conspiracy. See United States v. Collins, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 4 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once again, as to this issue, Solares filed no objection to the PSR, and indeed said that he affirmatively agreed with the facts and Sentencing Guidelines calculations in the PSR. Again, we give him the benefit of plain error review. For the reasons stated above, it was quite reasonable for the district court to conclude that this was a well organized conspiracy, and that Solares himself organized and was deeply involved in it. Thus, he could have reasonably foreseen the losses at issue. There was no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Condition of Supervised Release</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Solares argues that the district court erred at sentencing when it ordered, as a condition of supervised release, that if Solares were deported, he was to remain outside the U.S. for the entire term of his supervised release. Again he failed to object to this condition, and review is at most for plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Solares concedes a key distinction here. While we have held that a district court may not order a defendant to be deported as a condition of supervised release, United States v. Sanchez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"554024\"><a href=\"/opinion/554024/united-states-v-miguel-sanchez/\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">236</span></a></span>, 237 (1st Cir. 1991), the court may, if the defendant is deported, provide, in the words of the statute, \"as a condition of supervised release, that he be deported and remain outside the United States,\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Solares argues first that under Sanchez, this court's interpretation of &#167; 3583(d) indicates that it is not to disturb the power of the Executive Branch. That is an overreading of Sanchez, which does not prohibit the order at issue here. His next argument is that to the extent that the statute authorizes the type of order issued here, the statute violates the separation of powers doctrine. We do not see why, and the point is not argued, and so is waived. Solares also makes a vague due process claim which again we reject as not having been argued and as facially appearing to have no merit. To the extent Solares is raising a hypothetical future concern about the effect of the court order if the INS were willing to readmit him to the country, that issue can be faced later. If the district court order stood as an obstacle at that time, a point on which we express no opinion, Solares would be free then to ask for a modification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, the sentence is affirmed in all pertinent respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
