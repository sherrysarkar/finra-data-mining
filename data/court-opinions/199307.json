Bankruptcy debtor Steven\n\nSnyder appeals from a decision of the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel\n\n(BAP).   The BAP held that Snyder could not completely avoid a\n\nlien on his residence, which he owned with his spouse as a\n\ntenancy by the entirety, because his interest in that property\n\nwas equal to its full market value.   We affirm.\n\n                         I.   Background\n\n          Snyder and his spouse own their residence as tenants\n\nby the entirety pursuant to a tenancy created after February 11,\n\n1980. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209, § 1.    Snyder is three years\n\nolder than his spouse.   On September 16, 1997, Snyder's spouse\n\nfiled a declaration of homestead with the Norfolk Registry of\n\nDeeds.\n\n          The parties have stipulated that the fair market value\n\nof the residential property is $239,000.00.     The property is\n\nsubject to a lien in favor of the Collector of Taxes of Randolph\n\nin the amount of $764.99; a first mortgage to Randolph Savings\n\nBank in the amount of $160,413.28; a second mortgage to Randolph\n\nSavings Bank in the amount of $5,385.55; and a lien in favor of\n\nRockland Trust Company (\"Rockland\") in the amount of $65,000.00.\n\n\n\n                               -2-\n\f               On March 2, 1998, Snyder filed for relief in the\n\nBankruptcy Court pursuant to Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.\n\nOn May 8, 1998, he filed a Motion to Avoid Lien pursuant to 11\n\nU.S.C. § 522(f)(1)(A), in which he asserted that the Rockland\n\nlien impaired his exemption in his residence.\n\n             On March 18, 1999, the Bankruptcy Court ruled that\n\nSnyder had an \"unitary\" interest in his residence, as did his\n\nspouse.      In re Snyder, 231 B.R. 437, 442 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1999).\n\nThe court rejected Snyder's contention that his interest is no\n\nmore than half the value of the property.               Id. at 443-44.\n\nNoting that Snyder's interest in the property is \"indeterminate\"\n\nuntil the tenancy is terminated, it entered a provisional order\n\npremised on Snyder's interest being equal to the full value of\n\nthe property, allowing       Snyder to avoid only a small portion of\n\nthe   lien    ($8,286.82).    The   court   permitted   the   parties   to\n\npetition for reconsideration in the event that Snyder's tenancy\n\nby the entirety is terminated.            Id. at 445.   Snyder filed a\n\nmotion to amend or alter the judgment, which the Bankruptcy\n\nCourt denied.\n\n             Next, Snyder appealed from the decision to the BAP.\n\nThe BAP held that Snyder's interest in the property, as a\n\ntenancy by the entirety, was equal to its full market value.            In\n\nre Snyder, 249 B.R. 40, 46 (B.A.P. 1st Cir. 1999).            It rejected\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fthe provisional aspects of the Bankruptcy Court's decision,\n\nruling that the relevant analysis required a \"summary proceeding\n\nsusceptible to a quick and binding resolution.\"                The BAP also\n\nruled that the non-debtor spouse's homestead should not be taken\n\ninto account when determining whether a lien should be avoided\n\nunder 11 U.S.C. § 522(f).\n\n                           II.    Discussion\n\n           In In re Healthco Int'l, Inc., 132 F.3d 104 (1st Cir.\n\n1997), we set forth the standard of review for appeals that come\n\nto us by way of the BAP:\n\n           [W]e  focus   on   the  bankruptcy   court's\n           decision, scrutinize that court's findings\n           of fact for clear error, and afford de novo\n           review to its conclusions of law. . . Since\n           this is exactly the same regimen that the\n           intermediate appellate tribunal must use, we\n           exhibit no particular deference to the\n           conclusions of that tribunal (be it the\n           district court or the BAP).\n\nId. at 107 (internal citation omitted).                   On appeal, Snyder\n\nasserts that the courts below erred in concluding that his\n\ninterest in his residence was one hundred percent as of the\n\npetition   date,   and   that   the    BAP   erred   in    disregarding   his\n\nspouse's homestead.      We disagree.\n\n           First, we address Snyder's contention that his interest\n\nin the property was fifty percent or less.            The bankruptcy code\n\npermits a debtor to avoid the fixing of a lien on a debtor's\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\finterest in property only to the extent that the lien impairs an\n\nexemption to which, but for the lien, the debtor would have been\n\nentitled.    11 U.S.C. § 522(f).                The code provides in relevant\n\npart:\n\n            For the purposes of this subsection, a lien\n            shall be considered to impair an exemption\n            to the extent that the sum of--\n            (i) the lien,\n            (ii) all other liens on the property; and\n            (iii) the amount of the exemption that the\n            debtor could claim if there were no liens on\n            the property;\n            exceeds the value that the debtor's interest\n            in the property would have in the absence of\n            any liens.\n\n11 U.S.C. § 522(f)(2)(A).\n\n            The   sole     dispute    in    this    case   involves   the   final\n\nvariable in the equation:           the value of Snyder's interest in his\n\nresidence in the absence of any liens.               The bankruptcy court, as\n\naffirmed by the BAP, based the lien avoidance calculation on a\n\nvaluation of Snyder's interest in the property at one hundred\n\npercent.    It calculated as follows:              the sum of Rockland's lien\n\n($65,000.00), all other liens on the property ($166,536.82), and\n\nthe amount of the exemption ($15,750.00) is $247,286.82, which\n\nexceeds    the    agreed    value    of    the     property   ($239,000.00)    by\n\n$8,286.82.       Snyder, 231 B.R. at 441 n.1.              Hence, it permitted\n\nSnyder to avoid the lien only to the extent of $8,286.82.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\f          Snyder contends that if his interest is determined to\n\nbe fifty percent or less, he may avoid either the entirety of\n\nthe lien or at least a greater portion of the lien than was\n\npermitted by the courts below.*   He premises his argument on the\n\nfacts that he is male and older than his spouse, and hence will\n\nlikely predecease her.    He urges us to adopt an \"actuarial\n\napproach\" in which expert evidence of life expectancy should be\n\nadmitted and analyzed to determine his precise interest in his\n\nresidence.\n\n          Snyder waived this argument, however.   At the hearing\n\non his Motion to Avoid Lien, the Bankruptcy Court asked him if\n\nhe wished to submit actuarial evidence; he declined, citing the\n\ncost of expert testimony.     We need not consider an issue so\n\nexplicitly abandoned below.   Cf. Sheehan v. Marr, 207 F.3d 35,\n\n42 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n          Snyder contends that at the time of the hearing, a\n\nrecent Bankruptcy Court case indicated that even if his interest\n\nwas valued at fifty percent, he would be able to fully avoid the\n\nlien.   See In re Pascucci, 225 B.R. 25 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1998),\n\nabrogated by Nelson v. Scala, 192 F.3d 32, 35 n. 3 (1st Cir.\n\n1999) (pointing out the sparse and divided case law on point).\n\n\n\n    *These calculations do not include the effect of Snyder's\nwife's homestead, which we address infra.\n\n                               -6-\n\fTherefore, he now argues, there was no need at that time to\n\nintroduce actuarial evidence that would have proved that his\n\ninterest was less than fifty percent.      Given the then-unsettled\n\nstate of the case law and its uncertain applicability to this\n\nmatter, however, we are not convinced that Snyder should be\n\nexcused from deliberately forgoing his opportunity to present\n\nthat evidence.      Moreover, Snyder has consistently advocated\n\nusing an actuarial analysis to determine that he had a fifty\n\npercent (as opposed to a less-than-fifty-percent) interest in\n\nthe property, and makes no developed argument on appeal that his\n\ninterest should be calculated at fifty percent in the absence of\n\nan actuarial approach.**\n\n          The second issue Snyder raises on appeal concerns the\n\nimpact   of   his   spouse's   homestead   exemption   on   the   lien\n\navoidance.    On September 16, 1997, Snyder's spouse filed a\n\ndeclaration of homestead with the Norfolk Registry of Deeds,\n\nwhereby an owner may obtain a $100,000.00 exemption for the\n\nbenefit of his or her family.       Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 188, § 1.\n\nSnyder now contends that this homestead exemption should be\n\n\n    **At oral argument, Snyder also challenged the decision of\nthe BAP to modify the Bankruptcy Court's provisional order and\nto fix the debtor's interest at one hundred percent. However,\nas this issue was not well briefed, it is waived.     Further,\nwhile the Bankruptcy Court's approach was thoughtful and\ncreative, we agree with the BAP's decision to reject the\nprovisional aspect of the order.\n\n                                 -7-\n\ffactored into the valuation of his interest in the property\n\nunder 11 U.S.C. § 522(f).\n\n            It appears that Snyder did not make this argument to\n\nthe Bankruptcy Court until his motion to amend or alter the\n\njudgment, although he had appended schedules referencing his\n\nspouse's declaration of homestead to his Motion to Avoid Lien.\n\nAccordingly, the Bankruptcy Court did not address the homestead\n\nissue in its opinion.         It is well-established that a party\n\ncannot raise an issue for the first time on a motion to amend a\n\njudgment.     See F.D.I.C. v. World Univ. Inc., 978 F.2d 10, 16\n\n(1st Cir. 1992).\n\n            In any event, we agree with the BAP's conclusion that\n\n\"[o]n the facts of this case, the spouse's homestead election is\n\nnot part of the equation under section 522(f).\"                   Snyder, 249\n\nB.R. at 47.    Section 522(b) of the bankruptcy code requires the\n\ndebtor to elect either the federal exemptions or the state\n\nexemptions.    Here, Snyder elected the federal exemptions, which,\n\nfor purposes of this appeal, constituted a fixed amount of\n\n$15,750.00.    11 U.S.C. § 522(d)(1).         The section on which Snyder\n\nrelies, § 522(f)(2)(A), pertains here only to liens and federal\n\nexemptions;    we   have    found   no      authority   suggesting      that   a\n\nspouse's    homestead      election      falls   into    either    of    these\n\ncategories.\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n            -9-\n\f",

The bankruptcy court, as\n\naffirmed by the BAP, based the lien avoidance calculation on a\n\nvaluation of Snyder's interest in the property at one hundred\n\npercent.    It calculated as follows:              the sum of Rockland's lien\n\n($65,000.00), all other liens on the property ($166,536.82), and\n\nthe amount of the exemption ($15,750.00) is $247,286.82, which\n\nexceeds    the    agreed    value    of    the     property   ($239,000.00)    by\n\n$8,286.82.       Snyder, 231 B.R. at 441 n.1.              Hence, it permitted\n\nSnyder to avoid the lien only to the extent of $8,286.82.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\f          Snyder contends that if his interest is determined to\n\nbe fifty percent or less, he may avoid either the entirety of\n\nthe lien or at least a greater portion of the lien than was\n\npermitted by the courts below.*   He premises his argument on the\n\nfacts that he is male and older than his spouse, and hence will\n\nlikely predecease her.    He urges us to adopt an \"actuarial\n\napproach\" in which expert evidence of life expectancy should be\n\nadmitted and analyzed to determine his precise interest in his\n\nresidence.\n\n          Snyder waived this argument, however.   At the hearing\n\non his Motion to Avoid Lien, the Bankruptcy Court asked him if\n\nhe wished to submit actuarial evidence; he declined, citing the\n\ncost of expert testimony.     We need not consider an issue so\n\nexplicitly abandoned below.   Cf. Sheehan v. Marr, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768059\"><a href=\"/opinion/768059/arthur-joseph-sheehan-v-james-marr-police-chief-city-of-gloucester/\"><span class=\"volume\">207</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n42 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n          Snyder contends that at the time of the hearing, a\n\nrecent Bankruptcy Court case indicated that even if his interest\n\nwas valued at fifty percent, he would be able to fully avoid the\n\nlien.

Given the then-unsettled\n\nstate of the case law and its uncertain applicability to this\n\nmatter, however, we are not convinced that Snyder should be\n\nexcused from deliberately forgoing his opportunity to present\n\nthat evidence.      Moreover, Snyder has consistently advocated\n\nusing an actuarial analysis to determine that he had a fifty\n\npercent (as opposed to a less-than-fifty-percent) interest in\n\nthe property, and makes no developed argument on appeal that his\n\ninterest should be calculated at fifty percent in the absence of\n\nan actuarial approach.**\n\n          The second issue Snyder raises on appeal concerns the\n\nimpact   of   his   spouse's   homestead   exemption   on   the   lien\n\navoidance.    On September 16, 1997, Snyder's spouse filed a\n\ndeclaration of homestead with the Norfolk Registry of Deeds,\n\nwhereby an owner may obtain a $100,000.00 exemption for the\n\nbenefit of his or her family.       Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 188, § 1.\n\nSnyder now contends that this homestead exemption should be\n\n\n    **At oral argument, Snyder also challenged the decision of\nthe BAP to modify the Bankruptcy Court's provisional order and\nto fix the debtor's interest at one hundred percent. However,\nas this issue was not well briefed, it is waived.     Further,\nwhile the Bankruptcy Court's approach was thoughtful and\ncreative, we agree with the BAP's decision to reject the\nprovisional aspect of the order.\n\n                                 -7-\n\ffactored into the valuation of his interest in the property\n\nunder 11 U.S.C. § 522(f).\n\n            It appears that Snyder did not make this argument to\n\nthe Bankruptcy Court until his motion to amend or alter the\n\njudgment, although he had appended schedules referencing his\n\nspouse's declaration of homestead to his Motion to Avoid Lien.\n\nAccordingly, the Bankruptcy Court did not address the homestead\n\nissue in its opinion.         It is well-established that a party\n\ncannot raise an issue for the first time on a motion to amend a\n\njudgment.     See F.D.I.C. v. World Univ.

Section 522(b) of the bankruptcy code requires the\n\ndebtor to elect either the federal exemptions or the state\n\nexemptions.
