D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\nSelya, Circuit Judge,\r\n\nBownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\nand Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\nMark L. Randall, with whom Daniel G. Lilley Law Offices, P.A.was on brief, for appellant.\r\nK. Douglas Erdmann, with whom William J. Kayatta, Jr. and Pierce Atwood were on brief, for appellee.\r\n\nApril 29, 1998\r\n\nSELYA, Circuit Judge. Plaintiff-appellant Ronald R.\r\nLaChapelle appeals from an order dismissing his civil action for\r\nbreach of contract and intentional infliction of emotional distress\r\nagainst defendant-appellee Berkshire Life Insurance Company (the\r\nCompany).  For the reasons elucidated below, we affirm.\r\n                           I\r\nThe district court dismissed the appellant's suit on a\r\nRule 12(b)(6) motion.  Accordingly, we, like the trial court, must\r\naccept as true the well-pleaded factual allegations of the\r\ncomplaint, draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in the\r\nplaintiff's favor, and determine whether the complaint, so read,\r\nlimns facts sufficient to justify recovery on any cognizable\r\ntheory.  See Dartmouth Review v. Dartmouth College, 889 F.2d 13, 16\r\n(1st Cir. 1989).  In arriving at this determination, we\r\ndifferentiate between well-pleaded facts, on the one hand, and\r\n\"bald assertions, unsupportable conclusions, periphrastic\r\ncircumlocution, and the like,\" on the other hand; the former must\r\nbe credited, but the latter can safely be ignored.  See Aulson v.\r\nBlanchard, 83 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\nThe operative pleading here is the amended complaint.  It\r\nalleges that the appellant, a stockbroker, obtained a policy of\r\nlong-term disability insurance from the Company in 1986.  The\r\ninsurance contract contained a standard clause, tracking Me. Rev.\r\nStat. Ann. tit. 24-A,  2715 (West 1990), which required the\r\ninsured to file written proof of any insured loss with the Company\r\nand to bring any legal action predicated on the policy within three\r\nyears of the accrual date.\r\nOn February 4, 1991, the appellant was found floating in\r\nthe Androscoggin River and promptly hospitalized.  Doctors treated\r\nhim for frostbite, hypothermia, and amnesia.  They also performed\r\na psychiatric evaluation.  Following his discharge on February 8,\r\n1991, the appellant admitted himself to another hospital because of\r\nhis emotional difficulties.  He stayed there for less than two\r\nweeks.  Psychiatrists attributed his depression to severe stress,\r\nresulting from career troubles and pending legal proceedings.\r\nThe appellant furnished written proof of loss to the\r\nCompany, backed by medical evaluations declaring him to be totally\r\ndisabled from performing his usual occupation.  The Company honored\r\nthe claim and began paying benefits.  In due season, LaChapelle's\r\nlegal bedevilment bore bitter fruit and he pled guilty to criminal\r\ncharges of theft by misapplication of property.  The state court\r\nimposed an incarcerative sentence and imprisoned the appellant in\r\nJune 1992.  That month, the Company informed him that it would\r\ndiscontinue payments (presumably on the theory that his immurement,\r\nnot his depression, kept him from functioning as a stockbroker),\r\nbut that it might resume payments after his release.  The Company\r\nalso offered to settle all policy-related claims for $15,000.  The\r\nappellant refused the settlement offer but took no immediate action\r\nto contest the discontinuance of benefits.\r\nIn 1995, the appellant filed another claim for disability\r\nbenefits, asserting that he was still unable to work as a result of\r\nhis original disability.  The Company denied this claim and the\r\nappellant did not pursue it.  Two years later, however, he shifted\r\nhis focus and sued the Company on the ground that it had breached\r\nthe policy covenants by unilaterally terminating his benefits when\r\nhe went to prison in 1992.  He appended supplemental claims for\r\nintentional infliction of emotional distress and violation of\r\nMaine's late payment of claims statute, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit.\r\n24-A,  2436(1) (West 1990), directed to the same event.\r\nThe Company moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to\r\nstate an actionable claim.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  After\r\nthe appellant amended the complaint, the district court granted the\r\nCompany's motion.  The court concluded that the breach of contract\r\nclaim was time-barred by virtue of the insurance policy's internal\r\nthree-year limitations period and that the facts alleged in the\r\namended complaint were insufficient to ground an equitable\r\nestoppel.  The court also held that the amended complaint failed to\r\nstate cognizable claims for either intentional infliction of\r\nemotional distress or the untimely payment of an insurance claim.\r\nWe review de novo a district court's allowance of a Rule\r\n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.  See Garita Hotel Ltd. Partnership v.\r\nPonce Fed. Bank, 958 F.2d 15, 17 (1st Cir. 1992).  Inasmuch as the\r\nappellant premised federal jurisdiction on diversity of citizenship\r\nand the existence of a controversy in the requisite amount, 28\r\nU.S.C.  1332(a) (1994), we apply the substantive law of Maine. \r\nSee Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 78 (1938); Woods-Leberv. Hyatt Hotels of P.R., Inc., 124 F.3d 47, 50 (1st Cir. 1997). \r\nBecause the appellant has abandoned his claim under Me. Rev. Stat.\r\nAnn. tit. 24-A,  2436(1), we focus exclusively on breach of\r\ncontract and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\r\n                           II\r\nWe first address the breach of contract claim.  Granting\r\na motion to dismiss based on a limitations defense is entirely\r\nappropriate when the pleader's allegations leave no doubt that an\r\nasserted claim is time-barred.  See, e.g., Street v. Vose, 936 F.2d\r\n38, 39 (1st Cir. 1991); Kali Seafood, Inc. v. Howe Corp., 887 F.2d\r\n7, 9 (1st Cir. 1989).  Here, the appellant concedes that the three-\r\nyear limitations period, if untolled, bars his contract claim.  He\r\nmaintains, however, that the doctrine of equitable estoppel,\r\ncorrectly applied, halts the running of the limitations period and\r\nvitiates any temporally oriented defense.  The district court did\r\nnot agree.  Nor do we.\r\nIn Maine, \"the gist of an estoppel barring the defendant\r\nfrom invoking the defense of the statute of limitations is that the\r\ndefendant has conducted himself in a manner which actually induces\r\nthe plaintiff not to take timely legal action on a claim.\" \r\nTownsend v. Appel, 446 A.2d 1132, 1134 (Me. 1982).  Of course, the\r\nlack of a timely filing cannot be attributed to the defendant's\r\nconduct unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that he intended to\r\nfile suit during the permitted period, see id., that the\r\ndefendant's actions led him to refrain from doing so, see Robertsv. Maine Bonding &amp; Casualty Co., 404 A.2d 238, 241 (Me. 1979), and\r\nthat his forbearance was objectively reasonable, see Hanusek v.\r\nSouthern Me. Med. Ctr., 584 A.2d 634, 636-37 (Me. 1990).\r\nThe appellant was on clear notice of his burden.  His\r\noriginal complaint in this case did not allege an estoppel, but he\r\nfiled an amended complaint in an effort to correct that\r\nshortcoming.  Even then, he failed to sketch a factual predicate\r\nthat would warrant the application of equitable estoppel.  For\r\nexample, the appellant does not allege that he intended to sue\r\nduring the prescriptive period.  More importantly, as evidence of\r\nconduct that ostensibly dissuaded him from taking timely legal\r\naction, the appellant mentions only the Company's statement to the\r\neffect that it might resume payments after his release.  As a\r\nmatter of law, this assertion is insufficient to induce a\r\nreasonable person to sit on his rights.  See Townsend, 446 A.2d at\r\n1134.\r\nWe need not belabor the obvious.  The Company did not\r\nmislead the appellant, but, rather, told him straightaway that it\r\nintended to stop paying benefits.  It then acted on that stated\r\nintention.  This should have been a reveille, not a lullaby.  By\r\nthat we mean it should have galvanized a reasonable person into\r\naction, not lulled him into a false sense of security.  The\r\nCompany's additional statement   that it \"might\" subsequently\r\nresume payments   conveyed no assurance and does not alter the\r\nrelevant calculus.  In all events, even if the appellant relied on\r\nthe Company's statement to his detriment, such reliance fails, as\r\na matter of law, to meet the standard of objective reasonableness\r\nimposed under Maine law.  See Hanusek, 584 A.2d at 636-37; City of\r\nAuburn v. Desgrosseilliers, 578 A.2d 712, 714 (Me. 1990).\r\nLaChapelle parries by asserting that, given his fragile\r\nmental state, he could not be expected to appreciate and act upon\r\nthe Company's volte-face.  Under certain circumstances, perhaps,\r\nthe standard of objective reasonableness might yield to accommodate\r\na plaintiff with severe mental disabilities (especially if those\r\ndisabilities are known to the defendant).  But this is not such an\r\ninstance.  Though the appellant suffered from depression, he was\r\ncompetent enough to bring his initial claim in a timely fashion, to\r\nmull (and promptly reject) the insurer's settlement proposal, and,\r\nthree years later, to file another claim with the Company.  He does\r\nnot allege that his condition worsened over time (indeed, at oral\r\nargument in this court, his counsel stated that it had not).  In\r\nshort, there is nothing of record here that suggests a lack of\r\ncapacity or a disability severe enough to warrant an exception to,\r\nor a relaxation of, the rule of objective reasonableness.\r\nThe appellant has one last arrow in his quiver.  In his\r\nreply brief in this court, he attempts to repair his ruptured\r\nbreach of contract claim by arguing that, under the public policy\r\nof Maine as expressed in Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 14,  853, his\r\nimprisonment tolled the limitations period.  The attempt fails. \r\nFor one thing, it seems fairly obvious that this statutory tolling\r\nprovision does not apply to actions brought on insurance policies. \r\nWe need not resolve this point definitively, however, because the\r\nargument is procedurally defaulted.  It is settled beyond\r\nperadventure that \"absent the most extraordinary circumstances,\r\nlegal theories not raised squarely in the lower court cannot be\r\nbroached for the first time on appeal.\"  Teamsters, Chauffeurs,\r\nWarehousemen &amp; Helpers Union, Local No. 59 v. Superline Transp.\r\nCo., 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir. 1992); see also Sandstrom v.\r\nChemLawn Corp., 904 F.2d 83, 87 (1st Cir. 1990) (explaining that an\r\nargument raised for the first time in a reply brief is procedurally\r\ninfirm).  There is nothing about this case that counsels against\r\nenforcing this salutary principle.  Because the appellant failed to\r\nraise the statutory tolling argument in the court below, we will\r\nnot entertain it here.\r\nWe have said enough on this score.  For aught that\r\nappears, the appellant simply neglected to bring suit against the\r\nCompany in a timeous fashion.  On these facts, neither equitable\r\nestoppel nor any other tolling device is available to him.  Cf.Sandstrom, 904 F.2d at 87 (remarking that \"equity, after all,\r\nministers to the vigilant, not to those who slumber upon their\r\nrights\").\r\n                          III\r\nThis leaves us with the appellant's tort claim.  To\r\nrecover for intentional infliction of emotional distress in Maine,\r\na plaintiff must show:\r\n(1) the defendant intentionally or recklessly\r\ninflicted severe emotional distress or was\r\ncertain or substantially certain that such\r\ndistress would result from his conduct; (2)\r\nthe conduct was so extreme and outrageous as\r\nto exceed all possible bounds of decency and\r\nmust be regarded as atrocious, and utterly\r\nintolerable in a civilized community; (3) the\r\nactions of the defendant caused the\r\nplaintiff's emotional distress; and (4) the\r\nemotional distress suffered by the plaintiff\r\nwas severe so that no reasonable man could be\r\nexpected to endure it.\r\n\nColford v. Chubb Life Ins. Co., 687 A.2d 609, 616 (Me. 1996)\r\n(citations and internal quotations marks omitted), cert. denied,\r\n117 S. Ct. 2433 (1997).\r\nUnder Maine's jurisprudence, a court properly may\r\ndetermine, as a matter of law, whether undisputed (or assumed)\r\nfacts suffice to state a claim for intentional infliction of\r\nemotional distress.  See Gray v. State, 624 A.2d 479, 484 (Me.\r\n1993).  If those facts would not allow a rational factfinder to\r\nclassify the defendant's conduct as extreme or outrageous, or if\r\nany other element of the tort is lacking, then dismissal is proper.\r\nIn this instance, the amended complaint, read favorably\r\nto the appellant, falls short in two distinct respects.\r\nFirst, stripped of rhetorical flourishes, LaChapelle's\r\namended complaint alleges only the cessation of payments based upon\r\nwhat he characterizes as the Company's legally problematic\r\ninterpretation of the policy.  Although other factors   the\r\nappellant's depression, his fall from grace, and his incarceration\r\nlend color to this claim, they do not change its fundamental\r\nnature.  In fine, the pleaded facts reflect no harm independent of\r\nthe denial of benefits.\r\nMore is exigible.  Maine (unlike many other\r\njurisdictions) does not recognize a cause of action in tort for an\r\nunembellished bad-faith breach of an insurance policy.  Thus, when\r\na plaintiff premises a claim for intentional infliction of\r\nemotional distress on an insurer-insured relationship, the\r\nplaintiff-insured must demonstrate that the defendant-insurer\r\ncaused some harm apart from the withholding of the payments called\r\nfor by the policy.  See Colford, 687 A.2d at 616 (explaining that,\r\nto maintain such an action against a disability insurer, the\r\ninsured must demonstrate that the Company's actions \"arose\r\nindependently of its denial of the disability claim\"); see alsoMarquis v. Farm Family Mut. Ins. Co., 628 A.2d 644, 651 (Me. 1993)\r\n(explaining that the insured must show, for example, that the\r\nplaintiff \"suffered some accompanying physical injury, or, the\r\ncontract was such that a breach of it will result in a serious\r\nemotional disturbance\").  The appellant's amended complaint does\r\nnot clear this hurdle.\r\nSecond, the Company's conduct, even on the appellant's\r\nversion of it, cannot reasonably be construed as \"so 'extreme and\r\noutrageous' as to exceed all possible bounds of decency.\"  Colford,\r\n687 A.2d at 616.  To be sure, the pleaded facts show cold-\r\nheartedness and illustrate why indignant policyholders sometimes\r\nquestion the mores of the insurance industry.  But the scenario\r\nthat the amended complaint depicts, though unattractive, cannot\r\nfairly be said to reveal conduct that is atrocious, intolerable in\r\na civilized society, or sufficiently deplorable to trigger\r\nliability for emotional distress.  See id. at 617.  Nor could we\r\nsay straightfacedly that the Company, by ceasing to pay LaChapelle\r\nbenefits after his confinement, could be \"certain or substantially\r\ncertain\" that severe emotional distress would result from its\r\nactions.  See id. at 616.  There is thus no basis for a contention\r\nthat the Company \"recklessly\" or \"intentionally\" inflicted\r\nemotional distress.  Id.\r\nIn arguing for a contrary outcome, the appellant relies\r\nprincipally upon Borden v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., 935 F.2d 370\r\n(1st Cir. 1991).  His reliance is mislaid.  Borden stands for the\r\nproposition that, under Rhode Island law, a bad-faith breach of an\r\ninsurance contract, without more, may support a claim for\r\nintentional infliction of emotional distress.  Id. at 378.  Maine\r\nlaw, unlike Rhode Island law, does not allow a cause of action for\r\nintentional infliction of emotional distress to rest solely on a\r\nbad-faith breach of an insurance contract.  See Colford, 687 A.2d\r\nat 616; Marquis, 628 A.2d at 651.\r\n                           IV\r\nWe need go no further.  The doctrine of equitable tolling\r\nis inapplicable on these facts and the limitations period contained\r\nin the insurance policy therefore bars the appellant's breach of\r\ncontract claim.  Since the amended complaint fails to allege any\r\nother viable claim under Maine law, it follows inexorably, as night\r\nfollows day, that the lower court appropriately dismissed the suit.\r\n\nAffirmed.\n",

Maine Bonding &amp; Casualty Co., 404 A.2d 238, 241 (Me.1979), and that his forbearance was objectively reasonable, see Hanusek v. Southern Me.  Med. Ctr., 584 A.2d 634, 636-37 (Me.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant was on clear notice of his burden.  His original complaint in this case did not allege an estoppel, but he filed an amended complaint in an effort to correct that shortcoming.  Even then, he failed to sketch a factual predicate that would warrant the application of equitable estoppel.  For example, the appellant does not allege that he intended to sue during the prescriptive period.  More importantly, as evidence of conduct that ostensibly dissuaded him from taking timely legal action, the appellant mentions only the Company's statement to the effect that it might resume payments after his release.  As a matter of law, this assertion is insufficient to induce a reasonable person to sit on his rights.  See Townsend, 446 A.2d at 1134.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not belabor the obvious.  The Company did not mislead the appellant, but, rather, told him straightaway that it intended to stop paying benefits.  It then acted on that stated intention.  This should have been a reveille, not a lullaby.  By that we mean it should have galvanized a reasonable person into action, not lulled him into a false sense of security.  The Company's additional statement--that it \"might\" subsequently resume payments--conveyed no assurance and does not alter the relevant calculus.  In all events, even if the appellant relied on the Company's statement to his detriment, such reliance fails, as a matter of law, to meet the standard of objective reasonableness imposed under Maine law.  See Hanusek, 584 A.2d at 636-37;  City of Auburn v. Desgrosseilliers, 578 A.2d 712, 714 (Me.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LaChapelle parries by asserting that, given his fragile mental state, he could not be expected to appreciate and act upon the Company's volte-face.  Under certain circumstances, perhaps, the standard of objective reasonableness might yield to accommodate a plaintiff with severe mental disabilities (especially if those disabilities are known to the defendant).  But this is not such an instance.  Though the appellant suffered from depression, he was competent enough to bring his initial claim in a timely fashion, to mull (and promptly reject) the insurer's settlement proposal, and, three years later, to file another claim with the Company.  He does not allege that his condition worsened over time (indeed, at oral argument in this court, his counsel stated that it had not).  In short, there is nothing of record here that suggests a lack of capacity or a disability severe enough to warrant an exception to, or a relaxation of, the rule of objective reasonableness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant has one last arrow in his quiver.  In his reply brief in this court, he attempts to repair his ruptured breach of contract claim by arguing that, under the public policy of Maine as expressed in Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &#167; 853, his imprisonment tolled the limitations period.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The attempt fails.  For one thing, it seems fairly obvious that this statutory tolling provision does not apply to actions brought on insurance policies.  We need not resolve this point definitively, however, because the argument is procedurally defaulted.  It is settled beyond peradventure that \"absent the most extraordinary circumstances, legal theories not raised squarely in the lower court cannot be broached for the first time on appeal.\"  Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers Union, Local No. 59 v. Superline Transp. Co., 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir.1992);  see also Sandstrom v. ChemLawn Corp., 904 F.2d 83, 87 (1st Cir.1990) (explaining that an argument raised for the first time in a reply brief is procedurally infirm).  There is nothing about this case that counsels against enforcing this salutary principle.  Because the appellant failed to raise the statutory tolling argument in the court below, we will not entertain it here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have said enough on this score.  For aught that appears, the appellant simply neglected to bring suit against the Company in a timeous fashion.  On these facts, neither equitable estoppel nor any other tolling device is available to him.  Cf. Sandstrom, 904 F.2d at 87 (remarking that \"equity, after all, ministers to the vigilant, not to those who slumber upon their rights\").III</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves us with the appellant's tort claim.  To recover for intentional infliction of emotional distress in Maine, a plaintiff must show:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>(1) the defendant intentionally or recklessly inflicted severe emotional distress or was certain or substantially certain that such distress would result from his conduct;  (2) the conduct was so extreme and outrageous as to exceed all possible bounds of decency and must be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community;  (3) the actions of the defendant caused the plaintiff's emotional distress;  and (4) the emotional distress suffered by the plaintiff was severe so that no reasonable man could be expected to endure it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Colford v. Chubb Life Ins. Co., 687 A.2d 609, 616 (Me.1996) (citations and internal quotations marks omitted), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 2433, 138 L.Ed.2d 194 (1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Maine's jurisprudence, a court properly may determine, as a matter of law, whether undisputed (or assumed) facts suffice to state a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.  See Gray v. State, 624 A.2d 479, 484 (Me.1993).  If those facts would not allow a rational factfinder to classify the defendant's conduct as extreme or outrageous, or if any other element of the tort is lacking, then dismissal is proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the amended complaint, read favorably to the appellant, falls short in two distinct respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, stripped of rhetorical flourishes, LaChapelle's amended complaint alleges only the cessation of payments based upon what he characterizes as the Company's legally problematic interpretation of the policy.  Although other factors--the appellant's depression, his fall from grace, and his incarceration--lend color to this claim, they do not change its fundamental nature.  In fine, the pleaded facts reflect no harm independent of the denial of benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More is exigible.  Maine (unlike many other jurisdictions) does not recognize a cause of action in tort for an unembellished bad-faith breach of an insurance policy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Thus, when a plaintiff premises a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress on an insurer-insured relationship, the plaintiff-insured must demonstrate that the defendant-insurer caused some harm apart from the withholding of the payments called for by the policy.  See Colford, 687 A.2d at 616 (explaining that, to maintain such an action against a disability insurer, the insured must demonstrate that the Company's actions \"arose independently of its denial of the disability claim\");  see also Marquis v. Farm Family Mut. Ins. Co., 628 A.2d 644, 651 (Me.1993) (explaining that the insured must show, for example, that the plaintiff \"suffered some accompanying physical injury, or, the contract was such that a breach of it will result in a serious emotional disturbance\").  The appellant's amended complaint does not clear this hurdle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the Company's conduct, even on the appellant's version of it, cannot reasonably be construed as \"so 'extreme and outrageous' as to exceed all possible bounds of decency.\"  Colford, 687 A.2d at 616.   To be sure, the pleaded facts show cold-heartedness and illustrate why indignant policyholders sometimes question the mores of the insurance industry.  But the scenario that the amended complaint depicts, though unattractive, cannot fairly be said to reveal conduct that is atrocious, intolerable in a civilized society, or sufficiently deplorable to trigger liability for emotional distress.  See id. at 617.   Nor could we say straightfacedly that the Company, by ceasing to pay LaChapelle benefits after his confinement, could be \"certain or substantially certain\" that severe emotional distress would result from its actions.  See id. at 616.   There is thus no basis for a contention that the Company \"recklessly\" or \"intentionally\" inflicted emotional distress.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In arguing for a contrary outcome, the appellant relies principally upon Borden v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., 935 F.2d 370 (1st Cir.1991).  His reliance is mislaid.  Borden stands for the proposition that, under Rhode Island law, a bad-faith breach of an insurance contract, without more, may support a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.  Id. at 378.   Maine law, unlike Rhode Island law, does not allow a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress to rest solely on a bad-faith breach of an insurance contract.  See Colford, 687 A.2d at 616;  Marquis, 628 A.2d at 651.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  The doctrine of equitable tolling is inapplicable on these facts and the limitations period contained in the insurance policy therefore bars the appellant's breach of contract claim.  Since the amended complaint fails to allege any other viable claim under Maine law, it follows inexorably, as night follows day, that the lower court appropriately dismissed the suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We take no view as to the bona fides of this eccentric theory</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The complaint is silent as to whether LaChapelle had been released from prison by this time</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> This statute provides:</p>\n        <p>If a person entitled to bring any of the actions under [certain enumerated Maine statutes] is a minor, mentally ill, imprisoned or without the limits of the United States when the cause of action accrues, the action may be brought within the times limited herein after the disability is removed.</p>\n        <p>Me.Rev.Stat.

For the reasons elucidated below, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* The district court dismissed the appellant's suit on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.  Accordingly, we, like the trial court, must accept as true the well-pleaded factual allegations of the complaint, draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in the plaintiff's favor, and determine whether the complaint, so read, limns facts sufficient to justify recovery on any cognizable theory.  See Dartmouth Review v. Dartmouth College, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531870\"><a href=\"/opinion/531870/the-dartmouth-review-on-behalf-of-its-officers-staff-and-subscribers-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir.1989).  In arriving at this determination, we differentiate between well-pleaded facts, on the one hand, and \"bald assertions, unsupportable conclusions, periphrastic circumlocution, and the like,\" on the other hand;  the former must be credited, but the latter can safely be ignored.  See Aulson v. Blanchard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"717572\"><a href=\"/opinion/717572/alan-aulson-et-ux-maureen-aulson-v-charles-blanchard/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The operative pleading here is the amended complaint.  It alleges that the appellant, a stockbroker, obtained a policy of long-term disability insurance from the Company in 1986.  The insurance contract contained a standard clause, tracking Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 24-A, &#167; 2715 (West 1990), which required the insured to file written proof of any insured loss with the Company and to bring any legal action predicated on the policy within three years of the accrual date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 4, 1991, the appellant was found floating in the Androscoggin River and promptly hospitalized.  Doctors treated him for frostbite, hypothermia, and amnesia.  They also performed a psychiatric evaluation.  Following his discharge on February 8, 1991, the appellant admitted himself to another hospital because of his emotional difficulties.  He stayed there for less than two weeks.  Psychiatrists attributed his depression to severe stress, resulting from career troubles and pending legal proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant furnished written proof of loss to the Company, backed by medical evaluations declaring him to be totally disabled from performing his usual occupation.  The Company honored the claim and began paying benefits.  In due season, LaChapelle's legal bedevilment bore bitter fruit and he pled guilty to criminal charges of theft by misapplication of property.  The state court imposed an incarcerative sentence and imprisoned the appellant in June 1992.  That month, the Company informed him that it would discontinue payments (presumably on the theory that his immurement, not his depression, kept him from functioning as a stockbroker),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> but that it might resume payments after his release.  The Company also offered to settle all policy-related claims for $15,000.  The appellant refused the settlement offer but took no immediate action to contest the discontinuance of benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1995, the appellant filed another claim for disability benefits, asserting that he was still unable to work as a result of his original disability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The Company denied this claim and the appellant did not pursue it.  Two years later, however, he shifted his focus and sued the Company on the ground that it had breached the policy covenants by unilaterally terminating his benefits when he went to prison in 1992.  He appended supplemental claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress and violation of Maine's late payment of claims statute, Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit.  24-A, &#167; 2436(1) (West 1990), directed to the same event.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Company moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state an actionable claim.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).  After the appellant amended the complaint, the district court granted the Company's motion.  The court concluded that the breach of contract claim was time-barred by virtue of the insurance policy's internal three-year limitations period and that the facts alleged in the amended complaint were insufficient to ground an equitable estoppel.  The court also held that the amended complaint failed to state cognizable claims for either intentional infliction of emotional distress or the untimely payment of an insurance claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review de novo a district court's allowance of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.

Inasmuch as the appellant premised federal jurisdiction on diversity of citizenship and the existence of a controversy in the requisite amount, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a) (1994), we apply the substantive law of Maine.

Granting a motion to dismiss based on a limitations defense is entirely appropriate when the pleader's allegations leave no doubt that an asserted claim is time-barred.  See, e.g., Street v. Vose, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563222\"><a href=\"/opinion/563222/richard-a-street-v-george-vose-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span>, 39 (1st Cir.1991);  Kali Seafood, Inc. v.

Here, the appellant concedes that the three-year limitations period, if untolled, bars his contract claim.  He maintains, however, that the doctrine of equitable estoppel, correctly applied, halts the running of the limitations period and vitiates any temporally oriented defense.  The district court did not agree.  Nor do we.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Maine, \"the gist of an estoppel barring the defendant from invoking the defense of the statute of limitations is that the defendant has conducted himself in a manner which actually induces the plaintiff not to take timely legal action on a claim.\"  Townsend v. Appel, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2362392\"><a href=\"/opinion/2362392/townsend-v-appel/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1132</span></a></span>, 1134 (Me.1982).  Of course, the lack of a timely filing cannot be attributed to the defendant's conduct unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that he intended to file suit during the permitted period, see id., that the defendant's actions led him to refrain from doing so, see Roberts v. Maine Bonding &amp; Casualty Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2363637\"><a href=\"/opinion/2363637/roberts-v-maine-bonding-cas-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span>, 241 (Me.1979), and that his forbearance was objectively reasonable, see Hanusek v.

His original complaint in this case did not allege an estoppel, but he filed an amended complaint in an effort to correct that shortcoming.  Even then, he failed to sketch a factual predicate that would warrant the application of equitable estoppel.  For example, the appellant does not allege that he intended to sue during the prescriptive period.  More importantly, as evidence of conduct that ostensibly dissuaded him from taking timely legal action, the appellant mentions only the Company's statement to the effect that it might resume payments after his release.  As a matter of law, this assertion is insufficient to induce a reasonable person to sit on his rights.  See Townsend, 446 A.2d at 1134.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not belabor the obvious.  The Company did not mislead the appellant, but, rather, told him straightaway that it intended to stop paying benefits.  It then acted on that stated intention.  This should have been a reveille, not a lullaby.  By that we mean it should have galvanized a reasonable person into action, not lulled him into a false sense of security.  The Company's additional statement--that it \"might\" subsequently resume payments--conveyed no assurance and does not alter the relevant calculus.  In all events, even if the appellant relied on the Company's statement to his detriment, such reliance fails, as a matter of law, to meet the standard of objective reasonableness imposed under Maine law.  See Hanusek, 584 A.2d at 636-37;  City of Auburn v. Desgrosseilliers, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1973508\"><a href=\"/opinion/1973508/city-of-auburn-v-desgrosseilliers/\"><span class=\"volume\">578</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">712</span></a></span>, 714 (Me.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LaChapelle parries by asserting that, given his fragile mental state, he could not be expected to appreciate and act upon the Company's volte-face.  Under certain circumstances, perhaps, the standard of objective reasonableness might yield to accommodate a plaintiff with severe mental disabilities (especially if those disabilities are known to the defendant).  But this is not such an instance.  Though the appellant suffered from depression, he was competent enough to bring his initial claim in a timely fashion, to mull (and promptly reject) the insurer's settlement proposal, and, three years later, to file another claim with the Company.  He does not allege that his condition worsened over time (indeed, at oral argument in this court, his counsel stated that it had not).  In short, there is nothing of record here that suggests a lack of capacity or a disability severe enough to warrant an exception to, or a relaxation of, the rule of objective reasonableness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant has one last arrow in his quiver.  In his reply brief in this court, he attempts to repair his ruptured breach of contract claim by arguing that, under the public policy of Maine as expressed in Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &#167; 853, his imprisonment tolled the limitations period.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The attempt fails.  For one thing, it seems fairly obvious that this statutory tolling provision does not apply to actions brought on insurance policies.  We need not resolve this point definitively, however, because the argument is procedurally defaulted.  It is settled beyond peradventure that \"absent the most extraordinary circumstances, legal theories not raised squarely in the lower court cannot be broached for the first time on appeal.\"  Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers Union, Local No. 59 v. Superline Transp.

There is nothing about this case that counsels against enforcing this salutary principle.  Because the appellant failed to raise the statutory tolling argument in the court below, we will not entertain it here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have said enough on this score.  For aught that appears, the appellant simply neglected to bring suit against the Company in a timeous fashion.  On these facts, neither equitable estoppel nor any other tolling device is available to him.  Cf. Sandstrom, 904 F.2d at 87 (remarking that \"equity, after all, ministers to the vigilant, not to those who slumber upon their rights\").III</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves us with the appellant's tort claim.  To recover for intentional infliction of emotional distress in Maine, a plaintiff must show:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>(1) the defendant intentionally or recklessly inflicted severe emotional distress or was certain or substantially certain that such distress would result from his conduct;  (2) the conduct was so extreme and outrageous as to exceed all possible bounds of decency and must be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community;  (3) the actions of the defendant caused the plaintiff's emotional distress;  and (4) the emotional distress suffered by the plaintiff was severe so that no reasonable man could be expected to endure it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Colford v.

See Gray v. State, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1933125\"><a href=\"/opinion/1933125/gray-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">624</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">479</span></a></span>, 484 (Me.1993).  If those facts would not allow a rational factfinder to classify the defendant's conduct as extreme or outrageous, or if any other element of the tort is lacking, then dismissal is proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the amended complaint, read favorably to the appellant, falls short in two distinct respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, stripped of rhetorical flourishes, LaChapelle's amended complaint alleges only the cessation of payments based upon what he characterizes as the Company's legally problematic interpretation of the policy.  Although other factors--the appellant's depression, his fall from grace, and his incarceration--lend color to this claim, they do not change its fundamental nature.  In fine, the pleaded facts reflect no harm independent of the denial of benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More is exigible.  Maine (unlike many other jurisdictions) does not recognize a cause of action in tort for an unembellished bad-faith breach of an insurance policy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Thus, when a plaintiff premises a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress on an insurer-insured relationship, the plaintiff-insured must demonstrate that the defendant-insurer caused some harm apart from the withholding of the payments called for by the policy.  See Colford, 687 A.2d at 616 (explaining that, to maintain such an action against a disability insurer, the insured must demonstrate that the Company's actions \"arose independently of its denial of the disability claim\");  see also Marquis v. Farm Family Mut. Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1438920\"><a href=\"/opinion/1438920/marquis-v-farm-family-mut-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">628</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">644</span></a></span>, 651 (Me.1993) (explaining that the insured must show, for example, that the plaintiff \"suffered some accompanying physical injury, or, the contract was such that a breach of it will result in a serious emotional disturbance\").  The appellant's amended complaint does not clear this hurdle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the Company's conduct, even on the appellant's version of it, cannot reasonably be construed as \"so 'extreme and outrageous' as to exceed all possible bounds of decency.\"  Colford, 687 A.2d at 616.   To be sure, the pleaded facts show cold-heartedness and illustrate why indignant policyholders sometimes question the mores of the insurance industry.  But the scenario that the amended complaint depicts, though unattractive, cannot fairly be said to reveal conduct that is atrocious, intolerable in a civilized society, or sufficiently deplorable to trigger liability for emotional distress.  See id. at 617.   Nor could we say straightfacedly that the Company, by ceasing to pay LaChapelle benefits after his confinement, could be \"certain or substantially certain\" that severe emotional distress would result from its actions.  See id. at 616.   There is thus no basis for a contention that the Company \"recklessly\" or \"intentionally\" inflicted emotional distress.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In arguing for a contrary outcome, the appellant relies principally upon Borden v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"562609\"><a href=\"/opinion/562609/ronald-borden-v-the-paul-revere-life-insurance-company-ronald-borden-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">935</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1991).  His reliance is mislaid.  Borden stands for the proposition that, under Rhode Island law, a bad-faith breach of an insurance contract, without more, may support a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.  Id. at 378.   Maine law, unlike Rhode Island law, does not allow a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress to rest solely on a bad-faith breach of an insurance contract.  See Colford, 687 A.2d at 616;  Marquis, 628 A.2d at 651.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  The doctrine of equitable tolling is inapplicable on these facts and the limitations period contained in the insurance policy therefore bars the appellant's breach of contract claim.  Since the amended complaint fails to allege any other viable claim under Maine law, it follows inexorably, as night follows day, that the lower court appropriately dismissed the suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We take no view as to the bona fides of this eccentric theory</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The complaint is silent as to whether LaChapelle had been released from prison by this time</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> This statute provides:</p>\n        <p>If a person entitled to bring any of the actions under [certain enumerated Maine statutes] is a minor, mentally ill, imprisoned or without the limits of the United States when the cause of action accrues, the action may be brought within the times limited herein after the disability is removed.</p>\n        <p>Me.Rev.Stat.
