GAGLIARDI,\r\n\n                    Defendant, Appellant.\r\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n              FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n       [Hon. Reginald C. Lindsay, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n              Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   John P. Gagliardi on brief pro se.\r\n   Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, and Kevin P. McGrath,\r\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nJune 24, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  Pro se claimant John Gagliardi\r\n(Gagliardi) appeals a district court order that summarily\r\ndenied his post-conviction motion for the return of property\r\npursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(e).  In this case, the parties\r\nurge this court to decide an important question, i.e., whether\r\nan administrative declaration of forfeiture may survive a\r\ncollateral due process attack absent proof that the\r\nincarcerated property owner actually received a notice of the\r\nforfeiture that was sent to him, at his place of incarceration,\r\nby certified mail.  Two circuits have held that when the\r\ngovernment has commenced a forfeiture proceeding while the\r\nproperty owner is incarcerated on related drug charges, the\r\ngovernment must prove that it provided actual notice to the\r\nproperty owner or his criminal defense counsel in order for the\r\nforfeiture to survive such a collateral attack.  See, e.g.,\r\nWeng v. United States, 137 F.3d 709, 713-15 (2d Cir. 1998);\r\nUnited States v. Cupples, 112 F.3d 318, 320 (8th Cir. 1997); Bye\r\nv. United States, 105 F.3d 856, 857 (2d Cir. 1997)(per curiam);\r\nUnited States v. Woodall, 12 F.3d 791, 794-95 (8th Cir. 1993). \r\nIn contrast, two other circuits have held that the certified\r\nmailing of a forfeiture notice to the facility at which the\r\nproperty owner is incarcerated satisfies due process even if\r\nthe owner denies actual receipt.  See United States v. Clark,\r\n84 F.3d 378, 380-81 (10th Cir. 1996); United States v. Real\r\nProperty, 135 F.3d 1312, 1316 (9th Cir. 1998).  See also  United\r\nStates v. Small, 136 F.3d 1334, 1336 (D.C. Cir. 1998)(noting\r\nthat \"the Due Process Clause does not demand actual, successful\r\nnotice, but it does require a reasonable effort to give such\r\nnotice\").\r\n          We recognize that the Ninth Circuit has cited United\r\nStates v. One Urban Lot Located at One Street A-1, 885 F.2d\r\n994, 998 (1st Cir. 1989), and that the Second Circuit has cited\r\nUnited States v. Giraldo, 45 F.3d 509, 511 (1st Cir. 1995)(per\r\ncuriam), in support of their respective, opposing positions. \r\nBut both of these cases presented facts that differ\r\nsignificantly from those with which we are now confronted. \r\nIndeed, this court has never before confronted the precise\r\nissue presented here.  Nor do we think this an appropriate case\r\nin which to resolve it.  Thus, we conclude that, although the\r\ndistrict court should have acted more deliberately, the denial\r\nof relief was proper on this record for the reasons set forth\r\nbelow.\r\n                              I.\r\n          Gagliardi was convicted after pleading guilty to\r\nconspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana and\r\nrelated offenses, including a criminal forfeiture count.  Under\r\nthe terms of his plea agreement, Gagliardi agreed that the\r\namount that was subject to criminal forfeiture exceeded two\r\nmillion dollars and that all of his assets were forfeitable.\r\nNotwithstanding Gagliardi's guilty plea, the government did not\r\npursue an order of criminal forfeiture, apparently due to\r\nGagliardi's limited financial resources.\r\n          Five months after this court affirmed Gagliardi's\r\nconviction, Gagliardi filed a motion under Fed. R. Crim. P.\r\n41(e) seeking the return of approximately $2600 that was seized\r\nfrom him at his arrest.  The motion alleged that the money did\r\nnot constitute the proceeds of narcotics or other illicit\r\nactivity and lawfully belonged to Gagliardi.  Gagliardi also\r\nasserted that he was entitled to the equitable return of the\r\nmoney because he had never received notice of a forfeiture. \r\n          The government filed an opposition to Gagliardi's\r\nmotion which alleged that the district court lacked\r\njurisdiction because the money had been administratively\r\nforfeited after due notice to Gagliardi.  In support of its\r\nassertions, the government submitted a \"Computer Asset Program\r\nprintout\" which, according to the unsworn allegations of the\r\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, showed that a forfeiture notice had\r\nbeen sent to Gagliardi at the Plymouth County House of\r\nCorrections (PCHC) on December 12, 1994.  The government also\r\nsubmitted a copy of the DEA's Declaration of Forfeiture.  This\r\nsimply announced that the DEA had declared the money forfeited\r\non January 27, 1995, after notice had been issued in accordance\r\nwith 19 U.S.C.  1607 and  absent receipt of any claims to the\r\nfunds.\r\n          The government's opposition did not include any\r\nevidence which showed that the forfeiture notice mailed to\r\nGagliardi had been received by anyone.  Nor did it include\r\nproof that Gagliardi was indeed incarcerated at the PCHC when\r\nthe forfeiture notice was issued.  Nevertheless, before\r\nGagliardi had sufficient time to reply, the district court\r\nentered a margin order that summarily denied his Rule 41(e)\r\nmotion for the reasons stated in the government's opposition. \r\nThree days later, the court docketed Gagliardi's reply. \r\nTherein Gagliardi argued that the district court had\r\njurisdiction because the government had failed to prove that he\r\nhad received notice of the forfeiture, even though he did not\r\ndeny that he was incarcerated at the PCHC when the notice was\r\nsent there.  Gagliardi asked the district court either to\r\ndirect the government to prove that he personally received\r\nnotice of the forfeiture or to return the money to him.  One\r\nweek after filing that reply, Gagliardi filed a timely notice\r\nof appeal from the order denying his Rule 41(e) motion.\r\n          After Gagliardi filed his notice of appeal, but\r\nbefore his appeal was docketed in this court, the government\r\nsupplemented its opposition by filing an affidavit by Vicki L.\r\nRashid, Acting Forfeiture Counsel of the DEA, in the district\r\ncourt.  Attorney Rashid averred that, according to the DEA's\r\nfile, on December 12, 1994, the DEA sent written forfeiture\r\nnotices by certified mail to Gagliardi at the PCHC and at his\r\nformer home address (i.e, 102 Wellesley Street, Medford, MA). \r\nCopies of the forfeiture notices and the signed return receipts\r\nevincing delivery of same were attached to Rashid's affidavit. \r\nHowever, the return receipts showed that on December 24, 1994,\r\nsomeone other than Gagliardi signed for the notice that was\r\nsent to the PCHC.  On December 22, 1994, another unidentifiable\r\nindividual with the apparent last name of \"Gagliardi\" signed\r\nfor the forfeiture notice that was sent to Gagliardi's home. \r\nAttorney Rashid further averred that notices of the forfeiture\r\nand the procedures for filing a claim were published in USA\r\nToday on 12/21/94, 12/28/94, and 1/4/95 and that the DEA\r\ndeclared the money forfeited after the claim period expired\r\nwithout a response.  Gagliardi filed nothing in response to\r\nRashid's affidavit. \r\n                             II.\r\n          On appeal, Gagliardi argues that the district court\r\nerred by denying his motion before he had a chance to reply to\r\nthe government's opposition and that the order denying relief\r\nwas unwarranted because there is a genuine issue of material\r\nfact as to whether he actually received notice of the\r\nforfeiture.  In contrast, the government argues that its\r\nefforts to provide Gagliardi with notice satisfied due process\r\nand that any procedural error that the district court might\r\nhave made was harmless. \r\n          We agree that the district court erred procedurally.\r\nIt is well established that district courts have jurisdiction\r\nto review collateral due process attacks on administrative\r\nforfeitures.  Where criminal proceedings have concluded, a\r\ndistrict court should treat a Rule 41(e) motion that mounts\r\nsuch an attack as a civil complaint for equitable relief from\r\nthe forfeiture.   See, e.g., United States v. Marolf, 1999 WL\r\n198913 at *2, to be reported at 173 F.3d 1213,     (9th Cir.\r\n1999); Boero v. DEA, 111 F.3d 301, 303-05 &amp; n. 1 (2d Cir.\r\n1997); United States v. Rodgers, 108 F.3d 1247, 1250 &amp; n. 4\r\n(10th Cir. 1997); United States v. Giraldo, 45 F.3d at 511;\r\nUnited States v. Woodall, 12 F.3d at 793; United States v.\r\nMosquera, 845 F.2d 1122, 1126 (1st Cir. 1988)(per curiam); \r\nWillis v. United States, 787 F.2d 1089, 1092-93 (7th Cir.\r\n1986). \r\n          In a similar case, United States v. Mosquera, 845\r\nF.2d at 1125-26, this court held that the district court should\r\nnot have summarily denied a prisoner's post-conviction motion\r\nfor the return of property based only on the government's\r\nconclusory allegations that the prisoner received actual notice\r\nof the forfeiture, as evidenced by the fact that a petition for\r\nremission had been filed.  Here, the government's original\r\nopposition and supporting documents contained little more than\r\nthe sort of conclusory allegations held insufficient in\r\nMosquera.  Moreover, here, as in Mosquera, the district court\r\ndid not wait for Gagliardi to file a response to the\r\ngovernment's opposition before it denied relief.  This was\r\nerror.  See, e.g., Viqueira v. First Bank, 140 F.3d 12, 16-17\r\n(1st Cir. 1998)(citing Berrios v. Department of the Army, 884\r\nF.2d 28, 33 (1st Cir. 1989)(\"Where the defendant has challenged\r\nthe plaintiff's assertion of federal jurisdiction, under Rule\r\n12(b)(1), the court should give the plaintiff an opportunity to\r\npresent facts in support of his jurisdictional contention.\")). \r\nAt a minimum, the district court should have waited for the\r\ngovernment to supplement its opposition with proof of the\r\nnotice it alleged was sent to Gagliardi and for Gagliardi to\r\nhave a reasonable time to reply.  \r\n          Nevertheless, having carefully reviewed Gagliardi's\r\nreply to the government's opposition, as well as his brief on\r\nappeal, we conclude that this procedural error was harmless. \r\nEven if we were to assume that notice, by certified mail,\r\nadmittedly sent to and received at the institution at which the\r\nproperty owner was incarcerated, was constitutionally\r\ninadequate, Gagliardi is not entitled to relief on this record. \r\nIn the context of his plea agreement, Gagliardi has admitted\r\nthat all of his assets were forfeitable and that the total sum\r\nfor which he was liable exceeded two million dollars.  Apart\r\nfrom the alleged lack of notice, Gagliardi has utterly failed\r\nto state any grounds upon which he could contest this\r\nforfeiture on the merits.  Even the Second Circuit has upheld\r\na forfeiture under similar circumstances.  See Adames v. United\r\nStates, 171 F.3d 728, 732-33 (2d Cir. 1999)(affirming summary\r\njudgment for government despite fact that forfeiture was\r\npreceded by inadequate notice where claimant's plea allocution\r\nestablished currency's forfeitability).  See also United States\r\nv. Dennino, 103 F.3d 82, 85-86 (10th Cir. 1996)(upholding\r\nforfeiture despite alleged due process violation where claimant\r\nhad no basis to defeat forfeiture on the merits).  Gagliardi's\r\nprevious admissions, coupled with his failure to assert any\r\ngrounds upon which to attack the forfeiture on the merits,\r\npersuade us that to upset the forfeiture now and put the\r\ngovernment to its proof would be a useless exercise.  The\r\ngovernment need only refer to Gagliardi's plea agreement to\r\nprove the validity of the forfeiture.\r\n          Thus, to paraphrase the Tenth Circuit, \"[u]psetting\r\nthe forfeiture because of the alleged procedural faults, when\r\nMr. [Gagliardi] appears to have no basis for the return of the\r\nproperty once the faults are remedied in new proceedings, would\r\nserve no purpose other than to waste limited judicial\r\nresources.\" Dennino, 103 F.3d at 86.  We decline to require\r\nsuch a waste.  Thus, we conclude that the denial of relief was\r\nproper on this record, wholly apart from the notice issue that\r\nthe district court implicitly resolved in the government's\r\nfavor.  See Dennino, 103 F.3d at 85, n. 3 (court of appeals may\r\naffirm for any reason supported by the record).               \r\n          Affirmed.  See Local Rule 27.1.    \r\n",

On December 22, 1994, another unidentifiable\r\nindividual with the apparent last name of \"Gagliardi\" signed\r\nfor the forfeiture notice that was sent to Gagliardi's home. \r\nAttorney Rashid further averred that notices of the forfeiture\r\nand the procedures for filing a claim were published in USA\r\nToday on 12/21/94, 12/28/94, and 1/4/95 and that the DEA\r\ndeclared the money forfeited after the claim period expired\r\nwithout a response.  Gagliardi filed nothing in response to\r\nRashid's affidavit. \r\n                             II.\r\n          On appeal, Gagliardi argues that the district court\r\nerred by denying his motion before he had a chance to reply to\r\nthe government's opposition and that the order denying relief\r\nwas unwarranted because there is a genuine issue of material\r\nfact as to whether he actually received notice of the\r\nforfeiture.  In contrast, the government argues that its\r\nefforts to provide Gagliardi with notice satisfied due process\r\nand that any procedural error that the district court might\r\nhave made was harmless. \r\n          We agree that the district court erred procedurally.\r\nIt is well established that district courts have jurisdiction\r\nto review collateral due process attacks on administrative\r\nforfeitures.  Where criminal proceedings have concluded, a\r\ndistrict court should treat a Rule 41(e) motion that mounts\r\nsuch an attack as a civil complaint for equitable relief from\r\nthe forfeiture.

Mosquera, 845\r\nF.2d at 1125-26, this court held that the district court should\r\nnot have summarily denied a prisoner's post-conviction motion\r\nfor the return of property based only on the government's\r\nconclusory allegations that the prisoner received actual notice\r\nof the forfeiture, as evidenced by the fact that a petition for\r\nremission had been filed.  Here, the government's original\r\nopposition and supporting documents contained little more than\r\nthe sort of conclusory allegations held insufficient in\r\nMosquera.  Moreover, here, as in Mosquera, the district court\r\ndid not wait for Gagliardi to file a response to the\r\ngovernment's opposition before it denied relief.  This was\r\nerror.  See, e.g., Viqueira v. First Bank, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197886\"><a href=\"/opinion/197886/jamie-viqueira-v-first-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 16-17\r\n(1st Cir. 1998)(citing Berrios v.

Apart\r\nfrom the alleged lack of notice, Gagliardi has utterly failed\r\nto state any grounds upon which he could contest this\r\nforfeiture on the merits.  Even the Second Circuit has upheld\r\na forfeiture under similar circumstances.  See Adames v. United\r\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762611\"><a href=\"/opinion/762611/manuel-o-adames-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">728</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 732-33 (2d Cir. 1999)(affirming summary\r\njudgment for government despite fact that forfeiture was\r\npreceded by inadequate notice where claimant's plea allocution\r\nestablished currency's forfeitability).  See also United States\r\nv. Dennino, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"154300\"><a href=\"/opinion/154300/united-states-v-deninno/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">82</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 85-86 (10th Cir. 1996)(upholding\r\nforfeiture despite alleged due process violation where claimant\r\nhad no basis to defeat forfeiture on the merits).  Gagliardi's\r\nprevious admissions, coupled with his failure to assert any\r\ngrounds upon which to attack the forfeiture on the merits,\r\npersuade us that to upset the forfeiture now and put the\r\ngovernment to its proof would be a useless exercise.  The\r\ngovernment need only refer to Gagliardi's plea agreement to\r\nprove the validity of the forfeiture.\r\n          Thus, to paraphrase the Tenth Circuit, \"[u]psetting\r\nthe forfeiture because of the alleged procedural faults, when\r\nMr. [Gagliardi] appears to have no basis for the return of the\r\nproperty once the faults are remedied in new proceedings, would\r\nserve no purpose other than to waste limited judicial\r\nresources.\" Dennino, 103 F.3d at 86.  We decline to require\r\nsuch a waste.  Thus, we conclude that the denial of relief was\r\nproper on this record, wholly apart from the notice issue that\r\nthe district court implicitly resolved in the government's\r\nfavor.  See Dennino, 103 F.3d at 85, n. 3 (court of appeals may\r\naffirm for any reason supported by the record).               \r\n          Affirmed.  See Local Rule 27.1.    \r\n</pre>",
