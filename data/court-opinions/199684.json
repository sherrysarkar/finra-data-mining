Defendant-appellant Jose Diaz (“Diaz”) appeals\n\nhis   sentence    after   a     guilty       plea   on    the   ground    that   the\n\ngovernment breached its plea agreement by failing to recommend\n\nthat Diaz receive a three level reduction for acceptance of\n\nresponsibility under § 3E1.1 of the United States Sentencing\n\nGuidelines (“Guidelines”).           The government counters that it was\n\nnot bound by the plea agreement because Diaz violated its terms\n\nwhen he provided a false statement to Probation Services for\n\ninclusion in the presentence report.\n\n      It is well established that if a defendant fails to fulfill\n\nhis promises under a plea agreement, the government is released\n\nfrom its obligations under it.

The plea\n\nagreement here explicitly stated that it was binding on the\n\ngovernment only if Diaz pleaded guilty to the specified offenses\n\nand   “[d]id   not    engage    in   any     conduct      which   may    constitute\n\nobstruction      of   justice    under       §    3C1.1   of    the   guidelines.”\n\nObstruction      of   justice    under       §    3C1.1    includes      “providing\n\nmaterially false information to a probation officer in respect\n\nto a presentence report or other investigation for the court.”\n\n§ 3C1.1 comment.

By\n\nclaiming that he had used an air gun during the robbery, Diaz\n\ndenied an essential element of at least two of the offenses to\n\nwhich he pleaded guilty.     In addition to pleading guilty to\n\nconspiracy and armed   robbery charges, Diaz pleaded guilty to\n\nusing a “firearm” during and in relation to a crime of violence\n\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) and being a felon in possession of a\n\n“firearm” under 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(3)(A).
