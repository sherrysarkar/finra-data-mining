Curran, United States Attorney, Donald C.\nLockhart and Stephanie S. Browne, Assistant United States\nAttorneys, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                         February 12, 2001\n\n\n_________________\n\f*Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.\n\n\n\n\n             Per Curiam.     Arthur D'Amario, III, appeals his\n\n conviction and sentence for being a felon-in-possession of\n\n a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).                     We\n\n affirm.\n\n                                  I.\n\n             Debra Sellers (who dated D'Amario once or twice)\n\n obtained an abuse prevention order against D'Amario from a\n\n Massachusetts state court, on the ground that D'Amario was\n\n harassing    her.      Thereafter,    she   received   two    printed\n\n anonymous cards which she believed were sent by D'Amario.\n\n In February 1999, Attleboro, Massachusetts police obtained\n\n a search warrant for evidence that D'Amario had produced the\n\n cards, i.e., \"any typewriter, computer, word processor,\n\n printer,    typewriter    ribbons,    computer    ribbons,   computer\n\n discs, computer software, hard drive computer components or\n\n any other component or part of any instrument or machine\n\n capable of producing a printed document.\"\n\n             D'Amario lived in Smithfield, Rhode Island and the\n\n search was conducted by both Attleboro, Massachusetts and\n\n Smithfield,    Rhode   Island   police.     The    police    seized    a\n\n typewriter and ribbons and, thereafter, while searching in\n\fa dresser drawer, found a firearm and ammunition.                         One of\n\nthe officers knew at that time that D'Amario had previous\n\nconvictions in Rhode Island and Massachusetts and that at\n\nleast one of those convictions resulted in a sentence longer\n\nthan   one     year.         The    officers     seized     the    firearm      and\n\nammunition.\n\n             At       the   time    of    this   search,    D'Amario      was    on\n\nprobation      from     both      the     Massachusetts    and    Rhode   Island\n\nconvictions and he was arrested a few days after the search\n\nand held on Rhode Island state charges of violating his\n\nprobation.        Eventually, he was charged in federal court with\n\nbeing a felon-in-possession, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §\n\n922(g)(1).        D'Amario and the government stipulated that (1)\n\nhe had a prior felony conviction; (2) the weapon met the\n\ndefinition of a firearm; and (3) the gun had traveled in\n\ninterstate commerce prior to his possession.                       Nonetheless,\n\nD'Amario went to trial before a jury.                        In essence, he\n\napparently        hoped     for    jury    nullification.         Although      the\n\nelement of \"knowing possession\" of the firearm meant that\n\nthe government only had to prove that D'Amario knew that the\n\nweapon   was      a    firearm      and    voluntarily     and    intentionally\n\npossessed it -- something that D'Amario did not contest --\n\nD'Amario     sought         to    show    that   the   firearm     was    legally\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fpurchased in 1987, i.e., before his felony conviction, and\n\nthat he thereafter simply failed to dispose of it.\n\n         D'Amario was convicted and sentenced to 18 months.\n\nThe sentence reflected a downward departure of one level,\n\ngiving consideration to the fact that D'Amario's possession\n\nof a weapon, unloaded, in a drawer for twelve years appeared\n\nto have been passive, i.e., there was no indication that\n\nD'Amario had ever used or brandished the gun.\n\n\n\n\n                            -4-\n\f                                II.\n\n            We discuss D'Amario's appellate issues in the same\n\norder in which he has presented them.\n\n1. Entitlement to judgment of acquittal\n\n            Whether or not, for purposes of precluding the\n\npossession of firearms, Rhode Island law makes a distinction\n\nbetween    felons   convicted   of    violent    versus       nonviolent\n\nfelonies is irrelevant.    Section 922(g)(1), which prohibits\n\npreviously convicted felons from possessing a firearm, makes\n\nno such distinction between defendants convicted of violent\n\nversus     nonviolent   felonies.        See     United       States   v.\n\nChamberlain, 159 F.3d 656, 660 (1st Cir. 1998); United\n\nStates v. Tavares, 21 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1994) (en banc).\n\nThe government did not need to prove that D'Amario knowingly\n\nviolated the law; it only needed to prove that D'Amario\n\nknowingly possessed the firearm, which D'Amario effectively\n\nconceded in his testimony.      See United States v. Smith, 940\n\nF.2d 710, 713 (1st Cir. 1991).        Moreover, we have previously\n\nrejected a theory of defense in a § 922(g)(1) prosecution\n\nbased on a defendant's claim that he had not been advised\n\nthat he could not possess firearms under federal law and\n\nbelieved     that   a   state's       issuance     of     a     Firearms\n\nIdentification card, allowing the possession of a firearm\n\n\n                                -5-\n\funder state law, gave him the right to possess firearms.\n\nSee United States v. Caron, 64 F.3d 713, 714-17 (1st Cir.\n\n1995), cert. denied, 518 U.S. 1027 (1996).\n\n\n\n\n                           -6-\n\f2. Request for a continuance\n\n           There was no abuse of discretion, much less \"a\n\nmanifest   abuse     of     discretion,\"       in    the   district        court's\n\ndenial of D'Amario's request for a continuance.                       See United\n\nStates v. Orlando-Figueroa, 229 F.3d 33, 39 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(reciting standard).          The request was tardily filed and no\n\nissue    regarding     a    continuance    was       even    mentioned           when\n\nD'Amario   had   the       opportunity    to    do    so    at    a   telephonic\n\nconference held the week before trial.\n\n3. The competency examination\n\n           D'Amario's        complaints    regarding         the      competency\n\nexamination appear baseless as well as moot.                     Moreover, this\n\ncourt has already reviewed and rejected these complaints.\n\nSee In re D'Amario, No. 99-1724 (1st Cir. July 23, 1999).\n\n4. Jury instructions\n\n           By failing to reassert his objection after the\n\ninstructions were given, D'Amario has waived consideration\n\nof it.    See United States v. Mendoza-Acevedo, 950 F.2d 1, 4\n\n(1st Cir. 1991).           And, there was no plain error in the\n\ncourt's refusal to instruct the jury as requested.                         Contrary\n\nto his contention, the Ninth Circuit, in fact, has rejected\n\nthe assertions proffered by D'Amario with respect to the\n\ninterstate   transportation        of     firearms,         both      as    to    the\n\n                                   -7-\n\frequirement that the movement have \"recently\" occurred and\n\nthe subsumed assertion that the issue of time is a jury\n\nquestion.    See United States v. Casterline, 103 F.3d 76, 77\n\n(9th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 835 (1997).\n\n5. The motion to suppress\n\n            D'Amario   reasserts     his   contentions   that   the\n\nevidence of the gun should have been suppressed because the\n\nsearch warrant lacked probable cause and the gun was outside\n\nthe scope of the warrant.      We review, de novo, a district\n\ncourt's determination that a given set of facts constituted\n\nprobable cause, but defer to the court's findings of fact,\n\nunless clearly erroneous.    See United States v. Charles, 213\n\nF.3d 10, 18 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 121 S. Ct. 272 (2000).\n\nUpon our review, we find no error in the district court's\n\ndenial of D'Amario's motion to suppress.       We need say little\n\nbeyond that said by the district court in its order of\n\nNovember 3, 1999.      The so-called \"Catlow report\" does not\n\ncontradict Sergeant Collins's statements of what he knew at\n\nthe time of the search and does not warrant overturning the\n\ndistrict court's refusal to reopen the suppression matter on\n\nthe basis of that report.\n\n6. Sentencing\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\f              A district court is not authorized to award credit\n\nat sentencing; it is the Attorney General who computes the\n\namount   of    credit   after   a   defendant   begins   his   federal\n\nsentence.      See United States v. Wilson, 503 U.S. 329 (1992).\n\nD'Amario's course of relief is to exhaust administrative\n\nremedies with the Bureau of Prisons and, if dissatisfied, to\n\nseek judicial review pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241.              See id.\n\nat 335; Rogers v. United States, 180 F.3d 349, 357-58 (1st\n\nCir. 1999), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 958 (2000).               Contrary\n\nto D'Amario's assertion, United States v. Benefield, 942\n\nF.2d 60 (1st Cir. 1991), is not a \"virtually identical\n\nsituation,\" and, in any event, the Sixth Circuit opinion,\n\nupon which we relied, was subsequently reversed in Wilson.\n\nD'Amario's suggestion that his counsel was ineffective in\n\nnot getting his state sentence imposed prior to the federal\n\nsentencing is no more than a passing reference, was not\n\npresented      below,    and    would     require   further    factual\n\nexposition.      As such, it is not sufficiently developed for\n\nconsideration on this direct appeal.            See United States v.\n\nMartinez-Martinez, 69 F.3d 1215, 1225 (1st Cir. 1995), cert.\n\ndenied, 517 U.S. 1115 (1996).\n\n              D'Amario argues error by the district court in\n\ndenying his request for a two level downward adjustment for\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\facceptance     of   responsibility.         Contrary         to   D'Amario's\n\ncontention, however, the district court did not erroneously\n\nbelieve that D'Amario was ineligible for such a reduction\n\nbecause he elected to go to trial.               Rather, it is evident\n\nthat the court did not find this to be one of the \"'rare\n\nsituations' [in which] a defendant may elect to exercise his\n\nright to trial and still be eligible for a reduction\" for\n\nacceptance of responsibility.           United States v. Ellis, 168\n\nF.3d 558, 564 (1st Cir. 1999) (quoting U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1,\n\napplication (n.2)).        We review the district court's refusal\n\nto   award     a    downward       adjustment     for        acceptance    of\n\nresponsibility      for    clear   error.       See   United      States   v.\n\nCarrington, 96 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 520\n\nU.S. 1150 (1997).         D'Amario has not met that burden.\n\n7. Allegedly \"newly available\" evidence\n\n             This claim, presented in cursory fashion, in any\n\nevent, is not properly before this court.               See United States\n\nv. Graciani, 61 F.3d 70, 77 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n                                    III.\n\n             While this appeal has been pending, D'Amario has\n\nfiled   several     miscellaneous      motions.         In    light   of   our\n\ndisposition of this appeal, we deny the motions for release\n\n\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fpending appeal and for summary reversal.    We also deny, as\n\nmoot, the motion to expedite this appeal.\n\n         The conviction and the sentence are affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                           -11-\n\f",

Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"565998\"><a href=\"/opinion/565998/united-states-v-edward-t-smith-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">940</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">710</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 713 (1st Cir. 1991).        Moreover, we have previously\n\nrejected a theory of defense in a § 922(g)(1) prosecution\n\nbased on a defendant's claim that he had not been advised\n\nthat he could not possess firearms under federal law and\n\nbelieved     that   a   state's       issuance     of     a     Firearms\n\nIdentification card, allowing the possession of a firearm\n\n\n                                -5-\n\funder state law, gave him the right to possess firearms.\n\nSee United States v.

Request for a continuance\n\n           There was no abuse of discretion, much less \"a\n\nmanifest   abuse     of     discretion,\"       in    the   district        court's\n\ndenial of D'Amario's request for a continuance.                       See United\n\nStates v.

The request was tardily filed and no\n\nissue    regarding     a    continuance    was       even    mentioned           when\n\nD'Amario   had   the       opportunity    to    do    so    at    a   telephonic\n\nconference held the week before trial.\n\n3. The competency examination\n\n           D'Amario's        complaints    regarding         the      competency\n\nexamination appear baseless as well as moot.                     Moreover, this\n\ncourt has already reviewed and rejected these complaints.\n\nSee In re D'Amario, No. 99-1724 (1st Cir. July 23, 1999).\n\n4. Jury instructions\n\n           By failing to reassert his objection after the\n\ninstructions were given, D'Amario has waived consideration\n\nof it.    See United States v. Mendoza-Acevedo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572650\"><a href=\"/opinion/572650/united-states-v-edilberto-mendoza-acevedo/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 4\n\n(1st Cir. 1991).           And, there was no plain error in the\n\ncourt's refusal to instruct the jury as requested.                         Contrary\n\nto his contention, the Ninth Circuit, in fact, has rejected\n\nthe assertions proffered by D'Amario with respect to the\n\ninterstate   transportation        of     firearms,         both      as    to    the\n\n                                   -7-\n\frequirement that the movement have \"recently\" occurred and\n\nthe subsumed assertion that the issue of time is a jury\n\nquestion.

The motion to suppress\n\n            D'Amario   reasserts     his   contentions   that   the\n\nevidence of the gun should have been suppressed because the\n\nsearch warrant lacked probable cause and the gun was outside\n\nthe scope of the warrant.      We review, de novo, a district\n\ncourt's determination that a given set of facts constituted\n\nprobable cause, but defer to the court's findings of fact,\n\nunless clearly erroneous.    See United States v. Charles, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198941\"><a href=\"/opinion/198941/united-states-v-charles/\"><span class=\"volume\">213</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 18 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000).\n\nUpon our review, we find no error in the district court's\n\ndenial of D'Amario's motion to suppress.       We need say little\n\nbeyond that said by the district court in its order of\n\nNovember 3, 1999.      The so-called \"Catlow report\" does not\n\ncontradict Sergeant Collins's statements of what he knew at\n\nthe time of the search and does not warrant overturning the\n\ndistrict court's refusal to reopen the suppression matter on\n\nthe basis of that report.\n\n6. Sentencing\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\f              A district court is not authorized to award credit\n\nat sentencing; it is the Attorney General who computes the\n\namount   of    credit   after   a   defendant   begins   his   federal\n\nsentence.      See United States v.

As such, it is not sufficiently developed for\n\nconsideration on this direct appeal.

Contrary         to   D'Amario's\n\ncontention, however, the district court did not erroneously\n\nbelieve that D'Amario was ineligible for such a reduction\n\nbecause he elected to go to trial.               Rather, it is evident\n\nthat the court did not find this to be one of the \"'rare\n\nsituations' [in which] a defendant may elect to exercise his\n\nright to trial and still be eligible for a reduction\" for\n\nacceptance of responsibility.
