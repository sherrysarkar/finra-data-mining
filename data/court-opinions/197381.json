See United States  v.

On  remand the  district court\r\n\nfound  that Tavares had committed an assault with a dangerous\r\n\nweapon  and the  intent  to do  bodily harm,  as well  as the\r\n\nintent to  commit another felony.1  The  court concluded that\r                                             1\r\n\nTavares  was  subject  to  sentencing  under  the  aggravated\r\n\nassault guideline as a  result of these findings.

Tavares again appeals,\r                       \r\n\ncontending  that the  court clearly  erred by  sentencing him\r\n\nunder  the  aggravated  assault guideline  and  by  departing\r\n\nupward  to  sentence him  to  120  months' imprisonment,  the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1The aggravated assault  guideline applies to  a felonious\r               1\r\nassault involving (a) a  dangerous weapon with the intent  to\r\ndo bodily harm (i.e., not merely to frighten), or (b) serious\r\nbodily injury, or  (c) an  intent to  commit another  felony.\r\nSee U.S.S.G.  2A2.2, comment.

The other felony found\r               \r\nhere was  the malicious destruction of  property in violation\r\nof M.G.L. c. 266,   127. \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nmaximum that may  be imposed  on the  offense of  conviction.\r\n\nSee 18 U.S.C.   924(a)(2).\r               \r\n\n     On this record,  we cannot say that  the court's finding\r\n\nthat  Tavares  committed an  assault  with the  intent  to do\r\n\nbodily  harm was  clearly erroneous.   See  United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nGarcia, 34 F.3d  6, 10  (1st Cir.  1994).   This finding  was\r                  \r\n\nalone  sufficient to  support application  of the  aggravated\r\n\nassault guideline.2 Similarly, the district court did not err\r                              2\r\n\nby adding the five  level discharge adjustment under U.S.S.G.\r\n\n 2A2.2(b)(2)(A).   The  court  found that  Tavares fired  his\r\n\nweapon as  part of the overall assault on Blake and Hunt.  As\r\n\nthe  evidence indicates  that  the  assailants'  conduct  was\r\n\nprompted by  their prior altercation with  these individuals,\r\n\nthis finding was  not clearly erroneous.   Thus, the addition\r\n\nof  the  discharge  adjustment  was  proper.    See  U.S.S.G.\r                                                               \r\n\n 1B1.3(a)(1)(authorizing   addition   of   specific   offense\r\n\ncharacteristics based  on \"all acts ...  committed during the\r\n\ncommission of the offense of conviction\").3\r                                                      3\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   2We need  not decide whether, as  the government contends,\r               2\r\nan  intent to  commit  a felony  in  violation of  state  law\r\nsatisfies  2A2.2, comment., n. 1.\r\n\n   3Tavares also asks this court to rule that Hunt suffered a\r               3\r\nminor  injury as  a matter of  law and to  vacate the 3-level\r\nadjustment imposed under  2A2.2(b)(3)(D).  We have previously\r\nruled that the severity of Hunt's injury cannot be decided as\r\na  matter of law.  See  93 F.3d at 16.   The district court's\r                                  \r\ndetermination that Hunt suffered  something between a \"bodily\r\ninjury\"  and  a  \"serious  bodily  injury\"  was  not  clearly\r\nerroneous. \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n     Finally, we  again conclude that the  district court did\r\n\nnot abuse its discretion in making the upward departure here.\r\n\n Tavares' criminal  record, which included  evidence that  he\r\n\nhad committed the three violent offenses that had resulted in\r\n\nthe \"guilty filed\" dispositions,  was serious and  egregious.\r\n\nThe  wantonness of the offense of  conviction  also justified\r\n\nthe departure.   See United  States v. Hardy,  99 F.3d  1242,\r                                                        \r\n\n1248-52 (1st Cir.  1996)(upholding upward departure based  on\r\n\ndefendant's  repeatedly  discharging  and   discarding  semi-\r\n\nautomatic  weapon  in  residential  area);  United  States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nCroom,  50 F.3d 433, 435 (7th Cir. 1995)(\"Meeting most of the\r                 \r\n\ncriteria for designation as an armed career criminal ... does\r\n\nnot  permit the  judge to impose  the penalties  designed for\r\n\nthose who  meet all  of the  criteria, but  it does  permit a\r\n\ndeparture   in   the   direction   of   those   penalties.\").\r                                            \r\n\nAccordingly, the judgment of  the district court is affirmed.\r                                                                        \r\n\nTavares' motion for bail pending appeal is moot.\r                                                           \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
