Pigott's\r\n\ncomplaint  sought  monetary   damages  and  declaratory   and\r\n\ninjunctive relief on the grounds that the defendants violated\r\n\nhis constitutional rights by falsifying the trial transcripts\r\n\nessential for Pigott's direct appeal and obstructing Pigott's\r\n\nefforts to correct those transcripts. \r\n\n     We have thoroughly reviewed  the record and the parties'\r\n\nbriefs  on appeal.

That memorandum incorrectly asserted that Pigott's claim that he was deprived of his right to appeal was meritless because Pigott's direct appeal was then pending.  As the defendants have waived this argument on appeal, we do not rely on it</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We note that Pigott presently has a federal habeas action pending in the district court and an appeal from the denial of his motion for a new trial pending in the Massachusetts Appeals Court.  Both actions raise the same claims that Pigott has asserted here</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Pigott also contends that defendant Leary maintained a policy of deliberate indifference to the rights of pro se litigants that resulted in the loss of his direct appeal and numerous violations of the rights of other pro se prisoners.  To the extent Pigott seeks relief for the loss of his appeal, this claim is barred by Heck.  Pigott has no standing to pursue claims on behalf of other prisoners</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
