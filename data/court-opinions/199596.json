  "plain_text": "      [NOT FOR PUBLICATIONâ€“NOT TO BE CITED AS PRECEDENT]\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                     For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 00-2044\n\n                    GEORGE R. JORDAN, JR.,\n\n                    Petitioner, Appellant,\n\n                              v.\n\n               COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE,\n\n                     Respondent, Appellee.\n\n\n              APPEAL FROM THE ORDERS OF DISMISSAL\n\n         AND DECISIONS OF THE UNITED STATES TAX COURT\n\n       [Hon. Arthur L. Nims, III, U.S. Tax Court Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                   Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n          Campbell and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     George R. Jordan, Jr. on brief pro se.\n     Claire Fallon, Acting Assistant Attorney General, David I.\nPincus and Laurie Snyder, Attorneys, Tax Division, Department of\nJustice, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                      September 10, 2001\n\f           Per Curiam.   After appellant repeatedly failed to\n\nproceed as provided by Tax Court Rule 91(a), filed non-\n\nresponsive and evasive replies to orders to show cause, and\n\nfailed to appear on the scheduled trial date, the court\n\ndismissed his petitions for redetermination of deficiencies\n\nand additions to the tax, and entered default judgments\n\nagainst him on those issues as to which respondent bore the\n\nburden of proof including fraud penalties.           Upon review of\n\nthe record, we perceive no support for appellant's garbled\n\narguments that the court abused its discretion, violated due\n\nprocess,   or   committed   any    other    error.         Appellant's\n\ncontested motion for a continuance was filed just twenty\n\ndays   before   the    scheduled   trial     date    and     contained\n\ntransparently insufficient excuses for his multiple failures\n\nto cooperate in the pretrial process.           The filing of the\n\nmotion for a continuance did not excuse appellant's failure\n\nto appear on the scheduled date.           See Tax Court Rules 33,\n\n123.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\f",
