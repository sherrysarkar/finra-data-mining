Finding  no error, we affirm the district court judgment in\r\n\nall respects. \r\n\n          Negron  first claims that  the district court  erred in\r\n\nrejecting his  motion  for a  bill  of particulars,  because  the\r\n\nindictment failed to name all coconspirators and alleged no overt\r\n\nacts involving Negron.1  The lone count against Negron alleged an\r\n\neighteen-month conspiracy  to possess  with intent  to distribute\r\n\ncocaine.   It named all  28 indicted coconspirators,  but omitted\r\n\ntwo unindicted cooperating  witnesses.2  No more was exigible, as\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Rulings disallowing bills of  particulars are reviewed only\r\nfor abuse  of discretion.

There is no basis  for concluding\r                     \r\n\nthat this indictment was impermissibly vague, so as to materially\r\n\nhamper  trial preparation, cause surprise, or prevent Negron from\r\n\nforfending against  double jeopardy.   Moreover, not only  did he\r\n\nhave  the  benefit  of full  discovery,  but  the district  court\r\n\nordered that  Negron be  accorded reasonable access  to the  four\r\n\ncooperating witnesses who  later testified for the  government at\r\n\ntrial.    These  discovery  resources  afforded  Negron  adequate\r\n\nopportunities  to inform himself  of the evidence  the government\r\n\nwas prepared to present at trial.  Negron has  neither provided a\r\n\nfactual  foundation for his  conclusory alibi-defense  claim, nor\r\n\nindicated a basis for the claim that any vagueness in the present\r\n\nindictment may expose him to  prosecution for conduct of which he\r\n\nhas been acquitted  in the past.   See United States  v. Ramirez-\r                                                                           \r\n\nBurgos, 44 F.3d  17, 19 (1st Cir. 1995)(citations  omitted) (\"The\r                \r\n\nDouble Jeopardy Clause  safeguards against (i) a  second prosecu-\r\n\ntion following acquittal or final conviction for the same offense\r\n\nand (ii)  multiple punishments  for the  same offense.\");  United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.

Finally, even though  Negron has\r\n\nbeen apprised of the relevant times, transactions and persons, he\r\n\nneither  precisely defines  an alibi  nor  demonstrates that  the\r\n\npresent  conspiracy  charge  is barred  by  any  prior acquittal.\r\n\nMoreover, since  the indictment contained  sufficient information\r\n\nto  apprise Negron  of the  criminal  conduct with  which he  was\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\ncharged,  he was  neither prejudiced  nor  unfairly surprised  at\r\n\ntrial by any absence of particulars. \r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\n          Negron also claims that  the evidence was  insufficient\r\n\nto support the verdict.3  At trial, the government presented four\r\n\ncoconspirators, each  of whom  tied Negron  directly to the  same\r\n\nconspiracy.  Their  credibility was for the jury.   United States\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Saccoccia, 58 F.3d 754, 773 (1st Cir. 1995).   \r                      \r\n\n          Negron  further claims that the district court erred in\r\n\ndenying  his motion  for  new  trial  based  on  newly-discovered\r\n\nevidence.  The  proffered \"newly discovered evidence\"     a puta-\r\n\ntive  averment by  a  cooperating  witness  that Negron  did  not\r\n\nparticipate in  the drug organization     fell well short  of the\r\n\nmark, if for  no other reason than that it has  not been shown to\r\n\nhave been \"newly discovered.\"   See United States v. Natanel, 938\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d  302, 313  (1st  Cir.  1991), cert.  denied,  502 U.S.  1079\r                                                          \r\n\n(1992);  see also  United  States  v.

As there  was evidence that Negron\r\n\nhad been involved with considerably more than the five  kilograms\r\n\nof  cocaine found by  the district court, there  can have been no\r\n\nclear error.   See United States v. Morillo, 8 F.3d 864, 871 (1st\r                                                     \r\n\nCir. 1993).\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3We review the entire record  in the light most favorable to\r\nthe government and indulge all reasonable inferences favorable to\r\nthe verdict,  see United  States v.

There is no basis  for concluding\r                     \r\n\nthat this indictment was impermissibly vague, so as to materially\r\n\nhamper  trial preparation, cause surprise, or prevent Negron from\r\n\nforfending against  double jeopardy.   Moreover, not only  did he\r\n\nhave  the  benefit  of full  discovery,  but  the district  court\r\n\nordered that  Negron be  accorded reasonable access  to the  four\r\n\ncooperating witnesses who  later testified for the  government at\r\n\ntrial.    These  discovery  resources  afforded  Negron  adequate\r\n\nopportunities  to inform himself  of the evidence  the government\r\n\nwas prepared to present at trial.  Negron has  neither provided a\r\n\nfactual  foundation for his  conclusory alibi-defense  claim, nor\r\n\nindicated a basis for the claim that any vagueness in the present\r\n\nindictment may expose him to  prosecution for conduct of which he\r\n\nhas been acquitted  in the past.

Finally, even though  Negron has\r\n\nbeen apprised of the relevant times, transactions and persons, he\r\n\nneither  precisely defines  an alibi  nor  demonstrates that  the\r\n\npresent  conspiracy  charge  is barred  by  any  prior acquittal.\r\n\nMoreover, since  the indictment contained  sufficient information\r\n\nto  apprise Negron  of the  criminal  conduct with  which he  was\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\ncharged,  he was  neither prejudiced  nor  unfairly surprised  at\r\n\ntrial by any absence of particulars. \r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\n          Negron also claims that  the evidence was  insufficient\r\n\nto support the verdict.3  At trial, the government presented four\r\n\ncoconspirators, each  of whom  tied Negron  directly to the  same\r\n\nconspiracy.
