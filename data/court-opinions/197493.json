Martin Fernandez pled guilty\r\n\nto an unarmed bank robbery charge in February of 1996.    See 18\r\n\nU.S.C. S 2133(a). The district judge (Young, J.), confronted with\r\n\nFernandez' criminal history, found him to be a career offender and\r\n\nsentenced him accordingly.  See U.S.S.G. S 4B1.1.\r\n\n          On appeal Fernandez challenges his sentence, arguing that\r\n\nhe did not qualify as a career offender under the sentencing\r\n\nguidelines. He says the district court's contrary finding was\r\n\nlegally incorrect for at least two reasons: (1) the district judge\r\n\nerred when he concluded that the Massachusetts crime of assault and\r\n\nbattery on a police officer (one of Fernandez' predicate offenses)\r\n\nis, categorically, a crime of violence within the meaning of\r\n\nU.S.S.G. S 4B1.1; and (2) the district judge's alternate finding\r\n\n(that the facts underlying Fernandez' offense establish it as a\r\n\ncrime of violence) was based on an impermissible judicial inquiry\r\n\ninto the discrete circumstances of his offense conduct.\r\n\n          Because we conclude that the Massachusetts crime of\r\n\nassault and battery on a police officer is, categorically, a crime\r\n\nof violence within the meaning of U.S.S.G. S 4B1.1, we need not\r\n\naddress Fernandez' contention that the trial judge's factual\r\n\ninquiry was inconsistent with the mandate of    Taylor v.  United\r\n\nStates, 495 U.S. 575 (1990), and we affirm the sentence.\r\n\n                           Background\r\n\n          Fernandez' career offender status rested on two\r\n\nunderlying state convictions: assault and battery by means of a\r\n\ndangerous weapon and assault and battery upon a police officer.\r\n\nFernandez did not object to classification of the former as a\r\r\n\n\"crime of violence\" within the meaning of U.S.S.G. S 4B1.1. He\r\n\ndid, however, object to consideration of his prior assault and\r\n\nbattery upon a police officer as a \"crime of violence.\" The\r\n\ndistrict judge overruled Fernandez' objections, determined that he\r\n\nwas indeed a career offender, and sentenced him at the low end of\r\n\nthe applicable guideline range.\r\n\n          On appeal, Fernandez argues that because, under\r\n\nMassachusetts law, the crime of assault and battery upon a police\r\n\nofficer can include both violent and non-violent variants, the\r\n\ndistrict judge erred when he classified the offense as one of\r\n\nviolence within the meaning of the career offender provisions of\r\n\nthe guidelines. Fernandez' guideline sentencing range would have\r\n\nbeen more favorable to him if the offense had not been so\r\n\nclassified.\r\n\n                           Discussion\r\n\n          Whether Fernandez' prior conviction for assaulting a\r\n\npolice officer is properly deemed a predicate \"crime of violence\"\r\n\nunder U.S.S.G. S 4B1.1 is a question of law, which we review   de\r\n\nnovo. See \r                    United States\r                                  v. \r                                     Winter, 22 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\n\n          For purposes of the career offender provisions, the\r\n\nsentencing guidelines define \"crime of violence\" as:\r\n\n     (1)  [A]ny offense under federal or state law\r\n          punishable by imprisonment for a term\r\n          exceeding one year that --\r\n\n          (i) has as an element the use, attempted use,\r\n          or threatened use of physical force against\r\n          the person of another, or\r\n\n          (ii) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or\r\n          extortion, involves use of explosives,     or\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n          otherwise  \r                              involves  \r                                        conduct  \r                                                that  \r                                                      presents  \r                                                                a\r\n          serious \r                            potential \r                                      risk \r                                           of \r                                              physical \r                                                       injury \r                                                               to\r\n          another.\r\n\nU.S.S.G. S 4B1.2 (November 1, 1995) (emphasis supplied). Some\r\n\noffenses are easily recognized as crimes of violence because they\r\n\nare specifically listed in the guideline (e.g., arson), or because\r\n\nan essential element includes the use or threatened use of force\r\n\nagainst another person (e.g., armed robbery).\r\n\n          But an offense not listed, and which does not include\r\n\namong its elements the use, attempted use, or threatened use of\r\n\nforce against another person, still might qualify under S 4B1.2 if\r\n\nit involves conduct that \"presents a serious potential risk of\r\n\nphysical injury to another.\" Whether such an offense qualifies on\r\n\nthat ground is determined according to a standard generic approach,\r\n\n\"in which inquiry is restricted to the statutory definition[] of\r\n\nthe prior offense[], without regard to the particular facts\r\n\nunderlying [it].\"  United \r                                    States v. Meader, No. 96-2123, 1997 WL\r\n\n375003, at *6 (1st Cir. July 11, 1997);  accord United \r                                                                 States v.\r\n\nSchofield, 114 F.3d 350, 351 (1st Cir. 1997); Winter, 22 F.3d at\r\n\n18; \r             cf. \r                 Taylor v. \r                           United States\r                                        , 495 U.S. 575, 600 (1990) (adopting\r\n\na similar categorical approach when determining whether a crime is\r\n\none of violence under the armed career criminal provisions of 18\r\n\nU.S.C. S 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)).\r\n\n          As this court has previously held:\r\n\n          [R]ather than investigating the facts and\r\n          circumstances of each earlier conviction, an\r\n          inquiring court, in the usual situation, looks\r\n          exclusively to the crime as the statute of\r\n          conviction defined it; or, put another way,\r\n          the court examines only the statutory\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n          formulation of the predicate crime in order to\r\n          ascertain whether that crime is a crime of\r\n          violence for purposes of the federal\r\n          sentencing guidelines.\r\n\nUnited \r                 States v. DeLuca, 17 F.3d 6, 8 (1st Cir. 1994) (footnote\r\n\nomitted). Only under limited circumstances may a court look beyond\r\n\nthe elements of the crime as statutorily defined and examine\r\n\ndocuments, such as charging papers or jury instructions, in an\r\n\neffort to determine whether the predicate offense should count for\r\n\ncareer offender purposes.   See Taylor, 495 U.S. at 602;   United\r\n\nStates v. DeJesus, 984 F.2d 21, 23 n.5 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\n\n          Here, Fernandez argues that assault and battery on a\r\n\npolice officer should not be classified as a crime of violence\r\n\nunder S 4B1.1 because the criminal statute defining his offense\r\n\n(Mass. Gen. L. ch. 265, S 13D) criminalizes both violent and non-\r\n\nviolent conduct. His point about the statute's scope finds support\r\n\nin this court's opinion in United States v. Harris, 964 F.2d 1234\r\n\n(1st Cir. 1992), where we noted: \"The Massachusetts 'assault and\r\n\nbattery' statute covers two separate crimes -- one involving actual\r\n\n(or potential) physical harm and the other involving a\r\n\n'nonconsensual' but unharmful touching.\"  Id. at 1236.  Because\r\n\n Under the Massachusetts criminal code, both simple assault and\r\nbattery (Mass. Gen. L. ch. 265, S 13A) and assault and battery upon\r\na police officer (Mass. Gen. L. ch. 265, S 13D) are specific intent\r\ncrimes.  Compare Commonwealth v. Chasson, 423 N.E.2d 306, 311 n.4\r\n(Mass. 1981) (\"A conviction of assault and battery requires a\r\nfinding of an intentional striking of the victim.\")          with\r\nCommonwealth v. \r                         Moore, 632 N.E.2d 1234, 1238 (Mass. App. Ct. 1994)\r\n(\"The offense of assault and battery on a police officer requires\r\na specific intent to strike a police officer.\"). The only\r\nsubstantive distinction between the elements of those offenses is\r\nthat with regard to the latter, the defendant must know that the\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nboth violent and non-violent conduct is covered by the statute, and\r\n\nbecause his prior conviction could have been based on the non-\r\n\nviolent variant of assault and battery upon a police officer,\r\n\nFernandez says his prior offense should not have been counted in\r\n\ndeciding his career offender status.\r\n\n          Although we have not directly addressed the precise issue\r\n\nFernandez raises, we have implied that assault and battery upon a\r\n\npolice officer, in violation of Mass. Gen. L. ch. 265, S 13D, is\r\n\nproperly considered a \"crime of violence\" for federal sentencing\r\n\nguidelines purposes.  See United \r                                           States v. Santiago, 83 F.3d 20,\r\n\n26-27 (1st Cir. 1996) (holding that although the defendant was\r\n\nsentenced to less than one year in prison, his conviction for\r\n\nassault and battery against a police officer constituted a\r\n\n\"predicate offense[] within the purview of the career offender\r\n\nguideline.\"); United States v. Pratt, 913 F.2d 982, 993 (1st Cir.\r\n\n1990) (holding that defendant's state misdemeanor convictions, two\r\n\nof which were for assault and battery on a police officer,\r\n\nconstituted predicate \"crimes of violence\" under U.S.S.G.\r\n\nS 4B1.1.); see also United States v. Tracy, 36 F.3d 187, 199 (1st\r\n\nCir. 1994) (holding that defendant had adequate notice of the\r\n\ngovernment's intention, for sentencing purposes, to rely upon his\r\n\nstate conviction for assault and battery upon a police officer and\r\n\nvictim is a police officer, acting in the course of his or her\r\nofficial duties. Accordingly, for the purposes of this discussion,\r\nwe will assume that our reasoning in Harris, supra, applies with\r\nequal force to the crime of assault and battery upon a police\r\nofficer and, therefore, that it is possible to commit that crime by\r\nmeans of a nonconsensual, but unharmful touching of a police\r\nofficer. \r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nconcluding that the district court did not err in considering\r\n\ndefendant's conviction in enhancing his sentence under the Armed\r\n\nCareer Criminal Act.), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 1717 (1995).\r\n\n          In any event, that Fernandez \r                                               might have been convicted of\r\n\nthe non-violent variety of assault and battery upon a police\r\n\nofficer (looking just at the record of conviction and the\r\n\nMassachusetts statute) does not undermine our conclusion that the\r\n\ncrime is, for purposes of U.S.S.G. S 4B1.1, properly categorized as\r\n\na crime of violence. As we have said, the important point\r\n\n          is not the breadth of the statutory sweep but\r\n          the degree of risk, expressed in terms of the\r\n          probability of physical harm presented by the\r\n          mine-run of conduct that falls within the\r\n          heartland of the statute. Applying this test\r\n          in the post- Taylor era, we have repeatedly\r\n          classified as crimes of violence offenses in\r\n          which actual or threatened force against\r\n          another person is likely, although by no means\r\n          certain.\r\n\nDeJesus, 984 F.2d at 24.\r\n\n          It would seem self-evident that assault and battery upon\r\n\na police officer usually involves force against another, and so\r\n\nmeets that standard. At a minimum, assault and battery upon a\r\n\npolice officer requires purposeful and unwelcomed contact with a\r\n\nperson the defendant knows to be a law enforcement officer actually\r\n\nengaged in the performance of official duties. \r                                                        See \r                                                            Commonwealth v.\r\n\nMoore, 632 N.E.2d 1234, 1238 (Mass. App. Ct. 1994). While it is\r\n\ntrue that neither violence, nor the use of force, is an essential\r\n\nelement of the crime as statutorily defined, still, violence, the\r\n\nuse of force, and a serious risk of physical harm are all likely to\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\naccompany an assault and battery upon a police officer.      See,\r\n\ne.g., Winter, 22 F.3d at 20 (\"A categorical approach is not\r\n\nconcerned with testing either the outer limits of statutory\r\n\nlanguage or the myriad of possibilities girdled by that language;\r\n\ninstead, a categorical approach is concerned with the usual type of\r\n\nconduct that the statute purports to proscribe.\").\r\n\n          Our conclusion is entirely consistent with our holding in\r\n\nUnited  \r                 States v.   Harris,  supra. While we acknowledge that\r\n\nMassachusetts does criminalize both violent and non-violent\r\n\nassaults upon police officers in the same criminal statute, we also\r\n\nnecessarily recognize that the conduct proscribed by the statute\r\n\nnearly always involves the intentional striking of a police officer\r\n\nwhile in the performance of official duty. This nearly always\r\n\nposes a serious risk of actual or potential physical force and the\r\n\n Recent Massachusetts cases in which the defendant was charged\r\nwith assault and battery upon a police officer reveal, not\r\nsurprisingly, the consistent involvement of physical force and risk\r\nof injury. Each reported case involved actual (not merely\r\nthreatened) use of force by the defendant and a serious risk of\r\ninjury to the officer or another.  See Commonwealth v. Gogan, 449\r\nN.E.2d 365 (Mass. 1983) (defendant resisted arrest, struggled with\r\nofficer, and fell to ground on top of officer);  Commonwealth v.\r\nGagnon, 643 N.E.2d 1045 (Mass. App. Ct. 1994) (defendant convicted\r\nof masked armed robbery, assault with intent to murder, attempted\r\nmurder, and assault and battery upon a police officer), modified,\r\n645 N.E.2d 696 (Mass. 1995); \r                                      Commonwealth v. \r                                                     Moore, 632 N.E.2d 1234\r\n(Mass. App. Ct. 1994) (defendant grabbed officer's wrist and\r\ndragged him along road with his vehicle); \r                                                   Commonwealth v. \r                                                                   Collins,\r\n627 N.E.2d 941 (Mass. App. Ct. 1994) (defendant head-butted officer\r\nin jaw); Commonwealth v. McCrohan, 610 N.E.2d 326 (Mass. App. Ct.\r\n1993) (defendant initiated a violent struggle with two police\r\nofficers); Commonwealth v. Holmes, 609 N.E.2d 489 (Mass. App. Ct.\r\n1993) (defendant struck officer with car door, knocking him to the\r\nground); Commonwealth v. Gonzalez, 500 N.E.2d 287 (Mass. App. Ct.\r\n1986) (defendant struck officer).\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nlikelihood of physical injury -- to the police officer initially,\r\n\nand to the perpetrator (and even the public) subsequently, when the\r\n\nofficer reacts or attempts to subdue the offender. That law\r\n\nenforcement officers usually carry weapons when on duty only\r\n\nheightens the serious risk of injury associated with such an\r\n\nassault.\r\n\n          Accordingly, we hold that assault and battery upon a\r\n\npolice officer, in violation of Mass. Gen. L. ch. 265, S 13D, is\r\n\ncategorically a crime of violence within the meaning of the career\r\n\noffender provisions of the sentencing guidelines, U.S.S.G. S 4B1.1,\r\n\nnotwithstanding that its statutory definition admits a non-violent\r\n\nmeans of commission.\r\n\n                           Conclusion\r\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we hold that an assault and\r\n\nbattery upon a police officer, in violation of Mass. Gen. L.\r\n\nch. 265, S 13D, is categorically a crime of violence under U.S.S.G.\r\n\nS 4B1.1. Accordingly, the district judge's conclusion that\r\n\nFernandez is a career offender under the guidelines, and the\r\n\nsentence imposed, are affirmed.\r\n\n Of course, a defendant may, in an appropriate case, seek relief\r\nunder the guidelines by filing a departure motion if his or her\r\npredicate offense actually involved the non-violent form of assault\r\nand battery on a police officer. This, however, is not such a\r\ncase. Fernandez did not attempt to show that he actually committed\r\na non-violent form of assault and battery upon a police officer.\r\nInstead, he has simply asserted that because the underlying state\r\nstatute criminalizes both violent and non-violent conduct alike,\r\nthat crime cannot, as a matter of law, constitute a \"crime of\r\nviolence\" for purposes of determining his career offender status\r\nfor federal sentencing purposes.\r\n\n                               -9-\r\n",

Accordingly, for the purposes of this discussion,\r\nwe will assume that our reasoning in Harris, supra, applies with\r\nequal force to the crime of assault and battery upon a police\r\nofficer and, therefore, that it is possible to commit that crime by\r\nmeans of a nonconsensual, but unharmful touching of a police\r\nofficer. \r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nconcluding that the district court did not err in considering\r\n\ndefendant's conviction in enhancing his sentence under the Armed\r\n\nCareer Criminal Act.), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

S 4B1.1, properly categorized as\r\n\na crime of violence. As we have said, the important point\r\n\n          is not the breadth of the statutory sweep but\r\n          the degree of risk, expressed in terms of the\r\n          probability of physical harm presented by the\r\n          mine-run of conduct that falls within the\r\n          heartland of the statute. Applying this test\r\n          in the post- Taylor era, we have repeatedly\r\n          classified as crimes of violence offenses in\r\n          which actual or threatened force against\r\n          another person is likely, although by no means\r\n          certain.\r\n\nDeJesus, 984 F.2d at 24.\r\n\n          It would seem self-evident that assault and battery upon\r\n\na police officer usually involves force against another, and so\r\n\nmeets that standard. At a minimum, assault and battery upon a\r\n\npolice officer requires purposeful and unwelcomed contact with a\r\n\nperson the defendant knows to be a law enforcement officer actually\r\n\nengaged in the performance of official duties. \r                                                        See \r                                                            Commonwealth v.\r\n\nMoore, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2047356\"><a href=\"/opinion/2047356/commonwealth-v-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">632</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1234</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1238 (Mass. App. Ct. 1994). While it is\r\n\ntrue that neither violence, nor the use of force, is an essential\r\n\nelement of the crime as statutorily defined, still, violence, the\r\n\nuse of force, and a serious risk of physical harm are all likely to\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\naccompany an assault and battery upon a police officer.      See,\r\n\ne.g., Winter, 22 F.3d at 20 (\"A categorical approach is not\r\n\nconcerned with testing either the outer limits of statutory\r\n\nlanguage or the myriad of possibilities girdled by that language;\r\n\ninstead, a categorical approach is concerned with the usual type of\r\n\nconduct that the statute purports to proscribe.\").\r\n\n          Our conclusion is entirely consistent with our holding in\r\n\nUnited  \r                 States v.   Harris,  supra. While we acknowledge that\r\n\nMassachusetts does criminalize both violent and non-violent\r\n\nassaults upon police officers in the same criminal statute, we also\r\n\nnecessarily recognize that the conduct proscribed by the statute\r\n\nnearly always involves the intentional striking of a police officer\r\n\nwhile in the performance of official duty. This nearly always\r\n\nposes a serious risk of actual or potential physical force and the\r\n\n Recent Massachusetts cases in which the defendant was charged\r\nwith assault and battery upon a police officer reveal, not\r\nsurprisingly, the consistent involvement of physical force and risk\r\nof injury.

That law\r\n\nenforcement officers usually carry weapons when on duty only\r\n\nheightens the serious risk of injury associated with such an\r\n\nassault.\r\n\n          Accordingly, we hold that assault and battery upon a\r\n\npolice officer, in violation of Mass. Gen. L. ch. 265, S 13D, is\r\n\ncategorically a crime of violence within the meaning of the career\r\n\noffender provisions of the sentencing guidelines, U.S.S.G. S 4B1.1,\r\n\nnotwithstanding that its statutory definition admits a non-violent\r\n\nmeans of commission.\r\n\n                           Conclusion\r\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we hold that an assault and\r\n\nbattery upon a police officer, in violation of Mass. Gen. L.\r\n\nch. 265, S 13D, is categorically a crime of violence under U.S.S.G.\r\n\nS 4B1.1. Accordingly, the district judge's conclusion that\r\n\nFernandez is a career offender under the guidelines, and the\r\n\nsentence imposed, are affirmed.\r\n\n Of course, a defendant may, in an appropriate case, seek relief\r\nunder the guidelines by filing a departure motion if his or her\r\npredicate offense actually involved the non-violent form of assault\r\nand battery on a police officer. This, however, is not such a\r\ncase. Fernandez did not attempt to show that he actually committed\r\na non-violent form of assault and battery upon a police officer.\r\nInstead, he has simply asserted that because the underlying state\r\nstatute criminalizes both violent and non-violent conduct alike,\r\nthat crime cannot, as a matter of law, constitute a \"crime of\r\nviolence\" for purposes of determining his career offender status\r\nfor federal sentencing purposes.\r\n\n                               -9-\r\n</pre>",
