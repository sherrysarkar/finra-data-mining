In  Labonte, we  affirmed the\r                                                       \r\n\ndistrict  court's  summary dismissal  of  a    2255  petition\r\n\nalleging  ineffective  assistance of  counsel.    One of  the\r\n\ngrounds  for  denial  of  the  petition  was  its  \"fail[ure]\r\n\nadequately to allege any  cognizable prejudice.\" Id. at 1413.\r                                                                \r\n\nIn his  brief, the appellant  had contended  \"that his  trial\r\n\nattorney  assured him that his sentence would be no more than\r\n\neighteen months, and that  there was simply 'no way'  that he\r\n\nwould be  sentenced as a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G.\r\n\n   4B1.1.\" Id.   In  fact, the  district court  had sentenced\r                          \r\n\nappellant  as  a  career  offender and  imposed  a  262-month\r\n\nsentence.\r\n\n          In finding that appellant had  failed adequately to\r\n\nallege prejudice, we ruled as follows:\r\n\n          An  attorney's  inaccurate prediction  of\r\n          his client's  probable sentence, standing\r\n          alone,  will  not  satisfy the  prejudice\r\n          prong of the ineffective assistance test.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n          Similarly,   [appellant's]   self-serving\r\n          statements  that,  but for  his counsel's\r\n          inadequate advice he  would have  pleaded\r\n          not  guilty,  unaccompanied  by either  a\r\n          claim of innocence or the articulation of\r\n          any plausible defense that he  could have\r\n          raised had  he  opted  for  a  trial,  is\r\n          insufficient to  demonstrate the required\r\n          prejudice.\r\n\nLaBonte, 70 F.3d at 1413.\r                   \r\n\n          In this case, as in LaBonte, the attorney's alleged\r                                                 \r\n\nassurance that petitioner  would receive  a 17-year  sentence\r\n\ndoes  not  satisfy the  prejudice  prong  of the  ineffective\r\n\nassistance  test.   Similarly,  petitioner's  bare allegation\r\n\nthat  his guilty  plea  \"was based  on counsel's  ineffective\r\n\nadvice,\"   is   also   insufficient  to   allege   prejudice.\r\n\nPetitioner  has never  claimed innocence  or articulated  any\r\n\ndefense that  he could have raised  if he had gone  to trial.\r\n\nTherefore,  petitioner   has  failed  adequately   to  allege\r\n\nprejudice.   \"[A]  failure of  proof on  either prong  of the\r\n\nStrickland test  defeats an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel\r                      \r\n\nclaim.\"  Id.  at 1413-14.  The district court  did not err in\r                        \r\n\nfailing  to  hold an  evidentiary  hearing  because, even  if\r\n\npetitioner's  allegations are  accepted  as true,  he is  not\r\n\nentitled to relief.\r\n\n          The   summary  dismissal  of  petitioner's     2255\r\n\npetition is affirmed.\r                                \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",

In  Labonte, we  affirmed the\r                                                       \r\n\ndistrict  court's  summary dismissal  of  a    2255  petition\r\n\nalleging  ineffective  assistance of  counsel.    One of  the\r\n\ngrounds  for  denial  of  the  petition  was  its  \"fail[ure]\r\n\nadequately to allege any  cognizable prejudice.\" Id. at 1413.\r                                                                \r\n\nIn his  brief, the appellant  had contended  \"that his  trial\r\n\nattorney  assured him that his sentence would be no more than\r\n\neighteen months, and that  there was simply 'no way'  that he\r\n\nwould be  sentenced as a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G.\r\n\n   4B1.1.\" Id.   In  fact, the  district court  had sentenced\r                          \r\n\nappellant  as  a  career  offender and  imposed  a  262-month\r\n\nsentence.\r\n\n          In finding that appellant had  failed adequately to\r\n\nallege prejudice, we ruled as follows:\r\n\n          An  attorney's  inaccurate prediction  of\r\n          his client's  probable sentence, standing\r\n          alone,  will  not  satisfy the  prejudice\r\n          prong of the ineffective assistance test.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n          Similarly,   [appellant's]   self-serving\r\n          statements  that,  but for  his counsel's\r\n          inadequate advice he  would have  pleaded\r\n          not  guilty,  unaccompanied  by either  a\r\n          claim of innocence or the articulation of\r\n          any plausible defense that he  could have\r\n          raised had  he  opted  for  a  trial,  is\r\n          insufficient to  demonstrate the required\r\n          prejudice.\r\n\nLaBonte, 70 F.3d at 1413.\r                   \r\n\n          In this case, as in LaBonte, the attorney's alleged\r                                                 \r\n\nassurance that petitioner  would receive  a 17-year  sentence\r\n\ndoes  not  satisfy the  prejudice  prong  of the  ineffective\r\n\nassistance  test.   Similarly,  petitioner's  bare allegation\r\n\nthat  his guilty  plea  \"was based  on counsel's  ineffective\r\n\nadvice,\"   is   also   insufficient  to   allege   prejudice.\r\n\nPetitioner  has never  claimed innocence  or articulated  any\r\n\ndefense that  he could have raised  if he had gone  to trial.\r\n\nTherefore,  petitioner   has  failed  adequately   to  allege\r\n\nprejudice.   \"[A]  failure of  proof on  either prong  of the\r\n\nStrickland test  defeats an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel\r                      \r\n\nclaim.\"  Id.  at 1413-14.  The district court  did not err in\r                        \r\n\nfailing  to  hold an  evidentiary  hearing  because, even  if\r\n\npetitioner's  allegations are  accepted  as true,  he is  not\r\n\nentitled to relief.\r\n\n          The   summary  dismissal  of  petitioner's     2255\r\n\npetition is affirmed.\r                                \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n</pre>",
