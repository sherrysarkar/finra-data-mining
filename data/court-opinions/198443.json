BEATTY,\r\n\n                Plaintiffs, Appellants,\r\n\n                           v.\r\n\n            MICHAEL BUSINESS MACHINES CORP.,\r\n\n                  Defendant, Appellee.\r\n\n      APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n               FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\r\n\n      [Hon. David M. Cohen, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n           Selya and Stahl, Circuit Judges,\r\n         and Shadur,* Senior District Judge.\r\n\nJ. Michael Conley with whom Conley Haley &amp; Champion was on\r\nbrief for appellant.\r\nTracy D. Hill, with whom Harold J. Friedman and Friedman\r\nBabcock &amp; Gaythwaite, were on brief for appellee.\r\n\nApril 20, 1999\r\n\n               \r\n* Of the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by designation.  STAHL, Circuit Judge. Plaintiffs-appellants Kevin and\r\nCynthia Beatty appeal judgments entered following jury verdicts in\r\nfavor of defendants-appellees Michael Business Machines (\"MBM\") and\r\nIdeal-Werk.  Plaintiffs appeal only the verdict in favor of MBM,\r\nchallenging the district court's jury instructions and aspects of\r\nthe special verdict forms.  Because plaintiffs failed to preserve\r\ntheir appellate issues and no plain error appears in the record, we\r\naffirm.\r\n                          I.\r\nIn 1984, Kevin Beatty's employer, the Casco Northern Bank\r\n(the \"Bank\"), purchased a model 4104 Ideal-Werk \"Destroy-It\" paper\r\nshredder (the \"shredder\") from MBM, the sole distributor of Ideal-\r\nWerk shredders in the United States.  The Bank made several\r\nmodifications to the shredder over the next few years, including\r\nremoval of the conveyor belt that funneled paper into the blade,\r\nreplacement of the 4104 blade with a blade from a different model\r\nshredder (a 4104A shredder), installation of a toggle switch,\r\nremoval of the screws holding the shredder's cover in place, and\r\nattachment of a handle to the now-unattached cover.  \r\nIndependent service technician Ned Boxer made some of the\r\nmodifications, including the installation of the 4104A blade and\r\nthe removal of the conveyor belt.  Boxer testified that he called\r\nMBM when the 4104 blade was beyond repair, and that an MBM employee\r\ntold him that 4104 blades were no longer being manufactured.  Thus,\r\nhe had to replace the 4104 blade with a 4104A blade, which was not\r\ndesigned to work with the conveyer belt.  MBM denies giving this\r\nadvice and notes that the 4104 blades were never discontinued.  \r\nIn any event, the lack of a conveyer belt to funnel paper\r\ninto the blade caused the shredder to jam frequently.  Because of\r\nthe repetitive jams, an unknown Bank employee removed the screws\r\nholding the protective cover on the machine and attached a handle\r\nmade of rubber bands and paper clips to the cover.  This\r\nmodification allowed employees to remove the cover more easily to\r\nclear the jams.  Boxer told various Bank employees that the cover's\r\nremoval was dangerous and replaced the screws each time he serviced\r\nthe machine, but the employees continued to remove them.  \r\nOn April 12, 1993, Kevin Beatty was using the shredder to\r\nshred documents at the Bank.  When the shredder jammed, without\r\nstopping the machine, Beatty removed the top cover and then reached\r\nacross to hit the stop button.  As he did this, his right hand\r\nbecame stuck in the shredder, causing him to sustain serious\r\ninjuries.\r\nKevin Beatty sued defendants for strict liability,\r\nnegligence, breach of implied warranty of merchantability, and\r\nbreach of implied warranty for a particular purpose.  Cynthia\r\nBeatty sued defendants for loss of consortium.  After plaintiffs\r\npresented their case, defendants moved for judgment as a matter of\r\nlaw pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50.  In support of their motions,\r\ndefendants argued, inter alia, that the substantial modifications\r\nto the shredder by Boxer and Bank employees constituted efficient,\r\nintervening causes of Kevin Beatty's injuries that insulated them\r\nfrom liability.  The district court decided to hold its decisions\r\non the motions until the completion of defendants' presentation. \r\nAfter defendants rested, the district court granted the motion as\r\nto Kevin Beatty's claim that Ideal-Werk had breached an implied\r\nwarranty of fitness for a particular purpose.  The court also\r\ngranted the motions as to Kevin Beatty's claim for intentional\r\ninfliction of emotional distress.  The remaining claims went to the\r\njury, though the court warned plaintiffs that their case was not a\r\ngood one. \r\nThe night before closing arguments, the parties\r\nconferenced in chambers to discuss the jury instructions and the\r\nproposed special verdict forms.  There is no record of this\r\nconference, and the parties disagree to some extent as to what\r\nactually occurred.  Defendants argue that the court was undecided\r\nas to whether it would give an efficient, intervening cause\r\ninstruction with respect to the claims against MBM, while\r\nplaintiffs assert that the court told them it was very unlikely\r\nthat it would so instruct.  Whatever was said, the district court\r\nultimately decided to instruct the jury regarding efficient,\r\nintervening cause with respect to Kevin Beatty's claims against\r\nboth defendants.  Plaintiffs maintain that they were given no real\r\nadvance notice of this change; defendants say that the court clerk\r\nmet them at the door and showed them the intervening cause\r\ninstructions.\r\nIn any case, while plaintiffs admit that the clerk did\r\ngive both parties draft copies of the jury instructions and the\r\nspecial verdict forms (both of which indicated   although the MBM\r\nverdict form was muddled because of the error discussed in the next\r\nparagraph   that efficient, intervening cause would also be at\r\nissue in Kevin Beatty's claims against MBM) upon their arrival at\r\nthe courthouse, they state that they did not receive any other\r\nnotice of the court's change of heart.  Plaintiffs further claim\r\nthat they had only a moment to review the instructions and verdict\r\nforms prior to closing arguments, and that they thus failed to\r\nappreciate that the court now intended to instruct on efficient,\r\nintervening cause with respect to MBM.  \r\nFurther complicating matters, the draft of special\r\nverdict Form 2 provided to plaintiffs before their closing argument\r\ncontained an unfortunate typographical error.  Question 4 on both\r\nForm 1 (the separate verdict form as to Ideal-Werk) and Form 2 (the\r\nseparate verdict form as to MBM) asked whether the conduct of the\r\nBank, Boxer, or Kevin Beatty constituted an intervening act that\r\nbroke the chain of causation, an inquiry that would not belong in\r\nForm 2 at all if the issue of intervening cause were not indeed\r\nrelevant to Kevin Beatty's claims against MBM as well as against\r\nIdeal-Werk.  But Form 2 mistakenly told the reader to skip Question\r\n4 and go to Question 5 if the reader had answered \"yes\" to\r\nQuestions 1, 2, or 3.  Questions 1, 2, and 3 asked, respectively,\r\nwhether MBM was negligent in supplying the 4104A blade, whether MBM\r\nhad breached the implied warranty of merchantable quality with\r\nregard to that blade, and whether MBM had breached the implied\r\nwarranty of reasonable fitness for a particular purpose with regard\r\nto the blade.  Plaintiffs claim that they did not read Question 4\r\nbecause their case against MBM depended on a \"yes\" answer to\r\nQuestions 1, 2, or 3, and because the Form 2 they were given\r\ninstructed them to skip to Question 5 if Questions 1, 2, or 3 were\r\nanswered \"yes.\" Thus, for this additional reason, plaintiffs\r\ncontend that the special verdict form failed to provide them with\r\nnotice that the court intended to instruct the jury on efficient,\r\nintervening cause with respect to the claims against MBM.\r\nDuring closing arguments, defendants discussed all of the\r\nBank's modifications to the machine.  Defendants did not\r\ndistinguish between Ideal-Werk and MBM, but referred to both\r\nthroughout.  Plaintiffs did not object to defendants' closing\r\narguments and, in rebuttal, argued that the toggle switch was\r\nirrelevant to the accident.  Plaintiffs did not address the issue\r\nof intervening cause as to MBM during their closing argument.\r\nAfter closing arguments, the district court instructed\r\nthe jury.  The court told the jury that, because of the doctrine of\r\njoint and several liability, both defendants were liable if there\r\nwas a defect in the shredder's design.  It further instructed that\r\nonly MBM could be found liable for the subsequent sale of the 4104A\r\nblade or for breach of the implied warranty of fitness.  The court\r\nthen explained the concept of efficient, intervening cause to the\r\njury.  Here, the court explicitly referred to the manufacturer and\r\nthe distributor.  The court switched between referring to \"both\r\ndefendants\" and Ideal-Werk alone, but clearly referred to both MBM\r\nand Ideal-Werk throughout the instructions.  Next, the court\r\ndiscussed the special verdict forms.  Form 1 covered the sale of\r\nthe shredder in 1984, while Form 2 covered the sale of the\r\nreplacement heads, and thus pertained to the claims against MBM\r\nalone.  The court read through Form 1 in detail, including Question\r\n4, which was the intervening cause instruction.  The court then\r\nreviewed Form 2 in less detail.  Yet the court did tell the jury\r\nthat the forms were the same but for the first three questions,\r\nwhich it read aloud.  Finally, the court specifically told the jury\r\nto \"go to Question 4\" if it answered \"yes\" to Questions 1, 2, or 3\r\non both forms.  As we have observed, the court did not explicitly\r\npoint out the typographical error to counsel, see supra note 1, but\r\nit did read the corrected instruction on Form 2 aloud.  When asked\r\nfor objections to the forms, plaintiffs' counsel not only failed to\r\nobject, but also commented that the forms were \"excellent.\"    \r\nDuring its deliberations, the jury had a question about\r\nefficient, intervening cause.  With the parties present, the\r\ndistrict court instructed the jury on the concept again, stating\r\nseveral times that the efficient, intervening cause doctrine was\r\napplicable to MBM.  When the court asked for objections, plaintiffs\r\nagain answered that they were satisfied.\r\nAfter deliberating, the jury returned verdicts for\r\ndefendants on both forms.  The jury had answered \"yes\" to the first\r\nthree questions on Form 2, i.e., that MBM was negligent, that it\r\nhad breached the implied warranty of merchantable quality, and that\r\nit had breached the implied warranty of reasonable fitness.  But\r\nthe jury also answered \"yes\" to Question 4, which asked if the\r\nBank's conduct, Boxer's conduct, or Beatty's conduct constituted an\r\nefficient, intervening act.  Because it answered \"yes\" to Question\r\n4, the jury found that MBM was not liable per its instructions. \r\nThe district court entered judgments for defendants and this appeal\r\nfollowed.\r\n                         II.\r\nPlaintiffs contend that the evidence was insufficient to\r\nwarrant the introduction of the issue of efficient, intervening\r\ncause into their case against MBM.  Plaintiffs further argue that\r\ntheir failure to object to the portions of the jury instructions\r\nand verdict forms that erroneously discussed the concept should be\r\nforgiven because of the irregularities surrounding the court's\r\ndecisionmaking process.  We reject the latter argument and decline\r\nto reach the former.\r\nFed. R. Civ. P. 51 requires a party to object to an\r\ninstruction \"before the jury retires . . . stating distinctly the\r\nmatter objected to and the grounds of the objection.\"  Silence\r\nafter jury instructions \"typically constitutes a waiver of any\r\nobjections\" for purposes of appeal.  Putnam Resources v. Pateman,\r\n958 F.2d 448, 456 (1st Cir. 1992).  Our standard of review thus\r\ndiffers depending on whether the issue was preserved.  \"If a party\r\ncomplies with Rule 51, then the 'harmless error' standard of Rule\r\n61 governs . . . the appellate court's consideration of any request\r\nfor relief based on the alleged error.\"  Scarfo v. Cabletron Sys.\r\nInc., 54 F.3d 931, 939 (1st Cir. 1995).  But if a party does not\r\ncomply with Rule 51, the issue is not preserved, and we review only\r\nfor \"plain\" error.  See Moore v. Murphy, 47 F.3d 8, 11 (1st Cir.\r\n1995).  \"The object of this rule is to afford the trial judge an\r\nopportunity upon second thought, and before it is too late, to\r\ncorrect any inadvertent or erroneous failure to charge.\"  Marshallv. Nugent, 222 F.2d 604, 615 (1st Cir. 1955).  \r\nPlaintiffs did not comply with Rule 51 in this case. \r\nAlthough plaintiffs argue that they did not have enough notice of\r\nthe court's intention to give an efficient, intervening cause\r\ninstruction with regard to the case against MBM, the record belies\r\ntheir claim.  Indeed, the record shows that plaintiffs had numerous\r\noccasions to object.  The district court advised both parties\r\nduring its instructions that the doctrine of efficient, intervening\r\ncause applied to both the manufacturer and the distributor. \r\nMoreover, the district court reviewed the special verdict forms in\r\nsufficient detail that counsel should have been aware that the\r\ndraft special verdict Form 2 distributed just before closing\r\narguments contained a typographical error.  Finally, the court's\r\nresponse to the jury's question during deliberations made very\r\nclear its view that the doctrine of intervening cause applied to\r\nthe claims against MBM.  Through it all, plaintiffs remained\r\nsilent.  Thus, we review only for plain error.\r\nThe plain error exception \"'should be applied sparingly\r\nand only in exceptional cases or under peculiar circumstances to\r\nprevent a clear miscarriage of justice.'\" Wells Real Estate v.\r\nGreater Lowell Bd. of Realtors, 850 F.2d 803, 809 (1st Cir. 1988)\r\n(quoting Nimrod v. Sylvester, 369 F.2d 870, 873 (1st Cir. 1966)). \r\nThe exception \"'should be confined to the exceptional case where\r\nthe error has seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public\r\nreputation of judicial proceedings.'\" Morris v. Travisono, 528 F.2d\r\n856, 859 (1st Cir. 1976) (quoting 9 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal\r\nPractice and Procedure,  2558, at 675 (1971)).  This is not such\r\na case.  We have reviewed the record with care, and we are doubtful\r\nthat the court's decision to give an intervening cause instruction\r\nwith respect to the claims against MBM can be regarded as an abuse\r\nof discretion.  See United States v. Smith, 145 F.3d 458, 460 (1st\r\nCir. 1998)(the decision whether the evidence warrants a particular\r\ninstruction is committed to the trial court's discretion).  But\r\neven if it can be so regarded, nothing about the putative error\r\neven remotely calls into question the fairness, integrity, or\r\npublic reputation of judicial proceedings.  Along these lines, we\r\nnote that plaintiffs do not argue that the alleged error was\r\n\"plain\"; they only contend that their failure to object should be\r\nexcused.\r\n                         III.\r\nFor the reasons set forth above, we affirm the judgment\r\nbelow in all respects.\r\nAffirmed.  Costs to appellee.\n",

Question 4 on both\r\nForm 1 (the separate verdict form as to Ideal-Werk) and Form 2 (the\r\nseparate verdict form as to MBM) asked whether the conduct of the\r\nBank, Boxer, or Kevin Beatty constituted an intervening act that\r\nbroke the chain of causation, an inquiry that would not belong in\r\nForm 2 at all if the issue of intervening cause were not indeed\r\nrelevant to Kevin Beatty's claims against MBM as well as against\r\nIdeal-Werk.  But Form 2 mistakenly told the reader to skip Question\r\n4 and go to Question 5 if the reader had answered \"yes\" to\r\nQuestions 1, 2, or 3.

But\r\nthe jury also answered \"yes\" to Question 4, which asked if the\r\nBank's conduct, Boxer's conduct, or Beatty's conduct constituted an\r\nefficient, intervening act.  Because it answered \"yes\" to Question\r\n4, the jury found that MBM was not liable per its instructions. \r\nThe district court entered judgments for defendants and this appeal\r\nfollowed.\r\n                         II.\r\nPlaintiffs contend that the evidence was insufficient to\r\nwarrant the introduction of the issue of efficient, intervening\r\ncause into their case against MBM.  Plaintiffs further argue that\r\ntheir failure to object to the portions of the jury instructions\r\nand verdict forms that erroneously discussed the concept should be\r\nforgiven because of the irregularities surrounding the court's\r\ndecisionmaking process.  We reject the latter argument and decline\r\nto reach the former.\r\nFed. R. Civ. P. 51 requires a party to object to an\r\ninstruction \"before the jury retires . . . stating distinctly the\r\nmatter objected to and the grounds of the objection.\"  Silence\r\nafter jury instructions \"typically constitutes a waiver of any\r\nobjections\" for purposes of appeal.

Our standard of review thus\r\ndiffers depending on whether the issue was preserved.  \"If a party\r\ncomplies with Rule 51, then the 'harmless error' standard of Rule\r\n61 governs . . . the appellate court's consideration of any request\r\nfor relief based on the alleged error.\"  Scarfo v.

But if a party does not\r\ncomply with Rule 51, the issue is not preserved, and we review only\r\nfor \"plain\" error.  See Moore v. Murphy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195886\"><a href=\"/opinion/195886/moore-v-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 11 (1st Cir.\r\n1995).  \"The object of this rule is to afford the trial judge an\r\nopportunity upon second thought, and before it is too late, to\r\ncorrect any inadvertent or erroneous failure to charge.\"  Marshallv.

Indeed, the record shows that plaintiffs had numerous\r\noccasions to object.  The district court advised both parties\r\nduring its instructions that the doctrine of efficient, intervening\r\ncause applied to both the manufacturer and the distributor. \r\nMoreover, the district court reviewed the special verdict forms in\r\nsufficient detail that counsel should have been aware that the\r\ndraft special verdict Form 2 distributed just before closing\r\narguments contained a typographical error.  Finally, the court's\r\nresponse to the jury's question during deliberations made very\r\nclear its view that the doctrine of intervening cause applied to\r\nthe claims against MBM.  Through it all, plaintiffs remained\r\nsilent.  Thus, we review only for plain error.\r\nThe plain error exception \"'should be applied sparingly\r\nand only in exceptional cases or under peculiar circumstances to\r\nprevent a clear miscarriage of justice.'\" Wells Real Estate v.\r\nGreater Lowell Bd. of Realtors, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"508416\"><a href=\"/opinion/508416/wells-real-estate-inc-v-greater-lowell-board-of-realtors/\"><span class=\"volume\">850</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">803</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 809 (1st Cir. 1988)\r\n(quoting Nimrod v.

Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal\r\nPractice and Procedure,  2558, at 675 (1971)).  This is not such\r\na case.  We have reviewed the record with care, and we are doubtful\r\nthat the court's decision to give an intervening cause instruction\r\nwith respect to the claims against MBM can be regarded as an abuse\r\nof discretion.  See United States v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198012\"><a href=\"/opinion/198012/united-states-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">458</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 460 (1st\r\nCir. 1998)(the decision whether the evidence warrants a particular\r\ninstruction is committed to the trial court's discretion).  But\r\neven if it can be so regarded, nothing about the putative error\r\neven remotely calls into question the fairness, integrity, or\r\npublic reputation of judicial proceedings.  Along these lines, we\r\nnote that plaintiffs do not argue that the alleged error was\r\n\"plain\"; they only contend that their failure to object should be\r\nexcused.\r\n                         III.\r\nFor the reasons set forth above, we affirm the judgment\r\nbelow in all respects.\r\nAffirmed.
