George A. O'Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n           Bownes and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   David J. Fine with whom Dangel, Donlan and Fine LLP was on\r\nbrief for appellant.\r\n   William A. McCormack with whom Richelle S. Kennedy and Bingham\r\nDana LLP were on brief for appellee.\r\n\nMay 26, 1998\r\n\nBOUDIN, Circuit Judge.  Jeannine Bernier appeals from the\r\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment in favor of The Upjohn\r\nCompany.  Because we agree with the district court that her suit\r\nwas barred by the statute of limitations, we affirm.  \r\nIn December 1978, when Bernier was 18 years old, she was\r\ndiagnosed with clear cell carcinoma of the vagina.  Her physician,\r\nDr. Robert Knapp, suspected that the cancer might have been caused\r\nby her mother's ingestion of diethylstilbestrol (commonly known as\r\n\"DES\") while pregnant.  During a meeting with Bernier and her\r\nmother, Dr. Knapp asked Bernier's mother whether she had taken DES\r\nwhile pregnant with Bernier; she replied that she had not.\r\nIn January 1979, Bernier underwent a major operation for\r\ntreatment of the cancer.  Ten months later, on November 1, 1979,\r\nDr. Knapp wrote Bernier a letter suggesting that she consider\r\njoining a planned class action law suit--presumably against\r\nmanufacturers--on behalf of women suffering from complications due\r\nto their mothers' use of DES.  Bernier took no action upon\r\nreceiving this letter, nor did she discuss the matter further with\r\nDr. Knapp.\r\nFifteen years later, in 1994, Bernier consulted an\r\nattorney for the first time, after she heard of a verdict awarding\r\nplaintiffs in a DES case several million dollars.  Her attorney\r\nthen unearthed a hospital record belonging to Bernier's mother that\r\nbore the annotation \"Stilb 25 per schedule.\"  Believing \"Stilb\" to\r\nsignify DES (a glance at the full name of the drug explains why),\r\nBernier sued Upjohn in the Massachusetts Superior Court on April\r\n10, 1995, asserting theories of negligence and breach of warranty. \r\nUpjohn removed the case to the district court on grounds of\r\ndiversity.  \r\nAfter discovery, Upjohn moved for summary judgment. \r\nUpjohn argued that the suit was barred by the statute of\r\nlimitations, and also that Bernier could not prove that her mother\r\nhad actually ingested DES made by Upjohn rather than by another DES\r\nmanufacturer.  For reasons recounted below, Bernier did not file a\r\ntimely opposition.  On June 9, 1997, the district court granted the\r\nmotion \"for the reasons set forth in [Upjohn]'s memorandum.\"  After\r\nfailing to win reconsideration, Bernier now appeals.\r\nBernier does not dispute that Massachusetts law\r\nprescribes a limitations period of three years.  See Mass. Gen.\r\nLaws ch. 106,  2-318 (breach of warranty claims); id. ch. 260, \r\n2A (negligence claims).  Generally, negligence claims arise at the\r\ntime of the injury, and breach of warranty claims at the time of\r\nthe breach.  Cambridge Plating Co. v. Napco, Inc., 991 F.2d 21, 25\r\n(1st Cir. 1993).  Admittedly, Bernier's complaint was filed well\r\nover three years after Bernier's injury and the alleged breach.  \r\nNevertheless, various judicial doctrines temper statutes\r\nof limitations, and Bernier here invokes the Massachusetts\r\n\"discovery rule.\"  Under this doctrine, the statute of limitations\r\ndoes not run against a claim until \"an event or events have\r\noccurred that were reasonably likely to put the plaintiff on notice\r\nthat someone may have caused her injury.\"  See Bowen v. Eli Lilly\r\n&amp; Co., 557 N.E.2d 739, 741 (Mass. 1990).  Put another way, the\r\nstatute runs from the point at which a reasonably prudent person in\r\nthe plaintiff's position, \"reacting to any suspicious circumstances\r\nof which he might have been aware,\" would have discovered that\r\nanother party might be liable for her injury.  Malapanis v.\r\nShirazi, 487 N.E.2d 533, 537 (Mass. App. Ct. 1986).  \r\nThis doctrine effectively imposes a duty of reasonable\r\ninquiry on an injured party seeking to avoid the statute of\r\nlimitations.  As soon as one is on notice of an injury, or at least\r\none that may have been caused by a third party, one must act\r\nreasonably in considering and investigating this possibility.  Cf.Wolin v. Smith Barney Inc., 83 F.3d 847, 852-53 (7th Cir. 1996)\r\n(Posner, C.J.).  It is assumed that a reasonable investigation,\r\nbacked by discovery, will unearth the necessary facts to support a\r\nclaim within the limitations period.  If not, the plaintiff can\r\nfall back on an equitable tolling doctrine yet to be discussed. \r\nDr. Knapp's letter to Bernier on November 1, 1979, amply\r\nput Bernier on notice that her cancer might have been caused by a\r\nthird party.  Dr. Knapp wrote: \"you have had clear cell carcinoma,\r\nand it is my opinion that this is related to DES exposure in utero\r\n....  Although I am not a lawyer I feel that you certainly have a\r\nclaim and since I have taken care of you medically I feel\r\nresponsible in offering you any help that I can give to you.\"  It\r\nwould be hard to imagine a clearer warning of a likely claim.\r\nBernier argues that she was not on notice of her claim\r\nbecause her mother had expressly denied having taken DES, but Dr.\r\nKnapp's letter came after this denial, reasonably alerting Bernier\r\nto the possibility that her mother had been mistaken.  Bernier also\r\nsays that she read the letter as a form sent to several of Dr.\r\nKnapp's patients, and yet the letter is addressed to Bernier\r\npersonally.  Whatever her subjective belief, as an objective matter\r\nBernier was put on notice of a potential claim, and a rational jury\r\ncould not find otherwise.\r\nHowever, Bernier has an alternative statute of\r\nlimitations argument, namely, that even a diligent search made in\r\nor around 1979 would not have discovered the vital hospital record\r\nbearing the \"Stilb\" notation.  Under Massachusetts law the doctrine\r\nof equitable tolling suspends a running statute of limitations if\r\na plaintiff exercising reasonable diligence could not have\r\ndiscovered information essential to the suit.  See Protective Life\r\nIns. Co. v. Sullivan, 682 N.E.2d 624, 635 (Mass. 1997). \r\nMassachusetts cases are unclear as to whether plaintiffs who make\r\nno effort to investigate may nonetheless benefit from the doctrine\r\nof equitable tolling.  Cf. Wolin, 82 F.3d at 852-53 (suggesting\r\nthat they cannot, absent deliberate concealment by the defendant). \r\nIn any event, the record does not suggest that the\r\n\"Stilb\" document was in some way concealed or otherwise\r\ninaccessible to Bernier in 1979.  Cf. Friedman v. Jablonski, 358\r\nN.E.2d 994, 997 (Mass. 1976).  Nor does Bernier offer any rationale\r\nfor concluding that her attorney could not have discovered it in\r\n1980 as readily as he did in 1994.  A party seeking to toll the\r\nstatute must at the very least show that the information could nothave been found by a timely diligent inquiry, a showing Bernier\r\ndoes not even attempt on the existing record.\r\nIn her final argument, Bernier asks in effect that we\r\nenlarge the record by considering her belated opposition to summary\r\njudgment.  In this regard, she asserts that the district court\r\nerred in denying the motion to reconsider, which was filed together\r\nwith her summary judgment opposition two days after summary\r\njudgment was granted.  We hold that the district court did not\r\nabuse its discretion, the customary standard applied on review of\r\nsuch a ruling.  Mendez v. Banco Popular de P.R., 900 F.2d 4, 7 (1st\r\nCir. 1990).\r\nThe chronology is important.  After extending the\r\ndiscovery deadline twice, the second time over Upjohn's opposition,\r\nthe district court set April 15, 1997, as the due date for the\r\nsummary judgment motion and April 29 as the date for an opposition,\r\nwith a hearing set for June 9.  Upjohn filed on time and the court\r\nthen sent out a notice confirming the hearing date.  By stipulated\r\norder, Bernier's time to oppose was then extended to May 13.  \r\nInstead of filing her opposition, Bernier filed a motion\r\non May 12 asking for a month's extra time to oppose the motion and\r\nfour more months to complete expert discovery.  The court denied\r\nthe requests and Bernier's counsel received notice of the denial on\r\nMay 27 or 28.  Bernier's counsel did not file the opposition with\r\na request to accept it late, apparently because the opposition was\r\nnot yet complete.  And on June 9, when the case was called for\r\nhearing, Bernier's counsel did not appear.  The court then granted\r\nUpjohn's summary judgment motion and recessed.\r\nBernier's counsel says that he arrived late and says that\r\nhe had telephoned the courtroom clerk to say that he would be late. \r\nHe also says that the burden of other work required the extension\r\nand that he expected it to be granted in light of prior extensions. \r\nBut in all events no opposition to summary judgment was filed until\r\nJune 11, together with a motion for reconsideration.  In a\r\nthoughtful three-page memorandum, the district court denied the\r\nmotion.\r\nGiven the latitude normally allowed to district courts on\r\nboth scores--schedule setting and reconsideration motions--no claim\r\nof abuse of discretion is even arguable.  Contrary to counsel's\r\nsuggestion, the district court imposed no unjust \"sanction,\" cf.Robson v. Hallenbeck, 81 F.3d 1, 2-3 (1st Cir. 1996), for the\r\nfailure to file the opposition:  it simply decided the summary\r\njudgment motion on the merits, taking the movant's facts as\r\nuncontested, just as the governing rules warn will occur absent an\r\nopposition.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e); D. Mass. Loc. R. 56.1.      \r\nWe cannot accept the notion that the grant of prior\r\nextensions entitles counsel to suppose that any additional\r\nextension will be granted as a matter of course.  Not only would\r\nthis undermine any kind of procedural discipline, but it is well\r\nknown that courts become more reluctant to extend deadlines as\r\nscheduled court proceedings loom.  Further, Bernier's counsel did\r\nnot even attempt to file the opposition in the period after notice\r\nof the denial was received and before the scheduled hearing.\r\nWe add--not in mitigation of counsel's omission but out\r\nof concern for Bernier's feelings--that the belated opposition\r\nwould not likely have altered the result on the statute of\r\nlimitations defense.  On this issue, the main thrust of the\r\nopposition is evidence that by 1979, the doctor who had treated\r\nBernier's mother during her pregnancy had retired and his records\r\nhad been disposed of.  Whether the doctor could still have been\r\ninterviewed in 1979 is unclear.\r\nHowever this may be, there is no explanation given why\r\nthe due diligence that in 1994 uncovered the \"Stilb\" notation in\r\nthe hospital records would not also have uncovered it in 1979. \r\nWithout such a showing, Bernier could hardly prove that her\r\nmother's use of DES was effectively not discoverable in 1979. \r\nWhile counsel's delay thus seemingly had no effect in this case,\r\nlawyers faced with deadlines in the future should treat this case\r\nas a warning.\r\nAffirmed.\n",

Whether the doctor could still have been\r\ninterviewed in 1979 is unclear.\r\nHowever this may be, there is no explanation given why\r\nthe due diligence that in 1994 uncovered the \"Stilb\" notation in\r\nthe hospital records would not also have uncovered it in 1979. \r\nWithout such a showing, Bernier could hardly prove that her\r\nmother's use of DES was effectively not discoverable in 1979. \r\nWhile counsel's delay thus seemingly had no effect in this case,\r\nlawyers faced with deadlines in the future should treat this case\r\nas a warning.\r\nAffirmed.\n</pre>",
