Seven years  later, after attaining  their majority,\r\n\nplaintiffs discovered Grayson's  misrepresentation and took their\r\n\nallegations to  the district attorney.  Their father presently is\r\n\nserving a lengthy  prison sentence, following his  conviction for\r\n\naggravated sexual assault.\r\n\n          Plaintiffs filed  the instant  action against  the Town\r\n\nand  Grayson, in his individual and official capacities, claiming\r\n\ninter  alia  that  Grayson  refrained  from  investigating  their\r                     \r\n\nallegations either  because plaintiffs were  female, children, or\r\n\nvictims of  domestic sexual  abuse, and  that such selective  law\r\n\nenforcement  violated  their  individual rights  under  the Equal\r\n\nProtection Clause.  See U.S. Const. amend XIV; 42 U.S.C.   1983.1\r                                 \r\n\nIn due  course, the equal  protection count against the  Town was\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1It  is undisputed  that Grayson  at all  times acted  under\r\ncolor of state law.

Following  discovery, defendant  Grayson was  awarded\r\n\nsummary  judgment  on   the  individual-capacity  claim   because\r\n\nplaintiffs  had  failed  to adduce  sufficient  evidence  that he\r\n\nintended to  discriminate due to  their membership in any  of the\r\n\nthree classes alleged  in their  complaint.   The district  court\r\n\nthereafter   denied    plaintiffs'   postjudgment    motion   for\r\n\nreconsideration.  See Fed. R. Civ.

See Dominique v.  Weld, 73  F.3d 1156, 1158  (1st Cir.\r                                           \r\n1996).  \r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nrace   and  gender   classifications,  which   necessitated  that\r\n\nplaintiffs show  that Grayson  acted with  discriminatory intent.\r\n\nInstead,  plaintiffs argue, in cases involving less invidious but\r\n\nnonetheless arbitrary classifications,  such as child victims  of\r\n\ndomestic sexual abuse, Cleburne simply envisions  that plaintiffs\r                                         \r\n\nprove  that the defendant's  decision lacked a  \"rational basis,\"\r\n\nwithout regard to any discriminatory intent.3\r\n\n          Plaintiffs misconstrue  the Cleburne  decision.   There\r                                                        \r\n\nthe  Supreme  Court  expressly  noted  the  finding  made  by the\r\n\ndistrict  court  that  the municipality's  principal  reason  for\r\n\ndenying the requested zoning permit had been \"that  the residents\r\n\nof  the  [plaintiff] home  would  be  persons  who  are  mentally\r\n\nretarded,\" id.  at 437, a  finding which was never  challenged on\r                        \r\n\nappeal.   Thus, it  was only  because  the city's  discriminatory\r\n\nmotive had been  established ab initio  that the Court  addressed\r                                                \r\n\nwhether the city  need demonstrate a \"compelling\"  or \"important\"\r\n\nstate  interest     criteria theretofore  reserved  for race  and\r\n\ngender discrimination      or need simply  articulate a \"rational\r\n\nbasis\" for its  decision.  Id. at 440-41.   Accordingly, Cleburne\r                                                                           \r\n\ndid not hold that no threshold proof of intent to discriminate is\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3The  Equal Protection Clause  safeguards not merely against\r\nsuch  invidious classifications as race, gender and religion, but\r\nany   arbitrary  classification   of   persons  for   unfavorable\r\ngovernmental treatment.   Cf. Wayte  v. United  States, 470  U.S.\r                                                                \r\n598, 608  (1985) (noting,  in relation  to selective  prosecution\r\ncases, that \"the  decision to prosecute may not  be 'deliberately\r\nbased  upon an unjustifiable standard  such as race, religion, or\r\nother arbitrary classification'\") (emphasis added; citations  and\r                                        \r\ninternal quotation marks omitted).\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nrequired   in   cases    involving   less   invidious   arbitrary\r\n\nclassifications.4 \r\n\n          The motivation  underlying a municipal decision  is not\r\n\nalways so apparent  as in Cleburne, of course,  especially if the\r                                            \r\n\nchallenged  decision does not  expressly single out  a particular\r\n\nclass of persons  for disadvantageous  treatment.   Even in  such\r\n\ninstances,  however,  members   of  the  plaintiff   class  quite\r\n\nunderstandably  may  consider  it  no  mere  coincidence  that  a\r\n\nfacially neutral decision causes a disproportionately unfavorable\r\n\nimpact on their particular class.  Nevertheless, even evidence of\r\n\na  widely disproportionate impact on the plaintiff class normally\r\n\nis  not enough, standing alone,  to establish an equal protection\r\n\nviolation.   See, e.g., Personnel  Adm'r of Mass. v.  Feeney, 442\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S.  256, 274-75 (1979) (upholding veteran's preference in civil\r\n\nservice hiring,  although vast  majority of  veterans hired  were\r\n\nmale).   Rather,  plaintiffs must  adduce  competent evidence  of\r\n\n\"purposeful  discrimination.\"  Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229,\r                                                            \r\n\n243-44 (1976);  Soto v.

Ct. 71 (1997).\r                      \r\n\n          The  burden  is  an  onerous  one:     \"'Discriminatory\r\n\npurpose' . . .  implies that the decisionmaker . .  . selected or\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4The other case relied upon  by plaintiffs in this regard is\r\nto the same  effect.

Thus, unless these plaintiffs\r                        \r\n\nestablished the  requisite  discriminatory  intent,  their  equal\r\n\nprotection  claim  cannot  succeed  even  assuming  the   Grayson\r\n\ndecision not  to  investigate lacked  a  \"rational basis.\"    See\r                                                                           \r\n\nVillage  of Arlington Heights  v.

City of  Moundsville, 963 F.\r                                                                   \r\n\nSupp. 1416, 1433 (N.D. W. Va. 1997).\r\n\n          Plaintiffs claim  that the  district court  disregarded\r\n\ncompetent evidence  that Grayson  harbored \"archaic  stereotypes\"\r\n\nregarding female-child sexual abuse in  the home and singled  out\r\n\nits victims for  unfavorable treatment in determining  whether to\r\n\ninvestigate.    The  record does  not  support  their contention,\r\n\nhowever.5\r\n\n          At no time did Grayson indicate to anyone that he would\r\n\nnot  investigate allegations  of child sexual  abuse in  the home\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5Plaintiffs adduced no evidence that Grayson's reluctance to\r\npursue criminal investigations was based on their gender.  On the\r\ncontrary, plaintiffs  proffered evidence  that Grayson  failed to\r\ninvestigate a  1990 allegation  that a  12-year-old boy had  been\r\nsexually molested by his grandfather.   Nor did plaintiffs adduce\r\nstatistical  or   other  evidence  relating  to  whether  females\r\ncomprise  a majority  of (1) sexual  abuse victims;  (2) domestic\r\nsexual abuse victims; (3)  sexually abused minors; or (4)  minors\r\nsexually  abused  in  the  home.    Furthermore,  Officer  Boutin\r\nattested that though Grayson often did  not pursue allegations of\r\ncrimes  committed against children if a nonoffending adult family\r\nmember urged him  not to do so,  this \"policy\" did not  depend on\r\nwhether the  victims were  male or  female.   See  infra note  8.\r                                                                  \r\nGiven  its serious deficiencies,  the gender classification claim\r\nquite properly was rejected by the district court.\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nbecause he  thought the  victims were  undeserving of  equal law-\r\n\nenforcement  protection.   Instead,  he  explained  to  a  fellow\r\n\nofficer  that he  had  refrained  from investigating  plaintiffs'\r\n\nallegations at their  mother's request.6  Another  police officer\r\n\nconfirmed that it  was Grayson's policy not to  intervene where a\r\n\nfamily  member (e.g., nonabusive parent or spouse) requested that\r                              \r\n\nthere be no investigation.\r\n\n          Plaintiffs essentially  claim, nonetheless,  that their\r\n\nevidence  supported,   respectively,  rational   inferences  that\r\n\nGrayson intended  to treat  all domestic  crime differently  from\r\n\nnondomestic crime, all  crimes against children differently  from\r\n\ncrimes  against adults, and  all sexual abuse  crimes differently\r\n\nfrom nonsexual  crimes.7  Once  again the evidence does  not bear\r\n\nout their claim.\r\n\n          Plaintiffs' proffer disclosed  that the nonintervention\r\n\npolicy  attributed to  Grayson may  have  been much  broader than\r\n\nplaintiffs allow, in that it applied not merely to domestic child\r\n\nsexual abuse, but to other crimes in circumstances where  general\r\n\nconcerns  for family integrity  and family privacy predominated.8\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6Specifically, the  mother told  Grayson that  \"she did  not\r\nwant the girls  involved in a prosecution.\"   Plaintiffs have not\r\ncontested this evidence. \r\n\n     7The  district  court  reserved  the  question  whether  the\r\nevidence   relating  to   Grayson's  own   statements  would   be\r\nadmissible.   See Fed.  R. Evid.  801(d)(2) (admission  by party-\r                           \r\nopponent).\r\n\n     8In  the  portion of  Officer Boutin's  deposition proffered\r\nbelow, the inquiry  is ambiguously phrased by plaintiffs in terms\r\nof how Grayson acted \"in these kinds of cases\" compared to \"other\r\n[] more  conventional kinds  of crimes,\"  without particularizing\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nThus, their  proffer may be  seen to belie their  contention that\r\n\nGrayson  sought to discriminate  against them because  of, rather\r                                                                   \r\n\nthan in  spite of, their status as  victims of child sexual abuse\r                           \r\n\nin  the  home.    See  Feeney,  422  U.S.  at  279.     Far  from\r                                       \r\n\ndemonstrating  general condonation of  child sexual abuse  in the\r\n\nhome,  therefore,  the  proffer  simply  supported  a  reasonable\r\n\ninference that Grayson would investigate virtually any allegation\r                                                                           \r\n\nof crime absent an appropriate request from a nonoffending spouse\r                         \r\n\nto refrain  from intervention in circumstances  where legitimate,\r\n\ncompeting   family  interests   were   thought  to   predominate.\r\n\nAccordingly,  although  the evidence  may well  have demonstrated\r\n\nthat  the Grayson nonintervention  policy had  a disproportionate\r\n\nadverse impact  in cases  involving allegations  relating to  the\r\n\nvarious victim classes in which plaintiffs claimed membership, it\r\n\ndid not demonstrate that Grayson harbored a discriminatory animus\r\n\ntoward those  victim classes.   Id. at  274 (upholding  veteran's\r                                             \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nany   characteristic   of   these   alleged  crimes   which   was\r                              \r\nunconventional  in their view  (e.g., domestic, sexual  abuse, or\r                                              \r\ncrimes  against children or  female victims), or  which triggered\r\nthe  Grayson nonintervention  policy.    Perhaps  for  this  very\r\nreason,  then,  Officer  Boutin  ambiguously  responded  that the\r\npolice \"took  into [account]  what the mother  had to say  or the\r                                                                       \r\nvictim's  rights  were, I  mean,  emotions  were,\"  and  \"if  the\r                \r\nfamily's  wishes were  that  it didn't  get  prosecuted, then  it\r                \r\ndidn't.\"       Although   Boutin   allowed   that   the   Grayson\r\nnonintervention policy would apply to crimes against children, at\r\nno time  did he state that it applied exclusively to such crimes.\r\nThese   unaddressed  ambiguities   plainly  invited   a  rational\r\ninference  that   the  challenged   nonintervention  policy   was\r\npredicated  on a  generalized concern  for  family integrity  and\r\nprivacy, which would  be activated, for example, at  the instance\r\nof a  nonoffending spouse  even though  the allegations may  have\r\nrelated  to nonsexual criminal activity directed against an adult\r\nfamily member.\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\npreference in civil service hiring,  even though vast majority of\r\n\nveteran hirees were male).\r\n\n          Similarly, plaintiffs presented  evidence that Grayson,\r\n\non  two other  occasions, failed  to  investigate allegations  of\r\n\nchild sexual abuse in  the home.  Once again, however,  there was\r\n\nno  evidence that  Grayson  was  motivated  by  a  discriminatory\r\n\nanimus, as distinguished  from a neutral  nonintervention policy.\r\n\nMoreover,  Grayson proffered  undisputed  evidence  that  he  had\r\n\ninvestigated  at  least  two other  domestic  child  sexual abuse\r\n\ncases, as  well as  eight nondomestic  child sexual  abuse cases.\r\n\nCf. Willhauck  v. Halpin, 953  F.2d 689, 712 (1st  Cir. 1991) (in\r                                  \r\n\nanalogous  context of equal protection claim founded on selective\r\n\nprosecution, \"[i]t must  be shown that others  similarly situated\r\n\nhave not been  prosecuted and that the decision  to prosecute has\r\n\nbeen motivated by an impermissible reason\").\r\n\n          Finally, in  an ironic twist, the  discriminatory focus\r\n\nessential to plaintiffs' equal protection claims was irredeemably\r\n\nblurred  by their proffer that the Grayson nonintervention policy\r\n\nextended well beyond domestic child  sexual abuse cases (e.g., to\r                                                                       \r\n\nDWI  and vandalism),  and may  even  have been  due to  Grayson's\r\n\ndishonesty, chronic lassitude,  alcohol abuse, or desire  to wage\r\n\npersonal  vendettas against  particular  individuals rather  than\r\n\ngroups.   See  New  Burnham  Prairie Homes,  Inc.  v. Village  of\r                                                                           \r\n\nBurnham,  910  F.2d  1474,  1481  (7th Cir.  1990)  (noting  that\r                 \r\n\n\"[d]iscrimination based merely on individual,  rather than group,\r\n\nreasons   will  not  suffice\"   to  establish   equal  protection\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nviolation).  That is to  say, although their scattershot approach\r\n\nmight enable a rational inference  that Grayson was a poor police\r\n\nchief,  it  cannot  sustain a  nonspeculative  inference  that he\r\n\nfailed to investigate  these allegations because plaintiffs  were\r                                                          \r\n\nchildren who  had been sexually abused, or because plaintiffs had\r                                                            \r\n\nbeen sexually abused  in the home.

As Grayson was  a policymaking official, with discretion\r\nin law  enforcement matters,  plaintiffs were  required to  prove\r\nthat he  acted with \"purposeful  discrimination.\"  Yet  there has\r                                         \r\nbeen  no  showing that  whatever  training  was  not provided  to\r\nGrayson could have  thwarted any such  purposeful discrimination.\r\nWhereas  law enforcement training  might inform an  officer about\r\nthe proper methods  to be used in mediating  and diffusing crimes\r\nof domestic violence, for example, it does not necessarily follow\r\nthat an  officer intent  on discriminating  against a  particular\r                                 \r\nclass  of  crime victims  would  be  deterred  from doing  so  by\r\n\"enlightenment\" training, especially  given the contraindications\r\nimplicit  in  plaintiffs'  other  evidence  that  the  challenged\r\ndecisionmaking by Grayson resulted from alcohol abuse, lassitude,\r\nor personal animosity  toward individuals.

It would be dereliction of duty for a police chief to\r\n\nturn  over  to private  parties  the decision  whether  a serious\r\n\noffense should  be pursued and it  is hard to imagine  what might\r\n\njustify telling a  complainant falsely that the  prosecutor would\r\n\nhave no interest in the  complaint.

Va. 1997).\r\n\n          Plaintiffs claim  that the  district court  disregarded\r\n\ncompetent evidence  that Grayson  harbored \"archaic  stereotypes\"\r\n\nregarding female-child sexual abuse in  the home and singled  out\r\n\nits victims for  unfavorable treatment in determining  whether to\r\n\ninvestigate.    The  record does  not  support  their contention,\r\n\nhowever.5\r\n\n          At no time did Grayson indicate to anyone that he would\r\n\nnot  investigate allegations  of child sexual  abuse in  the home\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5Plaintiffs adduced no evidence that Grayson's reluctance to\r\npursue criminal investigations was based on their gender.  On the\r\ncontrary, plaintiffs  proffered evidence  that Grayson  failed to\r\ninvestigate a  1990 allegation  that a  12-year-old boy had  been\r\nsexually molested by his grandfather.   Nor did plaintiffs adduce\r\nstatistical  or   other  evidence  relating  to  whether  females\r\ncomprise  a majority  of (1) sexual  abuse victims;  (2) domestic\r\nsexual abuse victims; (3)  sexually abused minors; or (4)  minors\r\nsexually  abused  in  the  home.    Furthermore,  Officer  Boutin\r\nattested that though Grayson often did  not pursue allegations of\r\ncrimes  committed against children if a nonoffending adult family\r\nmember urged him  not to do so,  this \"policy\" did not  depend on\r\nwhether the  victims were  male or  female.   See  infra note  8.\r                                                                  \r\nGiven  its serious deficiencies,  the gender classification claim\r\nquite properly was rejected by the district court.\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nbecause he  thought the  victims were  undeserving of  equal law-\r\n\nenforcement  protection.   Instead,  he  explained  to  a  fellow\r\n\nofficer  that he  had  refrained  from investigating  plaintiffs'\r\n\nallegations at their  mother's request.6  Another  police officer\r\n\nconfirmed that it  was Grayson's policy not to  intervene where a\r\n\nfamily  member (e.g., nonabusive parent or spouse) requested that\r                              \r\n\nthere be no investigation.\r\n\n          Plaintiffs essentially  claim, nonetheless,  that their\r\n\nevidence  supported,   respectively,  rational   inferences  that\r\n\nGrayson intended  to treat  all domestic  crime differently  from\r\n\nnondomestic crime, all  crimes against children differently  from\r\n\ncrimes  against adults, and  all sexual abuse  crimes differently\r\n\nfrom nonsexual  crimes.7  Once  again the evidence does  not bear\r\n\nout their claim.\r\n\n          Plaintiffs' proffer disclosed  that the nonintervention\r\n\npolicy  attributed to  Grayson may  have  been much  broader than\r\n\nplaintiffs allow, in that it applied not merely to domestic child\r\n\nsexual abuse, but to other crimes in circumstances where  general\r\n\nconcerns  for family integrity  and family privacy predominated.8\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6Specifically, the  mother told  Grayson that  \"she did  not\r\nwant the girls  involved in a prosecution.\"   Plaintiffs have not\r\ncontested this evidence. \r\n\n     7The  district  court  reserved  the  question  whether  the\r\nevidence   relating  to   Grayson's  own   statements  would   be\r\nadmissible.   See Fed.  R. Evid.  801(d)(2) (admission  by party-\r                           \r\nopponent).\r\n\n     8In  the  portion of  Officer Boutin's  deposition proffered\r\nbelow, the inquiry  is ambiguously phrased by plaintiffs in terms\r\nof how Grayson acted \"in these kinds of cases\" compared to \"other\r\n[] more  conventional kinds  of crimes,\"  without particularizing\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nThus, their  proffer may be  seen to belie their  contention that\r\n\nGrayson  sought to discriminate  against them because  of, rather\r                                                                   \r\n\nthan in  spite of, their status as  victims of child sexual abuse\r                           \r\n\nin  the  home.    See  Feeney,  422  U.S.  at  279.     Far  from\r                                       \r\n\ndemonstrating  general condonation of  child sexual abuse  in the\r\n\nhome,  therefore,  the  proffer  simply  supported  a  reasonable\r\n\ninference that Grayson would investigate virtually any allegation\r                                                                           \r\n\nof crime absent an appropriate request from a nonoffending spouse\r                         \r\n\nto refrain  from intervention in circumstances  where legitimate,\r\n\ncompeting   family  interests   were   thought  to   predominate.\r\n\nAccordingly,  although  the evidence  may well  have demonstrated\r\n\nthat  the Grayson nonintervention  policy had  a disproportionate\r\n\nadverse impact  in cases  involving allegations  relating to  the\r\n\nvarious victim classes in which plaintiffs claimed membership, it\r\n\ndid not demonstrate that Grayson harbored a discriminatory animus\r\n\ntoward those  victim classes.

Perhaps  for  this  very\r\nreason,  then,  Officer  Boutin  ambiguously  responded  that the\r\npolice \"took  into [account]  what the mother  had to say  or the\r                                                                       \r\nvictim's  rights  were, I  mean,  emotions  were,\"  and  \"if  the\r                \r\nfamily's  wishes were  that  it didn't  get  prosecuted, then  it\r                \r\ndidn't.\"       Although   Boutin   allowed   that   the   Grayson\r\nnonintervention policy would apply to crimes against children, at\r\nno time  did he state that it applied exclusively to such crimes.\r\nThese   unaddressed  ambiguities   plainly  invited   a  rational\r\ninference  that   the  challenged   nonintervention  policy   was\r\npredicated  on a  generalized concern  for  family integrity  and\r\nprivacy, which would  be activated, for example, at  the instance\r\nof a  nonoffending spouse  even though  the allegations may  have\r\nrelated  to nonsexual criminal activity directed against an adult\r\nfamily member.\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\npreference in civil service hiring,  even though vast majority of\r\n\nveteran hirees were male).\r\n\n          Similarly, plaintiffs presented  evidence that Grayson,\r\n\non  two other  occasions, failed  to  investigate allegations  of\r\n\nchild sexual abuse in  the home.  Once again, however,  there was\r\n\nno  evidence that  Grayson  was  motivated  by  a  discriminatory\r\n\nanimus, as distinguished  from a neutral  nonintervention policy.\r\n\nMoreover,  Grayson proffered  undisputed  evidence  that  he  had\r\n\ninvestigated  at  least  two other  domestic  child  sexual abuse\r\n\ncases, as  well as  eight nondomestic  child sexual  abuse cases.\r\n\nCf.

It  is reasonable  to  observe, therefore,  that\r\n\nwhatever relevant training the Town  failed to give Grayson would\r                           \r\n\nnot  have  entailed   specialized  law-enforcement  investigatory\r\n\nskills, but  simply  the commonplace  understanding  that  police\r\n\nofficers  may not deny law-enforcement protection based simply on\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nindividual defendants that the jury exonerated.\").

Nevertheless,  assuming arguendo  that  dismissal of  the\r                                                  \r\nindividual-capacity claim  against Grayson would  not necessitate\r\ndismissal of  the failure-to-train  claim against  the Town,  the\r\nproffered amendment would  still be futile  due to the  stringent\r\ndefinition of  \"deliberate  indifference\" prescribed  in City  of\r                                                                           \r\nCanton.\r                \r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\ntheir  arbitrary  classifications  of  various  groups  of  crime\r\n\nvictims.\r\n\n          Thus,  the  amended  complaint  asserted no  sufficient\r\n\nbasis  for  concluding that  Town policymakers  reasonably should\r\n\nhave anticipated that a  new police chief would need  specialized\r\n\ninstruction in so  rudimentary a law-enforcement  responsibility,\r\n\nnor  that  the  Town had  been  put  on notice  that  such equal-\r\n\nprotection violations  were routine occurrences in domestic child\r\n\nsexual abuse cases, either locally or elsewhere.  Rather,  unlike\r\n\nmany other  law-enforcement responsibilities,  cf., e.g.,  id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n390 &amp;  n.10 (noting  that it might  be considered  \"obvious\" that\r\n\narmed police  officers assigned  to arrest  fleeing felons  would\r\n\nneed instruction  regarding constitutional limitations  on proper\r\n\nuse  of deadly  force), the  Equal Protection Clause  bar against\r\n\narbitrary law enforcement  is neither obscure nor  problematic of\r\n\napplication.14\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     14City of Canton  requires not only  deliberate indifference\r               14              \r\nbut that the alleged  failure to train be shown to  have been the\r\n\"closely  related\" cause  of the  constitutional injury.

As Grayson was  a policymaking official, with discretion\r\nin law  enforcement matters,  plaintiffs were  required to  prove\r\nthat he  acted with \"purposeful  discrimination.\"  Yet  there has\r                                         \r\nbeen  no  showing that  whatever  training  was  not provided  to\r\nGrayson could have  thwarted any such  purposeful discrimination.\r\nWhereas  law enforcement training  might inform an  officer about\r\nthe proper methods  to be used in mediating  and diffusing crimes\r\nof domestic violence, for example, it does not necessarily follow\r\nthat an  officer intent  on discriminating  against a  particular\r                                 \r\nclass  of  crime victims  would  be  deterred  from doing  so  by\r\n\"enlightenment\" training, especially  given the contraindications\r\nimplicit  in  plaintiffs'  other  evidence  that  the  challenged\r\ndecisionmaking by Grayson resulted from alcohol abuse, lassitude,\r\nor personal animosity  toward individuals.

It would be dereliction of duty for a police chief to\r\n\nturn  over  to private  parties  the decision  whether  a serious\r\n\noffense should  be pursued and it  is hard to imagine  what might\r\n\njustify telling a  complainant falsely that the  prosecutor would\r\n\nhave no interest in the  complaint.
