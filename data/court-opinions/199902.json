Aguilo-Velez, and Schuster, Usera, Aguilo &\nSantiago were on brief, for appellants.\n     Jorge Carazo-Quetglas, with whom Toledo Toledo & Carazo-\nQuetglas, P.S.C. was on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                         April 1, 2002\n\f            COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge. Plaintiffs-appellees are\n\nformer   employees      of    Lep   Profit      International,      Inc.    (“Lep\n\nProfit”), which had been sold and became Geologistics Americas,\n\nInc. (“Geologistics”).           They brought suit in the Puerto Rico\n\nCourt of First Instance charging that Geologistics, Caribbean\n\nTransportation Services, Inc. (“Caribbean”), Federal Express\n\nCorporation (“FedEx”), Teamsters Union of Puerto Rico, Local 901\n\n(“Union”),    and   José      Cádiz,    an    official   of   the   union,    had\n\nterminated their employment in violation of their collective\n\nbargaining    agreement       (\"CBA\")    and   had   interfered     with    their\n\ncontractual rights.          No law, federal or Puerto Rican, was cited\n\nin the complaint; the only reference was to “the applicable\n\nlabor laws.”    Defendants were successful in removing the case to\n\nfederal district court, the court agreeing that the complaint in\n\nsubstance     alleged   violations       of    Section   301   of     the   Labor\n\nManagement Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. § 185, Section 9 of the\n\nNational Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. § 159, the Railway Labor\n\nAct, 45 U.S.C. § 151, and Puerto Rican contract and tort law.\n\n            Defendants then moved to dismiss the complaint on\n\nstatute of limitations grounds, arguing that the complaint,\n\nwhich charged the defendant companies with breaching the CBA and\n\nthe   union    defendants       with    breaching     their    duty    of    fair\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\frepresentation,        constituted     a     hybrid     Section     301/fair\n\nrepresentation suit.       Accordingly, the appropriate limitations\n\nperiod, under DelCostello v. Int’l Bhd. of Teamsters, 462 U.S.\n\n151 (1983), was six months.          The CBA had a termination date of\n\nJanuary 7, 1999.       Any dismissals in violation of the CBA had to\n\nhave occurred prior to that.          And, since the complaint had not\n\nbeen   filed   until    one    and   three   quarters    years     later,    on\n\nSeptember 1, 2000, defendants argued that the suit was untimely.\n\n            Plaintiffs responded, not contesting that the complaint\n\ncontained a time-barred hybrid claim, but instead urging that\n\nthere were several unidentified state causes of action.                 They\n\nasked the court to retain supplemental jurisdiction or remand\n\nthe case to the Puerto Rican court.             Defendants opposed both\n\nrequests,    arguing    that   the   facts   alleged    in   the   complaint\n\ndescribed a matter completely preempted by federal law.                     The\n\ndistrict court dismissed the federal claims as time-barred,\n\ndeclined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state\n\nlaw claims, and remanded the case to the Puerto Rico Court of\n\nFirst Instance without reaching the issue of preemption.                     It\n\nsubsequently    denied     without    comment    defendants’       motion    to\n\nreconsider.    The defendants appealed.\n\n            The substantive issue before us on appeal is whether\n\nany state claims contained in the complaint survive the powerful\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fpreemptive    force    behind    Section          301    and   the    allied   fair\n\nrepresentation provisions of the National Labor Relations Act.\n\nAs the Supreme Court has noted:\n\n            [T]he pre-emptive force of § 301 is so\n            powerful as to displace entirely any state\n            cause of action “for violation of contracts\n            between    an   employer    and   a    labor\n            organization.”   Any such suit is purely a\n            creature of federal law, notwithstanding the\n            fact that state law would provide a cause of\n            action in absence of § 301.\n\nCaterpillar, Inc. v. Williams, 482 U.S. 386, 393 (1987) (quoting\n\nFranchise Tax Bd. v. Constr. Laborers Vacation Trust, 463 U.S.\n\n1, 23 (1983)).\n\n            In BIW Deceived v. Local S6, 132 F.3d 824, 831 (1st\n\nCir.     1997),   we   noted    that    duty        of    fair    representation\n\n\"preemption operates in much the same fashion as section 301\n\npreemption.”      And in Magerer v. John Sexton & Co., 912 F.2d 525,\n\n531 (1st Cir. 1990), we applied the same test to state claims of\n\ntortious interference with contractual relations.\n\n            The Court has also laid down guidelines for determining\n\nwhen complete preemption is triggered.                  In Caterpillar, 482 U.S.\n\nat 394, it said, “Section 301 governs claims founded directly on\n\nrights created by collective bargaining agreements and also\n\nclaims    substantially   dependent          on   analysis       of   a   collective\n\nbargaining agreement.”         Moreover, it held that\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f          [o]nce an area of state law has been\n          completely pre-empted, any claim purportedly\n          based on that pre-empted state law is\n          considered, from its inception, a federal\n          claim, and therefore arises under federal\n          law. . . . The complete pre-emption\n          corollary to the well-pleaded complaint rule\n          is applied primarily in cases raising claims\n          pre-empted by § 301 of the LMRA.\n\nId. at 393; see also Beidleman v. The Stroh Brewery Co., 182\n\nF.3d 225, 237 (3d Cir. 1999).\n\n          If, then, the state claims are completely preempted by\n\nfederal law and no cause of action survives for consideration by\n\nthe Commonwealth court, remand to that court would be improper.\n\nSee St. John v. Int’l Ass’n of Machinists and Aerospace Workers,\n\n139 F.3d 1214, 1218 (8th Cir. 1998).          The task before us is to\n\nreview the arguments of plaintiffs-appellees in the light of the\n\nallegations of the complaint to see whether any state law claims\n\nare founded on the CBA or involve interpretation of the CBA.\n\n          Appellees advance four propositions.         Each deals with\n\na   separate   basis   for   avoidance   of   preemption.   The   first\n\nconcerns a state claim of tortious interference with contractual\n\nrelationships.    This claim is leveled at Caribbean and FedEx.\n\nIn their brief, appellees describe Caribbean and FedEx as third\n\nparties, not parties to the CBA, who carried out a deliberate\n\nstrategy to terminate plaintiffs’ employment so that, after such\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\ftermination, they could accomplish the sale of Lep Profit’s\n\nassets to themselves.\n\n             Whatever might be the preemption survival potential of\n\nsuch a claim, it bears no resemblance to what appears in the\n\ncomplaint.      In    the   complaint,        there    is    no   allegation      that\n\nCaribbean and FedEx engaged in any action before they became, as\n\nsuccessors to Lep Profit, parties to the CBA.                     On the contrary,\n\nparagraphs 40, 41, and 42 link together Geologistics, Caribbean,\n\nand FedEx as having acquired Lep Profit’s assets and liabilities\n\nand     as   having    assumed    all     of    Lep     Profit’s        contractual\n\nobligations.        Furthermore, in paragraph 44 it is specifically\n\nalleged that all three successors violated the CBA at the time\n\nof the termination of plaintiffs’ employment.\n\n             At oral argument, appellees’ counsel, confronted with\n\nthe allegations of the complaint, said that the complaint must\n\nbe read liberally, that there may be other information in the\n\nbackground, and that there had been no discovery.                       But this is\n\nnot a situation where only minor facts or inferences need be\n\nsupplied.       A   “liberal”    reading       would    in    effect    substitute\n\nentirely     different      allegations.          As    for       the   absence    of\n\ndiscovery, we note that no Rule 56(f) request for additional\n\ntime in which to conduct necessary discovery seems to have been\n\nmade.\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\f          Appellees’ second claim is directed at Geologistics,\n\nalleging the breach of an agreement wholly independent of the\n\nCBA: a letter to employees dated August 27, 1998.                 In paragraph\n\n34 of the complaint, this letter is alleged to have announced a\n\nname change, from \"Lep Profit International\" to \"Geologistics\n\nAmericas, Inc.,\" and to have added that this was only a change\n\nin the name and that “the continuity of the acquired rights was\n\nguaranteed.” How such a unilateral, gratuitous, unbargained-for\n\nmessage, confirmatory of and founded on CBA rights, can be\n\nconsidered an independent agreement sufficient to escape Section\n\n301 preemption escapes us.\n\n          Appellees’    third    claim    is   directed      at    the   union.\n\nParagraphs 35 and 36 allege that on September 15, 1998, it\n\nentered into a “Closing Agreement” with Lep Profit, which “was\n\nmeant to leave without effect” the CBA.            It seems unarguable to\n\nus that such a claim would necessarily involve ascertaining what\n\nrights the CBA had contained in order to know how the Closing\n\nAgreement had compromised them or rendered them to no effect.\n\nAppellees’ only rejoinder is to cite a Puerto Rico Supreme Court\n\ncase, Rivera v. Security Nat. Life Ins. Co., 106 D.P.R. 517\n\n(1977).   The   issue   there     was    whether    Puerto        Rico   had    an\n\nappropriate   compensatory      remedy   in    place   to    supplement        the\n\nremedy expressly provided by the federal law.               The Rivera court\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fmerely assumed for argument’s sake the permissibility of such a\n\nstate law remedy, but it found no such remedy in place.                   It\n\ntherefore made no decision as to whether federal preemption\n\nwould apply in a proper case.\n\n         Finally, appellees claim that they are entitled to\n\nseverance pay in accordance with Law 80 of May 30, 1976, 29 P.R.\n\nLaws Ann. § 185.     This law mandates some compensation in the\n\nevent of employment termination \"without just cause.\"                   But a\n\ndetermination of just cause presupposes an analysis of the\n\nrights and duties imposed by the CBA.            Moreover, even in the\n\nevent that a termination found not to be in violation of the CBA\n\ncould otherwise be adjudged without just cause under Law 80, the\n\nuncertainty caused by the application of two systems of law\n\nwould    undermine    the    policy   of    uniformity       in   labor   law\n\nadministration.      See    Beidleman,     182   F.3d   at    231-32.     We\n\ntherefore hold that all claims in the complaint are preempted by\n\nfederal labor law.\n\n         The district court’s order remanding the state law\n\nclaims is vacated.    The district court shall enter judgment for\n\nthe defendants on all claims asserted in the complaint.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\f",

(\"Caribbean\"), Federal Express Corporation (\"FedEx\"), Teamsters Union of Puerto Rico, Local 901 (\"Union\"), and Jos&#233; C&#225;diz, an official of the union, had terminated their employment in violation of their collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\") and had interfered with their contractual rights. No law, federal or Puerto Rican, was cited in the complaint; the only reference was to \"the applicable labor laws.\" Defendants were successful in removing the case to federal district court, the court agreeing that the complaint in substance alleged violations of Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 185, Section 9 of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 159, the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. &#167; 151, and Puerto Rican contract and tort law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants then moved to dismiss the complaint on statute of limitations grounds, arguing that the complaint, which charged the defendant companies with breaching the CBA and the union defendants with breaching their duty of fair representation, constituted a hybrid Section 301/fair representation suit.

In paragraph 34 of the complaint, this letter is alleged to have announced a name change, from \"Lep Profit International\" to \"Geologistics Americas, Inc.,\" and to have added that this was only a change in the name and that \"the continuity of the acquired rights was guaranteed.\" How such a unilateral, gratuitous, unbargained-for message, confirmatory of and founded on CBA rights, can be considered an independent agreement sufficient to escape Section 301 preemption escapes us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees' third claim is directed at the union. Paragraphs 35 and 36 allege that on September 15, 1998, it entered into a \"Closing Agreement\" with Lep Profit, which \"was meant to leave without effect\" the CBA. It seems unarguable to us that such a claim would necessarily involve ascertaining what rights the CBA had contained in order to know how the Closing Agreement had compromised them or rendered them to no effect. Appellees' only rejoinder is to cite a Puerto Rico Supreme Court case, <i>Rivera v. Security Nat. Life Ins. Co.,</i> 106 D.P.R. 517 (1977). The issue there was whether Puerto Rico had an appropriate compensatory remedy in place to supplement the remedy expressly provided by the federal law. The <i>Rivera</i> court merely assumed for argument's sake the permissibility of such a state law remedy, but it found no such remedy in place. It therefore made no decision as to whether federal preemption would apply in a proper case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, appellees claim that they are entitled to severance pay in accordance with Law 80 of May 30, 1976, 29 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 185. This law mandates some compensation in the event of employment termination \"without just cause.\" But a determination of just cause presupposes an analysis of the rights and duties imposed by the CBA. Moreover, even in the event that a termination found not to be in violation of the CBA could otherwise be adjudged without just cause under Law 80, the uncertainty caused by the application of two systems of law would undermine the policy of uniformity in labor law administration. <i>See Beidleman,</i> 182 F.3d at 231-32. We therefore hold that all claims in the complaint are preempted by federal labor law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>The district court's order remanding the state law claims is vacated.

(\"Lep Profit\"), which had been sold and became Geologistics Americas, Inc. (\"Geologistics\"). They brought suit in the Puerto Rico Court of First Instance charging that Geologistics, Caribbean Transportation Services, Inc. (\"Caribbean\"), Federal Express Corporation (\"FedEx\"), Teamsters Union of Puerto Rico, Local 901 (\"Union\"), and Jos&#233; C&#225;diz, an official of the union, had terminated their employment in violation of their collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\") and had interfered with their contractual rights. No law, federal or Puerto Rican, was cited in the complaint; the only reference was to \"the applicable labor laws.\" Defendants were successful in removing the case to federal district court, the court agreeing that the complaint in substance alleged violations of Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 185, Section 9 of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 159, the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. &#167; 151, and Puerto Rican contract and tort law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants then moved to dismiss the complaint on statute of limitations grounds, arguing that the complaint, which charged the defendant companies with breaching the CBA and the union defendants with breaching their duty of fair representation, constituted a hybrid Section 301/fair representation suit. Accordingly, the appropriate limitations period, under <i>DelCostello v. Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110956\"><a href=\"/opinion/110956/delcostello-v-teamsters/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">151</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110956\"><a href=\"/opinion/110956/delcostello-v-teamsters/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Any dismissals in violation of the CBA had to have occurred prior to that. And, since the complaint had not been filed until one and three quarters years later, on September 1, 2000, defendants argued that the suit was untimely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs responded, not contesting that the complaint contained a time-barred hybrid claim, but instead urging that there were several unidentified state causes of action. They asked the court to retain supplemental jurisdiction or remand the case to the Puerto Rican court. Defendants opposed both requests, arguing that the facts alleged in the complaint described a matter completely preempted by federal law. The district court dismissed the federal claims as time-barred, declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims, and remanded the case to the Puerto Rico Court of First Instance without reaching the issue of preemption. It subsequently denied without comment defendants' motion to reconsider. The defendants appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The substantive issue before us on appeal is whether any state claims contained in the complaint survive the powerful preemptive force behind Section 301 and the allied fair representation provisions of the National Labor Relations Act. As the Supreme Court has noted:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he pre-emptive force of &#167; 301 is so powerful as to displace entirely any state cause of action \"for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization.\" Any such suit is purely a creature of federal law, notwithstanding the fact that state law would provide a cause of action in absence of &#167; 301.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Caterpillar, Inc. v.

The task before us is to review the arguments of plaintiffs-appellees in the light of the allegations of the complaint to see whether any state law claims are founded on the CBA or involve interpretation of the CBA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees advance four propositions. Each deals with a separate basis for avoidance of preemption. The first concerns a state claim of tortious interference with contractual relationships. This claim is leveled at Caribbean and FedEx. In their brief, appellees describe Caribbean and FedEx as third parties, not parties to the CBA, who carried out a deliberate strategy to terminate plaintiffs' employment so that, after such termination, they could accomplish the sale of Lep Profit's assets to themselves.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever might be the preemption survival potential of such a claim, it bears no resemblance to what appears in the complaint. In the complaint, there is no allegation that Caribbean and FedEx engaged in any action before they became, as successors to Lep Profit, parties to the CBA. On the contrary, paragraphs 40, 41, and 42 link together Geologistics, Caribbean, and FedEx as having acquired Lep Profit's assets and liabilities and as having assumed all of Lep Profit's contractual obligations. Furthermore, in paragraph 44 it is specifically alleged that all three successors violated the CBA at the time of the termination of plaintiffs' employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument, appellees' counsel, confronted with the allegations of the complaint, said that the complaint must be read liberally, that there may be other information in the background, and that there had been no discovery. But this is not a situation where only minor facts or inferences need be supplied. A \"liberal\" reading would in effect substitute entirely different allegations. As for the absence of discovery, we note that no Rule 56(f) request for additional time in which to conduct necessary discovery seems to have been made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees' second claim is directed at Geologistics, alleging the breach of an agreement wholly independent of the CBA: a letter to employees dated August 27, 1998. In paragraph 34 of the complaint, this letter is alleged to have announced a name change, from \"Lep Profit International\" to \"Geologistics Americas, Inc.,\" and to have added that this was only a change in the name and that \"the continuity of the acquired rights was guaranteed.\" How such a unilateral, gratuitous, unbargained-for message, confirmatory of and founded on CBA rights, can be considered an independent agreement sufficient to escape Section 301 preemption escapes us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees' third claim is directed at the union. Paragraphs 35 and 36 allege that on September 15, 1998, it entered into a \"Closing Agreement\" with Lep Profit, which \"was meant to leave without effect\" the CBA. It seems unarguable to us that such a claim would necessarily involve ascertaining what rights the CBA had contained in order to know how the Closing Agreement had compromised them or rendered them to no effect. Appellees' only rejoinder is to cite a Puerto Rico Supreme Court case, <i>Rivera v. Security Nat. Life Ins. Co.,</i> 106 D.P.R. 517 (1977).
