In this diversity jurisdiction case,\r\nplaintiff-appellant John Hardemon appeals from an adverse decision\r\nof a tribunal of the Boston Police Department (BPD).  Defendant-\r\nappellee is the City of Boston.  In order to understand the present\r\nposture of the case, it is necessary to follow its procedural path.\r\nIn October of 1988 Hardemon was a recruit police officer\r\nat the Boston Police Academy.  He was discharged from the academy\r\nbecause of unsatisfactory character and failure to adhere to the\r\nstandard of performance required of Boston Police officers. \r\nHardemon sued the City in January of 1989 in the Massachusetts\r\nSuperior Court alleging breach of contract, racial discrimination,\r\nlibel, reckless infliction of emotional distress, invasion of\r\nprivacy and due process violations by the BPD.  The case was\r\nremoved to the United States District Court for the District of\r\nMassachusetts in February, 1989.\r\nThe only claim left extant for trial was a denial of\r\nsubstantive due process because of the failure of the BPD to advise\r\nHardemon of his post-termination right to appeal.  All the other\r\nclaims were waived or found by the district court to be not\r\ntriable.\r\nIn July 1992, a jury found that Hardemon had not been\r\ninformed of his right to a post-termination appeal hearing.  The\r\ndistrict court then issued an order which in pertinent part states:\r\n  1.  That, within sixty days of the date of\r\nthis order, the City of Boston shall petition\r\nthe Massachusetts Criminal Justice Training\r\nCouncil to hold a hearing to consider:  (a)\r\nwhether Joseph Hardemon was properly\r\ndismissed; and (b) if so, whether he ought to\r\nbe reinstated at the first available\r\nopportunity.\r\n\nPursuant to the court's order a BPD disciplinary hearing\r\nwas held in February 1996 before a tribunal.  The tribunal decided\r\nthat the dismissal was justified and supported by a preponderance\r\nof the evidence.  Hardemon sought judicial review pursuant to Mass.\r\nGen. Laws ch. 249,  4 (West, 1988), which is entitled \"Action in\r\nthe nature of certiorari.\"  The parties agreed to have the matter\r\ntried before a magistrate judge.  She found that there was no legal\r\nerror in the tribunal's decision; an opinion issued on July 23,\r\n1997.\r\nPrior to her decision on the merits, the magistrate judge\r\ndenied the City's motion to dismiss for lack of federal\r\njurisdiction.\r\nThere are two issues before us:  jurisdiction, and\r\nwhether the BPD tribunal erred as a matter of law in not accepting\r\nas an exhibit a letter of recantation by the woman who brought the\r\ninitial complaint against Hardemon.\r\n                         Jurisdiction\r\nInitially we were tempted to bypass the jurisdictional\r\nissue because the City easily prevails on the merits.  See Rojas v.\r\nFitch, 127 F.3d 184, 187 (1st Cir. 1997), petition for cert. filed,\r\n(U.S. Mar. 18, 1998) (No. 97-1550); Institut Pasteur v. Cambridge\r\nBiotech Corp., 104 F.3d 489, 492 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 117 S.\r\nCt. 2511 (1997); Hachikian v. FDIC, 96 F.3d 502, 506 n.4 (1st Cir.\r\n1996); United States v. Parcel of Land with Bldg., App. and Imp.,\r\n928 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1991).  The Supreme Court, however, has\r\nrecently issued a decision in which a plurality disapproves such an\r\napproach.  See Steel Co. v. Citizens For A Better Environment, 118\r\nS. Ct. 1003, 1012 (1998).  The various opinions in the case, read\r\nas a whole, are not entirely clear as to whether (or to what\r\nextent) Steel Co. undermines our earlier practice.  In all events,\r\nhaving noted the red flag, we see no need in this case to test the\r\nouter limits of the Court's tolerance, and, thus, we turn to the\r\njurisdictional issue.  \r\nAt the outset we note that diversity of citizenship is\r\nnot questioned.  Hardemon was a resident of Baltimore, Maryland, at\r\nthe time the complaint was filed.  The focus of the City's attack\r\non jurisdiction is the \"amount in controversy.\"  The City argues\r\nthat Hardemon's affidavit filed in response to the City's motion to\r\ndismiss for lack of jurisdiction failed, as a matter of law, to\r\nestablish the requisite $50,000 amount in controversy.  The City\r\nargues that the district court erred in its reliance on Department\r\nof Recreation and Sports of Puerto Rico v. World Boxing Ass'n, 942\r\nF.2d 84 (1st Cir. 1991), for its finding that Hardemon's affidavit\r\nsufficed to meet the \"amount in controversy\" requirement.  (The\r\npresent requirement is $75,000; at the time the complaint was filed\r\nthe amount was $50,000.)\r\nWe reject this argument.  There is no doubt that the\r\namended complaint met the \"amount in controversy\" requirement.  The\r\npertinent paragraphs of the affidavit state:\r\n6.  As a result of the wrongful termination, I\r\nhave lost wages and fringe benefits, including\r\nbut not limited to vacation pay, medical\r\ninsurance coverage, tuition benefits and\r\nseparation benefits.\r\n\n7.  My recollection is that my monthly salary\r\nwas approximately $1,980 while I was at the\r\nAcademy.\r\n\n8.  It is my belief that if I had been\r\ngraduated from the Academy and had become a\r\nfull fledged police officer, that my salary\r\nwould have been increased substantially but\r\nthat in any event, I would have been earning\r\nno less than the $1,980 which I earned monthly\r\nwhile at the Academy.\r\n\n9.  Based on the itemized losses described\r\nabove, the total value of the financial loss\r\nincurred as a result of the termination,\r\nexceeds $50,000.\r\n\nWorld Boxing Ass'n, 942 F.2d 84, was an action for\r\ndeclaratory judgment.  We pointed out that in such an action the\r\namount in controversy is measured by the value of the object of the\r\nlitigation.  We held that, \"[t]he amounts actually mentioned in the\r\nrecord for airfares and hotel bills and for the services of a\r\nhandwriting expert   have nothing to do with the value of the right\r\nthe Commission is seeking to vindicate in this lawsuit.\"  Id. at\r\n88.\r\nThe instant case is not a declaratory judgment action. \r\nIt is an action alleging wrongful termination.  Secondly, the\r\nmagistrate judge did not cite to World Boxing Ass'n for the\r\nproposition that, \"Hardemon's affidavit alleging losses in backpay\r\nsatisfied his burden of demonstrating the requisite jurisdictional\r\namount.\"  City's Br. at 12.  We quote from the opinion below: \r\n  As a general matter, plaintiff's burden of\r\nproving it meets the required amount in\r\ncontroversy is satisfied by simply alleging\r\nthe amount in the complaint.  Dep't of\r\nRecreation &amp; Sports of Puerto Rico v. World\r\nBoxing Ass'n, 942 F.2d 84, 88 (1st Cir. 1991). \r\nHowever, there is long standing precedent that\r\nonce diversity jurisdiction has been\r\nchallenged, the burden shifts from merely\r\naverring the amount in controversy to\r\nsubstantiating the amount in controversy.  SeeGibbs v. Buck, 307 U.S. 66, 72 (1939);\r\nFrederick v. ConAgra, 713 F. Supp. 41, 47 (D.\r\nMass. 1989).  When faced with a motion to\r\ndismiss, plaintiff has the burden of proving\r\njurisdiction \"by showing that it does not\r\nappear to legal certainty that its claim is\r\nfor less than the jurisdictional amount.\" \r\nFrederick, 713 F. Supp. at 47.  Plaintiff may\r\nmeet this burden by amending the pleading or\r\nby submitting affidavits which sufficiently\r\nsubstantiate the alleged amount in\r\ncontroversy.  Kenney v. Hoover, 909 F. Supp.\r\n34, 36 (D.Mass. 1995).\r\n\n(Emphasis added.)\r\n\nWorld Boxing Ass'n was cited only for the proposition\r\nthat the \"amount in controversy\" may be satisfied by alleging it in\r\nthe complaint.  It was not the court below that erred in relying on\r\nWorld Boxing Ass'n but counsel for the City who misread the\r\ndistrict court's opinion.  This error is compounded by the City's\r\nconversion of a statement in a declaratory judgment case about the\r\nvalue of the right sought into a general diversity rule that what\r\nmatters is the value of the right sought, not the amount of damages\r\nclaimed.  Based on this infirm premise the City argues that,\r\n\"Hardemon's allegation of loss of back pay had nothing to do with\r\nthe right he was seeking to vindicate in his complaint to the\r\ndistrict court, to wit, the right to clear his name.\"  City's Br.\r\nat 13.  But there is nothing in the complaint asserting Hardemon's\r\nright to clear his name.  Counts one through fourteen were factual\r\nassertions and background information.  There is no mention in any\r\nof these counts that Hardemon wanted to clear his name.  We quote\r\nthe balance of the complaint:\r\n15.  The actions of the Panel were arbitrary,\r\ncapricious, were not supported by substantial\r\nevidence and relied heavily on hearsay\r\nevidence which was not supported by competent\r\ncorroborative evidence.\r\n\n16.  The Panel did not have any written\r\nguidelines or objective criteria which would\r\nhave assisted it in reaching a fair and\r\nimpartial decision based on the evidence. \r\nInstead, the members of the Panel were\r\ninfluenced by bias in favour of the defendant,\r\nwhich is the employer of all of its members.\r\n\n17.  The decision does not reflect a careful\r\nand impartial weighing of the evidence and is \r\narbitrary, capricious and against the evidence\r\nand the substantial weight of the evidence.\r\n\n  WHEREFORE, plaintiff prays that an order\r\nissue from this Honorable Court to the\r\ndefendant City of Boston, directing it to\r\ncertify to this court, a true and complete and\r\nperfect record of all proceedings before the\r\nPanel, together with a transcript of the\r\nevidence and all exhibits and findings of fact\r\nmade by the Panel, to the end that any errors\r\nof law may be determined and corrected by this\r\ncourt and to enable the court to determine\r\nwhether the decision was warranted as a matter\r\nof law upon the evidence.\r\n\n  Plaintiff further prays that the decision of\r\nthe Panel and of the defendant City of Boston\r\nbe quashed and reversed, that this court order\r\nthe defendant to admit the plaintiff to the\r\nnext available training class at the Academy\r\nand grant such other and further relief as may\r\nappear equitable and appropriate.\r\n\nThe City cites to a case holding, inter alia, that \"a\r\nnonpermanent municipal employee is entitled to a termination\r\nhearing for the sole purpose of clearing his name and thereby\r\nrestoring his reputation.\"  Grant v. Police Comm'r of Boston, 387\r\nN.E.2d 178, 180 (Mass. App. Ct. 1979).  The quote by the City from\r\nGrant is taken out of context.  The pertinent part of the opinion\r\nreads as follows:\r\n  Termination alone is not sufficient basis\r\nfor a claim of a denial of due process\r\nrights. . . .  Due process affords protection\r\nagainst damage to a person's standing and\r\nassociations in the community, and against\r\nactions by an employer which foreclose\r\nemployment opportunities because these are\r\nliberty interests within the reach of the\r\nFourteenth Amendment. . . .  When these\r\nliberty interests have been violated, a\r\nnonpermanent municipal employee is entitled to\r\na termination hearing for the sole purpose of\r\nclearing his name and thereby restoring his\r\nreputation.  A violation occurs if an employer\r\n\"creates and disseminates a false and\r\ndefamatory impression about the employee in\r\nconnection with his termination . . . .\"  Coddv. Velger, 429 U.S. 624, 628, 97 S. Ct. 882,\r\n884, 51 L. Ed. 2d 92 (1977).  However, because\r\nof the limited purpose of the hearing to clear\r\none's name, it is a condition precedent to the\r\nhearing that the employee deny the charges. \r\n\"If he does not challenge the substantial\r\ntruth of the material in question, no hearing\r\nwould afford a promise of achieving that\r\nresult for him.\"  Codd, 429 U.S. at 627-28, 97\r\nS. Ct. at 884. . . .  The plaintiff's failure\r\nto challenge the charges suggests that he does\r\nnot claim that the defendant created false\r\ninformation.\r\n\n  Not only must there be a creation of false\r\ninformation by the employer, there also must\r\nbe a dissemination of that information by the\r\nemployer before there is a depreciation of an\r\nemployee's liberty interests. . . .  The\r\nprotection of liberty interests is violated\r\nneither by the presence of adverse information\r\nin a personnel file, standing alone . . . ,\r\nnor by an involuntary termination that has \r\nmade future employment difficult to obtain\r\n. . . .\r\n\nId. at 180 (citations omitted).\r\n\nThe analysis in Grant was based on a claim that the\r\ntermination at issue offended substantive due process because it\r\n\"damage[d] [Grant's] standing and associations in the community,\r\nand . . . foreclose[d] employment opportunities.\"  Id.  It was \r\n\"[w]hen these liberty interests have been violated,\" id., that \"a\r\nnonpermanent employee is entitled to a termination hearing for the\r\nsole purpose of clearing his name and thereby restoring his\r\nreputation,\" id.  Hardemon, however, alleged a procedural due\r\nprocess violation on the basis of the City's failure to inform him\r\nof his right to appeal the termination decision.  He was not\r\nseeking to clear his name on the basis of the liberty interests\r\nrecognized in Grant.  Grant is of no avail to the City.\r\nThere is an additional reason why Hardemon's affidavit\r\nrelying on back pay to meet the amount in controversy requirement\r\nwas sufficient.  After the jury verdict finding a substantive due\r\nprocess violation, the district court ordered the City to hold a\r\nhearing to consider whether Hardemon was properly dismissed \"and\r\n(b) if so, whether he ought to be reinstated at the first available\r\nopportunity.\"  Obviously, if Hardemon were reinstated he would be\r\nentitled to back pay.\r\nWe affirm the holding of the district court that\r\nHardemon's affidavit sufficed to meet \"the amount in controversy\"\r\njurisdictional requirement.\r\nIn the district court, the City argued that a state\r\nstatute vesting jurisdiction in the Massachusetts Superior Court of\r\nthis type of action precluded federal jurisdiction.  The City has\r\nwisely decided not to pursue this challenge on appeal.\r\n                          The Merits\r\nThe only substantive issue before us is whether it was\r\nlegal error for the BPD tribunal to refuse to accept as an exhibit\r\na recantation letter from Agnes Cansler dated August 31, 1990, and\r\nwhether such refusal resulted in substantial prejudice to Hardemon. \r\nUnlike the district court we are not called upon to determine\r\nwhether the BPD tribunal's decision should be affirmed.  The\r\nmagistrate judge affirmed the tribunal's refusal to reinstate\r\nHardemon to the Boston Police Department, ruling that, \"there was\r\nno legal error in the Tribunal's decision.\"  Our focus is narrowed\r\nto the sole question of whether it was legal error for the BPD\r\ntribunal to refuse to admit the letter of recantation into\r\nevidence.  Hardemon's appeal is based solely on this issue.\r\nIn reviewing the tribunal opinion, the magistrate judge\r\nstated:\r\nMs. Cansler's letter was not admitted because\r\nits authentication was not established.4 \r\nFurther, there was no evidence that the letter\r\nwas ever received by the legal department of\r\nthe Boston Police and thus could not be\r\nconsidered during the investigation.\r\n\nThe footnote states:\r\n\n4  Plaintiff contends that Ms. Cansler's\r\nwhereabouts could not be determined at the\r\ntime of the hearing.\r\n\nThese rulings and findings, if so they be, are not given any\r\ndeference by us.\r\nThe relevant facts are as follows.  Close to midnight on\r\nJuly 11, 1988, Recruit Officer Hardemon went to a house in Jamaica\r\nPlain, Massachusetts, to support his friend Timothy Ellerbee in a\r\ndispute with in-laws.  The dispute degenerated into name-calling\r\nand rock throwing.  Agnes Cansler armed herself with a baseball bat\r\nto defend herself from the Ellerbees.  Hardemon took the baseball\r\nbat away from her.  On July 13, Agnes Cansler filed a complaint\r\nwith the police department, which stated: \r\n  About 7 p.m. there was a family dispute\r\ninvolving inlaws [sic] at the home of the\r\ncomplainant, which was responded to by Area E\r\nofficers.  As a result of that fight, Recruit\r\nOfficer Joe Hardemon, best friend of one of\r\nthe inlaws involved earlier, Tim Ellerbe, of\r\n2031 Columbus Ave., came to Ms. Cansler's home\r\nwith approximately 9 other B/Ms.  These young\r\nmen came to continue the fight started\r\nearlier.  After James Ellerbe (Tim's brother)\r\npushed and hit Ms. Cansler's mother, Thelma\r\nHarris, 61 years, Ms. Cansler picked up and\r\nwas swinging a bat in self-protection, but she\r\ndid not hit anyone with it.  Some members of\r\nthe group with Recruit Officer Hardemon were\r\nthrowing bottles.  Recruit Hardemon was\r\nencouraging the group to attack Ms. Cansler by\r\nshouting, \"Why don't you Bumrush her!!!\"  A\r\nneighbor called the police and several\r\nofficers from Area E responded.  A black\r\nofficer spoke with Recruit Hardemon and told\r\nhim that he would see him at the Academy.\r\n\n  Ms. Cansler feels that Recruit Hardemon\r\nshould not have joined into this family\r\nproblem and should definately [sic] not have\r\ntaken an active part in the fight, but, as a\r\npolice officer, should have tried to calm or\r\nprevent the incident. \r\n\n(Note:  as a result of this fight, Ms.\r\nCansler's daughter, Lasanya, 16 years,\r\nsustained a minor injury to her face.  This\r\nwas inflicted by James Ellerbe.)\r\n\nThe letter of recantation states:\r\n\nTo the Legal Department of Boston Police,\r\n  I, Agnes Cansler made a complaint about Joe \r\nHardemon on Boylston St. Jamaica Plain on\r\nJuly 12, 1988.  He was not involved in that\r\ndispute.  On 7-12-88 he was coming to visit my\r\nsister and I thought he was coming to cause\r\ntrouble with Timothy Ellerbee and Family\r\nbecause they were friends.\r\n\n  Someone in the crowd said Bumrush Agnes and\r\neverybody thought Joe said it but he didn't,\r\nit was one of the Ellerbees that said it.\r\n\n  I just want to inform you that we are still\r\nspeaking as friends and I think he would make\r\na good police officer.\r\n\n  If you have any questions you can call me at\r\n(617)282-5103.  The address is\r\n                   5 Greenmount St. #2\r\n                   Dor. MA  02125\r\n\n  Thank You.\r\n\n                   Agnes Cansler\r\n\nSergeant Devlin was assigned to investigate the matter. \r\nHe found that Hardemon lied about two matters concerning Hardemon's\r\nconduct prior to the incident itself.  The BPD tribunal found that\r\nthere was ample evidence that Hardemon had made untruthful\r\nstatements to Sergeant Devlin during the investigation.  The\r\ntribunal also concluded that Hardemon was improperly involved in an\r\naltercation involving family and friends.  Agnes Cansler is the\r\nsister of Cheryl Harris who had a relationship with Hardemon and\r\nwas the mother of his twin daughters.\r\nOur scope of review is restricted by the issue which was\r\nframed by Hardemon:  did the BPD tribunal commit legal error on\r\nexcluding the letter of recantation?  Mass.  Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 30,\r\n11(2) (West 1992) provides:\r\n  (2)  Unless otherwise provided by any law,\r\nagencies need not observe the rules of\r\nevidence observed by courts, but shall observe\r\nthe rules of privilege recognized by law. \r\nEvidence may be admitted and given probative\r\neffect only if it is the kind of evidence on\r\nwhich reasonable persons are accustomed to\r\nrely in the conduct of serious affairs. \r\nAgencies may exclude unduly repetitious\r\nevidence, whether offered on direct\r\nexamination or cross-examination of witnesses. \r\n(Emphasis added.)\r\n\nThe core finding of the BPD tribunal was:\r\n\n12.  Based on the findings and recommendations\r\nof the investigation, Mr. Hardemon was\r\nterminated from the Boston Police Department\r\non October 6, 1988 for becoming involved in a\r\nsituation involving family and friends\r\nregarding the events set forth in Complaint\r\n#4273, for untruthfulness relative to his\r\nparticipation in the investigation of those\r\nevents, and for conduct unbecoming a police\r\nofficer in reference to the two aforementioned\r\ncharges.\r\n\nWe agree with Hardemon that the Chief Hearing Officer\r\nexcluded the exculpatory letter at the hearing on the grounds of\r\nrelevance.  The BPD tribunal later gave the following reasons in\r\nwriting for excluding the letter:\r\n  First, Ms. Cansler's letter was not admitted\r\ninto evidence because its authenticity could\r\nnot be established.  Furthermore, there is no\r\nproof that the addressee, the Legal Department\r\nof the Boston Police ever received it.  In\r\nfact, when Captain Dunford was presented with\r\nthe letter on the witness stand, he stated\r\nthat he had never seen it before.\r\n\nWe do not agree with Hardemon that the letter was\r\nrelevant.  The letter had no bearing on the findings by Sergeant\r\nDevlin that Hardemon had lied to Devlin during the investigation of\r\nHardemon's conduct on the day of the incident.  Nor did the letter\r\nstate that Hardemon was not present during the altercation at\r\nJamaica Plain.  As the City correctly points out, \"[t]he issue at\r\nthe hearing was whether Hardemon was properly terminated based on\r\nthe findings from that investigation, not from the allegations by\r\nAgnes Cansler.\"  City's Br. at 17 (emphasis added).  The letter was\r\ntangential at best to the determination that the tribunal was\r\nmaking.\r\nBut even if the letter was somehow relevant, it was\r\nworthless as evidence.  A comparison between the complaint process\r\nand the letter makes this clear.  After she filed the complaint,\r\nMs. Cansler was questioned by the investigating police officer\r\nabout its contents.  The subsequent recantation letter did not give\r\nthe investigators any opportunity to probe her new allegations. \r\nThey could not ask her in particular why she had originally made a\r\npolice complaint that she now claims was wholly false, or why her\r\ncurrent version of events is any more likely to be true.  The\r\nletter was simply unreliable; it was not \"the kind of evidence on\r\nwhich reasonable persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of\r\nserious affairs.\"  Mass Gen. Laws Ann. ch 30,  11(2). \r\nThere appears to have been no effort made to have Agnes\r\nCansler testify at the hearing or to take her deposition for use at\r\nthe hearing.\r\nWe rule that it was not legal error for the BPD tribunal\r\nto exclude the recantation letter from evidence.\r\nJudgment for the defendant.  No costs for either party.\r\n                - Concurring Opinion Follows -\r\nBOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge (concurring).  I write\r\nseparately because I think that the court has brushed aside the\r\nholding of Steel Co. v. Citizens For A Better Environment, 118 S.\r\nCt. 1003 (1998), and its effect on our approach to difficult\r\njurisdictional issues in the future.  The panel says that it is\r\n\"not entirely clear as to whether (or to what extent) Steel Co.undermines our earlier practice.\"  It is entirely clear to me that\r\nthe Court has generally prohibited our prior practice of avoiding\r\ndifficult jurisdictional issues when the case could alternatively\r\nbe resolved easily on the merits in favor of the same party.\r\nA full understanding of the Court's view on this issue\r\nrequires a close reading of Justice O'Connor's concurrence, as well\r\nas Justice Scalia's majority opinion.  \r\nIn its majority opinion, the Court noted that several\r\ncourts of appeals \r\nfind it proper to proceed immediately to the\r\nmerits question, despite jurisdictional\r\nobjections, at least where (1) the merits\r\nquestion is more readily resolved, and (2) the\r\nprevailing party on the merits would be the\r\nsame as the prevailing party were jurisdiction\r\ndenied. . . .\r\n\n  We decline to endorse such an approach\r\nbecause it carries the courts beyond the\r\nbounds of authorized judicial action and thus\r\noffends fundamental principles of separation\r\nof powers.\r\n\n118 S. Ct. at 1012 (citations and footnote omitted).\r\nJustice O'Connor, joined by Justice Kennedy, made it\r\nclear that she joined the majority opinion, and that she explicitly\r\n\"agree[d]\" with the general rule that \"federal courts should be\r\ncertain of their jurisdiction before reaching the merits of a\r\ncase.\"  Id. at 1020 (emphasis added).  But then she went on to\r\nnote, \"[a]s the Court acknowledges, . . . several . . . decisions\r\n'have diluted the absolute purity of the rule that Article III\r\njurisdiction is always an antecedent question.'\"  Id. (quoting id.at 1016).  Finally, Justice O'Connor explained that she was writing\r\nseparately \"to note that, in [her] view, the Court's opinion should\r\nnot be read as cataloging an exhaustive list of circumstances under\r\nwhich federal courts may exercise judgment in 'reserv[ing]\r\ndifficult questions of . . . jurisdiction when the case\r\nalternatively could be resolved on the merits in favor of the same\r\nparty.'\"  Id. (quoting Norton v. Matthews, 427 U.S. 524, 532\r\n(1976)).  \r\nReading the majority and concurring opinions in Steel Co.together, there is a Supreme Court majority in support of the\r\ngeneral rule that \"federal courts should be certain of their\r\njurisdiction before reaching the merits of a case.\"  Id. at 1020\r\n(O'Connor, J., concurring); see id. at 1012, 1016 (majority\r\nopinion).  While this general rule is perhaps not \"absolute[ly]\r\npur[e],\" the circumstances that would warrant an exception to the\r\nrule seem extremely rare.  See Steel Co., 118 S. Ct. at 1014-15\r\n(majority opinion); id. at 1020 (O'Connor, J., concurring). It\r\nappears that Justices O'Connor and Kennedy would dilute the general\r\nrule only to the extent that they believe the cases discussed in\r\nthe majority opinion, id. at 1014-15, do not exhaust the rare\r\ncircumstances in which an exception would be appropriate, id. at\r\n1020. \r\nI do not know what the panel expects to achieve by\r\ncasting doubt on the holding and effect of Steel Co.  As Court of\r\nAppeals judges we have a duty to follow it, not avoid it.\n",

Defendant-appellee is the City of Boston.  In order to understand the present posture of the case, it is necessary to follow its procedural path.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October of 1988 Hardemon was a recruit police officer at the Boston Police Academy.  He was discharged from the academy because of unsatisfactory character and failure to adhere to the standard of performance required of Boston Police officers.  Hardemon sued the City in January of 1989 in the Massachusetts Superior Court alleging breach of contract, racial discrimination, libel, reckless infliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy and due process violations by the BPD. The case was removed to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts in February, 1989.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only claim left extant for trial was a denial of substantive due process because of the failure of the BPD to advise Hardemon of his post-termination right to appeal.  All the other claims were waived or found by the district court to be not triable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1992, a jury found that Hardemon had not been informed of his right to a post-termination appeal hearing.  The district court then issued an order which in pertinent part states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.  That, within sixty days of the date of this order, the City of Boston shall petition the Massachusetts Criminal Justice Training Council to hold a hearing to consider:  (a) whether Joseph Hardemon was properly dismissed;  and (b) if so, whether he ought to be reinstated at the first available opportunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to the court's order a BPD disciplinary hearing was held in February 1996 before a tribunal.  The tribunal decided that the dismissal was justified and supported by a preponderance of the evidence.  Hardemon sought judicial review pursuant to Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 249, &#167; 4 (West, 1988), which is entitled \"Action in the nature of certiorari.\"   The parties agreed to have the matter tried before a magistrate judge.  She found that there was no legal error in the tribunal's decision;  an opinion issued on July 23, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to her decision on the merits, the magistrate judge denied the City's motion to dismiss for lack of federal jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two issues before us:  jurisdiction, and whether the BPD tribunal erred as a matter of law in not accepting as an exhibit a letter of recantation by the woman who brought the initial complaint against Hardemon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Jurisdiction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Initially we were tempted to bypass the jurisdictional issue because the City easily prevails on the merits.  See Rojas v. Fitch, 127 F.3d 184, 187 (1st Cir.1997), petition for cert. filed, (U.S. Mar. 18, 1998) (No. 97-1550);  Institut Pasteur v. Cambridge Biotech Corp., 104 F.3d 489, 492 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 2511, 138 L.Ed.2d 1014 (1997);  Hachikian v. FDIC, 96 F.3d 502, 506 n. 4 (1st Cir.1996);  United States v. Parcel of Land with Bldg., App. and Imp., 928 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1991).  The Supreme Court, however, has recently issued a decision in which a plurality disapproves such an approach.  See Steel Co. v. Citizens For A Better Environment, --- U.S. ----, ----, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 1012, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998).  The various opinions in the case, read as a whole, are not entirely clear as to whether (or to what extent) Steel Co. undermines our earlier practice.  In all events, having noted the red flag, we see no need in this case to test the outer limits of the Court's tolerance, and, thus, we turn to the jurisdictional issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset we note that diversity of citizenship is not questioned.  Hardemon was a resident of Baltimore, Maryland, at the time the complaint was filed.  The focus of the City's attack on jurisdiction is the \"amount in controversy.\"   The City argues that Hardemon's affidavit filed in response to the City's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction failed, as a matter of law, to establish the requisite $50,000 amount in controversy.  The City argues that the district court erred in its reliance on Department of Recreation and Sports of Puerto Rico v. World Boxing Ass'n, 942 F.2d 84 (1st Cir.1991), for its finding that Hardemon's affidavit sufficed to meet the \"amount in controversy\" requirement.  (The present requirement is $75,000;  at the time the complaint was filed the amount was $50,000.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject this argument.  There is no doubt that the amended complaint met the \"amount in controversy\" requirement.  The pertinent paragraphs of the affidavit state:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>6.  As a result of the wrongful termination, I have lost wages and fringe benefits, including but not limited to vacation pay, medical insurance coverage, tuition benefits and separation benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>7. My recollection is that my monthly salary was approximately $1,980 while I was at the Academy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>8. It is my belief that if I had been graduated from the Academy and had become a full fledged police officer, that my salary would have been increased substantially but that in any event, I would have been earning no less than the $1,980 which I earned monthly while at the Academy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>9. Based on the itemized losses described above, the total value of the financial loss incurred as a result of the termination, exceeds $50,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">World Boxing Ass'n, 942 F.2d 84, was an action for declaratory judgment.  We pointed out that in such an action the amount in controversy is measured by the value of the object of the litigation.  We held that, \"[t]he amounts actually mentioned in the record for airfares and hotel bills and for the services of a handwriting expert--have nothing to do with the value of the right the Commission is seeking to vindicate in this lawsuit.\"  Id. at 88.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The instant case is not a declaratory judgment action.  It is an action alleging wrongful termination.  Secondly, the magistrate judge did not cite to World Boxing Ass'n for the proposition that, \"Hardemon's affidavit alleging losses in backpay satisfied his burden of demonstrating the requisite jurisdictional amount.\"   City's Br. at 12.  We quote from the opinion below:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a general matter, plaintiff's burden of proving it meets the required amount in controversy is satisfied by simply alleging the amount in the complaint.  Dep't of Recreation &amp; Sports of Puerto Rico v. World Boxing Ass'n, 942 F.2d 84, 88 (1st Cir.1991).  However, there is long standing precedent that once diversity jurisdiction has been challenged, the burden shifts from merely averring the amount in controversy to substantiating the amount in controversy.  See Gibbs v. Buck, 307 U.S. 66, 72, 59 S.Ct. 725, 729, 83 L.Ed. 1111 (1939);  Frederick v. ConAgra, 713 F.Supp. 41, 47 (D.Mass.1989).  When faced with a motion to dismiss, plaintiff has the burden of proving jurisdiction \"by showing that it does not appear to legal certainty that its claim is for less than the jurisdictional amount.\"  Frederick, 713 F.Supp. at 47.   Plaintiff may meet this burden by amending the pleading or by submitting affidavits which sufficiently substantiate the alleged amount in controversy.  Kenney v. Hoover, 909 F.Supp. 34, 36 (D.Mass.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">World Boxing Ass'n was cited only for the proposition that the \"amount in controversy\" may be satisfied by alleging it in the complaint.  It was not the court below that erred in relying on World Boxing Ass'n but counsel for the City who misread the district court's opinion.  This error is compounded by the City's conversion of a statement in a declaratory judgment case about the value of the right sought into a general diversity rule that what matters is the value of the right sought, not the amount of damages claimed.  Based on this infirm premise the City argues that, \"Hardemon's allegation of loss of back pay had nothing to do with the right he was seeking to vindicate in his complaint to the district court, to wit, the right to clear his name.\"   City's Br. at 13.  But there is nothing in the complaint asserting Hardemon's right to clear his name.  Counts one through fourteen were factual assertions and background information.  There is no mention in any of these counts that Hardemon wanted to clear his name.  We quote the balance of the complaint:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>15.  The actions of the Panel were arbitrary, capricious, were not supported by substantial evidence and relied heavily on hearsay evidence which was not supported by competent corroborative evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>16. The Panel did not have any written guidelines or objective criteria which would have assisted it in reaching a fair and impartial decision based on the evidence.  Instead, the members of the Panel were influenced by bias in favour of the defendant, which is the employer of all of its members.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>17. The decision does not reflect a careful and impartial weighing of the evidence and is arbitrary, capricious and against the evidence and the substantial weight of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">WHEREFORE, plaintiff prays that an order issue from this Honorable Court to the defendant City of Boston, directing it to certify to this court, a true and complete and perfect record of all proceedings before the Panel, together with a transcript of the evidence and all exhibits and findings of fact made by the Panel, to the end that any errors of law may be determined and corrected by this court and to enable the court to determine whether the decision was warranted as a matter of law upon the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff further prays that the decision of the Panel and of the defendant City of Boston be quashed and reversed, that this court order the defendant to admit the plaintiff to the next available training class at the Academy and grant such other and further relief as may appear equitable and appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City cites to a case holding, inter alia, that \"a nonpermanent municipal employee is entitled to a termination hearing for the sole purpose of clearing his name and thereby restoring his reputation.\"  Grant v. Police Comm'r of Boston, 7 Mass.App.Ct. 296, 387 N.E.2d 178, 180 (1979).  The quote by the City from Grant is taken out of context.  The pertinent part of the opinion reads as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Termination alone is not sufficient basis for a claim of a denial of due process rights....  Due process affords protection against damage to a person's standing and associations in the community, and against actions by an employer which foreclose employment opportunities because these are liberty interests within the reach of the Fourteenth Amendment....  When these liberty interests have been violated, a nonpermanent municipal employee is entitled to a termination hearing for the sole purpose of clearing his name and thereby restoring his reputation.  A violation occurs if an employer \"creates and disseminates a false and defamatory impression about the employee in connection with his termination....\"  Codd v. Velger, 429 U.S. 624, 628, 97 S.Ct. 882, 884, 51 L.Ed.2d 92 (1977).  However, because of the limited purpose of the hearing to clear one's name, it is a condition precedent to the hearing that the employee deny the charges.  \"If he does not challenge the substantial truth of the material in question, no hearing would afford a promise of achieving that result for him.\"  Codd, 429 U.S. at 627-28, 97 S.Ct. at 884....  The plaintiff's failure to challenge the charges suggests that he does not claim that the defendant created false information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not only must there be a creation of false information by the employer, there also must be a dissemination of that information by the employer before there is a depreciation of an employee's liberty interests....  The protection of liberty interests is violated neither by the presence of adverse information in a personnel file, standing alone ..., nor by an involuntary termination that has made future employment difficult to obtain....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id., 387 N.E.2d at 180 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The analysis in Grant was based on a claim that the termination at issue offended substantive due process because it \"damage[d] [Grant's] standing and associations in the community, and ... foreclose[d] employment opportunities.\"  Id. It was \"[w]hen these liberty interests have been violated,\" id., that \"a nonpermanent employee is entitled to a termination hearing for the sole purpose of clearing his name and thereby restoring his reputation,\" id.   Hardemon, however, alleged a procedural due process violation on the basis of the City's failure to inform him of his right to appeal the termination decision.  He was not seeking to clear his name on the basis of the liberty interests recognized in Grant.  Grant is of no avail to the City.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is an additional reason why Hardemon's affidavit relying on back pay to meet the amount in controversy requirement was sufficient.  After the jury verdict finding a substantive due process violation, the district court ordered the City to hold a hearing to consider whether Hardemon was properly dismissed \"and (b) if so, whether he ought to be reinstated at the first available opportunity.\"   Obviously, if Hardemon were reinstated he would be entitled to back pay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the holding of the district court that Hardemon's affidavit sufficed to meet \"the amount in controversy\" jurisdictional requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the district court, the City argued that a state statute vesting jurisdiction in the Massachusetts Superior Court of this type of action precluded federal jurisdiction.  The City has wisely decided not to pursue this challenge on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Merits</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only substantive issue before us is whether it was legal error for the BPD tribunal to refuse to accept as an exhibit a recantation letter from Agnes Cansler dated August 31, 1990, and whether such refusal resulted in substantial prejudice to Hardemon.  Unlike the district court we are not called upon to determine whether the BPD tribunal's decision should be affirmed.  The magistrate judge affirmed the tribunal's refusal to reinstate Hardemon to the Boston Police Department, ruling that, \"there was no legal error in the Tribunal's decision.\"   Our focus is narrowed to the sole question of whether it was legal error for the BPD tribunal to refuse to admit the letter of recantation into evidence.  Hardemon's appeal is based solely on this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing the tribunal opinion, the magistrate judge stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>Ms. Cansler's letter was not admitted because its authentication was not established.4 Further, there was no evidence that the letter was ever received by the legal department of the Boston Police and thus could not be considered during the investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The footnote states:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>4 Plaintiff contends that Ms. Cansler's whereabouts could not be determined at the time of the hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These rulings and findings, if so they be, are not given any deference by us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevant facts are as follows.  Close to midnight on July 11, 1988, Recruit Officer Hardemon went to a house in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, to support his friend Timothy Ellerbee in a dispute with in-laws.  The dispute degenerated into name-calling and rock throwing.  Agnes Cansler armed herself with a baseball bat to defend herself from the Ellerbees.  Hardemon took the baseball bat away from her.  On July 13, Agnes Cansler filed a complaint with the police department, which stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About 7 p.m. there was a family dispute involving inlaws [sic] at the home of the complainant, which was responded to by Area E officers.  As a result of that fight, Recruit Officer Joe Hardemon, best friend of one of the inlaws involved earlier, Tim Ellerbe, of 2031 Columbus Ave., came to Ms. Cansler's home with approximately 9 other B/Ms.  These young men came to continue the fight started earlier.  After James Ellerbe (Tim's brother) pushed and hit Ms. Cansler's mother, Thelma Harris, 61 years, Ms. Cansler picked up and was swinging a bat in self-protection, but she did not hit anyone with it.  Some members of the group with Recruit Officer Hardemon were throwing bottles.  Recruit Hardemon was encouraging the group to attack Ms. Cansler by shouting, \"Why don't you Bumrush her!!!\"    A neighbor called the police and several officers from Area E responded.  A black officer spoke with Recruit Hardemon and told him that he would see him at the Academy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ms. Cansler feels that Recruit Hardemon should not have joined into this family problem and should definately [sic] not have taken an active part in the fight, but, as a police officer, should have tried to calm or prevent the incident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p>(Note:  as a result of this fight, Ms. Cansler's daughter, Lasanya, 16 years, sustained a minor injury to her face.  This was inflicted by James Ellerbe.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The letter of recantation states:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p>To the Legal Department of Boston Police,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I, Agnes Cansler made a complaint about Joe Hardemon on Boylston St. Jamaica Plain on July 12, 1988.

He found that Hardemon lied about two matters concerning Hardemon's conduct prior to the incident itself.  The BPD tribunal found that there was ample evidence that Hardemon had made untruthful statements to Sergeant Devlin during the investigation.  The tribunal also concluded that Hardemon was improperly involved in an altercation involving family and friends.  Agnes Cansler is the sister of Cheryl Harris who had a relationship with Hardemon and was the mother of his twin daughters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our scope of review is restricted by the issue which was framed by Hardemon:  did the BPD tribunal commit legal error on excluding the letter of recantation?  Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 30A, &#167; 11(2) (West 1992) provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) Unless otherwise provided by any law, agencies need not observe the rules of evidence observed by courts, but shall observe the rules of privilege recognized by law.  Evidence may be admitted and given probative effect only if it is the kind of evidence on which reasonable persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs.   Agencies may exclude unduly repetitious evidence, whether offered on direct examination or cross-examination of witnesses.  (Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The core finding of the BPD tribunal was:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p>12.  Based on the findings and recommendations of the investigation, Mr. Hardemon was terminated from the Boston Police Department on October 6, 1988 for becoming involved in a situation involving family and friends regarding the events set forth in Complaint # 4273, for untruthfulness relative to his participation in the investigation of those events, and for conduct unbecoming a police officer in reference to the two aforementioned charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with Hardemon that the Chief Hearing Officer excluded the exculpatory letter at the hearing on the grounds of relevance.  The BPD tribunal later gave the following reasons in writing for excluding the letter:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Ms. Cansler's letter was not admitted into evidence because its authenticity could not be established.  Furthermore, there is no proof that the addressee, the Legal Department of the Boston Police ever received it.  In fact, when Captain Dunford was presented with the letter on the witness stand, he stated that he had never seen it before.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not agree with Hardemon that the letter was relevant.  The letter had no bearing on the findings by Sergeant Devlin that Hardemon had lied to Devlin during the investigation of Hardemon's conduct on the day of the incident.  Nor did the letter state that Hardemon was not present during the altercation at Jamaica Plain.  As the City correctly points out, \"[t]he issue at the hearing was whether Hardemon was properly terminated based on the findings from that investigation, not from the allegations by Agnes Cansler.\"   City's Br. at 17 (emphasis added).  The letter was tangential at best to the determination that the tribunal was making.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But even if the letter was somehow relevant, it was worthless as evidence.  A comparison between the complaint process and the letter makes this clear.  After she filed the complaint, Ms. Cansler was questioned by the investigating police officer about its contents.  The subsequent recantation letter did not give the investigators any opportunity to probe her new allegations.  They could not ask her in particular why she had originally made a police complaint that she now claims was wholly false, or why her current version of events is any more likely to be true.  The letter was simply unreliable;  it was not \"the kind of evidence on which reasonable persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs.\"  Mass Gen.

Defendant-appellee is the City of Boston.  In order to understand the present posture of the case, it is necessary to follow its procedural path.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October of 1988 Hardemon was a recruit police officer at the Boston Police Academy.  He was discharged from the academy because of unsatisfactory character and failure to adhere to the standard of performance required of Boston Police officers.  Hardemon sued the City in January of 1989 in the Massachusetts Superior Court alleging breach of contract, racial discrimination, libel, reckless infliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy and due process violations by the BPD. The case was removed to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts in February, 1989.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only claim left extant for trial was a denial of substantive due process because of the failure of the BPD to advise Hardemon of his post-termination right to appeal.  All the other claims were waived or found by the district court to be not triable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1992, a jury found that Hardemon had not been informed of his right to a post-termination appeal hearing.  The district court then issued an order which in pertinent part states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.  That, within sixty days of the date of this order, the City of Boston shall petition the Massachusetts Criminal Justice Training Council to hold a hearing to consider:  (a) whether Joseph Hardemon was properly dismissed;  and (b) if so, whether he ought to be reinstated at the first available opportunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to the court's order a BPD disciplinary hearing was held in February 1996 before a tribunal.  The tribunal decided that the dismissal was justified and supported by a preponderance of the evidence.  Hardemon sought judicial review pursuant to Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 249, &#167; 4 (West, 1988), which is entitled \"Action in the nature of certiorari.\"   The parties agreed to have the matter tried before a magistrate judge.  She found that there was no legal error in the tribunal's decision;  an opinion issued on July 23, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to her decision on the merits, the magistrate judge denied the City's motion to dismiss for lack of federal jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two issues before us:  jurisdiction, and whether the BPD tribunal erred as a matter of law in not accepting as an exhibit a letter of recantation by the woman who brought the initial complaint against Hardemon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Jurisdiction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Initially we were tempted to bypass the jurisdictional issue because the City easily prevails on the merits.

The Supreme Court, however, has recently issued a decision in which a plurality disapproves such an approach.  See Steel Co. v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></a></span> (1998).  The various opinions in the case, read as a whole, are not entirely clear as to whether (or to what extent) Steel Co. undermines our earlier practice.  In all events, having noted the red flag, we see no need in this case to test the outer limits of the Court's tolerance, and, thus, we turn to the jurisdictional issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset we note that diversity of citizenship is not questioned.  Hardemon was a resident of Baltimore, Maryland, at the time the complaint was filed.  The focus of the City's attack on jurisdiction is the \"amount in controversy.\"   The City argues that Hardemon's affidavit filed in response to the City's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction failed, as a matter of law, to establish the requisite $50,000 amount in controversy.  The City argues that the district court erred in its reliance on Department of Recreation and Sports of Puerto Rico v. World Boxing Ass'n, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566803\"><a href=\"/opinion/566803/department-of-recreation-and-sports-of-puerto-rico-v-world-boxing/\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1991), for its finding that Hardemon's affidavit sufficed to meet the \"amount in controversy\" requirement.  (The present requirement is $75,000;  at the time the complaint was filed the amount was $50,000.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject this argument.  There is no doubt that the amended complaint met the \"amount in controversy\" requirement.  The pertinent paragraphs of the affidavit state:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>6.  As a result of the wrongful termination, I have lost wages and fringe benefits, including but not limited to vacation pay, medical insurance coverage, tuition benefits and separation benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>7.

It is my belief that if I had been graduated from the Academy and had become a full fledged police officer, that my salary would have been increased substantially but that in any event, I would have been earning no less than the $1,980 which I earned monthly while at the Academy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>9. Based on the itemized losses described above, the total value of the financial loss incurred as a result of the termination, exceeds $50,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">World Boxing Ass'n, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566803\"><a href=\"/opinion/566803/department-of-recreation-and-sports-of-puerto-rico-v-world-boxing/\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span>, was an action for declaratory judgment.  We pointed out that in such an action the amount in controversy is measured by the value of the object of the litigation.  We held that, \"[t]he amounts actually mentioned in the record for airfares and hotel bills and for the services of a handwriting expert--have nothing to do with the value of the right the Commission is seeking to vindicate in this lawsuit.\"  Id. at 88.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The instant case is not a declaratory judgment action.  It is an action alleging wrongful termination.  Secondly, the magistrate judge did not cite to World Boxing Ass'n for the proposition that, \"Hardemon's affidavit alleging losses in backpay satisfied his burden of demonstrating the requisite jurisdictional amount.\"   City's Br. at 12.  We quote from the opinion below:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a general matter, plaintiff's burden of proving it meets the required amount in controversy is satisfied by simply alleging the amount in the complaint.

However, there is long standing precedent that once diversity jurisdiction has been challenged, the burden shifts from merely averring the amount in controversy to substantiating the amount in controversy.  See Gibbs v. Buck, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103195\"><a href=\"/opinion/103195/gibbs-v-buck/\"><span class=\"volume\">307</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></a></span>, 72, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103195\"><a href=\"/opinion/103195/gibbs-v-buck/\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

When faced with a motion to dismiss, plaintiff has the burden of proving jurisdiction \"by showing that it does not appear to legal certainty that its claim is for less than the jurisdictional amount.\"  Frederick, 713 F.Supp. at 47.   Plaintiff may meet this burden by amending the pleading or by submitting affidavits which sufficiently substantiate the alleged amount in controversy.  Kenney v. Hoover, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">909</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

It was not the court below that erred in relying on World Boxing Ass'n but counsel for the City who misread the district court's opinion.  This error is compounded by the City's conversion of a statement in a declaratory judgment case about the value of the right sought into a general diversity rule that what matters is the value of the right sought, not the amount of damages claimed.  Based on this infirm premise the City argues that, \"Hardemon's allegation of loss of back pay had nothing to do with the right he was seeking to vindicate in his complaint to the district court, to wit, the right to clear his name.\"   City's Br. at 13.  But there is nothing in the complaint asserting Hardemon's right to clear his name.  Counts one through fourteen were factual assertions and background information.

Due process affords protection against damage to a person's standing and associations in the community, and against actions by an employer which foreclose employment opportunities because these are liberty interests within the reach of the Fourteenth Amendment....  When these liberty interests have been violated, a nonpermanent municipal employee is entitled to a termination hearing for the sole purpose of clearing his name and thereby restoring his reputation.  A violation occurs if an employer \"creates and disseminates a false and defamatory impression about the employee in connection with his termination....\"  Codd v.

However, because of the limited purpose of the hearing to clear one's name, it is a condition precedent to the hearing that the employee deny the charges.  \"If he does not challenge the substantial truth of the material in question, no hearing would afford a promise of achieving that result for him.\"  Codd, 429 U.S. at 627-28, 97 S.Ct. at 884....

It was \"[w]hen these liberty interests have been violated,\" id., that \"a nonpermanent employee is entitled to a termination hearing for the sole purpose of clearing his name and thereby restoring his reputation,\" id.   Hardemon, however, alleged a procedural due process violation on the basis of the City's failure to inform him of his right to appeal the termination decision.  He was not seeking to clear his name on the basis of the liberty interests recognized in Grant.  Grant is of no avail to the City.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is an additional reason why Hardemon's affidavit relying on back pay to meet the amount in controversy requirement was sufficient.  After the jury verdict finding a substantive due process violation, the district court ordered the City to hold a hearing to consider whether Hardemon was properly dismissed \"and (b) if so, whether he ought to be reinstated at the first available opportunity.\"   Obviously, if Hardemon were reinstated he would be entitled to back pay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the holding of the district court that Hardemon's affidavit sufficed to meet \"the amount in controversy\" jurisdictional requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the district court, the City argued that a state statute vesting jurisdiction in the Massachusetts Superior Court of this type of action precluded federal jurisdiction.

Unlike the district court we are not called upon to determine whether the BPD tribunal's decision should be affirmed.  The magistrate judge affirmed the tribunal's refusal to reinstate Hardemon to the Boston Police Department, ruling that, \"there was no legal error in the Tribunal's decision.\"   Our focus is narrowed to the sole question of whether it was legal error for the BPD tribunal to refuse to admit the letter of recantation into evidence.  Hardemon's appeal is based solely on this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing the tribunal opinion, the magistrate judge stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>Ms. Cansler's letter was not admitted because its authentication was not established.4 Further, there was no evidence that the letter was ever received by the legal department of the Boston Police and thus could not be considered during the investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The footnote states:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>4 Plaintiff contends that Ms. Cansler's whereabouts could not be determined at the time of the hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These rulings and findings, if so they be, are not given any deference by us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevant facts are as follows.  Close to midnight on July 11, 1988, Recruit Officer Hardemon went to a house in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, to support his friend Timothy Ellerbee in a dispute with in-laws.  The dispute degenerated into name-calling and rock throwing.  Agnes Cansler armed herself with a baseball bat to defend herself from the Ellerbees.  Hardemon took the baseball bat away from her.  On July 13, Agnes Cansler filed a complaint with the police department, which stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About 7 p.m. there was a family dispute involving inlaws [sic] at the home of the complainant, which was responded to by Area E officers.  As a result of that fight, Recruit Officer Joe Hardemon, best friend of one of the inlaws involved earlier, Tim Ellerbe, of 2031 Columbus Ave., came to Ms. Cansler's home with approximately 9 other B/Ms.  These young men came to continue the fight started earlier.  After James Ellerbe (Tim's brother) pushed and hit Ms. Cansler's mother, Thelma Harris, 61 years, Ms. Cansler picked up and was swinging a bat in self-protection, but she did not hit anyone with it.  Some members of the group with Recruit Officer Hardemon were throwing bottles.  Recruit Hardemon was encouraging the group to attack Ms. Cansler by shouting, \"Why don't you Bumrush her!!!\"    A neighbor called the police and several officers from Area E responded.  A black officer spoke with Recruit Hardemon and told him that he would see him at the Academy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ms. Cansler feels that Recruit Hardemon should not have joined into this family problem and should definately [sic] not have taken an active part in the fight, but, as a police officer, should have tried to calm or prevent the incident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p>(Note:  as a result of this fight, Ms. Cansler's daughter, Lasanya, 16 years, sustained a minor injury to her face.  This was inflicted by James Ellerbe.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The letter of recantation states:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p>To the Legal Department of Boston Police,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I, Agnes Cansler made a complaint about Joe Hardemon on Boylston St. Jamaica Plain on July 12, 1988.

He found that Hardemon lied about two matters concerning Hardemon's conduct prior to the incident itself.  The BPD tribunal found that there was ample evidence that Hardemon had made untruthful statements to Sergeant Devlin during the investigation.  The tribunal also concluded that Hardemon was improperly involved in an altercation involving family and friends.  Agnes Cansler is the sister of Cheryl Harris who had a relationship with Hardemon and was the mother of his twin daughters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our scope of review is restricted by the issue which was framed by Hardemon:  did the BPD tribunal commit legal error on excluding the letter of recantation?  Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 30A, &#167; 11(2) (West 1992) provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) Unless otherwise provided by any law, agencies need not observe the rules of evidence observed by courts, but shall observe the rules of privilege recognized by law.  Evidence may be admitted and given probative effect only if it is the kind of evidence on which reasonable persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs.   Agencies may exclude unduly repetitious evidence, whether offered on direct examination or cross-examination of witnesses.  (Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The core finding of the BPD tribunal was:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p>12.  Based on the findings and recommendations of the investigation, Mr. Hardemon was terminated from the Boston Police Department on October 6, 1988 for becoming involved in a situation involving family and friends regarding the events set forth in Complaint # 4273, for untruthfulness relative to his participation in the investigation of those events, and for conduct unbecoming a police officer in reference to the two aforementioned charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with Hardemon that the Chief Hearing Officer excluded the exculpatory letter at the hearing on the grounds of relevance.  The BPD tribunal later gave the following reasons in writing for excluding the letter:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Ms. Cansler's letter was not admitted into evidence because its authenticity could not be established.  Furthermore, there is no proof that the addressee, the Legal Department of the Boston Police ever received it.  In fact, when Captain Dunford was presented with the letter on the witness stand, he stated that he had never seen it before.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not agree with Hardemon that the letter was relevant.  The letter had no bearing on the findings by Sergeant Devlin that Hardemon had lied to Devlin during the investigation of Hardemon's conduct on the day of the incident.  Nor did the letter state that Hardemon was not present during the altercation at Jamaica Plain.  As the City correctly points out, \"[t]he issue at the hearing was whether Hardemon was properly terminated based on the findings from that investigation, not from the allegations by Agnes Cansler.\"   City's Br. at 17 (emphasis added).  The letter was tangential at best to the determination that the tribunal was making.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But even if the letter was somehow relevant, it was worthless as evidence.  A comparison between the complaint process and the letter makes this clear.  After she filed the complaint, Ms. Cansler was questioned by the investigating police officer about its contents.  The subsequent recantation letter did not give the investigators any opportunity to probe her new allegations.  They could not ask her in particular why she had originally made a police complaint that she now claims was wholly false, or why her current version of events is any more likely to be true.  The letter was simply unreliable;  it was not \"the kind of evidence on which reasonable persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs.\"  Mass Gen.
