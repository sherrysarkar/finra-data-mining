LeBlanc appeals\n\nfrom a district court decision upholding the determination\n\nby an administrative law judge (\"ALJ\") that LeBlanc was\n\nentitled    only      to    a    closed     period        of   Social     Security\n\ndisability benefits due to a back condition.                          We affirm,\n\nessentially for the reasons given by District Judge George\n\nO'Toole    in   his    well-written         Memorandum         and   Order   dated\n\nFebruary 5, 2001.          We add only the following comments.\n\n            First,     in       arguing    that     the    ALJ    erred    in    her\n\ndecision, LeBlanc relies in part on medical evidence he\n\nsubmitted to the Appeals Council, but not to the ALJ.                           As a\n\nrecent decision by this court indicates, in reviewing an ALJ\n\ndecision, we do not consider such new evidence that was\n\nnever presented to the ALJ.               See Mills v. Apfel, 244 F.3d 1,\n\n4 (1st Cir. 2001), pet. for cert. filed (Aug. 29, 2001) (No.\n\n0l-6108)    (stating        that    the     court    would       review    an    ALJ\n\ndecision \"solely on the evidence presented to the ALJ\").\n\nSecond, we have considered the Appeals Council's denial of\n\nreview in light of that evidence.                    See id. (indicating a\n\ndenial of review by the Appeals Council may be reviewable if\n\nit \"gives an egregiously mistaken ground for this action\").\n\nBut we conclude that the Appeals Council reasonably denied\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\freview because of the sporadic nature of any impairment\n\ncaused     by   LeBlanc's   cervical   herniation,   which   was\n\neventually addressed by surgery.       See Chester v. Callahan,\n\n193 F.3d 10, 12 (1st Cir. 1999) (affirming district court\n\njudgment upholding denial of benefits where the \"disabling\n\nnature\" of the claimant's condition had not lasted for 12\n\nmonths).\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -3-\n\f",
