He\r\n\nwas deported in  November 1993.   He subsequently obtained  a\r\n\nvisa and reentered in August 1994 without having obtained the\r\n\nnecessary permission of the  Attorney General, a violation of\r\n\n8  U.S.C.   1326.1  After  a three day  jury trial, defendant\r\n\nwas found guilty.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n          Prior to trial, defendant moved to quash or dismiss\r\n\nthe  indictment by  attacking  the earlier  deportation order\r\n\nentered after a hearing in his absence, on the ground of lack\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Title 8  U.S.C.   1326  provides that an  offense against\r\nthe United States occurs when:\r\n\n          (a) [A]ny alien who--\r\n\n               (1)   has  been   arrested  and\r\n               deported   or    excluded   and\r\n               deported, and thereafter \r\n\n               (2) enters,  attempts to enter,\r\n               or is at any time found in, the\r\n               United States, unless (A) prior\r\n               to his reembarkation at a place\r\n               outside  the  United States  or\r\n               his  application for  admission\r\n               from     foreign     contiguous\r\n               territory, the Attorney General\r\n               has expressly consented to such\r\n               alien's      reapplying     for\r\n               admission; or  (B) with respect\r\n               to an alien previously excluded\r\n               and deported, unless such alien\r\n               shall establish that he was not\r\n               required to obtain such advance\r\n               consent  under this  chapter or\r\n               any prior Act . . . .\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nof  notice.  According to the defendant, he failed to receive\r\n\neither   of  two   letters  sent   by  the   Immigration  and\r\n\nNaturalization  Service  ordering  him  to  appear  first  on\r\n\nDecember  1, 1992 and  again on January  5, 1993.   The court\r\n\ndenied  the motion,  finding that  certified mail  notice had\r\n\nbeen  given to  defendant's  proper address  with the  return\r\n\nreceipt bearing his signature, which the court found genuine.\r\n\nNor would  he have had any  defense on the merits.   We agree\r\n\nthat the deportation order was valid.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n          Defendant's  only  other  defense  to  the  present\r\n\nprosecution was  his testimony that he entered in good faith,\r\n\nbelieving that  his visa constituted the required permission.\r\n\nThe court instructed the jury that it  was not, and that good\r\n\nfaith was not a defense.  \r\n\n          The district  court noted that of  all the circuits\r\n\nconsidering this statute, only  the Seventh Circuit in United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates  v. Anton, 683 F.2d  1011, 1014 (7th  Cir. 1982) (2-1)\r                            \r\n\nrequired the government to show specific intent.  We are more\r\n\nimpressed  with dissenting  Judge Posner's  thinking  that an\r\n\nalien who  has broken our laws  once should not  be given the\r\n\nbenefit of the doubt.  See id. at 1019-22 (collecting cases).\r                                          \r\n\nIt  is  appropriate that  the reentry  law  have teeth.   The\r\n\nappeal is without merit.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
