The National Labor\r                                                   \r\n\nRelations Board (\"the Board\") asks us to enforce its decision\r\n\nand order of  October 31, 1996, finding that  McGaw of Puerto\r\n\nRico,  Inc. (\"McGaw\"  or \"the  Company\")  engaged in  various\r\n\nunfair labor practices  in violation of Sections  8(a)(1) and\r\n\n(3) of the  National Labor Relations Act (\"the  Act\").  McGaw\r\n\nresponds  that  substantial  evidence does  not  support  the\r\n\nBoard's  findings that  it  unlawfully discriminated  against\r\n\nemployees  because  of their  engagement in  union activities\r\n\nand/or  to  discourage  others  from  such  engagement.    We\r\n\ndisagree, and grant the request for enforcement.\r\n\n                    I.  Factual Background\r\n\n          The record  supports the  Board's findings1 of  the\r\n\nfollowing  facts,   arranged  chronologically.     McGaw  has\r\n\nmanufactured  medical devices and related products at a plant\r\n\nin Sabana Grande,  Puerto Rico, since 1974.   With about 1100\r\n\nemployees working three shifts at  the plant, McGaw is one of\r\n\nthe largest employers in the region.  The Congreso de Uniones\r\n\nIndustriales  de Puerto Rico (\"the Union\") has been trying to\r\n\norganize McGaw's Sabana  Grande workers since 1992.   Several\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The  Board  completely  adopted  the  findings  of  fact,\r\nconclusions   of   law,   and   recommended   order   of  the\r\nadministrative law judge  (\"the ALJ\") who  heard the case  in\r\nJune 1995.   The Board need not make  independent findings or\r\nconduct  a separate  analysis of  the  factors prompting  the\r\norder if it specifically adopts the findings and reasoning of\r\nthe ALJ.   See, e.g., NLRB v.  Horizon Air Servs.,  Inc., 761\r                                                                    \r\nF.2d 22, 24 n.1 (1st Cir. 1985).\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nMcGaw  employees,  including alleged  discriminatees  Charlie\r\n\nSilva, Vigdalia Rodriguez,  and Lourdes Irizarry --  all Line\r\n\nProduction  Clerks (\"LPCs\")  at the  Company  -- were  active\r\n\nleaders in the Union's efforts.   Individually or as a group,\r\n\nthey  distributed  union authorization  cards  at the  plant,\r\n\nspoke  to  employees  about  the  Union,  acted  as  election\r\n\nobservers, delivered  speeches over loudspeakers in  front of\r\n\nthe plant, promoted the Union  on a local radio program, wore\r\n\nprounion stickers, and held union meetings at their homes.\r\n\n          The Company reorganized  its engineering department\r\n\nin 1992,  eliminating, first, several  mechanic positions and\r\n\nlater, four  LPC positions.  The affected  employees were not\r\n\nlaid off, but,  instead, reassigned to other  positions.  The\r\n\nCompany  advised them by memo that  \"the elimination of these\r\n\npositions was  carried out taking into  consideration several\r\n\nfactors  such  as general  skills  and  abilities, seniority,\r\n\nattitude and others concerning general performance.\"\r\n\n          The Union, by a narrow margin, won an election held\r\n\nin  February 1993.   After  48  ballots were  challenged, the\r\n\nparties stipulated to  a second election, to  be conducted on\r\n\nNovember  9  by  the  Board.   In  the  meantime,  McGaw  was\r\n\nundergoing  significant  operational   reorganization.    Ira\r\n\nMarshall (\"Marshall\"),  appointed General  Manager at  Sabana\r\n\nGrande   in  July  1993,  found  the  existing  operations  a\r\n\n\"disorganized  mess\" and  set  about a  multi-million  dollar\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\noverhaul  of the plant's  production system.   Central to the\r\n\nreorganization  of  the Company's  operations was  the phased\r\n\nreplacement  of  its  \"workcell\"  production  method  with  a\r\n\nconveyor  belt system.    Under  the  workcell  system,  each\r\n\nemployee  completely assembled a given product.  LPCs liaised\r\n\nbetween supervisors and  production employees, keeping  track\r\n\nof  production by performing  largely clerical tasks.   Under\r\n\nthe new conveyor  system, each employee performed  a discrete\r\n\npartial assembly step.   LPCs often worked the  conveyor belt\r\n\nalongside   production  employees   during  the   transition,\r\n\nalthough  installation of the belts rendered obsolete much of\r\n\ntheir clerical responsibilities.\r\n\n          In  October 1993,  the Company  laid  off some  140\r\n\nemployees  as part  of  its  restructuring.    Preceding  the\r\n\nlayoff,  Human  Resources  Manager Alex  Solla  informed  the\r\n\nemployees  by  memo that  \"[s]eniority  (employment  date) by\r\n\nclassification and general performance are the  criteria used\r\n\nin order to  determine affected employees,\" and  that \"hourly\r\n\nemployees   affected  and   having  more  seniority   in  the\r\n\norganization   will    be   offered   the    opportunity   of\r\n\nbumping/replace [sic] other employees  with less seniority in\r\n\nAssembler  I positions.\"    In the  same  month, the  Company\r\n\nclosed its sterilization department and transferred about ten\r\n\naffected employees to production.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n          In the  following month, McGaw installed  its first\r\n\nconveyor   belt.    Also,  the  Board  conducted  its  second\r\n\nelection, in which  the Union failed to get  a majority vote.\r\n\nWeeks before the election, a Company supervisor had asked LPC\r\n\nMaria Belen whether she had been \"promoting the Union amongst\r\n\nthe employees.\"  Company officials also asked her why she had\r\n\nnot identified herself as a  non-union employee by wearing  a\r\n\n\"NO\"  sticker, to  which  she  replied  that  she  considered\r\n\nherself a key person among  employees and that wearing such a\r\n\nsticker might create friction within the Company.\r\n\n          Restructuring  continued  in   February  1994,  the\r\n\nCompany  laying off  close  to  twenty  employees.   Also  in\r\n\nFebruary, the Company changed its LPC shift assignment policy\r\n\nfrom classification  seniority to  plantwide seniority.   The\r\n\nCompany notified  affected employees  of its  \"new change  of\r\n\npolicy\" by letter: \"[p]ursuant to the seniority policy of our\r\n\ncompany, we have  restructured the assignment of  work shifts\r\n\nof the line production  clerk position, in accordance  to the\r\n\ndate  when the incumbents  in such position  began working at\r\n\n[the Company]  (plant seniority).\"   LPCs  Nilsa Nazario  and\r\n\nVigdalia  Rodriguez, forced  to take  less desirable  shifts,\r\n\ncomplained to management  about the change and  lack of prior\r\n\nnotice.    At  a  February  28  meeting  with  a  supervisor,\r\n\nRodriguez  asked about  the change,  and  received the  vague\r\n\nexplanation that \"Company policy had changed a while back.\"\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\n          Sometime in  February or March, a  supervisor asked\r\n\nLPC  Raquel Gonzalez,  a member  of the  \"Vote No\"  group, to\r\n\nreport to management any future union activity of LPC Lourdes\r\n\nIrizarry known to Gonzalez.  Gonzalez promised to comply, but\r\n\nnever in fact reported anything about Irizarry.\r\n\n          In  a  conversation  on or  about  March  10, Human\r\n\nResources Manager  Solla  told LPC  Silva that  he and  other\r\n\nemployees  \"were  mistaken  with the  union  idea  because if\r\n\nSabana Grande  had been  a large town,  the Union  would have\r\n\nwon.  But since Sabana Grande was a small town, it was a town\r\n\nwith people with  small minds.  And that it would be easy for\r\n\nthe Company to scare people and get them to vote against  the\r\n\nUnion.\"\r\n\n          Sometime   in   April,   Production  Superintendent\r\n\nGeraldo Gonzalez asked LPC Belen \"what kind of comments [she]\r\n\nhad overheard  about the Union.\"   He later told her  that if\r\n\nthe  Union \"came  back,\" McGaw's  owners would not  fight the\r\n\nUnion, but rather would  close the plant without  warning and\r\n\nwithout   paying  workers  for  their  final  week  of  work.\r\n\nGonzalez further  added that \"the  people that were  laid off\r\n\nfor  that reason  would not  be able  to get work  from other\r\n\ncompanies because  they would  know that  the reason  for the\r\n\nlayoff was because of unions.\"\r\n\n          It  became  clear  to  Company management  sometime\r\n\nduring  the first half  of 1994 that  personnel changes would\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\naccompany the  production transition.   In a  May 18  memo to\r\n\nSolla, Marshall indicated his views  as to the need for \"less\r\n\nunskilled  people\" under  the conveyor  system,  the need  to\r\n\nestablish a \"new  more technical and flat  organization,\" and\r\n\nthe need  to replace  \"many people that  cannot adapt  to the\r\n\ntechnology.\"   He instructed  Solla to  meet with  Operations\r\n\nManager Juan  Luis  Santa to  \"develop  a tentative  plan  to\r\n\norganize and upgrade our human technical expertise . . . [and\r\n\nthat] this should be done by 610/94 [sic].\"\r\n\n          Around  the same time,  the Union campaigned  for a\r\n\nthird  election.  Union  president Jose Figueroa,  along with\r\n\nLPCs  Silva and Irizarry  and mechanic Juan  Vargas, arranged\r\n\nfor  a May 29 meeting of prounion  employees, held at a local\r\n\nbeach.  A  McGaw supervisor stood within visual  range of the\r\n\nmeeting,  and an employee who was in the \"Vote No\" group also\r\n\nwas seen nearby.\r\n\n          Management memos and documents dated shortly  after\r\n\nthe  May 29 Union meeting confirm the Company's determination\r\n\nto  eliminate  LPC positions.    In  a  June  8 memo  to  his\r\n\nsupervisor, Gary Sielski, Marshall indicated the  anticipated\r\n\nelimination  of   10  LPC  positions,  stating   that  \"[t]he\r\n\nobjective  will  be  to   discharge  people  by  performance,\r\n\neducational training, and seniority.  We are doing this . . .\r\n\n[because] [w]e need  people with the discipline to manage the\r\n\n[conveyor] system.    They must  also have  the education  to\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nlearn  to use the system and perform additional reporting and\r\n\nrecord keeping.\"   In a  memo to Marshall the  following day,\r\n\nOperations Manager Santa  stated that he had  requested Human\r\n\nResources Manager Solla  to \"reduce ten (10)  production line\r\n\nclerks,  based  on  performance,  academic  background,   and\r\n\nseniority,\"  with the direction  that the reduction  occur no\r\n\nlater than the end of June.  On June 13, Marshall submitted a\r\n\n\"Monthly  Activity  Report\"  to Sielski,  setting  forth  the\r\n\nCompany's activities, plans, and  priorities, and identifying\r\n\nthe elimination of the \"union threat\" as one of the Company's\r\n\npriorities.   The Report also  stated the Company's  plans to\r\n\n\"hire  39  people, 29  for  increased production  and  10 for\r\n\nbacklogged rework.\"\r\n\n          On or  about June 22, Company  officials, including\r\n\nMarshall,  Solla,  and  Employee   Relations  Manager  Miriam\r\n\nFigueroa,  met with employees.   According to  LPC Rodriguez,\r\n\nMarshall stated  that \"he did not want third parties involved\r\n\nin the plant  with them  because [the  employees] could  talk\r\n\nwith them,  or dialogue  with them.\"   She further  testified\r\n\nthat  Marshall stated  that \"neither  the  employees nor  the\r\n\nsupervisors  needed to  talk about the  Union, that  the only\r\n\npeople that  could talk  about Unions  were himself  and Alex\r\n\nSolla.\"   LPC Silva testified  that Marshall stated  that the\r\n\nCompany had a lot of money to invest in employee salaries and\r\n\nbenefits, and that  he \"didn't want third parties  to come in\r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\norder to  obtain those  benefits for the  employees.\"   Silva\r\n\nrecalled  that  Marshall  said  he  \"did  not  want  to  hear\r\n\nemployees talking in the hallways,  whether it be pro or con,\r\n\nfor or against the Union, and that if there needed to  be any\r\n\nUnion talk in McGaw it would be done between himself and Alex\r\n\nSolla in  his office.\"   Silva  also testified that  Marshall\r\n\ntold  the employees that  \"things were  looking good\"  at the\r\n\ncompany, that  sales were up,  and that \"at the  moment there\r\n\nwere no plans to fire or dismiss anybody.\"\r\n\n          Marshall claimed  that, because emotions  about the\r\n\nUnion were running high, he  stressed to the employees at the\r\n\nmeeting that \"no  one was to be threatening  anyone . . . for\r\n\nsupporting or not supporting the  Union.\"  He claimed that it\r\n\nwas Solla rather than he who told the  employees that only he\r\n\nand Solla were authorized to  discuss the Union, and that the\r\n\nstatement  referred  to those  management officials  who were\r\n\nauthorized to  speak on behalf  of the Company  regarding the\r\n\nUnion.    Figueroa  testified  that  Marshall  informed   the\r\n\nemployees  that  he   would  not  allow  any   threats  among\r\n\nemployees, and that  anyone who felt threatened  should speak\r\n\nwith Solla or him.  Figueroa's testimony was consistent  with\r\n\nMarshall's insofar as it was Solla who had said that the only\r\n\nmanagement representatives allowed  to \"make  any updates  on\r\n\nthe Union\" were Marshall and Solla.\r\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\n          Barely  more than  a week  later,  on June  30, the\r\n\nCompany  laid off nine LPCs.  The  nine were laid off without\r\n\nwarning, and strictly according to plantwide seniority rather\r\n\nthan the manifold  criteria listed in the  Marshall and Santa\r\n\nmemos.   Marshall testified that  Santa, rather than  he, was\r\n\nresponsible for the  change, and claimed that Santa and Solla\r\n\nhad met with the Company's legal counsel, who advised them to\r\n\n\"just  stick with  Law 80\"2  and go  by \"length  of service.\"\r\n\nCompany  officials  conducted  layoff   interviews  with  the\r\n\naffected employees, who  were told that the layoffs  were due\r\n\nto restructuring.   Several asked about being  transferred to\r\n\nother positions,  as had  been the  Company's past  practice.\r\n\nThey  were told, variously, that \"Company policy had changed,\r\n\nand that they would no longer be doing it that way,\" \"Company\r\n\npolicy  is that if a  job classification is eliminated, there\r\n\nis no chance of relocation,\" \"Company policy was no longer to\r\n\nrelocate people in lower  positions, and that the policy  had\r\n\nchanged,\" and \"we  don't have any openings at  that time, and\r\n\nif we do that, we would be violating Law 80.\"   Following the\r\n\nJune  layoff,   the  Company   hired  about  50   \"temporary\"\r\n\nproduction employees, and would have refused to rehire any of\r\n\nthe laid-off employees as temporary employees had they asked.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  \"Law  80\"  is Puerto  Rico  Public  Law  80, 29  L.P.R.A.\r\n  185a-m.   Law  80 addresses  an  employer's obligations  in\r\nreducing its workforce.  The Company's claims with respect to\r\nLaw 80 are addressed below.\r\n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\n          The Company installed two additional conveyor belts\r\n\nin July 1994, and two more in April 1995.\r\n\n                  II.  Procedural Background\r\n\n          Pursuant to charges  filed by the Union,  the Board\r\n\nissued a complaint  and notice of hearing on  March 24, 1995.\r\n\nThe complaint alleged that McGaw violated Section 8(a)(1)3 of\r\n\nthe  National  Labor  Relations Act  (\"the  Act\"),  29 U.S.C.\r\n\n  158(a)(1), by  soliciting employees  to spy  on and  report\r\n\nother employees'  union activities,  expressing to  employees\r\n\nthe  futility of engaging in union activities by telling them\r\n\nit was easy to instill fear  in them so that they would  vote\r\n\nagainst the Union,  interrogating an employee  concerning the\r\n\nUnion's  activities  at   the  Company's  plant,  threatening\r\n\nemployees with  plant  closure  and  loss of  wages  if  they\r\n\nsupported  the  Union, threatening  to  \"blackball\" employees\r\n\nregarding future  employment opportunities if  they supported\r\n\nthe Union, and  prohibiting employees from talking  about the\r\n\nUnion at the plant.

Whether  an  employer's  action  adverse  to\r\n\nemployees  is a   8(a)(3)  violation turns on  the employer's\r\n\nprimary  motivation.   See generally  NLRB v.

McGaw demands  more  than is\r\n\nrequired.   Some of  those laid off  -- Irizarry,  Silva, and\r\n\nRodriguez  --  clearly  were among  the  Union's  most ardent\r\n\nsupporters,  and  the  Company  need not  lay  off  all union\r\n\nsupporters  at once  to  violate    8(a)(3).

This  strains  credibility.    LPCs\r\n\nRodriguez, Irizarry,  and Silva  each were  overt and  active\r\n\nUnion supporters, both within and without the plant.   Before\r\n\nthe ALJ, Company officials admitted to knowing as much and to\r\n\nobserving union activity at the plant.  Further, McGaw failed\r\n\nto  explain  credited  allegations  that  Company   officials\r\n\nsolicited an employee to  spy and report on  Irizarry's union\r\n\nactivities  and,  barely  a month  before  the  June layoffs,\r\n\nobserved  the Union  meeting  at the  beach  where Silva  and\r\n\nIrizarry  were present.   Also, McGaw's denial  of anti-union\r\n\nanimus  falls  flat  in light  of  Marshall's  comments about\r\n\ndissolving the \"union threat\" and keeping \"third parties\" out\r\n\nof the plant,  the Company's attempts to spy  on Irizarry and\r\n\nto  intimidate  union  supporters through  interrogation  and\r\n\nvarious  threats, the Company's interrogation of LPC Belen as\r\n\nto her Union sentiments, as well as the Company's prohibition\r\n\nof  discussion of  the Union  among  employees.   Substantial\r\n\nevidence  supports the Board's findings of both knowledge and\r\n\nanti-union animus.\r\n\n          Closing its assault on  the General Counsel's prima\r\n\nfacie case, McGaw argues that, because both Union and Company\r\n\nsupporters were  laid  off, a  sufficient  causal  connection\r\n\nbetween any anti-union animus and  its actions is absent.  As\r\n\n                             -18-\r\r\n\nnoted,  adverse  action   may  be  unlawfully  discriminatory\r\n\nwhether or not all union adherents suffer at once.

In any case, McGaw misses  the mark;\r                \r\n\nit  is  the   departure  from  past  Company   practices,  in\r\n\ncombination with the LPC layoffs,  that the Board found to be\r\n\na  violation.    It  is  undisputed  that,   had  McGaw  used\r\n\nclassification seniority to effectuate the June layoffs, LPCs\r\n\nIrizarry, Rodriguez, and Belen would not  have been laid off.\r\n\nAlso, McGaw inexplicably  departed from its past  practice of\r\n\nrelocating, rather than  laying off, workers when  a position\r\n\nwas phased out.   This occurred at  a time when its  managers\r\n\nexpressed  the need  for \"less  unskilled  people\" under  the\r\n\nconveyor system and more people with the \"education  to learn\r\n\nto use the system and perform additional reporting and record\r\n\nkeeping,\" and  at a  time when  it planned  to hire  about 40\r\n\npeople for production and rework  (and in fact hired about 50\r\n\n\"temporary\"  production  employees   following  the  layoff).\r\n\nThese  facts, together  with McGaw's knowledge  of Irizarry's\r\n\nand Rodriguez's  union activities,  its suspicion of  Belen's\r\n\nunion sentiments,  and its anti-union animosity,  support the\r\n\nBoard's inference that McGaw changed its LPC seniority policy\r\n\nin February 1994  if not to discriminate  immediately against\r\n\nunion supporters then  to lay the groundwork for the eventual\r\n\ntermination of  key union  leaders in the  LPC position.   We\r\n\n                             -19-\r\r\n\nreject McGaw's  position that  no causal  connection existed,\r\n\nand instead accept  the Board's conclusion that  such adverse\r\n\naction,  calculated to affect  key Union  leaders, unlawfully\r\n\ndiscriminated  against Union  activists  and/or was  taken to\r\n\ndiscourage others from supporting the Union.\r\n\n          Prepared  for  rejection  of  its  first  round  of\r\n\nargument,  McGaw responds  that  legitimate business  reasons\r\n\nwould have led it to lay off the nine LPCs, regardless of any\r\n\nunion  animosity.    The Board  accepted  that  the Company's\r\n\nproduction transition  inevitably would render  obsolete many\r\n\nof the LPCs'  traditional functions, and we  do not disagree.\r\n\nBut again, McGaw misses the point.  The issue is not  whether\r\n\nMcGaw  had a primary nondiscriminatory reason for the layoffs\r\n\ngenerally, but rather whether it  had such a reason to depart\r\n\nfrom its past practices, departures which appear to have been\r\n\ncalculated to adversely impact employees engaged in protected\r\n\nactivities.

NLRB,  804 F.2d  808, 814  (3d Cir.\r                                          \r\n\n1986) (same), cert.  denied, 481 U.S. 1069  (1987); Merchants\r                                                                         \r\n\nTruck  Line,  577  F.2d  at  1016 (same).    To  this,  McGaw\r                       \r\n\npersistently  but  rather  lamely  maintains  that  it  never\r\n\n                             -20-\r\r\n\nchanged policies at all.   We must  reject this; not only  do\r\n\nthe Company's past practices and statements, recounted above,\r\n\nindicate the opposite, but the ALJ found McGaw's sole witness\r\n\non this issue -- Miriam Figueroa -- not to be credible.   The\r\n\nBoard did  not disturb this  credibility finding; nor  do we.\r\n\nThus, McGaw's explanation for the layoffs, although plausibly\r\n\nnon-discriminatory, does not explain  why the Company changed\r\n\nits seniority and relocation policies.\r\n\n          Finally, McGaw points to Puerto Rico Public Law 80,\r\n\n29  L.P.R.A.   185a-m  (\"Law 80\"),  as  requiring it  to make\r\n\nlayoffs according to plantwide seniority.  Despite the weight\r\n\nof the  evidence, McGaw  maintains  that it  has always  used\r\n\nplantwide   seniority,  in   accordance  with   Law   80,  in\r\n\neffectuating layoffs.  Its  unstated argument, apparently, is\r\n\nthat  even if this is found not true, its switch to plantwide\r\n\nseniority from classification seniority was nondiscriminatory\r\n\nbecause Law 80 required the change.  The Board did not agree;\r\n\nnor do we.\r\n\n          Law  80  entitles   employees  who  are  discharged\r\n\n\"without good cause\" to severance compensation, calculated in\r\n\npart  by years  of service.   See    185a.  \"Good  cause,\" in\r                                             \r\n\nturn, includes the full, temporary, or partial closing of the\r\n\nemployer's    operations,      185b(d),    technological   or\r\n\nreorganization   changes,     185b(e),  and   reductions   in\r\n\nemployment made necessary  by a reduction in  the anticipated\r\n\n                             -21-\r\r\n\nor  prevailing volume of production, sales, or profits at the\r\n\ntime  of the  discharge,   185b(f).   In  any of  these three\r\n\ncircumstances, the employer has a\r\n\n          duty . . .  to retain those  employees of\r\n          greater   seniority  on   the  job   with\r\n          preference, provided there  are positions\r\n          vacant  or filled  by  employees of  less\r\n          seniority   in  the   job  within   their\r\n          occupational classification which  may be\r\n          held by them . . .  except . . . in those\r\n          cases  in  which  there  is  a  clear and\r\n          conclusive  difference  in favor  of  the\r\n          efficiency  or  capacity of  the  workers\r\n          compared,  in  which  case  the  capacity\r\n          shall prevail . . . .\r\n\n  185c.   McGaw  clings  to this  provision  as  a  statutory\r\n\ncommand  to   use  plantwide,  rather   than  classification,\r\n\nseniority.\r\n\n          The meaning of   185c is less than clear.  The word\r\n\n\"job\"   could   refer    to   employment   generally   (i.e.,\r\n\n\"plantwide\"), or to  employment in a specific  position.  The\r\n\nGuidelines  for the Interpretation and Application of Law 80,\r\n\nMay 30, 1976  (\"Guidelines\"), promulgated by the  Puerto Rico\r\n\nDepartment of Labor and Human Resources, indicate the former,\r\n\nalthough they are nevertheless ambiguous as to the meaning of\r\n\n  185c.  On the one hand, the Guidelines say:\r\n\n          If there  is a need  to dismiss employees\r\n          within   any    or   some    occupational\r\n          classifications,  the  employer  will  be\r\n          obligated  to retain  with preference  in\r\n          said classifications  the employees  with\r\n          the  greatest seniority  in the  company,\r                                                              \r\n          and to  that effect  all the  time worked\r\n          continuously and uninterruptedly  for the\r\n          company will be considered, regardless of\r\n\n                             -22-\r\r\n\n          the  occupational  classifications  where\r\n          they were performed.\r\n\nGuidelines, 9  (emphasis  added).   On  the other  hand,  the\r\n\nGuidelines say:  \"When the  employer needs to lay off workers\r\n\n. . .  he does  not necessarily  have to  do so  following an\r\n\norder of seniority since the law does not require this.\"  Id.\r                                                                         \r\n\nat 10.6\r\n\n          Whatever the meaning of   185c, its role within the\r\n\nscheme of Law 80 and  Law 80's relation to federal labor  law\r\n\nsuggest that Law 80 does not have the effect that McGaw seeks\r\n\nto give it.  First, as we  have previously noted, Law 80 does\r\n\nnot  require  an  employer to  use  plantwide  seniority, but\r\n\nmerely provides employees with an action for severance pay if\r\n\ndischarged  \"without good cause.\"   See Rodriguez  v. Eastern\r                                                                         \r\n\nAir  Lines, Inc.,  816 F.2d 24,  28 (1st  Cir. 1987).   Thus,\r                            \r\n\nwhether Law 80's  seniority provision, whatever  its meaning,\r\n\nhas been complied  with is relevant only to  the existence of\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  We also note, in passing, the Guidelines' advisory that:\r\n\n          if   the  skills   required  to   operate\r\n          machinery,  to  work  new designs  or  to\r\n          adapt  to  new procedures  can  be easily\r\n          acquired through a simple and inexpensive\r\n          training  the   employer  is   under  the\r\n          obligation to  provide said  training and\r\n          cannot  fire the  employees  who need  it\r\n          under penalty of  being responsible under\r\n          Law No. 80.\r\n\nId. at 18.  Insufficient facts have been adduced to determine\r               \r\nwhether this provision applies in this case, although it does\r\nsuggest that  McGaw may  have had some  duty to  re-train the\r\naffected LPCs.\r\n\n                             -23-\r\r\n\n\"good cause.\"   Law 80 does not, as  McGaw argues, require it\r\n\nto use plantwide  seniority, but at most merely  says that if\r\n\nit does  not,  it may  have to  provide severance  pay.   Cf.\r                                                                         \r\n\nRivera v. Security  Nat'l Life Ins. Co., 106  D.P.R. 517, 527\r                                                   \r\n\n(1977).  \"[B]ut an employer willing  to pay the price is free\r\n\nto discharge  whomever he  or she  pleases.\"  Rodriguez,  816\r                                                                   \r\n\nF.2d  at 28.    In  short, \"[a]lthough  Law  80 obviously  is\r\n\ndesigned  to  assist  those injured  by  arbitrary  discharge\r\n\npractices,  there is every  indication from its  language and\r\n\nother sources that  the legislature intended to  avoid direct\r\n\ninterference with  the employer's  business operation,\"  id.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nincluding its  seniority and  relocation  policies.   McGaw's\r\n\npractices  and statements indicate that, before the June 1994\r\n\nlayoff, it used  criteria other than plantwide  seniority and\r\n\nallowed  senior affected employees to  relocate.  It would be\r\n\nperverse indeed to  allow it now to invoke  a statute enacted\r\n\nfor the  protection of  workers as  a  justification for  its\r\n\nunlawful labor  practices.  Second,  the Guidelines  indicate\r\n\nthat \"if  [a] dismissal  of an  employee turns  out to  be an\r\n\nillegal work practice, the applicable  law is the Puerto Rico\r\n\nLabor Relations  Act or the National Labor  Relations Act, as\r\n\nthe case may  be.\"  Guidelines, 11.   Because McGaw's actions\r\n\nwere  unlawful  under  the latter,  that  is  the controlling\r\n\nauthority.  Finally, McGaw does not direct us to any case law\r\n\ninterpreting Law 80 in a manner helpful to its argument.\r\n\n                             -24-\r\r\n\n                       IV.  Conclusion\r\n\n          We  conclude  that,  because  substantial  evidence\r\n\nsupports  the Board's findings, its order should be enforced.\r\n\nThe  Board's findings  of  various   8(a)(1)  violations  are\r\n\nsummarily  affirmed, given McGaw's failure to challenge them.\r\n\nFurther, we  accept the  Board's conclusion that  substantial\r\n\nevidence indicates that the challenged layoffs were motivated\r\n\nprimarily   by    anti-union   animus   and    that   McGaw's\r\n\njustifications  for  the  particular  layoffs  at  issue  are\r\n\ninsufficient.    Although  McGaw may  have  had  a legitimate\r\n\nreason for the  LPC layoffs generally, it had  no such reason\r\n\nfor its changes in policy, which, together with the  layoffs,\r\n\nadversely affected  leading union activists and/or were taken\r\n\nto discourage  others from supporting  the Union.   Viewed in\r\n\nlight  of McGaw's  anti-union  animus,  we  have  no  trouble\r\n\naccepting   that    the   layoffs    constituted   unlawfully\r\n\ndiscriminatory  labor practices under the Act.  Given McGaw's\r\n\ncontention  that  the LPC  position no  longer exists  at its\r\n\nplant,  we leave  the issue  of  reinstatement to  compliance\r\n\nproceedings.7  Cf.

Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record supports the Board's findings<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> of the following facts, arranged chronologically.  McGaw has manufactured medical devices and related products at a plant in Sabana Grande, Puerto Rico, since 1974.  With about 1100 employees working three shifts at the plant, McGaw is one of the largest employers in the region.  The Congreso de Uniones Industriales de Puerto Rico (\"the Union\") has been trying to organize McGaw's Sabana Grande workers since 1992.  Several McGaw employees, including alleged discriminatees Charlie Silva, Vigdalia Rodriguez, and Lourdes Irizarry--all Line Production Clerks (\"LPCs\") at the Company--were active leaders in the Union's efforts.  Individually or as a group, they distributed union authorization cards at the plant, spoke to employees about the Union, acted as election observers, delivered speeches over loudspeakers in front of the plant, promoted the Union on a local radio program, wore prounion stickers, and held union meetings at their homes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Company reorganized its engineering department in 1992, eliminating, first, several mechanic positions and later, four LPC positions.  The affected employees were not laid off, but, instead, reassigned to other positions.  The Company advised them by memo that \"the elimination of these positions was carried out taking into consideration several factors such as general skills and abilities, seniority, attitude and others concerning general performance.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Union, by a narrow margin, won an election held in February 1993.  After 48 ballots were challenged, the parties stipulated to a second election, to be conducted on November 9 by the Board.  In the meantime, McGaw was undergoing significant operational reorganization.  Ira Marshall (\"Marshall\"), appointed General Manager at Sabana Grande in July 1993, found the existing operations a \"disorganized mess\" and set about a multi-million dollar overhaul of the plant's production system.  Central to the reorganization of the Company's operations was the phased replacement of its \"workcell\" production method with a conveyor belt system.  Under the workcell system, each employee completely assembled a given product.  LPCs liaised between supervisors and production employees, keeping track of production by performing largely clerical tasks.  Under the new conveyor system, each employee performed a discrete partial assembly step.  LPCs often worked the conveyor belt alongside production employees during the transition, although installation of the belts rendered obsolete much of their clerical responsibilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1993, the Company laid off some 140 employees as part of its restructuring.  Preceding the layoff, Human Resources Manager Alex Solla informed the employees by memo that \"[s]eniority (employment date) by classification and general performance are the criteria used in order to determine affected employees,\" and that \"hourly employees affected and having more seniority in the organization will be offered the opportunity of bumping/replace [sic] other employees with less seniority in Assembler I positions.\"   In the same month, the Company closed its sterilization department and transferred about ten affected employees to production.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the following month, McGaw installed its first conveyor belt.  Also, the Board conducted its second election, in which the Union failed to get a majority vote.  Weeks before the election, a Company supervisor had asked LPC Maria Belen whether she had been \"promoting the Union amongst the employees.\"   Company officials also asked her why she had not identified herself as a non-union employee by wearing a \"NO\" sticker, to which she replied that she considered herself a key person among employees and that wearing such a sticker might create friction within the Company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Restructuring continued in February 1994, the Company laying off close to twenty employees.  Also in February, the Company changed its LPC shift assignment policy from classification seniority to plantwide seniority.  The Company notified affected employees of its \"new change of policy\" by letter:  \"[p]ursuant to the seniority policy of our company, we have restructured the assignment of work shifts of the line production clerk position, in accordance to the date when the incumbents in such position began working at [the Company] (plant seniority).\"   LPCs Nilsa Nazario and Vigdalia Rodriguez, forced to take less desirable shifts, complained to management about the change and lack of prior notice.  At a February 28 meeting with a supervisor, Rodriguez asked about the change, and received the vague explanation that \"Company policy had changed a while back.\"Sometime in February or March, a supervisor asked LPC Raquel Gonzalez, a member of the \"Vote No\" group, to report to management any future union activity of LPC Lourdes Irizarry known to Gonzalez.  Gonzalez promised to comply, but never in fact reported anything about Irizarry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a conversation on or about March 10, Human Resources Manager Solla told LPC Silva that he and other employees \"were mistaken with the union idea because if Sabana Grande had been a large town, the Union would have won.  But since Sabana Grande was a small town, it was a town with people with small minds.  And that it would be easy for the Company to scare people and get them to vote against the Union.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime in April, Production Superintendent Geraldo Gonzalez asked LPC Belen \"what kind of comments [she] had overheard about the Union.\"   He later told her that if the Union \"came back,\" McGaw's owners would not fight the Union, but rather would close the plant without warning and without paying workers for their final week of work.  Gonzalez further added that \"the people that were laid off for that reason would not be able to get work from other companies because they would know that the reason for the layoff was because of unions.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It became clear to Company management sometime during the first half of 1994 that personnel changes would accompany the production transition.  In a May 18 memo to Solla, Marshall indicated his views as to the need for \"less unskilled people\" under the conveyor system, the need to establish a \"new more technical and flat organization,\" and the need to replace \"many people that cannot adapt to the technology.\"   He instructed Solla to meet with Operations Manager Juan Luis Santa to \"develop a tentative plan to organize and upgrade our human technical expertise ... [and that] this should be done by 610/94 [sic].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Around the same time, the Union campaigned for a third election.  Union president Jose Figueroa, along with LPCs Silva and Irizarry and mechanic Juan Vargas, arranged for a May 29 meeting of prounion employees, held at a local beach.  A McGaw supervisor stood within visual range of the meeting, and an employee who was in the \"Vote No\" group also was seen nearby.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Management memos and documents dated shortly after the May 29 Union meeting confirm the Company's determination to eliminate LPC positions.  In a June 8 memo to his supervisor, Gary Sielski, Marshall indicated the anticipated elimination of 10 LPC positions, stating that \"[t]he objective will be to discharge people by performance, educational training, and seniority.  We are doing this ... [because] [w]e need people with the discipline to manage the [conveyor] system.  They must also have the education to learn to use the system and perform additional reporting and record keeping.\"   In a memo to Marshall the following day, Operations Manager Santa stated that he had requested Human Resources Manager Solla to \"reduce ten (10) production line clerks, based on performance, academic background, and seniority,\" with the direction that the reduction occur no later than the end of June.  On June 13, Marshall submitted a \"Monthly Activity Report\" to Sielski, setting forth the Company's activities, plans, and priorities, and identifying the elimination of the \"union threat\" as one of the Company's priorities.  The Report also stated the Company's plans to \"hire 39 people, 29 for increased production and 10 for backlogged rework.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about June 22, Company officials, including Marshall, Solla, and Employee Relations Manager Miriam Figueroa, met with employees.  According to LPC Rodriguez, Marshall stated that \"he did not want third parties involved in the plant with them because [the employees] could talk with them, or dialogue with them.\"   She further testified that Marshall stated that \"neither the employees nor the supervisors needed to talk about the Union, that the only people that could talk about Unions were himself and Alex Solla.\"   LPC Silva testified that Marshall stated that the Company had a lot of money to invest in employee salaries and benefits, and that he \"didn't want third parties to come in order to obtain those benefits for the employees.\"   Silva recalled that Marshall said he \"did not want to hear employees talking in the hallways, whether it be pro or con, for or against the Union, and that if there needed to be any Union talk in McGaw it would be done between himself and Alex Solla in his office.\"   Silva also testified that Marshall told the employees that \"things were looking good\" at the company, that sales were up, and that \"at the moment there were no plans to fire or dismiss anybody.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marshall claimed that, because emotions about the Union were running high, he stressed to the employees at the meeting that \"no one was to be threatening anyone ... for supporting or not supporting the Union.\"   He claimed that it was Solla rather than he who told the employees that only he and Solla were authorized to discuss the Union, and that the statement referred to those management officials who were authorized to speak on behalf of the Company regarding the Union.  Figueroa testified that Marshall informed the employees that he would not allow any threats among employees, and that anyone who felt threatened should speak with Solla or him.  Figueroa's testimony was consistent with Marshall's insofar as it was Solla who had said that the only management representatives allowed to \"make any updates on the Union\" were Marshall and Solla.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barely more than a week later, on June 30, the Company laid off nine LPCs. The nine were laid off without warning, and strictly according to plantwide seniority rather than the manifold criteria listed in the Marshall and Santa memos.  Marshall testified that Santa, rather than he, was responsible for the change, and claimed that Santa and Solla had met with the Company's legal counsel, who advised them to \"just stick with Law 80\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and go by \"length of service.\"   Company officials conducted layoff interviews with the affected employees, who were told that the layoffs were due to restructuring.  Several asked about being transferred to other positions, as had been the Company's past practice.  They were told, variously, that \"Company policy had changed, and that they would no longer be doing it that way,\" \"Company policy is that if a job classification is eliminated, there is no chance of relocation,\" \"Company policy was no longer to relocate people in lower positions, and that the policy had changed,\" and \"we don't have any openings at that time, and if we do that, we would be violating Law 80.\"   Following the June layoff, the Company hired about 50 \"temporary\" production employees, and would have refused to rehire any of the laid-off employees as temporary employees had they asked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Company installed two additional conveyor belts in July 1994, and two more in April 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

The complaint further alleged that McGaw violated Section 8(a)(3)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> of the Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 158(a)(3), by changing its seniority policy from classification to plantwide seniority and by laying off nine LPCs on June 30 because they joined and assisted the Union, and/or to discourage employees from engaging in Union activities.  Named as discriminatees in the complaint were LPCs Jose Luis Pacheco, Francisco Jusino, Raquel Gonzalez, Scipio Vega, Lourdes Irizarry, Maria Belen, Charlie Silva, Vigdalia Rodriguez, and Nilsa Nazario.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Company denied the allegations.

Following these findings was a detailed remedy and recommended order.  McGaw timely excepted, and a three member panel of the Board affirmed the ALJ's rulings, findings, and conclusions, and adopted his order with slight modification.  The Board ordered McGaw to cease and desist, and to reinstate and make whole those unlawfully laid off.

By failing to contest these findings, McGaw has waived its right to object to them as erroneous.  See Horizon Air Servs., 761 F.2d at 26.   Further, the unlawful practices underlying these uncontested findings \"do not disappear by not being mentioned in [McGaw's] brief,\" but rather remain to inform our consideration of the Board's other findings.  NLRB v. Clark Manor Nursing Home Corp., 671 F.2d 657, 660 (1st Cir.1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Section 8(a)(3) Violations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is an unfair labor practice \"for an employer by discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization.\"  29 U.S.C. &#167; 158(a)(3).  Whether an employer's action adverse to employees is a &#167; 8(a)(3) violation turns on the employer's primary motivation.  See generally NLRB v. Transportation Management Corp., 462 U.S. 393, 397-403, 103 S.Ct. 2469, 2472-75, 76 L.Ed.2d 667 (1983).  If the goal is to discourage union activity, there is a violation.  If there is no anti-union motive, or if the same action would have been taken based on some other, non-discriminatory, motive, there is no violation.  Motive may be inferred from both direct and circumstantial evidence.  See NLRB v. Pilgrim Foods, Inc., 591 F.2d 110, 118 (1st Cir.1978).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The General Counsel makes a prima facie showing of unlawful discrimination by establishing:  (i) protected activity by employees;  (ii) the employer's knowledge of this activity;  (iii) the employer's animus toward unions;  and (iv) a causal connection between the animus and the action taken against employees.  See Carry Cos. of Illinois, Inc. v. NLRB, 30 F.3d 922, 927 (7th Cir.1994);  see also Pilgrim Foods, 591 F.2d at 118.   In other words, the General Counsel must prove at the outset that \"the employee's protected conduct was a substantial or motivating factor for the discharge\" or other adverse action.  Horizon Air Servs., 761 F.2d at 27.   The burden then shifts to the employer to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that it had another motive that was both legitimate (non-pretextual and based on other than protected conduct) and primary (would have produced the same outcome regardless of the protected activity).  See Transportation Management, 462 U.S. at 400-05, 103 S.Ct. at 2473-75;  see also, e.g., Horizon Air Servs., 761 F.2d at 27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Doggedly, McGaw attacks each element of the prima facie case.  It first contends that not all of those laid off engaged in protected activities, and that laying off the nine LPCs did not eliminate all of the Union's active supporters, some of whom were not LPCs. McGaw demands more than is required.  Some of those laid off--Irizarry, Silva, and Rodriguez--clearly were among the Union's most ardent supporters, and the Company need not lay off all union supporters at once to violate &#167; 8(a)(3).  See NLRB v. Instrument Corp. of Am., 714 F.2d 324, 330 (4th Cir.1983).  Ordering layoffs \"for the purpose of discouraging union activity or in retaliation against ... employees because of the union activities of some\" violates &#167; 8(a)(3), even if some of those laid off were neutral or even against the union.  Birch Run Welding &amp; Fabricating, Inc. v. NLRB, 761 F.2d 1175, 1180 (6th Cir.1985);  see also Merchants Truck Line, Inc. v. NLRB, 577 F.2d 1011, 1016 (5th Cir.1978).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McGaw then claims it did not know of the union activities of those laid off, and in any case, harbored no anti-union sentiment.  This strains credibility.  LPCs Rodriguez, Irizarry, and Silva each were overt and active Union supporters, both within and without the plant.  Before the ALJ, Company officials admitted to knowing as much and to observing union activity at the plant.  Further, McGaw failed to explain credited allegations that Company officials solicited an employee to spy and report on Irizarry's union activities and, barely a month before the June layoffs, observed the Union meeting at the beach where Silva and Irizarry were present.  Also, McGaw's denial of anti-union animus falls flat in light of Marshall's comments about dissolving the \"union threat\" and keeping \"third parties\" out of the plant, the Company's attempts to spy on Irizarry and to intimidate union supporters through interrogation and various threats, the Company's interrogation of LPC Belen as to her Union sentiments, as well as the Company's prohibition of discussion of the Union among employees.  Substantial evidence supports the Board's findings of both knowledge and anti-union animus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Closing its assault on the General Counsel's prima facie case, McGaw argues that, because both Union and Company supporters were laid off, a sufficient causal connection between any anti-union animus and its actions is absent.  As noted, adverse action may be unlawfully discriminatory whether or not all union adherents suffer at once.  See Birch Run Welding &amp; Fabricating, 761 F.2d at 1180;  Merchants Truck Line, 577 F.2d at 1016.   In any case, McGaw misses the mark;  it is the departure from past Company practices, in combination with the LPC layoffs, that the Board found to be a violation.  It is undisputed that, had McGaw used classification seniority to effectuate the June layoffs, LPCs Irizarry, Rodriguez, and Belen would not have been laid off.  Also, McGaw inexplicably departed from its past practice of relocating, rather than laying off, workers when a position was phased out.  This occurred at a time when its managers expressed the need for \"less unskilled people\" under the conveyor system and more people with the \"education to learn to use the system and perform additional reporting and record keeping,\" and at a time when it planned to hire about 40 people for production and rework (and in fact hired about 50 \"temporary\" production employees following the layoff).  These facts, together with McGaw's knowledge of Irizarry's and Rodriguez's union activities, its suspicion of Belen's union sentiments, and its anti-union animosity, support the Board's inference that McGaw changed its LPC seniority policy in February 1994 if not to discriminate immediately against union supporters then to lay the groundwork for the eventual termination of key union leaders in the LPC position.  We reject McGaw's position that no causal connection existed, and instead accept the Board's conclusion that such adverse action, calculated to affect key Union leaders, unlawfully discriminated against Union activists and/or was taken to discourage others from supporting the Union.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prepared for rejection of its first round of argument, McGaw responds that legitimate business reasons would have led it to lay off the nine LPCs, regardless of any union animosity.  The Board accepted that the Company's production transition inevitably would render obsolete many of the LPCs' traditional functions, and we do not disagree.  But again, McGaw misses the point.  The issue is not whether McGaw had a primary nondiscriminatory reason for the layoffs generally, but rather whether it had such a reason to depart from its past practices, departures which appear to have been calculated to adversely impact employees engaged in protected activities.  See Birch Run Welding &amp; Fabricating, 761 F.2d at 1181 (noting that \"an employer's deviation from past practice\" is persuasive evidence of an unlawful motive);  cf.  Transportation Management Corp., 462 U.S. at 404, 103 S.Ct. at 2475 (highlighting employer's departure from its usual practice);  Hunter Douglas, Inc. v. NLRB, 804 F.2d 808, 814 (3d Cir.1986) (same), cert. denied, 481 U.S. 1069, 107 S.Ct. 2461, 95 L.Ed.2d 870 (1987);  Merchants Truck Line, 577 F.2d at 1016 (same).  To this, McGaw persistently but rather lamely maintains that it never changed policies at all.  We must reject this;  not only do the Company's past practices and statements, recounted above, indicate the opposite, but the ALJ found McGaw's sole witness on this issue--Miriam Figueroa--not to be credible.  The Board did not disturb this credibility finding;  nor do we.  Thus, McGaw's explanation for the layoffs, although plausibly non-discriminatory, does not explain why the Company changed its seniority and relocation policies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, McGaw points to Puerto Rico Public Law 80, 29 L.P.R.A. &#167; 185a-m (\"Law 80\"), as requiring it to make layoffs according to plantwide seniority.  Despite the weight of the evidence, McGaw maintains that it has always used plantwide seniority, in accordance with Law 80, in effectuating layoffs.  Its unstated argument, apparently, is that even if this is found not true, its switch to plantwide seniority from classification seniority was nondiscriminatory because Law 80 required the change.  The Board did not agree;  nor do we.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Law 80 entitles employees who are discharged \"without good cause\" to severance compensation, calculated in part by years of service.  See &#167; 185a.  \"Good cause,\" in turn, includes the full, temporary, or partial closing of the employer's operations, &#167; 185b(d), technological or reorganization changes, &#167; 185b(e), and reductions in employment made necessary by a reduction in the anticipated or prevailing volume of production, sales, or profits at the time of the discharge, &#167; 185b(f).  In any of these three circumstances, the employer has a</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>duty ... to retain those employees of greater seniority on the job with preference, provided there are positions vacant or filled by employees of less seniority in the job within their occupational classification which may be held by them ... except ... in those cases in which there is a clear and conclusive difference in favor of the efficiency or capacity of the workers compared, in which case the capacity shall prevail....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&#167; 185c.  McGaw clings to this provision as a statutory command to use plantwide, rather than classification, seniority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The meaning of &#167; 185c is less than clear.  The word \"job\" could refer to employment generally (i.e., \"plantwide\"), or to employment in a specific position.  The Guidelines for the Interpretation and Application of Law 80, May 30, 1976 (\"Guidelines\"), promulgated by the Puerto Rico Department of Labor and Human Resources, indicate the former, although they are nevertheless ambiguous as to the meaning of &#167; 185c.  On the one hand, the Guidelines say:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>If there is a need to dismiss employees within any or some occupational classifications, the employer will be obligated to retain with preference in said classifications the employees with the greatest seniority in the company, and to that effect all the time worked continuously and uninterruptedly for the company will be considered, regardless of the occupational classifications where they were performed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Guidelines, 9 (emphasis added).  On the other hand, the Guidelines say:  \"When the employer needs to lay off workers ... he does not necessarily have to do so following an order of seniority since the law does not require this.\"  Id. at 10.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever the meaning of &#167; 185c, its role within the scheme of Law 80 and Law 80's relation to federal labor law suggest that Law 80 does not have the effect that McGaw seeks to give it.  First, as we have previously noted, Law 80 does not require an employer to use plantwide seniority, but merely provides employees with an action for severance pay if discharged \"without good cause.\"   See Rodriguez v. Eastern Air Lines, Inc., 816 F.2d 24, 28 (1st Cir.1987).  Thus, whether Law 80's seniority provision, whatever its meaning, has been complied with is relevant only to the existence of \"good cause.\"   Law 80 does not, as McGaw argues, require it to use plantwide seniority, but at most merely says that if it does not, it may have to provide severance pay.  Cf. Rivera v. Security Nat'l Life Ins. Co., 106 D.P.R. 517, 527, 1977 WL 50774 (1977).  \"[B]ut an employer willing to pay the price is free to discharge whomever he or she pleases.\"  Rodriguez, 816 F.2d at 28.   In short, \"[a]lthough Law 80 obviously is designed to assist those injured by arbitrary discharge practices, there is every indication from its language and other sources that the legislature intended to avoid direct interference with the employer's business operation,\" id., including its seniority and relocation policies.  McGaw's practices and statements indicate that, before the June 1994 layoff, it used criteria other than plantwide seniority and allowed senior affected employees to relocate.  It would be perverse indeed to allow it now to invoke a statute enacted for the protection of workers as a justification for its unlawful labor practices.  Second, the Guidelines indicate that \"if [a] dismissal of an employee turns out to be an illegal work practice, the applicable law is the Puerto Rico Labor Relations Act or the National Labor Relations Act, as the case may be.\"   Guidelines, 11.  Because McGaw's actions were unlawful under the latter, that is the controlling authority.  Finally, McGaw does not direct us to any case law interpreting Law 80 in a manner helpful to its argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that, because substantial evidence supports the Board's findings, its order should be enforced.  The Board's findings of various &#167; 8(a)(1) violations are summarily affirmed, given McGaw's failure to challenge them.  Further, we accept the Board's conclusion that substantial evidence indicates that the challenged layoffs were motivated primarily by anti-union animus and that McGaw's justifications for the particular layoffs at issue are insufficient.  Although McGaw may have had a legitimate reason for the LPC layoffs generally, it had no such reason for its changes in policy, which, together with the layoffs, adversely affected leading union activists and/or were taken to discourage others from supporting the Union.  Viewed in light of McGaw's anti-union animus, we have no trouble accepting that the layoffs constituted unlawfully discriminatory labor practices under the Act.  Given McGaw's contention that the LPC position no longer exists at its plant, we leave the issue of reinstatement to compliance proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Cf.

(\"McGaw\" or \"the Company\") engaged in various unfair labor practices in violation of Sections 8(a)(1) and (3) of the National Labor Relations Act (\"the Act\").  McGaw responds that substantial evidence does not support the Board's findings that it unlawfully discriminated against employees because of their engagement in union activities and/or to discourage others from such engagement.  We disagree, and grant the request for enforcement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record supports the Board's findings<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> of the following facts, arranged chronologically.  McGaw has manufactured medical devices and related products at a plant in Sabana Grande, Puerto Rico, since 1974.  With about 1100 employees working three shifts at the plant, McGaw is one of the largest employers in the region.  The Congreso de Uniones Industriales de Puerto Rico (\"the Union\") has been trying to organize McGaw's Sabana Grande workers since 1992.  Several McGaw employees, including alleged discriminatees Charlie Silva, Vigdalia Rodriguez, and Lourdes Irizarry--all Line Production Clerks (\"LPCs\") at the Company--were active leaders in the Union's efforts.  Individually or as a group, they distributed union authorization cards at the plant, spoke to employees about the Union, acted as election observers, delivered speeches over loudspeakers in front of the plant, promoted the Union on a local radio program, wore prounion stickers, and held union meetings at their homes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Company reorganized its engineering department in 1992, eliminating, first, several mechanic positions and later, four LPC positions.  The affected employees were not laid off, but, instead, reassigned to other positions.  The Company advised them by memo that \"the elimination of these positions was carried out taking into consideration several factors such as general skills and abilities, seniority, attitude and others concerning general performance.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Union, by a narrow margin, won an election held in February 1993.  After 48 ballots were challenged, the parties stipulated to a second election, to be conducted on November 9 by the Board.  In the meantime, McGaw was undergoing significant operational reorganization.  Ira Marshall (\"Marshall\"), appointed General Manager at Sabana Grande in July 1993, found the existing operations a \"disorganized mess\" and set about a multi-million dollar overhaul of the plant's production system.  Central to the reorganization of the Company's operations was the phased replacement of its \"workcell\" production method with a conveyor belt system.  Under the workcell system, each employee completely assembled a given product.  LPCs liaised between supervisors and production employees, keeping track of production by performing largely clerical tasks.  Under the new conveyor system, each employee performed a discrete partial assembly step.  LPCs often worked the conveyor belt alongside production employees during the transition, although installation of the belts rendered obsolete much of their clerical responsibilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1993, the Company laid off some 140 employees as part of its restructuring.  Preceding the layoff, Human Resources Manager Alex Solla informed the employees by memo that \"[s]eniority (employment date) by classification and general performance are the criteria used in order to determine affected employees,\" and that \"hourly employees affected and having more seniority in the organization will be offered the opportunity of bumping/replace [sic] other employees with less seniority in Assembler I positions.\"   In the same month, the Company closed its sterilization department and transferred about ten affected employees to production.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the following month, McGaw installed its first conveyor belt.  Also, the Board conducted its second election, in which the Union failed to get a majority vote.  Weeks before the election, a Company supervisor had asked LPC Maria Belen whether she had been \"promoting the Union amongst the employees.\"   Company officials also asked her why she had not identified herself as a non-union employee by wearing a \"NO\" sticker, to which she replied that she considered herself a key person among employees and that wearing such a sticker might create friction within the Company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Restructuring continued in February 1994, the Company laying off close to twenty employees.  Also in February, the Company changed its LPC shift assignment policy from classification seniority to plantwide seniority.  The Company notified affected employees of its \"new change of policy\" by letter:  \"[p]ursuant to the seniority policy of our company, we have restructured the assignment of work shifts of the line production clerk position, in accordance to the date when the incumbents in such position began working at [the Company] (plant seniority).\"   LPCs Nilsa Nazario and Vigdalia Rodriguez, forced to take less desirable shifts, complained to management about the change and lack of prior notice.  At a February 28 meeting with a supervisor, Rodriguez asked about the change, and received the vague explanation that \"Company policy had changed a while back.\"Sometime in February or March, a supervisor asked LPC Raquel Gonzalez, a member of the \"Vote No\" group, to report to management any future union activity of LPC Lourdes Irizarry known to Gonzalez.  Gonzalez promised to comply, but never in fact reported anything about Irizarry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a conversation on or about March 10, Human Resources Manager Solla told LPC Silva that he and other employees \"were mistaken with the union idea because if Sabana Grande had been a large town, the Union would have won.  But since Sabana Grande was a small town, it was a town with people with small minds.  And that it would be easy for the Company to scare people and get them to vote against the Union.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometime in April, Production Superintendent Geraldo Gonzalez asked LPC Belen \"what kind of comments [she] had overheard about the Union.\"   He later told her that if the Union \"came back,\" McGaw's owners would not fight the Union, but rather would close the plant without warning and without paying workers for their final week of work.  Gonzalez further added that \"the people that were laid off for that reason would not be able to get work from other companies because they would know that the reason for the layoff was because of unions.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It became clear to Company management sometime during the first half of 1994 that personnel changes would accompany the production transition.  In a May 18 memo to Solla, Marshall indicated his views as to the need for \"less unskilled people\" under the conveyor system, the need to establish a \"new more technical and flat organization,\" and the need to replace \"many people that cannot adapt to the technology.\"   He instructed Solla to meet with Operations Manager Juan Luis Santa to \"develop a tentative plan to organize and upgrade our human technical expertise ... [and that] this should be done by 610/94 [sic].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Around the same time, the Union campaigned for a third election.  Union president Jose Figueroa, along with LPCs Silva and Irizarry and mechanic Juan Vargas, arranged for a May 29 meeting of prounion employees, held at a local beach.  A McGaw supervisor stood within visual range of the meeting, and an employee who was in the \"Vote No\" group also was seen nearby.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Management memos and documents dated shortly after the May 29 Union meeting confirm the Company's determination to eliminate LPC positions.  In a June 8 memo to his supervisor, Gary Sielski, Marshall indicated the anticipated elimination of 10 LPC positions, stating that \"[t]he objective will be to discharge people by performance, educational training, and seniority.  We are doing this ... [because] [w]e need people with the discipline to manage the [conveyor] system.  They must also have the education to learn to use the system and perform additional reporting and record keeping.\"   In a memo to Marshall the following day, Operations Manager Santa stated that he had requested Human Resources Manager Solla to \"reduce ten (10) production line clerks, based on performance, academic background, and seniority,\" with the direction that the reduction occur no later than the end of June.  On June 13, Marshall submitted a \"Monthly Activity Report\" to Sielski, setting forth the Company's activities, plans, and priorities, and identifying the elimination of the \"union threat\" as one of the Company's priorities.  The Report also stated the Company's plans to \"hire 39 people, 29 for increased production and 10 for backlogged rework.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about June 22, Company officials, including Marshall, Solla, and Employee Relations Manager Miriam Figueroa, met with employees.  According to LPC Rodriguez, Marshall stated that \"he did not want third parties involved in the plant with them because [the employees] could talk with them, or dialogue with them.\"   She further testified that Marshall stated that \"neither the employees nor the supervisors needed to talk about the Union, that the only people that could talk about Unions were himself and Alex Solla.\"   LPC Silva testified that Marshall stated that the Company had a lot of money to invest in employee salaries and benefits, and that he \"didn't want third parties to come in order to obtain those benefits for the employees.\"   Silva recalled that Marshall said he \"did not want to hear employees talking in the hallways, whether it be pro or con, for or against the Union, and that if there needed to be any Union talk in McGaw it would be done between himself and Alex Solla in his office.\"   Silva also testified that Marshall told the employees that \"things were looking good\" at the company, that sales were up, and that \"at the moment there were no plans to fire or dismiss anybody.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marshall claimed that, because emotions about the Union were running high, he stressed to the employees at the meeting that \"no one was to be threatening anyone ... for supporting or not supporting the Union.\"   He claimed that it was Solla rather than he who told the employees that only he and Solla were authorized to discuss the Union, and that the statement referred to those management officials who were authorized to speak on behalf of the Company regarding the Union.  Figueroa testified that Marshall informed the employees that he would not allow any threats among employees, and that anyone who felt threatened should speak with Solla or him.  Figueroa's testimony was consistent with Marshall's insofar as it was Solla who had said that the only management representatives allowed to \"make any updates on the Union\" were Marshall and Solla.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barely more than a week later, on June 30, the Company laid off nine LPCs. The nine were laid off without warning, and strictly according to plantwide seniority rather than the manifold criteria listed in the Marshall and Santa memos.  Marshall testified that Santa, rather than he, was responsible for the change, and claimed that Santa and Solla had met with the Company's legal counsel, who advised them to \"just stick with Law 80\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and go by \"length of service.\"   Company officials conducted layoff interviews with the affected employees, who were told that the layoffs were due to restructuring.  Several asked about being transferred to other positions, as had been the Company's past practice.  They were told, variously, that \"Company policy had changed, and that they would no longer be doing it that way,\" \"Company policy is that if a job classification is eliminated, there is no chance of relocation,\" \"Company policy was no longer to relocate people in lower positions, and that the policy had changed,\" and \"we don't have any openings at that time, and if we do that, we would be violating Law 80.\"   Following the June layoff, the Company hired about 50 \"temporary\" production employees, and would have refused to rehire any of the laid-off employees as temporary employees had they asked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Company installed two additional conveyor belts in July 1994, and two more in April 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Procedural Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to charges filed by the Union, the Board issued a complaint and notice of hearing on March 24, 1995.  The complaint alleged that McGaw violated Section 8(a)(1)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> of the National Labor Relations Act (\"the Act\"), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 158(a)(1), by soliciting employees to spy on and report other employees' union activities, expressing to employees the futility of engaging in union activities by telling them it was easy to instill fear in them so that they would vote against the Union, interrogating an employee concerning the Union's activities at the Company's plant, threatening employees with plant closure and loss of wages if they supported the Union, threatening to \"blackball\" employees regarding future employment opportunities if they supported the Union, and prohibiting employees from talking about the Union at the plant.  The complaint further alleged that McGaw violated Section 8(a)(3)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> of the Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 158(a)(3), by changing its seniority policy from classification to plantwide seniority and by laying off nine LPCs on June 30 because they joined and assisted the Union, and/or to discourage employees from engaging in Union activities.  Named as discriminatees in the complaint were LPCs Jose Luis Pacheco, Francisco Jusino, Raquel Gonzalez, Scipio Vega, Lourdes Irizarry, Maria Belen, Charlie Silva, Vigdalia Rodriguez, and Nilsa Nazario.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Company denied the allegations.  After a full hearing, the administrative law judge (\"the ALJ\") sustained each of the Union's allegations, finding as a matter of law that McGaw had violated Sections 8(a)(1) and (3) of the Act.  Following these findings was a detailed remedy and recommended order.  McGaw timely excepted, and a three member panel of the Board affirmed the ALJ's rulings, findings, and conclusions, and adopted his order with slight modification.  The Board ordered McGaw to cease and desist, and to reinstate and make whole those unlawfully laid off.  We have jurisdiction over McGaw's appeal pursuant to Sections 10(e) and (f) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 160(e) and (f).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Discussion</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">667</span></a></span> (1983).  If the goal is to discourage union activity, there is a violation.  If there is no anti-union motive, or if the same action would have been taken based on some other, non-discriminatory, motive, there is no violation.  Motive may be inferred from both direct and circumstantial evidence.  See NLRB v. Pilgrim Foods, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"362991\"><a href=\"/opinion/362991/national-labor-relations-board-v-pilgrim-foods-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">591</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span></a></span>, 118 (1st Cir.1978).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The General Counsel makes a prima facie showing of unlawful discrimination by establishing:  (i) protected activity by employees;  (ii) the employer's knowledge of this activity;  (iii) the employer's animus toward unions;  and (iv) a causal connection between the animus and the action taken against employees.  See Carry Cos. of Illinois, Inc. v.

In other words, the General Counsel must prove at the outset that \"the employee's protected conduct was a substantial or motivating factor for the discharge\" or other adverse action.  Horizon Air Servs., 761 F.2d at 27.   The burden then shifts to the employer to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that it had another motive that was both legitimate (non-pretextual and based on other than protected conduct) and primary (would have produced the same outcome regardless of the protected activity).  See Transportation Management, 462 U.S. at 400-05, 103 S.Ct. at 2473-75;  see also, e.g., Horizon Air Servs., 761 F.2d at 27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Doggedly, McGaw attacks each element of the prima facie case.  It first contends that not all of those laid off engaged in protected activities, and that laying off the nine LPCs did not eliminate all of the Union's active supporters, some of whom were not LPCs. McGaw demands more than is required.  Some of those laid off--Irizarry, Silva, and Rodriguez--clearly were among the Union's most ardent supporters, and the Company need not lay off all union supporters at once to violate &#167; 8(a)(3).  See NLRB v. Instrument Corp. of Am., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"423518\"><a href=\"/opinion/423518/national-labor-relations-board-v-instrument-corporation-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">714</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">324</span></a></span>, 330 (4th Cir.1983).  Ordering layoffs \"for the purpose of discouraging union activity or in retaliation against ... employees because of the union activities of some\" violates &#167; 8(a)(3), even if some of those laid off were neutral or even against the union.  Birch Run Welding &amp; Fabricating, Inc. v. NLRB, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"451925\"><a href=\"/opinion/451925/birch-run-welding-fabricating-inc-v-national-labor-relations-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">761</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1175</span></a></span>, 1180 (6th Cir.1985);  see also Merchants Truck Line, Inc. v.

This strains credibility.  LPCs Rodriguez, Irizarry, and Silva each were overt and active Union supporters, both within and without the plant.  Before the ALJ, Company officials admitted to knowing as much and to observing union activity at the plant.  Further, McGaw failed to explain credited allegations that Company officials solicited an employee to spy and report on Irizarry's union activities and, barely a month before the June layoffs, observed the Union meeting at the beach where Silva and Irizarry were present.  Also, McGaw's denial of anti-union animus falls flat in light of Marshall's comments about dissolving the \"union threat\" and keeping \"third parties\" out of the plant, the Company's attempts to spy on Irizarry and to intimidate union supporters through interrogation and various threats, the Company's interrogation of LPC Belen as to her Union sentiments, as well as the Company's prohibition of discussion of the Union among employees.  Substantial evidence supports the Board's findings of both knowledge and anti-union animus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Closing its assault on the General Counsel's prima facie case, McGaw argues that, because both Union and Company supporters were laid off, a sufficient causal connection between any anti-union animus and its actions is absent.  As noted, adverse action may be unlawfully discriminatory whether or not all union adherents suffer at once.  See Birch Run Welding &amp; Fabricating, 761 F.2d at 1180;  Merchants Truck Line, 577 F.2d at 1016.   In any case, McGaw misses the mark;  it is the departure from past Company practices, in combination with the LPC layoffs, that the Board found to be a violation.  It is undisputed that, had McGaw used classification seniority to effectuate the June layoffs, LPCs Irizarry, Rodriguez, and Belen would not have been laid off.  Also, McGaw inexplicably departed from its past practice of relocating, rather than laying off, workers when a position was phased out.  This occurred at a time when its managers expressed the need for \"less unskilled people\" under the conveyor system and more people with the \"education to learn to use the system and perform additional reporting and record keeping,\" and at a time when it planned to hire about 40 people for production and rework (and in fact hired about 50 \"temporary\" production employees following the layoff).  These facts, together with McGaw's knowledge of Irizarry's and Rodriguez's union activities, its suspicion of Belen's union sentiments, and its anti-union animosity, support the Board's inference that McGaw changed its LPC seniority policy in February 1994 if not to discriminate immediately against union supporters then to lay the groundwork for the eventual termination of key union leaders in the LPC position.  We reject McGaw's position that no causal connection existed, and instead accept the Board's conclusion that such adverse action, calculated to affect key Union leaders, unlawfully discriminated against Union activists and/or was taken to discourage others from supporting the Union.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prepared for rejection of its first round of argument, McGaw responds that legitimate business reasons would have led it to lay off the nine LPCs, regardless of any union animosity.  The Board accepted that the Company's production transition inevitably would render obsolete many of the LPCs' traditional functions, and we do not disagree.  But again, McGaw misses the point.  The issue is not whether McGaw had a primary nondiscriminatory reason for the layoffs generally, but rather whether it had such a reason to depart from its past practices, departures which appear to have been calculated to adversely impact employees engaged in protected activities.  See Birch Run Welding &amp; Fabricating, 761 F.2d at 1181 (noting that \"an employer's deviation from past practice\" is persuasive evidence of an unlawful motive);  cf.  Transportation Management Corp., 462 U.S. at 404, 103 S.Ct. at 2475 (highlighting employer's departure from its usual practice);  Hunter Douglas, Inc. v. NLRB, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"478952\"><a href=\"/opinion/478952/hunter-douglas-inc-v-national-labor-relations-board-hunter-douglas/\"><span class=\"volume\">804</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></a></span>, 814 (3d Cir.1986) (same), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1069</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">870</span></span> (1987);  Merchants Truck Line, 577 F.2d at 1016 (same).  To this, McGaw persistently but rather lamely maintains that it never changed policies at all.  We must reject this;  not only do the Company's past practices and statements, recounted above, indicate the opposite, but the ALJ found McGaw's sole witness on this issue--Miriam Figueroa--not to be credible.  The Board did not disturb this credibility finding;  nor do we.  Thus, McGaw's explanation for the layoffs, although plausibly non-discriminatory, does not explain why the Company changed its seniority and relocation policies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, McGaw points to Puerto Rico Public Law 80, 29 L.P.R.A. &#167; 185a-m (\"Law 80\"), as requiring it to make layoffs according to plantwide seniority.  Despite the weight of the evidence, McGaw maintains that it has always used plantwide seniority, in accordance with Law 80, in effectuating layoffs.  Its unstated argument, apparently, is that even if this is found not true, its switch to plantwide seniority from classification seniority was nondiscriminatory because Law 80 required the change.  The Board did not agree;  nor do we.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Law 80 entitles employees who are discharged \"without good cause\" to severance compensation, calculated in part by years of service.  See &#167; 185a.  \"Good cause,\" in turn, includes the full, temporary, or partial closing of the employer's operations, &#167; 185b(d), technological or reorganization changes, &#167; 185b(e), and reductions in employment made necessary by a reduction in the anticipated or prevailing volume of production, sales, or profits at the time of the discharge, &#167; 185b(f).  In any of these three circumstances, the employer has a</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>duty ... to retain those employees of greater seniority on the job with preference, provided there are positions vacant or filled by employees of less seniority in the job within their occupational classification which may be held by them ... except ... in those cases in which there is a clear and conclusive difference in favor of the efficiency or capacity of the workers compared, in which case the capacity shall prevail....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&#167; 185c.  McGaw clings to this provision as a statutory command to use plantwide, rather than classification, seniority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The meaning of &#167; 185c is less than clear.  The word \"job\" could refer to employment generally (i.e., \"plantwide\"), or to employment in a specific position.  The Guidelines for the Interpretation and Application of Law 80, May 30, 1976 (\"Guidelines\"), promulgated by the Puerto Rico Department of Labor and Human Resources, indicate the former, although they are nevertheless ambiguous as to the meaning of &#167; 185c.  On the one hand, the Guidelines say:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>If there is a need to dismiss employees within any or some occupational classifications, the employer will be obligated to retain with preference in said classifications the employees with the greatest seniority in the company, and to that effect all the time worked continuously and uninterruptedly for the company will be considered, regardless of the occupational classifications where they were performed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Guidelines, 9 (emphasis added).  On the other hand, the Guidelines say:  \"When the employer needs to lay off workers ... he does not necessarily have to do so following an order of seniority since the law does not require this.\"  Id. at 10.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever the meaning of &#167; 185c, its role within the scheme of Law 80 and Law 80's relation to federal labor law suggest that Law 80 does not have the effect that McGaw seeks to give it.  First, as we have previously noted, Law 80 does not require an employer to use plantwide seniority, but merely provides employees with an action for severance pay if discharged \"without good cause.\"   See Rodriguez v. Eastern Air Lines, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"486540\"><a href=\"/opinion/486540/manuel-rodriguez-v-eastern-air-lines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">816</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 28 (1st Cir.1987).  Thus, whether Law 80's seniority provision, whatever its meaning, has been complied with is relevant only to the existence of \"good cause.\"   Law 80 does not, as McGaw argues, require it to use plantwide seniority, but at most merely says that if it does not, it may have to provide severance pay.  Cf. Rivera v. Security Nat'l Life Ins. Co., 106 D.P.R. 517, 527, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">50774</span></span> (1977).  \"[B]ut an employer willing to pay the price is free to discharge whomever he or she pleases.\"  Rodriguez, 816 F.2d at 28.   In short, \"[a]lthough Law 80 obviously is designed to assist those injured by arbitrary discharge practices, there is every indication from its language and other sources that the legislature intended to avoid direct interference with the employer's business operation,\" id., including its seniority and relocation policies.  McGaw's practices and statements indicate that, before the June 1994 layoff, it used criteria other than plantwide seniority and allowed senior affected employees to relocate.  It would be perverse indeed to allow it now to invoke a statute enacted for the protection of workers as a justification for its unlawful labor practices.  Second, the Guidelines indicate that \"if [a] dismissal of an employee turns out to be an illegal work practice, the applicable law is the Puerto Rico Labor Relations Act or the National Labor Relations Act, as the case may be.\"   Guidelines, 11.  Because McGaw's actions were unlawful under the latter, that is the controlling authority.  Finally, McGaw does not direct us to any case law interpreting Law 80 in a manner helpful to its argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that, because substantial evidence supports the Board's findings, its order should be enforced.  The Board's findings of various &#167; 8(a)(1) violations are summarily affirmed, given McGaw's failure to challenge them.  Further, we accept the Board's conclusion that substantial evidence indicates that the challenged layoffs were motivated primarily by anti-union animus and that McGaw's justifications for the particular layoffs at issue are insufficient.  Although McGaw may have had a legitimate reason for the LPC layoffs generally, it had no such reason for its changes in policy, which, together with the layoffs, adversely affected leading union activists and/or were taken to discourage others from supporting the Union.  Viewed in light of McGaw's anti-union animus, we have no trouble accepting that the layoffs constituted unlawfully discriminatory labor practices under the Act.  Given McGaw's contention that the LPC position no longer exists at its plant, we leave the issue of reinstatement to compliance proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Cf.
