Mark L. Wolf, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                  Selya, Boudin and Lynch,\r\n                      Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Asya Zimbovsky on brief pro se.\r\n\nAugust 3, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  Although this purports to be an appeal\r\nby plaintiff Asya Zimbovsky (who signed the complaint in the\r\ndistrict court), the notice of appeal and the brief were signed\r\nby Anina Rasten, who refers to herself as a co-plaintiff,\r\nalthough Rasten did not sign the complaint.  Further, although\r\nthe brief challenges the district court's order of December 7,\r\n1998, dismissing the complaint as frivolous, pursuant to 28\r\nU.S.C.  1915(e), the notice of appeal only references a\r\nDecember 29, 1998 order denying Rasten's motion to consolidate\r\nthe instant case with a separate matter filed by Rasten (that,\r\nit appears, was, itself, dismissed).  Moreover, while the\r\nnotice of appeal was timely from the one order that it did\r\nreference (the December 29 order), it was not timely from the\r\nonly order (the December 7 order) that the brief addresses.\r\n          In all events, there was neither error nor abuse of\r\ndiscretion in the district court's disposition of this case and\r\nits dismissal of the case and denial of the motion to\r\nconsolidate are affirmed.\r\n          The \"motion to change caption\" is denied.\r\n          The orders of the district court are affirmed.  Loc.\r\nR. 27.1.\n",
