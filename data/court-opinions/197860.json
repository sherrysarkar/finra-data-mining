Salvador E. Casellas, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                     Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n                 Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                   and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\nLydia Lizarribar-Masini on brief for appellant.\r\nGuillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Camille Velez-Rive and Nelson\r\nPerez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorneys, and Jose A.

Upon careful review of the briefs and record,\r\nwe perceive no merit in appellant's contentions.  \r\n    The district court did not abuse its discretion in\r\nrefusing appellant's request to withdraw his guilty plea.  The\r\ndistrict court weighed the proper factors and sensibly\r\nconcluded that appellant had not shown a fair and just reason\r\nto withdraw the plea.  That conclusion was well supported by\r\nappellant's answers during the regular plea colloquy, along\r\nwith the testimony of appellant's former attorney.  We cannot\r\nsay that the district court was required to adopt appellant's\r\nsubsequent, contradictory statements, which the district court\r\nfound to lack credibility.  See United States v. Marrero-\r\nRivera, 124 F.3d 342, 347-48 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\n    Further, the district court did not abuse its discretion\r\nin imposing a 2-level weapons enhancement under U.S.S.G. \r\n2D1.1(b)(1).  That enhancement was amply supported by the\r\ngovernment's version of the facts as agreed to by appellant,\r\nalong with other information about the reasonably foreseeable\r\nviolent nature of the conspiracy.  At sentencing, the district\r\ncourt was not required to allow appellant to attempt to impeach\r\na particular co-defendant's prior testimony on that point.  SeeFed. R. Crim. P. 32(c)(1).\r\n    Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
