TELL, ET AL.,\r\n\n                Plaintiffs, Appellants,\r\n\n                           v.\r\n\n             TRUSTEES OF DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,\r\n\n                  Defendant, Appellee.\r\n                                      \r\n\n      APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n           FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\r\n\n     [Hon. Paul J. Barbadoro, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                                      \r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                 Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n\n           Boudin and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n                                      \r\n\nW. Wright Danenbarger with whom Thomas W. Aylesworth and\r\nWiggin &amp; Nourie, P.A. were on brief for appellants.\r\nSean M. Gorman, Associate College Counsel, Dartmouth College,\r\nfor appellee. \r\n\n                     May 29, 1998\r\n\nBOUDIN, Circuit Judge.  This suit was brought in the\r\nfederal district court by William Tell and six other alumni of\r\nDartmouth College against the Trustees of Dartmouth College (the\r\ncorporate name of Dartmouth College).  Appellants claimed to\r\nrepresent Dartmouth's alumni as a class and challenged certain\r\nchanges in the arrangements for the election of trustees.  The\r\ndistrict court dismissed the case for lack of an indispensable\r\nparty, and this appeal followed. \r\nBecause the district court did not reach the merits, a\r\ncondensed version of the dispute will suffice.  Under an 1891\r\nunderstanding between Dartmouth and its alumni--which appellants\r\nclaim to have been a contract--the alumni effectively choose a\r\ncertain number of the trustees; the Dartmouth College Alumni\r\nAssociation, an unincorporated association comprising all Dartmouth\r\nalumni, conducts an election if there is any contest among\r\nnominees.  Prior to 1990, this process was used to fill both a\r\ntrustee's initial term and any subsequent terms.\r\nIn or about 1990, Dartmouth's Board of Trustees and the\r\nAlumni Association modified this arrangement in one respect:  it\r\nwas agreed that the Board of Trustees would have the power to\r\nreseat a trustee, originally chosen by the alumni, for an\r\nadditional term without obtaining the alumni's further approval. \r\nThe Alumni Association amended its constitution in September 1990\r\nto reflect this change.  Some of the alumni, of whom the appellants\r\nare examples, fiercely oppose the change as a surrender of the\r\nalumni's power.\r\nAppellants brought suit in state court, arguing that the\r\nchange in the Alumni Association's constitution was unlawful.  The\r\ncase was dismissed, and the appeal was declined by the New\r\nHampshire Supreme Court.  Appellants then brought the present suit\r\nagainst the Trustees in federal district court.  The suit alleges\r\nthat the Board of Trustees violated its fiduciary duties and its\r\ncontractual obligations under the 1891 agreement by modifying\r\nalumni rights as to the election of trustees.  There were\r\nadditional claims of  breach of fiduciary duty largely ancillary to\r\nthe main challenge.\r\nOn motion by the Board of Trustees, the district court \r\ndismissed the case, without prejudice, under Fed. R. Civ. P. 19. \r\nIt held that the Alumni Association was a necessary party under\r\nRule 19(a); that it could not be joined without undermining\r\ndiversity (the original basis for federal jurisdiction); and that\r\nwithout the Alumni Association, the action could not proceed \"in\r\nequity and good conscience . . . among the parties before [the\r\ncourt]\" and should therefore be dismissed, \"the absent person being\r\nthus regarded as indispensable.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(b).\r\nThere is apparently some difference among the circuits\r\nas to standard of review of decisions as to necessary joinder under\r\nRule 19(a).  Compare, e.g., Keweenaw Bay Indian Community v.\r\nMichigan, 11 F.3d 1341, 1346 (6th Cir. 1993), with Hellebust v.\r\nBrownback, 42 F.3d 1331, 1335 (10th Cir. 1994).  Normally, abstract\r\nissues of law are reviewed de novo, and judicial findings of fact \r\nfor clear error.  See Sacramona v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., 106\r\nF.3d 444, 446 (1st Cir. 1997).  The dispute, if any, is usually\r\nabout the extent to which the reviewing court should defer to the\r\ndistrict judge's application of a general standard (\"prejudice,\"\r\n\"equity\") to specific facts.  Strictly speaking, this is an issue\r\nof law, but one where the appeals courts often give the trial judge\r\nlatitude, but not always.  See, e.g., Ornelas v. United States,\r\n517 U.S. 690, 699-700 (1996).\r\nIf it mattered, this panel would be inclined to apply an\r\nabuse of discretion standard to such application-of-law decisions\r\nunder Rule 19(a).  See Travelers Indem. Co. v. Dingwell, 884 F.2d\r\n629, 635 (1st Cir. 1989) (applying this standard in the Rule 19(b)\r\ncontext).  However, the outcome would be the same even if we\r\ndecided the application issues afresh.  The district court has\r\nlucidly explained why the Alumni Association is an indispensable\r\nparty, and we affirm primarily on the basis of the district court's\r\ndecision, adding these further comments to address specific points\r\nraised by appellants.\r\nFirst, appellants say that the Alumni Association has\r\nbeen silent and therefore cannot be a person who \"claims an\r\ninterest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated\r\nthat the disposition of the action in the person's absence\" may\r\nhave the prejudicial effect described in Rule 19(a).  But \"claims\r\nan interest\" in this context means nothing more than appears to\r\nhave such an interest.  The situation would be different if the\r\nallegedly necessary party disclaimed an interest.  See Northrop\r\nCorp. v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 705 F.2d 1030, 1044 (9th Cir.),\r\ncert. denied, 464 U.S. 849 (1983).\r\nAppellants next say that the Alumni Association was not\r\na \"party\" to the 1891 understanding and is therefore unaffected by\r\na determination as to rights under the alleged contract.  The\r\ndistrict court said that the Alumni Association was a party to the\r\n1891 understanding, but we need not resolve the issue.  It is\r\nenough that the Alumni Association has long administered contested\r\nelections under the 1891 understanding, has changed its\r\nconstitution to conform to the 1990 modification, and would\r\nassuredly have to alter its conduct and its constitution if\r\nappellants showed that the modification was unlawful.\r\nAppellants next urge that even if the Alumni Association\r\ndoes have an interest in the case, its interest is adequately\r\nrepresented by the Board of Trustees.  If an absent party's\r\ninterests are the same as those of an existing party, and the\r\nexisting party will adequately protect those interests, this bears\r\non whether the absent party's interest will be impaired by its\r\nabsence from the litigation.  See Pujol v. Shearson/American\r\nExpress, Inc., 877 F.2d 132, 135 (1st Cir.  1989).  But without a\r\nperfect identify of interests, a court must be very cautious in\r\nconcluding that a litigant will serve as a proxy for an absent\r\nparty.  See 4 R.D. Freer, Moore's Federal Practice  19.03[3][f],\r\nat 19-56 to 19-57 (3d ed. 1998).\r\nIn this instance, the interests of the Alumni Association\r\nand the Board of Trustees were not shown to be precisely the same;\r\nindeed, an obvious potential exists for conflict about the binding\r\neffect of the 1891 understanding, even if the Alumni Association is\r\ncontent with the result in this case.  Further, appellants have\r\nexpressly claimed that the Board of Trustees has dominated and\r\nmanipulated the Alumni Association in order to enhance the Board of\r\nTrustees' power vis-a-vis the Alumni Association, making a claim of\r\nidentity of interests even less plausible.\r\nAppellants separately challenge the finding that the\r\nAlumni Association is \"indispensable\" or, in terms now used in the\r\nrule, \"whether in equity and good conscience the action should\r\nproceed among the parties before [the court] or should be dismissed\r\n. . . .\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(b).  Appellants say inter alia that\r\nthe district court failed to weigh \"whether the plaintiff will have\r\nan adequate remedy if the action is dismissed for nonjoinder.\"  Id. \r\nBut the district court explicitly took note of the fact that\r\nappellants had a state court forum--indeed, had already availed\r\nthemselves of it, at least as to certain of their claims--where\r\nlack of diversity is irrelevant.\r\nAfter the district court granted the motion to dismiss,\r\nappellants moved for reconsideration, urging that the indispensable\r\nparty problem could be remedied by resort to the supplemental\r\njurisdiction statute.  28 U.S.C.  1367.  The district court said\r\nthat the argument had been waived because it came too late but also\r\nsaid that the supplemental jurisdiction statute would not remedy\r\nthe problem.  We review the refusal of the district court to\r\nreconsider under an abuse of discretion standard.  See Aybar v.\r\nCrispin-Reyes, 118 F.3d 10, 13 (1st Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 118\r\nS. Ct. 857 (1998).\r\nIt is questionable whether the supplemental jurisdiction\r\nstatute would apply in this case, see 28 U.S.C.  1367(b) (limiting\r\nsupplemental jurisdiction in certain Rule 19 situations), but we\r\nneed not resolve the matter.  This alternative argument should have\r\nbeen proffered to the district court in response to the Board of\r\nTrustees' motion to  dismiss for a lack of an indispensable party. \r\nFailure to do so waived the argument, see Clauson v. Smith, 823\r\nF.2d 660, 666 (1st Cir. 1987), and the district court was not\r\nobliged to consider it on reconsideration.\r\nAffirmed.\r\n",

Prior to 1990, this process was used to fill both a trustee's initial term and any subsequent terms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In or about 1990, Dartmouth's Board of Trustees and the Alumni Association modified this arrangement in one respect:  it was agreed that the Board of Trustees would have the power to reseat a trustee, originally chosen by the alumni, for an additional term without obtaining the alumni's further approval.  The Alumni Association amended its constitution in September 1990 to reflect this change.  Some of the alumni, of whom the appellants are examples, fiercely oppose the change as a surrender of the alumni's power.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants brought suit in state court, arguing that the change in the Alumni Association's constitution was unlawful.  The case was dismissed, and the appeal was declined by the New Hampshire Supreme Court.  Appellants then brought the present suit against the Trustees in federal district court.  The suit alleges that the Board of Trustees violated its fiduciary duties and its contractual obligations under the 1891 agreement by modifying alumni rights as to the election of trustees.  There were additional claims of breach of fiduciary duty largely ancillary to the main challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On motion by the Board of Trustees, the district court dismissed the case, without prejudice, under Fed.R.Civ.P. 19.  It held that the Alumni Association was a necessary party under Rule 19(a);  that it could not be joined without undermining diversity (the original basis for federal jurisdiction);  and that without the Alumni Association, the action could not proceed \"in equity and good conscience ... among the parties before [the court]\" and should therefore be dismissed, \"the absent person being thus regarded as indispensable.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 19(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is apparently some difference among the circuits as to standard of review of decisions as to necessary joinder under Rule 19(a).  Compare, e.g., Keweenaw Bay Indian Community v. Michigan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"658797\"><a href=\"/opinion/658797/keweenaw-bay-indian-community-v-state-of-michigan-the-michigan-natural/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1341</span></a></span>, 1346 (6th Cir.1993), with Hellebust v. Brownback, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"684426\"><a href=\"/opinion/684426/lynn-hellebust-john-r-craft-kansas-natural-resource-council-and-common/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1331</span></a></span>, 1335 (10th Cir.1994).  Normally, abstract issues of law are reviewed de novo, and judicial findings of fact for clear error.  See Sacramona v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"735327\"><a href=\"/opinion/735327/46-fed-r-evid-serv-541-prodliabrep-cch-p-14872-robert-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">444</span></a></span>, 446 (1st Cir.1997).  The dispute, if any, is usually about the extent to which the reviewing court should defer to the district judge's application of a general standard (\"prejudice,\" \"equity\") to specific facts.  Strictly speaking, this is an issue of law, but one where the appeals courts often give the trial judge latitude,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> but not always.  See, e.g., Ornelas v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118030\"><a href=\"/opinion/118030/ornelas-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">690</span></a></span>, 699-700, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118030\"><a href=\"/opinion/118030/ornelas-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1657</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118030\"><a href=\"/opinion/118030/ornelas-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">911</span></a></span> (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If it mattered, this panel would be inclined to apply an abuse of discretion standard to such application-of-law decisions under Rule 19(a).  See Travelers Indem. Co. v. Dingwell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"528782\"><a href=\"/opinion/528782/the-travelers-indemnity-company-v-richard-a-dingwell-dba-mckin/\"><span class=\"volume\">884</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">629</span></a></span>, 635 (1st Cir.1989) (applying this standard in the Rule 19(b) context).  However, the outcome would be the same even if we decided the application issues afresh.  The district court has lucidly explained why the Alumni Association is an indispensable party, and we affirm primarily on the basis of the district court's decision, adding these further comments to address specific points raised by appellants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, appellants say that the Alumni Association has been silent and therefore cannot be a person who \"claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in the person's absence\" may have the prejudicial effect described in Rule 19(a).  But \"claims an interest\" in this context means nothing more than appears to have such an interest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The situation would be different if the allegedly necessary party disclaimed an interest.  See Northrop Corp. v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">705</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1030</span></span>, 1044 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">849</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></span> (1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants next say that the Alumni Association was not a \"party\" to the 1891 understanding and is therefore unaffected by a determination as to rights under the alleged contract.  The district court said that the Alumni Association was a party to the 1891 understanding, but we need not resolve the issue.  It is enough that the Alumni Association has long administered contested elections under the 1891 understanding, has changed its constitution to conform to the 1990 modification, and would assuredly have to alter its conduct and its constitution if appellants showed that the modification was unlawful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants next urge that even if the Alumni Association does have an interest in the case, its interest is adequately represented by the Board of Trustees.  If an absent party's interests are the same as those of an existing party, and the existing party will adequately protect those interests, this bears on whether the absent party's interest will be impaired by its absence from the litigation.  See Pujol v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524957\"><a href=\"/opinion/524957/francisco-pujol-v-shearsonamerican-express-inc-appeal-of-ana-bonelli/\"><span class=\"volume\">877</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">132</span></a></span>, 135 (1st Cir.1989).  But without a perfect identify of interests, a court must be very cautious in concluding that a litigant will serve as a proxy for an absent party.  See 4 R.D. Freer, Moore's Federal Practice &#167; 19.03[f], at 19-56 to 19-57 (3d ed.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the interests of the Alumni Association and the Board of Trustees were not shown to be precisely the same;  indeed, an obvious potential exists for conflict about the binding effect of the 1891 understanding, even if the Alumni Association is content with the result in this case.  Further, appellants have expressly claimed that the Board of Trustees has dominated and manipulated the Alumni Association in order to enhance the Board of Trustees' power vis-a-vis the Alumni Association, making a claim of identity of interests even less plausible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants separately challenge the finding that the Alumni Association is \"indispensable\" or, in terms now used in the rule, \"whether in equity and good conscience the action should proceed among the parties before [the court] or should be dismissed ....\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 19(b).  Appellants say inter alia that the district court failed to weigh \"whether the plaintiff will have an adequate remedy if the action is dismissed for nonjoinder.\"  Id. But the district court explicitly took note of the fact that appellants had a state court forum--indeed, had already availed themselves of it, at least as to certain of their claims--where lack of diversity is irrelevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the district court granted the motion to dismiss, appellants moved for reconsideration, urging that the indispensable party problem could be remedied by resort to the supplemental jurisdiction statute.  28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367.  The district court said that the argument had been waived because it came too late but also said that the supplemental jurisdiction statute would not remedy the problem.  We review the refusal of the district court to reconsider under an abuse of discretion standard.  See Aybar v. Crispin-Reyes, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197430\"><a href=\"/opinion/197430/aybar-v-crispin-reyes/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 13 (1st Cir.1997), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">857</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">757</span></span> (1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is questionable whether the supplemental jurisdiction statute would apply in this case, see 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367(b) (limiting supplemental jurisdiction in certain Rule 19 situations), but we need not resolve the matter.  This alternative argument should have been proffered to the district court in response to the Board of Trustees' motion to dismiss for a lack of an indispensable party.  Failure to do so waived the argument, see Clauson v. Smith, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"491456\"><a href=\"/opinion/491456/charles-clauson-v-robert-d-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">823</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">660</span></a></span>, 666 (1st Cir.1987), and the district court was not obliged to consider it on reconsideration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The reason is apparent:  the application issue, turning on specific facts, will not recur in identical form and the district judge is closer to the facts, may actually have heard evidence, and has a comparative advantage over a reviewing court.

Comm., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"546213\"><a href=\"/opinion/546213/roland-m-and-miriam-m-v-the-concord-school-committee/\"><span class=\"volume\">910</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">983</span></a></span>, 990 (1st Cir.1990), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">912</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
