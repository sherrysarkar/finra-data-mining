Powers and DeSisto Law Offices on  brief\r                                                                    \r\nfor appellees.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                       October 24, 1997\r\n                                         \r\r\n\n     Per Curiam.  Upon review  of the parties' briefs and the\r                           \r\n\nrecord  on appeal,  we conclude  that there  was no  abuse of\r\n\ndiscretion in the two evidentiary rulings of which plaintiff-\r\n\nappellant complains.\r\n\n     In  the  district court  action,  plaintiff accused  two\r\n\nWoonsocket, Rhode Island police  officers of using  excessive\r\n\nforce  and  of  assault  and  battery  during the  course  of\r\n\nplaintiff's arrest following an altercation with the officers\r\n\nduring a stop for traffic violations.  The jury found for the\r\n\ndefendants.\r\n\n     In  this appeal,  plaintiff  challenges two  evidentiary\r\n\nrulings  of the trial  court.  Determinations  concerning the\r\n\nadmissibility as well  as the exclusion of  evidence are left\r\n\nto the  sound discretion of  the trial court, and  this court\r\n\nwill   reverse  only  if   the  district  court   abused  its\r\n\ndiscretion.  See Knowlton v.  Deseret Medical Inc., 930  F.2d\r                                                              \r\n\n116, 124 (1st Cir. 1991).\r\n\n     First, plaintiff challenges  the trial court's  decision\r\n\nnot to admit into the  record a state court decision vacating\r\n\nhis  convictions for the traffic violations that prompted the\r\n\ninitial stop.  The district court was within its  discretion,\r\n\nbecause the issue of whether plaintiff actually committed the\r\n\ntraffic violations for which he was stopped was  not relevant\r\n\nto whether the  police officers used  excessive force in  the\r\n\ncourse  of  his  arrest.   Plaintiff  did  not  challenge the\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nlegality  of  the  arrest  per  se,  and  in  any  event  the\r\n\nsubsequent decision to vacate his convictions for the traffic\r\n\nviolations is only marginally relevant, if at all, to whether\r\n\nthe police officers  had a sufficient basis  for stopping him\r\n\nat the time they did.\r\n\n     Second, plaintiff challenges the  trial court's decision\r\n\nto admit his \"mug shot\"  on grounds that it was substantially\r\n\nmore prejudicial than probative.  See Fed. R. Evid. 403.  The\r                                                 \r\n\ntrial court was within its discretion, as the lack of visible\r\n\ninjuries on plaintiff's  neck in the photograph  was relevant\r\n\nin  that  it  tended  to undermine  his  testimony  that  the\r\n\ndefendants had  choked him during the arrest.   Moreover, the\r\n\nrisk  of prejudice  from  the photograph  was  minimal.   The\r\n\nphotographs were  of the  very arrest that  gave rise  to the\r\n\nlawsuit, and  thus -- unlike  mug shots for prior  arrests --\r\n\nhad no tendency  to imply past criminal conduct.   Cf. United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates  v.
