Plaintiff-Appellant\r\n\nLeo Vartanian alleges that his former employer, Monsanto Chemical\r\n\nCompany (\"Monsanto\"), misled him by failing to respond adequately\r\n\nto  his  inquiries  about  a  severance  package  that  was under\r\n\ninternal corporate consideration when he retired from the company\r\n\non May  1, 1991.   A benefits package  for which  Vartanian would\r\n\nhave  otherwise been eligible was  approved by the Monsanto Board\r\n\nof Directors on June 28, 1991.\r\n\n          Vartanian  filed a  complaint against Monsanto  in 1992\r\n\nalleging two counts of breach  of fiduciary duty under ERISA, one\r\n\ncount of unlawful discrimination in  violation of   510 of ERISA,\r\n\nand one  count of  common law  negligent misrepresentation.   The\r\n\ndistrict court, Ponsor, J.,1 granted Monsanto's motion to dismiss\r\n\nthe  action  on  the  grounds  that,  having  taken  a  lump  sum\r\n\ndistribution of all the vested benefits to which he was entitled,\r\n\nVartanian could not qualify as a \"plan participant\" with standing\r\n\nto assert  ERISA violations.   Vartanian v. Monsanto Co.,  822 F.\r                                                                  \r\n\nSupp.  36, 41  (D. Mass.  1993).   This Court  reversed, holding,\r\n\ninter alia, that because Vartanian was  a plan member at the time\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   Judge Ponsor  was at the  time a Magistrate  Judge.

Vartanian v. Monsanto  Co., 14 F.3d 697,  703 (1st\r                                                   \r\n\nCir. 1994)(Vartanian I).\r                              \r\n\n          On remand Judge Ponsor dismissed Vartanian's claim that\r\n\nMonsanto had  breached an ERISA  duty by failing to  disclose its\r\n\nprospective plans to reduce staffing, but permitted the claims of\r\n\nmisrepresentation  about the  possibility of an  early retirement\r\n\nincentive plan  to proceed.   Vartanian v.  Monsanto Co.,  880 F.\r                                                                  \r\n\nSupp. 63, 70-71  (D. Mass. 1995).  After  discovery, Judge Ponsor\r\n\ngranted  Monsanto's motion  for  summary  judgment, holding  that\r\n\nbecause  no enhanced severance  package that would  have affected\r\n\nVartanian  was under  \"serious  consideration\"  at  the  time  he\r\n\nretired,   no  actionable   misrepresentation   had  been   made.\r\n\nVartanian v.  Monsanto Co., 956 F. Supp.  61, 66 (D. Mass. 1997).\r                                    \r\n\nWe affirm.\r\n\n                                I.\r                                          I\r\n\n          Our review of a motion for summary judgment is de novo.\r\n\nAssociated Fisheries of Maine, Inc.  v.

Sept.  16, 1997).\r\n\nSummary   judgment   is   appropriate   where   \"the   pleadings,\r\n\ndepositions,  answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\r\n\ntogether  with the  affidavits, if  any,  show that  there is  no\r\n\ngenuine issue as to any  material fact and that the  moving party\r\n\nis entitled to a  judgment as a matter of law.\"   Fed. R. Civ. P.\r\n\n56(c).   Inferences are drawn in the  light most favorable to the\r\n\nnonmoving party.   Reich v. John Alden Life Ins. Co., 126 F.3d 1,\r                                                              \r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n6 (1st Cir.  1997).  The nonmovant  may not, of course,  defeat a\r\n\nmotion  for summary  judgment  on conjecture  alone.   \"The  mere\r\n\nexistence   of  a  scintilla  of   evidence  in  support  of  the\r\n\nplaintiff's position will be insufficient; there must be evidence\r\n\non  which the  jury  could reasonably  find  for the  plaintiff.\"\r\n\nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252 (1986).\r                                         \r\n\n          The  following undisputed material facts are drawn from\r\n\nthe  parties'  Joint  Statement of  Stipulated  Facts, Defendant-\r\n\nAppellee Monsanto's Statement of Undisputed Facts, and Plaintiff-\r\n\nAppellant  Vartanian's  Response   to  Defendant's  Statement  of\r\n\nUndisputed  Facts.  After thirty-six years at Monsanto, Vartanian\r\n\nin December 1989 announced his  intention to retire on January 1,\r\n\n1991 (later amended to May 1, 1991).  Vartanian was then employed\r\n\nat Monsanto's plastics facility at Indian Orchard, Massachusetts.\r\n\nVartanian elected to take a lump sum distribution of his Salaried\r\n\nEmployee's  Pension Plan benefits.  During past restructurings of\r\n\nits business,  Monsanto had offered early  retirement incentives,\r\n\nsometimes  on  a  company-wide basis  and  sometimes  to specific\r\n\ngroups of employees.\r\n\n          During 1990  and 1991, Monsanto's  sales stagnated  and\r\n\nnet  income  shrunk.   Rumors  began  circulating  among Monsanto\r\n\nemployees  that the  company was  pondering  an early  retirement\r\n\nprogram as  a cost-cutting  device.   These  intensified when  in\r\n\nOctober  of  1990  Monsanto   Agricultural  Company  (a  separate\r\n\nMonsanto operating unit)  offered a severance program to  some of\r\n\nits employees  as part  of a reorganization  plan.  In  the first\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nquarter of 1991, Robert Potter,  the president of Monsanto, began\r\n\ndiscussing  with   his  senior  managers  various   proposals  to\r\n\nstreamline operations at  Monsanto Chemical.  These  included the\r\n\nclosing  of several plants,  but not the  Indian Orchard facility\r\n\nwhere Vartanian worked.   No plans were  drawn up to implement  a\r\n\nseverance  package,2  although  Frank  Reining, Monsanto's  vice-\r\n\npresident of  finance,  prepared  an  estimate  of  the  cost  of\r\n\noffering severance benefits to some 400 hypothetical employees.\r\n\n          In March of  1991, Vartanian asked Charles  Eggert, his\r\n\nimmediate supervisor,  if the  rumors about  an early  retirement\r\n\nplan   were  true.    After  investigating,  Eggert  reported  to\r\n\nVartanian  that  Monsanto  was  not  contemplating any  severance\r\n\nprogram  for which  he would  be eligible.   On  March 25,  1991,\r\n\nVartanian  and his wife  executed an Affidavit,  General Release,\r\n\nand  Agreement in  anticipation of  the release  of the  lump sum\r\n\nbenefits.\r\n\n          During  the week  of April  15-21,  1991, after  gossip\r\n\nabout a possible severance plan revived, Vartanian contacted both\r\n\nEggert  and Lori Heffelfinger,  the personnel  representative for\r\n\nhis employee group.  Eggert and Heffelfinger told  Vartanian that\r\n\nthey  had  been  unable  to  confirm  the  rumors,  and  did  not\r\n\npersonally believe that any early  retirement package was in  the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2   Vartanian  asserts  that  any  downsizing  discussions  would\r\ninferentially  have involved  the  issue  of  severance  benefits\r\nbecause of Monsanto's record of  offering such incentives as part\r\nof past restructuring.  \r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nworks.   Vartanian does  not dispute  the truthfulness  of either\r\n\nstatement.\r\n\n           Between  April  21  and  May  1,  1991,  the  Monsanto\r\n\nManagement  Board met six times, eventually deciding to recommend\r\n\nto  the  Board  of Directors  the  closure  of  six  plants.   No\r\n\npresentation concerning  early retirement incentives  was made at\r\n\nany of these  meetings, and no document analyzing  or proposing a\r\n\nseverance program was prepared.  Three alternate plans were drawn\r\n\nup for restructuring Monsanto's multiple product lines.  None  of\r\n\nthe   product  lines   in  Vartanian's   Plastics  Division   was\r\n\nrecommended  for discontinuance.   Vartanian  retired  on May  1,\r\n\n1991.\r\n\n          On May 7, 1991, Potter met with  the Monsanto Executive\r\n\nManagement Committee, which endorsed in principle his proposal to\r\n\nrestructure  the company.    On  May 16,  1991,  John Manns,  the\r\n\ndirector of employee  benefits, was asked to develop  a severance\r\n\nprogram  for   potentially  impacted  employees.     Manns  asked\r\n\nMonsanto's actuaries, Towers, Perrin, Forster &amp; Crosby (\"TPF&amp;C\"),\r\n\nto gather the necessary data.  On May 24, 1991, Manns  gave TPF&amp;C\r\n\nan  outline of  his proposal.   On May  28, 1991, Manns  met with\r\n\nRobert  Abercrombie, the  corporate benefits director,  and Barry\r\n\nBlitstein,  a corporate  vice president,  to  discuss a  concrete\r\n\nseverance  plan.    It  was at  this  meeting  that  the idea  of\r\n\nextending an offer of early retirement  to all Monsanto employees\r\n\nwas first raised.\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n          Coincidentally,  on  May  28, 1991,  a  St. Louis-based\r\n\nPlastics Division employee  who had decided to retire  on June 1,\r\n\n1991, was assured  by letter that  he would receive the  value of\r\n\nany increase in benefits if an early retirement program for which\r\n\nhe would  otherwise have been  eligible was adopted  within three\r\n\nmonths  of his retirement  date.  On  June 12, 1991,  another St.\r\n\nLouis-based Plastics Division  employee who planned to  retire on\r\n\nJuly  1, 1991,  was  given  a similar  written  assurance.   Both\r\n\nemployees  were  eventually  paid the  additional  benefits  from\r\n\nMonsanto's corporate treasury.\r\n\n          On  June  3,  1991,  Monsanto's  Executive   Management\r\n\nCommittee  endorsed the idea  of a company-wide  early retirement\r\n\nprogram,  and authorized further development work on the project.\r\n\nPotter  told his  division managers  that they  were to  make the\r\n\nfinal decision whether to  offer the program to  their respective\r\n\nemployees.   John  Tuley, the  manager  of Vartanian's  division,\r\n\ndecided not to participate.  Tuley's decision was reversed by his\r\n\nsuccessor,  Arthur  Fitzgerald,   in  mid-June  of  1991.     The\r\n\nretirement plan was  finalized on June 27, 1991,  and approved by\r\n\nMonsanto's Board  of Directors on  June 28, 1991.   Had Vartanian\r\n\nbeen  eligible  to   participate,  he  would  have   received  an\r\n\nadditional $174,700 in pension benefits.3\r\n\n                               II.\r                                         II.\r\n\n          Although  this  Court,  in  Vartanian  I,  stated  that\r                                                         \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3   It is  unclear whether Vartanian  would have qualified  for a\r\nlump sum distribution had he chosen the early retirement option.\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nMonsanto had \"a fiduciary duty not to mislead Vartanian as to the\r\n\nprospective adoption of  a plan under serious  consideration,\" 14\r\n\nF.3d at 702,  it had no  occasion to reach  the question of  what\r\n\nexactly constitutes \"serious consideration.\"   The district court\r\n\non remand adopted  the standard espoused by the  Third Circuit in\r\n\nFischer  v.  Philadelphia  Elec.  Co.,  96  F.3d  1533  (3d  Cir.\r                                               \r\n\n1996)(Fischer II),  cert. denied,  117 S.

Because  an early disclosure requirement  would \"increase\r\n\nthe likelihood  of  confusion on  the part  of the  beneficiaries\r\n\n[and] .  . . management would be unduly burdened by the continued\r\n\nuncertainty of  what to  disclose and when  to disclose  it,\" the\r\n\ncourt  required  the  existence  of  a  \"particular  plan  for  a\r\n\nparticular purpose.\"   Id.

A primary\r\n\nconcern of  Congress  in enacting  ERISA  was not  to  discourage\r\n\nemployers from  offering employee  pensions.   \"We know  that new\r\n\npension plans  will not be  adopted and that existing  plans will\r\n\nnot  be expanded  and liberalized  if the  costs are  made overly\r\n\nburdensome, particularly for employers who generally foot most of\r\n\nthe bill.\"   120  Cong.

If it is  clear from the\r\n\ntotality of the facts that a severance package is, in fact, under\r\n\nserious consideration, we  do not think that  clever manipulation\r\n\nof  the Fischer  II test  should relieve  a wrongdoer  from ERISA\r                         \r\n\nliability.

Thus,  in the  typical case,\r\n\nwhere there is no evidence  of a deliberate attempt to circumvent\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\nERISA, a  straightforward application of  the Fischer II  test is\r                                                               \r\n\nall that is required.\r\n\n          We thus  conclude, modifying  Fischer II,  that serious\r                                                         \r\n\nconsideration  of a  change in  plan benefits  exists when  (1) a\r\n\nspecific proposal which would affect  a person in the position of\r\n\nthe   plaintiff  (2)   is  being   discussed   for  purposes   of\r\n\nimplementation (3)  by senior  management with  the authority  to\r\n\nimplement that change.\r\n\n                                B.\r                                          B.\r\n\n          Turning to the facts of this  case, it is clear that no\r\n\nearly  retirement  plan  affecting  Vartanian was  under  serious\r\n\nconsideration  by Monsanto's senior management on April 21, 1991,\r\n\nthe day  when  Vartanian began  his final  inquiries.   President\r\n\nPotter had  begun conferring with  his senior managers  about the\r\n\npossibility of  a corporate restructuring.   He had asked  for an\r\n\nestimate of the  cost that Monsanto would incur  if 400 employees\r\n\nwere laid off.  But  these corporate ruminations, precipitated by\r\n\nthe   downturn  in  Monsanto's  business,  did  not  trigger  any\r\n\ncontemporaneous duty of disclosure.\r\n\n          First,   there   was   no   specific   proposal   under\r\n\nconsideration.  At most, there  was a suggestion that an enhanced\r\n\nseverance package  might be  one way to  deal with  the company's\r\n\nfiscal woes.  Second,  although Potter was certainly among  those\r\n\nindividuals qualifying  as \"senior management with  the authority\r\n\nto implement the  change,\" there is no evidence  that anything of\r\n\nsubstance was, in fact, being  discussed for implementation.  The\r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\nideas that were  floating among top management were  only that --\r\n\nideas.  As a result, the answers that Vartanian received in March\r\n\nand April of 1991, that no material changes affecting his benefit\r\n\nplan were being considered, were not misrepresentations.\r\n\n          Potter received an endorsement  on May 7, 1991, of  his\r\n\nrestructuring  proposal  from the  Monsanto  Executive Management\r\n\nCommittee.  Nine days later,  he ordered the director of employee\r\n\nbenefits   to  begin  planning  a  severance  program  for  those\r\n\nemployees who  would be displaced.   Not until  the May 28,  1991\r\n\nmeeting of  senior managers was  it proposed to extend  the early\r\n\nretirement plan to all Monsanto employees.  This is  the point at\r\n\nwhich \"the three [factors] interact[ed] and coalesce[d] to form a\r\n\ncomposite picture  of serious  consideration,\" giving  rise to  a\r\n\nfiduciary duty of disclosure.

Vartanian's assertion, however,  depends upon a\r\nfinding of a material misrepresentation.\r\n\n   He also  suggests that,  because a  determination of  \"serious\r\nconsideration\" is  fact-specific, it  can only  be resolved by  a\r\njury.  At  the summary judgment stage, however,  only disputes of\r\nmaterial fact need be resolved by a fact-finder.  Fed. R. Civ.

While it may  be small  comfort, Vartanian's\r\n\nperseverance  has resulted in  the clarification of  an important\r\n\narea of ERISA law in this circuit.\r\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district\r\n\ncourt is affirmed.

A benefits package  for which  Vartanian would\r\n\nhave  otherwise been eligible was  approved by the Monsanto Board\r\n\nof Directors on June 28, 1991.\r\n\n          Vartanian  filed a  complaint against Monsanto  in 1992\r\n\nalleging two counts of breach  of fiduciary duty under ERISA, one\r\n\ncount of unlawful discrimination in  violation of   510 of ERISA,\r\n\nand one  count of  common law  negligent misrepresentation.   The\r\n\ndistrict court, Ponsor, J.,1 granted Monsanto's motion to dismiss\r\n\nthe  action  on  the  grounds  that,  having  taken  a  lump  sum\r\n\ndistribution of all the vested benefits to which he was entitled,\r\n\nVartanian could not qualify as a \"plan participant\" with standing\r\n\nto assert  ERISA violations.

After thirty-six years at Monsanto, Vartanian\r\n\nin December 1989 announced his  intention to retire on January 1,\r\n\n1991 (later amended to May 1, 1991).  Vartanian was then employed\r\n\nat Monsanto's plastics facility at Indian Orchard, Massachusetts.\r\n\nVartanian elected to take a lump sum distribution of his Salaried\r\n\nEmployee's  Pension Plan benefits.  During past restructurings of\r\n\nits business,  Monsanto had offered early  retirement incentives,\r\n\nsometimes  on  a  company-wide basis  and  sometimes  to specific\r\n\ngroups of employees.\r\n\n          During 1990  and 1991, Monsanto's  sales stagnated  and\r\n\nnet  income  shrunk.   Rumors  began  circulating  among Monsanto\r\n\nemployees  that the  company was  pondering  an early  retirement\r\n\nprogram as  a cost-cutting  device.   These  intensified when  in\r\n\nOctober  of  1990  Monsanto   Agricultural  Company  (a  separate\r\n\nMonsanto operating unit)  offered a severance program to  some of\r\n\nits employees  as part  of a reorganization  plan.  In  the first\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nquarter of 1991, Robert Potter,  the president of Monsanto, began\r\n\ndiscussing  with   his  senior  managers  various   proposals  to\r\n\nstreamline operations at  Monsanto Chemical.  These  included the\r\n\nclosing  of several plants,  but not the  Indian Orchard facility\r\n\nwhere Vartanian worked.   No plans were  drawn up to implement  a\r\n\nseverance  package,2  although  Frank  Reining, Monsanto's  vice-\r\n\npresident of  finance,  prepared  an  estimate  of  the  cost  of\r\n\noffering severance benefits to some 400 hypothetical employees.\r\n\n          In March of  1991, Vartanian asked Charles  Eggert, his\r\n\nimmediate supervisor,  if the  rumors about  an early  retirement\r\n\nplan   were  true.    After  investigating,  Eggert  reported  to\r\n\nVartanian  that  Monsanto  was  not  contemplating any  severance\r\n\nprogram  for which  he would  be eligible.   On  March 25,  1991,\r\n\nVartanian  and his wife  executed an Affidavit,  General Release,\r\n\nand  Agreement in  anticipation of  the release  of the  lump sum\r\n\nbenefits.\r\n\n          During  the week  of April  15-21,  1991, after  gossip\r\n\nabout a possible severance plan revived, Vartanian contacted both\r\n\nEggert  and Lori Heffelfinger,  the personnel  representative for\r\n\nhis employee group.  Eggert and Heffelfinger told  Vartanian that\r\n\nthey  had  been  unable  to  confirm  the  rumors,  and  did  not\r\n\npersonally believe that any early  retirement package was in  the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2   Vartanian  asserts  that  any  downsizing  discussions  would\r\ninferentially  have involved  the  issue  of  severance  benefits\r\nbecause of Monsanto's record of  offering such incentives as part\r\nof past restructuring.  \r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nworks.   Vartanian does  not dispute  the truthfulness  of either\r\n\nstatement.\r\n\n           Between  April  21  and  May  1,  1991,  the  Monsanto\r\n\nManagement  Board met six times, eventually deciding to recommend\r\n\nto  the  Board  of Directors  the  closure  of  six  plants.   No\r\n\npresentation concerning  early retirement incentives  was made at\r\n\nany of these  meetings, and no document analyzing  or proposing a\r\n\nseverance program was prepared.  Three alternate plans were drawn\r\n\nup for restructuring Monsanto's multiple product lines.  None  of\r\n\nthe   product  lines   in  Vartanian's   Plastics  Division   was\r\n\nrecommended  for discontinuance.   Vartanian  retired  on May  1,\r\n\n1991.\r\n\n          On May 7, 1991, Potter met with  the Monsanto Executive\r\n\nManagement Committee, which endorsed in principle his proposal to\r\n\nrestructure  the company.    On  May 16,  1991,  John Manns,  the\r\n\ndirector of employee  benefits, was asked to develop  a severance\r\n\nprogram  for   potentially  impacted  employees.     Manns  asked\r\n\nMonsanto's actuaries, Towers, Perrin, Forster &amp; Crosby (\"TPF&amp;C\"),\r\n\nto gather the necessary data.  On May 24, 1991, Manns  gave TPF&amp;C\r\n\nan  outline of  his proposal.   On May  28, 1991, Manns  met with\r\n\nRobert  Abercrombie, the  corporate benefits director,  and Barry\r\n\nBlitstein,  a corporate  vice president,  to  discuss a  concrete\r\n\nseverance  plan.    It  was at  this  meeting  that  the idea  of\r\n\nextending an offer of early retirement  to all Monsanto employees\r\n\nwas first raised.\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n          Coincidentally,  on  May  28, 1991,  a  St. Louis-based\r\n\nPlastics Division employee  who had decided to retire  on June 1,\r\n\n1991, was assured  by letter that  he would receive the  value of\r\n\nany increase in benefits if an early retirement program for which\r\n\nhe would  otherwise have been  eligible was adopted  within three\r\n\nmonths  of his retirement  date.  On  June 12, 1991,  another St.\r\n\nLouis-based Plastics Division  employee who planned to  retire on\r\n\nJuly  1, 1991,  was  given  a similar  written  assurance.   Both\r\n\nemployees  were  eventually  paid the  additional  benefits  from\r\n\nMonsanto's corporate treasury.\r\n\n          On  June  3,  1991,  Monsanto's  Executive   Management\r\n\nCommittee  endorsed the idea  of a company-wide  early retirement\r\n\nprogram,  and authorized further development work on the project.\r\n\nPotter  told his  division managers  that they  were to  make the\r\n\nfinal decision whether to  offer the program to  their respective\r\n\nemployees.   John  Tuley, the  manager  of Vartanian's  division,\r\n\ndecided not to participate.  Tuley's decision was reversed by his\r\n\nsuccessor,  Arthur  Fitzgerald,   in  mid-June  of  1991.     The\r\n\nretirement plan was  finalized on June 27, 1991,  and approved by\r\n\nMonsanto's Board  of Directors on  June 28, 1991.   Had Vartanian\r\n\nbeen  eligible  to   participate,  he  would  have   received  an\r\n\nadditional $174,700 in pension benefits.3\r\n\n                               II.\r                                         II.\r\n\n          Although  this  Court,  in  Vartanian  I,  stated  that\r                                                         \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3   It is  unclear whether Vartanian  would have qualified  for a\r\nlump sum distribution had he chosen the early retirement option.\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nMonsanto had \"a fiduciary duty not to mislead Vartanian as to the\r\n\nprospective adoption of  a plan under serious  consideration,\" 14\r\n\nF.3d at 702,  it had no  occasion to reach  the question of  what\r\n\nexactly constitutes \"serious consideration.\"   The district court\r\n\non remand adopted  the standard espoused by the  Third Circuit in\r\n\nFischer  v.

A primary\r\n\nconcern of  Congress  in enacting  ERISA  was not  to  discourage\r\n\nemployers from  offering employee  pensions.   \"We know  that new\r\n\npension plans  will not be  adopted and that existing  plans will\r\n\nnot  be expanded  and liberalized  if the  costs are  made overly\r\n\nburdensome, particularly for employers who generally foot most of\r\n\nthe bill.\"   120  Cong.

If it is  clear from the\r\n\ntotality of the facts that a severance package is, in fact, under\r\n\nserious consideration, we  do not think that  clever manipulation\r\n\nof  the Fischer  II test  should relieve  a wrongdoer  from ERISA\r                         \r\n\nliability.  The ultimate question is whether \"a composite picture\r\n\nof serious consideration\" has developed.

Thus,  in the  typical case,\r\n\nwhere there is no evidence  of a deliberate attempt to circumvent\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\nERISA, a  straightforward application of  the Fischer II  test is\r                                                               \r\n\nall that is required.\r\n\n          We thus  conclude, modifying  Fischer II,  that serious\r                                                         \r\n\nconsideration  of a  change in  plan benefits  exists when  (1) a\r\n\nspecific proposal which would affect  a person in the position of\r\n\nthe   plaintiff  (2)   is  being   discussed   for  purposes   of\r\n\nimplementation (3)  by senior  management with  the authority  to\r\n\nimplement that change.\r\n\n                                B.\r                                          B.\r\n\n          Turning to the facts of this  case, it is clear that no\r\n\nearly  retirement  plan  affecting  Vartanian was  under  serious\r\n\nconsideration  by Monsanto's senior management on April 21, 1991,\r\n\nthe day  when  Vartanian began  his final  inquiries.   President\r\n\nPotter had  begun conferring with  his senior managers  about the\r\n\npossibility of  a corporate restructuring.   He had asked  for an\r\n\nestimate of the  cost that Monsanto would incur  if 400 employees\r\n\nwere laid off.  But  these corporate ruminations, precipitated by\r\n\nthe   downturn  in  Monsanto's  business,  did  not  trigger  any\r\n\ncontemporaneous duty of disclosure.\r\n\n          First,   there   was   no   specific   proposal   under\r\n\nconsideration.  At most, there  was a suggestion that an enhanced\r\n\nseverance package  might be  one way to  deal with  the company's\r\n\nfiscal woes.  Second,  although Potter was certainly among  those\r\n\nindividuals qualifying  as \"senior management with  the authority\r\n\nto implement the  change,\" there is no evidence  that anything of\r\n\nsubstance was, in fact, being  discussed for implementation.  The\r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\nideas that were  floating among top management were  only that --\r\n\nideas.  As a result, the answers that Vartanian received in March\r\n\nand April of 1991, that no material changes affecting his benefit\r\n\nplan were being considered, were not misrepresentations.\r\n\n          Potter received an endorsement  on May 7, 1991, of  his\r\n\nrestructuring  proposal  from the  Monsanto  Executive Management\r\n\nCommittee.  Nine days later,  he ordered the director of employee\r\n\nbenefits   to  begin  planning  a  severance  program  for  those\r\n\nemployees who  would be displaced.   Not until  the May 28,  1991\r\n\nmeeting of  senior managers was  it proposed to extend  the early\r\n\nretirement plan to all Monsanto employees.  This is  the point at\r\n\nwhich \"the three [factors] interact[ed] and coalesce[d] to form a\r\n\ncomposite picture  of serious  consideration,\" giving  rise to  a\r\n\nfiduciary duty of disclosure.  Fischer II, 96 F.3d at 1539.7\r                                                \r\n\n                            Conclusion\r                                      Conclusion\r\n\n          Vartanian's additional  arguments on  appeal are  of no\r\n\nmerit.8  While  we recognize that the outcome  of this protracted\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n7  It  appears that Monsanto went further than  we might require.\r\nAfter serious consideration  had occurred, two employees  who had\r\nannounced  their  intention  to retire  without  inquiring  about\r\npossible  changes in  their  retirement plans  were retroactively\r\npaid the value of the benefits enhancement.\r\n\n8   Vartanian  asserts error  in  the district  court's grant  of\r\nsummary judgment  to Monsanto on  his claim under  510  of ERISA,\r\nwhich makes it unlawful for  any person to discriminate against a\r\nplan participant for purposes of interfering with any right under\r\na benefit plan.   Vartanian's assertion, however,  depends upon a\r\nfinding of a material misrepresentation.\r\n\n   He also  suggests that,  because a  determination of  \"serious\r\nconsideration\" is  fact-specific, it  can only  be resolved by  a\r\njury.  At  the summary judgment stage, however,  only disputes of\r\nmaterial fact need be resolved by a fact-finder.  Fed. R. Civ.
