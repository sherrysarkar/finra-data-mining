See Anders  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nState  of California, 386 U.S. 738, 744 (1967); 1st Cir. Loc.\r                                \r\n\nR. 46.4(a)(4).  Defendant has not filed a separate brief, and\r\n\nthe  government  has  moved  for summary  dismissal  of  this\r\n\nappeal.   As  required by  Anders, we  have conducted  a full\r                                             \r\n\nexamination of  the proceedings.  Based  on that examination,\r\n\nwe  conclude  that  this appeal  is  wholly  frivolous  as it\r\n\npresents no issue having an arguable basis in law or fact.  \r\n\n     The   undisputed   facts   amply   support   defendant's\r\n\nconviction of the crimes charged, and the plea change hearing\r\n\ncovered  all  the  necessary   points.    Further,  defendant\r\n\nreceived the benefit of the safety valve provision, 18 U.S.C.\r\n\n  3553(f).  The court properly proceeded under the sentencing\r\n\nguidelines to calculate the base offense level for the amount\r\n\nof  cocaine involved and  to give  defendant the  full three-\r\n\nlevel credit for his acceptance of responsibility.  Defendant\r\n\nreceived  the minimum  sentence and  release terms  under the\r\n\napplicable  guidelines range.   Hence,  there is  no arguable\r\n\nappellate  issue  as  to defendant's  conviction,  plea,  and\r\n\nsentence.\r\n\n     Moreover,  no appealable issue  arises as to defendant's\r\n\nrequests for an additional downward adjustment or  departure.\r\n\nDefendant  did not  pursue those  requests at  the sentencing\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nhearing,  so they  may  be deemed  waived.   In  any case  he\r\n\npresented  no particular facts  justifying such an adjustment\r\n\nor departure based  on either his role in the  offense or his\r\n\nfamily responsibilities.   \r\n\n     Counsel's motion to withdraw is granted, and appellant's\r                                                        \r\n\nconviction and sentence are  affirmed.
