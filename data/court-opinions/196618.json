We  have carefully  reviewed  the\r\n\nrecord and petitioner's arguments.  \r\n\n     We will not  direct the Board to  reopen the proceedings\r\n\nto consider petitioner's new  evidence.  Petitioner failed to\r\n\nmeet the basic requirement  that he present material evidence\r\n\nthat  was not available and could not have been discovered or\r\n\npresented  at   the  former  hearing.     8  C.F.R.      3.2.\r\n\nPetitioner's evidence  was available to  him and discoverable\r\n\nby him at the time of the hearing.  \r\n\n     Petitioner  also failed  to present  a prima  facie case\r\n\nshowing  that he  is presently entitled  to an  adjustment of\r\n\nstatus.   Accordingly, the Board properly  declined to remand\r\n\nthe  proceedings to  allow  petitioner to  apply for  such an\r\n\nadjustment.  I.N.S. v.
