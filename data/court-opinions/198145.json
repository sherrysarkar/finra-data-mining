Gene Carter, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                 Selya, Stahl and Lynch,\r\n                    Circuit Judges.\r\n\n Henry W. Griffin on brief for appellant.\r\n Jay P. McCloskey, United States Attorney, George T. Dilworth,\r\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, and F. Mark Terison, Assistant U.S.\r\nAttorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nSEPTEMBER 24, 1998\r\n\n                                           Per Curiam.  Upon careful review of the briefs and\r\nrecord, we perceive no clear error in the district court's\r\napplication of an enhancement under U.S.S.G.  3C1.1.  The\r\nenhancement was warranted because, inter alia, defendant\r\nprovided false information about his identity to the magistrate\r\njudge.  See  3C1.1, application note 3(f).  We reject\r\ndefendant's arguments that his identity was not \"material\"\r\ninformation and that he did not provide the false information\r\n\"willfully.\"\r\n          We also perceive no clear error in the district\r\ncourt's denial of a reduction under U.S.S.G.  3E1.1, given the\r\ndistrict court's assessment of defendant's credibility and his\r\nshifting stories about his responsibility for the drugs.  See  3E1.1, application note 4.\r\n          Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r\n\n                           -2-\n",
