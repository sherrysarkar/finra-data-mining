From a federal court's perspective,\r\n\nthis special sort of judicial funambulism always  must proceed in\r\n\nthe spirit  of cooperative  federalism tempered, however,  by the\r\n\nneed to avoid the  pitfalls inherent in blind deference  to state\r\n\nautonomy.\r\n\n          The   case  at   hand   implicates   the  division   of\r\n\nresponsibilities between federal  and state judicial systems  but\r\n\ndoes not require us to walk a very high wire.  We need only tread\r\n\non solid  ground, previously paved  by the United  States Supreme\r\n\nCourt, and apply  the Court's teachings  to the peculiar  factual\r\n\nand legal  terrain  that underlies  this  appeal.   Because  that\r\n\nexercise persuades  us that the district court performed its task\r\n\nin  step with the principles  enunciated by the  Court, we affirm\r\n\nthe order from which the plaintiff appeals.\r\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          We supply a thumbnail sketch of the relevant facts.  In\r\n\n1992,  plaintiff-appellant Troy  E. Brooks  and Erica  Bodwell, a\r\n\nmember  of  the  New  Hampshire  bar,  engaged  in   an  intimate\r\n\nrelationship during a  period when Bodwell was separated from her\r\n\nhusband.  Bodwell  became pregnant.   She obtained  a divorce  in\r\n\nlate 1992, but the  final decree made no provision for her unborn\r\n\nchild.\r\n\n          Bodwell gave birth  to a  son in February  of 1993  and\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nsubsequently initiated  a paternity suit against  Brooks in which\r\n\nshe maintained that he  was the boy's biological father.   Brooks\r\n\nacknowledged paternity and the  court entered a provisional order\r\n\ncovering matters such as support, custody, and visitation.\r\n\n          Shortly thereafter,  Bodwell  reconciled with  her  ex-\r\n\nhusband, moved to discontinue  the paternity action, and, relying\r\n\non the  fact that  the child  was conceived while  she was  still\r\n\nmarried,  sought refuge in the presumption of legitimacy.  Brooks\r\n\nobjected  to the proposed dismissal of the paternity suit and set\r\n\nout to  confirm his  legal status  as the  boy's  father.   After\r\n\nnumerous skirmishes  concerning  paternity (not  relevant  here),\r\n\nBrooks  filed complaints  with  the New  Hampshire Supreme  Court\r\n\nProfessional  Conduct Committee  (the  Committee)  against  three\r\n\nattorneys,  including Erica  Bodwell, accusing  them  of flouting\r\n\nvarious ethical canons in  their handling of the paternity  suit.\r\n\nThe  Committee  dismissed  the  complaints  after  conducting  an\r\n\ninvestigation.\r\n\n          Brooks  then sought to put to use in the paternity suit\r\n\nboth the  fact that a disciplinary complaint  had been instituted\r\n\nagainst Erica  Bodwell and  certain evidence  to which  he became\r\n\nprivy during  the course of  the Committee's investigation.   His\r\n\nefforts were  thwarted by  a rule  prohibiting the disclosure  of\r\n\nknowledge  obtained during  the course  of attorney  disciplinary\r\n\nproceedings.  See  N.H. Sup.  Ct. R. 37(17)(a)  (1984).1   Brooks\r                           \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The  rule  in  effect  at  the  time,  with exceptions  not\r\nrelevant  here,   provided  that  all   records  and  proceedings\r\ninvolving   allegations  of   attorney   misconduct   \"shall   be\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nretorted by filing a pro se petition in the New Hampshire Supreme\r                                     \r\n\nCourt  (the  NHSC) in  which  he  contended that  Rule  37(17)(a)\r\n\nabridged  his First Amendment right to free speech and asked that\r\n\nthe rule be invalidated.\r\n\n          On March 23, 1995, the NHSC agreed to entertain Brooks'\r\n\npetition.  The court  scheduled briefing and oral argument  (with\r\n\nthe proviso that all matters connected with the proceeding remain\r\n\nconfidential).  Brooks then  retained counsel, Philip Cobbin, who\r\n\nfiled a brief  on his behalf.   The court accepted the  case on a\r\n\npaper record once Brooks and his attorney refused to  participate\r\n\nin oral  arguments behind closed doors.   The case has  yet to be\r\n\ndecided. \r\n\n          After the  matter  had  been  taken  under  advisement,\r\n\nBrooks, acting as his own attorney, sued the  members of the NHSC\r\n\nand of the Committee (and others, for good measure, including the\r\n\nstate bar association) in New Hampshire's federal district court.\r\n\nHis complaint  sought declaratory and injunctive  relief aimed at\r\n\nhalting the enforcement of  Rule 37(17)(a).  In what  amounted to\r\n\nanticipatory  disregard of that rule,  he attached a  copy of the\r\n\nNHSC's order  (agreeing to  entertain his  petition, but  only in\r\n\ncamera)  to  his  federal   court  complaint.    Attorney  Cobbin\r\n\nsubsequently  entered an  appearance  for Brooks  in the  federal\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nconfidential  and  shall not  be disclosed.\"    N.H. Sup.  Ct. R.\r\n37(17)(a).  The same rule also provided that \"participants in the\r\nproceedings  shall  conduct  themselves  so as  to  maintain  the\r\nconfidentiality  mandated   by  this   rule,\"  and   warned  that\r\n\"[v]iolation  of this duty shall constitute an act of contempt of\r\nthe supreme court.\"  N.H. Sup. Ct. R. 37 (17)(g).\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\ncourt and  moved for  a  preliminary injunction  designed (a)  to\r\n\nfreeze  the paternity suit until  the federal court  had ruled on\r\n\nBrooks' constitutional  claim, (b) to  force the NHSC  to dismiss\r\n\nBrooks' petition without prejudice, and (c) to prevent that court\r\n\nfrom exercising its contempt  powers under Rule 37(17)(g) against\r\n\nBrooks.    Without  requesting the  district  court  to  seal the\r\n\nrecord, Attorney  Cobbin included in the motion a copy of a brief\r\n\nfiled in the confidential proceeding.  Not surprisingly, the NHSC\r\n\npromptly directed  the Committee to determine  whether the lawyer\r\n\nhad violated Rule 37(17)(a).\r\n\n          The  district  court  refused  to  issue a  preliminary\r\n\ninjunction.   The court reasoned  that the proceeding  pending in\r\n\nthe NHSC called into  play the doctrine of Younger v. Harris, 401\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. 37 (1971); that Brooks' claim implicated  an important state\r\n\ninterest, namely, the administration of the attorney disciplinary\r\n\nsystem; that Brooks  could obtain a full and fair  hearing on his\r\n\nfederal constitutional claim before the state tribunal; and that,\r\n\ntherefore, the Younger doctrine  disabled the district court from\r                                \r\n\ngranting the requested relief.  This appeal ensued.2\r\n\nII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r          II.  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\n          Technically, this  is an appeal  from the  denial of  a\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2Following   oral  argument   on   this  appeal,   the  NHSC\r\nsubstantially revised Rule 37(17).   See N.H. Sup. Ct.,  Order of\r                                                  \r\nMarch  7,  1996 &amp;  appendices.   The  amendments take  some steps\r\ntoward meeting Brooks' objections by relaxing the confidentiality\r\nrestrictions  applicable  to  attorney disciplinary  proceedings.\r\nBut because the amendments  are without retroactive effect    the\r\nOrder  specifically   provides  that  the  amendments   shall  be\r\neffective as to complaints filed on or after March 7, 1996   they\r\nhave no significant impact on this appeal.\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\npreliminary   injunction,3  and   therefore  the   lower  court's\r\n\ndecision     assuming  that  it  applied  the  appropriate  legal\r\n\nstandard       ordinarily  must   stand   unless   the  appellant\r\n\ndemonstrates an  abuse  of  discretion.   See,  e.g.,  Weaver  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nHenderson,  984 F.2d  11,  12-13 (1st  Cir.  1993).

The primary integer  in the\r\n\npreliminary injunction calculus is the plaintiff's probability of\r\n\nsuccess on the merits.   See, e.g., Narragansett Indian  Tribe v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nGuilbert,  934  F.2d 4,  5  (1st  Cir. 1991).5    This means,  of\r                  \r\n\ncourse, that the  plaintiff must show a  likelihood of succeeding\r\n\nin the  pending proceeding.   When Younger applies,  the district\r                                                    \r\n\ncourt must refrain  from reaching the  merits of the  plaintiff's\r\n\nclaims  and, thus, there  is no  real possibility    let  alone a\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n          interests of the national  government, then the federal\r\n          court   may  exercise  a  modicum  of  discretion,  and\r\n          appellate  review is for abuse of that discretion.  See\r                                                                           \r\n          Chaulk Servs., Inc.  v.

Nonetheless,  the\r\n          district court's findings of fact, in contradistinction\r\n          to   its   ultimate   legal  conclusion   as   to   the\r\n          applicability  vel non  of  the Younger  doctrine,  may\r                                                           \r\n          evoke a more deferential standard of review.\r\n\n     5The  other  integers  in   the  calculus  include  (1)  the\r\nlikelihood of irreparable injury in  the absence of a preliminary\r\ninjunction, (2) the relative balance of hardships if the order is\r\nissued or denied,  and (3) the  effect on the public  interest of\r\ngranting  or   withholding  interim  injunctive   relief.     See\r                                                                           \r\nNarragansett Indian Tribe, 934 F.2d at 5.\r                                   \r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nlikelihood   that the  plaintiff will succeed  in his action.   A\r\n\nfortiori,  there can  be no  abuse of  discretion in  refusing to\r\n\ngrant preliminary injunctive relief.\r\n\nIII.  ANALYSIS\r          III.  ANALYSIS\r\n\n          Against this  backdrop, we  turn to a  consideration of\r\n\nwhether Younger  abstention is  appropriate in  this  case.   Our\r                         \r\n\nanalysis unfolds in four layers.\r\n\n                                A.\r                                          A.\r                                            \r\n\n          The Younger doctrine welds principles of federalism and\r                               \r\n\ncomity  into a fulcrum that can then  be used to achieve a proper\r\n\nbalance  between  sensitive federal  and  state  interests.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nYounger, 401 U.S. at 44.  Based on these principles, the  Younger\r                                                                           \r\n\nCourt articulated the  federal judiciary's obligation  to refrain\r\n\nfrom adjudicating the  merits of  federal claims where  to do  so\r\n\nwould  needlessly  inject  federal   courts  into  ongoing  state\r\n\ncriminal prosecutions.   See id.   Doctrinal  evolution over  the\r                                          \r\n\nnext  quarter-century  brought  other  types   of  ongoing  state\r\n\nproceedings,   including   civil   actions   and   administrative\r\n\nadjudications,  within the  ambit  of Younger  abstention.   See,\r                                                                          \r\n\ne.g., New Orleans  Public Serv., Inc.  v.

There  the New  Jersey  Ethics Committee  instituted  a\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\ndisciplinary proceeding  against a  defense lawyer who,  during a\r\n\ncriminal  trial,  had  made  statements  vilifying  the  judicial\r\n\nsystem.  See  id. at 428.   The lawyer  sued in federal court  to\r                           \r\n\nblock  the  disciplinary  proceeding   on  the  ground  that  the\r\n\nstandards of  professional conduct  relied upon by  the committee\r\n\nabridged  his  First  Amendment   rights.    The  district  court\r\n\nabstained, concluding that the  lawyer could raise his  claims in\r\n\nthe disciplinary  proceeding and  on subsequent  judicial review.\r\n\nThe Third Circuit reversed  on the basis that a  bar disciplinary\r\n\nproceeding did not provide a suitable forum for the  adjudication\r\n\nof the lawyer's constitutional claims.  643 F.2d 119.\r\n\n          The  Supreme  Court  reinstated  the  district  court's\r\n\nruling.   457 U.S. at 437.   In the process the Court established\r\n\nthe  basic   analytical  framework  that  still  governs  Younger\r                                                                           \r\n\nabstention.   Under this paradigm,  a federal court  must abstain\r\n\nfrom reaching the merits of a case over which it has jurisdiction\r\n\nso long as  there is  (1) an ongoing  state judicial  proceeding,\r\n\ninstituted  prior  to  the  federal  proceeding  (or,  at  least,\r\n\ninstituted  prior  to any  substantial  progress  in the  federal\r\n\nproceeding), that (2) implicates an important state interest, and\r\n\n(3)  provides an adequate opportunity for  the plaintiff to raise\r\n\nthe claims advanced in his federal lawsuit.  See id. at 432.\r                                                              \r\n\n                                B.\r                                          B.\r\n\n          The next step in  the pavane requires us to  apply this\r\n\ntripartite framework to the case at bar.\r\n\n          1.

See  New Orleans  Public\r                                                                           \r\n\nServ., 491 U.S. at 371 (listing rudiments of a judicial inquiry).\r               \r\n\nThe third proceeding    the embryonic contempt proceeding against\r\n\nCobbin  (which  Brooks,  in  all  events, may  lack  standing  to\r\n\ncontest)   is also judicial in nature.

See Middlesex, 457  U.S. at 433-34.   Consequently,\r                                     \r\n\nthe first prerequisite for Younger abstention is satisfied.\r                                            \r\n\n          2.   It  is  evident that  New  Hampshire has  a  vital\r                    2.\r\n\ninterest in regulating the  subject matter of Brooks' claims.   A\r\n\nstate's judicial system is  an important cog in  its governmental\r\n\napparatus, and  no judicial  system can function  smoothly unless\r\n\nthe attorneys who participate in it are held to high standards of\r\n\nprofessionalism and accountability.   See id.  at 434-35.   Thus,\r                                                       \r\n\nregulating   attorney  conduct  comprises   a  significant  state\r\n\ninterest  for purposes of Younger abstention.6  See id.; see also\r                                                                           \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6The defendants represent  the state's interest.   By way of\r\nillustration,   the   NHSC   is  charged   with   the   paramount\r\nresponsibility of establishing procedures and standards governing\r\nattorney discipline  \"that are emblematic of the character of the\r\nprofession.\"  Petition of Burling, 651 A.2d 940, 944 (N.H. 1994);\r                                           \r\nsee also N.H.

The  NHSC  has\r\n\nidentified no fewer than four  noteworthy purposes that the  rule\r\n\nserves:   (1)  protecting attorneys' reputations;  (2) protecting\r\n\ncomplainants' anonymity; (3) maintaining the integrity of pending\r\n\ninvestigations;  and (4)  preventing profligate  disclosures that\r\n\nmight endanger the interests of those sources from whom the state\r\n\nobtained  information  on a  confidential  basis.   See  State v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nMerski, 437 A.2d 710, 715 (N.H. 1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 943\r                                                             \r\n\n(1982).  Since  the rule's  proper operation is  itself of  great\r\n\nmoment  to New  Hampshire  citizens, the  second requirement  for\r\n\nYounger abstention is satisfied.7\r                 \r\n\n          3.   We also believe that the pending state proceedings\r                    3.\r\n\nallow an ample opportunity for Brooks to raise his constitutional\r\n\nchallenge.    The clearest  illustration  of  this  point is  the\r\n\nproceeding presently pending  before the NHSC (in  which the very\r\n\nissue that forms the centerpiece of Brooks' federal complaint  is\r\n\nraised,  briefed, and teetering on  the brink of  decision).  Any\r\n\nother assessment  would defile  the basic presumption  that state\r\n\ncourts are  fully capable of safeguarding  federal constitutional\r\n\nrights.

Board  of\r                                                                           \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     7Although  the  NHSC recently  amended  the  version of  the\r\nconfidentiality rule that is at issue here, see supra note 2, the\r                                                               \r\nstate nevertheless  retains a  strong interest in  preserving the\r\nexpectations of confidentiality created by the former regime.\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nRegistration in Medicine, 904 F.2d 772, 776 (1st Cir. 1990).\r                                  \r\n\n          Here, the  presumption is  reinforced because  the NHSC\r\n\nhas demonstrated unequivocally that  it takes questions anent the\r\n\nconfidentiality provisions  seriously.   See,  e.g., Petition  of\r                                                                           \r\n\nBurling,  651  A.2d  940  (N.H.  1994).     Indeed,  when  Brooks\r                 \r\n\ninterposed his objections to the confidentiality rule, the NHSC  \r\n\nwhich  could have  brushed  aside his  petition  as a  matter  of\r\n\ndiscretion   elected to entertain the objections, and did so in a\r\n\nproceeding that affords Brooks an adequate opportunity to present\r\n\nhis constitutional arguments.\r\n\n          Though Brooks  maintains  that the  NHSC proceeding  is\r\n\nless  than adequate  because of  its confidential  character, the\r\n\nSupreme  Court  has  never  suggested  that  having  an  adequate\r\n\nopportunity  to present  a  federal claim  requires the  parallel\r\n\nstate  proceeding be  open to  the public.   Rather, the  test is\r\n\nwhether  \"state  law  clearly   bars  the  interposition  of  the\r\n\nconstitutional  claims.\"   Moore v.  Sims,  442 U.S.  415, 425-26\r                                                   \r\n\n(1979).   Nothing in the  confidential nature of  the state court\r\n\nproceeding  constitutes such  a  bar.8    The third  (and  final)\r\n\nrequirement for Younger abstention is therefore satisfied.\r                                 \r\n\n                                C.\r                                          C.\r                                            \r\n\n          Fulfillment  of  the  three  requirements  for  Younger\r                                                                           \r\n\nabstention usually  ends the  federal inquiry.   See Bettencourt,\r                                                                          \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     8For what it may be worth, we note that, if the NHSC follows\r\npast practice, its eventual  disposition of Brooks' petition will\r\nbe embodied  in a published,  publicly accessible opinion.   See,\r                                                                          \r\ne.g.,  Petition of  Burling, 651  A.2d  940 (N.H.  1994); Astles'\r                                                                           \r\nCase, 594 A.2d 167 (N.H. 1991). \r              \r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\n904  F.2d at 779-80.   But even  if the Younger  requirements are\r                                                         \r\n\nsatisfied, a federal  court may nonetheless intervene  to halt an\r\n\nongoing state judicial  proceeding if the plaintiff  demonstrates\r\n\n\"bad  faith,  harassment,  or  any  other unusual  circumstance.\"\r\n\nYounger, 401 U.S. at 54.  Brooks suggests that his case trips the\r                 \r\n\nexception.   He bases this suggestion broadly, but the only point\r\n\nthat bears extended discussion  is his allegation that  the state\r\n\ntribunal is incompetent by reason of bias.\r\n\n          Judicial  bias  is  a recognized  basis  for  derailing\r\n\nYounger abstention, see, e.g., Gibson v. Berryhill, 411 U.S. 564,\r                                                            \r\n\n577-79  (1973), but  the claim  requires more  than the  frenzied\r\n\nbrandishing of  a  cardboard  sword.   Brooks'  claim  is  pasted\r\n\ntogether  from various  bits  and pieces  of marginally  relevant\r\n\ninformation.   For example, he notes that several Justices of the\r\n\nNHSC   have   advocated   confidential  treatment   of   judicial\r\n\ndisciplinary  proceedings; that  certain Justices  have testified\r\n\nbefore legislative committees  in opposition  to restrictions  on\r\n\nthe Chief  Justice's rulemaking  power; that  the NHSC  will only\r\n\nhear  oral argument on his petition behind closed doors; and that\r\n\nin  the  state  court  proceeding  the  Committee  has  staunchly\r\n\ndefended the validity of the confidentiality rule.  We think that\r\n\nsuch snippets, individually and collectively, are insufficient to\r\n\nshow cognizable bias.\r\n\n          In the first place,  the bias exception to the  Younger\r                                                                           \r\n\nabstention doctrine  is  inapposite if  an  ostensibly  aggrieved\r\n\nparty  fails  to  employ  available  procedures  for  recusal  of\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\nallegedly  biased  judges.    See  Middlesex,  457  U.S.  at 435;\r                                                      \r\n\nBettencourt,  904  F.2d at  780;  Standard  Alaska Prod.  Co.  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nSchaible,  874 F.2d 624, 629  (9th Cir. 1989),  cert. denied, 495\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S.  904 (1990).   Brooks  has never sought  the recusal  of any\r\n\nindividual Justice.  While he  attempts to justify this  omission\r\n\non the basis of  various tactical considerations and by  claiming\r\n\nthat  the NHSC's  standard recusal  mechanism is  inapplicable to\r\n\nproceedings  that  fall  within its  original  jurisdiction,  his\r\n\nexplanations lack force.   For this reason alone, his  claim must\r\n\nfail.\r\n\n          In  the  second place,  the  baseline  showing of  bias\r\n\nnecessary  to trigger  Younger's  escape mechanism  requires  the\r                                        \r\n\nplaintiff to offer some  evidence that abstention will jeopardize\r\n\nhis  due process right to an impartial adjudication.  See Gibson,\r                                                                          \r\n\n411  U.S. at 577; Bettencourt,  904 F.2d at  780.  The \"evidence\"\r                                       \r\n\nthat  Brooks presents does not approach this benchmark.  At most,\r\n\nBrooks'  claim depends on a purely conclusory allegation that the\r\n\nJustices of the NHSC are predisposed to uphold their own policies\r\n\nand  rules.    But an  entire  group  of  adjudicators cannot  be\r\n\ndisqualified  wholesale  solely  on   the  basis  of  an  alleged\r\n\ninstitutional  bias in favor of  a rule or  policy promulgated by\r\n\nthat group.   See, e.g., Doolin Security  Savs. Bank v. FDIC,  53\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.3d 1395, 1407 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 116 S.

Village of Monroeville, 409 U.S. 56,\r                                                             \r\n\n60 (1972), or a pecuniary stake in the outcome of the litigation,\r\n\nsee, e.g.,  Bettencourt, 904 F.2d  at 780 n.10.   For aught  that\r                                 \r\n\nappears,  the  Justices' interest  (if  any)  in maintaining  the\r\n\nprivacy of attorney disciplinary proceedings appears to be purely\r\n\nPlatonic.9  At least,  Brooks has not produced any  evidence that\r\n\nthe  NHSC  or  any individual  Justice  stands  to  gain or  lose\r\n\ndepending  on  whether   attorney  disciplinary  proceedings  are\r\n\nconducted in public or private, nor has he revealed the existence\r\n\nof any particularized  interest in the outcome  of his litigation\r\n\nthat might tend to undermine the Justices' impartiality.\r\n\n          In the third  place, to the extent that Brooks contends\r\n\nthat any individual Justice is  actually biased or has  prejudged\r\n\nhis case, he offers  no concrete evidence to that  effect.  Thus,\r\n\nhe bumps up against the historic presumption that judges are \"men\r\n\n[and women] of conscience and intellectual discipline, capable of\r\n\njudging a particular controversy  fairly on the basis of  its own\r\n\ncircumstances.\"   Withrow  v.  Larkin,  421  U.S. 35,  55  (1975)\r                                               \r\n\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  The presumption\r\n\nof  judicial impartiality  cannot  be  trumped  by  free-floating\r\n\ninvective, unanchored to specific facts.  See Kenneally, 967 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\nat 333; Bettencourt, 904 F.2d at 780 n.10.\r                             \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     9The structural bias claims, weak in all events, are further\r\nundermined by the recent  amendments to the confidentiality rule.\r\nSee supra note 2.   Those amendments, adopted without  dissent by\r                   \r\nthe Justices, liberalize the rule  in such a way as to  provide a\r\nstrong indication that the Justices are not wed to secrecy.\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\n                                D.\r                                          D.\r                                            \r\n\n          We add brief comments  concerning two other claims that\r\n\nBrooks seems to make.\r\n\n          1.    To the  extent that  Brooks  invites us  to forgo\r                    1.\r\n\nYounger  abstention because his attorney is the subject of a bad-\r                 \r\n\nfaith prosecution by the NHSC (arising out of disclosures made in\r\n\nviolation  of Rule  37(17)(a)  whilst  representing  Brooks),  we\r\n\ndecline  the invitation.   The NHSC's investigation  of Cobbin is\r\n\nnot  an  enforcement  proceeding brought  without  any  realistic\r\n\nexpectation of finding a violation of a rule; and, therefore, the\r\n\ninvestigation does  not catalyze  the bad-faith exception  to the\r\n\nYounger doctrine.   See Younger, 401 U.S. at  48; Fieger, 74 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n\nat 750; see also Dombrowski v.

In  something of  a non  sequitur, Brooks,  citing\r                    2.\r\n\nYounger,  claims  that  the threat  of  disciplinary  proceedings\r                 \r\n\nagainst   him   and   his   attorney  for   violations   of   the\r\n\nconfidentiality rule  chills the exercise of  his First Amendment\r\n\nrights,  and   that   the  confidentiality   rule  is   therefore\r\n\n\"flagrantly  and patently  violative  of  express  constitutional\r\n\nprohibitions  in every  clause,  sentence and  paragraph, and  in\r\n\nwhatever manner and against  whomever an effort might be  made to\r\n\napply it.\"  Younger,  401 U.S. at 53-54 (quoting Watson  v.

Here, Brooks\r                                            \r\n\nhas posited no other legally tenable basis for his challenge.\r\n\nIV.  CONCLUSION\r          IV.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We  need  go no  further.   Although  Brooks  raises an\r\n\nimportant question  about the interplay  between New  Hampshire's\r\n\nattorney  disciplinary  system  and  the  First  Amendment,  that\r\n\nquestion is  presently pending  before the New  Hampshire Supreme\r\n\nCourt in  a judicial  proceeding that Brooks  himself instituted.\r\n\nIf, in  the end, Brooks  is not content  with the result  of that\r\n\nadjudication, he may then seek certiorari in the Supreme Court of\r\n\nthe  United States.  He may not, however, rewardingly request the\r\n\nfederal district court to enjoin the state proceedings.\r\n\nAffirmed.\r          Affirmed.\r                  \r\n\n                                18\r\r\n",

We need only tread on solid ground, previously paved by the United States Supreme Court, and apply the Court's teachings to the peculiar factual and legal terrain that underlies this appeal.   Because that exercise persuades us that the district court performed its task in step with the principles enunciated by the Court, we affirm the order from which the plaintiff appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We supply a thumbnail sketch of the relevant facts.   In 1992, plaintiff-appellant Troy E. Brooks and Erica Bodwell, a member of the New Hampshire bar, engaged in an intimate relationship during a period when Bodwell was separated from her husband.   Bodwell became pregnant.   She obtained a divorce in late 1992, but the final decree made no provision for her unborn child.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bodwell gave birth to a son in February of 1993 and subsequently initiated a paternity suit against Brooks in which she maintained that he was the boy's biological father.   Brooks acknowledged paternity and the court entered a provisional order covering matters such as support, custody, and visitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter, Bodwell reconciled with her ex-husband, moved to discontinue the paternity action, and, relying on the fact that the child was conceived while she was still married, sought refuge in the presumption of legitimacy.   Brooks objected to the proposed dismissal of the paternity suit and set out to confirm his legal status as the boy's father.   After numerous skirmishes concerning paternity (not relevant here), Brooks filed complaints with the New Hampshire Supreme Court Professional Conduct Committee (the Committee) against three attorneys, including Erica Bodwell, accusing them of flouting various ethical canons in their handling of the paternity suit.   The Committee dismissed the complaints after conducting an investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brooks then sought to put to use in the paternity suit both the fact that a disciplinary complaint had been instituted against Erica Bodwell and certain evidence to which he became privy during the course of the Committee's investigation.   His efforts were thwarted by a rule prohibiting the disclosure of knowledge obtained during the course of attorney disciplinary proceedings.   See N.H.Sup.Ct.R. 37(17)(a) (1984).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Brooks retorted by filing a pro se petition in the New Hampshire Supreme Court (the NHSC) in which he contended that Rule 37(17)(a) abridged his First Amendment right to free speech and asked that the rule be invalidated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 23, 1995, the NHSC agreed to entertain Brooks' petition.   The court scheduled briefing and oral argument (with the proviso that all matters connected with the proceeding remain confidential).   Brooks then retained counsel, Philip Cobbin, who filed a brief on his behalf.   The court accepted the case on a paper record once Brooks and his attorney refused to participate in oral arguments behind closed doors.   The case has yet to be decided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the matter had been taken under advisement, Brooks, acting as his own attorney, sued the members of the NHSC and of the Committee (and others, for good measure, including the state bar association) in New Hampshire's federal district court.   His complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief aimed at halting the enforcement of Rule 37(17)(a).   In what amounted to anticipatory disregard of that rule, he attached a copy of the NHSC's order (agreeing to entertain his petition, but only in camera) to his federal court complaint.   Attorney Cobbin subsequently entered an appearance for Brooks in the federal court and moved for a preliminary injunction designed (a) to freeze the paternity suit until the federal court had ruled on Brooks' constitutional claim, (b) to force the NHSC to dismiss Brooks' petition without prejudice, and (c) to prevent that court from exercising its contempt powers under Rule 37(17)(g) against Brooks.   Without requesting the district court to seal the record, Attorney Cobbin included in the motion a copy of a brief filed in the confidential proceeding.   Not surprisingly, the NHSC promptly directed the Committee to determine whether the lawyer had violated Rule 37(17)(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court refused to issue a preliminary injunction.   The court reasoned that the proceeding pending in the NHSC called into play the doctrine of Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971);  that Brooks' claim implicated an important state interest, namely, the administration of the attorney disciplinary system;  that Brooks could obtain a full and fair hearing on his federal constitutional claim before the state tribunal;  and that, therefore, the Younger doctrine disabled the district court from granting the requested relief.   This appeal ensued.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Technically, this is an appeal from the denial of a preliminary injunction,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and therefore the lower court's decision--assuming that it applied the appropriate legal standard--ordinarily must stand unless the appellant demonstrates an abuse of discretion.   See, e.g., Weaver v. Henderson, 984 F.2d 11, 12-13 (1st Cir.1993).   If Younger applies, however, abstention is mandatory, see Colorado River Water Conserv.  Dist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 816 n. 22, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 1246 n. 22, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976);  Trust &amp; Investment Advisers, Inc. v. Hogsett, 43 F.3d 290, 293-94 (7th Cir.1994);  Fresh Int'l Corp. v. Agricultural Labor Relations Bd., 805 F.2d 1353, 1356 n. 2 (9th Cir.1986), and we must review de novo the essentially legal determination of whether the requirements for abstention have been met.   See, e.g., Trust &amp; Investment Advisers, 43 F.3d at 294;  Kenneally v. Lungren, 967 F.2d 329, 331 (9th Cir.1992), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 1054, 113 S.Ct. 979, 122 L.Ed.2d 133 (1993);  Traughber v. Beauchane, 760 F.2d 673, 675-76 (6th Cir.1985).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  That standard supervenes the abuse of discretion inquiry, and applies foursquare even though we are reviewing the district court's denial of injunctive relief.   See Fieger v. Thomas, 74 F.3d 740, 743 (6th Cir.1996) (exercising de novo review in kindred circumstances);  Goldie's Bookstore, Inc. v. Superior Court, 739 F.2d 466, 468 (9th Cir.1984) (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This usurpation of the customary standard of review does not create an awkward anomaly.   The primary integer in the preliminary injunction calculus is the plaintiff's probability of success on the merits.   See, e.g., Narragansett Indian Tribe v. Guilbert, 934 F.2d 4, 5 (1st Cir.1991).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  This means, of course, that the plaintiff must show a likelihood of succeeding in the pending proceeding.   When Younger applies, the district court must refrain from reaching the merits of the plaintiff's claims and, thus, there is no real possibility--let alone a likelihood--that the plaintiff will succeed in his action.   A fortiori, there can be no abuse of discretion in refusing to grant preliminary injunctive relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we turn to a consideration of whether Younger abstention is appropriate in this case.   Our analysis unfolds in four layers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Younger doctrine welds principles of federalism and comity into a fulcrum that can then be used to achieve a proper balance between sensitive federal and state interests.   See Younger, 401 U.S. at 44, 91 S.Ct. at 750.   Based on these principles, the Younger Court articulated the federal judiciary's obligation to refrain from adjudicating the merits of federal claims where to do so would needlessly inject federal courts into ongoing state criminal prosecutions.   See id.   Doctrinal evolution over the next quarter-century brought other types of ongoing state proceedings, including civil actions and administrative adjudications, within the ambit of Younger abstention.   See, e.g., New Orleans Public Serv., Inc. v. Council of City of New Orleans, 491 U.S. 350, 367-68, 109 S.Ct. 2506, 2517-18, 105 L.Ed.2d 298 (1989);  Ohio Civil Rights Comm'n v. Dayton Christian Sch., Inc., 477 U.S. 619, 627, 106 S.Ct. 2718, 2722, 91 L.Ed.2d 512 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perhaps the most revealing elucidation of the balance that the Younger Court wished to achieve is found in Middlesex County Ethics Comm. v. Garden State Bar Ass'n, 457 U.S. 423, 102 S.Ct. 2515, 73 L.Ed.2d 116 (1982).   There the New Jersey Ethics Committee instituted a disciplinary proceeding against a defense lawyer who, during a criminal trial, had made statements vilifying the judicial system.   See id. at 428, 102 S.Ct. at 2519.   The lawyer sued in federal court to block the disciplinary proceeding on the ground that the standards of professional conduct relied upon by the committee abridged his First Amendment rights.   The district court abstained, concluding that the lawyer could raise his claims in the disciplinary proceeding and on subsequent judicial review.   The Third Circuit reversed on the basis that a bar disciplinary proceeding did not provide a suitable forum for the adjudication of the lawyer's constitutional claims.  643 F.2d 119.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court reinstated the district court's ruling.  457 U.S. at 437, 102 S.Ct. at 2523.   In the process the Court established the basic analytical framework that still governs Younger abstention.   Under this paradigm, a federal court must abstain from reaching the merits of a case over which it has jurisdiction so long as there is (1) an ongoing state judicial proceeding, instituted prior to the federal proceeding (or, at least, instituted prior to any substantial progress in the federal proceeding), that (2) implicates an important state interest, and (3) provides an adequate opportunity for the plaintiff to raise the claims advanced in his federal lawsuit.   See id. at 432, 102 S.Ct. at 2521.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next step in the pavane requires us to apply this tripartite framework to the case at bar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.   Two of the three proceedings that Brooks seeks to enjoin--his petition questioning the constitutionality of Rule 37(17)(a) and the paternity suit in which he is embroiled--are pending before duly constituted state courts and are undeniably ongoing state judicial proceedings.   See New Orleans Public Serv., 491 U.S. at 371, 109 S.Ct. at 2519 (listing rudiments of a judicial inquiry).   The third proceeding--the embryonic contempt proceeding against Cobbin (which Brooks, in all events, may lack standing to contest)--is also judicial in nature.  Middlesex itself involved a First Amendment challenge to a state's system of attorney discipline, and the Supreme Court held that attorney disciplinary proceedings are judicial proceedings for purposes of Younger abstention.   See Middlesex, 457 U.S. at 433-34, 102 S.Ct. at 2521-22.   Consequently, the first prerequisite for Younger abstention is satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.   It is evident that New Hampshire has a vital interest in regulating the subject matter of Brooks' claims.   A state's judicial system is an important cog in its governmental apparatus, and no judicial system can function smoothly unless the attorneys who participate in it are held to high standards of professionalism and accountability.   See id. at 434-35, 102 S.Ct. at 2522-23.   Thus, regulating attorney conduct comprises a significant state interest for purposes of Younger abstention.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  See id.;   see also Fieger, 74 F.3d at 745;  Hirsh v. Justices of Calif.  Supreme Court, 67 F.3d 708, 712-13 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the same vein, the confidentiality rule comprises a central element of the regulatory scheme.   The NHSC has identified no fewer than four noteworthy purposes that the rule serves:  (1) protecting attorneys' reputations;  (2) protecting complainants' anonymity;  (3) maintaining the integrity of pending investigations;  and (4) preventing profligate disclosures that might endanger the interests of those sources from whom the state obtained information on a confidential basis.   See State v. Merski, 121 N.H. 901, 437 A.2d 710, 715 (N.H.1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 943, 102 S.Ct. 1439, 71 L.Ed.2d 655 (1982).   Since the rule's proper operation is itself of great moment to New Hampshire citizens, the second requirement for Younger abstention is satisfied.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.   We also believe that the pending state proceedings allow an ample opportunity for Brooks to raise his constitutional challenge.   The clearest illustration of this point is the proceeding presently pending before the NHSC (in which the very issue that forms the centerpiece of Brooks' federal complaint is raised, briefed, and teetering on the brink of decision).   Any other assessment would defile the basic presumption that state courts are fully capable of safeguarding federal constitutional rights.   See Middlesex, 457 U.S. at 431, 102 S.Ct. at 2520;  Bettencourt v. Board of Registration in Medicine, 904 F.2d 772, 776 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the presumption is reinforced because the NHSC has demonstrated unequivocally that it takes questions anent the confidentiality provisions seriously.   See, e.g., Petition of Burling, 139 N.H. 266, 651 A.2d 940 (1994).   Indeed, when Brooks interposed his objections to the confidentiality rule, the NHSC--which could have brushed aside his petition as a matter of discretion--elected to entertain the objections, and did so in a proceeding that affords Brooks an adequate opportunity to present his constitutional arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though Brooks maintains that the NHSC proceeding is less than adequate because of its confidential character, the Supreme Court has never suggested that having an adequate opportunity to present a federal claim requires the parallel state proceeding be open to the public.   Rather, the test is whether \"state law clearly bars the interposition of the constitutional claims.\"  Moore v. Sims, 442 U.S. 415, 425-26, 99 S.Ct. 2371, 2377-78, 60 L.Ed.2d 994 (1979).   Nothing in the confidential nature of the state court proceeding constitutes such a bar.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  The third (and final) requirement for Younger abstention is therefore satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fulfillment of the three requirements for Younger abstention usually ends the federal inquiry.   See Bettencourt, 904 F.2d at 779-80.   But even if the Younger requirements are satisfied, a federal court may nonetheless intervene to halt an ongoing state judicial proceeding if the plaintiff demonstrates \"bad faith, harassment, or any other unusual circumstance.\"  Younger, 401 U.S. at 54, 91 S.Ct. at 755.   Brooks suggests that his case trips the exception.   He bases this suggestion broadly, but the only point that bears extended discussion is his allegation that the state tribunal is incompetent by reason of bias.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judicial bias is a recognized basis for derailing Younger abstention, see, e.g., Gibson v. Berryhill, 411 U.S. 564, 577-79, 93 S.Ct. 1689, 1697-98, 36 L.Ed.2d 488 (1973), but the claim requires more than the frenzied brandishing of a cardboard sword.   Brooks' claim is pasted together from various bits and pieces of marginally relevant information.   For example, he notes that several Justices of the NHSC have advocated confidential treatment of judicial disciplinary proceedings;  that certain Justices have testified before legislative committees in opposition to restrictions on the Chief Justice's rulemaking power;  that the NHSC will only hear oral argument on his petition behind closed doors;  and that in the state court proceeding the Committee has staunchly defended the validity of the confidentiality rule.   We think that such snippets, individually and collectively, are insufficient to show cognizable bias.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first place, the bias exception to the Younger abstention doctrine is inapposite if an ostensibly aggrieved party fails to employ available procedures for recusal of allegedly biased judges.   See Middlesex, 457 U.S. at 435, 102 S.Ct. at 2522;  Bettencourt, 904 F.2d at 780;  Standard Alaska Prod.  Co. v. Schaible, 874 F.2d 624, 629 (9th Cir.1989), cert. denied, 495 U.S. 904, 110 S.Ct. 1923, 109 L.Ed.2d 287 (1990).   Brooks has never sought the recusal of any individual Justice.   While he attempts to justify this omission on the basis of various tactical considerations and by claiming that the NHSC's standard recusal mechanism is inapplicable to proceedings that fall within its original jurisdiction, his explanations lack force.   For this reason alone, his claim must fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the second place, the baseline showing of bias necessary to trigger Younger 's escape mechanism requires the plaintiff to offer some evidence that abstention will jeopardize his due process right to an impartial adjudication.   See Gibson, 411 U.S. at 577, 93 S.Ct. at 1697;  Bettencourt, 904 F.2d at 780.   The \"evidence\" that Brooks presents does not approach this benchmark.   At most, Brooks' claim depends on a purely conclusory allegation that the Justices of the NHSC are predisposed to uphold their own policies and rules.   But an entire group of adjudicators cannot be disqualified wholesale solely on the basis of an alleged institutional bias in favor of a rule or policy promulgated by that group.   See, e.g., Doolin Security Savs.  Bank v. FDIC, 53 F.3d 1395, 1407 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 473, 133 L.Ed.2d 402 (1995);  Hammond v. Baldwin, 866 F.2d 172, 177 (6th Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To implicate due process, claims of general institutional bias must be harnessed to a further showing, see Gibson, 411 U.S. at 579, 93 S.Ct. at 1698, such as a potential conflict of interest, see, e.g., Ward v. Village of Monroeville, 409 U.S. 57, 60, 93 S.Ct. 80, 82, 34 L.Ed.2d 267 (1972), or a pecuniary stake in the outcome of the litigation, see, e.g., Bettencourt, 904 F.2d at 780 n. 10.   For aught that appears, the Justices' interest (if any) in maintaining the privacy of attorney disciplinary proceedings appears to be purely Platonic.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  At least, Brooks has not produced any evidence that the NHSC or any individual Justice stands to gain or lose depending on whether attorney disciplinary proceedings are conducted in public or private, nor has he revealed the existence of any particularized interest in the outcome of his litigation that might tend to undermine the Justices' impartiality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the third place, to the extent that Brooks contends that any individual Justice is actually biased or has prejudged his case, he offers no concrete evidence to that effect.   Thus, he bumps up against the historic presumption that judges are \"men [and women] of conscience and intellectual discipline, capable of judging a particular controversy fairly on the basis of its own circumstances.\"  Withrow v. Larkin, 421 U.S. 35, 55, 95 S.Ct. 1456, 1468, 43 L.Ed.2d 712 (1975) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).   The presumption of judicial impartiality cannot be trumped by free-floating invective, unanchored to specific facts.   See Kenneally, 967 F.2d at 333;  Bettencourt, 904 F.2d at 780 n. 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add brief comments concerning two other claims that Brooks seems to make.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.   To the extent that Brooks invites us to forgo Younger abstention because his attorney is the subject of a bad-faith prosecution by the NHSC (arising out of disclosures made in violation of Rule 37(17)(a) whilst representing Brooks), we decline the invitation. The NHSC's investigation of Cobbin is not an enforcement proceeding brought without any realistic expectation of finding a violation of a rule;  and, therefore, the investigation does not catalyze the bad-faith exception to the Younger doctrine.   See Younger, 401 U.S. at 48, 91 S.Ct. at 752;  Fieger, 74 F.3d at 750;  see also Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U.S. 479, 482, 85 S.Ct. 1116, 1118, 14 L.Ed.2d 22 (1965).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. In something of a non sequitur, Brooks, citing Younger, claims that the threat of disciplinary proceedings against him and his attorney for violations of the confidentiality rule chills the exercise of his First Amendment rights, and that the confidentiality rule is therefore \"flagrantly and patently violative of express constitutional prohibitions in every clause, sentence and paragraph, and in whatever manner and against whomever an effort might be made to apply it.\"  Younger, 401 U.S. at 53-54, 91 S.Ct. at 754-55 (quoting Watson v. Buck, 313 U.S. 387, 402, 61 S.Ct. 962, 967, 85 L.Ed. 1416 (1941)).   But Younger itself belies this claim.   The Younger Court declared that \"a 'chilling effect,' even in the area of First Amendment rights, has never been considered a sufficient basis, in and of itself, for prohibiting state action.\"  Id. 401 U.S. at 51, 91 S.Ct. at 753;  accord Fieger, 74 F.3d at 750.   Here, Brooks has posited no other legally tenable basis for his challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.   Although Brooks raises an important question about the interplay between New Hampshire's attorney disciplinary system and the First Amendment, that question is presently pending before the New Hampshire Supreme Court in a judicial proceeding that Brooks himself instituted.   If, in the end, Brooks is not content with the result of that adjudication, he may then seek certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States.   He may not, however, rewardingly request the federal district court to enjoin the state proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The rule in effect at the time, with exceptions not relevant here, provided that all records and proceedings involving allegations of attorney misconduct \"shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed.\"   N.H.Sup.Ct.R. 37(17)(a).   The same rule also provided that \"participants in the proceedings shall conduct themselves so as to maintain the confidentiality mandated by this rule,\" and warned that \"[v]iolation of this duty shall constitute an act of contempt of the supreme court.\"   N.H.Sup.Ct.R. 37(17)(g)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Following oral argument on this appeal, the NHSC substantially revised Rule 37(17).   See N.H.Sup.Ct., Order of March 7, 1996 &amp; appendices.   The amendments take some steps toward meeting Brooks' objections by relaxing the confidentiality restrictions applicable to attorney disciplinary proceedings.   But because the amendments are without retroactive effect--the Order specifically provides that the amendments shall be effective as to complaints filed on or after March 7, 1996--they have no significant impact on this appeal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Despite Brooks' importuning, we have no appellate jurisdiction over the district court's denial of the flurry of temporary restraining orders that he sought prior to the district court's disposition of his motion for a preliminary injunction.   See United States v. Miller, 14 F.3d 761, 764 (2d Cir.1994);  Massachusetts Air Pollution &amp; Noise Abatement Committee v. Brinegar, 499 F.2d 125, 125 (1st Cir.1974)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Although several courts have applied an abuse of discretion standard in reviewing Younger abstention cases, see, e.g., Martin Marietta Corp. v. Maryland Human Relations Comm'n, 38 F.3d 1392, 1396 (4th Cir.1994);  O'Neil v. City of Philadelphia, 32 F.3d 785, 790 (3d Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1355, 131 L.Ed.2d 213 (1995);  Ramos v. Lamm, 639 F.2d 559, 564 n. 4 (10th Cir.1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1041, 101 S.Ct. 1759, 68 L.Ed.2d 239 (1981), context is the determining factor.   Where an attempt is made to apply the Younger doctrine under oddly configured circumstances, in a way that threatens the legitimate interests of the national government, then the federal court may exercise a modicum of discretion, and appellate review is for abuse of that discretion.

But for purposes of what the Chaulk majority called the \"customary case\"--of which the case at bar is a prototype--the Supreme Court has spoken preemptorily, see Colorado River, 424 U.S. at 816 n. 22, 96 S.Ct. at 1246 n. 22, and intermediate appellate courts are, therefore, spinning wheels by probing for abuse of a discretion that does not exist.

From a federal court's perspective, this special sort of judicial funambulism always must proceed in the spirit of cooperative federalism tempered, however, by the need to avoid the pitfalls inherent in blind deference to state autonomy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case at hand implicates the division of responsibilities between federal and state judicial systems but does not require us to walk a very high wire.   We need only tread on solid ground, previously paved by the United States Supreme Court, and apply the Court's teachings to the peculiar factual and legal terrain that underlies this appeal.   Because that exercise persuades us that the district court performed its task in step with the principles enunciated by the Court, we affirm the order from which the plaintiff appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We supply a thumbnail sketch of the relevant facts.   In 1992, plaintiff-appellant Troy E. Brooks and Erica Bodwell, a member of the New Hampshire bar, engaged in an intimate relationship during a period when Bodwell was separated from her husband.   Bodwell became pregnant.   She obtained a divorce in late 1992, but the final decree made no provision for her unborn child.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bodwell gave birth to a son in February of 1993 and subsequently initiated a paternity suit against Brooks in which she maintained that he was the boy's biological father.   Brooks acknowledged paternity and the court entered a provisional order covering matters such as support, custody, and visitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter, Bodwell reconciled with her ex-husband, moved to discontinue the paternity action, and, relying on the fact that the child was conceived while she was still married, sought refuge in the presumption of legitimacy.   Brooks objected to the proposed dismissal of the paternity suit and set out to confirm his legal status as the boy's father.   After numerous skirmishes concerning paternity (not relevant here), Brooks filed complaints with the New Hampshire Supreme Court Professional Conduct Committee (the Committee) against three attorneys, including Erica Bodwell, accusing them of flouting various ethical canons in their handling of the paternity suit.   The Committee dismissed the complaints after conducting an investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brooks then sought to put to use in the paternity suit both the fact that a disciplinary complaint had been instituted against Erica Bodwell and certain evidence to which he became privy during the course of the Committee's investigation.   His efforts were thwarted by a rule prohibiting the disclosure of knowledge obtained during the course of attorney disciplinary proceedings.   See N.H.Sup.Ct.R. 37(17)(a) (1984).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Brooks retorted by filing a pro se petition in the New Hampshire Supreme Court (the NHSC) in which he contended that Rule 37(17)(a) abridged his First Amendment right to free speech and asked that the rule be invalidated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 23, 1995, the NHSC agreed to entertain Brooks' petition.   The court scheduled briefing and oral argument (with the proviso that all matters connected with the proceeding remain confidential).   Brooks then retained counsel, Philip Cobbin, who filed a brief on his behalf.   The court accepted the case on a paper record once Brooks and his attorney refused to participate in oral arguments behind closed doors.   The case has yet to be decided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the matter had been taken under advisement, Brooks, acting as his own attorney, sued the members of the NHSC and of the Committee (and others, for good measure, including the state bar association) in New Hampshire's federal district court.   His complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief aimed at halting the enforcement of Rule 37(17)(a).   In what amounted to anticipatory disregard of that rule, he attached a copy of the NHSC's order (agreeing to entertain his petition, but only in camera) to his federal court complaint.   Attorney Cobbin subsequently entered an appearance for Brooks in the federal court and moved for a preliminary injunction designed (a) to freeze the paternity suit until the federal court had ruled on Brooks' constitutional claim, (b) to force the NHSC to dismiss Brooks' petition without prejudice, and (c) to prevent that court from exercising its contempt powers under Rule 37(17)(g) against Brooks.   Without requesting the district court to seal the record, Attorney Cobbin included in the motion a copy of a brief filed in the confidential proceeding.   Not surprisingly, the NHSC promptly directed the Committee to determine whether the lawyer had violated Rule 37(17)(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court refused to issue a preliminary injunction.   The court reasoned that the proceeding pending in the NHSC called into play the doctrine of Younger v. Harris, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108263\"><a href=\"/opinion/108263/younger-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108263\"><a href=\"/opinion/108263/younger-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This appeal ensued.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Technically, this is an appeal from the denial of a preliminary injunction,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and therefore the lower court's decision--assuming that it applied the appropriate legal standard--ordinarily must stand unless the appellant demonstrates an abuse of discretion.   See, e.g., Weaver v.

The primary integer in the preliminary injunction calculus is the plaintiff's probability of success on the merits.   See, e.g., Narragansett Indian Tribe v. Guilbert, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"561828\"><a href=\"/opinion/561828/narragansett-indian-tribe-v-paul-e-guilbert/\"><span class=\"volume\">934</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.1991).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  This means, of course, that the plaintiff must show a likelihood of succeeding in the pending proceeding.   When Younger applies, the district court must refrain from reaching the merits of the plaintiff's claims and, thus, there is no real possibility--let alone a likelihood--that the plaintiff will succeed in his action.   A fortiori, there can be no abuse of discretion in refusing to grant preliminary injunctive relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we turn to a consideration of whether Younger abstention is appropriate in this case.   Our analysis unfolds in four layers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Younger doctrine welds principles of federalism and comity into a fulcrum that can then be used to achieve a proper balance between sensitive federal and state interests.   See Younger, 401 U.S. at 44, 91 S.Ct. at 750.   Based on these principles, the Younger Court articulated the federal judiciary's obligation to refrain from adjudicating the merits of federal claims where to do so would needlessly inject federal courts into ongoing state criminal prosecutions.   See id.   Doctrinal evolution over the next quarter-century brought other types of ongoing state proceedings, including civil actions and administrative adjudications, within the ambit of Younger abstention.   See, e.g., New Orleans Public Serv., Inc. v. Council of City of New Orleans, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112302\"><a href=\"/opinion/112302/new-orleans-public-service-inc-v-council-of-city-of-new-orleans/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></a></span>, 367-68, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112302\"><a href=\"/opinion/112302/new-orleans-public-service-inc-v-council-of-city-of-new-orleans/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Garden State Bar Ass'n, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110750\"><a href=\"/opinion/110750/middlesex-county-ethics-comm-v-garden-state-bar-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">423</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110750\"><a href=\"/opinion/110750/middlesex-county-ethics-comm-v-garden-state-bar-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

There the New Jersey Ethics Committee instituted a disciplinary proceeding against a defense lawyer who, during a criminal trial, had made statements vilifying the judicial system.   See id. at 428, 102 S.Ct. at 2519.   The lawyer sued in federal court to block the disciplinary proceeding on the ground that the standards of professional conduct relied upon by the committee abridged his First Amendment rights.   The district court abstained, concluding that the lawyer could raise his claims in the disciplinary proceeding and on subsequent judicial review.   The Third Circuit reversed on the basis that a bar disciplinary proceeding did not provide a suitable forum for the adjudication of the lawyer's constitutional claims.  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"388077\"><a href=\"/opinion/388077/garden-state-bar-association-and-the-new-jersey-association-of-black-women/\"><span class=\"volume\">643</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">119</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court reinstated the district court's ruling.  457 U.S. at 437, 102 S.Ct. at 2523.   In the process the Court established the basic analytical framework that still governs Younger abstention.   Under this paradigm, a federal court must abstain from reaching the merits of a case over which it has jurisdiction so long as there is (1) an ongoing state judicial proceeding, instituted prior to the federal proceeding (or, at least, instituted prior to any substantial progress in the federal proceeding), that (2) implicates an important state interest, and (3) provides an adequate opportunity for the plaintiff to raise the claims advanced in his federal lawsuit.   See id. at 432, 102 S.Ct. at 2521.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next step in the pavane requires us to apply this tripartite framework to the case at bar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.   Two of the three proceedings that Brooks seeks to enjoin--his petition questioning the constitutionality of Rule 37(17)(a) and the paternity suit in which he is embroiled--are pending before duly constituted state courts and are undeniably ongoing state judicial proceedings.   See New Orleans Public Serv., 491 U.S. at 371, 109 S.Ct. at 2519 (listing rudiments of a judicial inquiry).   The third proceeding--the embryonic contempt proceeding against Cobbin (which Brooks, in all events, may lack standing to contest)--is also judicial in nature.  Middlesex itself involved a First Amendment challenge to a state's system of attorney discipline, and the Supreme Court held that attorney disciplinary proceedings are judicial proceedings for purposes of Younger abstention.   See Middlesex, 457 U.S. at 433-34, 102 S.Ct. at 2521-22.   Consequently, the first prerequisite for Younger abstention is satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.   It is evident that New Hampshire has a vital interest in regulating the subject matter of Brooks' claims.   A state's judicial system is an important cog in its governmental apparatus, and no judicial system can function smoothly unless the attorneys who participate in it are held to high standards of professionalism and accountability.   See id. at 434-35, 102 S.Ct. at 2522-23.   Thus, regulating attorney conduct comprises a significant state interest for purposes of Younger abstention.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  See id.;   see also Fieger, 74 F.3d at 745;  Hirsh v.

The NHSC has identified no fewer than four noteworthy purposes that the rule serves:  (1) protecting attorneys' reputations;  (2) protecting complainants' anonymity;  (3) maintaining the integrity of pending investigations;  and (4) preventing profligate disclosures that might endanger the interests of those sources from whom the state obtained information on a confidential basis.   See State v.

We also believe that the pending state proceedings allow an ample opportunity for Brooks to raise his constitutional challenge.   The clearest illustration of this point is the proceeding presently pending before the NHSC (in which the very issue that forms the centerpiece of Brooks' federal complaint is raised, briefed, and teetering on the brink of decision).   Any other assessment would defile the basic presumption that state courts are fully capable of safeguarding federal constitutional rights.   See Middlesex, 457 U.S. at 431, 102 S.Ct. at 2520;  Bettencourt v. Board of Registration in Medicine, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"542856\"><a href=\"/opinion/542856/paul-e-bettencourt-md-v-board-of-registration-in-medicine-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">904</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">772</span></a></span>, 776 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the presumption is reinforced because the NHSC has demonstrated unequivocally that it takes questions anent the confidentiality provisions seriously.   See, e.g., Petition of Burling, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">266</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">651</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">940</span></span> (1994).   Indeed, when Brooks interposed his objections to the confidentiality rule, the NHSC--which could have brushed aside his petition as a matter of discretion--elected to entertain the objections, and did so in a proceeding that affords Brooks an adequate opportunity to present his constitutional arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though Brooks maintains that the NHSC proceeding is less than adequate because of its confidential character, the Supreme Court has never suggested that having an adequate opportunity to present a federal claim requires the parallel state proceeding be open to the public.   Rather, the test is whether \"state law clearly bars the interposition of the constitutional claims.\"  Moore v. Sims, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110105\"><a href=\"/opinion/110105/moore-v-sims/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">415</span></a></span>, 425-26, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110105\"><a href=\"/opinion/110105/moore-v-sims/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Nothing in the confidential nature of the state court proceeding constitutes such a bar.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  The third (and final) requirement for Younger abstention is therefore satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fulfillment of the three requirements for Younger abstention usually ends the federal inquiry.   See Bettencourt, 904 F.2d at 779-80.   But even if the Younger requirements are satisfied, a federal court may nonetheless intervene to halt an ongoing state judicial proceeding if the plaintiff demonstrates \"bad faith, harassment, or any other unusual circumstance.\"  Younger, 401 U.S. at 54, 91 S.Ct. at 755.   Brooks suggests that his case trips the exception.   He bases this suggestion broadly, but the only point that bears extended discussion is his allegation that the state tribunal is incompetent by reason of bias.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judicial bias is a recognized basis for derailing Younger abstention, see, e.g., Gibson v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">488</span></a></span> (1973), but the claim requires more than the frenzied brandishing of a cardboard sword.   Brooks' claim is pasted together from various bits and pieces of marginally relevant information.   For example, he notes that several Justices of the NHSC have advocated confidential treatment of judicial disciplinary proceedings;  that certain Justices have testified before legislative committees in opposition to restrictions on the Chief Justice's rulemaking power;  that the NHSC will only hear oral argument on his petition behind closed doors;  and that in the state court proceeding the Committee has staunchly defended the validity of the confidentiality rule.   We think that such snippets, individually and collectively, are insufficient to show cognizable bias.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first place, the bias exception to the Younger abstention doctrine is inapposite if an ostensibly aggrieved party fails to employ available procedures for recusal of allegedly biased judges.   See Middlesex, 457 U.S. at 435, 102 S.Ct. at 2522;  Bettencourt, 904 F.2d at 780;  Standard Alaska Prod.  Co. v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">287</span></span> (1990).   Brooks has never sought the recusal of any individual Justice.   While he attempts to justify this omission on the basis of various tactical considerations and by claiming that the NHSC's standard recusal mechanism is inapplicable to proceedings that fall within its original jurisdiction, his explanations lack force.   For this reason alone, his claim must fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the second place, the baseline showing of bias necessary to trigger Younger 's escape mechanism requires the plaintiff to offer some evidence that abstention will jeopardize his due process right to an impartial adjudication.   See Gibson, 411 U.S. at 577, 93 S.Ct. at 1697;  Bettencourt, 904 F.2d at 780.   The \"evidence\" that Brooks presents does not approach this benchmark.   At most, Brooks' claim depends on a purely conclusory allegation that the Justices of the NHSC are predisposed to uphold their own policies and rules.   But an entire group of adjudicators cannot be disqualified wholesale solely on the basis of an alleged institutional bias in favor of a rule or policy promulgated by that group.

For aught that appears, the Justices' interest (if any) in maintaining the privacy of attorney disciplinary proceedings appears to be purely Platonic.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  At least, Brooks has not produced any evidence that the NHSC or any individual Justice stands to gain or lose depending on whether attorney disciplinary proceedings are conducted in public or private, nor has he revealed the existence of any particularized interest in the outcome of his litigation that might tend to undermine the Justices' impartiality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the third place, to the extent that Brooks contends that any individual Justice is actually biased or has prejudged his case, he offers no concrete evidence to that effect.

To the extent that Brooks invites us to forgo Younger abstention because his attorney is the subject of a bad-faith prosecution by the NHSC (arising out of disclosures made in violation of Rule 37(17)(a) whilst representing Brooks), we decline the invitation. The NHSC's investigation of Cobbin is not an enforcement proceeding brought without any realistic expectation of finding a violation of a rule;  and, therefore, the investigation does not catalyze the bad-faith exception to the Younger doctrine.   See Younger, 401 U.S. at 48, 91 S.Ct. at 752;  Fieger, 74 F.3d at 750;  see also Dombrowski v.

In something of a non sequitur, Brooks, citing Younger, claims that the threat of disciplinary proceedings against him and his attorney for violations of the confidentiality rule chills the exercise of his First Amendment rights, and that the confidentiality rule is therefore \"flagrantly and patently violative of express constitutional prohibitions in every clause, sentence and paragraph, and in whatever manner and against whomever an effort might be made to apply it.\"  Younger, 401 U.S. at 53-54, 91 S.Ct. at 754-55 (quoting Watson v.

Although Brooks raises an important question about the interplay between New Hampshire's attorney disciplinary system and the First Amendment, that question is presently pending before the New Hampshire Supreme Court in a judicial proceeding that Brooks himself instituted.   If, in the end, Brooks is not content with the result of that adjudication, he may then seek certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States.   He may not, however, rewardingly request the federal district court to enjoin the state proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The rule in effect at the time, with exceptions not relevant here, provided that all records and proceedings involving allegations of attorney misconduct \"shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed.\"   N.H.Sup.Ct.R. 37(17)(a).

See N.H.Sup.Ct., Order of March 7, 1996 &amp; appendices.   The amendments take some steps toward meeting Brooks' objections by relaxing the confidentiality restrictions applicable to attorney disciplinary proceedings.   But because the amendments are without retroactive effect--the Order specifically provides that the amendments shall be effective as to complaints filed on or after March 7, 1996--they have no significant impact on this appeal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Despite Brooks' importuning, we have no appellate jurisdiction over the district court's denial of the flurry of temporary restraining orders that he sought prior to the district court's disposition of his motion for a preliminary injunction.

Where an attempt is made to apply the Younger doctrine under oddly configured circumstances, in a way that threatens the legitimate interests of the national government, then the federal court may exercise a modicum of discretion, and appellate review is for abuse of that discretion.

But for purposes of what the Chaulk majority called the \"customary case\"--of which the case at bar is a prototype--the Supreme Court has spoken preemptorily, see Colorado River, 424 U.S. at 816 n. 22, 96 S.Ct. at 1246 n. 22, and intermediate appellate courts are, therefore, spinning wheels by probing for abuse of a discretion that does not exist.   Nonetheless, the district court's findings of fact, in contradistinction to its ultimate legal conclusion as to the applicability vel non of the Younger doctrine, may evoke a more deferential standard of review</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The other integers in the calculus include (1) the likelihood of irreparable injury in the absence of a preliminary injunction, (2) the relative balance of hardships if the order is issued or denied, and (3) the effect on the public interest of granting or withholding interim injunctive relief.

See, e.g., Petition of Burling, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">266</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">651</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">940</span></span> (1994);  Astles' Case, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">602</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">594</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></span> (1991)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The structural bias claims, weak in all events, are further undermined by the recent amendments to the confidentiality rule.   See supra note 2.   Those amendments, adopted without dissent by the Justices, liberalize the rule in such a way as to provide a strong indication that the Justices are not wed to secrecy</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
