Having carefully reviewed the record in this\r\n\nmatter, we are fully persuaded that the district court lacked\r\n\njurisdiction to grant the relief requested by the appellant in his\r\n\ninitial motion. Consequently, this appeal must be dismissed. We\r\n\nexplain briefly.\r\n\n          In general, federal courts are courts of limited\r\n\njurisdiction. In particular, a district court's authority to\r\n\nrevise a criminal defendant's sentence is restricted to those\r\n\nspecific instances in which Congress has granted jurisdiction. \r                                                                        See\r\n\nUnited \r                 States v. Blackwell, 81 F.3d 945, 947 (10th Cir. 1996);\r\n\nUnited States v. Angiulo, 57 F.3d 38, 41 (1st Cir. 1995).\r\n\n          In this instance, the appellant has not identified any\r\n\nstatute or rule conferring jurisdiction upon the district court to\r\n\nhear and determine his motion to amend sentence (which was filed\r\n\nmore than three years after the imposition of sentence). Nor has\r\n\nhe identified any other plausible basis on which such jurisdiction\r\n\nmight be predicated. Instead, he tries to premise jurisdiction\r\n\nover his motion on \"the ongoing equity jurisdiction of [the\r\n\ndistrict] court.\"  See Appellant's Reply Brief at 6. This effort\r\n\nis unavailing; the appellant cites no pertinent authority in\r\n\nsupport of the proposition and, as a general principle, federal\r\n\n     We emphasize that the appellant has resolutely refused to\r\ncharacterize the motion in question   which he terms a motion to\r\namend sentence   as a motion for relief under 28 U.S.C. S 2255\r\n(1994). In point of fact, the appellant did bring a      separate\r\nsection 2255 petition advancing substantially the same argument.\r\nThe district court denied the petition on October 21, 1996, and an\r\nappeal of that ruling is presently pending in this court (No. 96-\r\n2365). We take no view of that appeal in this proceeding.\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\ncourts have no \"equity jurisdiction\" in criminal cases.\r\n\n          That ends the matter. Because the district court lacked\r\n\njurisdiction to hear and determine the motion to amend sentence,\r\n\nthe court's order in respect thereto was a nullity,  as were the\r\n\ncourt's ensuing orders in regard to the various motions for\r\n\nreconsideration and intervention.\r\n\n          We need go no further. The defendant's appeal is\r\n\nsummarily dismissed.  See 1st Cir. R. 27.1.\r\n\n          Appeal dismissed\r                                   .  All parties will bear their own costs\r                                                                          .\r\n\n     The fact that the district court purported to act is of no\r\nmoment. A jurisdictional defect of this kind may be noticed at any\r\ntime.  See Fed R. Crim. P. 12(b)(2);   see also United \r                                                                 States v.\r\nDiSanto, 86 F.3d 1238, 1244 (1st Cir. 1996) (reaffirming that the\r\ndistrict court's supposed lack of jurisdiction may be raised for\r\nthe first time on appeal), cert. denied, 117 S.
