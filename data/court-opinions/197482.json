Appellant, Samuel Jordan, appeals his\r\n\nconviction after a jury trial of being a felon in possession of\r\n\na firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. S922(g)(1). He argues\r\n\nthat the district court committed prejudicial error in\r\n\nadmitting certain evidence of prior bad acts, in violation of\r\n\nFed. R.

If the\r\n\nevidence brings unwanted baggage, say, unfair prejudice or a\r\n\ncognizable risk of confusing the jury, and if the baggage's\r\n\nweight substantially overbalances any probative value, then the\r\n\nevidence must be excluded.\"     United  \r                                                   States v.

See United \r                                                               States v.\r\n\nRose, 104 F.3d 1408, 1413 (1st Cir.), \r                                                cert. denied\r                                                                S.Ct.   ,\r\n\n1997 WL 251219, 65 USLW 3798 (1997) (reasoning that \"[i]tems\r\n\nlinking Rose to pistols tended to corroborate [government\r\n\nwitness'] testimony that Rose was a participant in the\r\n\nconspiracy and had possessed the [pistol in question]\").\r\n\n     Although the evidence is undeniably prejudicial, the\r\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in gauging that the\r\n\nprejudicial impact of the evidence, which was reduced by the\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\ncourt's limiting instructions, did not outweigh its probative\r\n\nvalue. \"[I]t must be remembered that the trial judge is\r\n\nJohnny-on-the-spot; he has savored the full taste of the fray,\r\n\nand his considerable discretion must be respected so long as he\r\n\ndoes not stray entirely beyond the pale.\" \r                                                     Tierney, 760 F.2d at\r\n\n388.\r\n\n     2.

See United \r                                                        States v.  Davis,\r\n\n792 F.2d 1299, 1306 (5th Cir. 1986) (upholding admission of\r\n\nevidence that investigation of defendant initiated with a\r\n\nsearch for a machine gun as \"particularly relevant as placing\r\n\nin context\" and making more believable defendant's statements\r\n\nthat other guns that he was charged with possessing belonged to\r\n\nhim).\r\n\n     Nor did the district court err in calculating that the\r\n\nprejudicial impact of the \"context\" evidence did not outweigh\r\n\nits probative value. While testimony linking Jordan to a bank\r\n\nrobbery has significant potential for prejudicial impact, that\r\n\npotential was defused in several ways. First, the government's\r\n\nline of questioning was narrowly tailored to minimize the risk\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nof improper inferences. Second, the court's limiting\r\n\ninstructions, given directly after the testimony, further\r\n\nminimized the risk of unfair prejudice.\r\n\n     3. Testimony \r                              About \r                                    Jordan's \r                                              Statement \r                                                        that \r                                                             the \r                                                                 Gun \r                                                                      was\r\n\nStolen.\r\n\n     The district court admitted this evidence on the ground\r\n\nthat it was relevant to proof of the knowledge element of the\r\n\ncharged offense. Jordan argues that knowledge was not a\r\n\ncontroverted issue in this case. We need not resolve that\r\n\nquestion. Even if we assume (without deciding) that this\r\n\nevidence should not have been admitted under Fed. R. Evid.\r\n\n403(b), any error was harmless. Based upon our careful review\r\n\nof the record, \"it is highly probable that the error [,if any,]\r\n\ndid not contribute to the verdict.\"  Rose, 104 F.3d at 1414.\r\n\n     Appellant's conviction is affirmed.

While testimony linking Jordan to a bank\r\n\nrobbery has significant potential for prejudicial impact, that\r\n\npotential was defused in several ways.

Jordan argues that knowledge was not a\r\n\ncontroverted issue in this case. We need not resolve that\r\n\nquestion. Even if we assume (without deciding) that this\r\n\nevidence should not have been admitted under Fed. R. Evid.\r\n\n403(b), any error was harmless.
