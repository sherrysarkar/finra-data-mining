MALONEY; THOMAS F. REILLY, D.A.,\n\n                       Respondents, Appellees.\n\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n         [Hon. William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                        Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                   Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Margaret G. Barmack and Barmack & Boggs on brief for appellant.\n     James J. Arguin, Assistant Attorney General, and Thomas F. Reilly,\nAttorney General, on brief for appellees.\n\n\n                           February 12, 2002\n\f\f          PER CURIAM. Petitioner-Appellant Arthur Blake appeals the\n\ndenial of his petition for writ of habeas corpus challenging his state\n\ncourt conviction for armed assault with intent to murder, and related\n\nassault and weapons charges. Citing Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S.\n\n123 (1968), Blake claims first that the trial court violated his Sixth\n\nAmendment right to confront his accusers by admitting statements made\n\nby his non-testifying codefendants to the grand jury, and that the\n\nMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (“SJC”) failed to correct this\n\nerror on appeal. Second, Blake argues that the evidence underlying his\n\nconviction for assault with intent to murder as a joint venturer of\n\ncodefendant Damon Brown was constitutionally insufficient. Because\n\nneither argument has merit, we affirm the district court’s order.\n\n          The facts of this case have been explained previously, first\n\nby the SJC on direct review, Commonwealth v. Blake, 696 N.E.2d 929,\n\n930-31 (Mass. 1998), and then by this court on review of the habeas\n\npetition filed by Damon Brown, Brown v. Maloney, 267 F.3d 36, 38-39\n\n(1st Cir. 2001). For purposes of this opinion, the relevant facts are\n\nrecounted, albeit briefly, below.\n\n          Petitioner and Brown attended a “Caribbean Festival” on\n\nAugust 28, 1993, and were part of a large crowd gathered in Franklin\n\nPark. Later that day in the evening, after attempting to snatch a gold\n\nchain from the neck of Kerry Davis, who was also attending the\n\nFestival, Brown shot and injured several bystanders. Blake and another\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\ffriend of Brown, Angel Rentas, apparently also shot into the crowd\n\nafter Brown fired his weapon.1\n\n              Identification of the shooters was the central issue before\n\nthe jury. Although none of the defendants testified at trial, the\n\nprosecution introduced statements made by Blake and Brown to the grand\n\njury, in which they claimed that they had been at Rentas’s apartment\n\nfrom about 7:30 or 8:00 p.m. until approximately midnight, and knew\n\nnothing about the shootings. The government also introduced statements\n\nmade by Rentas to the grand jury that Blake and Brown left his\n\napartment somewhere between 9:00 and 9:30 p.m. Although Petitioner\n\nvehemently opposed the use of these statements by the government at\n\ntrial, his objections were overruled.\n\n              In his habeas petition, Petitioner alleges that the trial\n\ncourt violated the Supreme Court’s instruction in Bruton by improperly\n\nadmitting into evidence inculpatory statements of non-testifying co-\n\ndefendants that also implicated him, thereby infecting the trial with\n\nunfair prejudice.2 Damon Brown presented this precise argument in his\n\n\n\n\n       1   Rentas was acquitted at trial.     Blake, 696 N.E.2d at 930\nn.2.\n       2\n       Blake claims that the Commonwealth introduced these\nstatements to prove that he had offered a false alibi. As his\ndefense rested on a theory of misidentification, Blake insists\nthat any evidence that he had previously offered a (false) alibi\nwould poison the jury against him by suggesting that he had\nsomething to hide and was, in fact, one of the shooters.\n\n                                    -4-\n\fhabeas petition, the denial of which we recently affirmed.3 Brown, 267\n\nF.3d at 40-43.   As there is no reason for us to retread the same\n\nground, we reject Blake’s assignment of Bruton error for the reasons\n\noffered in Brown.    See id.\n\n          Blake’s contention that there was insufficient evidence to\n\nsustain his conviction as a joint venturer is also meritless. To prove\n\nthe existence of a joint venture under Massachusetts law, the\n\nprosecution must demonstrate that the defendant was “(1) present at the\n\nscene of the crime, (2) with knowledge that another intend[ed] to\n\ncommit the crime or with intent to commit a crime, and (3) by agreement\n\n[was] willing and available to help the other if necessary.\"\n\nCommonwealth v. Longo, 524 N.E.2d 67, 70 (Mass. 1988).           Blake\n\nacknowledges that the evidence at trial proved that he was at the scene\n\nand that he was firing a gun at approximately the same time as Brown.\n\nNevertheless, Blake maintains that the Commonwealth failed to satisfy\n\nthe third prong, citing the alleged lack of any direct evidence or\n\nbasis from which a jury could infer that he intended to help Brown kill\n\nDavis.   As the SJC concluded, however, the fact that Blake joined\n\nBrown after the initial shots were fired and also began to shoot in\n\n\n\n     3 Although Brown’s and Blake’s habeas petitions raised\nsubstantially similar issues, the motion to consolidate the two\npetitions was denied by both judges to whom the petitions were\noriginally allotted.     Consequently, Brown’s petition was\nconsidered by Judge Lasker, and Blake’s petition was considered\nby Chief Judge Young.\n\n                                 -5-\n\fDavis’s direction provides sufficient evidence to allow a jury to infer\n\nnot only “that Blake was available and willing to help Brown, but also\n\nthat he, in fact, did so.”       Blake, 696 N.E.2d at 934 (citing\n\nCommonwealth v. Williams, 661 N.E.2d 617, 625 (Mass. 1996)).4 We agree\n\nwith the district court that Blake has “fail[ed] to advance any\n\nevidence of an unreasonable determination of the facts” by the SJC,\n\nBlake v. Maloney, 142 F. Supp. 2d 135, 139 (D. Mass. 2000) (citing 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2254(d)(2)), and find no error in the proceedings below.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the district court’s denial of\n\nPetitioner’s habeas petition is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     4 Even assuming that Blake had no knowledge of Brown’s\nmalice toward Davis at the beginning of the evening, once Brown\nbegan shooting at Davis, Blake could no longer claim ignorance\nof Brown’s criminal intent. Therefore, to the extent that Blake\nalso seeks to challenge the sufficiency of his conviction under\nprong two, we reject his argument.\n\n                                 -6-\n\f",
