Ernest C. Torres, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                                   \r\n\n                    Before\r\n\n            Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n        Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n          and Boudin, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n                                   \r\n\nEdward F. St.Onge on brief for appellant.\r\nSheldon Whitehouse, United States Attorney, Margaret E. Curranand Kenneth P. Madden, Assistant United States Attorneys, on brief\r\nfor the United States.\r\n\n                                   \r\n\n                June 2, 1998\r\n\n                                             SELYA, Circuit Judge.  Defendant-appellant Sandro\r\nMartinez pled guilty to a single count of possessing a controlled\r\nsubstance with intent to distribute.  See 21 U.S.C.  841(a)(1)\r\n(1994).  The district court found that the substance in question\r\ncomprised 131.40 grams of cocaine base and 9.43 grams of powdered\r\ncocaine.  The court then determined that the cocaine base was crack\r\ncocaine, see United States v. Martinez, 981 F. Supp. 726, 727\r\n(D.R.I. 1997), and sentenced Martinez to 121 months in prison. \r\nMartinez appeals, contending that the government failed to prove\r\nthat the 131.40 grams of cocaine base was in fact crack cocaine.\r\nWe need not tarry.  In United States v. Robinson,    \r\nF.3d     (1st Cir. 1998) [No. 97-2185], we rejected an almost\r\nidentical challenge.  See id. at     [slip op. at 8-15].  We held\r\nsquarely that, once the government laid a proper foundation \"by\r\nintroducing a chemical analysis . . . proving that, chemically, the\r\ncontraband was cocaine base,\" id. at     [slip. op. at 12], no\r\nfurther scientific evidence was needed.  Instead, the government\r\ncould bridge the evidentiary gap between cocaine base and crack\r\ncocaine by presenting lay opinion evidence (or an opinion proffered\r\nby an expert who possessed practical as opposed to academic\r\ncredentials) from \"a reliable witness who possesses specialized\r\nknowledge\" (gained, say, by experience in dealing with crack or\r\nfamiliarity with its appearance and texture).  Id. at     [slip op.\r\nat 12-13].  These precepts are controlling here.\r\nTo be sure, there is one arguably significant difference\r\nbetween Robinson and the case at bar:  Martinez posits that the\r\ngovernment introduced \"[n]o testimony . . . as to the water\r\nsolubility or the melting point\" of the confiscated contraband. \r\nBrief for Appellant at 5.  That statement is true as far as it\r\ngoes, but it does not take Martinez very far.  Both solubility and\r\nmelting point constitute ways of distinguishing between cocaine\r\npowder (which is water-soluble but has a relatively high melting\r\npoint and therefore cannot be smoked) and cocaine base (which is\r\nnot water-soluble and which can be smoked because it has a lower\r\nmelting point).  See Robinson,     F.3d at     [slip op. at 11];\r\nUnited States v. Booker, 70 F.3d 488, 491 (7th Cir. 1995), cert.denied, 517 U.S. 1111 (1996).  Neither characteristic is of\r\nassistance, however, in distinguishing among forms of cocaine base. \r\nAs we wrote in  Robinson,     F.3d at     [slip op. at 12]:\r\n\"Chemical analysis cannot distinguish crack from any other form of\r\ncocaine base because crack and all other forms of cocaine base are\r\nidentical at the molecular level.  Thus, no further scientific\r\ntestimony would have been of any conceivable assistance, and we\r\nwill not require the government to indulge in an empty exercise.\" \r\nIn this case, as in Robinson, the government adduced\r\ncompetent scientific evidence   namely, the testimony of Gino\r\nRebussini, a chemist   to prove that the 131.40 grams of contraband\r\nassociated with the appellant's arrest was cocaine base.  Given the\r\nwitness's qualifications, his opinion constituted competent proof\r\nof the fact that the substance was cocaine base.  That further\r\ntests could have been conducted, but were not, goes to the weight\r\nof the evidence, not to its admissibility.  See, e.g., United\r\nStates v. Bond, 12 F.3d 540, 561 (6th Cir. 1993); Christophersen v.\r\nAllied-Signal Corp., 939 F.2d 1106, 1109 (5th Cir. 1991).  Factors\r\nsuch as water solubility and melting point, thereafter raised by\r\nthe defendant, went to the weight of the government's evidence, not\r\nto its admissibility.\r\nThat ends the matter.  Once the government adduced\r\nRebussini's testimony, no additional scientific evidence was\r\nexigible.  From that point forward, as in Robinson, competent lay\r\ntestimony, remarking the substance's distinctive appearance and\r\ntexture and identifying it as crack, forged the final link in the\r\nevidentiary chain.\r\nWe need go no further.  In Robinson, we said that \"[o]n\r\nthe strength of [such] proof, and in the utter absence of any\r\ncontroverting evidence,\" the district court's finding \"easily\r\nsurvive[d] clear-error review.\"  Robinson,     F.3d at     [slip\r\nop. at 13-14].  The same is true in this case.\r\n\nAffirmed.\n",
