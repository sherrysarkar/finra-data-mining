This is an insurance coverage\r                                           \r\n\ndispute  involving a  crime insurance  policy  issued by  Federal\r\n\nInsurance  Company (\"Federal\")  to Stop  &amp;  Shop Companies,  Inc.\r\n\n(\"Stop  &amp; Shop\").   Federal appeals the  district court's finding\r\n\nthat it must  indemnify Stop &amp; Shop for loss arising out of theft\r\n\nby  officers  of Hamilton  Taft  &amp; Company  (\"Hamilton  Taft\"), a\r\n\ncompany  employed  by Stop  &amp;  Shop  to  process and  pay  taxes.\r\n\nFederal  also challenges  the  district  court's  calculation  of\r\n\ndamages, and  Stop &amp; Shop cross-appeals denial  of its attorney's\r\n\nfees.  We  conclude that the authorized  representative exclusion\r\n\nin the crime insurance policy bars  recovery by Stop &amp; Shop.   We\r\n\ntherefore  reverse the district court's holding that Federal must\r\n\nindemnify  Stop &amp; Shop,  and leave  the attorney's  fees decision\r\n\nintact.\r\n\n                FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\n     The  material facts are essentially undisputed.  In February\r\n\n1990, Stop &amp; Shop purchased a crime insurance policy from Federal\r\n\nwhich  provided coverage for  \"direct losses caused by  the . . .\r\n\ndisappearance, wrongful  abstraction or Computer  Theft of  Money\r\n\nand Securities . .  . .\"1  The policy excluded  coverage for loss\r\n\ndue  to  the  \"[t]heft  or  any  other fraudulent,  dishonest  or\r\n\ncriminal  act .  .  .  by any  [e]mployee,  director, trustee  or\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Insuring Clause 2 provides coverage for such loss within or\r\nfrom the premises or banking premises; insuring clause 3 provides\r\nfor coverage from  such loss \"outside  the premises, while  being\r\nconveyed  by  the Insured,  .  .  .  or  any  other  person  duly\r\nauthorized by the Insured to have custody thereof. . . .\" \r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nauthorized  representative of the Insured whether acting alone or\r\n\nin collusion  with others.\"   Because we  find that the  issue in\r\n\nthis case turns  on the exclusion clause, we  detail only briefly\r\n\nthe  somewhat   unusual  circumstances  surrounding   the  losses\r\n\nsuffered by Stop &amp; Shop.  \r\n\n     Stop &amp;  Shop entered  into a tax  service agreement  in 1987\r\n\nwith Hamilton Taft, by which Stop &amp; Shop would deposit funds with\r\n\nHamilton Taft  and Hamilton  Taft would then  use these  funds to\r\n\nremit timely payments  to taxing authorities on behalf  of Stop &amp;\r\n\nShop.   The agreement allowed  Hamilton Taft to commingle  Stop &amp;\r\n\nShop  funds with  deposits from  other customers  and to  use the\r\n\nmoney  for  its own  investments  and  expenses  so long  as  tax\r\n\npayments owed by Stop &amp; Shop were made when due.  In 1989, Connie\r\n\nArmstrong assumed  control  of  the  company,  becoming  Hamilton\r\n\nTaft's sole shareholder, director and chief executive officer.  \r\n\n     In  1990, Stop  &amp; Shop  renewed  its contract  with Hamilton\r\n\nTaft,  after making certain  revisions.  These  included changing\r\n\nthe language, \"This agreement may  not be assigned to persons who\r\n\nare not employees of Hamilton Taft\" to \"This agreement may not be\r\n\nassigned by Hamilton Taft.\"  \r\n\n     In the  relevant period for this  case, Stop &amp; Shop  had tax\r\n\npayments due on  October 18, 1990, October 25,  1990, January 17,\r\n\n1991, and January 24, 1991, totalling $5,257,474 for October, and\r\n\n$7,632,269 for January.  On these  dates, Hamilton Taft employees\r\n\nprepared the checks  and recorded them as payments  made in their\r\n\naccounting logs.  As was standard practice with amounts in excess\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nof $100,000, the checks were then sent to the front office for an\r\n\nofficer's  counter-signature.    The checks  were  not,  however,\r\n\nmailed in the required period of time.  \r\n\n     Upon discovering that  its October and January  tax payments\r\n\nhad not  been made,  Stop &amp; Shop  contacted Hamilton  Taft, which\r\n\nultimately responded by  paying the October liability  on January\r\n\n31, 1991, and the January liability on March 8, 1991.  Around the\r\n\nsame time, a  former Hamilton Taft comptroller  reported to about\r\n\nthirty  Hamilton Taft clients that the company's executives, most\r\n\nnotably Armstrong, were  diverting client funds intended  for tax\r\n\npayments  and using  these funds  for their  personal use  or for\r\n\ninvestment  in other Armstrong-owned  companies.  In  late March,\r\n\nthree  Hamilton   Taft  clients  petitioned   the  company   into\r\n\ninvoluntary bankruptcy, and a Trustee was appointed.  The Trustee\r\n\ncalculated the loss  from improper diversion  of client funds  at\r\n\nover $55  million.   In January 1992,  the Trustee  demanded that\r\n\nStop &amp; Shop  repay the bankrupt estate for  the January and March\r\n\n1991  tax  payments made  by  Hamilton Taft,  arguing  that these\r\n\npayments were voidable preferences.2 \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2The Bankruptcy Code allows a bankruptcy trustee to:\r\n     .  . . avoid any transfer  of an interest of the debtor\r\n     in property --\r\n     (1) to or for the benefit of a creditor;\r\n     (2) for or on account of an antecedent debt owed by the\r\n     debtor before such transfer was made;\r\n     (3) made while the debtor was insolvent;\r\n     (4) made --\r\n          (A) on  or within 90  days before the date  of the\r\n          filing of the petition . . .\r\n11 U.S.C.   547(b).\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n     Litigation proceeded in federal  court in California,  where\r\n\nthe Ninth  Circuit ultimately agreed  that the January  and March\r\n\npayments were voidable preferences subject to repayment.  Shortly\r\n\nthereafter, Stop &amp; Shop settled with the Trustee for a portion of\r\n\nits tax liability.  It then  filed a claim in district court  for\r\n\nindemnification by Federal for its remaining loss; upon Federal's\r\n\nmotion  for  a   transfer  of  venue,  the  case   was  moved  to\r\n\nMassachusetts.   Federal  argued  that it  had  no obligation  to\r\n\nindemnify  because Stop  &amp; Shop's  loss  was not  direct and  the\r\n\npolicy's authorized representative  exclusion barred recovery for\r\n\ntheft  perpetrated by  Hamilton Taft  executives.   The  district\r\n\ncourt   found direct  loss and  held the exclusion  inapplicable.\r\n\nThe court  then awarded  damages to  Stop &amp;  Shop but  denied its\r\n\nrequest for attorney's fees.  Each side appeals.  \r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r\n\n     Although  the parties raise  multiple issues on  appeal, our\r\n\nconclusion on the exclusion clause issue makes it unnecessary  to\r\n\ndiscuss the  remaining ones.   We therefore begin  with Federal's\r\n\nclaim that the  clause bars coverage, and Stop  &amp; Stop's response\r\n\nthat  the clause is inapplicable because the responsible Hamilton\r\n\nTaft  executives diverted funds  for their personal  gain and not\r\n\nfor the benefit of the company.\r\n\n     Construction of insurance contracts and application of their\r\n\nterms to  facts are  matters  of law,  which we  review de  novo.\r                                                                          \r\n\nPreferred Mut.

The  district\r\n\ncourt  found   that  the  term  \"authorized  representative\"  was\r\n\nambiguous based on several factors:  it was not defined in either\r\n\nthe policy or case law, other  crime insurance contracts included\r\n\nexpress  terms excluding coverage, the parties' course of conduct\r\n\nin amending the Agreement suggested their specific intention that\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nHamilton  Taft and  not  Armstrong be  Stop  &amp; Shop's  authorized\r\n\nrepresentative, and no public  policy reasons precluded coverage.\r\n\nResolving the  ambiguity  in  favor of  the  insured,  the  court\r\n\ntherefore determined  that  Stop &amp;  Shop  was covered  under  the\r\n\npolicy for the losses sustained. \r\n\n     We find each of these  reasons lacking in force and conclude\r\n\nthat   the  language  in  context  is  susceptible  to  only  one\r\n\ndefinition, exclusion of coverage.  In the absence of a statutory\r\n\ndefinition, or  any relevant state law construction  of the term,\r\n\nwe  begin by  turning to  the lexical  meaning, as  Massachusetts\r\n\ncourts frequently do,  see, e.g., Gordon v. Safety  Ins. Co., 417\r                                                                      \r\n\nMass. 687, 690, 632 N.E.2d 1187, 1189 (1994), and to a thoughtful\r\n\nfederal case, Colson Services Corp. v.

Supp. at 68.\r\n\n     These   definitions   persuade   us   that  an   \"authorized\r\n\nrepresentative\"  can be either  a person or  company empowered to\r\n\nact on an entity's behalf.  Stop &amp;  Shop accepts this definition,\r\n\nbut  insists  that  in  this  case only  Hamilton  Taft  was  its\r\n\nauthorized  representative   and  that  individuals   who  behave\r\n\ninconsistently  with the interests of Hamilton  Taft, such as the\r\n\nexecutives who committed  the theft here,  cannot fall under  the\r\n\nexclusion.  \r\n\n     We repeat  at the  threshold the  fundamental premise  that,\r\n\nwhile  a corporation  does have  a  noncorporeal and  independent\r\n\nexistence, it can  conduct its affairs only through  its officers\r\n\nand  employees.  See  Holmes v. Bateson,  583 F.2d 542,  560 (1st\r                                                 \r\n\nCir. 1978).  Thus,  where Hamilton Taft is conceded to  be Stop &amp;\r\n\nShop's authorized representative,  it must also be  conceded that\r\n\nHamilton Taft may carry  out its obligations to Stop  &amp; Shop only\r\n\nthrough the acts  of its officers and employees.   Given this, we\r\n\nmust consider whether the term  omits acts by individuals  acting\r\n\nfor their own benefit.\r\n\n     Stop  &amp;  Shop  argues  that  the  authorized  representative\r\n\nexclusion is  at  minimum ambiguous  on  this point  because  the\r\n\npolicy does not delineate its  scope, as other policies have done\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nin the context of employee  exclusion clauses.  Before addressing\r\n\nthe specifics  of this argument,  we emphasize that  it stretches\r\n\nthe notion of  ambiguity to conclude  that language is  ambiguous\r\n\nbecause of something that is  not said.  Definitions of ambiguity\r\n\nrequire  examination of the language employed, see, e.g., Fashion\r                                                                           \r\n\nHouse,  892 F.2d at  1085, not the  language omitted.   With some\r               \r\n\nhesitancy  therefore we  address  Stop  &amp;  Shop's  argument  that\r\n\nambiguity   exists  because   the  exclusion   does   not,  after\r\n\n\"authorized representative,\" contain the language, \"while working\r\n\nor otherwise.\"  \r\n\n     A careful  review of the  cases cited  for this  proposition\r\n\nreveals their constant thrust, and the inappropriateness of their\r\n\nuse in  the instant  case.   For they  all actually  turn on  the\r\n\ntemporal scope of the  action -- specifically, whether the  theft\r                  \r\n\nwas committed outside of working  hours -- rather than the nature\r\n\nof authority given or the type of  behavior involved.  See, e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nCitizens  Ins.  Co.  of  New Jersey  v.

Rather, the Colson court explored only the definition of\r                                     \r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nemployees after  their shift is over -- in other words, after the\r\n\nperiod of time  during which they are actively  working for their\r\n\nemployer -- falls  under an employee  theft exclusion only  where\r\n\nthe \"while  working  or otherwise\"  language is  included in  the\r\n\npolicy. Other cases  have taken the contrary position,  but we do\r\n\nnot  discuss  them,  as  we   find  this  entire  line  of  cases\r\n\ninapposite.  We are  not involved here with when the diversion of\r                                                          \r\n\nfunds  occurred; certainly  no argument  has been  made that  the\r\n\nfraud  was  perpetrated at  any  time other  than  during working\r\n\nhours.    Nor  would  it  make sense  to  think  of  a  corporate\r\n\nauthorized representative as having working hours.\r\n\n     Indeed,  to the  extent  they  are  relevant,  the  employee\r\n\nexclusion  cases  support  Federal's  contention  that,  for  the\r\n\npurposes  of determining coverage,  it is irrelevant  whether the\r\n\nwrong  is perpetrated  for the  benefit of  Hamilton Taft  or the\r\n\nindividual.4   Even  the cases  applying  a temporal  restriction\r\n\nassume that if the temporal scope is satisfied, all inappropriate\r                                                             \r\n\nuse of funds is included under the exclusion, irrespective of who\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nthe  term \"authorized representative\"  in an effort  to determine\r\nwhether  an investment company that made  bad investments for the\r\ninsured  fell  under  the  applicable  crime  insurance  policy's\r\nauthorized representative  exclusion.   Id. at 67.   As  the case\r                                                     \r\nneither relied on  the \"while working or  otherwise\" language nor\r\nconcerned acts by individuals, it  does not support Stop &amp; Shop's\r\narguments.\r\n\n     4While   Federal  and   Stop   &amp;  Shop's   dispute  concerns\r\napplication of  the term \"authorized representative\"  rather than\r\n\"employee,\" we  agree with  Stop &amp; Shop  that the  way \"employee\"\r\nexclusions  have been interpreted  is instructive as  we consider\r\nhow  to construe  the  scope  of  the  authorized  representative\r\nexclusion.\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nbenefits from  the improper use.  None of  these cases so much as\r\n\nqueries  whether an employee who steals  for himself, rather than\r\n\nto add  to the company's  coffers, does not therefore  fall under\r\n\nthe exclusion. \r\n\n     As evidence  in support  of its  construction,  Stop &amp;  Shop\r\n\nmakes much of its 1990 modification to the Tax Service Agreement.\r\n\nInstead of adopting the standard language of Hamilton Taft's pre-\r\n\nprinted form, stating that the  agreement \"may not be assigned to\r\n\npersons  who are  not employees  of Hamilton  Taft,\" Stop  &amp; Shop\r\n\nrevised  the clause  to provide  that the  agreement \"may  not be\r\n\nassigned by Hamilton Taft.\"   The district court agreed that this\r\n\nchange indicated that  Stop &amp; Shop intended that  no entity other\r\n\nthan Hamilton Taft could be the authorized  representative.  This\r\n\nconclusion requires  reading too  much between  the  lines.   The\r\n\nrecord contains no evidence of  the context in which the contract\r\n\nrevision  was  made,  nor  gives  any  clue  as  to  why  it  was\r\n\nimplemented.  We see no  relationship between the revision and an\r\n\nunderstanding of the term \"authorized representative.\"  \r\n\n     Hamilton   Taft  can  act  only  through  its  officers  and\r\n\nemployees,  and the reality is that the grant of authority to the\r\n\nexecutives of  Hamilton Taft  enabled their  diversion of  funds.\r\n\nWhen we consider, too, that employee exclusion  clauses have been\r\n\nconstrued to encompass theft  for personal benefit, and that  the\r\n\npolicy  excludes   illegal  acts   by  employees,   directors  or\r\n\nauthorized representatives  without distinguishing  between these\r\n\ngroups, the intent of the exclusion is most readily understood as\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nan effort  to bar coverage of wrong committed by persons who have\r\n\nbeen granted access to the corporate funds.\r\n\n     Nor do  public policy  concerns play  an obvious role  here.\r\n\nThe district court, while conceding that the dispute in this case\r\n\nturns wholly on an interpretation of a contract clause and not on\r\n\nan equitable allocation  of risk between innocent  parties,5 felt\r\n\nvicarious  liability-agency law  provided useful guidance.   Some\r\n\nMassachusetts cases have  found companies liable for  the illegal\r\n\nactions of their  employees only where the employees  act for the\r\n\ncompanies'  benefit rather  than for  their own.   See  Kansallis\r                                                                           \r\n\nFinance Ltd. v. Fern, 421 Mass. 659, 665-69, 659 N.E.2d 731, 734-\r                              \r\n\n37 (1996) (reviewing existing case  law).  We do not  pursue here\r\n\nthe conflict  in the case law on this  issue, as we disagree with\r\n\nthe district court's assessment that these cases provide a useful\r\n\ncontext for  understanding the  present situation.   These  cases\r\n\nturn  on equitable allocation  of the financial  burden resulting\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5Federal   seeks  to  apply   the  alter  ego   doctrine  in\r\nfurtherance  of  its argument;  agreeing  with Stop  &amp;  Shop, the\r\ndistrict court found the doctrine  inapplicable to this case.  We\r\nsee  no  need to  ground  refusal  of  coverage in  this  complex\r\ndoctrine,  which  is   based  on  the  equitable   allocation  of\r\nliability.   Indeed, to apply it  would turn equitable allocation\r\non its head, for it was Stop &amp; Shop, not Federal, whose choice of\r\nHamilton Taft gave Armstrong access to the diverted funds.  \r\n     We are not faced here with equitable, public policy concerns\r\nabout placing  responsibility on  the guilty,  or more  culpable,\r\nparty, nor are we presented with a need to find an  extraordinary\r\nway to  impose liability  on a generally  untouched party.   This\r\ncase does  not involve a  creditor seeking to hold  an individual\r\nliable  for  misuse or  theft  of  funds,  nor  does it  seek  to\r\nguarantee  that a  wrongdoer  company does  not recover  under an\r\ninsurance  policy for  abuse  perpetrated  by  its  own  officer,\r\ndirector  or shareholder.  Hamilton  Taft is not  a party to this\r\naction, and  its liability for  the misappropriation of  funds is\r\nnot at issue here.  \r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nfrom bad  acts by  officers or  employees.  Where  a creditor  or\r\n\nthird  party suffers  at  the hands  of such  a  person, and  the\r\n\ncompany somehow  ratified the  improper act  or gave its  express\r\n\nauthority to perpetrate fraud, it  makes equitable sense for  the\r\n\ncompany to pay.  It is equally true that where a maverick officer\r\n\nor  employee perpetrates fraud against the company's interest and\r\n\nwithout the  company's express  or implied knowledge,  it may  be\r\n\nunfair  to hold the  company liable.   We are  not concerned here\r\n\nwith a  determination of  whether the  corporation Hamilton  Taft\r\n\nshould  be liable  to a  creditor for  the wrongful  acts of  its\r\n\nemployees.   It may be  that Stop &amp;  Shop suffered a  loss at the\r\n\nhands   of  Hamilton  Taft   employees  for  which   it  deserves\r\n\ncompensation.   But Stop &amp;  Shop's insurer, Federal, who  was not\r\n\nparty to the fraud, has no responsibility to reimburse for losses\r\n\nsuffered unless those losses are contractually covered.  \r\n\n     If we were to hold, as Stop &amp; Shop's argument would  have us\r\n\ndo, that an insurance  company must bear  the full cost of  theft\r\n\nonly  when it  was committed  by  an individual  working for  the\r\n\ninsured company's  authorized representative but  acting contrary\r\n\nto  the  representative's  interest,  the  exclusionary   clause,\r\n\ninsofar  as it deals with the authorized representative, wouldn't\r\n\naccomplish much.   The  policy underlying  the exclusion  clause,\r\n\nwhich  includes,   without  distinction,   employees,  directors,\r\n\ntrustees  and   authorized  representatives,   is  most   readily\r\n\nunderstood as  an effort  to  place on  the insured  the risk  of\r\n\npicking  a  faithless agent.    It  makes  little sense  for  the\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\nexclusion clause to encompass self-interested acts on the part of\r\n\nemployees,  but  not  on  the  part  of  those  working  for  the\r\n\nauthorized representative.6 \r\n\n     We come full  circle, then, to the contract.   The exclusion\r\n\nclause specifically states  that the crime insurance  policy does\r\n\nnot cover theft by an authorized representative.  The policy does\r\n\nnot restrict  the scope  of \"authorized  representative\" to  acts\r\n\nbenefitting Hamilton Taft,  the record contains no  evidence that\r\n\nsuch a restriction was contemplated, and no case law applies such\r\n\na  restriction.   In sum,  although exclusion  clauses are  to be\r\n\nnarrowly construed,  we find no  basis for imposing  the proposed\r\n\nlimit.   In  the  absence of  legally  cognizable  ambiguity,  we\r\n\nenforce the ordinary meaning of the words.  Bird, 11 F.3d at 232.\r                                                          \r\n\nIt  is most sensible  to consider \"authorized  representative\" as\r\n\none of a  series of capacities in which an individual who commits\r\n\ntheft may have been given access to funds by the insured.  We see\r\n\nuse  of the  term  as  a straightforward  effort  to embrace  all\r\n\nstatuses  that are  \"authorized,\"  and  thus  are  the  insured's\r\n\nresponsibility to supervise.  Because  Hamilton Taft can act only\r\n\nthrough   its  officers,  we  must  construe  this  exclusion  to\r\n\nencompass generally  acts by the  officers of Hamilton Taft.   As\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6Theft  and misappropriation  of funds  --  acts covered  by\r\ncrime insurance policies -- are  by their very nature most likely\r\nto be  committed for  individual rather  than corporate  benefit.\r\nCertainly,  an authorized representative company may, for its own\r\nbenefit, steal  an insured company's  funds, but we think  by far\r\nthe  more likely scenario is  that a person  with access to funds\r\nthrough  their employment position  will risk illegally acquiring\r\nthese funds for personal profit.\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\nofficers of  the corporate  representative, Armstrong and  others\r\n\nwere given access and power to divert funds.7\r\n\n     Finding that the  diversion of funds by officers of Hamilton\r\n\nTaft  falls under  Federal's authorized  representative exclusion\r\n\npolicy, we  reverse the  district court  decision,  and need  not\r                             \r\n\nreach the direct loss and damages questions raised on appeal.  As\r\n\nwe find Stop  &amp; Shop  is not covered  under Federal's policy,  we\r\n\ndeny its cross-appeal for attorney's fees.\r              \r\n\n     It is so ordered.\r                               \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     7This is particularly true where, as here, the officers were\r\nthe only persons  who could have  perpetrated the fraud,  because\r\nthey alone were endowed with the authority to co-sign checks over\r\n$100,000.\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n",

(\"Stop &amp; Shop\").  Federal appeals the district court's finding that it must indemnify Stop &amp; Shop for loss arising out of theft by officers of Hamilton Taft &amp; Company (\"Hamilton Taft\"), a company employed by Stop &amp; Shop to process and pay taxes.  Federal also challenges the district court's calculation of damages, and Stop &amp; Shop cross-appeals denial of its attorney's fees.  We conclude that the authorized representative exclusion in the crime insurance policy bars recovery by Stop &amp; Shop.  We therefore reverse the district court's holding that Federal must indemnify Stop &amp; Shop, and leave the attorney's fees decision intact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The material facts are essentially undisputed.  In February 1990, Stop &amp; Shop purchased a crime insurance policy from Federal which provided coverage for \"direct losses caused by the ... disappearance, wrongful abstraction or Computer Theft of Money and Securities....\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The policy excluded coverage for loss due to the \"[t]heft or any other fraudulent, dishonest or criminal act ... by any [e]mployee, director, trustee or authorized representative of the Insured whether acting alone or in collusion with others.\"   Because we find that the issue in this case turns on the exclusion clause, we detail only briefly the somewhat unusual circumstances surrounding the losses suffered by Stop &amp; Shop.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stop &amp; Shop entered into a tax service agreement in 1987 with Hamilton Taft, by which Stop &amp; Shop would deposit funds with Hamilton Taft and Hamilton Taft would then use these funds to remit timely payments to taxing authorities on behalf of Stop &amp; Shop.  The agreement allowed Hamilton Taft to commingle Stop &amp; Shop funds with deposits from other customers and to use the money for its own investments and expenses so long as tax payments owed by Stop &amp; Shop were made when due.  In 1989, Connie Armstrong assumed control of the company, becoming Hamilton Taft's sole shareholder, director and chief executive officer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1990, Stop &amp; Shop renewed its contract with Hamilton Taft, after making certain revisions.  These included changing the language, \"This agreement may not be assigned to persons who are not employees of Hamilton Taft\" to \"This agreement may not be assigned by Hamilton Taft.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the relevant period for this case, Stop &amp; Shop had tax payments due on October 18, 1990, October 25, 1990, January 17, 1991, and January 24, 1991, totalling $5,257,474 for October, and $7,632,269 for January.  On these dates, Hamilton Taft employees prepared the checks and recorded them as payments made in their accounting logs.  As was standard practice with amounts in excess of $100,000, the checks were then sent to the front office for an officer's counter-signature.  The checks were not, however, mailed in the required period of time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon discovering that its October and January tax payments had not been made, Stop &amp; Shop contacted Hamilton Taft, which ultimately responded by paying the October liability on January 31, 1991, and the January liability on March 8, 1991.  Around the same time, a former Hamilton Taft comptroller reported to about thirty Hamilton Taft clients that the company's executives, most notably Armstrong, were diverting client funds intended for tax payments and using these funds for their personal use or for investment in other Armstrong-owned companies.  In late March, three Hamilton Taft clients petitioned the company into involuntary bankruptcy, and a Trustee was appointed.  The Trustee calculated the loss from improper diversion of client funds at over $55 million.  In January 1992, the Trustee demanded that Stop &amp; Shop repay the bankrupt estate for the January and March 1991 tax payments made by Hamilton Taft, arguing that these payments were voidable preferences.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Litigation proceeded in federal court in California, where the Ninth Circuit ultimately agreed that the January and March payments were voidable preferences subject to repayment.  Shortly thereafter, Stop &amp; Shop settled with the Trustee for a portion of its tax liability.  It then filed a claim in district court for indemnification by Federal for its remaining loss;  upon Federal's motion for a transfer of venue, the case was moved to Massachusetts.  Federal argued that it had no obligation to indemnify because Stop &amp; Shop's loss was not direct and the policy's authorized representative exclusion barred recovery for theft perpetrated by Hamilton Taft executives.  The district court found direct loss and held the exclusion inapplicable.  The court then awarded damages to Stop &amp; Shop but denied its request for attorney's fees.  Each side appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the parties raise multiple issues on appeal, our conclusion on the exclusion clause issue makes it unnecessary to discuss the remaining ones.  We therefore begin with Federal's claim that the clause bars coverage, and Stop &amp; Stop's response that the clause is inapplicable because the responsible Hamilton Taft executives diverted funds for their personal gain and not for the benefit of the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Construction of insurance contracts and application of their terms to facts are matters of law, which we review de novo.

[I]t is sufficient if the language employed is such that a reasonable person, reading the document as a whole and in a realistic context, clearly points toward a readily ascertainable meaning.\"  Fashion House, Inc. v. K mart Corp., 892 F.2d 1076, 1085 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question for us is whether the actions of Hamilton Taft executives in diverting funds for their own gain fall under Federal's authorized representative exclusion.  The district court found that the term \"authorized representative\" was ambiguous based on several factors:  it was not defined in either the policy or case law, other crime insurance contracts included express terms excluding coverage, the parties' course of conduct in amending the Agreement suggested their specific intention that Hamilton Taft and not Armstrong be Stop &amp; Shop's authorized representative, and no public policy reasons precluded coverage.  Resolving the ambiguity in favor of the insured, the court therefore determined that Stop &amp; Shop was covered under the policy for the losses sustained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find each of these reasons lacking in force and conclude that the language in context is susceptible to only one definition, exclusion of coverage.  In the absence of a statutory definition, or any relevant state law construction of the term, we begin by turning to the lexical meaning, as Massachusetts courts frequently do, see, e.g., Gordon v. Safety Ins. Co., 417 Mass. 687, 690, 632 N.E.2d 1187, 1189 (1994), and to a thoughtful federal case, Colson Services Corp. v. Ins. Co. of North America, 874 F.Supp. 65 (S.D.N.Y.1994), which provide us with thorough and specific explanations of the term.  Black's Law Dictionary 133-34 (6th ed.1990) defines \"authorized\" as possessed of control or power delegated by a principal to his agent, and \"representative\" as \"a person or thing that ... in some way corresponds to, stands for, replaces, or is equivalent to, another person or thing .... includ[ing] an agent, an officer of a corporation or association ... or any other person empowered to act for another,\" id. at 1302.   Webster's Third New International Dictionary (Unabridged) 146 (1966) defines \"authorized,\" inter alia, as \"endorse[d], empower[ed],\" and \"representative\" as \"standing for or in the place of another:  action for another or others:  constituting the agent for another especially through delegated authority,\" id. at 1926-27.   The court in Colson relied on the Webster 's meaning, concluding that a company given authority by another company to act as its agent in choosing investments was an \"authorized representative\" under the relevant crime insurance policy.  874 F.Supp. at 68.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These definitions persuade us that an \"authorized representative\" can be either a person or company empowered to act on an entity's behalf.  Stop &amp; Shop accepts this definition, but insists that in this case only Hamilton Taft was its authorized representative and that individuals who behave inconsistently with the interests of Hamilton Taft, such as the executives who committed the theft here, cannot fall under the exclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We repeat at the threshold the fundamental premise that, while a corporation does have a noncorporeal and independent existence, it can conduct its affairs only through its officers and employees.  See Holmes v. Bateson, 583 F.2d 542, 560 (1st Cir.1978).  Thus, where Hamilton Taft is conceded to be Stop &amp; Shop's authorized representative, it must also be conceded that Hamilton Taft may carry out its obligations to Stop &amp; Shop only through the acts of its officers and employees.  Given this, we must consider whether the term omits acts by individuals acting for their own benefit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stop &amp; Shop argues that the authorized representative exclusion is at minimum ambiguous on this point because the policy does not delineate its scope, as other policies have done in the context of employee exclusion clauses.  Before addressing the specifics of this argument, we emphasize that it stretches the notion of ambiguity to conclude that language is ambiguous because of something that is not said.  Definitions of ambiguity require examination of the language employed, see, e.g., Fashion House, 892 F.2d at 1085, not the language omitted.  With some hesitancy therefore we address Stop &amp; Shop's argument that ambiguity exists because the exclusion does not, after \"authorized representative,\" contain the language, \"while working or otherwise.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A careful review of the cases cited for this proposition reveals their constant thrust, and the inappropriateness of their use in the instant case.  For they all actually turn on the temporal scope of the action--specifically, whether the theft was committed outside of working hours--rather than the nature of authority given or the type of behavior involved.  See, e.g., Citizens Ins. Co. of New Jersey v. Kansas City Commercial Cartage, Inc., 611 S.W.2d 302, 309-11 (Mo.Ct.App.1980);  Del Vecchio v. Old Reliable Fire Ins. Co., 132 N.J.Super. 589, 594-96, 334 A.2d 394, 397-98 (1975);  Sehon, Stevenson &amp; Co. v. Buckeye Union Ins. Co., 298 F.Supp. 1168, 1169-70 (S.D.W.Va.1969);  Century Indem. Co. v. Schmick, 351 Mich. 622, 627-28, 88 N.W.2d 622, 624-25 (1958).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  These cases have found that theft by employees after their shift is over--in other words, after the period of time during which they are actively working for their employer--falls under an employee theft exclusion only where the \"while working or otherwise\" language is included in the policy.  Other cases have taken the contrary position, but we do not discuss them, as we find this entire line of cases inapposite.  We are not involved here with when the diversion of funds occurred;  certainly no argument has been made that the fraud was perpetrated at any time other than during working hours.  Nor would it make sense to think of a corporate authorized representative as having working hours.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, to the extent they are relevant, the employee exclusion cases support Federal's contention that, for the purposes of determining coverage, it is irrelevant whether the wrong is perpetrated for the benefit of Hamilton Taft or the individual.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Even the cases applying a temporal restriction assume that if the temporal scope is satisfied, all inappropriate use of funds is included under the exclusion, irrespective of who benefits from the improper use.  None of these cases so much as queries whether an employee who steals for himself, rather than to add to the company's coffers, does not therefore fall under the exclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As evidence in support of its construction, Stop &amp; Shop makes much of its 1990 modification to the Tax Service Agreement.  Instead of adopting the standard language of Hamilton Taft's pre-printed form, stating that the agreement \"may not be assigned to persons who are not employees of Hamilton Taft,\" Stop &amp; Shop revised the clause to provide that the agreement \"may not be assigned by Hamilton Taft.\"   The district court agreed that this change indicated that Stop &amp; Shop intended that no entity other than Hamilton Taft could be the authorized representative.  This conclusion requires reading too much between the lines.  The record contains no evidence of the context in which the contract revision was made, nor gives any clue as to why it was implemented.  We see no relationship between the revision and an understanding of the term \"authorized representative.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hamilton Taft can act only through its officers and employees, and the reality is that the grant of authority to the executives of Hamilton Taft enabled their diversion of funds.  When we consider, too, that employee exclusion clauses have been construed to encompass theft for personal benefit, and that the policy excludes illegal acts by employees, directors or authorized representatives without distinguishing between these groups, the intent of the exclusion is most readily understood as an effort to bar coverage of wrong committed by persons who have been granted access to the corporate funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do public policy concerns play an obvious role here.  The district court, while conceding that the dispute in this case turns wholly on an interpretation of a contract clause and not on an equitable allocation of risk between innocent parties,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> felt vicarious liability-agency law provided useful guidance.  Some Massachusetts cases have found companies liable for the illegal actions of their employees only where the employees act for the companies' benefit rather than for their own.  See Kansallis Finance Ltd. v. Fern, 421 Mass. 659, 665-69, 659 N.E.2d 731, 734-37 (1996) (reviewing existing case law).  We do not pursue here the conflict in the case law on this issue, as we disagree with the district court's assessment that these cases provide a useful context for understanding the present situation.  These cases turn on equitable allocation of the financial burden resulting from bad acts by officers or employees.  Where a creditor or third party suffers at the hands of such a person, and the company somehow ratified the improper act or gave its express authority to perpetrate fraud, it makes equitable sense for the company to pay.  It is equally true that where a maverick officer or employee perpetrates fraud against the company's interest and without the company's express or implied knowledge, it may be unfair to hold the company liable.  We are not concerned here with a determination of whether the corporation Hamilton Taft should be liable to a creditor for the wrongful acts of its employees.  It may be that Stop &amp; Shop suffered a loss at the hands of Hamilton Taft employees for which it deserves compensation.  But Stop &amp; Shop's insurer, Federal, who was not party to the fraud, has no responsibility to reimburse for losses suffered unless those losses are contractually covered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If we were to hold, as Stop &amp; Shop's argument would have us do, that an insurance company must bear the full cost of theft only when it was committed by an individual working for the insured company's authorized representative but acting contrary to the representative's interest, the exclusionary clause, insofar as it deals with the authorized representative, wouldn't accomplish much.  The policy underlying the exclusion clause, which includes, without distinction, employees, directors, trustees and authorized representatives, is most readily understood as an effort to place on the insured the risk of picking a faithless agent.  It makes little sense for the exclusion clause to encompass self-interested acts on the part of employees, but not on the part of those working for the authorized representative.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We come full circle, then, to the contract.  The exclusion clause specifically states that the crime insurance policy does not cover theft by an authorized representative.  The policy does not restrict the scope of \"authorized representative\" to acts benefitting Hamilton Taft, the record contains no evidence that such a restriction was contemplated, and no case law applies such a restriction.  In sum, although exclusion clauses are to be narrowly construed, we find no basis for imposing the proposed limit.  In the absence of legally cognizable ambiguity, we enforce the ordinary meaning of the words.  Bird, 11 F.3d at 232.   It is most sensible to consider \"authorized representative\" as one of a series of capacities in which an individual who commits theft may have been given access to funds by the insured.  We see use of the term as a straightforward effort to embrace all statuses that are \"authorized,\" and thus are the insured's responsibility to supervise.  Because Hamilton Taft can act only through its officers, we must construe this exclusion to encompass generally acts by the officers of Hamilton Taft.  As officers of the corporate representative, Armstrong and others were given access and power to divert funds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finding that the diversion of funds by officers of Hamilton Taft falls under Federal's authorized representative exclusion policy, we reverse the district court decision, and need not reach the direct loss and damages questions raised on appeal.  As we find Stop &amp; Shop is not covered under Federal's policy, we deny its cross-appeal for attorney's fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Insuring Clause 2 provides coverage for such loss within or from the premises or banking premises;  insuring clause 3 provides for coverage from such loss \"outside the premises, while being conveyed by the Insured, ... or any other person duly authorized by the Insured to have custody thereof....\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The Bankruptcy Code allows a bankruptcy trustee to:</p>\n        <p>... avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property--</p>\n        <p>(1) to or for the benefit of a creditor;</p>\n        <p>(2) for or on account of an antecedent debt owed by the debtor before such transfer was made;</p>\n        <p>(3) made while the debtor was insolvent;</p>\n        <p>(4) made--</p>\n        <p>(A) on or within 90 days before the date of the filing of the petition ...</p>\n        <p>11 U.S.C. &#167; 547(b).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In Colson, 874 F.Supp. 65 (S.D.N.Y.1994), also cited for this proposition, the applicable policy excluded acts by an authorized representative \"while working or otherwise,\" but the case never discussed and in no way turned on the meaning of this clause.  Rather, the Colson court explored only the definition of the term \"authorized representative\" in an effort to determine whether an investment company that made bad investments for the insured fell under the applicable crime insurance policy's authorized representative exclusion.

This case does not involve a creditor seeking to hold an individual liable for misuse or theft of funds, nor does it seek to guarantee that a wrongdoer company does not recover under an insurance policy for abuse perpetrated by its own officer, director or shareholder.

(\"Stop &amp; Shop\").  Federal appeals the district court's finding that it must indemnify Stop &amp; Shop for loss arising out of theft by officers of Hamilton Taft &amp; Company (\"Hamilton Taft\"), a company employed by Stop &amp; Shop to process and pay taxes.  Federal also challenges the district court's calculation of damages, and Stop &amp; Shop cross-appeals denial of its attorney's fees.  We conclude that the authorized representative exclusion in the crime insurance policy bars recovery by Stop &amp; Shop.  We therefore reverse the district court's holding that Federal must indemnify Stop &amp; Shop, and leave the attorney's fees decision intact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The material facts are essentially undisputed.  In February 1990, Stop &amp; Shop purchased a crime insurance policy from Federal which provided coverage for \"direct losses caused by the ... disappearance, wrongful abstraction or Computer Theft of Money and Securities....\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The policy excluded coverage for loss due to the \"[t]heft or any other fraudulent, dishonest or criminal act ... by any [e]mployee, director, trustee or authorized representative of the Insured whether acting alone or in collusion with others.\"   Because we find that the issue in this case turns on the exclusion clause, we detail only briefly the somewhat unusual circumstances surrounding the losses suffered by Stop &amp; Shop.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stop &amp; Shop entered into a tax service agreement in 1987 with Hamilton Taft, by which Stop &amp; Shop would deposit funds with Hamilton Taft and Hamilton Taft would then use these funds to remit timely payments to taxing authorities on behalf of Stop &amp; Shop.  The agreement allowed Hamilton Taft to commingle Stop &amp; Shop funds with deposits from other customers and to use the money for its own investments and expenses so long as tax payments owed by Stop &amp; Shop were made when due.  In 1989, Connie Armstrong assumed control of the company, becoming Hamilton Taft's sole shareholder, director and chief executive officer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1990, Stop &amp; Shop renewed its contract with Hamilton Taft, after making certain revisions.  These included changing the language, \"This agreement may not be assigned to persons who are not employees of Hamilton Taft\" to \"This agreement may not be assigned by Hamilton Taft.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the relevant period for this case, Stop &amp; Shop had tax payments due on October 18, 1990, October 25, 1990, January 17, 1991, and January 24, 1991, totalling $5,257,474 for October, and $7,632,269 for January.  On these dates, Hamilton Taft employees prepared the checks and recorded them as payments made in their accounting logs.  As was standard practice with amounts in excess of $100,000, the checks were then sent to the front office for an officer's counter-signature.  The checks were not, however, mailed in the required period of time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon discovering that its October and January tax payments had not been made, Stop &amp; Shop contacted Hamilton Taft, which ultimately responded by paying the October liability on January 31, 1991, and the January liability on March 8, 1991.  Around the same time, a former Hamilton Taft comptroller reported to about thirty Hamilton Taft clients that the company's executives, most notably Armstrong, were diverting client funds intended for tax payments and using these funds for their personal use or for investment in other Armstrong-owned companies.  In late March, three Hamilton Taft clients petitioned the company into involuntary bankruptcy, and a Trustee was appointed.  The Trustee calculated the loss from improper diversion of client funds at over $55 million.  In January 1992, the Trustee demanded that Stop &amp; Shop repay the bankrupt estate for the January and March 1991 tax payments made by Hamilton Taft, arguing that these payments were voidable preferences.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Litigation proceeded in federal court in California, where the Ninth Circuit ultimately agreed that the January and March payments were voidable preferences subject to repayment.  Shortly thereafter, Stop &amp; Shop settled with the Trustee for a portion of its tax liability.  It then filed a claim in district court for indemnification by Federal for its remaining loss;  upon Federal's motion for a transfer of venue, the case was moved to Massachusetts.  Federal argued that it had no obligation to indemnify because Stop &amp; Shop's loss was not direct and the policy's authorized representative exclusion barred recovery for theft perpetrated by Hamilton Taft executives.  The district court found direct loss and held the exclusion inapplicable.  The court then awarded damages to Stop &amp; Shop but denied its request for attorney's fees.  Each side appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the parties raise multiple issues on appeal, our conclusion on the exclusion clause issue makes it unnecessary to discuss the remaining ones.  We therefore begin with Federal's claim that the clause bars coverage, and Stop &amp; Stop's response that the clause is inapplicable because the responsible Hamilton Taft executives diverted funds for their personal gain and not for the benefit of the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Construction of insurance contracts and application of their terms to facts are matters of law, which we review de novo.

K mart Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"534521\"><a href=\"/opinion/534521/fashion-house-inc-v-k-mart-corporation-fashion-house-inc-v-k-mart/\"><span class=\"volume\">892</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1076</span></a></span>, 1085 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question for us is whether the actions of Hamilton Taft executives in diverting funds for their own gain fall under Federal's authorized representative exclusion.  The district court found that the term \"authorized representative\" was ambiguous based on several factors:  it was not defined in either the policy or case law, other crime insurance contracts included express terms excluding coverage, the parties' course of conduct in amending the Agreement suggested their specific intention that Hamilton Taft and not Armstrong be Stop &amp; Shop's authorized representative, and no public policy reasons precluded coverage.  Resolving the ambiguity in favor of the insured, the court therefore determined that Stop &amp; Shop was covered under the policy for the losses sustained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find each of these reasons lacking in force and conclude that the language in context is susceptible to only one definition, exclusion of coverage.  In the absence of a statutory definition, or any relevant state law construction of the term, we begin by turning to the lexical meaning, as Massachusetts courts frequently do, see, e.g., Gordon v. Safety Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2047562\"><a href=\"/opinion/2047562/gordon-v-safety-insurance-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">687</span></a></span>, 690, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2047562\"><a href=\"/opinion/2047562/gordon-v-safety-insurance-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">632</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1187</span></a></span>, 1189 (1994), and to a thoughtful federal case, Colson Services Corp. v. Ins. Co. of North America, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></span> (S.D.N.Y.1994), which provide us with thorough and specific explanations of the term.  Black's Law Dictionary 133-34 (6th ed.1990) defines \"authorized\" as possessed of control or power delegated by a principal to his agent, and \"representative\" as \"a person or thing that ... in some way corresponds to, stands for, replaces, or is equivalent to, another person or thing .... includ[ing] an agent, an officer of a corporation or association ... or any other person empowered to act for another,\" id. at 1302.   Webster's Third New International Dictionary (Unabridged) 146 (1966) defines \"authorized,\" inter alia, as \"endorse[d], empower[ed],\" and \"representative\" as \"standing for or in the place of another:  action for another or others:  constituting the agent for another especially through delegated authority,\" id. at 1926-27.   The court in Colson relied on the Webster 's meaning, concluding that a company given authority by another company to act as its agent in choosing investments was an \"authorized representative\" under the relevant crime insurance policy.  874 F.Supp. at 68.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These definitions persuade us that an \"authorized representative\" can be either a person or company empowered to act on an entity's behalf.  Stop &amp; Shop accepts this definition, but insists that in this case only Hamilton Taft was its authorized representative and that individuals who behave inconsistently with the interests of Hamilton Taft, such as the executives who committed the theft here, cannot fall under the exclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We repeat at the threshold the fundamental premise that, while a corporation does have a noncorporeal and independent existence, it can conduct its affairs only through its officers and employees.  See Holmes v. Bateson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"359617\"><a href=\"/opinion/359617/fed-sec-l-rep-p-96532-elizabeth-d-holmes-and-industrial-national-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">583</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">542</span></a></span>, 560 (1st Cir.1978).  Thus, where Hamilton Taft is conceded to be Stop &amp; Shop's authorized representative, it must also be conceded that Hamilton Taft may carry out its obligations to Stop &amp; Shop only through the acts of its officers and employees.  Given this, we must consider whether the term omits acts by individuals acting for their own benefit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stop &amp; Shop argues that the authorized representative exclusion is at minimum ambiguous on this point because the policy does not delineate its scope, as other policies have done in the context of employee exclusion clauses.  Before addressing the specifics of this argument, we emphasize that it stretches the notion of ambiguity to conclude that language is ambiguous because of something that is not said.  Definitions of ambiguity require examination of the language employed, see, e.g., Fashion House, 892 F.2d at 1085, not the language omitted.  With some hesitancy therefore we address Stop &amp; Shop's argument that ambiguity exists because the exclusion does not, after \"authorized representative,\" contain the language, \"while working or otherwise.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A careful review of the cases cited for this proposition reveals their constant thrust, and the inappropriateness of their use in the instant case.  For they all actually turn on the temporal scope of the action--specifically, whether the theft was committed outside of working hours--rather than the nature of authority given or the type of behavior involved.  See, e.g., Citizens Ins. Co. of New Jersey v. Kansas City Commercial Cartage, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1679749\"><a href=\"/opinion/1679749/citizens-ins-co-of-new-jersey-v-kansas-city-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">611</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span>, 309-11 (Mo.Ct.App.1980);  Del Vecchio v.

Other cases have taken the contrary position, but we do not discuss them, as we find this entire line of cases inapposite.  We are not involved here with when the diversion of funds occurred;  certainly no argument has been made that the fraud was perpetrated at any time other than during working hours.  Nor would it make sense to think of a corporate authorized representative as having working hours.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, to the extent they are relevant, the employee exclusion cases support Federal's contention that, for the purposes of determining coverage, it is irrelevant whether the wrong is perpetrated for the benefit of Hamilton Taft or the individual.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Even the cases applying a temporal restriction assume that if the temporal scope is satisfied, all inappropriate use of funds is included under the exclusion, irrespective of who benefits from the improper use.  None of these cases so much as queries whether an employee who steals for himself, rather than to add to the company's coffers, does not therefore fall under the exclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As evidence in support of its construction, Stop &amp; Shop makes much of its 1990 modification to the Tax Service Agreement.  Instead of adopting the standard language of Hamilton Taft's pre-printed form, stating that the agreement \"may not be assigned to persons who are not employees of Hamilton Taft,\" Stop &amp; Shop revised the clause to provide that the agreement \"may not be assigned by Hamilton Taft.\"   The district court agreed that this change indicated that Stop &amp; Shop intended that no entity other than Hamilton Taft could be the authorized representative.  This conclusion requires reading too much between the lines.  The record contains no evidence of the context in which the contract revision was made, nor gives any clue as to why it was implemented.  We see no relationship between the revision and an understanding of the term \"authorized representative.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hamilton Taft can act only through its officers and employees, and the reality is that the grant of authority to the executives of Hamilton Taft enabled their diversion of funds.  When we consider, too, that employee exclusion clauses have been construed to encompass theft for personal benefit, and that the policy excludes illegal acts by employees, directors or authorized representatives without distinguishing between these groups, the intent of the exclusion is most readily understood as an effort to bar coverage of wrong committed by persons who have been granted access to the corporate funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do public policy concerns play an obvious role here.  The district court, while conceding that the dispute in this case turns wholly on an interpretation of a contract clause and not on an equitable allocation of risk between innocent parties,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> felt vicarious liability-agency law provided useful guidance.  Some Massachusetts cases have found companies liable for the illegal actions of their employees only where the employees act for the companies' benefit rather than for their own.  See Kansallis Finance Ltd. v. Fern, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">659</span></span>, 665-69, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">659</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></span>, 734-37 (1996) (reviewing existing case law).  We do not pursue here the conflict in the case law on this issue, as we disagree with the district court's assessment that these cases provide a useful context for understanding the present situation.  These cases turn on equitable allocation of the financial burden resulting from bad acts by officers or employees.  Where a creditor or third party suffers at the hands of such a person, and the company somehow ratified the improper act or gave its express authority to perpetrate fraud, it makes equitable sense for the company to pay.  It is equally true that where a maverick officer or employee perpetrates fraud against the company's interest and without the company's express or implied knowledge, it may be unfair to hold the company liable.  We are not concerned here with a determination of whether the corporation Hamilton Taft should be liable to a creditor for the wrongful acts of its employees.  It may be that Stop &amp; Shop suffered a loss at the hands of Hamilton Taft employees for which it deserves compensation.  But Stop &amp; Shop's insurer, Federal, who was not party to the fraud, has no responsibility to reimburse for losses suffered unless those losses are contractually covered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If we were to hold, as Stop &amp; Shop's argument would have us do, that an insurance company must bear the full cost of theft only when it was committed by an individual working for the insured company's authorized representative but acting contrary to the representative's interest, the exclusionary clause, insofar as it deals with the authorized representative, wouldn't accomplish much.  The policy underlying the exclusion clause, which includes, without distinction, employees, directors, trustees and authorized representatives, is most readily understood as an effort to place on the insured the risk of picking a faithless agent.  It makes little sense for the exclusion clause to encompass self-interested acts on the part of employees, but not on the part of those working for the authorized representative.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We come full circle, then, to the contract.  The exclusion clause specifically states that the crime insurance policy does not cover theft by an authorized representative.  The policy does not restrict the scope of \"authorized representative\" to acts benefitting Hamilton Taft, the record contains no evidence that such a restriction was contemplated, and no case law applies such a restriction.  In sum, although exclusion clauses are to be narrowly construed, we find no basis for imposing the proposed limit.  In the absence of legally cognizable ambiguity, we enforce the ordinary meaning of the words.  Bird, 11 F.3d at 232.   It is most sensible to consider \"authorized representative\" as one of a series of capacities in which an individual who commits theft may have been given access to funds by the insured.  We see use of the term as a straightforward effort to embrace all statuses that are \"authorized,\" and thus are the insured's responsibility to supervise.  Because Hamilton Taft can act only through its officers, we must construe this exclusion to encompass generally acts by the officers of Hamilton Taft.  As officers of the corporate representative, Armstrong and others were given access and power to divert funds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finding that the diversion of funds by officers of Hamilton Taft falls under Federal's authorized representative exclusion policy, we reverse the district court decision, and need not reach the direct loss and damages questions raised on appeal.  As we find Stop &amp; Shop is not covered under Federal's policy, we deny its cross-appeal for attorney's fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Insuring Clause 2 provides coverage for such loss within or from the premises or banking premises;  insuring clause 3 provides for coverage from such loss \"outside the premises, while being conveyed by the Insured, ... or any other person duly authorized by the Insured to have custody thereof....\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The Bankruptcy Code allows a bankruptcy trustee to:</p>\n        <p>... avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property--</p>\n        <p>(1) to or for the benefit of a creditor;</p>\n        <p>(2) for or on account of an antecedent debt owed by the debtor before such transfer was made;</p>\n        <p>(3) made while the debtor was insolvent;</p>\n        <p>(4) made--</p>\n        <p>(A) on or within 90 days before the date of the filing of the petition ...</p>\n        <p>11 U.S.C. &#167; 547(b).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In Colson, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Rather, the Colson court explored only the definition of the term \"authorized representative\" in an effort to determine whether an investment company that made bad investments for the insured fell under the applicable crime insurance policy's authorized representative exclusion.  Id. at 67.   As the case neither relied on the \"while working or otherwise\" language nor concerned acts by individuals, it does not support Stop &amp; Shop's arguments</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> While Federal and Stop &amp; Shop's dispute concerns application of the term \"authorized representative\" rather than \"employee,\" we agree with Stop &amp; Shop that the way \"employee\" exclusions have been interpreted is instructive as we consider how to construe the scope of the authorized representative exclusion</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Federal seeks to apply the alter ego doctrine in furtherance of its argument;  agreeing with Stop &amp; Shop, the district court found the doctrine inapplicable to this case.  We see no need to ground refusal of coverage in this complex doctrine, which is based on the equitable allocation of liability.  Indeed, to apply it would turn equitable allocation on its head, for it was Stop &amp; Shop, not Federal, whose choice of Hamilton Taft gave Armstrong access to the diverted funds</p>\n        <p>We are not faced here with equitable, public policy concerns about placing responsibility on the guilty, or more culpable, party, nor are we presented with a need to find an extraordinary way to impose liability on a generally untouched party.  This case does not involve a creditor seeking to hold an individual liable for misuse or theft of funds, nor does it seek to guarantee that a wrongdoer company does not recover under an insurance policy for abuse perpetrated by its own officer, director or shareholder.  Hamilton Taft is not a party to this action, and its liability for the misappropriation of funds is not at issue here.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Theft and misappropriation of funds--acts covered by crime insurance policies--are by their very nature most likely to be committed for individual rather than corporate benefit.
