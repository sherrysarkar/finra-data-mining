D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                  Selya, Boudin and Lynch,\r\n\n                      Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Anthony J. Natale, with whom Julie C. Molloy and Pepe &amp; Hazard\r\nLLP were on brief, for appellant.\r\n   Catherine R. Connors, with whom Jared L. Tardy and Pierce\r\nAtwood were on brief, for appellee.\r\n\nJanuary 28, 2000\r\n\nSELYA, Circuit Judge.  After Mauricio Iragorri plummeted\r\ndown an elevator shaft to his death, his widow sued various\r\nentities, including International Elevator, Inc. (IEI), alleging\r\nculpable negligence.  The United States District Court for the\r\nDistrict of Maine dismissed the claim against IEI on forum non\r\nconveniens grounds.  Discerning no abuse of discretion, we affirm.\r\nI.  BACKGROUND\r\nA native of Colombia, Iragorri emigrated to the United\r\nStates with his wife and two young children in the early 1980s. \r\nThe family settled in Florida, and all four became naturalized\r\ncitizens in 1989.  In the fall of 1992, the children, then\r\nteenagers, were participating in an educational exchange program\r\narranged by their Florida high school, and the appellant was living\r\nwith them in Bogota.  Iragorri also was in Colombia.\r\n                      A.  The Accident.\r\nThe following events took place during the early morning\r\nhours of October 3, 1992.  Shortly after 1:00 a.m., Iragorri\r\nentered the Portada del Mar, a partially finished apartment\r\nbuilding in Cali, to visit his mother.  The doorman, Danilo Osorio\r\nGarcia (Osorio), informed him that the elevators were out of order. \r\nIragorri took the stairs to the fifth floor.  The record is\r\ntenebrous concerning his condition; Osorio initially told\r\ninvestigators that Iragorri was inebriated, but later testified\r\nthat he seemed fine.\r\nAbout ten minutes after Iragorri's arrival, Osorio heard\r\na loud noise.  Upon investigation, he claims to have found a\r\nscrewdriver holding open the elevator doors on the fifth floor.  He\r\nthen heard moans emanating from the elevator shaft and discovered\r\nthat Iragorri had plunged to the bottom, sustaining fatal injuries.\r\n                       B.  IEI's Role.\r\nIEI was incorporated in Maine in 1924, as a subsidiary of\r\nOtis Elevator (Otis).  Otis divested itself of its South American\r\ninterests in 1988, spinning off IEI in the process.  From that\r\npoint forward, IEI operated exclusively in South America (although\r\nit retained its Maine charter).  It still distributes and services\r\nOtis elevators.  Although IEI did not install the elevators that\r\nserve the Portada del Mar complex, it did contract to maintain\r\nthem.\r\nRoughly six hours before Iragorri entered the premises,\r\nOsorio called IEI to report that both of the building's elevators\r\nwere out of order.  An IEI employee, Gerardo Ortiz,  responded\r\npromptly and determined that the cable on the left-hand elevator\r\nhad snapped and that the elevator itself was in the basement.  He\r\nproceeded to the fifth floor, opened the elevator doors, and worked\r\non the right-hand elevator.  When he was through, he claims to have\r\nclosed the doors.  He then went to the basement to inspect the\r\ndowned left-hand elevator.  Once there, he concluded that he would\r\nnot be able to complete the repairs that day.  He showed Osorio\r\nwhat was wrong with both elevators and asked Osorio to turn off the\r\npower pending his return.  When questioned by officials, Ortiz\r\ncould not explain how a screwdriver became wedged in the elevator\r\ndoors (if, indeed, that was the case).\r\n                     C.  The Litigation.\r\nMrs. Iragorri brought a wrongful death action against a\r\nnumber of defendants in the United States District Court for the\r\nDistrict of Connecticut.  All the defendants moved to dismiss.  The\r\ncourt retained jurisdiction over the claims against Otis and United\r\nTechnologies (Otis's corporate parent), but determined that IEI\r\nwas not subject to in personam jurisdiction in Connecticut and\r\ntherefore transferred the case against it to Maine.  See 28 U.S.C.\r\n1404(a).  Apart from the fact that IEI had been incorporated in\r\nMaine (and was, therefore, amenable to service there), neither\r\nparty had any significant contacts with that jurisdiction.  When\r\nIEI moved for dismissal in the transferee court, the district judge\r\nreferred the motion to a magistrate judge, see Fed. R. Civ. P.\r\n72(b), who recommended granting it on forum non conveniens grounds. \r\nMrs. Iragorri objected.  The district court, affording de novo\r\nreview, approved the magistrate's report and recommendation.  This\r\nappeal ensued.\r\nII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nApart from errors of law, forum non conveniens\r\ndeterminations \"may be reversed only when there has been a clear\r\nabuse of discretion.\"  Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno, 454 U.S. 235,\r\n257 (1981).  Such an abuse transpires if the nisi prius court (1)\r\nfails to consider a material factor; (2) relies substantially on an\r\nimproper factor; or (3) assesses the appropriate factors but\r\nclearly errs in weighing them, with the result that its assessment\r\nfalls outside the universe of plausible outcomes.  See Nowak v. Tak\r\nHow Invs., Ltd., 94 F.3d 708, 719 (1st Cir. 1996); Mercier v.\r\nSheraton Int'l, Inc., 935 F.2d 419, 423 (1st Cir. 1991) (Mercier\r\nI).  In administering this test, a reviewing court must assiduously\r\navoid twin temptations:  it must neither substitute its judgment\r\nfor that of the district court nor strike the balance of relevant\r\nfactors anew.  See Piper, 454 U.S. at 257.\r\nIII.  DISCUSSION\r\nWhen a defendant moves for dismissal on forum non\r\nconveniens grounds, it bears the burden of showing both that an\r\nadequate alternative forum exists and that considerations of\r\nconvenience and judicial efficiency strongly favor litigating the\r\nclaim in the alternative forum.  See Mercier I, 935 F.2d at 423-24. \r\nCourts generally deem the first requirement satisfied if the\r\ndefendant demonstrates that the alternative forum addresses the\r\ntypes of claims that the plaintiff has brought and that the\r\ndefendant is amenable to service of process there.  See Piper, 454\r\nU.S. at 254 n.22.  The second requirement evokes a more\r\nsophisticated balancing:  the defendant must show that the\r\ncompendium of factors relevant to the private and public interests\r\nimplicated by the case strongly favors dismissal.  See Gulf Oil\r\nCorp. v. Gilbert, 330 U.S. 501, 508-09 (1947); Mercier I, 935 F.2d\r\nat 423-24.\r\nThe Supreme Court has provided substantial guidance on\r\nthe nature of the factors to be assayed in the second step of the\r\nanalysis.  Considerations relevant to the litigants' private\r\ninterests include \"the relative ease of access to sources of proof;\r\navailability of compulsory process for attendance of unwilling, and\r\nthe cost of obtaining attendance of willing, witnesses; [and the]\r\npossibility of view of premises, if view would be appropriate to\r\nthe action.\"  Gilbert, 330 U.S. at 508.  Evaluating private\r\ninterests also requires the trial judge to pay heed to \"all other\r\npractical problems that make trial of a case easy, expeditious and\r\ninexpensive.\"  Id.  We have no doubt that the flip side of this\r\ncoin has equal pertinence; the judge must consider those factors\r\nthat threaten to make trial more cumbersome, prolong it, or drive\r\nup costs.  Factors relevant to the public interest include such\r\nthings as the administrative difficulties of docket congestion; the\r\ngeneral goal of \"having localized controversies decided at home,\"\r\nand concomitantly, ease of access to the proceedings on the part of\r\ninterested citizens; the trier's relative familiarity with the\r\nappropriate rules of decision; and the burdens of jury duty.  Id.\r\nat 508-09.\r\nIn all events, as to both private and public interests,\r\nflexibility is the watchword.  See Piper, 454 U.S. at 249-50.  The\r\ncompendia provided by the Court comprise a helpful starting point,\r\nbut not every item applies in every case and, in the last analysis,\r\nthe list of factors is illustrative rather than all-inclusive. \r\n\"[T]he ultimate inquiry is where trial will best serve the\r\nconvenience of the parties and the ends of justice.\"  Koster v.\r\n(American)Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., 330 U.S. 518, 527 (1947).\r\nWith this brief preface, we test the district court's\r\ndecision against the two-step framework.\r\n               A.  Adequate Alternative Forum.\r\nIn considering a forum non conveniens claim, an inquiring\r\ncourt should begin by determining the existence vel non of an\r\nadequate alternative forum for the prosecution of the action.  The\r\ncourt below impliedly concluded that Colombia constitutes such a\r\nforum.  The appellant assails this conclusion on two bases.\r\nAs an initial matter, the appellant complains that the\r\ndistrict court failed to afford due consideration to her family's\r\napprehensions anent their personal safety should they be forced to\r\nlitigate in Colombia.  In her view, the attendant dangers, as\r\nevidenced by the State Department's advisory against unnecessary\r\ntravel (especially to Cali), make Colombia an inadequate or\r\nunavailable alternative to the United States for the purpose of\r\nlitigating her claim.\r\nThe district court explored this argument at some\r\nlength.  In the end, it found no particularized evidence that\r\ntravel to Colombia would imperil the Iragorris, and, relatedly,\r\nfound much evidence that they would be able to negotiate the\r\ncountry more easily than ordinary American visitors.  These\r\nfactors, the court concluded, neutralized the force of the State\r\nDepartment's warning.  We cannot term this judgment unreasonable.\r\nThere are, of course, cases in which courts have\r\ndiscussed the possibility that the dangers inherent in traveling to\r\na proposed forum might make litigation there a practical\r\nimpossibility (and, thus, no real alternative).  See, e.g.,\r\nRasoulzadeh v. Associated Press, 574 F. Supp. 854, 861 (S.D.N.Y.\r\n1983), aff'd, 767 F.2d 908 (2d Cir. 1985).  But see Guidi v. Inter-\r\nContinental Hotels Corp., No. 95 CIV. 9006 LAP, 1999 WL 228360, at\r\n*3-4 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 20, 1999) (limiting Rasoulzadeh to cases in\r\nwhich danger implicates the plaintiff's access to the alternate\r\njustice system).  Nevertheless, it is the trial judge who best\r\nappreciates the case's nuances and the parties' circumstances, and\r\nthe appellant points to no case in which an appellate tribunal has\r\nfound overarching danger despite a trial court finding that the\r\nproposed forum constituted a viable alternative.  The record\r\nreflects no basis to make this case the first.\r\nIn a nimble attempt to sidestep this reality, the\r\nappellant lodges a claim of legal error:  she asseverates that\r\ncertain of the items cited by the district court as evidence that\r\nColombia's dangers were less inhibitory to her and her children  \r\ne.g., their previous Colombian citizenship, their residence in\r\nColombia in 1991 and 1992, their family ties (the record mentions\r\nclose relatives on both sides of the family who live in Colombia),\r\nthe children's tenure as exchange students, and their conversance\r\nwith the Spanish language   were improperly factored into the\r\nequation.  We do not agree.  A plaintiff's familiarity with the\r\nalternative forum, her comfort level there, and her fluency in the\r\nlanguage used in its courts may be weighed in deciding a forum non\r\nconvenience motion.  See Royal Bed &amp; Spring Co. v. Famossul\r\nIndustria E Comercio de Moveis Ltda., 906 F.2d 45, 52-53 (1st Cir.\r\n1990); see also Marc O. Wolinsky, Comment, Forum Non Conveniens and\r\nAmerican Plaintiffs in the Federal Courts, 47 U. Chi. L. Rev. 373,\r\n382-83 (1980) (positing that American citizenship is a factor in\r\nfavor of plaintiffs' convenience only insofar as it is a proxy for\r\n\"geography, language barriers, and unfamiliarity with foreign\r\nsystems\") (cited with approval in Piper, 454 U.S. at 256 n.24). \r\nAlthough these factors more often relate to the second-stage\r\nbalancing, we believe that in light of the appellant's contention\r\nthat she and her children could not safely travel to Colombia, the\r\ncourt reasonably deemed them relevant to the suitability of the\r\nproposed alternative forum.  It follows that, on the peculiar facts\r\nof this case, the district court did not commit an abuse of\r\ndiscretion in assigning diminished weight to the State Department's\r\nadvisory.\r\nThe second strand of the appellant's argument derives\r\nfrom a footnote in which the Piper Court stated that if \"the remedy\r\noffered by the other forum is clearly unsatisfactory, the other\r\nforum may not be an adequate alternative.\"  454 U.S. at 254 n.22. \r\nUsing footnote 22 as a springboard, the appellant asserts that the\r\nlack of an adequate remedy under Colombian law renders a Colombian\r\nforum inconcinnous for purposes of this case.  Refined to bare\r\nessence, this assertion boils down to a claim that the Colombian\r\nSupreme Court occasionally has limited damages for pain and\r\nsuffering in wrongful death actions (called \"moral damages\" there)\r\nto amounts that seem paltry when converted into United States\r\ndollars.\r\nThe lower court's weighing of the proof on this point\r\nwithstands scrutiny.  The court found no credible evidence of an\r\nartificial ceiling on provable economic loss applicable to wrongful\r\ndeath actions brought in Colombia and, relatedly, found no credible\r\nevidence to support the appellant's suggestion that a lid of some\r\nsort applies generally in such cases.  At worst, a plaintiff forced\r\nto litigate a wrongful death action in Colombia rather than in an\r\nAmerican jurisdiction faces a downgrade in remedy, i.e., an\r\ninstitutional inhospitability to generous awards for non-economic\r\nlosses.  This circumstance, in and of itself, does not impugn the\r\nadequacy of the proposed alternative forum.  See, e.g., id. at 255\r\n(holding that the unavailability of a cause of action for strict\r\nliability does not render the alternate forum inadequate); Ahmed v.\r\nBoeing Co., 720 F.2d 224, 226 (1st Cir. 1983) (stating that the\r\nunsatisfactory remedy exception applies only \"where transfer to a\r\nforeign forum means application of a substantive law that is both\r\ndifferent and basically unjust\").\r\nWe need not tarry.  Here, the district court supportably\r\nfound that the Colombian courts entertain wrongful death actions,\r\nthat they grant both pecuniary and moral damages in such suits,\r\nthat the statute of limitations had not expired in Colombia, and\r\nthat IEI was amenable to service of process there.  It also found\r\nthe appellant's evidence of unfavorable changes in the law to be\r\nweak, disputed, and ultimately unconvincing.  No more is exigible\r\nto sustain the court's determination that an adequate alternative\r\nforum exists.  Cf. Piper, 454 U.S. at 254 n.22 (predicting that\r\nfootnote 22 would come into play only \"[i]n rare circumstances\"). \r\n              B.  Private and Public Interests.\r\nHaving verified the district court's implicit conclusion\r\nthat an adequate alternative forum exists, we turn to the second\r\nstage of the inquiry.  Before reaching the merits, however, we must\r\naddress a threshold matter.\r\nThe second-stage inquiry, as we have said, directs the\r\ntrial court to balance an array of factors relevant to both private\r\nand public interests, and to ascertain whether that balance\r\njustifies dismissal.  The usual formulation of the rule of\r\ndecision, adopted by the district court, focuses on the defendant's\r\nability to prove that the result of the balancing \"strongly\r\nfavor[s]\" the alternative forum.  Mercier I, 935 F.2d at 423-24. \r\nThe appellant challenges this formulation and suggests that a trial\r\ncourt should not dismiss for forum non conveniens \"except upon a\r\nclear showing of facts\" that makes the plaintiff's preferred forum\r\ninappropriate because they \"establish such oppressiveness and\r\nvexation to a defendant as to be out of all proportion to\r\nplaintiff's convenience.\"  Koster, 330 U.S. at 524 (dictum).\r\nIn our view, the lower court's decision demonstrates an\r\nawareness of the appropriate legal standards for forum non\r\nconveniens analysis.  The Koster Court's use of the term\r\n\"oppressiveness and vexation\" neither created an independent\r\nstandard nor raised the bar for dismissal in forum non conveniens\r\ncases.  See Alcoa S.S. Co. v. M/V Nordic Regent, 654 F.2d 147, 151-\r\n52 (2d Cir. 1980) (en banc); Pain v. United Techs. Corp., 637 F.2d\r\n775, 783 (D.C. Cir. 1980); cf. Lacey v. Cessna Aircraft Co., 862\r\nF.2d 38, 42, 44 (3d Cir. 1988) (quoting Koster and then summarizing\r\nthe applicable standard as imposing a burden to show that the\r\naggregate of relevant factors \"weigh[s] heavily on the side of\r\ndismissal\").  Lower courts often must tease a standard from a\r\nplethora of phrases that collectively describe a legal principle,\r\nand the court below correctly divined that, at the second stage of\r\nthe inquiry, a defendant's right to obtain a dismissal on forum non\r\nconveniens grounds hinges on whether it can show that\r\nconsiderations of convenience and judicial efficiency strongly\r\nfavor the proposed alterative forum.  After all, the \"strongly\r\nfavors\" language has deep roots in Supreme Court precedent, see\r\nGilbert, 330 U.S. at 508, and the Court's subsequent mentions of\r\nthe Koster dictum lend no support to the notion that the dictum\r\nsomehow supplanted the \"strongly favors\" test.  See, e.g., Norwood\r\nv. Kirkpatrick, 349 U.S. 29, 35 (1955).  This court heretofore has\r\nused the \"strongly favors\" standard as a distillation of the\r\n\"oppressiveness and vexation\" language, see Mercier I, 935 F.2d at\r\n423-24, and we continue to believe that this is the proper\r\nperspective.\r\nThis brings us to the balancing of the relevant private\r\nand public interests.  We start by acknowledging the thoroughness\r\nof the district court's canvass; it thoughtfully discussed all the\r\npertinent factors cited by the parties and reacted to each item. \r\nOn a more global note, the court explained why convenience,\r\nefficiency, and fairness all militated in favor of a trial in\r\nColombia.  It emphasized that the accident had occurred there and\r\nthat Ortiz and Osorio   the two principal witnesses on liability  \r\nwould play leading roles at trial.  The court remarked the need to\r\ngauge these witnesses' credibility and stressed the salience of\r\ndemeanor evidence in that endeavor.  It then observed that neither\r\nwitness could be compelled to attend a trial in Maine and that, in\r\nany event, both men were Spanish speakers.  In addition, the court\r\nnoted that, should the case proceed in Maine, IEI would be unable\r\nto implead other potentially responsible parties, that it would be\r\nimpossible to conduct a view, and that unfamiliar law would supply\r\nthe substantive rules of decision.  Considering these and other\r\nfactors, the court determined that the balance of private and\r\npublic interests strongly favored recourse to a Colombian forum.\r\nThe appellant's attack on this determination occurs on\r\nseveral fronts.  First, she declares that the court gave lip\r\nservice to, but did not enforce, IEI's burden of proof.  In an\r\neffort to document this ipse dixit, she asserts that the court\r\nexpressed some ambivalence, stating at one point that \"neither\r\nforum alternative in this case is particularly satisfactory,\" yet\r\nnonetheless granted IEI's motion to dismiss.\r\nWe do not think that this allusion undermines the\r\ndistrict court's ruling.  First, the quoted statement is not\r\nnecessarily at odds with the use of the correct standard.  See\r\ninfra at 16-18.  Second, since other references in the decision\r\nmake it plain that the court fully understood the operative legal\r\nprinciples, even an infelicitous choice of phrase would not warrant\r\nreversal.  See Lenn v. Portland Sch. Comm, 998 F.2d 1083, 1087-88\r\n(1st Cir. 1993); Clauson v. Smith, 823 F.2d 660, 663 n.3 (1st Cir.\r\n1987); United States v. Kobrosky, 711 F.2d 449, 456 (1st Cir.\r\n1983).  The lower court's rescript makes pellucid its awareness of\r\nthe correct burden of proof, and it reached a result that was\r\nentirely consonant with that burden.  In such circumstances, we\r\ndecline to presume that the court said one thing and did another. \r\nThe appellant next asserts that the district court failed\r\nto consider the public interest that attaches to resolving a\r\nwrongful death action brought by United States citizens in a\r\nfederal court.  Here, too, her argument borders on the\r\nmetaphysical.  The district court mentioned the tenet that a United\r\nStates court has a particular interest in an action brought by a\r\ncitizen, see Mercier I, 935 F.2d at 429-30, and proceeded to weigh\r\nthe appellant's, her children's, and her decedent's citizenship in\r\nthe balance.  The court also noted, however, that a plaintiff's\r\nlack of relationship to the forum state may diminish the ultimate\r\ninfluence of this interest.  This countervailing consideration was\r\nproperly added to the mix both as a matter of legal theory, see\r\nMercier v. Sheraton Int'l, Inc., 981 F.2d 1345, 1355 (1st Cir.\r\n1992) (Mercier II), and as a matter of fact (given Maine's tenuous\r\nrelationship to the case).  Thus, the appellant's plaint, stripped\r\nof rhetorical flourishes, is less that the district court\r\noverlooked a factor and more that the court chose to synthesize\r\nseveral related factors.  We see no abuse of discretion in the\r\ncourt's handling of this aspect of the case.\r\nThe appellant also maintains that the district court\r\noveremphasized the importance of the testimony to be given by Ortiz\r\nand Osorio, and impermissibly discounted the witnesses that she\r\nplanned to call (who, she said, would refuse to appear in Colombia\r\nbecause of incipient danger there).  Once again, the court\r\nexplicitly addressed these concerns.  It recognized that trial in\r\nColombia likely would dissuade certain witnesses from appearing in\r\nperson, but found that the problems of proof would be exacerbated,\r\nnot ameliorated, by a trial in Maine (where crucial liability\r\nwitnesses whose credibility was under attack most likely would\r\nappear, if at all, by video deposition with the assistance of a\r\ntranslator).  In the court's view, the language barrier would\r\nprevent an American jury from evaluating their credibility\r\neffectively.  The appellant's suggested witnesses were experts,\r\nconcerned primarily with damages, and the court decided that their\r\ntestimony would be more amenable to depositions and translation\r\n(if, indeed, local experts could not be retained).\r\nThis is a judgment call, pure and simple, and illustrates\r\nthe wisdom of granting the district court a margin of discretion in\r\nthe area of forum non conveniens.  The trial judge is in the best\r\nposition to know the interstices of any particular case and to\r\nevaluate both the parties' interests and the likely efficacy of the\r\ntruth-finding process.  See Gilbert, 330 U.S. at 508.  Given the\r\nstandard of review, it is not within our proper purview to disturb\r\na trial court's reasoned, record-rooted determination that justice\r\ncould be done more perfectly in a foreign forum than in an American\r\njurisdiction because of the relative ease of communicating the most\r\nimportant (and the most controversial) testimony to the factfinder.\r\nThe case law supports such a result.  For one thing, the\r\nfacts as found by the district court closely parallel the situation\r\nin Piper, 454 U.S. at 257-58 (upholding a trial court determination\r\nthat in spite of \"private interests point[ing] in both directions\r\n. . . fewer evidentiary problems would be posed if the trial were\r\nheld in Scotland\").  For another thing, we have emphasized in an\r\nanalogous context that \"the live testimony of [key] witnesses for\r\nthe purposes of presenting demeanor evidence [is] essential to a\r\nfair trial.\"  Howe v. Goldcorp Invs., Ltd., 946 F.2d 944, 952 (1st\r\nCir. 1991).  Indeed, on one occasion we approved a determination\r\nthat because a particular witness's \"credibility would be pivotal\r\nto any judicial resolution of the factual issues at the root of the\r\nparties' dispute . . . deposition testimony and letters rogatory,\r\neven if available to the American court, would be less than\r\nsatisfactory substitutes for in-person testimony.\"  Mercier II, 981\r\nF.2d at 1356.  Finally, the Court has suggested that the\r\navailability of expert witnesses may not be as significant as the\r\navailability of fact witnesses.  See Gilbert, 330 U.S. at 509. \r\nGiven these authorities, we are unprepared to hold that the\r\ndistrict court misused its discretion by dismissing the action in\r\nfavor of an imperfect, but nonetheless highly preferable, forum.\r\nAs her parting shot, the appellant laments the district\r\ncourt's finding that her financial position was irrelevant to its\r\ndecision.  This jeremiad misconstrues the situation.  In Mercier\r\nII, we affirmed a finding that an alternate forum was adequate in\r\nspite of economic impositions on the plaintiffs, noting that the\r\nplaintiffs were not indigent and that inquiry into their financial\r\ncapability to bring suit in the proposed alternate forum did not\r\nreveal any insuperable obstacles.  See 981 F.2d at 1353.  On\r\nappeal, the appellant, unlike in Mercier II, raises the\r\nimpecuniousness argument not in terms of the adequacy of the\r\nalternate forum, but, rather, in terms of the balance of\r\nconvenience.  We agree with her underlying premise:  at the second\r\nstage of a forum non conveniens analysis, financial hardships may\r\nbe relevant.  Moreover, even if such a hardship does not make\r\nforeign litigation impossible, it nonetheless may constitute one of\r\nthe \"practical problems\" that help to determine whether trial of a\r\ncase in a given venue will (or will not) be convenient.  Gilbert,\r\n330 U.S. at 508.  That said, this avenue of inquiry proves a dead-\r\nend for Mrs. Iragorri.\r\nThe mere suggestion of greater financial strain is\r\nmeaningless unless and until the plaintiff demonstrates the nature\r\nand extent of the supposed limitations upon her ability to\r\nlitigate.  Here, the appellant wholly failed to adduce any evidence\r\nof her financial resources (or the lack thereof).  It is hornbook\r\nlaw that an appellate argument cannot survive the proponent's\r\nfailure to supply a sufficient factual predicate for it.  See,\r\ne.g., Casa Marie Hogar Geriatrico, Inc. v. Rivera Santos, 38 F.3d\r\n615, 618 n.2 (1st Cir. 1994); United States v. Slade, 980 F.2d 27,\r\n30 (1st Cir. 1992).  So it is here.\r\nWe need go no further.  The appellant has advanced a\r\ngolconda of arguments in an effort to persuade us that the decision\r\nto dismiss the case on forum non conveniens grounds represented an\r\nabuse of discretion.  Even given the presumption in favor of the\r\nplaintiff's choice of forum, see Nowak, 94 F.3d at 270   a\r\npresumption that the district court acknowledged and to which it\r\npaid obeisance   none of these arguments is convincing.  That we,\r\nif writing on a pristine page, might have resolved the decisional\r\ncalculus differently is of no moment.  As the Supreme Court has\r\nwritten, \"where the [trial] court has considered all relevant\r\npublic and private interest factors, and where its balancing of\r\nthese factors is reasonable, its decision deserves substantial\r\ndeference.\"  Piper, 454 U.S. at 257.\r\n\nAffirmed.\n",

(IEI), alleging culpable negligence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The United States District Court for the District of Maine dismissed the claim against IEI on forum non conveniens grounds. Discerning no abuse of discretion, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A native of Colombia, Iragorri emigrated to the United States with his wife and two young children in the early 1980s. The family settled in Florida, and all four became naturalized citizens in 1989. In the fall of 1992, the children, then teenagers, were participating in an educational exchange program arranged by their Florida high school, and the appellant was living with them in Bogota. Iragorri also was in Colombia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. The Accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following events took place during the early morning hours of October 3, 1992. Shortly after 1:00 a.m., Iragorri entered the Portada del Mar, a partially finished apartment building in Cali, to visit his mother. The doorman, Danilo Osorio Garcia (Osorio), informed him that the elevators were out of order. Iragorri took the stairs to the fifth floor. The record is tenebrous concerning his condition; Osorio initially told investigators that Iragorri was inebriated, but later testified that he seemed fine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About ten minutes after Iragorri's arrival, Osorio heard a loud noise. Upon investigation, he claims to have found a screwdriver holding open the elevator doors on the fifth floor. He then heard moans emanating from the elevator shaft and discovered that Iragorri had plunged to the bottom, sustaining fatal injuries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. IEI's Role.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IEI was incorporated in Maine in 1924, as a subsidiary of Otis Elevator (Otis). Otis divested itself of its South American interests in 1988, spinning off IEI in the process. From that point forward, IEI operated exclusively in South America (although it retained its Maine charter). It still distributes and services Otis elevators. Although IEI did not install the elevators that serve the Portada del Mar complex, it did contract to maintain them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roughly six hours before Iragorri entered the premises, Osorio called IEI to report that both of the building's elevators were out of order. An IEI employee, Gerardo Ortiz, responded promptly and determined that the cable on the left-hand elevator had snapped and that the elevator itself was in the basement. He proceeded to the fifth floor, opened the elevator doors, and worked on the right-hand elevator. When he was through, he claims to have closed the doors. He then went to the basement to inspect the downed left-hand elevator. Once there, he concluded that he would not be able to complete the repairs that day. He showed Osorio what was wrong with both elevators and asked Osorio to turn off the power pending his return. When questioned by officials, Ortiz could not explain how a screwdriver became wedged in the elevator doors (if, indeed, that was the case).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. The Litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mrs. Iragorri brought a wrongful death action against a number of defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. All the defendants moved to dismiss. The court retained jurisdiction over the claims against Otis and United Technologies (Otis's corporate parent),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> but determined that IEI was not subject to in personam jurisdiction in Connecticut and therefore transferred the case against it to Maine. See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1404(a). Apart from the fact that IEI had been incorporated in Maine (and was, therefore, amenable to service there), neither party had any significant contacts with that jurisdiction. When IEI moved for dismissal in the transferee court, the district judge referred the motion to a magistrate judge, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b), who recommended granting it on forum non conveniens grounds. Mrs. Iragorri objected. The district court, affording de novo review, approved the magistrate's report and recommendation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apart from errors of law, forum non conveniens determinations \"may be reversed only when there has been a clear abuse of discretion.\" Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno, 454 U.S. 235, 257 (1981). Such an abuse transpires if the nisi prius court (1) fails to consider a material factor; (2) relies substantially on an improper factor; or (3) assesses the appropriate factors but clearly errs in weighing them, with the result that its assessment falls outside the universe of plausible outcomes. See Nowak v. Tak How Invs., Ltd., 94 F.3d 708, 719 (1st Cir. 1996); Mercier v. Sheraton Int'l, Inc., 935 F.2d 419, 423 (1st Cir. 1991) (Mercier I). In administering this test, a reviewing court must assiduously avoid twin temptations: it must neither substitute its judgment for that of the district court nor strike the balance of relevant factors anew. See Piper, 454 U.S. at 257.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a defendant moves for dismissal on forum non conveniens grounds, it bears the burden of showing both that an adequate alternative forum exists and that considerations of convenience and judicial efficiency strongly favor litigating the claim in the alternative forum. See Mercier I, 935 F.2d at 423-24. Courts generally deem the first requirement satisfied if the defendant demonstrates that the alternative forum addresses the types of claims that the plaintiff has brought and that the defendant is amenable to service of process there. See Piper, 454 U.S. at 254 n.22. The second requirement evokes a more sophisticated balancing: the defendant must show that the compendium of factors relevant to the private and public interests implicated by the case strongly favors dismissal. See Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, 330 U.S. 501, 508-09 (1947); Mercier I, 935 F.2d at 423-24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has provided substantial guidance on the nature of the factors to be assayed in the second step of the analysis. Considerations relevant to the litigants' private interests include \"the relative ease of access to sources of proof; availability of compulsory process for attendance of unwilling, and the cost of obtaining attendance of willing, witnesses; [and the] possibility of view of premises, if view would be appropriate to the action.\" Gilbert, 330 U.S. at 508. Evaluating private interests also requires the trial judge to pay heed to \"all other practical problems that make trial of a case easy, expeditious and inexpensive.\" Id. We have no doubt that the flip side of this coin has equal pertinence; the judge must consider those factors that threaten to make trial more cumbersome, prolong it, or drive up costs. Factors relevant to the public interest include such things as the administrative difficulties of docket congestion; the general goal of \"having localized controversies decided at home,\" and concomitantly, ease of access to the proceedings on the part of interested citizens; the trier's relative familiarity with the appropriate rules of decision; and the burdens of jury duty. Id. at 508-09.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, as to both private and public interests, flexibility is the watchword. See Piper, 454 U.S. at 249-50. The compendia provided by the Court comprise a helpful starting point, but not every item applies in every case and, in the last analysis, the list of factors is illustrative rather than all-inclusive. \"[T]he ultimate inquiry is where trial will best serve the convenience of the parties and the ends of justice.\" Koster v. (American)Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., 330 U.S. 518, 527 (1947).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With this brief preface, we test the district court's decision against the two-step framework.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Adequate Alternative Forum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In considering a forum non conveniens claim, an inquiring court should begin by determining the existence vel non of an adequate alternative forum for the prosecution of the action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The court below impliedly concluded that Colombia constitutes such a forum. The appellant assails this conclusion on two bases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an initial matter, the appellant complains that the district court failed to afford due consideration to her family's apprehensions anent their personal safety should they be forced to litigate in Colombia. In her view, the attendant dangers, as evidenced by the State Department's advisory against unnecessary travel (especially to Cali), make Colombia an inadequate or unavailable alternative to the United States for the purpose of litigating her claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court explored this argument at some length.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> In the end, it found no particularized evidence that travel to Colombia would imperil the Iragorris, and, relatedly, found much evidence that they would be able to negotiate the country more easily than ordinary American visitors. These factors, the court concluded, neutralized the force of the State Department's warning. We cannot term this judgment unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are, of course, cases in which courts have discussed the possibility that the dangers inherent in traveling to a proposed forum might make litigation there a practical impossibility (and, thus, no real alternative). See, e.g., Rasoulzadeh v. Associated Press, 574 F. Supp. 854, 861 (S.D.N.Y. 1983), aff'd, 767 F.2d 908 (2d Cir. 1985). But see Guidi v. Inter-Continental Hotels Corp., No. 95 CIV. 9006 LAP, 1999 WL 228360, at *3-4 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 20, 1999) (limiting Rasoulzadeh to cases in which danger implicates the plaintiff's access to the alternate justice system). Nevertheless, it is the trial judge who best appreciates the case's nuances and the parties' circumstances, and the appellant points to no case in which an appellate tribunal has found overarching danger despite a trial court finding that the proposed forum constituted a viable alternative. The record reflects no basis to make this case the first.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a nimble attempt to sidestep this reality, the appellant lodges a claim of legal error: she asseverates that certain of the items cited by the district court as evidence that Colombia's dangers were less inhibitory to her and her children -- e.g., their previous Colombian citizenship, their residence in Colombia in 1991 and 1992, their family ties (the record mentions close relatives on both sides of the family who live in Colombia), the children's tenure as exchange students, and their conversance with the Spanish language -- were improperly factored into the equation. We do not agree. A plaintiff's familiarity with the alternative forum, her comfort level there, and her fluency in the language used in its courts may be weighed in deciding a forum non convenience motion. See Royal Bed &amp; Spring Co. v. Famossul Industria E Comercio de Moveis Ltda., 906 F.2d 45, 52-53 (1st Cir. 1990); see also Marc O. Wolinsky, Comment, Forum Non Conveniens and American Plaintiffs in the Federal Courts, 47 U. Chi. L. Rev. 373, 382-83 (1980) (positing that American citizenship is a factor in favor of plaintiffs' convenience only insofar as it is a proxy for \"geography, language barriers, and unfamiliarity with foreign systems\") (cited with approval in Piper, 454 U.S. at 256 n.24). Although these factors more often relate to the second-stage balancing, we believe that in light of the appellant's contention that she and her children could not safely travel to Colombia, the court reasonably deemed them relevant to the suitability of the proposed alternative forum. It follows that, on the peculiar facts of this case, the district court did not commit an abuse of discretion in assigning diminished weight to the State Department's advisory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second strand of the appellant's argument derives from a footnote in which the Piper Court stated that if \"the remedy offered by the other forum is clearly unsatisfactory, the other forum may not be an adequate alternative.\" 454 U.S. at 254 n.22. Using footnote 22 as a springboard, the appellant asserts that the lack of an adequate remedy under Colombian law renders a Colombian forum inconcinnous for purposes of this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Refined to bare essence, this assertion boils down to a claim that the Colombian Supreme Court occasionally has limited damages for pain and suffering in wrongful death actions (called \"moral damages\" there) to amounts that seem paltry when converted into United States dollars.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lower court's weighing of the proof on this point withstands scrutiny. The court found no credible evidence of an artificial ceiling on provable economic loss applicable to wrongful death actions brought in Colombia and, relatedly, found no credible evidence to support the appellant's suggestion that a lid of some sort applies generally in such cases. At worst, a plaintiff forced to litigate a wrongful death action in Colombia rather than in an American jurisdiction faces a downgrade in remedy, i.e., an institutional inhospitability to generous awards for non-economic losses. This circumstance, in and of itself, does not impugn the adequacy of the proposed alternative forum. See, e.g., id. at 255 (holding that the unavailability of a cause of action for strict liability does not render the alternate forum inadequate); Ahmed v. Boeing Co., 720 F.2d 224, 226 (1st Cir. 1983) (stating that the unsatisfactory remedy exception applies only \"where transfer to a foreign forum means application of a substantive law that is both different and basically unjust\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not tarry. Here, the district court supportably found that the Colombian courts entertain wrongful death actions, that they grant both pecuniary and moral damages in such suits, that the statute of limitations had not expired in Colombia, and that IEI was amenable to service of process there. It also found the appellant's evidence of unfavorable changes in the law to be weak, disputed, and ultimately unconvincing. No more is exigible to sustain the court's determination that an adequate alternative forum exists. Cf. Piper, 454 U.S. at 254 n.22 (predicting that footnote 22 would come into play only \"[i]n rare circumstances\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Private and Public Interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having verified the district court's implicit conclusion that an adequate alternative forum exists, we turn to the second stage of the inquiry. Before reaching the merits, however, we must address a threshold matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second-stage inquiry, as we have said, directs the trial court to balance an array of factors relevant to both private and public interests, and to ascertain whether that balance justifies dismissal. The usual formulation of the rule of decision, adopted by the district court, focuses on the defendant's ability to prove that the result of the balancing \"strongly favor[s]\" the alternative forum. Mercier I, 935 F.2d at 423-24. The appellant challenges this formulation and suggests that a trial court should not dismiss for forum non conveniens \"except upon a clear showing of facts\" that makes the plaintiff's preferred forum inappropriate because they \"establish such oppressiveness and vexation to a defendant as to be out of all proportion to plaintiff's convenience.\" Koster, 330 U.S. at 524 (dictum).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, the lower court's decision demonstrates an awareness of the appropriate legal standards for forum non conveniens analysis. The Koster Court's use of the term \"oppressiveness and vexation\" neither created an independent standard nor raised the bar for dismissal in forum non conveniens cases. See Alcoa S.S. Co. v. M/V Nordic Regent, 654 F.2d 147, 151-52 (2d Cir. 1980) (en banc); Pain v. United Techs. Corp., 637 F.2d 775, 783 (D.C. Cir. 1980); cf. Lacey v. Cessna Aircraft Co., 862 F.2d 38, 42, 44 (3d Cir. 1988) (quoting Koster and then summarizing the applicable standard as imposing a burden to show that the aggregate of relevant factors \"weigh[s] heavily on the side of dismissal\"). Lower courts often must tease a standard from a plethora of phrases that collectively describe a legal principle, and the court below correctly divined that, at the second stage of the inquiry, a defendant's right to obtain a dismissal on forum non conveniens grounds hinges on whether it can show that considerations of convenience and judicial efficiency strongly favor the proposed alterative forum. After all, the \"strongly favors\" language has deep roots in Supreme Court precedent, see Gilbert, 330 U.S. at 508, and the Court's subsequent mentions of the Koster dictum lend no support to the notion that the dictum somehow supplanted the \"strongly favors\" test. See, e.g., Norwood v. Kirkpatrick, 349 U.S. 29, 35 (1955). This court heretofore has used the \"strongly favors\" standard as a distillation of the \"oppressiveness and vexation\" language, see Mercier I, 935 F.2d at 423-24, and we continue to believe that this is the proper perspective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the balancing of the relevant private and public interests. We start by acknowledging the thoroughness of the district court's canvass; it thoughtfully discussed all the pertinent factors cited by the parties and reacted to each item. On a more global note, the court explained why convenience, efficiency, and fairness all militated in favor of a trial in Colombia. It emphasized that the accident had occurred there and that Ortiz and Osorio -- the two principal witnesses on liability -- would play leading roles at trial. The court remarked the need to gauge these witnesses' credibility and stressed the salience of demeanor evidence in that endeavor. It then observed that neither witness could be compelled to attend a trial in Maine and that, in any event, both men were Spanish speakers. In addition, the court noted that, should the case proceed in Maine, IEI would be unable to implead other potentially responsible parties, that it would be impossible to conduct a view, and that unfamiliar law would supply the substantive rules of decision. Considering these and other factors, the court determined that the balance of private and public interests strongly favored recourse to a Colombian forum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's attack on this determination occurs on several fronts. First, she declares that the court gave lip service to, but did not enforce, IEI's burden of proof. In an effort to document this ipse dixit, she asserts that the court expressed some ambivalence, stating at one point that \"neither forum alternative in this case is particularly satisfactory,\" yet nonetheless granted IEI's motion to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not think that this allusion undermines the district court's ruling. First, the quoted statement is not necessarily at odds with the use of the correct standard. See infra at 16-17. Second, since other references in the decision make it plain that the court fully understood the operative legal principles, even an infelicitous choice of phrase would not warrant reversal. See Lenn v. Portland Sch. Comm, 998 F.2d 1083, 1087-88 (1st Cir. 1993); Clauson v. Smith, 823 F.2d 660, 663 n.3 (1st Cir. 1987); United States v. Kobrosky, 711 F.2d 449, 456 (1st Cir. 1983). The lower court's rescript makes pellucid its awareness of the correct burden of proof, and it reached a result that was entirely consonant with that burden. In such circumstances, we decline to presume that the court said one thing and did another.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant next asserts that the district court failed to consider the public interest that attaches to resolving a wrongful death action brought by United States citizens in a federal court. Here, too, her argument borders on the metaphysical. The district court mentioned the tenet that a United States court has a particular interest in an action brought by a citizen, see Mercier I, 935 F.2d at 429-30, and proceeded to weigh the appellant's, her children's, and her decedent's citizenship in the balance. The court also noted, however, that a plaintiff's lack of relationship to the forum state may diminish the ultimate influence of this interest. This countervailing consideration was properly added to the mix both as a matter of legal theory, see Mercier v. Sheraton Int'l, Inc., 981 F.2d 1345, 1355 (1st Cir. 1992) (Mercier II), and as a matter of fact (given Maine's tenuous relationship to the case). Thus, the appellant's plaint, stripped of rhetorical flourishes, is less that the district court overlooked a factor and more that the court chose to synthesize several related factors. We see no abuse of discretion in the court's handling of this aspect of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant also maintains that the district court overemphasized the importance of the testimony to be given by Ortiz and Osorio, and impermissibly discounted the witnesses that she planned to call (who, she said, would refuse to appear in Colombia because of incipient danger there). Once again, the court explicitly addressed these concerns. It recognized that trial in Colombia likely would dissuade certain witnesses from appearing in person, but found that the problems of proof would be exacerbated, not ameliorated, by a trial in Maine (where crucial liability witnesses whose credibility was under attack most likely would appear, if at all, by video deposition with the assistance of a translator). In the court's view, the language barrier would prevent an American jury from evaluating their credibility effectively. The appellant's suggested witnesses were experts, concerned primarily with damages, and the court decided that their testimony would be more amenable to depositions and translation (if, indeed, local experts could not be retained).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a judgment call, pure and simple, and illustrates the wisdom of granting the district court a margin of discretion in the area of forum non conveniens. The trial judge is in the best position to know the interstices of any particular case and to evaluate both the parties' interests and the likely efficacy of the truth-finding process. See Gilbert, 330 U.S. at 508. Given the standard of review, it is not within our proper purview to disturb a trial court's reasoned, record-rooted determination that justice could be done more perfectly in a foreign forum than in an American jurisdiction because of the relative ease of communicating the most important (and the most controversial) testimony to the factfinder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case law supports such a result. For one thing, the facts as found by the district court closely parallel the situation in Piper, 454 U.S. at 257-58, 102 S.Ct. 252 (upholding a trial court determination that in spite of \"private interests point[ing] in both directions . . . fewer evidentiary problems would be posed if the trial were held in Scotland\"). For another thing, we have emphasized in an analogous context that \"the live testimony of [key] witnesses for the purposes of presenting demeanor evidence [is] essential to a fair trial.\" Howe v. Goldcorp Invs., Ltd., 946 F.2d 944, 952 (1st Cir. 1991). Indeed, on one occasion we approved a determination that because a particular witness's \"credibility would be pivotal to any judicial resolution of the factual issues at the root of the parties' dispute . . . deposition testimony and letters rogatory, even if available to the American court, would be less than satisfactory substitutes for in-person testimony.\" Mercier II, 981 F.2d at 1356. Finally, the Court has suggested that the availability of expert witnesses may not be as significant as the availability of fact witnesses. See Gilbert, 330 U.S. at 509, 67 S.Ct. 839. Given these authorities, we are unprepared to hold that the district court misused its discretion by dismissing the action in favor of an imperfect, but nonetheless highly preferable, forum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As her parting shot, the appellant laments the district court's finding that her financial position was irrelevant to its decision. This jeremiad misconstrues the situation. In Mercier II, we affirmed a finding that an alternate forum was adequate in spite of economic impositions on the plaintiffs, noting that the plaintiffs were not indigent and that inquiry into their financial capability to bring suit in the proposed alternate forum did not reveal any insuperable obstacles. See 981 F.2d at 1353. On appeal, the appellant, unlike in Mercier II, raises the impecuniousness argument not in terms of the adequacy of the alternate forum, but, rather, in terms of the balance of convenience. We agree with her underlying premise: at the second stage of a forum non conveniens analysis, financial hardships may be relevant. Moreover, even if such a hardship does not make foreign litigation impossible, it nonetheless may constitute one of the \"practical problems\" that help to determine whether trial of a case in a given venue will (or will not) be convenient. Gilbert, 330 U.S. at 508. That said, this avenue of inquiry proves a dead-end for Mrs. Iragorri.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mere suggestion of greater financial strain is meaningless unless and until the plaintiff demonstrates the nature and extent of the supposed limitations upon her ability to litigate. Here, the appellant wholly failed to adduce any evidence of her financial resources (or the lack thereof). It is hornbook law that an appellate argument cannot survive the proponent's failure to supply a sufficient factual predicate for it. See, e.g., Casa Marie Hogar Geriatrico, Inc. v. Rivera Santos, 38 F.3d 615, 618 n.2 (1st Cir. 1994); United States v. Slade, 980 F.2d 27, 30 (1st Cir. 1992). So it is here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. The appellant has advanced a golconda of arguments in an effort to persuade us that the decision to dismiss the case on forum non conveniens grounds represented an abuse of discretion. Even given the presumption in favor of the plaintiff's choice of forum, see Nowak, 94 F.3d at 270 -- a presumption that the district court acknowledged and to which it paid obeisance -- none of these arguments is convincing. That we, if writing on a pristine page, might have resolved the decisional calculus differently is of no moment. As the Supreme Court has written, \"where the [trial] court has considered all relevant public and private interest factors, and where its balancing of these factors is reasonable, its decision deserves substantial deference.\" Piper, 454 U.S. at 257.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Mrs. Iragorri sued in her own right and on behalf of her late husband's estate and heirs.

But Piper does not stand for so wooden a rule, and its language, fairly read, allows trial courts to give an unfavorable change in law some small weight at the second stage of the forum non conveniens inquiry insofar as it is relevant.

(IEI), alleging culpable negligence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The United States District Court for the District of Maine dismissed the claim against IEI on forum non conveniens grounds. Discerning no abuse of discretion, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A native of Colombia, Iragorri emigrated to the United States with his wife and two young children in the early 1980s. The family settled in Florida, and all four became naturalized citizens in 1989. In the fall of 1992, the children, then teenagers, were participating in an educational exchange program arranged by their Florida high school, and the appellant was living with them in Bogota. Iragorri also was in Colombia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. The Accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following events took place during the early morning hours of October 3, 1992. Shortly after 1:00 a.m., Iragorri entered the Portada del Mar, a partially finished apartment building in Cali, to visit his mother. The doorman, Danilo Osorio Garcia (Osorio), informed him that the elevators were out of order. Iragorri took the stairs to the fifth floor. The record is tenebrous concerning his condition; Osorio initially told investigators that Iragorri was inebriated, but later testified that he seemed fine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About ten minutes after Iragorri's arrival, Osorio heard a loud noise. Upon investigation, he claims to have found a screwdriver holding open the elevator doors on the fifth floor. He then heard moans emanating from the elevator shaft and discovered that Iragorri had plunged to the bottom, sustaining fatal injuries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. IEI's Role.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IEI was incorporated in Maine in 1924, as a subsidiary of Otis Elevator (Otis). Otis divested itself of its South American interests in 1988, spinning off IEI in the process. From that point forward, IEI operated exclusively in South America (although it retained its Maine charter). It still distributes and services Otis elevators. Although IEI did not install the elevators that serve the Portada del Mar complex, it did contract to maintain them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Roughly six hours before Iragorri entered the premises, Osorio called IEI to report that both of the building's elevators were out of order. An IEI employee, Gerardo Ortiz, responded promptly and determined that the cable on the left-hand elevator had snapped and that the elevator itself was in the basement. He proceeded to the fifth floor, opened the elevator doors, and worked on the right-hand elevator. When he was through, he claims to have closed the doors. He then went to the basement to inspect the downed left-hand elevator. Once there, he concluded that he would not be able to complete the repairs that day. He showed Osorio what was wrong with both elevators and asked Osorio to turn off the power pending his return. When questioned by officials, Ortiz could not explain how a screwdriver became wedged in the elevator doors (if, indeed, that was the case).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. The Litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mrs. Iragorri brought a wrongful death action against a number of defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. All the defendants moved to dismiss. The court retained jurisdiction over the claims against Otis and United Technologies (Otis's corporate parent),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> but determined that IEI was not subject to in personam jurisdiction in Connecticut and therefore transferred the case against it to Maine. See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1404(a). Apart from the fact that IEI had been incorporated in Maine (and was, therefore, amenable to service there), neither party had any significant contacts with that jurisdiction. When IEI moved for dismissal in the transferee court, the district judge referred the motion to a magistrate judge, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b), who recommended granting it on forum non conveniens grounds. Mrs. Iragorri objected. The district court, affording de novo review, approved the magistrate's report and recommendation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apart from errors of law, forum non conveniens determinations \"may be reversed only when there has been a clear abuse of discretion.\" Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">235</span></span>, 257 (1981). Such an abuse transpires if the nisi prius court (1) fails to consider a material factor; (2) relies substantially on an improper factor; or (3) assesses the appropriate factors but clearly errs in weighing them, with the result that its assessment falls outside the universe of plausible outcomes. See Nowak v. Tak How Invs., Ltd., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"725496\"><a href=\"/opinion/725496/ralph-m-nowak-administrator-of-the-estate-of-sally-ann-nowak-v-tak-how/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">708</span></a></span>, 719 (1st Cir. 1996); Mercier v. Sheraton Int'l, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"562613\"><a href=\"/opinion/562613/george-e-mercier-v-sheraton-international-inc-aka-itt-sheraton/\"><span class=\"volume\">935</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">419</span></a></span>, 423 (1st Cir. 1991) (Mercier I). In administering this test, a reviewing court must assiduously avoid twin temptations: it must neither substitute its judgment for that of the district court nor strike the balance of relevant factors anew. See Piper, 454 U.S. at 257.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a defendant moves for dismissal on forum non conveniens grounds, it bears the burden of showing both that an adequate alternative forum exists and that considerations of convenience and judicial efficiency strongly favor litigating the claim in the alternative forum. See Mercier I, 935 F.2d at 423-24. Courts generally deem the first requirement satisfied if the defendant demonstrates that the alternative forum addresses the types of claims that the plaintiff has brought and that the defendant is amenable to service of process there. See Piper, 454 U.S. at 254 n.22. The second requirement evokes a more sophisticated balancing: the defendant must show that the compendium of factors relevant to the private and public interests implicated by the case strongly favors dismissal. See Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104393\"><a href=\"/opinion/104393/gulf-oil-corp-v-gilbert/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">501</span></a></span>, 508-09 (1947); Mercier I, 935 F.2d at 423-24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has provided substantial guidance on the nature of the factors to be assayed in the second step of the analysis. Considerations relevant to the litigants' private interests include \"the relative ease of access to sources of proof; availability of compulsory process for attendance of unwilling, and the cost of obtaining attendance of willing, witnesses; [and the] possibility of view of premises, if view would be appropriate to the action.\" Gilbert, 330 U.S. at 508. Evaluating private interests also requires the trial judge to pay heed to \"all other practical problems that make trial of a case easy, expeditious and inexpensive.\" Id. We have no doubt that the flip side of this coin has equal pertinence; the judge must consider those factors that threaten to make trial more cumbersome, prolong it, or drive up costs. Factors relevant to the public interest include such things as the administrative difficulties of docket congestion; the general goal of \"having localized controversies decided at home,\" and concomitantly, ease of access to the proceedings on the part of interested citizens; the trier's relative familiarity with the appropriate rules of decision; and the burdens of jury duty. Id. at 508-09.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, as to both private and public interests, flexibility is the watchword. See Piper, 454 U.S. at 249-50. The compendia provided by the Court comprise a helpful starting point, but not every item applies in every case and, in the last analysis, the list of factors is illustrative rather than all-inclusive. \"[T]he ultimate inquiry is where trial will best serve the convenience of the parties and the ends of justice.\" Koster v. (American)Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104394\"><a href=\"/opinion/104394/koster-v-american-lumbermens-mut-casualty-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></a></span>, 527 (1947).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With this brief preface, we test the district court's decision against the two-step framework.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Adequate Alternative Forum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In considering a forum non conveniens claim, an inquiring court should begin by determining the existence vel non of an adequate alternative forum for the prosecution of the action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The court below impliedly concluded that Colombia constitutes such a forum. The appellant assails this conclusion on two bases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an initial matter, the appellant complains that the district court failed to afford due consideration to her family's apprehensions anent their personal safety should they be forced to litigate in Colombia. In her view, the attendant dangers, as evidenced by the State Department's advisory against unnecessary travel (especially to Cali), make Colombia an inadequate or unavailable alternative to the United States for the purpose of litigating her claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court explored this argument at some length.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> In the end, it found no particularized evidence that travel to Colombia would imperil the Iragorris, and, relatedly, found much evidence that they would be able to negotiate the country more easily than ordinary American visitors. These factors, the court concluded, neutralized the force of the State Department's warning. We cannot term this judgment unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are, of course, cases in which courts have discussed the possibility that the dangers inherent in traveling to a proposed forum might make litigation there a practical impossibility (and, thus, no real alternative). See, e.g., Rasoulzadeh v. Associated Press, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1866935\"><a href=\"/opinion/1866935/rasoulzadeh-v-associated-press/\"><span class=\"volume\">574</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

But see Guidi v. Inter-Continental Hotels Corp., No. 95 CIV. 9006 LAP, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">228360</span></span>, at *3-4 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 20, 1999) (limiting Rasoulzadeh to cases in which danger implicates the plaintiff's access to the alternate justice system). Nevertheless, it is the trial judge who best appreciates the case's nuances and the parties' circumstances, and the appellant points to no case in which an appellate tribunal has found overarching danger despite a trial court finding that the proposed forum constituted a viable alternative. The record reflects no basis to make this case the first.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a nimble attempt to sidestep this reality, the appellant lodges a claim of legal error: she asseverates that certain of the items cited by the district court as evidence that Colombia's dangers were less inhibitory to her and her children -- e.g., their previous Colombian citizenship, their residence in Colombia in 1991 and 1992, their family ties (the record mentions close relatives on both sides of the family who live in Colombia), the children's tenure as exchange students, and their conversance with the Spanish language -- were improperly factored into the equation. We do not agree. A plaintiff's familiarity with the alternative forum, her comfort level there, and her fluency in the language used in its courts may be weighed in deciding a forum non convenience motion. See Royal Bed &amp; Spring Co. v. Famossul Industria E Comercio de Moveis Ltda., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543592\"><a href=\"/opinion/543592/royal-bed-and-spring-co-inc-v-famossul-industria-e-comercio-de-moveis/\"><span class=\"volume\">906</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 52-53 (1st Cir. 1990); see also Marc O. Wolinsky, Comment, Forum Non Conveniens and American Plaintiffs in the Federal Courts, 47 U. Chi. L. Rev. 373, 382-83 (1980) (positing that American citizenship is a factor in favor of plaintiffs' convenience only insofar as it is a proxy for \"geography, language barriers, and unfamiliarity with foreign systems\") (cited with approval in Piper, 454 U.S. at 256 n.24). Although these factors more often relate to the second-stage balancing, we believe that in light of the appellant's contention that she and her children could not safely travel to Colombia, the court reasonably deemed them relevant to the suitability of the proposed alternative forum. It follows that, on the peculiar facts of this case, the district court did not commit an abuse of discretion in assigning diminished weight to the State Department's advisory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second strand of the appellant's argument derives from a footnote in which the Piper Court stated that if \"the remedy offered by the other forum is clearly unsatisfactory, the other forum may not be an adequate alternative.\" 454 U.S. at 254 n.22. Using footnote 22 as a springboard, the appellant asserts that the lack of an adequate remedy under Colombian law renders a Colombian forum inconcinnous for purposes of this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Refined to bare essence, this assertion boils down to a claim that the Colombian Supreme Court occasionally has limited damages for pain and suffering in wrongful death actions (called \"moral damages\" there) to amounts that seem paltry when converted into United States dollars.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lower court's weighing of the proof on this point withstands scrutiny. The court found no credible evidence of an artificial ceiling on provable economic loss applicable to wrongful death actions brought in Colombia and, relatedly, found no credible evidence to support the appellant's suggestion that a lid of some sort applies generally in such cases. At worst, a plaintiff forced to litigate a wrongful death action in Colombia rather than in an American jurisdiction faces a downgrade in remedy, i.e., an institutional inhospitability to generous awards for non-economic losses. This circumstance, in and of itself, does not impugn the adequacy of the proposed alternative forum. See, e.g., id. at 255 (holding that the unavailability of a cause of action for strict liability does not render the alternate forum inadequate); Ahmed v. Boeing Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"426375\"><a href=\"/opinion/426375/saleem-ahmed-v-the-boeing-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">720</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span>, 226 (1st Cir. 1983) (stating that the unsatisfactory remedy exception applies only \"where transfer to a foreign forum means application of a substantive law that is both different and basically unjust\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not tarry. Here, the district court supportably found that the Colombian courts entertain wrongful death actions, that they grant both pecuniary and moral damages in such suits, that the statute of limitations had not expired in Colombia, and that IEI was amenable to service of process there. It also found the appellant's evidence of unfavorable changes in the law to be weak, disputed, and ultimately unconvincing. No more is exigible to sustain the court's determination that an adequate alternative forum exists. Cf. Piper, 454 U.S. at 254 n.22 (predicting that footnote 22 would come into play only \"[i]n rare circumstances\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Private and Public Interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having verified the district court's implicit conclusion that an adequate alternative forum exists, we turn to the second stage of the inquiry. Before reaching the merits, however, we must address a threshold matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second-stage inquiry, as we have said, directs the trial court to balance an array of factors relevant to both private and public interests, and to ascertain whether that balance justifies dismissal. The usual formulation of the rule of decision, adopted by the district court, focuses on the defendant's ability to prove that the result of the balancing \"strongly favor[s]\" the alternative forum. Mercier I, 935 F.2d at 423-24. The appellant challenges this formulation and suggests that a trial court should not dismiss for forum non conveniens \"except upon a clear showing of facts\" that makes the plaintiff's preferred forum inappropriate because they \"establish such oppressiveness and vexation to a defendant as to be out of all proportion to plaintiff's convenience.\" Koster, 330 U.S. at 524 (dictum).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, the lower court's decision demonstrates an awareness of the appropriate legal standards for forum non conveniens analysis. The Koster Court's use of the term \"oppressiveness and vexation\" neither created an independent standard nor raised the bar for dismissal in forum non conveniens cases. See Alcoa S.S. Co. v. M/V Nordic Regent, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"392287\"><a href=\"/opinion/392287/alcoa-steamship-company-inc-v-mv-nordic-regent-her-boilers-tackle/\"><span class=\"volume\">654</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">147</span></a></span>, 151-52 (2d Cir. 1980) (en banc); Pain v. United Techs. Corp., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">637</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">775</span></span>, 783 (D.C. Cir. 1980); cf. Lacey v. Cessna Aircraft Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"514809\"><a href=\"/opinion/514809/graeme-macarthur-lacey-v-cessna-aircraft-company-a-corporation-hanlon/\"><span class=\"volume\">862</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span>, 42, 44 (3d Cir. 1988) (quoting Koster and then summarizing the applicable standard as imposing a burden to show that the aggregate of relevant factors \"weigh[s] heavily on the side of dismissal\"). Lower courts often must tease a standard from a plethora of phrases that collectively describe a legal principle, and the court below correctly divined that, at the second stage of the inquiry, a defendant's right to obtain a dismissal on forum non conveniens grounds hinges on whether it can show that considerations of convenience and judicial efficiency strongly favor the proposed alterative forum. After all, the \"strongly favors\" language has deep roots in Supreme Court precedent, see Gilbert, 330 U.S. at 508, and the Court's subsequent mentions of the Koster dictum lend no support to the notion that the dictum somehow supplanted the \"strongly favors\" test. See, e.g., Norwood v. Kirkpatrick, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105294\"><a href=\"/opinion/105294/norwood-v-kirkpatrick/\"><span class=\"volume\">349</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 35 (1955). This court heretofore has used the \"strongly favors\" standard as a distillation of the \"oppressiveness and vexation\" language, see Mercier I, 935 F.2d at 423-24, and we continue to believe that this is the proper perspective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the balancing of the relevant private and public interests. We start by acknowledging the thoroughness of the district court's canvass; it thoughtfully discussed all the pertinent factors cited by the parties and reacted to each item. On a more global note, the court explained why convenience, efficiency, and fairness all militated in favor of a trial in Colombia. It emphasized that the accident had occurred there and that Ortiz and Osorio -- the two principal witnesses on liability -- would play leading roles at trial. The court remarked the need to gauge these witnesses' credibility and stressed the salience of demeanor evidence in that endeavor. It then observed that neither witness could be compelled to attend a trial in Maine and that, in any event, both men were Spanish speakers. In addition, the court noted that, should the case proceed in Maine, IEI would be unable to implead other potentially responsible parties, that it would be impossible to conduct a view, and that unfamiliar law would supply the substantive rules of decision. Considering these and other factors, the court determined that the balance of private and public interests strongly favored recourse to a Colombian forum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's attack on this determination occurs on several fronts. First, she declares that the court gave lip service to, but did not enforce, IEI's burden of proof. In an effort to document this ipse dixit, she asserts that the court expressed some ambivalence, stating at one point that \"neither forum alternative in this case is particularly satisfactory,\" yet nonetheless granted IEI's motion to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not think that this allusion undermines the district court's ruling. First, the quoted statement is not necessarily at odds with the use of the correct standard. See infra at 16-17. Second, since other references in the decision make it plain that the court fully understood the operative legal principles, even an infelicitous choice of phrase would not warrant reversal. See Lenn v. Portland Sch. Comm, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"611562\"><a href=\"/opinion/611562/daniel-lenn-etc-v-portland-school-committee/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1083</span></a></span>, 1087-88 (1st Cir. 1993); Clauson v. Smith, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"491456\"><a href=\"/opinion/491456/charles-clauson-v-robert-d-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">823</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">660</span></a></span>, 663 n.3 (1st Cir. 1987); United States v. Kobrosky, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"421132\"><a href=\"/opinion/421132/united-states-v-milton-l-kobrosky/\"><span class=\"volume\">711</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">449</span></a></span>, 456 (1st Cir. 1983). The lower court's rescript makes pellucid its awareness of the correct burden of proof, and it reached a result that was entirely consonant with that burden. In such circumstances, we decline to presume that the court said one thing and did another.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant next asserts that the district court failed to consider the public interest that attaches to resolving a wrongful death action brought by United States citizens in a federal court. Here, too, her argument borders on the metaphysical. The district court mentioned the tenet that a United States court has a particular interest in an action brought by a citizen, see Mercier I, 935 F.2d at 429-30, and proceeded to weigh the appellant's, her children's, and her decedent's citizenship in the balance. The court also noted, however, that a plaintiff's lack of relationship to the forum state may diminish the ultimate influence of this interest. This countervailing consideration was properly added to the mix both as a matter of legal theory, see Mercier v. Sheraton Int'l, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597109\"><a href=\"/opinion/597109/george-e-mercier-and-susan-y-mercier-v-sheraton-international-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">981</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1345</span></a></span>, 1355 (1st Cir. 1992) (Mercier II), and as a matter of fact (given Maine's tenuous relationship to the case). Thus, the appellant's plaint, stripped of rhetorical flourishes, is less that the district court overlooked a factor and more that the court chose to synthesize several related factors. We see no abuse of discretion in the court's handling of this aspect of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant also maintains that the district court overemphasized the importance of the testimony to be given by Ortiz and Osorio, and impermissibly discounted the witnesses that she planned to call (who, she said, would refuse to appear in Colombia because of incipient danger there). Once again, the court explicitly addressed these concerns. It recognized that trial in Colombia likely would dissuade certain witnesses from appearing in person, but found that the problems of proof would be exacerbated, not ameliorated, by a trial in Maine (where crucial liability witnesses whose credibility was under attack most likely would appear, if at all, by video deposition with the assistance of a translator). In the court's view, the language barrier would prevent an American jury from evaluating their credibility effectively. The appellant's suggested witnesses were experts, concerned primarily with damages, and the court decided that their testimony would be more amenable to depositions and translation (if, indeed, local experts could not be retained).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a judgment call, pure and simple, and illustrates the wisdom of granting the district court a margin of discretion in the area of forum non conveniens. The trial judge is in the best position to know the interstices of any particular case and to evaluate both the parties' interests and the likely efficacy of the truth-finding process. See Gilbert, 330 U.S. at 508. Given the standard of review, it is not within our proper purview to disturb a trial court's reasoned, record-rooted determination that justice could be done more perfectly in a foreign forum than in an American jurisdiction because of the relative ease of communicating the most important (and the most controversial) testimony to the factfinder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case law supports such a result. For one thing, the facts as found by the district court closely parallel the situation in Piper, 454 U.S. at 257-58, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110586\"><a href=\"/opinion/110586/piper-aircraft-co-v-reyno/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span> (upholding a trial court determination that in spite of \"private interests point[ing] in both directions . . . fewer evidentiary problems would be posed if the trial were held in Scotland\"). For another thing, we have emphasized in an analogous context that \"the live testimony of [key] witnesses for the purposes of presenting demeanor evidence [is] essential to a fair trial.\" Howe v. Goldcorp Invs., Ltd., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"570021\"><a href=\"/opinion/570021/reginald-h-howe-v-goldcorp-investments-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">946</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">944</span></a></span>, 952 (1st Cir. 1991). Indeed, on one occasion we approved a determination that because a particular witness's \"credibility would be pivotal to any judicial resolution of the factual issues at the root of the parties' dispute . . . deposition testimony and letters rogatory, even if available to the American court, would be less than satisfactory substitutes for in-person testimony.\" Mercier II, 981 F.2d at 1356. Finally, the Court has suggested that the availability of expert witnesses may not be as significant as the availability of fact witnesses. See Gilbert, 330 U.S. at 509, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104393\"><a href=\"/opinion/104393/gulf-oil-corp-v-gilbert/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">839</span></a></span>. Given these authorities, we are unprepared to hold that the district court misused its discretion by dismissing the action in favor of an imperfect, but nonetheless highly preferable, forum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As her parting shot, the appellant laments the district court's finding that her financial position was irrelevant to its decision. This jeremiad misconstrues the situation. In Mercier II, we affirmed a finding that an alternate forum was adequate in spite of economic impositions on the plaintiffs, noting that the plaintiffs were not indigent and that inquiry into their financial capability to bring suit in the proposed alternate forum did not reveal any insuperable obstacles. See 981 F.2d at 1353. On appeal, the appellant, unlike in Mercier II, raises the impecuniousness argument not in terms of the adequacy of the alternate forum, but, rather, in terms of the balance of convenience. We agree with her underlying premise: at the second stage of a forum non conveniens analysis, financial hardships may be relevant. Moreover, even if such a hardship does not make foreign litigation impossible, it nonetheless may constitute one of the \"practical problems\" that help to determine whether trial of a case in a given venue will (or will not) be convenient. Gilbert, 330 U.S. at 508. That said, this avenue of inquiry proves a dead-end for Mrs. Iragorri.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mere suggestion of greater financial strain is meaningless unless and until the plaintiff demonstrates the nature and extent of the supposed limitations upon her ability to litigate. Here, the appellant wholly failed to adduce any evidence of her financial resources (or the lack thereof). It is hornbook law that an appellate argument cannot survive the proponent's failure to supply a sufficient factual predicate for it. See, e.g., Casa Marie Hogar Geriatrico, Inc. v. Rivera Santos, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195704\"><a href=\"/opinion/195704/casa-marie-inc-v-superior-court-of-pr/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">615</span></a></span>, 618 n.2 (1st Cir. 1994); United States v. Slade, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"595481\"><a href=\"/opinion/595481/united-states-v-frances-slade/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 30 (1st Cir. 1992). So it is here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. The appellant has advanced a golconda of arguments in an effort to persuade us that the decision to dismiss the case on forum non conveniens grounds represented an abuse of discretion. Even given the presumption in favor of the plaintiff's choice of forum, see Nowak, 94 F.3d at 270 -- a presumption that the district court acknowledged and to which it paid obeisance -- none of these arguments is convincing. That we, if writing on a pristine page, might have resolved the decisional calculus differently is of no moment. As the Supreme Court has written, \"where the [trial] court has considered all relevant public and private interest factors, and where its balancing of these factors is reasonable, its decision deserves substantial deference.\" Piper, 454 U.S. at 257.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Mrs. Iragorri sued in her own right and on behalf of her late husband's estate and heirs.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">159</span></a></span>, 169 (D. Conn. 1999). That decision is presently on appeal to the Second Circuit.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Because the district judge adopted the magistrate's report without embellishment, we do not distinguish between the two judicial officers, but refer to the decision below as the district court's.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The district court blended the \"adequacy of forum\" and \"balance of interests\" analyses, thus violating this precept. While such informality is disfavored, we deem the court's error harmless in this instance, for the court ultimately made a sufficiently distinct determination on each point.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The appellant proffered, and the district court mulled, a travel advisory issued on March 26, 1998, wherein the State Department \"warn[ed] U.S. citizens against unnecessary travel to Colombia,\" noting that \"[v]iolence by narcotraffickers, guerrillas, paramilitary groups and other criminal elements continues to affect all parts of the country [and that] U.S. citizens have been the victims of recent threats, kidnappings and murders.\" The advisory singled out Cali for special attention \"due to the heightened threat in that city.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The parties seem to assume that evidence of a particular forum's less favorable law is germane only if the difference is extreme, and that even then the evidence relates only to the forum's adequacy. But Piper does not stand for so wooden a rule, and its language, fairly read, allows trial courts to give an unfavorable change in law some small weight at the second stage of the forum non conveniens inquiry insofar as it is relevant.
