This  case requires  us to\r                      LYNCH,  Circuit Judge.\r                                           \r\n\ndetermine whether  section  440(a) of  the Antiterrorism  and\r\n\nEffective  Death  Penalty  Act  (AEDPA),  enacted  after this\r\n\npetition was filed, applies here.  Alfredo Kolster, an  alien\r\n\nunder deportation order,  argues that if it does apply, it is\r\n\nunconstitutional.  Section 440(a)  of AEDPA, which was signed\r\n\ninto  law on  April 24,  1996, prohibits  judicial  review of\r\n\ndeportation orders issued  against aliens who have  committed\r\n\ncertain types  of crimes.  Kolster had previously pled guilty\r\n\nto such a crime.\r\n\n          In a petition filed with this court on February 28,\r\n\n1996, Kolster seeks review of  a Board of Immigration Appeals\r\n\n(BIA)  decision  that  he  is  ineligible,  under  the  BIA's\r\n\ninterpretation of the Immigration  and Nationality Act (INA),\r\n\nfor discretionary  relief from  deportation.  He  argues that\r\n\nthe BIA erroneously interpreted  the statute to require seven\r\n\nyears  of  lawful  permanent  residence by  the  alien  to be\r\n\neligible for the relief  from deportation afforded by section\r\n\n212(c) of the INA.  \r\n\n          The  Immigration  and Naturalization  Service (INS)\r\n\nhas moved to dismiss this action, arguing that section 440(a)\r\n\nof  AEDPA  operates  immediately  to  divest  this  court  of\r\n\njurisdiction  to  hear this  petition  for  review.   Kolster\r\n\nresponds that section 440(a) does not apply to  cases pending\r\n\non  the date of AEDPA's  enactment, and that,  if the statute\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\napplies, its  preclusion of judicial review  violates the Due\r\n\nProcess Clause and Article III of the Constitution.\r\n\n          We  find   that  section  440(a)   does  apply   to\r\n\npetitions, like Kolster's, which were pending on the date  of\r\n\nAEDPA's enactment.  Because at least the habeas corpus review\r\n\nprovided  by the  Constitution  remains  available to  aliens\r\n\ncovered by section  440(a), we find  that the prohibition  of\r\n\njudicial  review  in  section  440(a)  does  not  offend  the\r\n\nConstitution.  Accordingly, we dismiss Kolster's petition for\r\n\nreview under the Immigration and Nationality  Act for lack of\r\n\njurisdiction.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n          Alfredo  Kolster,  a   Venezuelan  citizen,   first\r\n\nentered  the United States in  1980 to attend  high school in\r\n\nNew  York.   He remained  in the  United States  through high\r\n\nschool and college,  earning a B.S. from Boston University in\r\n\nSeptember, 1988.   During this  time, Kolster had  a F-1,  or\r\n\nforeign student, visa.\r\n\n          On  September  11, 1988,  after  a  brief visit  to\r\n\nVenezuela, Kolster  re-entered the United States  as a member\r\n\nof the  immediate family of  an employee of  an international\r\n\norganization.  His mother  worked for the Pan-American Health\r\n\nOrganization.   On August 24,  1989, Kolster became  a lawful\r\n\npermanent  resident of the United States.  From 1989 to 1991,\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nKolster  lived in the Boston area and worked at various sales\r\n\njobs.\r\n\n          In 1991,  Kolster was indicted in  federal court in\r\n\nMassachusetts for conspiracy  to possess cocaine  with intent\r\n\nto distribute.   He later  pled guilty and  was sentenced  to\r\n\ntwenty-four  months'  imprisonment.    The  sentencing  judge\r\n\nrecommended  that Kolster  not be  deported upon  his release\r\n\nfrom custody.\r\n\n          Nonetheless,  while  Kolster was  incarcerated, the\r\n\nINS  ordered him to show cause why he should not be deported.\r\n\nThe  INS  charged that  Kolster  was  deportable pursuant  to\r\n\nsection 241(a)(2)(B)(i)  of the INA, which  applies to aliens\r\n\nconvicted of  controlled substance offenses, and  pursuant to\r\n\nsection 241(a)(2)(A)(iii), which applies to  aliens convicted\r\n\nof aggravated felonies.  See 8 U.S.C.   1251 (a).\r                                        \r\n\n          On  April 5, 1994, Kolster  had a hearing before an\r\n\nImmigration  Judge.    At  that  hearing,  Kolster,   through\r\n\ncounsel, conceded deportability on the grounds charged by the\r\n\nINS.    However, he also requested  a continuance in order to\r\n\napply  for a waiver of deportation pursuant to section 212(c)\r\n\nof  the INA.  Section  212(c) gives the  Attorney General the\r\n\ndiscretionary authority to  waive the exclusion of  otherwise\r\n\nexcludable aliens,  see 8  U.S.C.   1182(c).1  A longstanding\r                                   \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Section 212(c) of the  INA, 8 U.S.C.   1182(c),  prior to\r\namendment by AEDPA, read in relevant part:\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\ninterpretation of that section extends the Attorney General's\r\n\ndiscretion to otherwise deportable aliens.  See, e.g., Joseph\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. INS, 909 F.2d 605, 606 n.1 (1st Cir. 1990).\r                  \r\n\n          The Immigration Judge  found \"based on  [Kolster's]\r\n\nadmission,  his concession of  deportability through counsel,\r\n\nand the documentary evidence of record that deportability has\r\n\nbeen  established  by   clear,  convincing  and   unequivocal\r\n\nevidence.\"   As to  Kolster's request for  a continuance, the\r\n\nImmigration Judge  found that Kolster did  not have statutory\r\n\neligibility   for  section   212(c)  relief,   and  therefore\r\n\npretermitted his  application for  a  waiver of  deportation.\r\n\nAccordingly, she ordered Kolster deported to Venezuela.\r\n\n          On January 30, 1996, the BIA affirmed the order  of\r\n\ndeportation.  The Board agreed with the decision to pretermit\r\n\nKolster's  application  for a  section 212(c)  waiver because\r\n\nKolster  had \"not  been a  lawful permanent  resident  of the\r\n\nUnited States for seven years as is required.\"\r\n\n          Kolster filed a petition for review with this court\r\n\non February  28, 1996.   At  that time,  8 U.S.C.    1105a(a)\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n          Aliens  lawfully  admitted for  permanent\r\n          residence .  . .  who are returning  to a\r\n          lawful  unrelinquished domicile  of seven\r\n          consecutive years, may be admitted in the\r\n          discretion of the Attorney General.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nprovided for judicial review of final orders of deportation.2\r\n\nKolster argued that the BIA has erred in interpreting section\r\n\n212(c)'s requirement of seven years of \"lawful unrelinquished\r\n\ndomicile\"  to   mean  seven  years  of     \"lawful  permanent\r\n\nresidence.\"  Kolster  points  to  a  circuit  split  on  this\r\n\nstatutory  issue, noting  that  some courts  of appeals  have\r\n\nrejected the BIA's construction of section 212(c).  See, e.g,\r                                                                         \r\n\nLok v. INS, 548 F.2d 37 (2d Cir. 1977).\r                      \r\n\n          On April 24, 1996, while this petition was pending,\r\n\nPresident  Clinton  signed  into  law  the  Antiterrorism and\r\n\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Pub. L. No. 104-\r\n\n132, 110 Stat. 1214.   Section 440(a) of AEDPA,  which amends\r\n\nSection  106(a)(10)  of  the  INA, 8  U.S.C.     1105(a)(10),\r\n\nprovides:\r\n\n          Any final order of deportation against an\r\n          alien  who  is  deportable  by  reason of\r\n          having    committed    [certain   crimes,\r\n          including    aggravated   felonies    and\r\n          controlled substance  offenses] shall not\r\n          be subject to review by any court.\r\n\nOn June  10, 1996, the INS moved to dismiss this petition for\r\n\nreview, arguing that, in light of section 440(a),  this court\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  8  U.S.C.     1105a(a)   provided  that  the   procedures\r\ndescribed  therein \"shall apply to, and shall be the sole and\r\nexclusive  procedure for,  the judicial  review of  all final\r\norders of  deportation heretofore or  hereafter made  against\r\naliens within the United States.\"\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nlacked  subject  matter  jurisdiction  to  hear  this  case.3\r\n\nKolster  responds that  AEDPA does  not specify  an effective\r\n\ndate  for section  440(a),  and that  statutes are  generally\r\n\npresumed not  to have  retroactive effect.   Additionally, he\r\n\ncontends that preclusion of  judicial review violates the Due\r\n\nProcess Clause and Article III.\r\n\n                         II.\r\n\nA. Section 440(a)'s Applicability to Pending Petitions\r                                                                  \r\n\n          The Supreme  Court's  decision in  Landgraf v.  USI\r                                                                         \r\n\nFilm Products, 114 S.  Ct. 1483 (1994), provides  a framework\r                         \r\n\nfor  determining whether a statute should be applied to cases\r\n\npending  at the  time  of enactment.    This is  initially  a\r\n\nquestion  of  legislative  intent,     not  a  constitutional\r\n\nquestion.  First, the  court must look at the  statutory text\r\n\nand  determine  whether it  \"manifests  an  intent\" that  the\r\n\nstatute should be applied to pending cases.  Id. at 1492.  If\r                                                            \r\n\nthe  court  determines  that  Congress  did  not   \"expressly\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  The INS originally also  argued that this petition sought\r\nrelief --  a waiver  of deportation  under section  212(c) --\r\nwhich petitioner was no longer eligible  to receive.  Section\r\n440(d)  of AEDPA amends section  212(c) so that  it no longer\r\napplies  to aliens  who are  deportable  by reason  of having\r\ncommitted  certain  crimes,  including  controlled  substance\r\noffenses and  aggravated felonies.   The Attorney  General is\r\ncurrently  considering whether  to  apply  section 440(d)  to\r\nsection 212(c) applications filed before April 24, 1996.  See\r                                                                         \r\nIn  re Soriano,  Order  of the  Attorney  General (Sept.  12,\r                          \r\n1996),  vacating  Int. Dec.  No.  3289  (BIA June  27,  1996,\r                            \r\namended July 18, 1996).  Because we find  that the court does\r\nnot  have jurisdiction to hear this petition, we do not reach\r\nthe  question of  whether section  440(d) applies  to pending\r\napplications.   \r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nprescribe[] the statute's  proper reach,\" the court  presumes\r\n\nthat Congress acts  consistently with  a series  of \"judicial\r\n\ndefault rules.\"   Id. at 1505.  In applying  these rules, the\r                                 \r\n\ncourt must:\r\n\n          determine whether the  new statute  would\r\n          have retroactive effect, i.e., whether it\r\n          would  impair  rights  a party  possessed\r\n          when   he   acted,  increase   a  party's\r\n          liability for past conduct, or impose new\r\n          duties   with  respect   to  transactions\r\n          already completed.\r\n\nId.  For jurisdictional statutes, the presumption is in favor\r               \r\n\nof  immediate application,  because  \"[a]pplication of  a new\r\n\njurisdictional  rule usually 'takes away no substantive right\r\n\nbut  simply changes the tribunal  that is to  hear the case'\"\r\n\nand because  \"jurisdictional statutes 'speak to  the power of\r\n\nthe court rather  than to  the rights or  obligations of  the\r\n\nparties.'\"   Id. at 1502  (quoting Hallowell v.  Commons, 239\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. 506,  508  (1916)  and Republic  Nat'l  Bank  v.

Ct. 554, 565 (1992)(Thomas, J., concurring)).\r                  \r\n\n          The  first  inquiry is  thus  whether Congress  has\r\n\nexpressed a clear intent as to whether section 440(a) applies\r\n\nto cases  pending  on the  date of  enactment.   There is  no\r\n\nexplicit textual  reference to an effective  date for section\r\n\n440(a).  Effective dates are provided for some other sections\r\n\nof the  AEDPA, including section 440(e),  which adds offenses\r\n\nto the INA definition of \"aggravated felony.\"  See 8 U.S.C.  \r                                                              \r\n\n1101  note.

It is true that  Landgraf speaks of\r                                                               \r\n\njurisdictional  statutes as  usually \"'simply  chang[ing] the\r\n\ntribunal that is to hear the case.'\"  Landgraf, 114 S.

In Hallowell, the\r                                                                    \r\n\nSupreme Court approved the application  to pending cases of a\r\n\nstatute  that  deprived   the  federal  district   courts  of\r\n\njurisdiction over  certain Indian probate disputes and vested\r\n\n\"final  and conclusive\"  authority  in the  Secretary of  the\r\n\nInterior.  239 U.S.  at 508.  Section 440(a)  similarly vests\r\n\nfinal  authority  in  an  administrative tribunal,  the  BIA.\r\n\nLandgraf's  citation to Hallowell  makes us  doubtful, absent\r                                             \r\n\nmore guidance  from the Supreme Court,  that a jurisdictional\r\n\nchange  from  an  Article  III  court  to  an  administrative\r\n\ndecisionmaker, in itself, affects the retroactivity analysis,\r\n\nwhatever its effect on  the ultimate constitutional analysis.\r\n\nSee Hincapie-Nieto v. INS, 92 F.3d 27, 29 (2nd Cir. 1996).\r                                     \r\n\n          Our  inquiry  must  therefore  focus on  the  facts\r\n\nconcerning   whether   Kolster's   substantive    rights   or\r\n\nobligations or duties have been changed by the deprivation of\r\n\njudicial review.  Kolster  suggests that his guilty plea  and\r\n\nconcession of  deportability were  made with the  expectation\r\n\nthat  he  could   apply  for  a  section  212(c)   waiver  of\r\n\ndeportation.\r\n\n          The  Seventh  Circuit gave  credence,  on different\r\n\nfacts, to  a similar argument  in Reyes-Hernandez v.  INS, 89\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d 490, 492 (7th Cir.  1996).  There, the BIA  had affirmed\r\n\nthe denial  of petitioner's  application  for section  212(c)\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nrelief,  and  the petitioner  sought  judicial  review.   The\r\n\nSeventh   Circuit  found   that,  when   petitioner  conceded\r\n\ndeportability, he knew that, if the immigration judge and the\r\n\nBIA  turned down  his request for  section 212(c)  relief, he\r\n\n\"could  have a  go at\"  judicial  review.   Id.  at 492.  Had\r                                                           \r\n\npetitioner known  that judicial  review would  be foreclosed,\r\n\n\"he might have  contested deportability.\"  Id.  The immediate\r                                                          \r\n\napplication of section 440(a) would thus \"attach  a new legal\r\n\nconsequence to the concession\" of deportability.  Id. at 492-\r                                                                 \r\n\n93.    Accordingly, the  Seventh  Circuit  held that  section\r\n\n440(a)  did not  apply to  cases  in which  deportability was\r\n\nconceded  prior to  AEDPA's  enactment,  \"provided  that  the\r\n\napplicant for discretionary relief would have had at least  a\r\n\ncolorable defense to deportability.\"  Id.\r                                                     \r\n\n          In contrast  to the Seventh Circuit,  it is unclear\r\n\nto  us  that deportability,  which  is  a largely  mechanical\r\n\ndetermination based  on facts which may  often be objectively\r\n\nascertained, would realistically  be conceded because  of the\r\n\navailability of discretionary relief or of judicial review of\r\n\nthe denial of such relief.  See Hincapie-Nieto, 92 F.3d at 30\r                                                          \r\n\n(\"It  is  far  more  likely that  deportability  is  conceded\r\n\nbecause there is no conceivable defense available.\").  In any\r\n\ncase, here the Immigration Judge explicitly based her finding\r\n\nof  deportability on  the  documentary evidence  of Kolster's\r\n\ndrug  offense  conviction,  as  well as  on  his  concession.\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nTellingly,  Kolster  does not  argue that  he  in fact  had a\r\n\ncolorable defense to deportability. \r\n\n          As to his guilty  plea, we have no reason  to think\r\n\nit  was induced  by  reliance on  discretionary relief  under\r\n\nsection 212(c).   By Kolster's own  calculations, his \"lawful\r\n\ndomicile\"  for section  212(c)  purposes only  dates back  to\r\n\nSeptember  11, 1988.  Thus,  even under the interpretation of\r\n\nsection  212(c) that he urges,  as of September  2, 1992, the\r\n\ndate  of his guilty plea, Kolster had only accrued four years\r\n\nof  lawful domicile.  He  was, as a  result, three years away\r\n\nfrom being  eligible for section 212(c)  relief, rendering it\r\n\nhighly unlikely  that his guilty  plea was predicated  on the\r\n\navailability of such relief.\r\n\n          Moreover, this  court  and others  have  previously\r\n\nfound that aliens do not have a cognizable  reliance interest\r\n\nin  the availability of  discretionary section 212(c) relief.\r\n\nSee,  e.g., Scheidemann v. INS,  83 F.3d 1517,  1523 (3d Cir.\r                                          \r\n\n1996); Campos v.

At issue in those cases\r                  \r\n\nwas  an amendment to section 212(c) which made aliens who had\r\n\nserved at  least five  years' imprisonment for  an aggravated\r\n\nfelony  ineligible  for  discretionary  relief.    See,  e.g,\r                                                                        \r\n\nBarreiro, 989 F.2d at 62.  In Barreiro, this court found that\r                                                  \r\n\nthe  amendment's application  to prisoners  whose convictions\r\n\nand  prison terms predated its  enactment did not violate the\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\npresumption  against  retroactivity.

This is\r\n\nscarcely a situation calling for any such warning.\"  Id. \r                                                                    \r\n\n          Similar logic  applies here.  As  the Third Circuit\r\n\nsaid in Schiedemann,  petitioner's \"conduct clearly subjected\r                               \r\n\nhim to deportation  as well as criminal sanctions,  and . . .\r\n\n[section] 212(c), as it then existed, offered relief from the\r\n\nformer  only at  the  unfettered discretion  of the  Attorney\r\n\nGeneral  .  . .  .\"    Schiedemann, 83  F.3d  at  1523.   The\r                                              \r\n\navailability of purely  discretionary relief does  not create\r\n\nsubstantive rights  in otherwise deportable  criminal aliens,\r\n\nnor  does the  availability of judicial  review of  denial of\r\n\nthat discretionary relief.\r\n\n          We   find   that   Kolster's  substantive   rights,\r\n\nliabilities, and duties are not retroactively impaired by the\r\n\npreclusion of judicial review.  We note that five of  the six\r\n\nother  circuit courts  to consider  this question  have found\r\n\nthat section 440(a) applies upon enactment.

Kolster argues that deportation deprives him of\r\n\na  constitutionally protected liberty  interest, and that the\r\n\nDue  Process Clause  thus  guarantees him  certain procedural\r\n\nprotections,  including  judicial   review.     Additionally,\r\n\nKolster argues that section  440(a), by giving \"the Executive\r\n\nBranch the power to act as legal arbiter of its own conduct,\"\r\n\nprevents the judiciary from  fulfilling its Article III \"role\r\n\nas a 'check' on the actions of the two other branches.\"\r\n\n          The INS responds that  section 440(a) is \"clearly a\r\n\nconstitutional exercise of  Congress' well-established  power\r\n\nto provide or  withhold jurisdiction from statutorily-created\r\n\ncourts,  as  well  as  its  plenary  power  over  matters  of\r\n\nimmigration and naturalization.\"  Because we consider this to\r\n\nbe  a  serious  question,  this  court  requested  additional\r\n\nbriefing on whether habeas corpus review remains available to\r\n\naliens who  are covered by  section 440(a)'s bar  on judicial\r\n\nreview.\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\n          The question of section  440(a)'s constitutionality\r\n\nis  not wholly  resolved  by reference  to Congress'  plenary\r\n\npower over matters concerning immigration.

Our  cases have  frequently\r\n          suggested  that  a  continuously  present\r\n          alien  is entitled to a fair hearing when\r\n          threatened    with    deportation,   and,\r\n          although  we have  only rarely  held that\r\n          the procedures provided by  the executive\r\n          were  inadequate,  we developed  the rule\r\n          that  a  continuously  present  permanent\r\n          resident alien has a right to due process\r\n          in such a situation. \r\n\nLandon  v.

The  INS's precise position is that such constitutionally\r\ncompelled habeas review, or its equivalent, remains, and that\r\nwe need not here  determine \"whether the jurisdictional basis\r\nfor 'constitutional  habeas'  review of  a deportation  order\r\nwould be 28 U.S.C.   2241, section 1651, or a 'free standing'\r\nConstitutional  authorization.\"    For  present  purposes, we\r\ndescribe the alternatives as \"habeas review.\"\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nimpair  the ability of the  federal courts to  grant writs of\r\n\nhabeas corpus under the general habeas provision, 28 U.S.C.  \r\n\n2241, and  that such habeas review  would encompass questions\r\n\nof law  like the  one  Kolster raises  here.   Cf. Felker  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nTurpin,  116 S.  Ct.  2333, 2339  (1996)  (declining to  find\r                  \r\n\njurisdictional repeal by implication).\r\n\n          Because the  INS acknowledges that some  avenue for\r\n\njudicial   review   remains   available   to   address   core\r\n\nconstitutional  and  jurisdictional  concerns, we  find  that\r\n\nsection 440(a)'s  repeal of our jurisdiction  to review final\r\n\ndeportation orders does not raise a constitutional issue.  As\r\n\nthe nature  and scope  of habeas  review available  to aliens\r\n\nlike Kolster  is not properly before  us at this  time, we do\r\n\nnot reach  those questions.

Alfredo Kolster, an  alien\r\n\nunder deportation order,  argues that if it does apply, it is\r\n\nunconstitutional.  Section 440(a)  of AEDPA, which was signed\r\n\ninto  law on  April 24,  1996, prohibits  judicial  review of\r\n\ndeportation orders issued  against aliens who have  committed\r\n\ncertain types  of crimes.  Kolster had previously pled guilty\r\n\nto such a crime.\r\n\n          In a petition filed with this court on February 28,\r\n\n1996, Kolster seeks review of  a Board of Immigration Appeals\r\n\n(BIA)  decision  that  he  is  ineligible,  under  the  BIA's\r\n\ninterpretation of the Immigration  and Nationality Act (INA),\r\n\nfor discretionary  relief from  deportation.  He  argues that\r\n\nthe BIA erroneously interpreted  the statute to require seven\r\n\nyears  of  lawful  permanent  residence by  the  alien  to be\r\n\neligible for the relief  from deportation afforded by section\r\n\n212(c) of the INA.  \r\n\n          The  Immigration  and Naturalization  Service (INS)\r\n\nhas moved to dismiss this action, arguing that section 440(a)\r\n\nof  AEDPA  operates  immediately  to  divest  this  court  of\r\n\njurisdiction  to  hear this  petition  for  review.   Kolster\r\n\nresponds that section 440(a) does not apply to  cases pending\r\n\non  the date of AEDPA's  enactment, and that,  if the statute\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\napplies, its  preclusion of judicial review  violates the Due\r\n\nProcess Clause and Article III of the Constitution.\r\n\n          We  find   that  section  440(a)   does  apply   to\r\n\npetitions, like Kolster's, which were pending on the date  of\r\n\nAEDPA's enactment.  Because at least the habeas corpus review\r\n\nprovided  by the  Constitution  remains  available to  aliens\r\n\ncovered by section  440(a), we find  that the prohibition  of\r\n\njudicial  review  in  section  440(a)  does  not  offend  the\r\n\nConstitution.  Accordingly, we dismiss Kolster's petition for\r\n\nreview under the Immigration and Nationality  Act for lack of\r\n\njurisdiction.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n          Alfredo  Kolster,  a   Venezuelan  citizen,   first\r\n\nentered  the United States in  1980 to attend  high school in\r\n\nNew  York.   He remained  in the  United States  through high\r\n\nschool and college,  earning a B.S. from Boston University in\r\n\nSeptember, 1988.   During this  time, Kolster had  a F-1,  or\r\n\nforeign student, visa.\r\n\n          On  September  11, 1988,  after  a  brief visit  to\r\n\nVenezuela, Kolster  re-entered the United States  as a member\r\n\nof the  immediate family of  an employee of  an international\r\n\norganization.  His mother  worked for the Pan-American Health\r\n\nOrganization.   On August 24,  1989, Kolster became  a lawful\r\n\npermanent  resident of the United States.  From 1989 to 1991,\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nKolster  lived in the Boston area and worked at various sales\r\n\njobs.\r\n\n          In 1991,  Kolster was indicted in  federal court in\r\n\nMassachusetts for conspiracy  to possess cocaine  with intent\r\n\nto distribute.   He later  pled guilty and  was sentenced  to\r\n\ntwenty-four  months'  imprisonment.    The  sentencing  judge\r\n\nrecommended  that Kolster  not be  deported upon  his release\r\n\nfrom custody.\r\n\n          Nonetheless,  while  Kolster was  incarcerated, the\r\n\nINS  ordered him to show cause why he should not be deported.\r\n\nThe  INS  charged that  Kolster  was  deportable pursuant  to\r\n\nsection 241(a)(2)(B)(i)  of the INA, which  applies to aliens\r\n\nconvicted of  controlled substance offenses, and  pursuant to\r\n\nsection 241(a)(2)(A)(iii), which applies to  aliens convicted\r\n\nof aggravated felonies.  See 8 U.S.C.   1251 (a).\r                                        \r\n\n          On  April 5, 1994, Kolster  had a hearing before an\r\n\nImmigration  Judge.    At  that  hearing,  Kolster,   through\r\n\ncounsel, conceded deportability on the grounds charged by the\r\n\nINS.    However, he also requested  a continuance in order to\r\n\napply  for a waiver of deportation pursuant to section 212(c)\r\n\nof  the INA.  Section  212(c) gives the  Attorney General the\r\n\ndiscretionary authority to  waive the exclusion of  otherwise\r\n\nexcludable aliens,  see 8  U.S.C.   1182(c).1  A longstanding\r                                   \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Section 212(c) of the  INA, 8 U.S.C.   1182(c),  prior to\r\namendment by AEDPA, read in relevant part:\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\ninterpretation of that section extends the Attorney General's\r\n\ndiscretion to otherwise deportable aliens.

The Board agreed with the decision to pretermit\r\n\nKolster's  application  for a  section 212(c)  waiver because\r\n\nKolster  had \"not  been a  lawful permanent  resident  of the\r\n\nUnited States for seven years as is required.\"\r\n\n          Kolster filed a petition for review with this court\r\n\non February  28, 1996.

This is  initially  a\r\n\nquestion  of  legislative  intent,     not  a  constitutional\r\n\nquestion.  First, the  court must look at the  statutory text\r\n\nand  determine  whether it  \"manifests  an  intent\" that  the\r\n\nstatute should be applied to pending cases.  Id. at 1492.  If\r                                                            \r\n\nthe  court  determines  that  Congress  did  not   \"expressly\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  The INS originally also  argued that this petition sought\r\nrelief --  a waiver  of deportation  under section  212(c) --\r\nwhich petitioner was no longer eligible  to receive.  Section\r\n440(d)  of AEDPA amends section  212(c) so that  it no longer\r\napplies  to aliens  who are  deportable  by reason  of having\r\ncommitted  certain  crimes,  including  controlled  substance\r\noffenses and  aggravated felonies.   The Attorney  General is\r\ncurrently  considering whether  to  apply  section 440(d)  to\r\nsection 212(c) applications filed before April 24, 1996.  See\r                                                                         \r\nIn  re Soriano,  Order  of the  Attorney  General (Sept.  12,\r                          \r\n1996),  vacating  Int.

Kolster  suggests that his guilty plea  and\r\n\nconcession of  deportability were  made with the  expectation\r\n\nthat  he  could   apply  for  a  section  212(c)   waiver  of\r\n\ndeportation.\r\n\n          The  Seventh  Circuit gave  credence,  on different\r\n\nfacts, to  a similar argument  in Reyes-Hernandez v.

There, the BIA  had affirmed\r\n\nthe denial  of petitioner's  application  for section  212(c)\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nrelief,  and  the petitioner  sought  judicial  review.   The\r\n\nSeventh   Circuit  found   that,  when   petitioner  conceded\r\n\ndeportability, he knew that, if the immigration judge and the\r\n\nBIA  turned down  his request for  section 212(c)  relief, he\r\n\n\"could  have a  go at\"  judicial  review.   Id.  at 492.

The immediate\r                                                          \r\n\napplication of section 440(a) would thus \"attach  a new legal\r\n\nconsequence to the concession\" of deportability.  Id. at 492-\r                                                                 \r\n\n93.    Accordingly, the  Seventh  Circuit  held that  section\r\n\n440(a)  did not  apply to  cases  in which  deportability was\r\n\nconceded  prior to  AEDPA's  enactment,  \"provided  that  the\r\n\napplicant for discretionary relief would have had at least  a\r\n\ncolorable defense to deportability.\"  Id.\r                                                     \r\n\n          In contrast  to the Seventh Circuit,  it is unclear\r\n\nto  us  that deportability,  which  is  a largely  mechanical\r\n\ndetermination based  on facts which may  often be objectively\r\n\nascertained, would realistically  be conceded because  of the\r\n\navailability of discretionary relief or of judicial review of\r\n\nthe denial of such relief.  See Hincapie-Nieto, 92 F.3d at 30\r                                                          \r\n\n(\"It  is  far  more  likely that  deportability  is  conceded\r\n\nbecause there is no conceivable defense available.\").  In any\r\n\ncase, here the Immigration Judge explicitly based her finding\r\n\nof  deportability on  the  documentary evidence  of Kolster's\r\n\ndrug  offense  conviction,  as  well as  on  his  concession.\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nTellingly,  Kolster  does not  argue that  he  in fact  had a\r\n\ncolorable defense to deportability. \r\n\n          As to his guilty  plea, we have no reason  to think\r\n\nit  was induced  by  reliance on  discretionary relief  under\r\n\nsection 212(c).   By Kolster's own  calculations, his \"lawful\r\n\ndomicile\"  for section  212(c)  purposes only  dates back  to\r\n\nSeptember  11, 1988.  Thus,  even under the interpretation of\r\n\nsection  212(c) that he urges,  as of September  2, 1992, the\r\n\ndate  of his guilty plea, Kolster had only accrued four years\r\n\nof  lawful domicile.  He  was, as a  result, three years away\r\n\nfrom being  eligible for section 212(c)  relief, rendering it\r\n\nhighly unlikely  that his guilty  plea was predicated  on the\r\n\navailability of such relief.\r\n\n          Moreover, this  court  and others  have  previously\r\n\nfound that aliens do not have a cognizable  reliance interest\r\n\nin  the availability of  discretionary section 212(c) relief.\r\n\nSee,  e.g., Scheidemann v.

The\r                                              \r\n\navailability of purely  discretionary relief does  not create\r\n\nsubstantive rights  in otherwise deportable  criminal aliens,\r\n\nnor  does the  availability of judicial  review of  denial of\r\n\nthat discretionary relief.\r\n\n          We   find   that   Kolster's  substantive   rights,\r\n\nliabilities, and duties are not retroactively impaired by the\r\n\npreclusion of judicial review.

Additionally,\r\n\nKolster argues that section  440(a), by giving \"the Executive\r\n\nBranch the power to act as legal arbiter of its own conduct,\"\r\n\nprevents the judiciary from  fulfilling its Article III \"role\r\n\nas a 'check' on the actions of the two other branches.\"\r\n\n          The INS responds that  section 440(a) is \"clearly a\r\n\nconstitutional exercise of  Congress' well-established  power\r\n\nto provide or  withhold jurisdiction from statutorily-created\r\n\ncourts,  as  well  as  its  plenary  power  over  matters  of\r\n\nimmigration and naturalization.\"  Because we consider this to\r\n\nbe  a  serious  question,  this  court  requested  additional\r\n\nbriefing on whether habeas corpus review remains available to\r\n\naliens who  are covered by  section 440(a)'s bar  on judicial\r\n\nreview.\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\n          The question of section  440(a)'s constitutionality\r\n\nis  not wholly  resolved  by reference  to Congress'  plenary\r\n\npower over matters concerning immigration.

Were\r                                     \r\n\nno other avenues of judicial review available to aliens  like\r\n\npetitioner,  we  would be  required  to  resolve that  thorny\r\n\nquestion here.\r\n\n          However,  the INS has  agreed that,  although AEDPA\r\n\nhas repealed the previous statutory authorization for  habeas\r\n\nreview of  final  deportation  orders  contained  in  section\r\n\n106(a)(10)  of the INA, any habeas review that is required by\r\n\nthe Constitution  remains available.4  Kolster  contends that\r\n\nthe  repeal of  the specific  INA habeas  provision does  not\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  The  INS's precise position is that such constitutionally\r\ncompelled habeas review, or its equivalent, remains, and that\r\nwe need not here  determine \"whether the jurisdictional basis\r\nfor 'constitutional  habeas'  review of  a deportation  order\r\nwould be 28 U.S.C.   2241, section 1651, or a 'free standing'\r\nConstitutional  authorization.\"    For  present  purposes, we\r\ndescribe the alternatives as \"habeas review.\"\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nimpair  the ability of the  federal courts to  grant writs of\r\n\nhabeas corpus under the general habeas provision, 28 U.S.C.  \r\n\n2241, and  that such habeas review  would encompass questions\r\n\nof law  like the  one  Kolster raises  here.   Cf. Felker  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nTurpin,  116 S.  Ct.  2333, 2339  (1996)  (declining to  find\r                  \r\n\njurisdictional repeal by implication).\r\n\n          Because the  INS acknowledges that some  avenue for\r\n\njudicial   review   remains   available   to   address   core\r\n\nconstitutional  and  jurisdictional  concerns, we  find  that\r\n\nsection 440(a)'s  repeal of our jurisdiction  to review final\r\n\ndeportation orders does not raise a constitutional issue.  As\r\n\nthe nature  and scope  of habeas  review available  to aliens\r\n\nlike Kolster  is not properly before  us at this  time, we do\r\n\nnot reach  those questions.   See Hincapie-Nieto, 92  F.2d at\r                                                            \r\n\n31.\r\n\n          Accordingly, the petition  for review is  dismissed\r\n\nfor lack of jurisdiction.\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n</pre>",
