Gene Carter, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                  Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n\n     Jane Elizabeth Lee on brief for appellant.\n     Paula D. Silsby, United States Attorney, and Margaret D.\nMcGaughey, Appellate Chief, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                         February 1, 2002\n\f             Per    Curiam.       Enrique     Melendez    appeals     from    his\n\n sentence, claiming violation of Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c) and his\n\n due process right to be sentenced on the basis of accurate\n\n information.       He faults the sentencing court for failing to:\n\n 1) recommend him for participation in a Bureau of Prisons\n\n (BOP) drug treatment program, and 2) make an unambiguous\n\n finding with regard to alleged factual inaccuracies in his\n\n presentence report (“PSR”).\n\n             With    respect       to   the    first     argument,     we    lack\n\n jurisdiction to review the sentencing court’s failure to\n\n recommend to the BOP that it admit Melendez to a drug\n\n treatment    program. 1          “Decisions      to     place    a   convicted\n\n defendant    within     a    particular        treatment        program    or   a\n\n particular facility are decisions within the sole discretion\n\n of the Bureau of Prisons.” Thye v. United States, 109 F.3d\n\n 127, 130 (2d Cir. 1997) (citation and internal quotation\n\n marks   omitted).            A     sentencing         court’s     non-binding\n\n recommendation to the BOP is not a reviewable order. United\n\n States v. Serafini, 233 F.3d 758, 778 (3d Cir. 2000); United\n\n States v. De La Pena-Juarez, 214 F.3d 594, 601 (5th Cir.),\n\n cert. denied, 531 U.S. 983 (2000); United States v. Pineyro,\n\n    1 We note that, by federal statute, the BOP is required to\n“make available appropriate substance abuse treatment for each\nprisoner the Bureau determines has a treatable condition of\nsubstance addiction or abuse.” 18 U.S.C. § 3621(b).\n\f112 F.3d 43, 45-46 (2d Cir. 1997).         By like token, the\n\nomission of such a recommendation is a non-appealable event.\n\n         With respect to the second argument, we conclude\n\nthat the lower court adequately complied with Rule 32(c) and\n\nthat it was not required to delete the controverted portions\n\nof the PSR.   We explain briefly.\n\n         Melendez’s objection to paragraph 8 of the PSR was\n\nnot an objection to the factual accuracy of the information\n\ncontained therein but to its inclusion in the report.      In\n\nother words, Melendez did not dispute the truth of the\n\nstatements about weapon possession by co-defendant Amado\n\nLopez, but objected to any mention of those facts in the PSR\n\non the ground that the facts did not pertain to Melendez.\n\nWe agree with the Ninth Circuit that because this objection\n\n“went to the inclusion of the statements . . . not to their\n\nfactual accuracy, . . . the district court was not required\n\nby Rule 32(c)(3)(D) to respond to [it] at sentencing.”\n\nUnited States v. Turner, 898 F.2d 705, 710 (9th Cir. 1990).\n\nWe note, moreover, that, at the disposition hearing, the\n\ncourt did indicate its clear understanding that the PSR\n\nfailed to show “that any of that conduct with respect to\n\nthose firearms involved this defendant.”    Melendez expressed\n\nhis satisfaction with that understanding when the court\n\n\n                            -3-\n\farticulated it, and agreed to withdraw his objection to\n\nparagraph       8    of   the   PSR      at    that    juncture.      Thus,    the\n\nassignment of error anent paragraph 8 of the PSR is doubly\n\nflawed.\n\n            The defendant also objects to the reference to his\n\nostensible weapon possession in paragraph 13 of the PSR.                         In\n\nthat instance, too, the court satisfied the requirements of\n\nRule 32(c). We have held that “[a] court may make implicit\n\nfindings on disputed factual questions by accepting the\n\ngovernment’s recommendations at the sentencing hearing.”\n\nUnited States v. Cruz, 981 F.2d 613, 619 (1 st Cir. 1992)\n\n(citations omitted); accord United States v. Grant, 114 F.3d\n\n323, 327 (1st Cir. 1997); United States v. Ovalle-Marquez, 36\n\nF.3d 212, 227 (1st Cir. 1994).                  Here, the court, at the very\n\nleast,    made       an   implicit       finding      that    Melendez   did   not\n\npossess     a       weapon    in    connection         with    the   offense     of\n\nconviction.         After all, the government recommended that the\n\ncourt not make a two-level increase to the base offense\n\nlevel under U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(1) for possession of a\n\ndangerous           weapon,        and        the     court     accepted       that\n\nrecommendation.            To cinch matters, the court’s explicit\n\nfinding that the government could not meet its burden of\n\nproof with respect to that enhancement constitutes a finding\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\f sufficient to resolve the contested matter in conformance\n\n with Rule 32(c).\n\n           The defendant argues that the court nonetheless was\n\n required to delete the original reference from the PSR.       We\n\n do not agree.   Once the court complied with Rule 32(c) by\n\n resolving the matter of Melendez’s weapon possession in his\n\n favor, no more was exigible.     “Neither due process nor Rule\n\n 32 requires a district court judge to be an editor as well\n\n as an arbiter of justice.” Turner, 898 F.2d at 710.\n\n           Finally, the defendant argues that the sentencing\n\n court’s decision to deny him a recommendation for treatment\n\n somehow   “attests   to   the   veracity   of   the   [contested]\n\n statements in the [PSR].” Appellant’s Br. at 34.         Implicit\n\n in that argument is the unfounded assumption that conviction\n\n for an offense involving weapon possession precludes the\n\n defendant, qua inmate, from participating in drug treatment\n\n programs. The relevant statute contains no such prohibition,\n\n and Melendez points to no other authority to support his\n\n assumption.2\n\n\n    2 BOP regulations provide that inmates convicted of a felony\noffense that involved the carrying, possession or use of a\nfirearm are not eligible for sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3621(e). See 28 CFR § 550.58. But Melendez never asked the\ncourt to recommend that he be granted early release following\ncompletion of a drug treatment program. The court’s declination\nto recommend participation in a drug treatment program implies\n\n                                 -5-\n\f           We need go no further.   For aught that appears, the\n\n defendant was lawfully sentenced.     The judgment below is,\n\n therefore, affirmed. See Loc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\nnothing about Melendez’s eligibility for early release following\ncompletion of such a program.\n\n                              -6-\n\f",

To cinch matters, the court's explicit finding that the government could not meet its burden of proof with respect to that enhancement constitutes a finding sufficient to resolve the contested matter in conformance with Rule 32(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant argues that the court nonetheless was required to delete the original reference from the PSR. We do not agree. Once the court complied with Rule 32(c) by resolving the matter of Melendez's weapon possession in his favor, no more was exigible. \"Neither due process nor Rule 32 requires a district court judge to be an editor as well as an arbiter of justice.\" <i>Turner,</i> 898 F.2d at 710.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the defendant argues that the sentencing court's decision to deny him a recommendation for treatment somehow \"attests to the veracity of the [contested] statements in the [PSR].\" Appellant's Br. at 34. Implicit in that argument is the unfounded assumption that conviction for an offense involving weapon possession precludes the defendant, qua inmate, from participating in drug treatment programs. The relevant statute contains no such prohibition, and Melendez points to no other authority to support his assumption.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For aught that appears, the defendant was lawfully sentenced. The judgment below is, therefore, <i>affirmed. See</i> Loc. R. 27(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We note that, by federal statute, the BOP is required to \"make available appropriate substance abuse treatment for each prisoner the Bureau determines has a treatable condition of substance addiction or abuse.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3621(b)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> BOP regulations provide that inmates convicted of a felony offense that involved the carrying, possession or use of a firearm are not eligible for sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3621(e)<i>See</i> 28 CFR &#167; 550.58. But Melendez never asked the court to recommend that he be granted early release following completion of a drug treatment program. The court's declination to recommend participation in a drug treatment program implies nothing about Melendez's eligibility for early release following completion of such a program.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
