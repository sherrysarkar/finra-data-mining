This  appeal requires  us to\r                    TORRUELLA,  Chief Judge\r                                           \r\n\ninterpret and apply the confidentiality provisions of the Federal\r\n\nJuvenile Delinquency Act (the \"Act\"), 18 U.S.C.    5031-5042.  We\r\n\nhold  that the Act authorizes,  but does not  mandate, closure of\r\n\njuvenile  proceedings.   Although we  disagree with  the district\r\n\ncourt's interpretation of the  statute, we nevertheless find that\r\n\nthe  court's  decision to  close the  proceedings was  within its\r\n\ndiscretion and proper under the Act.\r\n\n                                I.\r                                          I.\r\n\n          On  July  19,   1994,  the  government  charged   three\r\n\njuveniles with civil rights violations under the Federal Juvenile\r\n\nDelinquency Act (the \"Act\"), 18 U.S.C.    5031-5042.  The charges\r\n\ninvolved \"hate  crimes\" allegedly  committed by the  juveniles as\r\n\nmembers of a white supremacist  group.  On the same day  that the\r\n\njuveniles were charged, the  grand jury indicted an adult,  Brian\r\n\nClayton,  with  violations  of 18  U.S.C.     241 (conspiracy  to\r\n\nviolate civil  rights) and    371 (conspiracy  to intimidate  and\r\n\ninterfere  with  federally  protected  activities  on account  of\r\n\nrace).    The indictment  charges  that  Clayton committed  these\r\n\nviolations as a  member of  the same white  supremacist group  to\r\n\nwhich the three juveniles allegedly belonged.\r\n\n          Just prior  to the juveniles' arraignments  on July 20,\r\n\n1994, intervenor-appellant Globe Newspaper Company  (the \"Globe\")\r\n\nmoved to  intervene in the  juvenile proceedings for  purposes of\r\n\ngaining access to the arraignments and subsequent proceedings, as\r\n\nwell  as to any judicial documents filed in connection with those\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nproceedings.   The district court allowed the  Globe to intervene\r\n\nand granted  it access to  certain redacted court  documents, but\r\n\ndenied  public access to the  arraignments on the  grounds that  \r\n\n5038  of the  Act mandated  closure of  the proceedings.   United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Three Juveniles, Globe Newspaper Co., 862 F. Supp. 651,\r                                                        \r\n\n658 (D. Mass. 1994).  The court alternatively held  that, even if\r\n\nclosure  were discretionary,  it would  close the  proceedings in\r\n\nthis case.  See id. at 658.  The Globe argues on appeal  that the\r                            \r\n\nFirst   Amendment  creates   a  right   of  access   to  juvenile\r\n\nproceedings, that  the district  court erred by  interpreting the\r\n\nAct  to mandate  closure of  juvenile proceedings,  and that  the\r\n\nfactors set forth and  relied upon by  the district court in  its\r\n\nopinion are not sufficiently compelling to justify closure of the\r\n\nproceedings.\r\n\n                               II.\r                                         II.\r\n\n          The  issues  presented  by   this  appeal  involve  the\r\n\ninterpretation and constitutionality of certain provisions of the\r\n\nAct.   Because these are purely  questions of law,  our review is\r\n\nplenary.   See United States  v. Gifford,  17 F.3d 462,  472 (1st\r                                                  \r\n\nCir. 1994); see also United States v.

The\r\n\nstatute  also contains confidentiality  provisions, set  forth in\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n   5032  and 5038.1   Enacted in 1938,  the Act was  intended \"to\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  Section 5032 provides in relevant part that:\r\n\n            . . . any proceedings against [an alleged\r\n            juvenile  delinquent]  shall  be   in  an\r\n            appropriate district court of  the United\r\n            States.

The\r\n\nconfidentiality  provisions  of  the  Act  are   therefore  quite\r\n\nessential  to   the  Act's  statutory   scheme  and   overarching\r\n\nrehabilitative purpose.\r\n\n          Based on its reading of the statute and its legislative\r\n\nhistory, the district  court held  that the Act  allowed it  some\r\n\ndiscretion to disclose information about juvenile proceedings, so\r\n\nlong as the disclosure does not contravene the \"express  mandate\"\r\n\nof   5038(e)  that the juvenile's  name and  picture not be  made\r\n\npublic.   862 F.

In  a  very instructive  case,\r                    \r\n\nhowever, the Court addressed whether the First Amendment allows a\r\n\nstatutory bar  to public access  to adult criminal  trials during\r\n\nthe  testimony of sex-offense victims who are minors.  See Globe,\r                                                                          \r\n\n457 U.S. at  607.   Although the Supreme  Court acknowledged  the\r\n\ncompelling state interests of protecting the victims from further\r\n\ntrauma and  embarrassment and  encouraging other victims  to come\r\n\nforward, it  held that neither interest  sufficiently justified a\r\n\nblanket closure  in every  case involving a  youthful sex-offense\r\n\nvictim.  Id. at 607.  The Court explained:\r                     \r\n\n            [A]s  compelling  as  that  interest  [in\r\n            protecting the minor victims] is, it does\r\n            not justify a mandatory closure rule, for\r                                             \r\n            it is clear that the circumstances of the\r\n            particular    case    may   affect    the\r\n            significance  of the  interest.   A trial\r\n            court  can  determine  on a  case-by-case\r\n            basis  whether  closure  is necessary  to\r\n            protect   the   welfare   of    a   minor\r\n            victim. . . .  Section 16A,  in contrast,\r\n            requires  closure even if the victim does\r\n            not seek the  exclusion of the  press and\r\n            general  public,  and  would  not  suffer\r\n            injury  by  their presence.  .  .  .   In\r\n            short,     16A  cannot  be  viewed  as  a\r\n            narrowly tailored  means of accommodating\r\n            the  State's  asserted  interest:    That\r\n            interest could be served  just as well by\r\n            requiring the trial court to determine on\r\n            a case-by-case basis whether  the State's\r\n            legitimate concern for the  well-being of\r\n            the  minor  victim necessitates  closure.\r\n            Such   an   approach  ensures   that  the\r\n            constitutional right of the press and the\r\n            public to gain access to  criminal trials\r\n            will  not  be  restricted   except  where\r\n            necessary   to    protect   the   State's\r\n            interest.\r\n\nId.

Relying on the Court's language in Globe, 457 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\nat  607-08, 611,  the  Globe contends  that the  district court's\r\n\nconstruction  of  the  Act   as  imposing  \"a  mandatory  closure\r\n\nrequirement  on  all  juvenile   proceedings\"  renders  the   Act\r\n\nunconstitutional.

We therefore must examine the Act's purpose and\r\n\nlanguage to determine whether  it is necessary to call  the Act's\r\n\nconstitutionality into  question by  construing it to  mandate an\r\n\nacross-the-board bar to public access.\r\n\n                               IV.\r                                         IV.\r\n\n          As we have explained, the primary purpose of the Act is\r\n\nto facilitate the  rehabilitation of juvenile delinquents.

Protection  of the juvenile from\r                      \r\n\nthe stigma of a criminal record by preserving the confidentiality\r\n\nof proceedings is  an essential  element of  the Act's  statutory\r\n\nscheme.  See discussion supra at 5.\r                                       \r\n\n          The  government argues  that  the Act's  rehabilitative\r\n\npurpose can only be  effectuated by prohibiting public disclosure\r\n\nof information about juvenile  proceedings, and contends that the\r\n\nAct's  language  explicitly  so  directs.   The  Globe  contends,\r\n\nconversely, that the Act's language does not mandate closure, but\r\n\nleaves  the decision to  the district  court's discretion,  to be\r\n\ndetermined  on a case-by-case basis.  In so contending, the Globe\r\n\nrelies  heavily on   PG Publishing,  28 F.3d  at 1359-60,  and we\r                                            \r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nagree  that the Third Circuit's  reasoning in that  case is quite\r\n\npersuasive.\r\n\n          As the  district court  acknowledged, the Act  does not\r\n\nexpressly  require a  closed hearing  for a  juvenile proceeding.\r\n\n862  F. Supp.  at 655.   Section  5032 of  the Act  provides that\r\n\njuvenile  proceedings may  be  convened \"at  any  time and  place\r\n\nwithin  the  district, in  chambers or  otherwise.\"   This phrase\r\n\ncertainly seems  to contemplate  that district court  judges will\r\n\nexercise their discretion  to determine when, where,  and in what\r\n\nmanner  juvenile proceedings  will  be conducted.   Moreover,  we\r\n\nagree  with the Third Circuit  that the language  \"in chambers or\r\n\notherwise\" strongly implies that the district court's  discretion\r\n\nincludes  \"a decision  regarding the  availability and  degree of\r\n\npublic access.\"  PG Publishing, 28 F.3d at 1359.  This section of\r                                        \r\n\nthe Act  therefore provides  \"strong evidence\" that  Congress did\r\n\nnot  intend mandatory  closure of  all juvenile  proceedings, but\r\n\nrather left the question of public access to the district court's\r\n\ndiscretion.  Id.\r                         \r\n\n          The first paragraph of   5038(a) of the Act states that\r\n\n\"the records  [of any  juvenile proceeding] shall  be safeguarded\r\n\nfrom  disclosure  to unauthorized  persons.\"    Pointing to  this\r\n\nprovision,  the  government  contends  that  the  Act  explicitly\r\n\nprohibits disclosure  of juvenile records except  to the entities\r\n\nenumerated  in  subsequent paragraphs,  and  that  this evidences\r\n\nCongressional  intent  to  create  an  across-the-board   ban  on\r\n\ndisclosure  to any  and  all other  parties.   We  do  not think,\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nhowever, that  this language is quite so  conclusive; the section\r\n\ndoes not explicitly  mandate denial of public  access to juvenile\r                                      \r\n\nrecords,  but   provides  only  that   the  records  are   to  be\r\n\n\"safeguarded  from disclosure to  unauthorized persons.\"   Giving\r                                                        \r\n\nthis  phrase a less strained, more common sense reading, we think\r\n\nthat the section prohibits  disclosure only to those persons  not\r\n\nauthorized  by the  district court  to receive  such information.\r                                            \r\n\nSee   PG  Publishing,  28   F.3d  at  1359   (reaching  the  same\r                              \r\n\nconclusion).   The only express prohibitive  mandate contained in\r\n\nall  of   5038(a) rests  in the final  paragraph, which prohibits\r\n\nthe district  court  from authorizing  disclosure  in  situations\r\n\n\"when the  request for information  is related to  an application\r\n\nfor  employment,   license,  bonding   or  any  civil   right  or\r\n\nprivilege.\"\r\n\n          Nor  do  we  think   that  the  parties  enumerated  in\r\n\nparagraphs  (a)(1)  through  (a)(6)  of     5038  constitute  the\r\n\nexclusive  list of persons  intended by Congress  to ever receive\r\n\ninformation  about juvenile proceedings.   Rather, the paragraphs\r\n\nmerely list those  persons who  have a right  to obtain  juvenile\r\n\nrecords  upon  request.   Indeed,  if this  were  meant to  be an\r\n\nexclusive  list,   then  the  final  paragraph   of  the  section\r\n\n(prohibiting  disclosure  when  the   information  is  sought  in\r\n\nrelation  to a job application,  etc.) would be  superfluous.  PG\r                                                                           \r\n\nPublishing, 28  F.3d at 1360.   Read as  a whole, then,  we think\r                    \r\n\nthat    5038(a) further  evidences Congressional intent  to leave\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\ndisclosure  of  juvenile  records  within  the  district  court's\r\n\ndiscretion.5\r\n\n          The only section of the Act that suggests that Congress\r\n\nintended  an across-the-board bar to  public access is   5038(e),\r\n\nwhich provides that \"neither the name nor picture of any juvenile\r\n\nshall be  made public in  connection with a  juvenile delinquency\r\n\nproceeding.\"   The  district court  reasoned that  if it  were to\r\n\npermit  public access  to the  proceedings, the  juveniles' names\r\n\nwould  certainly,   unavoidably,  be   made  public,   in  direct\r\n\ncontravention of   5038(e).  862 F. Supp. at 655.  Because it saw\r\n\nno  way to  obey the  letter of    5038(e)  short of  closing the\r\n\nproceedings, the  district court  interpreted the Act  to mandate\r\n\nclosure.   Id. at 655-56.  The  government now urges us to affirm\r                       \r\n\nthis interpretation, arguing that  any other reading would render\r\n\nthe confidentiality provisions a nullity.\r\n\n          On this point, however, we are  persuaded once again by\r\n\nthe reasoning of the PG Publishing court, which explained:\r                                            \r\n\n            A prohibition against making a juvenile's\r\n            name or picture available to  the public,\r\n            however,  strikes us  as an  indirect and\r\n            unlikely  way  for Congress  to stipulate\r\n            that all hearings  under the Act  will be\r\n            closed  to  the public.    State statutes\r\n            that   restrict    access   to   juvenile\r\n            proceedings generally do so  directly and\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n5    The  language  of     5038(c)  does  not  conflict  with our\r\ninterpretation.   This section provides that  all information and\r\nrecords  relating  to  the  proceeding \"shall  not  be  disclosed\r\ndirectly or  indirectly to anyone  other than the  judge, counsel\r\nfor the juvenile  and the  Government, or  others entitled  under\r                                                                           \r\nthis section to receive juvenile records.\"  (Emphasis added).  We\r                                                  \r\nread the underlined  phrase to mean any other  persons authorized\r\nby the court to receive information under   5038(a).\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\n            clearly. . . .   We  think  it  far  more\r\n            likely that   5038(e) was intended not to\r\n            limit  the discretion of  trial judges to\r\n            regulate  access to  juvenile delinquency\r\n            proceedings,   but   to   foreclose   law\r\n            enforcement officials  from holding press\r\n            conferences at which the name and picture\r\n            of the juvenile would  be \"made public in\r\n            connection  with  a juvenile  delinquency\r\n            proceeding.\"\r\n\n28 F.3d at 1360-61 (quoting 18 U.S.C.   5038(e)).  Certainly,  if\r\n\nCongress intended to mandate closure of all juvenile proceedings,\r\n\nit  could have done  so expressly  and directly.   Cf.,  e.g., 18\r                                                                       \r\n\nU.S.C.    3509(e) (authorizing \"the exclusion  from the courtroom\r\n\nof all persons, including members of the press, who do not have a\r\n\ndirect  interest  in  the case\"  during  the  testimony of  child\r\n\nwitnesses).\r\n\n          We  also  agree  with  the   Globe  that  even  if  the\r\n\nprohibition  on  disclosure  of  a juvenile's  name  and  picture\r\n\nprevents  unfettered public  access to  proceedings, it  does not\r\n\nnecessarily follow  that   5038(e)  commands total closure.   The\r\n\nstatutory directive can  in many instances be satisfied by other,\r\n\nless restrictive means.  For example, public access to records or\r\n\nproceedings  poses  no  risk  of  disclosure  of  the  juvenile's\r\n\npicture,  as cameras can be banned from the proceedings and names\r\n\nredacted from documents.   Similarly, there are methods  short of\r\n\ncomplete closure, such as the use of initials or pseudonyms, that\r\n\nwould  protect against  inadvertent disclosure of  the juveniles'\r\n\nnames.\r\n\n          Finally, we  think that interpreting the  entire Act in\r\n\nlight  of    5038(e), rather  than vice  versa,  attributes undue\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\nsignificance to that section.  To hold that the Act must  mandate\r\n\nclosure  because of    5038(e)  is effectively  to ignore  strong\r\n\nindicia  elsewhere in the statute that Congress did not intend to\r\n\ncreate a blanket prohibition on public access, but rather to vest\r\n\ndiscretion with the district courts  to fashion proceedings in  a\r\n\nmanner most appropriate for each individual case.\r\n\n          For  these  reasons,  we hold  that  the  Act does  not\r\n\nmandate  across-the-board closure  for all  juvenile proceedings,\r\n\nbut merely authorizes closure, or  any other measures designed to\r\n\nensure confidentiality, to be  determined on a case-by-case basis\r\n\nat the discretion  of the district  court.6   We think that  this\r\n\ninterpretation fully  comports with  the purpose and  language of\r\n\nthe  statute as  a whole,  and is  far preferable  to  a strained\r\n\nconstruction of the Act that  mandates complete closure and  thus\r\n\ntriggers First Amendment concerns.\r\n\n                                V.\r                                          V.\r\n\n          We turn now to the Globe's final contentions on appeal,\r\n\nnamely, that the district court's articulated reasons for closing\r\n\nthe  proceedings are  not  \"sufficiently compelling\"  to  justify\r\n\nclosure in this case, that the court's order does not effectively\r\n\nserve its intended interests, and that the order is not \"narrowly\r\n\ntailored.\"  The Globe offers several theories in support of these\r\n\ncontentions, none of which we find persuasive.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n6  We  emphasize that we are not holding  or even suggesting that\r\njuvenile proceedings ought  to be  open.  We  are merely  holding\r\nthat the Act does not invariably require them to be closed.\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\n          As  an  initial  matter,   we  note  that  the  Globe's\r\n\narguments  on  this point  seem to  rest  on the  assumption that\r\n\njuvenile  proceedings  should  be  open  as  a  rule,   and  only\r\n\ncompelling interests  justify  closure.   Certainly,  a  district\r\n\ncourt must  exercise its discretion soundly,  and must articulate\r\n\nreasons which are supported by the record and in keeping with the\r\n\npolicies of the Act.  Contrary to the Globe's implied assumption,\r\n\nhowever,  the language  and policy  of the  Act, as  well as  the\r\n\nhistory of juvenile justice proceedings  in this country over the\r\n\npast century, indicate that a court's exercise of its  discretion\r\n\nto close juvenile proceedings is not an exception to some general\r\n\nrule of openness, but the norm.\r\n\n          The  district court's  findings here  were meticulously\r\n\nspecific.  The court first correctly noted  the Act's overarching\r\n\nobjective  of  protecting  juveniles  from  stigma  in  order  to\r\n\nfacilitate rehabilitation.  862 F. Supp. at 657.  The court found\r\n\nthat    these   juveniles    were   particularly    amenable   to\r\n\nrehabilitation, based  on the  prosecutor's decision not  to seek\r\n\ntransfer to  adult status and the  clean prior records of  two of\r\n\nthe juveniles.  Id.   The district court also gave weight  to the\r                            \r\n\njuveniles' opposition to open  proceedings, noting that the media\r\n\nhad already  subjected the youths to  overwhelming publicity, and\r\n\nconcluding that adequate protection  of the juveniles from stigma\r\n\nand public  scrutiny would  be impossible unless  the proceedings\r\n\nwere closed.  Id.\r                          \r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\n          The  Globe  contends that  the  court  should not  have\r\n\nrelied upon  the opposition of  the juveniles themselves  to open\r\n\nproceedings,  as such  a  wish is  \"unremarkable\"  and \"does  not\r\n\nsuggest that  this case  involves any individualized  concern for\r\n\nclosure different from those  present in virtually every juvenile\r\n\nproceeding.\"   As the government points  out, however, protection\r\n\nof  the  accused  is  one  of the  strongest  justifications  for\r\n\nallowing public  access  to the  proceeding.   When  the  accused\r\n\njuvenile,  on  advice of  counsel,  opposes  public access,  this\r\n\njustification  is  vitiated.     Further,   the  juveniles'   own\r\n\nassessment of their  interests is a highly  reliable indicator of\r\n\nwhether they will be irreparably stigmatized by open proceedings.\r\n\nGiven the Act's  strong policy in  favor of protecting  juveniles\r\n\nfrom such  stigma,  we think  the juveniles'  opposition to  open\r\n\nproceedings  was a  relevant  factor for  the  district court  to\r\n\nconsider.\r\n\n          The Globe also attempts to downplay the significance of\r\n\nthe  fact that the juveniles  had not been  transferred for adult\r\n\nprosecution.  The prosecutors'  determination not to transfer the\r\n\njuveniles is based on an evaluation of criteria set forth  by the\r\n\nAct, including the age and social background of the juvenile, the\r\n\nnature of the alleged offense, the extent of the juvenile's prior\r\n\nrecord, and  the juvenile's present intellectual  development and\r\n\npsychological maturity.  18  U.S.C.   5032.  Because all of these\r\n\ncriteria are highly significant  indicators of the amenability of\r\n\nthe  juvenile to rehabilitation,  they are also  very relevant to\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\nthe court's decision whether to close the proceedings.  By taking\r\n\nthe prosecutors' decision into consideration, then, the court was\r\n\nalso giving weight  to these  factors.  That  these factors  will\r\n\noften  militate in favor of  closure in juvenile proceedings does\r\n\nnot  in  any  way diminish  their  relevance  or  weight; to  the\r\n\ncontrary, it  merely underscores the Act's  strong preference for\r\n\npreserving the confidentiality of juvenile records.7\r\n\n          The Globe also contends that the district court's order\r\n\ndoes not effectively serve its  intended interests, as nothing in\r\n\nthe  court's  opinion  indicates  that  the  closure  order  will\r\n\n\"effectively  preserve the juveniles'  confidentiality.\"   In its\r\n\nopinion, the district court recognized that media coverage of the\r\n\nproceedings had already been extensive, that one of the juveniles\r\n\nhad already been interviewed, that the juveniles had already been\r\n\nidentified  several  times in  the press,  and  that many  of the\r\n\ndetails  of  their alleged  conduct  had  already been  disclosed\r\n\nthrough the related  adult criminal prosecution of Clayton.   862\r\n\nF. Supp. at 659.   The Globe now points to these facts and argues\r\n\nthat because all this  information had already been aired  in the\r\n\npress,  \"whatever stigma  the juveniles  may acquire  will attach\r\n\neven  if the press is excluded from the proceedings.\"  Therefore,\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n7    The  Globe also  suggests  that the  heinous  nature  of the\r\njuveniles'  alleged  conduct  augments  the  public  interest  in\r\n\"seeing  justice  done,\"  and  therefore   supports  opening  the\r\nproceedings.    Given  the  Act's policy  of  preventing  stigma,\r\nhowever, this argument is completely misguided.   It is precisely\r\nbecause  the alleged crimes have provoked  so much public outrage\r                 \r\nand  antipathy that closure becomes more appropriate, in order to\r\nbest effectuate the Act's purpose.\r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\naccording  to the  Globe,  because the  district court's  closure\r\n\norder cannot  possibly preserve  the juveniles' anonymity,  it is\r\n\nineffective, and cannot stand.\r\n\n          This is  a  flawed, circular  argument with  disturbing\r\n\nramifications.   Essentially, the  Globe is arguing  that because\r\n\nthe press  has already  obtained and published  some information,\r                                                              \r\n\nany  further   attempts  by   the  district  court   to  preserve\r\n\nconfidentiality are either futile or irrelevant.  Contrary to the\r\n\nGlobe's  contention, the  fact  that the  juveniles have  already\r\n\nsuffered  stigma does  not justify removing  or denying  them all\r\n\nfurther  protections created by the Act.  Moreover, we agree with\r\n\nthe  government that  to  allow the  media to  \"leverage\" partial\r\n\ninformation  into  an unfettered  right  of  access to  otherwise\r\n\nnonpublic proceedings  would grant the media  a dangerous control\r\n\nover important  state interests.  We therefore reject the Globe's\r\n\ncontentions on this  point, and  hold that  the district  court's\r\n\nclosure  order  sufficiently   serves  its   stated  purpose   of\r\n\npreserving what confidentiality remains of the proceedings.\r\n\n          The Globe also argues that the district court's closure\r\n\norder is  not \"narrowly  tailored.\"   Because the  district court\r\n\ncould have effected its intended purpose through less restrictive\r\n\nmeans,  such  as  using   pseudonyms  and  redacting  identifying\r\n\ninformation from  proceedings and records, the  Globe argues, its\r\n\ntotal ban on public  access was unwarranted.  Again, we note that\r\n\nthe  Globe  is relying  on the  dubious assumption  that district\r\n\ncourts  must   meet  the  extremely   stringent  First  Amendment\r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\nstandards  applied to  adult criminal cases  in order  to justify\r\n\nclosure of juvenile proceedings.\r\n\n          Even  assuming,   however,  that  such   standards  are\r\n\napplicable  here, we find that  they are sufficiently  met by the\r\n\ncourt's  order.  As the  district court recognized,  it could not\r\n\nbar the  media from publishing information legally obtained.  862\r\n\nF. Supp. at 657 (citing  Smith v. Daily Mail Publishing  Co., 443\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. 97  (1979)).  Because it had no way of ensuring that certain\r\n\nidentifying   information  would   remain  confidential   if  the\r\n\nproceedings were open to  the press, the court concluded  that it\r\n\nhad no  less restrictive alternative to  closing the proceedings.\r\n\nId.  We  think this reasoning is quite sound.   The identities of\r            \r\n\nthe  juveniles had already been  widely publicized.  Redaction of\r\n\nthe juveniles' names from the  proceedings as the Globe  suggests\r\n\nwould   therefore   have   been    an   exercise   in   futility.\r\n\nRealistically, the  press would merely publish  detailed accounts\r\n\nof  the  \"redacted\"  proceedings,  substituting  the  identifying\r\n\ninformation  previously obtained.   In  short, redaction,  or any\r\n\nother  compromise   measure,  would  have   been  ineffective  in\r\n\npreserving the confidentiality of the proceedings.8\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n8  We  likewise reject  the Globe's arguments  that the  district\r\ncourt's order impermissibly infringes  the public right of access\r\nto  court records by shifting the burden of obtaining access onto\r\nthe  public.   Rather than  sealing the  case file  and requiring\r\ninterested  parties to  move for  further disclosures,  the Globe\r\nsuggests,  the  court  should have  done  just  the  opposite and\r\nrequired  trial counsel  to  move for  impoundment of  particular\r\ndocuments.  This contention is yet another example of the Globe's\r\nattempt to  force juvenile  proceedings into the  First Amendment\r\nframework  developed for  adult  criminal proceedings.    Section\r\n5038(a)  of  the  Act  specifically provides  that  throughout  a\r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\n          Finally, the  Globe contends that the  district court's\r\n\norder  violates  the  public's  common law  right  of  access  to\r\n\nproceedings and records.  It is true that \"courts of this country\r\n\nrecognize a general right  to inspect . . .  judicial records and\r\n\ndocuments.\"  Nixon v. Warner Communications, Inc.,  435 U.S. 589,\r                                                           \r\n\n597  (1978).  The Supreme Court has explained, however, that this\r\n\nright is  not absolute; rather, the decision as to such access is\r\n\n\"best  left to  the  sound  discretion  of  the  trial  court,  a\r\n\ndiscretion to be  exercised in  light of the  relevant facts  and\r\n\ncircumstances  of the particular case.\"  Id. at 598-99.  Assuming\r                                                     \r\n\nthat  this common law right  of access applies  to juvenile court\r\n\nrecords,9  we do not think  that the district  court's order here\r\n\nimproperly  infringes  on this  right.    In  this  context,  the\r\n\nqualified common  law  right of  access to  proceedings has  been\r\n\nsupplanted by the statutory  scheme of the Act.   As we interpret\r\n\nthem,  however,  the  Act's  confidentiality  provisions  do  not\r\n\nsignificantly alter or restrict that common law right in any way,\r\n\nbut  leave public access to the sound discretion of trial courts.\r\n\nBecause  the  district  court's  order fully  comports  with  the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\njuvenile   delinquency   proceeding,   \"the  records   shall   be\r\nsafeguarded from disclosure to unauthorized persons.\"  As we have\r\nexplained, this section grants  the district court the discretion\r\nto  release  juvenile  records  as it  deems  appropriate.    The\r\ndistrict court's order here  meticulously tracks this language of\r\nthe Act, and  we therefore  find that its  method of  determining\r\npublic access to court records is entirely proper.\r\n\n9   It  is not  altogether clear  that this  common law  right of\r\naccess applies to juvenile  court records, in light of  the long,\r\nsound  tradition of  preserving  the confidentiality  of juvenile\r\nproceedings.  See supra note 4.\r                                 \r\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\nprovisions of  the  Act and  is  thus a  proper  exercise of  its\r\n\ndiscretion,  the order  cannot be  said to  infringe on  any pre-\r\n\nexisting common law  right of  access.  We  therefore reject  the\r\n\nGlobe's arguments on this point.\r\n\n                               VI.\r                                         VI.\r\n\n          In sum, we hold  that the Act authorizes, but  does not\r\n\nmandate,  the  closure of  juvenile  proceedings.   The  district\r\n\ncourt's closure order was  fully justified on the record  and was\r\n\ntherefore an entirely proper exercise of its discretion under the\r\n\nAct.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                            \r\n\n                               -23-\r\r\n",

We\r\n\nhold  that the Act authorizes,  but does not  mandate, closure of\r\n\njuvenile  proceedings.   Although we  disagree with  the district\r\n\ncourt's interpretation of the  statute, we nevertheless find that\r\n\nthe  court's  decision to  close the  proceedings was  within its\r\n\ndiscretion and proper under the Act.\r\n\n                                I.\r                                          I.\r\n\n          On  July  19,   1994,  the  government  charged   three\r\n\njuveniles with civil rights violations under the Federal Juvenile\r\n\nDelinquency Act (the \"Act\"), 18 U.S.C.    5031-5042.  The charges\r\n\ninvolved \"hate  crimes\" allegedly  committed by the  juveniles as\r\n\nmembers of a white supremacist  group.  On the same day  that the\r\n\njuveniles were charged, the  grand jury indicted an adult,  Brian\r\n\nClayton,  with  violations  of 18  U.S.C.     241 (conspiracy  to\r\n\nviolate civil  rights) and    371 (conspiracy  to intimidate  and\r\n\ninterfere  with  federally  protected  activities  on account  of\r\n\nrace).    The indictment  charges  that  Clayton committed  these\r\n\nviolations as a  member of  the same white  supremacist group  to\r\n\nwhich the three juveniles allegedly belonged.\r\n\n          Just prior  to the juveniles' arraignments  on July 20,\r\n\n1994, intervenor-appellant Globe Newspaper Company  (the \"Globe\")\r\n\nmoved to  intervene in the  juvenile proceedings for  purposes of\r\n\ngaining access to the arraignments and subsequent proceedings, as\r\n\nwell  as to any judicial documents filed in connection with those\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nproceedings.   The district court allowed the  Globe to intervene\r\n\nand granted  it access to  certain redacted court  documents, but\r\n\ndenied  public access to the  arraignments on the  grounds that  \r\n\n5038  of the  Act mandated  closure of  the proceedings.

The court alternatively held  that, even if\r\n\nclosure  were discretionary,  it would  close the  proceedings in\r\n\nthis case.  See id. at 658.  The Globe argues on appeal  that the\r                            \r\n\nFirst   Amendment  creates   a  right   of  access   to  juvenile\r\n\nproceedings, that  the district  court erred by  interpreting the\r\n\nAct  to mandate  closure of  juvenile proceedings,  and that  the\r\n\nfactors set forth and  relied upon by  the district court in  its\r\n\nopinion are not sufficiently compelling to justify closure of the\r\n\nproceedings.\r\n\n                               II.\r                                         II.\r\n\n          The  issues  presented  by   this  appeal  involve  the\r\n\ninterpretation and constitutionality of certain provisions of the\r\n\nAct.

In  a  very instructive  case,\r                    \r\n\nhowever, the Court addressed whether the First Amendment allows a\r\n\nstatutory bar  to public access  to adult criminal  trials during\r\n\nthe  testimony of sex-offense victims who are minors.  See Globe,\r                                                                          \r\n\n457 U.S. at  607.   Although the Supreme  Court acknowledged  the\r\n\ncompelling state interests of protecting the victims from further\r\n\ntrauma and  embarrassment and  encouraging other victims  to come\r\n\nforward, it  held that neither interest  sufficiently justified a\r\n\nblanket closure  in every  case involving a  youthful sex-offense\r\n\nvictim.  Id. at 607.  The Court explained:\r                     \r\n\n            [A]s  compelling  as  that  interest  [in\r\n            protecting the minor victims] is, it does\r\n            not justify a mandatory closure rule, for\r                                             \r\n            it is clear that the circumstances of the\r\n            particular    case    may   affect    the\r\n            significance  of the  interest.   A trial\r\n            court  can  determine  on a  case-by-case\r\n            basis  whether  closure  is necessary  to\r\n            protect   the   welfare   of    a   minor\r\n            victim. . . .  Section 16A,  in contrast,\r\n            requires  closure even if the victim does\r\n            not seek the  exclusion of the  press and\r\n            general  public,  and  would  not  suffer\r\n            injury  by  their presence.  .  .  .   In\r\n            short,     16A  cannot  be  viewed  as  a\r\n            narrowly tailored  means of accommodating\r\n            the  State's  asserted  interest:    That\r\n            interest could be served  just as well by\r\n            requiring the trial court to determine on\r\n            a case-by-case basis whether  the State's\r\n            legitimate concern for the  well-being of\r\n            the  minor  victim necessitates  closure.\r\n            Such   an   approach  ensures   that  the\r\n            constitutional right of the press and the\r\n            public to gain access to  criminal trials\r\n            will  not  be  restricted   except  where\r\n            necessary   to    protect   the   State's\r\n            interest.\r\n\nId.

Relying on the Court's language in Globe, 457 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\nat  607-08, 611,  the  Globe contends  that the  district court's\r\n\nconstruction  of  the  Act   as  imposing  \"a  mandatory  closure\r\n\nrequirement  on  all  juvenile   proceedings\"  renders  the   Act\r\n\nunconstitutional.

The  Globe  contends,\r\n\nconversely, that the Act's language does not mandate closure, but\r\n\nleaves  the decision to  the district  court's discretion,  to be\r\n\ndetermined  on a case-by-case basis.  In so contending, the Globe\r\n\nrelies  heavily on   PG Publishing,  28 F.3d  at 1359-60,  and we\r                                            \r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nagree  that the Third Circuit's  reasoning in that  case is quite\r\n\npersuasive.\r\n\n          As the  district court  acknowledged, the Act  does not\r\n\nexpressly  require a  closed hearing  for a  juvenile proceeding.\r\n\n862  F. Supp.  at 655.   Section  5032 of  the Act  provides that\r\n\njuvenile  proceedings may  be  convened \"at  any  time and  place\r\n\nwithin  the  district, in  chambers or  otherwise.\"   This phrase\r\n\ncertainly seems  to contemplate  that district court  judges will\r\n\nexercise their discretion  to determine when, where,  and in what\r\n\nmanner  juvenile proceedings  will  be conducted.   Moreover,  we\r\n\nagree  with the Third Circuit  that the language  \"in chambers or\r\n\notherwise\" strongly implies that the district court's  discretion\r\n\nincludes  \"a decision  regarding the  availability and  degree of\r\n\npublic access.\"  PG Publishing, 28 F.3d at 1359.  This section of\r                                        \r\n\nthe Act  therefore provides  \"strong evidence\" that  Congress did\r\n\nnot  intend mandatory  closure of  all juvenile  proceedings, but\r\n\nrather left the question of public access to the district court's\r\n\ndiscretion.  Id.\r                         \r\n\n          The first paragraph of   5038(a) of the Act states that\r\n\n\"the records  [of any  juvenile proceeding] shall  be safeguarded\r\n\nfrom  disclosure  to unauthorized  persons.\"    Pointing to  this\r\n\nprovision,  the  government  contends  that  the  Act  explicitly\r\n\nprohibits disclosure  of juvenile records except  to the entities\r\n\nenumerated  in  subsequent paragraphs,  and  that  this evidences\r\n\nCongressional  intent  to  create  an  across-the-board   ban  on\r\n\ndisclosure  to any  and  all other  parties.   We  do  not think,\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nhowever, that  this language is quite so  conclusive; the section\r\n\ndoes not explicitly  mandate denial of public  access to juvenile\r                                      \r\n\nrecords,  but   provides  only  that   the  records  are   to  be\r\n\n\"safeguarded  from disclosure to  unauthorized persons.\"   Giving\r                                                        \r\n\nthis  phrase a less strained, more common sense reading, we think\r\n\nthat the section prohibits  disclosure only to those persons  not\r\n\nauthorized  by the  district court  to receive  such information.\r                                            \r\n\nSee   PG  Publishing,  28   F.3d  at  1359   (reaching  the  same\r                              \r\n\nconclusion).   The only express prohibitive  mandate contained in\r\n\nall  of   5038(a) rests  in the final  paragraph, which prohibits\r\n\nthe district  court  from authorizing  disclosure  in  situations\r\n\n\"when the  request for information  is related to  an application\r\n\nfor  employment,   license,  bonding   or  any  civil   right  or\r\n\nprivilege.\"\r\n\n          Nor  do  we  think   that  the  parties  enumerated  in\r\n\nparagraphs  (a)(1)  through  (a)(6)  of     5038  constitute  the\r\n\nexclusive  list of persons  intended by Congress  to ever receive\r\n\ninformation  about juvenile proceedings.   Rather, the paragraphs\r\n\nmerely list those  persons who  have a right  to obtain  juvenile\r\n\nrecords  upon  request.   Indeed,  if this  were  meant to  be an\r\n\nexclusive  list,   then  the  final  paragraph   of  the  section\r\n\n(prohibiting  disclosure  when  the   information  is  sought  in\r\n\nrelation  to a job application,  etc.) would be  superfluous.  PG\r                                                                           \r\n\nPublishing, 28  F.3d at 1360.   Read as  a whole, then,  we think\r                    \r\n\nthat    5038(a) further  evidences Congressional intent  to leave\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\ndisclosure  of  juvenile  records  within  the  district  court's\r\n\ndiscretion.5\r\n\n          The only section of the Act that suggests that Congress\r\n\nintended  an across-the-board bar to  public access is   5038(e),\r\n\nwhich provides that \"neither the name nor picture of any juvenile\r\n\nshall be  made public in  connection with a  juvenile delinquency\r\n\nproceeding.\"   The  district court  reasoned that  if it  were to\r\n\npermit  public access  to the  proceedings, the  juveniles' names\r\n\nwould  certainly,   unavoidably,  be   made  public,   in  direct\r\n\ncontravention of   5038(e).  862 F. Supp. at 655.  Because it saw\r\n\nno  way to  obey the  letter of    5038(e)  short of  closing the\r\n\nproceedings, the  district court  interpreted the Act  to mandate\r\n\nclosure.   Id. at 655-56.  The  government now urges us to affirm\r                       \r\n\nthis interpretation, arguing that  any other reading would render\r\n\nthe confidentiality provisions a nullity.\r\n\n          On this point, however, we are  persuaded once again by\r\n\nthe reasoning of the PG Publishing court, which explained:\r                                            \r\n\n            A prohibition against making a juvenile's\r\n            name or picture available to  the public,\r\n            however,  strikes us  as an  indirect and\r\n            unlikely  way  for Congress  to stipulate\r\n            that all hearings  under the Act  will be\r\n            closed  to  the public.    State statutes\r\n            that   restrict    access   to   juvenile\r\n            proceedings generally do so  directly and\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n5    The  language  of     5038(c)  does  not  conflict  with our\r\ninterpretation.   This section provides that  all information and\r\nrecords  relating  to  the  proceeding \"shall  not  be  disclosed\r\ndirectly or  indirectly to anyone  other than the  judge, counsel\r\nfor the juvenile  and the  Government, or  others entitled  under\r                                                                           \r\nthis section to receive juvenile records.\"  (Emphasis added).  We\r                                                  \r\nread the underlined  phrase to mean any other  persons authorized\r\nby the court to receive information under   5038(a).\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\n            clearly. . . .   We  think  it  far  more\r\n            likely that   5038(e) was intended not to\r\n            limit  the discretion of  trial judges to\r\n            regulate  access to  juvenile delinquency\r\n            proceedings,   but   to   foreclose   law\r\n            enforcement officials  from holding press\r\n            conferences at which the name and picture\r\n            of the juvenile would  be \"made public in\r\n            connection  with  a juvenile  delinquency\r\n            proceeding.\"\r\n\n28 F.3d at 1360-61 (quoting 18 U.S.C.   5038(e)).  Certainly,  if\r\n\nCongress intended to mandate closure of all juvenile proceedings,\r\n\nit  could have done  so expressly  and directly.   Cf.,  e.g., 18\r                                                                       \r\n\nU.S.C.    3509(e) (authorizing \"the exclusion  from the courtroom\r\n\nof all persons, including members of the press, who do not have a\r\n\ndirect  interest  in  the case\"  during  the  testimony of  child\r\n\nwitnesses).\r\n\n          We  also  agree  with  the   Globe  that  even  if  the\r\n\nprohibition  on  disclosure  of  a juvenile's  name  and  picture\r\n\nprevents  unfettered public  access to  proceedings, it  does not\r\n\nnecessarily follow  that   5038(e)  commands total closure.   The\r\n\nstatutory directive can  in many instances be satisfied by other,\r\n\nless restrictive means.  For example, public access to records or\r\n\nproceedings  poses  no  risk  of  disclosure  of  the  juvenile's\r\n\npicture,  as cameras can be banned from the proceedings and names\r\n\nredacted from documents.   Similarly, there are methods  short of\r\n\ncomplete closure, such as the use of initials or pseudonyms, that\r\n\nwould  protect against  inadvertent disclosure of  the juveniles'\r\n\nnames.\r\n\n          Finally, we  think that interpreting the  entire Act in\r\n\nlight  of    5038(e), rather  than vice  versa,  attributes undue\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\nsignificance to that section.  To hold that the Act must  mandate\r\n\nclosure  because of    5038(e)  is effectively  to ignore  strong\r\n\nindicia  elsewhere in the statute that Congress did not intend to\r\n\ncreate a blanket prohibition on public access, but rather to vest\r\n\ndiscretion with the district courts  to fashion proceedings in  a\r\n\nmanner most appropriate for each individual case.\r\n\n          For  these  reasons,  we hold  that  the  Act does  not\r\n\nmandate  across-the-board closure  for all  juvenile proceedings,\r\n\nbut merely authorizes closure, or  any other measures designed to\r\n\nensure confidentiality, to be  determined on a case-by-case basis\r\n\nat the discretion  of the district  court.6   We think that  this\r\n\ninterpretation fully  comports with  the purpose and  language of\r\n\nthe  statute as  a whole,  and is  far preferable  to  a strained\r\n\nconstruction of the Act that  mandates complete closure and  thus\r\n\ntriggers First Amendment concerns.\r\n\n                                V.\r                                          V.\r\n\n          We turn now to the Globe's final contentions on appeal,\r\n\nnamely, that the district court's articulated reasons for closing\r\n\nthe  proceedings are  not  \"sufficiently compelling\"  to  justify\r\n\nclosure in this case, that the court's order does not effectively\r\n\nserve its intended interests, and that the order is not \"narrowly\r\n\ntailored.\"  The Globe offers several theories in support of these\r\n\ncontentions, none of which we find persuasive.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n6  We  emphasize that we are not holding  or even suggesting that\r\njuvenile proceedings ought  to be  open.  We  are merely  holding\r\nthat the Act does not invariably require them to be closed.\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\n          As  an  initial  matter,   we  note  that  the  Globe's\r\n\narguments  on  this point  seem to  rest  on the  assumption that\r\n\njuvenile  proceedings  should  be  open  as  a  rule,   and  only\r\n\ncompelling interests  justify  closure.   Certainly,  a  district\r\n\ncourt must  exercise its discretion soundly,  and must articulate\r\n\nreasons which are supported by the record and in keeping with the\r\n\npolicies of the Act.  Contrary to the Globe's implied assumption,\r\n\nhowever,  the language  and policy  of the  Act, as  well as  the\r\n\nhistory of juvenile justice proceedings  in this country over the\r\n\npast century, indicate that a court's exercise of its  discretion\r\n\nto close juvenile proceedings is not an exception to some general\r\n\nrule of openness, but the norm.\r\n\n          The  district court's  findings here  were meticulously\r\n\nspecific.  The court first correctly noted  the Act's overarching\r\n\nobjective  of  protecting  juveniles  from  stigma  in  order  to\r\n\nfacilitate rehabilitation.  862 F. Supp. at 657.  The court found\r\n\nthat    these   juveniles    were   particularly    amenable   to\r\n\nrehabilitation, based  on the  prosecutor's decision not  to seek\r\n\ntransfer to  adult status and the  clean prior records of  two of\r\n\nthe juveniles.  Id.   The district court also gave weight  to the\r                            \r\n\njuveniles' opposition to open  proceedings, noting that the media\r\n\nhad already  subjected the youths to  overwhelming publicity, and\r\n\nconcluding that adequate protection  of the juveniles from stigma\r\n\nand public  scrutiny would  be impossible unless  the proceedings\r\n\nwere closed.  Id.\r                          \r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\n          The  Globe  contends that  the  court  should not  have\r\n\nrelied upon  the opposition of  the juveniles themselves  to open\r\n\nproceedings,  as such  a  wish is  \"unremarkable\"  and \"does  not\r\n\nsuggest that  this case  involves any individualized  concern for\r\n\nclosure different from those  present in virtually every juvenile\r\n\nproceeding.\"   As the government points  out, however, protection\r\n\nof  the  accused  is  one  of the  strongest  justifications  for\r\n\nallowing public  access  to the  proceeding.   When  the  accused\r\n\njuvenile,  on  advice of  counsel,  opposes  public access,  this\r\n\njustification  is  vitiated.     Further,   the  juveniles'   own\r\n\nassessment of their  interests is a highly  reliable indicator of\r\n\nwhether they will be irreparably stigmatized by open proceedings.\r\n\nGiven the Act's  strong policy in  favor of protecting  juveniles\r\n\nfrom such  stigma,  we think  the juveniles'  opposition to  open\r\n\nproceedings  was a  relevant  factor for  the  district court  to\r\n\nconsider.\r\n\n          The Globe also attempts to downplay the significance of\r\n\nthe  fact that the juveniles  had not been  transferred for adult\r\n\nprosecution.  The prosecutors'  determination not to transfer the\r\n\njuveniles is based on an evaluation of criteria set forth  by the\r\n\nAct, including the age and social background of the juvenile, the\r\n\nnature of the alleged offense, the extent of the juvenile's prior\r\n\nrecord, and  the juvenile's present intellectual  development and\r\n\npsychological maturity.  18  U.S.C.   5032.  Because all of these\r\n\ncriteria are highly significant  indicators of the amenability of\r\n\nthe  juvenile to rehabilitation,  they are also  very relevant to\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\nthe court's decision whether to close the proceedings.  By taking\r\n\nthe prosecutors' decision into consideration, then, the court was\r\n\nalso giving weight  to these  factors.  That  these factors  will\r\n\noften  militate in favor of  closure in juvenile proceedings does\r\n\nnot  in  any  way diminish  their  relevance  or  weight; to  the\r\n\ncontrary, it  merely underscores the Act's  strong preference for\r\n\npreserving the confidentiality of juvenile records.7\r\n\n          The Globe also contends that the district court's order\r\n\ndoes not effectively serve its  intended interests, as nothing in\r\n\nthe  court's  opinion  indicates  that  the  closure  order  will\r\n\n\"effectively  preserve the juveniles'  confidentiality.\"   In its\r\n\nopinion, the district court recognized that media coverage of the\r\n\nproceedings had already been extensive, that one of the juveniles\r\n\nhad already been interviewed, that the juveniles had already been\r\n\nidentified  several  times in  the press,  and  that many  of the\r\n\ndetails  of  their alleged  conduct  had  already been  disclosed\r\n\nthrough the related  adult criminal prosecution of Clayton.   862\r\n\nF. Supp. at 659.   The Globe now points to these facts and argues\r\n\nthat because all this  information had already been aired  in the\r\n\npress,  \"whatever stigma  the juveniles  may acquire  will attach\r\n\neven  if the press is excluded from the proceedings.\"  Therefore,\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n7    The  Globe also  suggests  that the  heinous  nature  of the\r\njuveniles'  alleged  conduct  augments  the  public  interest  in\r\n\"seeing  justice  done,\"  and  therefore   supports  opening  the\r\nproceedings.    Given  the  Act's policy  of  preventing  stigma,\r\nhowever, this argument is completely misguided.   It is precisely\r\nbecause  the alleged crimes have provoked  so much public outrage\r                 \r\nand  antipathy that closure becomes more appropriate, in order to\r\nbest effectuate the Act's purpose.\r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\naccording  to the  Globe,  because the  district court's  closure\r\n\norder cannot  possibly preserve  the juveniles' anonymity,  it is\r\n\nineffective, and cannot stand.\r\n\n          This is  a  flawed, circular  argument with  disturbing\r\n\nramifications.   Essentially, the  Globe is arguing  that because\r\n\nthe press  has already  obtained and published  some information,\r                                                              \r\n\nany  further   attempts  by   the  district  court   to  preserve\r\n\nconfidentiality are either futile or irrelevant.  Contrary to the\r\n\nGlobe's  contention, the  fact  that the  juveniles have  already\r\n\nsuffered  stigma does  not justify removing  or denying  them all\r\n\nfurther  protections created by the Act.  Moreover, we agree with\r\n\nthe  government that  to  allow the  media to  \"leverage\" partial\r\n\ninformation  into  an unfettered  right  of  access to  otherwise\r\n\nnonpublic proceedings  would grant the media  a dangerous control\r\n\nover important  state interests.  We therefore reject the Globe's\r\n\ncontentions on this  point, and  hold that  the district  court's\r\n\nclosure  order  sufficiently   serves  its   stated  purpose   of\r\n\npreserving what confidentiality remains of the proceedings.\r\n\n          The Globe also argues that the district court's closure\r\n\norder is  not \"narrowly  tailored.\"   Because the  district court\r\n\ncould have effected its intended purpose through less restrictive\r\n\nmeans,  such  as  using   pseudonyms  and  redacting  identifying\r\n\ninformation from  proceedings and records, the  Globe argues, its\r\n\ntotal ban on public  access was unwarranted.  Again, we note that\r\n\nthe  Globe  is relying  on the  dubious assumption  that district\r\n\ncourts  must   meet  the  extremely   stringent  First  Amendment\r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\nstandards  applied to  adult criminal cases  in order  to justify\r\n\nclosure of juvenile proceedings.\r\n\n          Even  assuming,   however,  that  such   standards  are\r\n\napplicable  here, we find that  they are sufficiently  met by the\r\n\ncourt's  order.  As the  district court recognized,  it could not\r\n\nbar the  media from publishing information legally obtained.  862\r\n\nF. Supp. at 657 (citing  Smith v. Daily Mail Publishing  Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2452958\"><a href=\"/opinion/2452958/smith-v-daily-mail-publishing-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span>\r                                                                      \r\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">  (1979)).  Because it had no way of ensuring that certain\r\n\nidentifying   information  would   remain  confidential   if  the\r\n\nproceedings were open to  the press, the court concluded  that it\r\n\nhad no  less restrictive alternative to  closing the proceedings.\r\n\nId.  We  think this reasoning is quite sound.   The identities of\r            \r\n\nthe  juveniles had already been  widely publicized.  Redaction of\r\n\nthe juveniles' names from the  proceedings as the Globe  suggests\r\n\nwould   therefore   have   been    an   exercise   in   futility.\r\n\nRealistically, the  press would merely publish  detailed accounts\r\n\nof  the  \"redacted\"  proceedings,  substituting  the  identifying\r\n\ninformation  previously obtained.   In  short, redaction,  or any\r\n\nother  compromise   measure,  would  have   been  ineffective  in\r\n\npreserving the confidentiality of the proceedings.8\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n8  We  likewise reject  the Globe's arguments  that the  district\r\ncourt's order impermissibly infringes  the public right of access\r\nto  court records by shifting the burden of obtaining access onto\r\nthe  public.   Rather than  sealing the  case file  and requiring\r\ninterested  parties to  move for  further disclosures,  the Globe\r\nsuggests,  the  court  should have  done  just  the  opposite and\r\nrequired  trial counsel  to  move for  impoundment of  particular\r\ndocuments.  This contention is yet another example of the Globe's\r\nattempt to  force juvenile  proceedings into the  First Amendment\r\nframework  developed for  adult  criminal proceedings.    Section\r\n5038(a)  of  the  Act  specifically provides  that  throughout  a\r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\n          Finally, the  Globe contends that the  district court's\r\n\norder  violates  the  public's  common law  right  of  access  to\r\n\nproceedings and records.  It is true that \"courts of this country\r\n\nrecognize a general right  to inspect . . .  judicial records and\r\n\ndocuments.\"  Nixon v. Warner Communications, Inc.,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109830\"><a href=\"/opinion/109830/nixon-v-warner-communications-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">589</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r                                                           \r\n\n597  (1978).  The Supreme Court has explained, however, that this\r\n\nright is  not absolute; rather, the decision as to such access is\r\n\n\"best  left to  the  sound  discretion  of  the  trial  court,  a\r\n\ndiscretion to be  exercised in  light of the  relevant facts  and\r\n\ncircumstances  of the particular case.\"  Id. at 598-99.  Assuming\r                                                     \r\n\nthat  this common law right  of access applies  to juvenile court\r\n\nrecords,9  we do not think  that the district  court's order here\r\n\nimproperly  infringes  on this  right.    In  this  context,  the\r\n\nqualified common  law  right of  access to  proceedings has  been\r\n\nsupplanted by the statutory  scheme of the Act.   As we interpret\r\n\nthem,  however,  the  Act's  confidentiality  provisions  do  not\r\n\nsignificantly alter or restrict that common law right in any way,\r\n\nbut  leave public access to the sound discretion of trial courts.\r\n\nBecause  the  district  court's  order fully  comports  with  the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\njuvenile   delinquency   proceeding,   \"the  records   shall   be\r\nsafeguarded from disclosure to unauthorized persons.\"  As we have\r\nexplained, this section grants  the district court the discretion\r\nto  release  juvenile  records  as it  deems  appropriate.    The\r\ndistrict court's order here  meticulously tracks this language of\r\nthe Act, and  we therefore  find that its  method of  determining\r\npublic access to court records is entirely proper.\r\n\n9   It  is not  altogether clear  that this  common law  right of\r\naccess applies to juvenile  court records, in light of  the long,\r\nsound  tradition of  preserving  the confidentiality  of juvenile\r\nproceedings.  See supra note 4.\r                                 \r\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\nprovisions of  the  Act and  is  thus a  proper  exercise of  its\r\n\ndiscretion,  the order  cannot be  said to  infringe on  any pre-\r\n\nexisting common law  right of  access.  We  therefore reject  the\r\n\nGlobe's arguments on this point.\r\n\n                               VI.\r                                         VI.\r\n\n          In sum, we hold  that the Act authorizes, but  does not\r\n\nmandate,  the  closure of  juvenile  proceedings.   The  district\r\n\ncourt's closure order was  fully justified on the record  and was\r\n\ntherefore an entirely proper exercise of its discretion under the\r\n\nAct.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                            \r\n\n                               -23-\r\r\n</pre>",
