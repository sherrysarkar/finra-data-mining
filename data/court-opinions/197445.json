Plaintiff-appellant Bruce King\r                    TORRUELLA, Chief Judge.\r                                          \r\n\n(\"King\")  worked  for  the  Hanover Department  of  Public  Works\r\n\n(\"DPW\") as a heavy equipment operator and truck driver.  King was\r\n\nsupervised  by  Leo  Hamill  (\"Hamill\") from  July  1991  onward.\r\n\nHamill's immediate supervisor was  Richard Hauger (\"Hauger\").  In\r\n\nMarch  1993, Hauger  informed King  that he  had decided  to take\r\n\ndisciplinary action for  incidents in which  King was alleged  to\r\n\nhave  destroyed town property.   King was suspended  for one week\r\n\nwithout  pay  and placed  on probation  for  ninety days.   After\r\n\nreceiving notice  of the suspension and  probation, plaintiff did\r\n\nnot return to work.\r\n\n          In May 1993, King exercised his right, under  the DPW's\r\n\npersonnel policy manual, to appeal the disciplinary action to the\r\n\nTown  Manager.    A  hearing was  scheduled  for  May  26.   King\r\n\nrequested that the hearing  be open to the public,  that the Town\r\n\nproduce certain witnesses  to testify, that  the Town record  the\r\n\nhearing or  permit a court  reporter to do so  at King's expense,\r\n\nand  that the  town manager,  defendant Clifford  Vermiya, excuse\r\n\nhimself  from the  proceedings based on  a conflict  of interest.\r\n\nWhen  all  of  these requests  were  denied,  King  chose not  to\r\n\nparticipate.\r\n\n          On July 21,  1993, King filed a  bill of equity in  the\r\n\nGrafton County  Superior Court  seeking reinstatement,  back pay,\r\n\nand damages.   The Superior  Court granted the  Town's motion  to\r\n\ndismiss.  On appeal  to the New Hampshire Supreme  Court, certain\r\n\nstate law tort claims  were reversed and remanded.   King v. Town\r                                                                           \r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nof Hanover, 139  N.H. 752 (1995).  The  state litigation was then\r                    \r\n\nstayed  pending resolution  of  this federal  action, which  King\r\n\nfiled in  May 1994.  On  May 17, 1996 the  district court granted\r\n\nsummary judgment on  King's retaliation claim and his due process\r\n\nclaim.  See  King v. Town of  Hanover, 959 F.  Supp. 62 (D.  N.H.\r                                               \r\n\n1996).   On  June 20,  1996, the  district court  granted summary\r\n\njudgment  on  King's  wrongful  discharge  claim,  Order  of  the\r\n\nDistrict Court,  June 20,  1996 (unpublished), and,  on July  12,\r\n\n1996,  summary judgment  was granted  on his  breach of  contract\r\n\nclaim, Order of the  District Court, July 12, 1996 (unpublished).\r\n\nThe remaining  claims, for sexual harassment  and for intentional\r\n\ninfliction of  emotional distress, were  tried before  a jury  in\r\n\nAugust 1996.  The jury returned a verdict for the defendants.\r\n\n          Before us today is an appeal from  the district court's\r\n\nsummary  judgment rulings  as  to King's  retaliation claim,  due\r\n\nprocess claim,  wrongful discharge claim, and  breach of contract\r\n\nclaim.  We affirm.\r\n\n                          I.  Background\r                                    I.  Background\r\n\n          The dispute centers around a series of events, which we\r\n\nsummarize  briefly.   King  received  favorable evaluations  from\r\n\nHamill in both 1991 and 1992.   King claims that Hamill created a\r\n\nhostile  and  offensive sexual  atmosphere  in  the workplace  by\r\n\n\"repeatedly ma[king] sexually suggestive,  socially inappropriate\r\n\nand  offensive  comments  in an  effort  to  engage  Plaintiff in\r\n\nconversations and  interactions  of an  inappropriate and  sexual\r\n\nmanner.\"    Complaint    18.    Furthermore,  King  alleges  that\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nHamill's behavior  indicated that he thought  King was homosexual\r\n\nor interested in engaging in homosexual activity with Hamill.  As\r\n\na  result, King claims to have  suffered \"severe embarrassment, a\r\n\nhigh  level  of  stress,  and  personal  sense  of  humiliation.\"\r\n\nComplaint   24.\r\n\n          In  October  1992,  King  complained  to  Hauger  about\r\n\nHamill's  behavior and  requested  reassignment.   No action  was\r\n\ntaken.\r\n\n          The  Town claims  that  disciplinary  action was  taken\r\n\nagainst King in response to three work-related incidents.  First,\r\n\nin  December 1992,  King  drove  a  town  truck,  with  its  body\r\n\nelevated, into the  town garage,  causing $900 in  damage to  the\r\n\ntruck.  In February 1993, King's truck slid off the road during a\r\n\nsnowstorm.   Finally, in  March 1993, several  granite posts were\r\n\ndamaged  in an area where  King had been  instructed to push back\r\n\nsnow.  King  denied breaking the posts, but the  Town argued that\r\n\nhe was responsible for the damage.\r\n\n                      II.  Retaliation Claim\r                                II.  Retaliation Claim\r\n\n          King   claims  that   the   Town  disciplined   him  in\r\n\nretaliation  for his October 1992 complaint to Hauger.  Title VII\r\n\nprovides that:\r\n\n            [i]t  shall  be  an  unlawful  employment\r\n            practice for an employer  to discriminate\r\n            against  any  of  his  employees  .  .  .\r\n            because  [the  employee] has  opposed any\r\n            practice  made   an  unlawful  employment\r\n            practice by this  subchapter, or  because\r\n            he   has   made   a  charge,   testified,\r\n            assisted, or participated  in any  manner\r\n            in   an  investigation,   proceeding,  or\r\n            hearing under this subchapter.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n42 U.S.C.   2000e-3(a).\r\n\n          To  prevail,  King  must meet  the  familiar  McDonnell\r                                                                           \r\n\nDouglas test.  See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792\r                                                             \r\n\n(1973).   First,  the plaintiff  must come  forward with  a prima\r\n\nfacie showing of retaliation.  See id. at 802; Mesnick v. General\r                                                                           \r\n\nElectric Co., 950  F.2d 816, 827 (1st Cir. 1991).   The burden of\r                      \r\n\nproduction then shifts  to the defendant,  who must articulate  a\r\n\nlegitimate,  nondiscriminatory reason for  the adverse employment\r\n\naction.    The  production  of such  a  nondiscriminatory  reason\r\n\ndispels the presumption  of improper discrimination generated  by\r\n\nthe  prima facie showing of  discrimination.  Id.   The plaintiff\r                                                           \r\n\nthen  must show that the  proffered reason is  actually a pretext\r\n\nfor retaliation.  Id. at 823.\r                               \r\n\n          In  order to state  a prima  facie case,  the plaintiff\r                                                      \r\n\nmust show  (1) that he  engaged in an  activity  protected  under\r\n\nTitle  VII  or engaged  in protected  opposition to  an activity,\r\n\nwhich participation or opposition was known by the employer;  (2)\r\n\none  or more  employment actions  disadvantaging him;  and (3)  a\r\n\ncausal  connection   between  the  protected   activity  and  the\r\n\nemployment   action.     See   Hoeppner   v.  Crotched   Mountain\r                                                                           \r\n\nRehabilitation  Center, 31 F.3d 9, 14 (1st Cir. 1994); Petitti v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nNew England Tel &amp; Tel. Co., 909 F.2d 28, 33 (1st Cir. 1990).\r                                    \r\n\n          We agree with the district court's ruling that King has\r\n\nfailed  to  establish  a   sufficient  causal  link  between  his\r\n\nallegations of  sexual  harassment and  the disciplinary  actions\r\n\ntaken against him.\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n          As  we are  reviewing  the district  court's ruling  on\r\n\nsummary judgment, we view  the facts in the light  most favorable\r\n\nto the non-movant, King.  See Smith v. F.W. Morse &amp;  Co., 76 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n\n413, 428 (1st Cir.  1996).  We need not,  however, grant credence\r\n\nto   \"conclusory   allegations,   improbable    inferences,   and\r\n\nunsupported  speculation.\"  Medina-Mu oz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco\r                                                                           \r\n\nCo., 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1990).  In order to survive a motion\r             \r\n\nfor summary judgment, the plaintiff must point to evidence in the\r\n\nrecord that would  permit a rational factfinder  to conclude that\r\n\nthe employment action was retaliatory.  This evidence must  \"have\r\n\nsubstance  in the sense that  it limns differing  versions of the\r\n\ntruth which a factfinder must resolve at an ensuing trial.\"  Mack\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co., 871 F.2d 179, 181 (1st Cir. 1989).\r                                      \r\n\n          In his  appellate  brief, King  fails to  point to  any\r\n\nevidence that  the employment  activity was retaliatory.   King's\r\n\nargument  regarding  causation  amounts  to the  following.    In\r\n\nOctober  1992,  King  complained  to  Hauger  regarding  Hamill's\r\n\nbehavior toward him.  No record was kept of this complaint.  King\r\n\nclaims that the incidents  for which King was disciplined  were a\r\n\npretext for retaliation, and  the complaint was close in  time to\r\n\nthe disciplinary action.   Although King produced depositions and\r\n\naffidavits of  witnesses to challenge the  appropriateness of the\r\n\ndisciplinary   action,  this  evidence   contesting  the  factual\r\n\nunderpinnings of the reasons for the discipline, without more, is\r\n\ninsufficient to present a jury question regarding the retaliation\r\n\nclaim.  See Hoeppner v. Crotched Mountain Rehab. Center, Inc., 31\r                                                                       \r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nF.3d  9, 17  (1st Cir.  1994).   It is  insufficient for  King to\r\n\nsimply recount  that he  complained and  that he  was disciplined\r\n\nfive  months  later.    He  must  offer  sufficient  evidence  of\r\n\ndiscrimination for a  rational factfinder to  find in his  favor.\r\n\nIn this case, he offers no such evidence.\r\n\n                  III.  Procedural Due Process2\r                            III.  Procedural Due Process\r\n\n          King alleges that the disciplinary proceedings afforded\r\n\nhim were insufficient and \"denied his due process right to a fair\r\n\nhearing  on disciplinary  charges  in violation  of  42 U.S.C.   \r\n\n1983.\"  Appellant's Brief, at 17.  Specifically, King claims that\r\n\nhe had  a right to  hire a  certified court reporter  at his  own\r\n\nexpense to transcribe the sworn testimony at the hearing.\r\n\n          After  receiving the  Town's disciplinary  letter, King\r\n\nappealed,  as was his  right under  the Personnel  Policy Manual.\r\n\nThe Town  Manager scheduled a  hearing, though he  refused King's\r\n\nrequest  that the  hearing be  public and  that the  Town produce\r\n\ncertain town employees to testify.  King, represented by counsel,\r\n\narrived at the  hearing with a certified  court reporter, brought\r\n\nat  his own expense.  When the  Town Manager refused to allow the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  The Supreme Court recently decided  a similar case, Gilbert v.\r                                                                        \r\nHomar,    U.S.    , No. 96-65, 1997 WL 303380  (June 9, 1997), in\r               \r\nwhich an  employee  at a  state  university in  Pennsylvania  was\r\nsuspended  without pay.  That  case does not  govern our decision\r\ntoday,  however,  because in  Homar  the  Court assumed,  without\r                                             \r\ndeciding, that the  protections of the due  process clause extend\r\nto the suspension of a tenured public  employee.  Id. at *3.   In\r                                                               \r\nour  case, King  is an  at-will employee,  rather than  a tenured\r\nemployee,  and as such he  does not have  due process protections\r\nagainst a one week suspension followed by 90 days probation.\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nreporter to record  the hearing, King  refused to participate  in\r\n\nthe hearing.  The Town treated the appeal as withdrawn.\r\n\n          In  order to  succeed  on his  due process  claim under\r\n\nsection 1983,  King must  show that  he  has been  deprived of  a\r\n\nconstitutionally protected  liberty or property right.   See Paul\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 701 (1976); Correa-Mart nez v. Arrillaga-\r                                                                           \r\n\nBel ndez, 903 F.2d 49, 53  (1st Cir. 1990).  Although  King fails\r                  \r\n\nto  identify  the precise  interest  that  he  believes has  been\r\n\nviolated, our reading of  his brief and the record  suggests that\r\n\nhe claims a deprivation of a protected property interest.\r\n\n          In  Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, the Supreme\r                                                \r\n\nCourt stated that:\r\n\n            To have a property interest in a benefit,\r\n            a person clearly  must have more than  an\r\n            abstract need for it.   He must have more\r\n            than a unilateral expectation of it.   He\r\n            must, instead, have a legitimate claim of\r\n            entitlement  to  it .  .  .  .   Property\r\n            interests .  . .  are not created  by the\r\n            Constitution.    Rather they  are created\r\n            and  their  dimensions  are   defined  by\r\n            existing  rules  or  understandings  that\r\n            stem from  an independent source  such as\r\n            state-law  rules  or understandings  that\r\n            secure certain benefits and  that support\r\n            claims of entitlement to those benefits.\r\n\nId. at 577.\r             \r\n\n          It is  well established  that a public  employee has  a\r\n\nconstitutionally  protected property  interest  in his  continued\r\n\nemployment when  he reasonably  expects that his  employment will\r\n\ncontinue.

Id.\r                                   \r\n\n          New Hampshire  law is  clear.  \"[P]ublic  employment is\r\n\nnot a constitutionally protected property right of the employee.\"\r\n\nAppeal  of Parker, 121 N.H. 986, 988 (1981); Colburn v. Personnel\r                                                                           \r\n\nComm'n, 118 N.H. 60, 64 (1978); see also Soltani v. Smith, 812 F.\r                                                                   \r\n\nSupp. 1280,  1292 (D. N.H. 1993).   King did not  have a contract\r\n\nwith the Town.  He was an at-will employee who could be dismissed\r\n\nat any time.   He had, therefore, no protected  property interest\r\n\nin his employment.\r\n\n          King  suggests that  the  Hanover Department  of Public\r\n\nWorks  (\"DPW\") personnel policy manual  granted him the status of\r\n\nan employee that can be terminated only for cause, and only after\r\n\nthe  completion of certain procedural steps.  It is possible that\r\n\nthis manual restricted the  ability of the Town to  discipline or\r\n\nterminate  King.   See  Cummings,  985  F.2d  at  2.    Assuming,\r                                          \r\n\narguendo,  that King  is correct  in this  view, he  still cannot\r                  \r\n\nprevail  because the Town provided  all of the  process due under\r\n\nthe manual.  King was  entitled to, and received, a hearing.   He\r\n\ncomplains that he was denied his \"right to hire a certified court\r\n\nreporter  at his own expense,\" Appellant's Brief at 17, his right\r\n\nto  a public  hearing, and  his  right to  have the  Town produce\r\n\ncertain  town employees  as  witnesses.   Nothing  in the  policy\r\n\nmanual,  however,   provides   that  an   employee   subject   to\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\ndisciplinary  action  short of  dismissal  is  entitled to  these\r\n\nprocedures.\r\n\n                     IV.  Wrongful Discharge\r                               IV.  Wrongful Discharge\r\n\n          King   also  alleges  that   he  has   been  wrongfully\r\n\ndischarged,  a common law violation under New Hampshire law.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nWenners v.  Great State  Beverages, 140  N.H.  100 (1995),  cert.\r                                                                           \r\n\ndenied, 116 S. Ct. 926 (1996).\r                \r\n\n          Whatever  else may be required to prevail on a wrongful\r\n\ndischarge  claim,  the  plaintiff   must  have  been  ctually  or\r\n\nconstructively discharged.  King  was not.  He was  suspended for\r\n\none week without pay and placed on  ninety days probation.  King,\r                                                                          \r\n\n959 F. Supp. at  64.  The  district court noted that  \"[a]lthough\r\n\nthe plaintiff argues that his suspension could eventually had led\r\n\nto  a  dismissal, the  fact remains  that  the plaintiff  was not\r\n\ndismissed.\"  Id. at 68.\r                          \r\n\n          It is conceivable that King could have saved this claim\r\n\nby arguing that  he was  constructively dismissed.   We need  not\r\n\nprobe this point, however, for he has not advanced this argument.\r\n\nWe  therefore  affirm  the  district  court's  grant  of  summary\r\n\njudgment on the wrongful discharge claim.\r\n\n                        V.  Contract Claim\r                                  V.  Contract Claim\r\n\n          Finally, King attempts to avoid summary judgment on his\r\n\ncontract  claim.   King's  appellate  brief  offers virtually  no\r\n\nargument  with respect  to this  claim.   Beyond a  few  lines of\r\n\nintroduction, his argument, in its entirety, is as follows:\r\n\n               Mr.    King's   constitutional    [due\r\n            process] and contractual  claims that  he\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\n            was  denied  a fair  disciplinary hearing\r\n            are similar, but are not identical.\r\n\n               Even if the Town  may deny him a court\r\n            reporter and a public hearing as a matter\r\n            of  constitutional  law, these  are clear\r\n            rights  under  New   Hampshire  law   and\r\n            therefore should have been provided under\r\n            his contractual right to a  fair hearing.\r\n            The common law of  contracts holds that a\r\n            contract    should   be    construed   to\r\n            incorporate the law.   17A  Am. Jur.  2d,\r\n            Contracts    346  and     381  (\"[I]t  is\r\n            commonly said  that  all existing  . .  .\r\n            applicable  . . . statements . . . at the\r\n            time a contract is made become part of it\r\n            and must be read into it.\").\r\n\nAppellant's Brief, at 41.\r\n\n          It  is  an  established  appellate  rule  that  \"issues\r\n\nadverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort\r\n\nat developed argumentation, are deemed waived .  . . .

King was\r\n\nsupervised  by  Leo  Hamill  (\"Hamill\") from  July  1991  onward.\r\n\nHamill's immediate supervisor was  Richard Hauger (\"Hauger\").  In\r\n\nMarch  1993, Hauger  informed King  that he  had decided  to take\r\n\ndisciplinary action for  incidents in which  King was alleged  to\r\n\nhave  destroyed town property.   King was suspended  for one week\r\n\nwithout  pay  and placed  on probation  for  ninety days.   After\r\n\nreceiving notice  of the suspension and  probation, plaintiff did\r\n\nnot return to work.\r\n\n          In May 1993, King exercised his right, under  the DPW's\r\n\npersonnel policy manual, to appeal the disciplinary action to the\r\n\nTown  Manager.    A  hearing was  scheduled  for  May  26.   King\r\n\nrequested that the hearing  be open to the public,  that the Town\r\n\nproduce certain witnesses  to testify, that  the Town record  the\r\n\nhearing or  permit a court  reporter to do so  at King's expense,\r\n\nand  that the  town manager,  defendant Clifford  Vermiya, excuse\r\n\nhimself  from the  proceedings based on  a conflict  of interest.\r\n\nWhen  all  of  these requests  were  denied,  King  chose not  to\r\n\nparticipate.\r\n\n          On July 21,  1993, King filed a  bill of equity in  the\r\n\nGrafton County  Superior Court  seeking reinstatement,  back pay,\r\n\nand damages.   The Superior  Court granted the  Town's motion  to\r\n\ndismiss.  On appeal  to the New Hampshire Supreme  Court, certain\r\n\nstate law tort claims  were reversed and remanded.   King v.

The  state litigation was then\r                    \r\n\nstayed  pending resolution  of  this federal  action, which  King\r\n\nfiled in  May 1994.  On  May 17, 1996 the  district court granted\r\n\nsummary judgment on  King's retaliation claim and his due process\r\n\nclaim.  See  King v. Town of  Hanover, 959 F.  Supp. 62 (D.  N.H.\r                                               \r\n\n1996).   On  June 20,  1996, the  district court  granted summary\r\n\njudgment  on  King's  wrongful  discharge  claim,  Order  of  the\r\n\nDistrict Court,  June 20,  1996 (unpublished), and,  on July  12,\r\n\n1996,  summary judgment  was granted  on his  breach of  contract\r\n\nclaim, Order of the  District Court, July 12, 1996 (unpublished).\r\n\nThe remaining  claims, for sexual harassment  and for intentional\r\n\ninfliction of  emotional distress, were  tried before  a jury  in\r\n\nAugust 1996.  The jury returned a verdict for the defendants.\r\n\n          Before us today is an appeal from  the district court's\r\n\nsummary  judgment rulings  as  to King's  retaliation claim,  due\r\n\nprocess claim,  wrongful discharge claim, and  breach of contract\r\n\nclaim.  We affirm.\r\n\n                          I.  Background\r                                    I.  Background\r\n\n          The dispute centers around a series of events, which we\r\n\nsummarize  briefly.   King  received  favorable evaluations  from\r\n\nHamill in both 1991 and 1992.   King claims that Hamill created a\r\n\nhostile  and  offensive sexual  atmosphere  in  the workplace  by\r\n\n\"repeatedly ma[king] sexually suggestive,  socially inappropriate\r\n\nand  offensive  comments  in an  effort  to  engage  Plaintiff in\r\n\nconversations and  interactions  of an  inappropriate and  sexual\r\n\nmanner.\"    Complaint    18.    Furthermore,  King  alleges  that\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nHamill's behavior  indicated that he thought  King was homosexual\r\n\nor interested in engaging in homosexual activity with Hamill.  As\r\n\na  result, King claims to have  suffered \"severe embarrassment, a\r\n\nhigh  level  of  stress,  and  personal  sense  of  humiliation.\"\r\n\nComplaint   24.\r\n\n          In  October  1992,  King  complained  to  Hauger  about\r\n\nHamill's  behavior and  requested  reassignment.   No action  was\r\n\ntaken.\r\n\n          The  Town claims  that  disciplinary  action was  taken\r\n\nagainst King in response to three work-related incidents.  First,\r\n\nin  December 1992,  King  drove  a  town  truck,  with  its  body\r\n\nelevated, into the  town garage,  causing $900 in  damage to  the\r\n\ntruck.  In February 1993, King's truck slid off the road during a\r\n\nsnowstorm.   Finally, in  March 1993, several  granite posts were\r\n\ndamaged  in an area where  King had been  instructed to push back\r\n\nsnow.

King's\r\n\nargument  regarding  causation  amounts  to the  following.    In\r\n\nOctober  1992,  King  complained  to  Hauger  regarding  Hamill's\r\n\nbehavior toward him.  No record was kept of this complaint.  King\r\n\nclaims that the incidents  for which King was disciplined  were a\r\n\npretext for retaliation, and  the complaint was close in  time to\r\n\nthe disciplinary action.   Although King produced depositions and\r\n\naffidavits of  witnesses to challenge the  appropriateness of the\r\n\ndisciplinary   action,  this  evidence   contesting  the  factual\r\n\nunderpinnings of the reasons for the discipline, without more, is\r\n\ninsufficient to present a jury question regarding the retaliation\r\n\nclaim.  See Hoeppner v. Crotched Mountain Rehab.

It is  insufficient for  King to\r\n\nsimply recount  that he  complained and  that he  was disciplined\r\n\nfive  months  later.    He  must  offer  sufficient  evidence  of\r\n\ndiscrimination for a  rational factfinder to  find in his  favor.\r\n\nIn this case, he offers no such evidence.\r\n\n                  III.  Procedural Due Process2\r                            III.

Specifically, King claims that\r\n\nhe had  a right to  hire a  certified court reporter  at his  own\r\n\nexpense to transcribe the sworn testimony at the hearing.\r\n\n          After  receiving the  Town's disciplinary  letter, King\r\n\nappealed,  as was his  right under  the Personnel  Policy Manual.\r\n\nThe Town  Manager scheduled a  hearing, though he  refused King's\r\n\nrequest  that the  hearing be  public and  that the  Town produce\r\n\ncertain town employees to testify.

He was an at-will employee who could be dismissed\r\n\nat any time.   He had, therefore, no protected  property interest\r\n\nin his employment.\r\n\n          King  suggests that  the  Hanover Department  of Public\r\n\nWorks  (\"DPW\") personnel policy manual  granted him the status of\r\n\nan employee that can be terminated only for cause, and only after\r\n\nthe  completion of certain procedural steps.  It is possible that\r\n\nthis manual restricted the  ability of the Town to  discipline or\r\n\nterminate  King.   See  Cummings,  985  F.2d  at  2.    Assuming,\r                                          \r\n\narguendo,  that King  is correct  in this  view, he  still cannot\r                  \r\n\nprevail  because the Town provided  all of the  process due under\r\n\nthe manual.  King was  entitled to, and received, a hearing.   He\r\n\ncomplains that he was denied his \"right to hire a certified court\r\n\nreporter  at his own expense,\" Appellant's Brief at 17, his right\r\n\nto  a public  hearing, and  his  right to  have the  Town produce\r\n\ncertain  town employees  as  witnesses.   Nothing  in the  policy\r\n\nmanual,  however,   provides   that  an   employee   subject   to\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\ndisciplinary  action  short of  dismissal  is  entitled to  these\r\n\nprocedures.\r\n\n                     IV.

King's  appellate  brief  offers virtually  no\r\n\nargument  with respect  to this  claim.   Beyond a  few  lines of\r\n\nintroduction, his argument, in its entirety, is as follows:\r\n\n               Mr.    King's   constitutional    [due\r\n            process] and contractual  claims that  he\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\n            was  denied  a fair  disciplinary hearing\r\n            are similar, but are not identical.\r\n\n               Even if the Town  may deny him a court\r\n            reporter and a public hearing as a matter\r\n            of  constitutional  law, these  are clear\r\n            rights  under  New   Hampshire  law   and\r\n            therefore should have been provided under\r\n            his contractual right to a  fair hearing.\r\n            The common law of  contracts holds that a\r\n            contract    should   be    construed   to\r\n            incorporate the law.   17A  Am. Jur.  2d,\r\n            Contracts    346  and     381  (\"[I]t  is\r\n            commonly said  that  all existing  . .  .\r\n            applicable  . . . statements . . . at the\r\n            time a contract is made become part of it\r\n            and must be read into it.\").\r\n\nAppellant's Brief, at 41.\r\n\n          It  is  an  established  appellate  rule  that  \"issues\r\n\nadverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort\r\n\nat developed argumentation, are deemed waived .  . . .  It is not\r\n\nenough merely to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal\r\n\nway, leaving the  court to do counsel's work . .  . .  Judges are\r\n\nnot  expected to be mindreaders.  Consequently, a litigant has an\r\n\nobligation to spell  out its  arguments squarely  and distinctly,\r\n\nor else forever hold its  peace.\"  Willhauck v.
