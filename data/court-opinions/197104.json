In  1991, defendant  Douglas  Burke  was\r                            \r\n\nconvicted in  federal  court on  counterfeiting  charges  and\r\n\nlater sentenced to  28 months  in prison and  three years  of\r\n\nsupervised release.  In 1995, while on supervised release, he\r\n\nwas arrested on state fraud charges.  Upon his plea of guilty\r\n\nto such charges, the  state court sentenced him to a  term in\r\n\nstate  prison.   In turn,  after finding  that  defendant had\r\n\nthereby violated the  conditions of  his supervised  release,\r\n\nthe federal  court revoked  his release status  and sentenced\r\n\nhim to a consecutive,  24-month term in federal prison.   The\r\n\nvalidity of this latter sentence is the sole issue on appeal.\r\n\n     Defendant's counsel,  voicing the belief that the appeal\r\n\npresents  no  nonfrivolous  issues,  has filed  a  motion  to\r\n\nwithdraw  accompanied by  an  Anders  brief; the  government,\r                                                \r\n\nespousing the  same view, has moved  for summary disposition.\r\n\nDefendant has filed a pro se  brief and an opposition to  the\r\n\ngovernment's motion.  \r\n\n     We agree that the  appeal is frivolous.  That  defendant\r\n\nviolated  the conditions  of  his supervised  release is  not\r\n\ndisputed, and  the sentence imposed was  within the governing\r\n\nstatutory and guideline ranges.   See 18 U.S.C.   3583(e)(3);\r                                                 \r\n\nU.S.S.G.     7B1.4(a).    The  sole  contention  advanced  in\r\n\ndefendant's pro  se brief--that  the federal court  relied on\r\n\nfalse information--is misplaced.  The record reveals that the\r\n\nstate court did,  in fact,  base its sentence  partly on  the\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nexpectation that further  imprisonment would result from  the\r\n\nfederal   proceedings.    That   such  expectation   was  not\r\n\nmemorialized  in the  plea  agreement is  of  no moment;  the\r\n\nmatter was brought  to the state  court's attention prior  to\r\n\nthe  imposition of sentence.   And the federal  court was not\r\n\nadvised (contrary  to defendant's  suggestion) that  the plea\r\n\nagreement itself referred to the matter. \r\n\n     In  turn, while we  express no  opinion on  the parties'\r\n\nshared assertion  that U.S.S.G.   7B1.3(f), with its call for\r\n\nconsecutive sentencing,  is binding on the  lower court, see,\r                                                                        \r\n\ne.g.,  United States  v. Throneburg,  87  F.3d 851,  854 (6th\r                                               \r\n\nCir.), cert.  denied, 65 U.S.L.W. 3341  (1996); United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.  Caves, 73  F.3d 823,  824 (8th  Cir. 1996)  (per curiam);\r                     \r\n\nUnited States v. Hill,  48 F.3d 228, 230-32 (7th  Cir. 1995);\r                                 \r\n\nsee also United States v. O'Neil, 11 F.3d 292, 301  n.11 (1st\r                                            \r\n\nCir. 1993);  compare, e.g.,  United States v.  Alexander,    \r                                                                    \r\n\nF.3d     , 1996 WL 656094 (5th Cir. 1996) (discussing   5G1.3\r\n\nn.6); United States  v. Gondek, 65 F.3d 1,  2 (1st Cir. 1995)\r                                          \r\n\n(same), the matter is without significance  here.  The record\r\n\ndoes not suggest that  the district court believed it  had no\r\n\nalternative but to impose a consecutive sentence.  See, e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nThroneburg, 87 F.3d at 854.  Compare United States v. Sparks,\r                                                                        \r\n\n19  F.3d  1099, 1100-01  (6th Cir.  1994).   Imposition  of a\r\n\nconsecutive  sentence  was   obviously  warranted  under  the\r\n\ncircumstances--particularly given the rationale for the state\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\ncourt  sentence.   And  defendant acknowledged  below that  a\r\n\nconsecutive sentence was appropriate.  \r\n\n     Defense  counsel's   motion  to  withdraw   is  granted,\r                                                                         \r\n\nappellee's motion for summary disposition is granted, and the\r                                                                         \r\n\njudgment is affirmed.\r                                 \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
