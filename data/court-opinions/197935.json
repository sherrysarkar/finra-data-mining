MURPHY,\r\n                    Plaintiff, Appellant,\r\n\n                             v.\r\n\n                   PAUL BARNICLE, ET AL.,\r\n                   Defendants, Appellees.\r\n\n                                        \r\n\n        APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n              FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n        [Hon. Robert E. Keeton, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                                        \r\n\n                           Before\r\n\n                   Boudin, Stahl and Lynch,\r\n                       Circuit Judges.\r\n\n                                        \r\n\nRobert P. Murphy on brief pro se.\r\nMerita A. Hopkins, Corporation Counsel, and Dawna McIntyre,\r\nAssistant Corporation Counsel, City of Boston Law Department, on brief\r\nfor appellee Paul Barnicle.\r\nScott Harshbarger, Attorney General, and Susanne G. Levsen,\r\nAssistant Attorney General, on brief for appellee James Larkin.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                          May 6, 1998\r\n                                         \r\n\n       Per Curiam.  Appellant Robert F. Murphy appeals from\r\nthe dismissal of his complaint.  A careful review of the record\r\nand the parties' briefs, however, reveals that the dismissal\r\nwas warranted.  We therefore affirm the judgment of the\r\ndistrict court for essentially the reasons stated in its\r\nMemorandum and Order, dated February 24, 1997.  We add only the\r\nfollowing comments.\r\n         1.  In claiming that the alleged perjury during the\r\nprobate case violated his constitutional rights, appellant\r\nessentially is seeking federal review of the state court\r\nproceedings.  That is, even if appellant is not attacking any\r\nspecific orders of the probate court, his claim nonetheless is\r\n\"inextricably intertwined\" with that court's proceedings.  This\r\ncivil action may not be used as a vehicle to obtain federal\r\nreview in the lower federal courts of the state probate court\r\ndecision.  Appellant's recourse lies within the state appellate\r\nsystem.  See Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413 (1923);\r\nDistrict of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462\r\n(1983).  See also Phinizy v. State of Alabama, 847 F.2d 282,\r\n284 (5th Cir. 1988) (the claim that a probate court's conduct\r\nof a proceeding denied plaintiff due process is barred by the\r\nRooker-Feldman doctrine; plaintiff's remedy was to appeal\r\nthrough the state court system).\r\n         2.  A review of the record also reveals that the\r\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in denying\r\nappellant's motion for the appointment of counsel.  SeeDesRosiers v. Moran, 949 F.2d 15, 23-24 (1st Cir. 1991)\r\n(requiring exceptional circumstances).\r\n         3.  We do not reach appellant's challenge to the\r\ndistrict court's order to pay costs because the district court\r\nnever assessed a specific dollar amount against appellant. \r\nTherefore, there is nothing for this court to review.\r\n         The judgment of the district court is affirmed in all\r\nrespects.  However, we modify the judgment of dismissal to be\r\nwithout prejudice as to the  1983 claims relating to the\r\ncriminal trial only.  See Guzman-Rivera v. Rivera-Cruz, 29 F.3d\r\n3, 6 (1st Cir. 1994).  The dismissal of the state claims\r\nremains without prejudice and the dismissal of the remainder of\r\nthe federal claims remains with prejudice.\n",
