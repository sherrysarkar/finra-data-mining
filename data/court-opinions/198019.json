Levsen,\r\nAssistant Attorney General, on brief for appellees.\r\n\nJune 19, 1998\r\n\n        Per Curiam.  Upon careful review of the briefs and\r\nrecord, we reach essentially the same conclusion reached by the\r\ndistrict court.  In our de novo review, we have applied the\r\nstandard set forth in Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 637\r\n(1993), and we have considered the factors outlined in\r\nLevasseur v. Pepe, 70 F.3d 187, 193 (1st Cir. 1995).  Thus, we\r\nconclude that, although the videotape may have been used\r\nextensively at the trial, and the identification issue to which\r\nit pertained may have been the central question before the\r\njury, still the properly admitted evidence against petitioner\r\nwas so strong that, even assuming the videotape improperly was\r\nshown to the jury, habeas relief is not warranted.  \r\n          Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
