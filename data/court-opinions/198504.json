Vega-Pacheco,\r\nAssistant United States Attorney, and Michelle Morales, Assistant\r\nUnited States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nJune 8, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  Appellant Angel Cecilio Hurtado-Araujo\r\nappeals from the denial of his request for a prompt probation-\r\nrevocation hearing.  In that motion, appellant relied solely on\r\nthe Interstate Agreement on  Detainers Act.  See 18 U.S.C. App. \r\nYet that enactment does not apply to detainers based on\r\nprobation-violation charges.  See Carchman v. Nash, 473 U.S.\r\n716 (1985).  We add that appellant's principal concern--that he\r\nwill lose the opportunity to be sentenced to a concurrent\r\nprison term--is largely misplaced in any event.  Although\r\nU.S.S.G.  7B1.3(f) calls for a consecutive sentence in this\r\ncontext, that provision is \"advisory rather than mandatory.\" \r\nUnited States v. O'Neil, 11 F.3d 292, 301 n.11 (1st Cir. 1993);\r\naccord, e.g., United States v. Throneburg, 87 F.3d 851, 854 (6th\r\nCir. 1996).  The possibility of appellant receiving a\r\nconcurrent sentence once the revocation hearing is held thus\r\ncannot be excluded.  We of course intimate no view as to the\r\nappropriateness of any such sentence.\r\n          Affirmed.  See Loc. R. 27.1.   \n",
