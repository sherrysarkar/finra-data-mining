This appeal by the Rhode\n\nIsland Attorney General and the Director of the Rhode Island\n\nDepartment    of    Environmental    Management       challenges    various\n\nrulings which prompted the district court to hold that appellee\n\nDavid LaRoche's obligations to the State of Rhode Island, for\n\nits costs in remediating water contamination on property owned\n\nby LaRoche and for related civil penalties, were expunged by the\n\nchapter 7 discharge subsequently obtained by LaRoche.              We vacate\n\nand remand, with directions that judgment enter for appellants.\n\n                                     I\n\n                               BACKGROUND\n\n            In 1988, appellants joined in citizen lawsuits brought\n\nagainst LaRoche in the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Rhode Island, claiming violations of the Clean Water\n\nAct (\"CWA\"), 33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq., and the Rhode Island\n\nWater Pollution Control Act (\"RIWPCA\"), R.I. Gen. Laws § 46-12-1\n\net seq. (the \"CWA/RIWPCA action\").           Ultimately, the district\n\ncourt entered partial summary judgment for appellants, after\n\ndetermining that LaRoche had known, prior to purchasing the\n\nproperty,    that   its   faulty    septic   system    was   polluting   an\n\nadjacent river.     See Friends of Sakonnet v. Dutra, 738 F. Supp.\n\n623 (D.R.I. 1990).        The amount of the remedial damages award\n\nagainst LaRoche remained unresolved.\n\n\n                                     3\n\f              Creditors          instituted             involuntary           chapter         11\n\nreorganization proceedings against LaRoche in January 1991; the\n\norder   for    relief      was    entered         in    February       1991,    see    In    re\n\nLaRoche, 969 F.2d 1299, 1300 (1st Cir. 1992), and the chapter 11\n\ntrustee was appointed on June 4, 1991.\n\n              Meanwhile, the parties had negotiated a settlement of\n\nall the remedial issues in the CWA/RIWPCA action pending before\n\nthe   federal      district       court.          Whereupon      the     district          court\n\nentered   a    consent      decree,      which         stated,     inter       alia:        \"The\n\nintention of the parties is to resolve any pending disputes\n\narising out of this matter.                       The only responsibilities and\n\nobligations        that    will   survive         are    those     set       forth   in     this\n\nStipulation.\"\n\n              In   due    course,    a     special        master       was    appointed       to\n\nmarshal a settlement fund from the State and the former owners\n\nof the LaRoche property for the purpose of acquiring an adjacent\n\ntract   of    land       upon    which   to       construct       a    new     waste       water\n\ncollection and treatment facility.                     Any excess acreage, over and\n\nabove that required for the new facility, was to be sold to\n\ncover related project costs.\n\n              LaRoche      agreed     to      reimburse          the     State       for     any\n\n\"shortfall amount,\" defined as the difference between ninety\n\npercent of the cost of the new waste water collection and\n\n\n                                              4\n\ftreatment facility and the net proceeds from the sale of any\n\nexcess acreage.          In addition, LaRoche promised to \"affirm his\n\nobligation to pay the [shortfall amount], to the extent then\n\nunpaid, as a debt not discharged in any bankruptcy proceeding in\n\nwhich    he   is   the   bankrupt   whether    now   pending    or   hereafter\n\nfiled.\"1      Finally, LaRoche pledged to \"procure an order of the\n\nUnited States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Rhode Island\n\nin   [his     involuntary     bankruptcy      proceeding]      affirming   his\n\nobligation to pay the [shortfall amount] and to perform his\n\nother obligations hereunder.\"\n\n              All parties agreed to proceed \"expeditiously\" and \"in\n\ngood faith\" with their respective obligations under the consent\n\ndecree, which further provided as follows:\n\n              LaRoche hereby agrees to the imposition of a\n              civil penalty under the Rhode Island Water\n              Pollution Control Act and regulations issued\n              thereunder equal to the [shortfall amount].\n              DEM and the Attorney General agree that the\n\n\n     1\n     By negative inference, from Federal Rule of Bankruptcy\nProcedure 4008 (\"A motion by the debtor for approval of a\nreaffirmation agreement shall be filed before or at the\nhearing.\"), only the chapter 7 debtor may request bankruptcy\ncourt approval of a reaffirmation agreement. See BankBoston v.\nClaflin (In re Claflin), 249 B.R. 840, 843 (B.A.P. 1st Cir.\n2000); In re Carlos, 215 B.R. 52, 61 (Bankr. C.D. Cal. 1997); In\nre Newsome, 3 B.R. 626, 629 (Bankr. D. W. Va. 1980) (\"[T]o\npermit creditors to make applications for reaffirmations would\ncontravene the intent of Congress and permit in many instances\nthe very acts the Congress sought to condemn.\"); 4 Lawrence P.\nKing, Collier on Bankruptcy ¶ 524.04, at 524-30 (citing Fed. R.\nBankr. P. 4008).\n\n                                      5\n\f            imposition of such civil penalty will be\n            stayed for so long as LaRoche complies with\n            his obligations under Section II.3.C of this\n            Stipulation [viz., to seek reaffirmation of\n            his obligation to pay this debt in his\n            involuntary bankruptcy case] and/or for so\n            long as any order procured         from the\n            Bankruptcy Court under Section II.3.D [ viz.,\n            an order approving LaRoche's reaffirmation\n            of his prepetition debt] remains in effect.\n            LaRoche specifically agrees that the civil\n            penalty imposed hereunder constitutes a debt\n            for a fine, penalty or forfeiture payable to\n            and for the benefit of a governmental unit,\n            is not compensation for actual pecuniary\n            loss and is specifically non-dischargeable\n            under 11 U.S.C. [§] 523(a)(7).\n\n(Emphasis    added.)    The   district    court   explicitly   retained\n\n\"continuing    jurisdiction    over      this   Stipulation    and   the\n\nperformance of the parties hereto.\"\n\n            Although LaRoche was granted a chapter 7 discharge, see\n\n11 U.S.C. § 727,2 on March 3, 1995, it was more than two years\n\nlater, on April 10, 1997, before he finally submitted a motion\n\nto reaffirm the \"shortfall amount\" indebtedness.\n\n            Following a hearing which appellants elected not to\n\nattend, the bankruptcy court rejected the motion to reaffirm\n\nsubmitted by LaRoche.3    At the same time, the bankruptcy court\n\n\n    2The chapter 11 proceeding was converted to chapter 7 on\nAugust 1, 1994.\n    3Although the basis for the denial by the bankruptcy court\nis not disclosed in the record on appeal, the parties are in\nagreement that the ruling was grounded in the United States\nTrustee's objection that the motion to reaffirm was untimely.\n\n                                  6\n\fexpressed concern that its rejection of the motion to reaffirm\n\nmight obstruct the State's efforts to recover the \"shortfall\n\namount.\"    Accordingly, the bankruptcy court directed that its\n\norder — rejecting LaRoche's motion to reaffirm the \"shortfall\n\namount\"    indebtedness    —    be    served   upon   all   parties   to   the\n\nCWA/RIWPCA consent decree and \"[t]hat all entities who oppose\n\nthe entry of this Order shall have ten (10) days from the entry\n\nof this Order within which to file a motion under Fed. R. Bankr.\n\nP. 9023 to alter and amend this Order.\"\n\n           Appellants elected not to submit a Rule 9023 motion,\n\nopting instead for a motion before the district court (which had\n\nretained    jurisdiction       over   the   CWA/RIWPCA      consent   decree)\n\nseeking a judicial declaration that LaRoche had breached the\n\nreaffirmation agreement, thereby rendering himself liable for\n\nthe alternative civil penalty in a sum equal to the \"shortfall\n\namount,\" estimated at more than one million dollars.                  LaRoche\n\nresponded that (i) the consent decree was void and unenforceable\n\ndue to appellants' failure to comply with the prerequisites to\n\nreaffirmation, see Bankruptcy Code § 524(c), 11 U.S.C. § 524(c),\n\nand (ii) consequently, the general discharge he was granted\n\n\n\nSee Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4008 (stating that hearing on application\nto reaffirm prepetition debt is to be held within 30 days of\norder granting or denying general discharge).      For present\npurposes, we accept their characterization.\n\n                                       7\n\frelieved him of all liabilities, including those asserted by\n\nappellants.\n\n            For their part, appellants argued that the consent\n\ndecree itself expressly defined the civil penalty imposed upon\n\nLaRoche    as   a    fine   payable     to   and    for   the   benefit    of    a\n\ngovernmental        unit,   rather    than   as    compensation     for   actual\n\npecuniary loss.        Accordingly, appellants contended, the civil\n\npenalty imposed against LaRoche was rendered nondischargeable as\n\na matter of law.        See id. § 523(a)(7).\n\n            In due course, the district court determined that the\n\ncharacterization        which   the    consent     decree   ascribed      to   the\n\nLaRoche indebtedness for the civil penalty in the shortfall\n\namount — viz., a nondischargeable \"civil penalty\" — was not\n\nconclusive.     Consequently, the district court opined, in order\n\nto safeguard their rights it was incumbent upon appellants not\n\nonly to have submitted a proof of claim, but also to have\n\ncommenced an adversary proceeding to obtain a bankruptcy court\n\nruling that the LaRoche indebtedness for the shortfall amount\n\nwas   a   nondischargeable      civil       penalty.      Failing    that,     the\n\ndistrict court reasoned, the general discharge in bankruptcy\n\ngranted LaRoche in the bankruptcy court presumptively discharged\n\nthe civil penalty in the \"shortfall amount\" as contemplated by\n\nthe CWA/RIWPCA consent decree.\n\n\n                                        8\n\f                                       II\n\n                                 DISCUSSION\n\n           Appellants contend that the explicit language employed\n\nin the CWA/RIWPCA consent decree — triggering a contingent\n\n\"civil penalty\" if and whenever LaRoche were to default on his\n\nobligation     to    procure     bankruptcy        court    approval      of    the\n\nreaffirmation       agreement   relating      to    the    \"shortfall     amount\"\n\nindebtedness    to     appellants      —    rendered       the    civil   penalty\n\nnondischargeable under Bankruptcy Code § 523(a)(7), 11 U.S.C. §\n\n523(a)(7).     Accordingly, appellants insist, the interpretation\n\nthe district court ascribed to the CWA/RIWPCA consent decree\n\ncontravened the \"law of the case\" doctrine, which \"makes binding\n\nupon a court a ruling made [in] the same . . . level [of court]\n\nduring prior stages of the same litigation.\"                     Lacy v. Gardino,\n\n791 F.2d 980, 984 (1st Cir. 1986).\n\n           The district court ruling — viz., that appellants\n\nfailed either to establish or preserve their entitlement to a\n\njudicial   determination        that   their    claim      was     excepted    from\n\ndischarge — presents us with a mixed question of law and fact\n\nsubject to de novo review.                 See, e.g., Warfel v. City            of\n\nSaratoga, 268 B.R. 205, 209 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 2001) (noting that\n\ndischargeability exceptions under § 523(a)(7) normally turn upon\n\nwhether undisputed facts fit pertinent legal rule).                    Similarly,\n\n\n                                       9\n\fa judicial interpretation of the terms of a consent decree is\n\nsubject to plenary review.          See Braxton v. United States, 500\n\nU.S. 344, 350 (1991).\n\n           Bankruptcy Code § 523(a)(7) excepts from discharge in\n\nbankruptcy any debt \"for a fine, penalty, or forfeiture payable\n\nto and for the benefit of a governmental unit, [which] is not\n\ncompensation for actual pecuniary loss.\"            11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(7).\n\nThus, in order to establish that the instant consent decree\n\nimposed a nondischargeable obligation upon LaRoche, appellants\n\nneeded to establish that their claim was based on (i) a \"fine,\n\npenalty, or forfeiture,\" (ii) \"payable to and for the benefit of\n\na governmental unit,\" and (iii) \"not compensation for actual\n\npecuniary loss.\"       Id.     Were appellants required to relitigate\n\nthe dischargeability issue de novo, there may well have been\n\nsubstantial impediments to overcome.             We explain.\n\n           Although Bankruptcy Code § 523(a)(7) applies both to\n\ncivil and criminal penalties, see U.S. Dep't of Hous. & Urban\n\nDev. v. Cost Control Mktg. & Sales Mgmt. of Va., Inc., 64 F.3d\n\n920,   927-28   (4th    Cir.     1995),   in     order   to   qualify    for    a\n\ndischargeability exception under subsection 523(a)(7), normally\n\nthe    particular      penalty     must    serve     some     \"punitive\"       or\n\n\"rehabilitative\"       governmental       aim,    rather      than   a   purely\n\n\n\n\n                                     10\n\fcompensatory purpose.        See Kelly v. Robinson, 479 U.S. 36, 52\n\n(1986).\n\n            Appellants contend that these civil penalties, imposed\n\npursuant to Rhode Island law, see R.I. Gen. Laws § 46-12-13,\n\nwere      designed   to      deter   and     remediate     environmental\n\ncontamination, a particularly important governmental function\n\nimplemented under the State's police and regulatory powers.\n\nMoreover, appellants argue, LaRoche potentially was exposed to\n\nfines up to $25,000 per day, a sum which bears neither any\n\nobvious    nor   essential    correlation   to   the   amount   needed   to\n\ncompensate the State for its actual response costs.\n\n            On the other hand, there can be no question but that\n\nthe consent decree itself explicitly equates the amount of these\n\ncivil penalties with the \"shortfall amount,\" which in turn\n\nplainly was designed to reimburse the State for its actual\n\nlosses, neither more nor less.            Appellants respond, however,\n\nthat their decision to calculate the punitive fines under that\n\nconvenient methodology cannot deprive these civil penalties of\n\ntheir \"punitive\" nature.       See, e.g., State Bar of Mich. v. Doerr\n\n(In re Doerr), 185 B.R. 533, 536-37 (Bankr. W.D. Mich. 1995).\n\nWe need not resolve these issues, however, since the CWA/RIWPCA\n\nconsent     decree   itself    disposes     of   the   contention    that\n\n\n\n\n                                     11\n\fappellants' claim is excepted from discharge under Bankruptcy\n\nCode § 523(a)(7).\n\n               First, the district court erred, as a matter of law,\n\nin    ruling     that       appellants    forfeited       their      rights    by    not\n\ncommencing       a    timely    adversary       proceeding     to     determine      the\n\ndischargeability of these debts while the LaRoche bankruptcy\n\nproceeding was pending.            Normally, the Bankruptcy Code enables\n\na debtor to obtain a discharge \"from all debts that arose before\n\nthe date of the order for relief.\"                   Bankruptcy Code § 727(b);\n\nsee     also    id.     §     524(a).          Any   claim     for    environmental\n\ncontamination asserted against LaRoche plainly arose prior to\n\nthe chapter 11 petition.           See id. § 101(5) (defining \"claim\" as\n\na \"right to payment, whether or not such right is reduced to\n\njudgment, . . . fixed, [or] contingent\").                    Consequently, absent\n\nexceptional          circumstances       not    present   here,       any    liability\n\nincurred       for     environmental       contamination        would       have    been\n\nextinguished by the discharge in bankruptcy LaRoche obtained in\n\n1995.\n\n               On the other hand, under the terms of the consent\n\ndecree, LaRoche became liable to appellants for two distinct\n\ndebts:    the \"shortfall amount\" and the contingent civil penalty.\n\nThus,    as    appellants       correctly       point   out,    the    present      case\n\nimplicates two distinct dischargeability \"exceptions.\"\n\n\n                                           12\n\f            First, a debtor represented by counsel may reaffirm any\n\nlawful debt by entering into a written reaffirmation agreement\n\nwhich     strictly   comports        with    the     criteria      prescribed        in\n\nBankruptcy Code § 524(c).            The mandated criteria require that\n\nthe     reaffirmation      agreement        (i)    be    executed        before      the\n\nsubsection    727(a)       discharge    has       been   granted;    (ii)       be    in\n\nconsideration for a dischargeable debt, whether or not the\n\ndebtor waived discharge of the debt; (iii) include clear and\n\nconspicuous     statements      that        the    debtor    may     rescind         the\n\nreaffirmation agreement at any time prior to the granting of the\n\ngeneral discharge, or within sixty days after the execution of\n\nthe reaffirmation agreement, whichever occurs later, and that\n\nreaffirmation is neither required by the Bankruptcy Code nor by\n\nnonbankruptcy law; (iv) be filed with the bankruptcy court; and\n\n(v) be accompanied by an affidavit of the debtor's attorney\n\nattesting    that    the    debtor     was    fully      advised    of    the     legal\n\nconsequences of the reaffirmation agreement, that the debtor\n\nexecuted the reaffirmation agreement knowingly and voluntarily,\n\nand that the reaffirmation agreement would not cause the debtor\n\n\"undue [e.g., financial] hardship.\"                Id. § 524(c).4\n\n\n      4\n     These detailed prophylactic measures were designed to\nprotect unwitting debtors from creditors bent on coercing\nreaffirmations   in   relation   to   otherwise    dischargeable\nprepetition debts, see In re Turner, 156 F.3d 713, 718 (7th Cir.\n1998) (\"A reaffirmation agreement is the only vehicle through\n\n                                        13\n\f            An entirely voluntary, fully informed reaffirmation\n\nagreement meeting the demanding requirements of Bankruptcy Code\n\n§ 524 enables a creditor to undertake all lawful efforts to\n\nrecover a reaffirmed debt as though no petition in bankruptcy\n\nhad been filed.    See Ripple v. Boston Whaler Fin. Servs. (In re\n\nRipple), 242 B.R. 60, 64 (Bankr. M.D. Fla. 1999).       Otherwise, a\n\nreaffirmation agreement is void and unenforceable.      See Bessette\n\nv.

See\n\nGrogan v. Garner, 498 U.S. 279, 286-87 (1991); Seton Hall Univ.\n\nv. Van Ess (In re Van Ess), 186 B.R. 375, 377-78 (Bankr.

The\n\nLaRoche reaffirmation agreement purported to serve two distinct\n\nends:    (A) LaRoche promised to submit a subsection 524(c) motion\n\nto \"confirm\" (viz., reaffirm) the prepetition obligation to\n\nreimburse appellants for the \"shortfall amount,\" presumably\n\nbecause that indebtedness (i) had not yet been converted to a\n\ncontingent civil \"fine\" or penalty; (ii) would not qualify for\n\nan exception to discharge under subsection 523(a)(7); and (iii)\n\npresumptively    would     be     covered     by   a    general   discharge     in\n\nbankruptcy;    and   (B)    the    reaffirmation         agreement      explicitly\n\nstipulated that should LaRoche default on his reaffirmation\n\nagreement with regard to the \"shortfall amount,\" the \"shortfall\n\namount\" would become a nondischargeable civil penalty under\n\nsubsection 523(a)(7).\n\n\n                                       16\n\f             Appellants correctly refrain from contending that the\n\nfirst component of the CWA/RIWPCA consent decree (i.e., the\n\nreaffirmation provision relating to the \"shortfall amount\") is\n\nenforceable,       since    the    consent     decree    did      not    include    the\n\nrequisite     clear   and    conspicuous          statement       either    informing\n\nLaRoche that he could rescind the reaffirmation agreement or\n\nthat    reaffirmation        was    not      obligatory       under       either     the\n\nBankruptcy Code or applicable nonbankruptcy law.                        Moreover, the\n\ndebt reaffirmation provision contained no representation that\n\nreaffirmation       would     not     cause       LaRoche     \"undue       hardship.\"\n\nAccordingly, even if a timely motion to reaffirm the \"shortfall\n\namount\" indebtedness had been submitted by LaRoche, see supra\n\nnote 3, it would not have been allowable.\n\n             Yet the district court ruled as well that appellants'\n\nright   to    recover       the     civil      penalty      had    been     forfeited\n\nirretrievably — after the bankruptcy court rejected the LaRoche\n\nmotion to reaffirm — due to either (i) their deliberate refusal\n\nto intervene in the reaffirmation proceeding for the purpose of\n\nsubmitting     a    motion    to     amend     the   bankruptcy         court      order\n\ndisallowing the reaffirmation, but see supra note 1, and/or (ii)\n\ntheir failure to commence an adversary proceeding to obtain a\n\njudicial     determination         that     the    contingent       civil     penalty\n\nasserted against LaRoche was nondischargeable under Bankruptcy\n\n\n                                          17\n\fCode § 523(a)(7).              These district court rulings constituted\n\nreversible error.\n\n              A creditor intent on establishing that its claim is\n\nexcepted from discharge, i.e., nondischargeable under Bankruptcy\n\nCode § 523(a)(2), (4), (6) or (15), must commence a timely\n\nadversary proceeding to determine dischargeability vel non;\n\notherwise, the nondischargeability issue is deemed waived.                     See\n\n11   U.S.C.       §   523(c)(1)    (prescribing       that   creditor   asserting\n\nnondischargeability, under Bankruptcy Code § 523(a)(2), (4), (6)\n\nor (15), must litigate issue in bankruptcy court, or else the\n\n\"debtor shall be discharged from [the] debt\"); In re Walker, 195\n\nB.R. 187, 190 n.3, 195 (Bankr. D.N.H. 1996); 4 Collier on\n\nBankruptcy ¶ 523.26, at 523-11.\n\n              On the other hand, creditors relying upon any of the\n\ntwelve other exceptions to discharge prescribed in Bankruptcy\n\nCode    §   523(a),      including       subsection    523(a)(7),   may     seek   a\n\nnondischargeability determination in the bankruptcy court, but\n\nare not required to do so.               See In re Walker, 195 B.R. at 195;\n\nFed. R. Bankr. P. 4007(a) (\"A debtor or any creditor may file a\n\ncomplaint to obtain a determination of the dischargeability of\n\nany debt.\").          Thus, bankruptcy courts and nonbankruptcy courts\n\nalike       are       vested      with     concurrent        jurisdiction     over\n\nnondischargeability proceedings arising under Bankruptcy Code §\n\n\n                                           18\n\f523(a)(7).      Consequently, at their option, creditors seeking a\n\nnondischargeability         determination         need   not    submit      to     the\n\njurisdiction of the bankruptcy court, but instead may invoke the\n\njurisdiction     of   any    appropriate      nonbankruptcy         forum    either\n\nbefore or after the bankruptcy proceeding has been closed.                        See,\n\ne.g., In re Walker, 195 B.R. at 203-04; Royal Am. Oil & Gas Co.\n\nv. Szafranski (In re Szafranski), 147 B.R. 976, 981 (Bankr. N.D.\n\nOkla. 1992); Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4007(b) (\"A complaint other than\n\nunder § 523(c) may be filed at any time.\")5\n\n           At the time the bankruptcy court disallowed LaRoche's\n\nmotion to reaffirm the indebtedness relating to the \"shortfall\n\namount,\" the most extensive conceivable scope of its ruling\n\nwould have been that any attempt to reaffirm the indebtedness\n\nfor the \"shortfall amount\" — the one and only issue LaRoche was\n\ncontractually obligated to raise — was a nullity.                      Thus, the\n\nbankruptcy court ruling stands only for the proposition that the\n\nreaffirmation effort undertaken by LaRoche did not render the\n\n\"shortfall amount\" indebtedness              de facto        \"nondischargeable.\"\n\nSee   In   re    Ripple,     242     B.R.    at    64    (noting     that        where\n\nreaffirmation     agreement        meets    rigorous     §    524   requirements,\n\n\n\n\n      5\n      Assuming arguendo that LaRoche might have opted to \"remove\"\nthe case from the nonbankruptcy forum to the bankruptcy court,\nsee In re Galbreath, 83 B.R. at 551, he did not elect to do so.\n\n                                       19\n\fcreditor may recover reaffirmed debt as though debtor never\n\nfiled bankruptcy petition).\n\n            As appellants correctly point out, the bankruptcy court\n\nruling which disallowed the motion to reaffirm filed by LaRoche\n\nnever   purported     to    resolve        the    altogether         distinct     matter\n\nrelating to the dischargeability of the contingent civil penalty\n\nunder Bankruptcy Code § 523(a)(7).                 And since LaRoche commenced\n\nno adversary proceeding relating to the dischargeability of the\n\ncontingent civil penalty, appellants were free to forego their\n\nown adversary proceeding.              Consequently, their decision not to\n\nintervene, notwithstanding the bankruptcy court's invitation,\n\ndid not forfeit their right to litigate the subsection 523(a)(7)\n\nnondischargeability issue at some later date in an appropriate\n\nnonbankruptcy forum, viz., the United States District Court for\n\nthe District of Rhode Island, which had retained jurisdiction\n\nfor   the   purpose    of    monitoring           the       implementation        of   the\n\nCWA/RIWPCA consent decree.\n\n            Accordingly,         at    the    present           juncture   this   appeal\n\nreduces to two principal issues:                   (i) whether the CWA/RIWPCA\n\nconsent     decree    constituted            either         a    binding    contractual\n\nagreement    between       the    parties         or    a       controlling    judicial\n\ndetermination    —    in    or    by   a     nonbankruptcy          forum     possessing\n\nconcurrent jurisdiction — that the contingent civil penalty\n\n\n                                             20\n\fimposed upon LaRoche is nondischargeable under Bankruptcy Code\n\n§ 523(a)(7); and (ii) if not, whether the district court ruling\n\nthat the civil penalty is dischargeable should be affirmed on\n\nother   grounds    apparent    from    the   record    on   appeal,      see\n\nSpenlinhauer v. O'Donnell, 261 F.3d 113, 117 (1st Cir. 2001),\n\nor, (iii) whether the record on appeal is sufficiently developed\n\nto enable a de novo determination by this court, as to whether\n\nappellants   are    entitled     to    assert    their      claim   to     a\n\nnondischargeability exception under subsection 523(a)(7), see\n\nWarfel, 268 B.R. at 209, thereby obviating a remand.\n\n          The CWA/RIWPCA consent decree unambiguously expunged\n\nwhatever prospective legal entitlement LaRoche may have had to\n\nreceive a discharge from the civil penalty.6          To be sure, on rare\n\noccasions courts have either declined on public policy grounds\n\nto enforce prebankruptcy waivers of a discharge in bankruptcy,\n\nor have ruled that prebankruptcy waivers must strictly comport\n\nwith the reaffirmation requirements prescribed by Bankruptcy\n\nCode § 524(c).    See, e.g., Hayhoe v. Cole (In re Cole), 226 B.R.\n\n647, 652-53 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 1998); In re Mascoll, 246 B.R. at\n\n\n    6A consent decree is a hybrid, consisting of a contractual\nagreement among the parties to the dispute, as well as a\njudicial imprimitur enforceable through the contempt power. See\nMartin v. Wilks, 490 U.S. 755, 788 n.27 (1989). In all events,\nthe question as to whether LaRoche waived any contention\nrelating to the dischargeability of the civil penalty poses a\nlegal issue subject to de novo review.

And since any creditor may opt to litigate, in an\n\nappropriate nonbankruptcy forum, its asserted entitlement to an\n\nexception      from       discharge,        a    debtor's     voluntary     waiver    of\n\nobjection       to        such      a   dischargeability            exception    in    a\n\nnonbankruptcy forum would appear to offend no established policy\n\nfostered by the Bankruptcy Code.

(BNA), No. 5, 124, at 139 (Jan.\n30, 1997)).\n\n                                                23\n\fstipulates to judgment, should not be bound by the obligations\n\nundertaken in the consent decree, which obligations plainly\n\nconstituted the consideration that prompted appellants to settle\n\ntheir nondischargeability action against him.9\n\n                 Furthermore, even assuming LaRoche may have realized\n\nsome         perceived      advantage         had      he    litigated       the\n\nnondischargeability issue in the bankruptcy court, presumably he\n\nwas free in 1991 either to \"remove\" the nondischargeability\n\naction to the bankruptcy court, see supra note 5, or to commence\n\nan adversary proceeding for a declaratory judgment that the debt\n\ndid not qualify for subsection 523(a)(7) treatment, see Fed. R.\n\nBankr. 4007(a).          Nevertheless, LaRoche did neither, preferring\n\ninstead to wait six years before complying with his promise to\n\nprovide the \"expeditious\" and good faith reaffirmation agreement\n\nrequired under the 1991 consent decree.                     Cf. Richardson v.\n\nChrysler First Fin. Servs. Corp. (In re Richardson), 102 B.R.\n\n254,       256   (Bankr.

See, e.g., In re Saler, 205 B.R. at 744 n.5 (noting\nthat earlier consent decree, whose terms were sufficiently\ndetailed, may have been entitled to collateral estoppel effect,\nthereby barring litigation of factual matters in subsequent\nnondischargeability litigation).\n\n                                         24\n\fwas estopped from asserting unenforceability where creditor\n\nreasonably refrained from filing timely § 523(a)(2) adversary\n\nproceeding in reliance on debtor's earlier waiver).\n\n           Accordingly, in the present circumstances we need not\n\nconsider   whether       appellants     may    have   been     entitled    to    a\n\nnondischargeability       determination        with   regard    to   the   civil\n\npenalty under Bankruptcy Code § 523(a)(7), nor whether any such\n\ncivil penalty qualified for a nondischargeability exception as\n\n\"compensation      for     actual     pecuniary       loss\"     sustained       by\n\nappellants.      Consequently, we announce no sweeping rule of law\n\nregarding the validity of prepetition waivers of discharge,\n\nespecially    since     these    matters      are   almost    invariably    best\n\nassessed on a case-by-case basis.               Instead, we conclude that\n\nbecause    the    district      court    plainly      possessed      concurrent\n\njurisdiction     over    the    subsection     523(a)(7)      dischargeability\n\nissue in 1991, when it approved the consent decree, LaRoche\n\ncannot now be heard to contend that the general discharge he was\n\ngranted in 1995 relieved him of liability for the civil penalty.\n\n           Accordingly, the district court judgment is vacated and\n\nthe case is remanded for the entry of judgment for appellants;\n\ncosts to be borne by appellees.\n\n           SO ORDERED.\n\n\n\n\n                                        25\n\f",

We vacate and remand, with directions that judgment enter for appellants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p>* BACKGROUND</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1988, appellants joined in citizen lawsuits brought against LaRoche in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island, claiming violations of the Clean Water Act (\"CWA\"), 33 U.S.C. &#167; 1251 et seq., and the Rhode Island Water Pollution Control Act (\"RIWPCA\"), R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 46-12-1 et seq. (the \"CWA/RIWPCA action\"). Ultimately, the district court entered partial summary judgment for appellants, after determining that LaRoche had known, prior to purchasing the property, that its faulty septic system was polluting an adjacent river. See Friends of Sakonnet v. Dutra, 738 F. Supp. 623 (D.R.I. 1990). The amount of the remedial damages award against LaRoche remained unresolved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Creditors instituted involuntary chapter 11 reorganization proceedings against LaRoche in January 1991; the order for relief was entered in February 1991, see In re LaRoche, 969 F.2d 1299, 1300 (1st Cir. 1992), and the chapter 11 trustee was appointed on June 4, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, the parties had negotiated a settlement of all the remedial issues in the CWA/RIWPCA action pending before the federal district court. Whereupon the district court entered a consent decree, which stated, inter alia: \"The intention of the parties is to resolve any pending disputes arising out of this matter. The only responsibilities and obligations that will survive are those set forth in this Stipulation.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, a special master was appointed to marshal a settlement fund from the State and the former owners of the LaRoche property for the purpose of acquiring an adjacent tract of land upon which to construct a new waste water collection and treatment facility. Any excess acreage, over and above that required for the new facility, was to be sold to cover related project costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LaRoche agreed to reimburse the State for any \"shortfall amount,\" defined as the difference between ninety percent of the cost of the new waste water collection and treatment facility and the net proceeds from the sale of any excess acreage. In addition, LaRoche promised to \"affirm his obligation to pay the [shortfall amount], to the extent then unpaid, as a debt not discharged in any bankruptcy proceeding in which he is the bankrupt whether now pending or hereafter filed.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Finally, LaRoche pledged to \"procure an order of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Rhode Island in [his involuntary bankruptcy proceeding] affirming his obligation to pay the [shortfall amount] and to perform his other obligations hereunder.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All parties agreed to proceed \"expeditiously\" and \"in good faith\" with their respective obligations under the consent decree, which further provided as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LaRoche hereby agrees to the imposition of a civil penalty under the Rhode Island Water Pollution Control Act and regulations issued thereunder equal to the [shortfall amount]. DEM and the Attorney General agree that the imposition of such civil penalty will be stayed for so long as LaRoche complies with his obligations under Section II.3.C of this Stipulation [viz., to seek reaffirmation of his obligation to pay this debt in his involuntary bankruptcy case] and/or for so long as any order procured from the Bankruptcy Court under Section II.3.D [viz., an order approving LaRoche's reaffirmation of his prepetition debt] remains in effect. LaRoche specifically agrees that the civil penalty imposed hereunder constitutes a debt for a fine, penalty or forfeiture payable to and for the benefit of a governmental unit, is not compensation for actual pecuniary loss and is specifically non-dischargeable under 11 U.S.C. [&#167;] 523(a)(7).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added.) The district court explicitly retained \"continuing jurisdiction over this Stipulation and the performance of the parties hereto.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although LaRoche was granted a chapter 7 discharge, see 11 U.S.C. &#167; 727,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> on March 3, 1995, it was more than two years later, on April 10, 1997, before he finally submitted a motion to reaffirm the \"shortfall amount\" indebtedness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a hearing which appellants elected not to attend, the bankruptcy court rejected the motion to reaffirm submitted by LaRoche.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> At the same time, the bankruptcy court expressed concern that its rejection of the motion to reaffirm might obstruct the State's efforts to recover the \"shortfall amount.\" Accordingly, the bankruptcy court directed that its order -- rejecting LaRoche's motion to reaffirm the \"shortfall amount\" indebtedness -- be served upon all parties to the CWA/RIWPCA consent decree and \"[t]hat all entities who oppose the entry of this Order shall have ten (10) days from the entry of this Order within which to file a motion under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9023 to alter and amend this Order.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants elected not to submit a Rule 9023 motion, opting instead for a motion before the district court (which had retained jurisdiction over the CWA/RIWPCA consent decree) seeking a judicial declaration that LaRoche had breached the reaffirmation agreement, thereby rendering himself liable for the alternative civil penalty in a sum equal to the \"shortfall amount,\" estimated at more than one million dollars. LaRoche responded that (i) the consent decree was void and unenforceable due to appellants' failure to comply with the prerequisites to reaffirmation, see Bankruptcy Code &#167; 524(c), 11 U.S.C. &#167; 524(c), and (ii) consequently, the general discharge he was granted relieved him of all liabilities, including those asserted by appellants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For their part, appellants argued that the consent decree itself expressly defined the civil penalty imposed upon LaRoche as a fine payable to and for the benefit of a governmental unit, rather than as compensation for actual pecuniary loss. Accordingly, appellants contended, the civil penalty imposed against LaRoche was rendered nondischargeable as a matter of law. See id. &#167; 523(a)(7).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, the district court determined that the characterization which the consent decree ascribed to the LaRoche indebtedness for the civil penalty in the shortfall amount -- viz., a nondischargeable \"civil penalty\" -- was not conclusive. Consequently, the district court opined, in order to safeguard their rights it was incumbent upon appellants not only to have submitted a proof of claim, but also to have commenced an adversary proceeding to obtain a bankruptcy court ruling that the LaRoche indebtedness for the shortfall amount was a nondischargeable civil penalty. Failing that, the district court reasoned, the general discharge in bankruptcy granted LaRoche in the bankruptcy court presumptively discharged the civil penalty in the \"shortfall amount\" as contemplated by the CWA/RIWPCA consent decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants contend that the explicit language employed in the CWA/RIWPCA consent decree -- triggering a contingent \"civil penalty\" if and whenever LaRoche were to default on his obligation to procure bankruptcy court approval of the reaffirmation agreement relating to the \"shortfall amount\" indebtedness to appellants -- rendered the civil penalty nondischargeable under Bankruptcy Code &#167; 523(a)(7), 11 U.S.C. &#167; 523(a)(7). Accordingly, appellants insist, the interpretation the district court ascribed to the CWA/RIWPCA consent decree contravened the \"law of the case\" doctrine, which \"makes binding upon a court a ruling made [in] the same . . . level [of court] during prior stages of the same litigation.\" Lacy v. Gardino, 791 F.2d 980, 984 (1st Cir. 1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruling -- viz., that appellants failed either to establish or preserve their entitlement to a judicial determination that their claim was excepted from discharge -- presents us with a mixed question of law and fact subject to de novo review. See, e.g., Warfel v. City of Saratoga, 268 B.R. 205, 209 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 2001) (noting that dischargeability exceptions under &#167; 523(a)(7) normally turn upon whether undisputed facts fit pertinent legal rule). Similarly, a judicial interpretation of the terms of a consent decree is subject to plenary review. See Braxton v. United States, 500 U.S. 344, 350 (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bankruptcy Code &#167; 523(a)(7) excepts from discharge in bankruptcy any debt \"for a fine, penalty, or forfeiture payable to and for the benefit of a governmental unit, [which] is not compensation for actual pecuniary loss.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 523(a)(7). Thus, in order to establish that the instant consent decree imposed a nondischargeable obligation upon LaRoche, appellants needed to establish that their claim was based on (i) a \"fine, penalty, or forfeiture,\" (ii) \"payable to and for the benefit of a governmental unit,\" and (iii) \"not compensation for actual pecuniary loss.\" Id. Were appellants required to relitigate the dischargeability issue de novo, there may well have been substantial impediments to overcome. We explain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Bankruptcy Code &#167; 523(a)(7) applies both to civil and criminal penalties, see U.S. Dep't of Hous. &amp; Urban Dev. v. Cost Control Mktg. &amp; Sales Mgmt. of Va., Inc., 64 F.3d 920, 927-28 (4th Cir. 1995), in order to qualify for a dischargeability exception under subsection 523(a)(7), normally the particular penalty must serve some \"punitive\" or \"rehabilitative\" governmental aim, rather than a purely compensatory purpose. See Kelly v. Robinson, 479 U.S. 36, 52 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants contend that these civil penalties, imposed pursuant to Rhode Island law, see R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 46-12-13, were designed to deter and remediate environmental contamination, a particularly important governmental function implemented under the State's police and regulatory powers. Moreover, appellants argue, LaRoche potentially was exposed to fines up to $25,000 per day, a sum which bears neither any obvious nor essential correlation to the amount needed to compensate the State for its actual response costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, there can be no question but that the consent decree itself explicitly equates the amount of these civil penalties with the \"shortfall amount,\" which in turn plainly was designed to reimburse the State for its actual losses, neither more nor less. Appellants respond, however, that their decision to calculate the punitive fines under that convenient methodology cannot deprive these civil penalties of their \"punitive\" nature. See, e.g., State Bar of Mich. v. Doerr (In re Doerr), 185 B.R. 533, 536-37 (Bankr. W.D. Mich. 1995). We need not resolve these issues, however, since the CWA/RIWPCA consent decree itself disposes of the contention that appellants' claim is excepted from discharge under Bankruptcy Code &#167; 523(a)(7).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the district court erred, as a matter of law, in ruling that appellants forfeited their rights by not commencing a timely adversary proceeding to determine the dischargeability of these debts while the LaRoche bankruptcy proceeding was pending. Normally, the Bankruptcy Code enables a debtor to obtain a discharge \"from all debts that arose before the date of the order for relief.\" Bankruptcy Code &#167; 727(b); see also id. &#167; 524(a). Any claim for environmental contamination asserted against LaRoche plainly arose prior to the chapter 11 petition. See id. &#167; 101(5) (defining \"claim\" as a \"right to payment, whether or not such right is reduced to judgment, . . . fixed, [or] contingent\"). Consequently, absent exceptional circumstances not present here, any liability incurred for environmental contamination would have been extinguished by the discharge in bankruptcy LaRoche obtained in 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, under the terms of the consent decree, LaRoche became liable to appellants for two distinct debts: the \"shortfall amount\" and the contingent civil penalty. Thus, as appellants correctly point out, the present case implicates two distinct dischargeability \"exceptions.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, a debtor represented by counsel may reaffirm any lawful debt by entering into a written reaffirmation agreement which strictly comports with the criteria prescribed in Bankruptcy Code &#167; 524(c). The mandated criteria require that the reaffirmation agreement (i) be executed before the subsection 727(a) discharge has been granted; (ii) be in consideration for a dischargeable debt, whether or not the debtor waived discharge of the debt; (iii) include clear and conspicuous statements that the debtor may rescind the reaffirmation agreement at any time prior to the granting of the general discharge, or within sixty days after the execution of the reaffirmation agreement, whichever occurs later, and that reaffirmation is neither required by the Bankruptcy Code nor by nonbankruptcy law; (iv) be filed with the bankruptcy court; and (v) be accompanied by an affidavit of the debtor's attorney attesting that the debtor was fully advised of the legal consequences of the reaffirmation agreement, that the debtor executed the reaffirmation agreement knowingly and voluntarily, and that the reaffirmation agreement would not cause the debtor \"undue [e.g., financial] hardship.\" Id. &#167; 524(c).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An entirely voluntary, fully informed reaffirmation agreement meeting the demanding requirements of Bankruptcy Code &#167; 524 enables a creditor to undertake all lawful efforts to recover a reaffirmed debt as though no petition in bankruptcy had been filed. See Ripple v. Boston Whaler Fin. Servs. (In re Ripple), 242 B.R. 60, 64 (Bankr. M.D. Fla. 1999). Otherwise, a reaffirmation agreement is void and unenforceable. See Bessette v. Avco Fin. Servs., 230 F.3d 439, 443-44 (1st Cir. 2000); see also Bassett v. Am. Gen. Fin., Inc. (In re Bassett), 255 B.R. 747, 751 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The consent decree in the instant case required that LaRoche submit a motion to reaffirm only the non-\"penalty\" debt for the \"shortfall amount\" (\"non-penalty shortfall debt\"). Unlike the contingent civil penalty, which was stayed, the \"non-penalty shortfall debt\" presumptively constituted a dischargeable debt; that is, one which could not be excepted from discharge unless LaRoche entered into a valid agreement to reaffirm it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, and altogether apart from whether a particular reaffirmation agreement is enforceable, an eligible creditor may be entitled to invoke any one or more among the sixteen exceptions to discharge enumerated in Bankruptcy Code &#167; 523(a). In this connection, appellants once again posit that the alternative civil penalty contemplated by the CWA/RIWPCA consent decree came within an exception to discharge, since it \"is for a fine, penalty or forfeiture payable to and for the benefit of a governmental unit, and is not compensation for actual pecuniary loss.\" Bankruptcy Code &#167; 523(a)(7); 11 U.S.C. &#167; 523(a)(7).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike motions to reaffirm, which may be filed only by debtors, see supra note 1, either a debtor or a creditor may commence an adversary proceeding to determine the dischargeability vel non of a debt under subsection 523(a). See Galbreath v. Ill. Dep't. of Rev. (In re Galbreath), 83 B.R. 549, 551 (Bankr. S.D. Ill. 1988) (citing Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4007(a) and 7001(6)). The fundamental \"fresh start\" policy underlying the Bankruptcy Code requires that the exceptions to discharge prescribed in subsection 523(a) be narrowly construed by the courts, and established by a preponderance of the evidence by the claimant asserting the dischargeability exception. See Grogan v. Garner, 498 U.S. 279, 286-87 (1991); Seton Hall Univ. v. Van Ess (In re Van Ess), 186 B.R. 375, 377-78 (Bankr. D.N.J. 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Bankruptcy Code sections 523 and 524 frequently overlap in application, each entails discrete criteria and procedures pertinent to the instant case. The LaRoche reaffirmation agreement purported to serve two distinct ends: (A) LaRoche promised to submit a subsection 524(c) motion to \"confirm\" (viz., reaffirm) the prepetition obligation to reimburse appellants for the \"shortfall amount,\" presumably because that indebtedness (i) had not yet been converted to a contingent civil \"fine\" or penalty; (ii) would not qualify for an exception to discharge under subsection 523(a)(7); and (iii) presumptively would be covered by a general discharge in bankruptcy; and (B) the reaffirmation agreement explicitly stipulated that should LaRoche default on his reaffirmation agreement with regard to the \"shortfall amount,\" the \"shortfall amount\" would become a nondischargeable civil penalty under subsection 523(a)(7).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants correctly refrain from contending that the first component of the CWA/RIWPCA consent decree (i.e., the reaffirmation provision relating to the \"shortfall amount\") is enforceable, since the consent decree did not include the requisite clear and conspicuous statement either informing LaRoche that he could rescind the reaffirmation agreement or that reaffirmation was not obligatory under either the Bankruptcy Code or applicable nonbankruptcy law. Moreover, the debt reaffirmation provision contained no representation that reaffirmation would not cause LaRoche \"undue hardship.\" Accordingly, even if a timely motion to reaffirm the \"shortfall amount\" indebtedness had been submitted by LaRoche, see supra note 3, it would not have been allowable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet the district court ruled as well that appellants' right to recover the civil penalty had been forfeited irretrievably -- after the bankruptcy court rejected the LaRoche motion to reaffirm -- due to either (i) their deliberate refusal to intervene in the reaffirmation proceeding for the purpose of submitting a motion to amend the bankruptcy court order disallowing the reaffirmation, but see supra note 1, and/or (ii) their failure to commence an adversary proceeding to obtain a judicial determination that the contingent civil penalty asserted against LaRoche was nondischargeable under Bankruptcy Code &#167; 523(a)(7). These district court rulings constituted reversible error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A creditor intent on establishing that its claim is excepted from discharge, i.e., nondischargeable under Bankruptcy Code &#167; 523(a)(2), (4), (6) or (15), must commence a timely adversary proceeding to determine dischargeability vel non; otherwise, the nondischargeability issue is deemed waived. See 11 U.S.C. &#167; 523(c)(1) (prescribing that creditor asserting nondischargeability, under Bankruptcy Code &#167; 523(a)(2), (4), (6) or (15), must litigate issue in bankruptcy court, or else the \"debtor shall be discharged from [the] debt\"); In re Walker, 195 B.R. 187, 190 n.3, 195 (Bankr. D.N.H. 1996); 4 Collier on Bankruptcy &#182; 523.26, at 523-11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, creditors relying upon any of the twelve other exceptions to discharge prescribed in Bankruptcy Code &#167; 523(a), including subsection 523(a)(7), may seek a nondischargeability determination in the bankruptcy court, but are not required to do so. See In re Walker, 195 B.R. at 195; Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4007(a) (\"A debtor or any creditor may file a complaint to obtain a determination of the dischargeability of any debt.\"). Thus, bankruptcy courts and nonbankruptcy courts alike are vested with concurrent jurisdiction over nondischargeability proceedings arising under Bankruptcy Code &#167; 523(a)(7). Consequently, at their option, creditors seeking a nondischargeability determination need not submit to the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court, but instead may invoke the jurisdiction of any appropriate nonbankruptcy forum either before or after the bankruptcy proceeding has been closed. See, e.g., In re Walker, 195 B.R. at 203-04; Royal Am. Oil &amp; Gas Co. v. Szafranski (In re Szafranski), 147 B.R. 976, 981 (Bankr. N.D. Okla. 1992); Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4007(b) (\"A complaint other than under &#167; 523(c) may be filed at any time.\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time the bankruptcy court disallowed LaRoche's motion to reaffirm the indebtedness relating to the \"shortfall amount,\" the most extensive conceivable scope of its ruling would have been that any attempt to reaffirm the indebtedness for the \"shortfall amount\" -- the one and only issue LaRoche was contractually obligated to raise -- was a nullity. Thus, the bankruptcy court ruling stands only for the proposition that the reaffirmation effort undertaken by LaRoche did not render the \"shortfall amount\" indebtedness de facto \"nondischargeable.\" See In re Ripple, 242 B.R. at 64 (noting that where reaffirmation agreement meets rigorous &#167; 524 requirements, creditor may recover reaffirmed debt as though debtor never filed bankruptcy petition).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As appellants correctly point out, the bankruptcy court ruling which disallowed the motion to reaffirm filed by LaRoche never purported to resolve the altogether distinct matter relating to the dischargeability of the contingent civil penalty under Bankruptcy Code &#167; 523(a)(7). And since LaRoche commenced no adversary proceeding relating to the dischargeability of the contingent civil penalty, appellants were free to forego their own adversary proceeding. Consequently, their decision not to intervene, notwithstanding the bankruptcy court's invitation, did not forfeit their right to litigate the subsection 523(a)(7) nondischargeability issue at some later date in an appropriate nonbankruptcy forum, viz., the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island, which had retained jurisdiction for the purpose of monitoring the implementation of the CWA/RIWPCA consent decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, at the present juncture this appeal reduces to two principal issues: (i) whether the CWA/RIWPCA consent decree constituted either a binding contractual agreement between the parties or a controlling judicial determination -- in or by a nonbankruptcy forum possessing concurrent jurisdiction -- that the contingent civil penalty imposed upon LaRoche is nondischargeable under Bankruptcy Code &#167; 523(a)(7); and (ii) if not, whether the district court ruling that the civil penalty is dischargeable should be affirmed on other grounds apparent from the record on appeal, see Spenlinhauer v. O'Donnell, 261 F.3d 113, 117 (1st Cir. 2001), or, (iii) whether the record on appeal is sufficiently developed to enable a de novo determination by this court, as to whether appellants are entitled to assert their claim to a nondischargeability exception under subsection 523(a)(7), see Warfel, 268 B.R. at 209, thereby obviating a remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The CWA/RIWPCA consent decree unambiguously expunged whatever prospective legal entitlement LaRoche may have had to receive a discharge from the civil penalty.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> To be sure, on rare occasions courts have either declined on public policy grounds to enforce prebankruptcy waivers of a discharge in bankruptcy, or have ruled that prebankruptcy waivers must strictly comport with the reaffirmation requirements prescribed by Bankruptcy Code &#167; 524(c). See, e.g., Hayhoe v. Cole (In re Cole), 226 B.R. 647, 652-53 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 1998); In re Mascoll, 246 B.R. at 700-01; In re James, 120 B.R. 582, 585-86 (Bankr. W.D. Okla. 1990); In re Hirte, 71 B.R. 249, 250 (Bankr. D. Ore. 1986); cf. In re Catron, 186 B.R. 194, 196 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1995) (extending same rule to postpetition waiver of discharge obtained in nonbankruptcy forum, such as state court).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, these decisions invariably involved the four \"waivable\" exceptions to discharge identified in Bankruptcy Code &#167; 523(a)(2), (4), (6), and (15), over which the bankruptcy court exercises exclusive jurisdiction. See In re Cole, 226 B.R. at 649, 653, 656 (explicitly justifying its holding on ground that \"bankruptcy courts have exclusive jurisdiction to determine the dischargeability of claims arising under &#167; 523(a)(2),\" and refusing to accord collateral estoppel effect to stipulated judgment because state court which entered it clearly lacked jurisdiction to determine underlying facts necessary to resolve &#167; 523(a) issue); In re Mascoll, 246 B.R. at 701, 706 (&#167; 523(a)(2)); In re James, 120 B.R. at 584 (&#167; 523(a)(2)); In re Hirte, 71 B.R. at 250 (noting that claimant's nondischargeability complaint was time-barred by &#167; 523(c)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where an asserted exception to discharge relies upon none of the four waivable exceptions to discharge, however, the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court is concurrent, hence nonexclusive. And since any creditor may opt to litigate, in an appropriate nonbankruptcy forum, its asserted entitlement to an exception from discharge, a debtor's voluntary waiver of objection to such a dischargeability exception in a nonbankruptcy forum would appear to offend no established policy fostered by the Bankruptcy Code. See Saler v. Saler (In re Saler), 205 B.R. 737, 746-47 (Bankr. E.D. Pa. 1997) (holding that debtor's earlier settlement of nondischargeability litigation of &#167; 523(a)(5) exemption did not constitute \"reaffirmation\"; consequently, &#167; 524(c), by its terms, held inapplicable), aff'd, 217 B.R. 166 (E.D. Pa. 1998); see also Pope v. Wagner (In re Pope), 209 B.R. 1015, 1019 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1997); cf. In re Cole, 226 B.R. at 652 (distinguishing Saler on this ground).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Thus, we can discern no sound reason that LaRoche, like any other litigant who knowingly and voluntarily stipulates to judgment, should not be bound by the obligations undertaken in the consent decree, which obligations plainly constituted the consideration that prompted appellants to settle their nondischargeability action against him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, even assuming LaRoche may have realized some perceived advantage had he litigated the nondischargeability issue in the bankruptcy court, presumably he was free in 1991 either to \"remove\" the nondischargeability action to the bankruptcy court, see supra note 5, or to commence an adversary proceeding for a declaratory judgment that the debt did not qualify for subsection 523(a)(7) treatment, see Fed. R. Bankr. 4007(a). Nevertheless, LaRoche did neither, preferring instead to wait six years before complying with his promise to provide the \"expeditious\" and good faith reaffirmation agreement required under the 1991 consent decree. Cf. Richardson v. Chrysler First Fin. Servs. Corp. (In re Richardson), 102 B.R. 254, 256 (Bankr. M.D. Fla. 1989) (determining that though reaffirmation agreement was unenforceable under &#167; 524(c), debtor was estopped from asserting unenforceability where creditor reasonably refrained from filing timely &#167; 523(a)(2) adversary proceeding in reliance on debtor's earlier waiver).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, in the present circumstances we need not consider whether appellants may have been entitled to a nondischargeability determination with regard to the civil penalty under Bankruptcy Code &#167; 523(a)(7), nor whether any such civil penalty qualified for a nondischargeability exception as \"compensation for actual pecuniary loss\" sustained by appellants. Consequently, we announce no sweeping rule of law regarding the validity of prepetition waivers of discharge, especially since these matters are almost invariably best assessed on a case-by-case basis. Instead, we conclude that because the district court plainly possessed concurrent jurisdiction over the subsection 523(a)(7) dischargeability issue in 1991, when it approved the consent decree, LaRoche cannot now be heard to contend that the general discharge he was granted in 1995 relieved him of liability for the civil penalty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the district court judgment is vacated and the case is remanded for the entry of judgment for appellants; costs to be borne by appellees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> By negative inference, from Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 4008 (\"A motion by the debtor for approval of a reaffirmation agreement shall be filed before or at the hearing.\"), only the chapter 7 debtor may request bankruptcy court approval of a reaffirmation agreement.

LaRoche responded that (i) the consent decree was void and unenforceable due to appellants' failure to comply with the prerequisites to reaffirmation, see Bankruptcy Code &#167; 524(c), 11 U.S.C. &#167; 524(c), and (ii) consequently, the general discharge he was granted relieved him of all liabilities, including those asserted by appellants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For their part, appellants argued that the consent decree itself expressly defined the civil penalty imposed upon LaRoche as a fine payable to and for the benefit of a governmental unit, rather than as compensation for actual pecuniary loss. Accordingly, appellants contended, the civil penalty imposed against LaRoche was rendered nondischargeable as a matter of law.

Consequently, the district court opined, in order to safeguard their rights it was incumbent upon appellants not only to have submitted a proof of claim, but also to have commenced an adversary proceeding to obtain a bankruptcy court ruling that the LaRoche indebtedness for the shortfall amount was a nondischargeable civil penalty. Failing that, the district court reasoned, the general discharge in bankruptcy granted LaRoche in the bankruptcy court presumptively discharged the civil penalty in the \"shortfall amount\" as contemplated by the CWA/RIWPCA consent decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants contend that the explicit language employed in the CWA/RIWPCA consent decree -- triggering a contingent \"civil penalty\" if and whenever LaRoche were to default on his obligation to procure bankruptcy court approval of the reaffirmation agreement relating to the \"shortfall amount\" indebtedness to appellants -- rendered the civil penalty nondischargeable under Bankruptcy Code &#167; 523(a)(7), 11 U.S.C. &#167; 523(a)(7). Accordingly, appellants insist, the interpretation the district court ascribed to the CWA/RIWPCA consent decree contravened the \"law of the case\" doctrine, which \"makes binding upon a court a ruling made [in] the same . . . level [of court] during prior stages of the same litigation.\" Lacy v.

Thus, in order to establish that the instant consent decree imposed a nondischargeable obligation upon LaRoche, appellants needed to establish that their claim was based on (i) a \"fine, penalty, or forfeiture,\" (ii) \"payable to and for the benefit of a governmental unit,\" and (iii) \"not compensation for actual pecuniary loss.\" Id.

See Kelly v.

Gen. Laws &#167; 46-12-13, were designed to deter and remediate environmental contamination, a particularly important governmental function implemented under the State's police and regulatory powers. Moreover, appellants argue, LaRoche potentially was exposed to fines up to $25,000 per day, a sum which bears neither any obvious nor essential correlation to the amount needed to compensate the State for its actual response costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, there can be no question but that the consent decree itself explicitly equates the amount of these civil penalties with the \"shortfall amount,\" which in turn plainly was designed to reimburse the State for its actual losses, neither more nor less. Appellants respond, however, that their decision to calculate the punitive fines under that convenient methodology cannot deprive these civil penalties of their \"punitive\" nature. See, e.g., State Bar of Mich. v. Doerr (In re Doerr), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1939194\"><a href=\"/opinion/1939194/in-re-doerr/\"><span class=\"volume\">185</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">533</span></a></span>, 536-37 (Bankr. W.D. Mich. 1995). We need not resolve these issues, however, since the CWA/RIWPCA consent decree itself disposes of the contention that appellants' claim is excepted from discharge under Bankruptcy Code &#167; 523(a)(7).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the district court erred, as a matter of law, in ruling that appellants forfeited their rights by not commencing a timely adversary proceeding to determine the dischargeability of these debts while the LaRoche bankruptcy proceeding was pending. Normally, the Bankruptcy Code enables a debtor to obtain a discharge \"from all debts that arose before the date of the order for relief.\" Bankruptcy Code &#167; 727(b); see also id. &#167; 524(a). Any claim for environmental contamination asserted against LaRoche plainly arose prior to the chapter 11 petition. See id. &#167; 101(5) (defining \"claim\" as a \"right to payment, whether or not such right is reduced to judgment, . . . fixed, [or] contingent\"). Consequently, absent exceptional circumstances not present here, any liability incurred for environmental contamination would have been extinguished by the discharge in bankruptcy LaRoche obtained in 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, under the terms of the consent decree, LaRoche became liable to appellants for two distinct debts: the \"shortfall amount\" and the contingent civil penalty. Thus, as appellants correctly point out, the present case implicates two distinct dischargeability \"exceptions.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, a debtor represented by counsel may reaffirm any lawful debt by entering into a written reaffirmation agreement which strictly comports with the criteria prescribed in Bankruptcy Code &#167; 524(c).

The LaRoche reaffirmation agreement purported to serve two distinct ends: (A) LaRoche promised to submit a subsection 524(c) motion to \"confirm\" (viz., reaffirm) the prepetition obligation to reimburse appellants for the \"shortfall amount,\" presumably because that indebtedness (i) had not yet been converted to a contingent civil \"fine\" or penalty; (ii) would not qualify for an exception to discharge under subsection 523(a)(7); and (iii) presumptively would be covered by a general discharge in bankruptcy; and (B) the reaffirmation agreement explicitly stipulated that should LaRoche default on his reaffirmation agreement with regard to the \"shortfall amount,\" the \"shortfall amount\" would become a nondischargeable civil penalty under subsection 523(a)(7).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants correctly refrain from contending that the first component of the CWA/RIWPCA consent decree (i.e., the reaffirmation provision relating to the \"shortfall amount\") is enforceable, since the consent decree did not include the requisite clear and conspicuous statement either informing LaRoche that he could rescind the reaffirmation agreement or that reaffirmation was not obligatory under either the Bankruptcy Code or applicable nonbankruptcy law. Moreover, the debt reaffirmation provision contained no representation that reaffirmation would not cause LaRoche \"undue hardship.\" Accordingly, even if a timely motion to reaffirm the \"shortfall amount\" indebtedness had been submitted by LaRoche, see supra note 3, it would not have been allowable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet the district court ruled as well that appellants' right to recover the civil penalty had been forfeited irretrievably -- after the bankruptcy court rejected the LaRoche motion to reaffirm -- due to either (i) their deliberate refusal to intervene in the reaffirmation proceeding for the purpose of submitting a motion to amend the bankruptcy court order disallowing the reaffirmation, but see supra note 1, and/or (ii) their failure to commence an adversary proceeding to obtain a judicial determination that the contingent civil penalty asserted against LaRoche was nondischargeable under Bankruptcy Code &#167; 523(a)(7). These district court rulings constituted reversible error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A creditor intent on establishing that its claim is excepted from discharge, i.e., nondischargeable under Bankruptcy Code &#167; 523(a)(2), (4), (6) or (15), must commence a timely adversary proceeding to determine dischargeability vel non; otherwise, the nondischargeability issue is deemed waived. See 11 U.S.C. &#167; 523(c)(1) (prescribing that creditor asserting nondischargeability, under Bankruptcy Code &#167; 523(a)(2), (4), (6) or (15), must litigate issue in bankruptcy court, or else the \"debtor shall be discharged from [the] debt\"); In re Walker, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1886367\"><a href=\"/opinion/1886367/in-re-walker/\"><span class=\"volume\">195</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">187</span></a></span>, 190 n.3, 195 (Bankr.

See In re Walker, 195 B.R. at 195; Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4007(a) (\"A debtor or any creditor may file a complaint to obtain a determination of the dischargeability of any debt.\"). Thus, bankruptcy courts and nonbankruptcy courts alike are vested with concurrent jurisdiction over nondischargeability proceedings arising under Bankruptcy Code &#167; 523(a)(7). Consequently, at their option, creditors seeking a nondischargeability determination need not submit to the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court, but instead may invoke the jurisdiction of any appropriate nonbankruptcy forum either before or after the bankruptcy proceeding has been closed. See, e.g., In re Walker, 195 B.R. at 203-04; Royal Am. Oil &amp; Gas Co. v.

Thus, the bankruptcy court ruling stands only for the proposition that the reaffirmation effort undertaken by LaRoche did not render the \"shortfall amount\" indebtedness de facto \"nondischargeable.\" See In re Ripple, 242 B.R. at 64 (noting that where reaffirmation agreement meets rigorous &#167; 524 requirements, creditor may recover reaffirmed debt as though debtor never filed bankruptcy petition).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As appellants correctly point out, the bankruptcy court ruling which disallowed the motion to reaffirm filed by LaRoche never purported to resolve the altogether distinct matter relating to the dischargeability of the contingent civil penalty under Bankruptcy Code &#167; 523(a)(7). And since LaRoche commenced no adversary proceeding relating to the dischargeability of the contingent civil penalty, appellants were free to forego their own adversary proceeding. Consequently, their decision not to intervene, notwithstanding the bankruptcy court's invitation, did not forfeit their right to litigate the subsection 523(a)(7) nondischargeability issue at some later date in an appropriate nonbankruptcy forum, viz., the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island, which had retained jurisdiction for the purpose of monitoring the implementation of the CWA/RIWPCA consent decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, at the present juncture this appeal reduces to two principal issues: (i) whether the CWA/RIWPCA consent decree constituted either a binding contractual agreement between the parties or a controlling judicial determination -- in or by a nonbankruptcy forum possessing concurrent jurisdiction -- that the contingent civil penalty imposed upon LaRoche is nondischargeable under Bankruptcy Code &#167; 523(a)(7); and (ii) if not, whether the district court ruling that the civil penalty is dischargeable should be affirmed on other grounds apparent from the record on appeal, see Spenlinhauer v.

See In re Cole, 226 B.R. at 649, 653, 656 (explicitly justifying its holding on ground that \"bankruptcy courts have exclusive jurisdiction to determine the dischargeability of claims arising under &#167; 523(a)(2),\" and refusing to accord collateral estoppel effect to stipulated judgment because state court which entered it clearly lacked jurisdiction to determine underlying facts necessary to resolve &#167; 523(a) issue); In re Mascoll, 246 B.R. at 701, 706 (&#167; 523(a)(2)); In re James, 120 B.R. at 584 (&#167; 523(a)(2)); In re Hirte, 71 B.R. at 250 (noting that claimant's nondischargeability complaint was time-barred by &#167; 523(c)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where an asserted exception to discharge relies upon none of the four waivable exceptions to discharge, however, the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court is concurrent, hence nonexclusive. And since any creditor may opt to litigate, in an appropriate nonbankruptcy forum, its asserted entitlement to an exception from discharge, a debtor's voluntary waiver of objection to such a dischargeability exception in a nonbankruptcy forum would appear to offend no established policy fostered by the Bankruptcy Code.

R. Bankr. 4007(a). Nevertheless, LaRoche did neither, preferring instead to wait six years before complying with his promise to provide the \"expeditious\" and good faith reaffirmation agreement required under the 1991 consent decree.

Consequently, we announce no sweeping rule of law regarding the validity of prepetition waivers of discharge, especially since these matters are almost invariably best assessed on a case-by-case basis. Instead, we conclude that because the district court plainly possessed concurrent jurisdiction over the subsection 523(a)(7) dischargeability issue in 1991, when it approved the consent decree, LaRoche cannot now be heard to contend that the general discharge he was granted in 1995 relieved him of liability for the civil penalty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the district court judgment is vacated and the case is remanded for the entry of judgment for appellants; costs to be borne by appellees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> By negative inference, from Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 4008 (\"A motion by the debtor for approval of a reaffirmation agreement shall be filed before or at the hearing.\"), only the chapter 7 debtor may request bankruptcy court approval of a reaffirmation agreement.
