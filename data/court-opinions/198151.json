SCOTT,\r\n\n                  Plaintiff, Appellant,\r\n\n                            v.\r\n\n           WELLESLEY POLICE DEPARTMENT, ET AL.,\r\n\n                  Defendants, Appellees.\r\n\n       APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n            FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n        [Hon. Nancy Gertner, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                  Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n            Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n               and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n Lorenzo Q. Scott on brief pro se.\r\n Douglas I. Louison, Stephen C. Pfaff, and Merrick and Louisonon brief for appellees.\r\n\nSeptember 24, 1998\r\n\n       Per Curiam.  In connection with a rash of burglaries that\r\nplagued Wellesley, Massachusetts and neighboring communities in\r\n1994 and 1995, plaintiff Lorenzo Scott was convicted in state\r\ncourt of breaking and entering in the nighttime and sentenced\r\nto a lengthy prison term.  In 1996, he filed the instant\r\ndamages action against four officers of the Wellesley Police\r\nDepartment (and the department itself), advancing vague\r\nallegations of Fourth Amendment violations and other\r\nimproprieties surrounding his arrest and conviction.  From a\r\njudgment dismissing most of his claims pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.\r\nP. 12(c) and the remaining ones pursuant to Rule 56, plaintiff\r\nnow appeals.  We affirm. \r\n    Little discussion is required.  Plaintiff's contentions,\r\nas presented on appeal, reduce to the following three claims:\r\nthat defendant Price violated the Fourth Amendment in\r\nconnection with (1) the pre-arrest search of plaintiff's\r\nautomobile, (2) the post-arrest search of his residence, and\r\n(3) the post-arrest search of a pawnshop.  The district court\r\ndisposed of each of these allegations at the summary judgment\r\nstage.  We agree with the court that, to the extent they are\r\nnot barred under Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994),\r\nplaintiff's claims each fail on the merits. \r\n    The challenge to the car search was not properly raised\r\nbelow and so has been waived.  In any event, plaintiff has\r\nfailed to call into question the state court's findings that\r\nprobable cause and exigent circumstances existed.  At a\r\nminimum, he has failed to establish that the search was so\r\nunreasonable that qualified immunity would not apply. \r\nMoreover, while it is undisputed that Price was present at the\r\ntime (along with other officers from Wellesley and elsewhere),\r\nthere is no indication that he participated in the decision to\r\nunlock the car or otherwise assisted in the search. \r\n    The search warrant for plaintiff's residence was obtained\r\non the basis of an affidavit from a Lexington police officer,\r\nto which Price and others had contributed information.  The\r\nshowing of probable cause made therein was easily sufficient to\r\nshield defendants from liability.  See, e.g., Malley v. Briggs,\r\n475 U.S. 335, 344-45 (1986) (\"Only where the warrant\r\napplication is so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to\r\nrender official belief in its existence unreasonable ... will\r\nthe shield of immunity be lost.\").  The charge that Price\r\npurposefully contributed false information to the affidavit\r\nproves unavailing, since it was not advanced in the complaint\r\nand lacks a proper evidentiary foundation in any event.\r\n    Plaintiff's final claim--that the warrantless search of\r\nthe pawnshop was unlawful--likewise fails as a matter of proof. \r\nPlaintiff has not adequately called into question Price's\r\naverment that the pawnshop owner voluntarily turned over the\r\njewelry in question to the Lexington police officers.\r\n    Affirmed.\r\n",
