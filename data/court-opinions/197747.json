Defendant-appellant\r                                                   \r\n\nAlina  Perez,  convicted  of  federal  controlled   substance\r\n\noffenses   and  with  a  record  of  prior  state  controlled\r\n\nsubstance  offenses, was sentenced as a career offender under\r\n\nthe United States Sentencing Guidelines.  She had asked for a\r\n\ndownward departure, and appealed its denial.  We remanded for\r\n\nclarification, and she is now here again, no better off.\r\n\n          Perez's indictment  in the  District Court  for the\r\n\nDistrict of Massachusetts was  on one count of  conspiracy to\r\n\ndistribute   heroin  and  four   counts  of   possession  and\r\n\ndistribution of heroin  in furtherance of the  conspiracy, in\r\n\nviolation  of 21  U.S.C.    846 and  841(a)(1), respectively.\r\n\nShe pled guilty to  the conspiracy charge and  to two of  the\r\n\ndistribution charges,  and nolo  contendre to  the other  two\r                                                      \r\n\ndistribution  charges.  Because of two prior state controlled\r\n\nsubstance  felony  convictions, she  met the  career offender\r\n\ndefinition of  U.S.S.G.    4B1.1 (1995).    Achieving  career\r\n\noffender  status  meant  an initial  total  offense  level of\r\n\nthirty two, an automatic criminal history category of VI, the\r\n\nhighest, and a  guideline sentencing range of  151-188 months\r\n\nafter a three point offense level reduction for acceptance of\r\n\nresponsibility.\r\n\n          At  her  first sentencing  hearing,  Perez  did not\r\n\ndispute the  literal  applicability of  the  career  offender\r\n\nprovision,  but  contended  that she  was  a  \"small player,\"\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\noutside  the heartland of career offender drug cases, because\r\n\nthe amounts of  drugs involved in her offenses,  and her role\r\n\nin  them,  had  been  small.    She  accordingly  requested a\r\n\ndownward departure under   4A1.3,1 but the court refused.  On\r\n\nappeal, we remanded  for clarification of the  court's basis,\r\n\nin  light of United States v.  Lindia, 82 F.3d 1154 (1st Cir.\r                                                 \r\n\n1996), which we had recently decided.   At resentencing Perez\r\n\nagain requested  departure under    4A1.3.   In response  the\r\n\ncourt acknowledged Lindia, but stated that  it was limited to\r                                     \r\n\npermissible considerations, or  \"factors,\" and that smallness\r\n\nof predicates was  an impermissible consideration.   In light\r\n\nof Congressional mandate, whether she was a small player  was\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Adequacy of Criminal History Category (Policy Statement)\r                                                     \r\n\n                          . . . . .\r\n\n          There  may  be  cases   where  the  court\r\n          concludes  that  a  defendant's  criminal\r\n          history   category  significantly   over-\r\n          represents   the    seriousness   of    a\r\n          defendant's  criminal   history  or   the\r\n          likelihood that the defendant will commit\r\n          further crimes.  An example might include\r\n          the case of  a defendant  with two  minor\r\n          misdemeanor  convictions  close   to  ten\r\n          years prior to the instant offense and no\r\n          other evidence of prior criminal behavior\r\n          in the intervening period.  The court may\r\n          conclude  that  the  defendant's criminal\r\n          history  was  significantly  less serious\r\n          than that of most defendants  in the same\r\n          criminal history category  (Category II),\r\n          and   therefore   consider   a   downward\r\n          departure from the guidelines.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\na  \"forbidden factor,\"  beyond consideration  for a  downward\r\n\ndeparture.  We quote.\r\n\n               A   statute,   28   U.S.C.   994(h),\r\n          mandates  that  a  \"career  offender\"  as\r\n          defined in the statute receive a sentence\r\n          at or near  the maximum term  authorized.\r\n          See   4B1.1, Background.   The definition\r                         \r\n          of controlled substance offense specifies\r\n          the  minimum  severity  of  offense  that\r\n          qualifies  as one  of  the two  offenses,\r\n          that,  at minimum,  are needed  to invoke\r\n          the Career Offender provision.  Thus, the\r\n          congressional mandate  does not  speak of\r\n          the  medium-level   controlled  substance\r\n          offense as the  heartland for determining\r\n          whether a  person is  a Career  Offender.\r\n          Instead, the  minimum level  offense that\r\n          is sufficient to qualify  for meeting the\r\n          Career  Offender   test  is   within  the\r\n          heartland, by statutory mandate.\r\n\n          The court added, as to which there is no complaint,\r\n\nthat it would have granted  a departure had it had discretion\r\n\nto do so.  It did, however, once the sentence range  had been\r\n\ncalculated  without that departure, take the lowest permitted\r\n\nas the final figure on the ground of Perez's relatively small\r\n\nrole in the offenses.  We have two questions:  (1)   Whether,\r\n\nif an open  matter, the court's construction was  sound.  (2)\r\n\nWhether,  in light of  Lindia, it was  open.   We answer both\r                                         \r\n\nquestions in the affirmative.\r\n\n          This  court will not  overturn a refusal  to depart\r\n\nfrom  the federal Sentencing Guidelines unless the sentencing\r\n\ncourt abused its discretion.   See Koon v. United States, 116\r                                                                    \r\n\nS.  Ct.  2035,  2043  (1996).   At  the  same  time,  whether\r\n\nconsideration  of a given  factor is impermissible  under any\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\ncircumstances is a question of law, and we need not defer  to\r\n\nthe district court's resolution.\r\n\n          We start with 28 U.S.C.   994(h), that requires the\r\n\nSentencing Commission to \"assure\" that the Guidelines produce\r\n\nsentences for  certain three-time  (\"career\") offenders  that\r\n\nare \"at  or near  the maximum  term authorized\" by  statute.2\r\n\nThe Court,  recognizing Congress's  maximum intent,  has held\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.

The  Commission implemented\r\n\n  994(h) with  Guidelines   4B1.1,3  that computes  sentences\r\n\nfor career  offenders based  on the  identical but  re-termed\r\n\n\"offense  statutory  maximum.\"    In  our  LaBonte  decision,\r                                                              \r\n\nfinding broad discretion in the Commission, we upheld a prior\r\n\nversion  of    4B1.1's  Application  Note   2  that  excluded\r\n\nstatutory  enhancements  from  the words  \"offense  statutory\r\n\nmaximum.\"   Then, between our  decision and its  reversal, we\r\n\nheld, broadly,  in United  States  v. Lindia,  82 F.3d  1154,\r                                                        \r\n\n1164-65 (1st Cir. 1996), that a district court might consider\r\n\na career  offender's criminal history \"unusual,\"  and outside\r\n\nthe \"heartland\" of  career offender cases,  and, if so,  that\r\n\n  4A1.3  allowed downward departure.   We  made no  review or\r\n\nanalysis of the type of criminal history involved, but simply\r\n\nnoted that this  departure turned on whether  career offender\r\n\ntreatment inaccurately reflected  criminal history within the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  U.S.S.G.    4B1.1 provides that  a defendant is  a career\r\noffender if (1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old\r\nat the time  of the instant offense, (2)  the instant offense\r\nof conviction is a felony that is either a crime  of violence\r\nor a controlled  substance offense, and (3) the defendant has\r\nat least  two prior felony  convictions of either a  crime of\r\nviolence or a controlled substance offense.\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nmeaning of 18 U.S.C.   3553(b),4   id. at 1165, viz., whether\r                                                  \r\n\na  career  offender defendant's  particular history  had been\r\n\nadequately  considered by the  Commission in  formulating the\r\n\nGuidelines.\r\n\n          We note, by  way of initial observation,  at least,\r\n\nsomething of  a puzzlement:   in  light of the  Congressional\r\n\nstricture \"at  or near,\"  how to  reconcile Congress's  clear\r\n\npurpose of maximum  sentences for three-time violent  or drug\r\n\noffenders,  id.  at  1164,  with   allowing  adjustments5  or\r                           \r\n\ndownward departures by   4A1.3 which might be sizeable?  Does\r\n\nthat mean  that \"at or  near\" should be broadly  construed to\r\n\npermit substantial reductions when they are applicable?  Does\r\n\nit suggest possible non-recognition of  some type or types of\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  18 U.S.C.   3553(b) provides, in relevant part:\r\n\n          (b) Application of guidelines in imposing\r\n          a sentence. --  The court shall  impose a\r\n          sentence  of  the  kind,  and within  the\r\n          range,  [provided   by  the   guidelines]\r\n          unless the court  finds that there exists\r\n          an aggravating or mitigating circumstance\r\n          of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately\r\n          taken   into    consideration   by    the\r\n          Sentencing Commission in  formulating the\r\n          guidelines  that   should  result   in  a\r\n          sentence different from that described.\r\n\n5.  The  Guidelines  specifically  authorize  application  of\r\n  3E1.1 (acceptance  of responsibility) to  career offenders.\r\nWhether   3B1.2 (mitigating role in instant offense) also may\r\napply is  unsettled.

The word\r\n\n\"certain\" was not defined.\r\n\n          Since adjustments and departures could well achieve\r\n\na  substantial reduction from the maximum authorized term, it\r\n\nis not surprising that  wide variations have developed  as to\r\n\nwhat is perceived to be within \"at or near\" and, accordingly,\r\n\nthe degree  of flexibility  allowed to the  courts.6   In our\r\n\nLaBonte  decision alone the  majority, stating there  must be\r                   \r\n\nsome \"play in the joints,\"  accepted a sentence 61.4% of what\r\n\nit thought the applicable statutory maximum, 70 F.3d at 1409-\r\n\n10,  while  the dissenter  thought  even 72.8%  would  not be\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.

In the  present case  the district\r                         \r\n\ncourt, supra, even while excluding smallness of predicates as\r                        \r\n\na ground for  departure, ended by imposing a  sentence 63% of\r\n\nthe  maximum  authorized  by  giving  Perez  the  benefit  of\r\n\naccepting  responsibility.7   Had  it  been  free  to  depart\r\n\ndownward because of  the smallness of the offenses, the court\r\n\nindicated that  it would  have sentenced Perez  to a  mere 21\r\n\nmonths (9%), within the range applicable without   4B1.1.\r\n\n          This  extended  recital, if  it does  nothing else,\r\n\nreveals  a  picture  that supports  the  conclusion  that the\r\n\nCommission, commanded to \"assure\" that the Guidelines produce\r\n\nnear maximum sentences  for the statutorily  defined category\r\n\nof recidivists, did not  want to leave open  to the courts  a\r\n\ndeparture from the statutory figure  based on the size of the\r\n\noffenses.   We  believe  it  made this  clear  by adopting  a\r\n\nsingle, broad definition of \"felony.\"8  Second,  it adopted a\r\n\nsingle  criminal history category rather than a sliding scale\r\n\nbased  on  the seriousness  of  the past  offenses.   Compare\r                                                                         \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  The  applicable  statutory  maximum  was  20  years  (240\r\nmonths).  Under the Guidelines, Perez's applicable sentencing\r\nrange  initially was  210-262  months.    Crediting  her  for\r\naccepting responsibility brought her applicable range to 151-\r\n188 months.  The court then, within its discretion, chose the\r\nlow end,  151 months, 63%  of 240 months, for  the recognized\r\nsmall role in the offenses.\r\n\n8.  We  note that \"felony\" for   4B1.1 purposes includes both\r\nlarge  and small offenses.  See   4B1.2, Commentary (defining\r                                           \r\nfelony as an \"offense punishable by death or imprisonment for\r\na term exceeding one year.\").\r\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\n  4B1.1 (assigning  criminal history  category VI  to \"every\"\r\n\ncareer  offender \"case\"),  with    4A1.1 and  Ch.  5, pt.  A,\r                                           \r\n\nSentencing Table (determining  criminal history category  for\r\n\nnon-career offenders  by the number  of accumulated  criminal\r\n\nhistory  points).  With such deliberate  uniformity, how is a\r\n\ncourt suddenly  to determine, at  the low end when  all other\r\n\ndegrees  of seriousness  had  been  treated equally,  special\r\n\nterms  for one  group?   And on  what basis?9   For  ordinary\r\n\noffenders, where there  is a sliding  point scale, the  curve\r\n\nmay be thought to continue.  Here there is no curve at all. \r\n\n          Perhaps the  best answer to  defendant's claim lies\r\n\nin  the district court's proffered alternative:  removing her\r\n\nfrom the career offender category entirely.  Thus if downward\r\n\ndeparture   was  possible  based  on  the  smallness  of  the\r\n\noffenses, we would have a  provision -- whose sole purpose is\r\n\nspecial,   substantially  increased   sentences  for   repeat\r\n\noffenders that meet a specific description -- completely read\r\n\nout  of  the  Guidelines  by  a  judicial  finding  that  the\r\n\nCommission  could not really have intended to include what it\r\n\nsaid  it  did.    This  cannot be  the  purpose  of  downward\r\n\ndepartures.   Rather,  we  hold  that  every  offender  whose\r\n\noffenses  meet the  statutory career  offender definition  is\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n9.  To put this in mathematical terms, suppose a  court rates\r\nseriousness of the  offense at 1-20.   On what  basis can  it\r\ndetermine that number  1 was unusual, and that the Commission\r\nhad not thought  of it, and that  if it had thought  it would\r\nnot have applied the even treatment it gave 2-20?\r\n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\nwithin  the intended  heartland, and  departure is  available\r\n\nonly  for  those personally,  and  not  by  the size  of  the\r\n\noffenses,    demonstrating   an    absence   of    recidivist\r\n\ntendencies.10\r\n\n          This conclusion accords with the statutory purpose.\r\n\nTo speak  the  obvious,  the unique  feature  of  the  career\r\n\noffender provision is its focus  on recidivism.  To return to\r\n\nLabonte, 117 S. Ct. at 1677, \"Congress has expressly provided\r                   \r\n\nenhanced maximum penalties  for certain categories of  repeat\r\n\noffenders in an effort to  treat them more harshly than other\r\n\noffenders.\"   Congress itself defined  the felonious  conduct\r\n\nwhose    repetition,     reflecting    habituality     and/or\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n10.  We have no quarrel with  the principle that there may be\r\ndownward departures  because of  individual circumstances  in\r\nliteral  career offender cases  that indicate the  absence of\r\nrecidivism.

When, in another\r\n\ncircumstance, the  Commission took  a lower  maximum, and  we\r\n\napproved it in LaBonte, the  Court reversed.  Here we do  not\r                                  \r\n\nthink that the Commission even intended differentiation to be\r\n\npossible.\r\n\n          It is true  that some courts have, in part, allowed\r\n\nconsideration of the \"minor nature\" of the past offenses, but\r\n\nnone   has   adequately   established   a   connection   with\r\n\nrecidivism.11\r\n\n          There remains the question whether it is open to us\r\n\nto  make this  decision.   Clearly we  are not  foreclosed by\r\n\nKoon,  a non-career  offender case, whose  general discussion\r                \r\n\nrelates  to matters not  fully considered by  the Commission.\r\n\nKoon  does  not  advise  us  as to  what  factors  meet  that\r                \r\n\ndefinition in a career offender  case.  We are more concerned\r\n\nwith our decision in Lindia, 82  F.3d at 1165, where we said,\r                                       \r\n\nspeaking generally,  that  a sentencing  court  might  depart\r\n\ndownward on the basis of a career offender's criminal history\r\n\nif it considered it \"unusual\":\r\n\n          When faced with a  departure motion in  a\r\n          career-offender case, as  in other cases,\r\n          the   court's   experience   and   unique\r\n          perspective will  allow it  to decide  if\r\n          the  case  before  it falls  outside  the\r\n          guideline's    \"heartland,\"    warranting\r\n          departure. \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n11.

In my\r\n\nmind, the  majority opinion misreads the  controlling statute\r\n\nand  the United States Sentencing Guidelines, and is contrary\r\n\nto the  precedent of the  Supreme Court, this court,  and the\r\n\ndecisions  of each  of the  other circuit  courts which  have\r\n\nconsidered  the issue.    Our  holding  in United  States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nLindia, 82 F.3d  1154 (1st Cir. 1996)  directly controls this\r                  \r\n\ncase, as does  the Supreme Court's holding in  Koon v. United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates,  116  S. Ct.  2035  (1996), and  those  cases require\r                  \r\n\nreversal.\r\n\n          The  sole issue to be decided is whether departures\r\n\nunder  U.S.S.G.     4A1.3  are  categorically prohibited  for\r\n\ndefendants classified  as career offenders  under U.S.S.G.   \r\n\n4B1.1 when the defendant's prior criminal record may over- or\r\n\nunderstate the seriousness  of the offenses and  the district\r\n\ncourt could find that this defendant was not in the heartland\r\n\nof career  offenders.13   The district  court concluded  that\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n13.  The  career  offender provisions  are  triggered by  two\r\nprior convictions.  The quantities of drugs and Alina Perez's\r\nrole in  the prior offenses  are documented in the  record of\r\nthe district court.   Ms. Perez, a heroin  addict, sold drugs\r\nfor $60  to an  undercover police officer  in 1987,  and pled\r\nguilty to  distribution of  heroin and cocaine  in 1988.   In\r\n1991, Ms. Perez was arrested for distribution of cocaine.\r\n   In fairness  to the government,  it should  be noted  that\r\nthere were three other state court drug convictions which the\r\ndefendant successfully vacated before her federal sentencing.\r\nIn addition, after  her federal sentence, she  pled guilty to\r\nanother state cocaine distribution charge and received a five\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nsuch a categorical  prohibition deprived it of  discretion to\r\n\nconsider whether Perez's criminal history category overstated\r\n\nthe seriousness  of her  prior crimes  and therefore  whether\r\n\nPerez could receive a downward departure.  The district court\r\n\ndecided that it  had no discretion to depart,  but said that,\r\n\nif it  were  permitted,  it would  have  granted  a  downward\r\n\ndeparture.14  On this question of law, the district court was\r\n\nin  error;  it  was not  forbidden  from  considering whether\r\n\ndefendant's  offenses  fall  within  the  heartland  or  were\r\n\natypical.\r\n\n          Offenders, such  as defendant Perez,  who have  two\r\n\nprior felony  convictions for  controlled substance  offenses\r\n\nare automatically placed in criminal history category VI (the\r\n\nhighest criminal  history category)  and assigned  an offense\r\n\nlevel  determined by  the \"offense  statutory maximum\"  under\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nyear sentence concurrent with her federal sentence.\r\n   In this federal offense, Perez was arrested for possession\r\nof 13.641  grams of heroin.   Without the application  of the\r\ncareer  offender guidelines, her  sentencing range would have\r\nbeen 18 to 24 months.  Because she was a career offender, her\r\nsentencing range jumped to 151 to 188 months.\r\n\n14.  It is settled law that  great deference is accorded to a\r\ndistrict court's determination  that a case falls  outside of\r\nthe heartland.   When,  as in this  case, the  district court\r\ndecides  that  a case  is  so  unusual  that a  departure  is\r\nwarranted, deference is  owed to its \"special  competence\" in\r\ndeciding  whether the  case before  it is  a heartland  case.\r\nSee, e.g.,  Koon, 116 S. Ct.  at 2046-47; Lindia, 82  F.3d at\r                                                            \r\n1165; United States v. Rodriguez-Cardona, 924 F.2d 1148, 1157\r                                                    \r\n(1st  Cir. 1991).   The  majority's  concerns about  \"special\r\ntreatment  for one  group\" are  misplaced.   Every  departure\r\nraises the same difficult issue of separating an unusual case\r\nfrom ordinary cases.\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nU.S.S.G.   4B1.1.  The Guidelines sentencing table mandates a\r\n\nsentencing range (in  this case 151 to 188  months) where the\r\n\ndefendant's  criminal  history  category  and  offense  level\r\n\nintersect.  Section 4A1.3 allows  a sentencing court to grant\r\n\na  departure  from  the  sentencing  range  mandated  by  the\r\n\nGuidelines  when  the  \"defendant's   criminal  history  [is]\r\n\nsignificantly  less serious than  that of most  defendants in\r\n\nthe same criminal history category . . . .\"\r\n\n          The  majority  concludes  that  departures under   \r\n\n4A1.3  based   on   an  offender's   criminal   history   are\r\n\ncategorically   forbidden  for   career   offenders.     This\r\n\nconclusion derives  from  the  majority's  misreading  of  28\r\n\nU.S.C.   994(h).  The  majority's conclusion depends upon its\r\n\nassertion that   994(h) requires the Sentencing Commission to\r\n\n\"produce\" sentences for three-time  (\"career\") offenders that\r\n\nare \"at  or  near the  maximum term  authorized\" by  statute.\r\n\nThat  assertion is  not correct.   What the  statute actually\r\n\nsays is:  \"The Commission  shall assure  that the  guidelines\r                                                                         \r\n\nspecify a sentence  to a term of imprisonment at  or near the\r                   \r\n\nmaximum  term authorized for [career offenders].\" 28 U.S.C.  \r\n\n994(h) (emphasis added).\r\n\n          The Guidelines do indeed  specify such sentences at\r\n\nor near the maximum for career offenders in U.S.S.G.   4B1.1.\r\n\nBut  nothing in    994(h)  requires that  every  offender who\r                                                           \r\n\nfalls under  the Guidelines provisions  for career  offenders\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nreceive the maximum  sentence.  The Guidelines  were designed\r\n\nto  allow for departures when appropriate, and departures are\r\n\npermissible  in exceptional  cases.  See  Lindia, 82  F.3d at\r                                                            \r\n\n1165   (\"Section  994(h),   however,   is  directed   to  the\r\n\nCommission's  duty  to  formulate  guidelines  pertaining  to\r\n\ncategories of defendants, not to sentencing courts faced with\r\n\nindividual  defendants.\"); United  States v.  Novey, 78  F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\n1483, 1489 (10th Cir. 1996) (\"Section 994(h) does not mandate\r\n\nthat each individual defendant receive a sentence 'at or near\r\n\nthe  maximum term authorized.'   Rather, the  statute directs\r\n\nthe Commission to  assure that the guidelines  specify such a\r\n\nterm for 'categories of defendants' in which the defendant is\r\n\na recidivist violent felon or drug offender.\").\r\n\n          Because  of the misreading  by the majority,  it is\r\n\nimportant  to  clarify  the  proper  method  for  determining\r\n\nwhether  a departure  is warranted  under  U.S.S.G.    4A1.3.\r\n\nSection  4A1.3  is   concerned  with  the  accuracy   of  the\r\n\ndefendant's  criminal history  category.   Under  U.S.S.G.   \r\n\n4A1.3,  the point of reference for departures is a comparison\r\n\nwith  the other offenders in the defendant's criminal history\r\n\ncategory.   The proper departure  inquiry in this case  is to\r\n\ncompare  the  defendant  to   the  \"typical\"  or  \"heartland\"\r\n\ncriminal history category VI offender.  As   4A1.3 says:\r\n\n        There may be cases where the  court concludes\r\n        that a defendant's  criminal history category\r\n        significantly over-represents the seriousness\r\n        of  a  defendant's  criminal  history or  the\r                                                            \r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\n        likelihood  that  the defendant  will  commit\r\n        further  crimes.  . .  .      The  court  may\r\n        conclude   that   the   defendant's  criminal\r                                                                 \r\n        history was  significantly less  serious than\r                                                                 \r\n        that of most defendants in the  same criminal\r                                                                 \r\n        history category . . . and therefore consider\r                                    \r\n        a downward departure from the guidelines.\r\n\nU.S.S.G.   4A1.3 (emphasis added)\r\n\n          The  question is  not whether  the  previous offenses\r\n\nwere \"small\" but  rather whether the offender's  criminal history\r\n\nis  so \"significantly  less serious\"  than that of  the heartland\r\n\ncriminal  history category  VI offender  (not  just other  career\r\n\noffenders) that a  departure is warranted.  Cf.  United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nReyes, 8  F.3d 1379, 1384  (9th Cir. 1993) (proper  comparison is\r               \r\n\nwith other offenders).\r\n\n          In  addition  to  its misreading  of  the controlling\r\n\nstatute, the  majority ignores the  plain language of  U.S.S.G.  \r\n\n4A1.3.  Section  4A1.3 repeatedly states that a  departure may be\r\n\ngranted  if \"the criminal  history category does  not reflect the\r\n\nseriousness  of  the  defendant's past  criminal  conduct  or the\r                                                                       \r\n\nlikelihood  that   the  defendant  will   commit  other  crimes.\"\r\n\n(emphasis added).   The Guideline's use of the  word \"or\" instead\r\n\nof \"and\" is telling.  Under   4A1.3, a defendant's \"past criminal\r\n\nconduct\" may alone justify a departure, apart from his likelihood\r                            \r\n\nof  recidivism.    The  majority's  attempt  to  distinguish  the\r\n\noverwhelming  precedent contrary to  its decision on  the grounds\r\n\nthat these  other  cases  did not  establish  a  connection  with\r\n\nrecidivism is  contrary to the plain meaning of    4A1.3.  In any\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\nevent, an offender's  criminal past is an excellent  (perhaps the\r\n\nbest) predictor of his likelihood of recidivism.\r\n\n          Nor does the majority consider that upward departures\r\n\nfrom criminal  history category VI  are explicitly endorsed  by  \r\n\n4A1.3, based on  \"the nature of the prior offenses.\"   This court\r\n\nhas  routinely  approved  such   upward  departures  for   repeat\r\n\noffenders  based on  their prior  bad  acts.   See, e.g.,  United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Black, 78 F.3d 1,  8 (1st Cir. 1996); United States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nParkinson, 44 F.3d  6, 10 (1st  Cir. 1994).   Under the  majority\r                   \r\n\nopinion,    4A1.3 becomes a one-way rachet; upward departures may\r\n\nbe granted based on prior  offenses, but not downward departures.\r\n\nThe plain language  of   4A1.3 demonstrates that,  except for the\r\n\nspecific exception of criminal history category I offenders, both\r\n\nupward  and  downward  departures   are  contemplated.    Neither\r\n\nCongress nor the  Sentencing Commission intended  such a lack  of\r\n\neven-handedness.\r\n\n          In addition to misreading the controlling statute and\r\n\nthe language of  the Guidelines, the majority  also misinterprets\r\n\ncontrolling precedent.  The majority incorrectly implies that the\r\n\nSupreme Court's recent decision in  United States v. LaBonte, 117\r                                                                      \r\n\nS.  Ct.  1673 (1997)  undercuts  our  holding  in Lindia  that  a\r                                                                  \r\n\nsentencing court may grant a career offender a downward departure\r\n\nif  the  court  concludes  that  the  guideline  career  offender\r\n\ncriminal history category  inaccurately reflects the  defendant's\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\ncriminal history.  LaBonte has little bearing on the issue to  be\r                                    \r\n\ndecided in this case.\r\n\n          LaBonte  addresses  the  offense  level  axis of  the\r                             \r\n\nsentencing table,  not the criminal  history category axis.   The\r\n\nissue in LaBonte was not departures but the meaning of the phrase\r                          \r\n\n\"offense  statutory  maximum\"  for   purposes  of  computing   an\r\n\noffender's  offense  level.    The  Court  was  asked  to  decide\r\n\n\"whether,  by 'maximum term  authorized,' Congress meant  (1) the\r\n\nmaximum  term available for  the offense of  conviction including\r\n\nany  applicable statutory sentencing  enhancements, . .  . or (2)\r\n\nthe maximum  term available  without such enhancements  . .  . .\"\r\n\nLaBonte, 117 S.

Koon  explained that  \"a  federal court's\r                                      \r\n\nexamination of whether a factor  can ever be an appropriate basis\r\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\nfor  departure is limited  to determining whether  the Commission\r\n\nhas proscribed,  as a  categorical matter,  consideration of  the\r\n\nfactor.  If the answer to the question is no . . . the sentencing\r\n\ncourt  must determine  whether the  factor, as  occurring in  the\r\n\nparticular circumstances, takes the case outside the heartland of\r\n\nthe applicable Guideline.\"  Koon, 116 S.

Thus if a\r                                          \r\n\nfactor  is  not expressly  forbidden,  it  may  at least  in  the\r\n\nexceptional  case serve  as  the  basis for  a  departure.   Koon\r                                                                           \r\n\nexplicitly  states  that \"for  the  courts to  conclude  a factor\r\n\n[other than an explicitly forbidden factor such as race] must not\r\n\nbe considered under any circumstances  would be to transgress the\r\n\npolicymaking authority vested in the Commission.\"  Id. at 2050.\r                                                                \r\n\n          In Koon the Supreme Court  expressly held that only a\r                             \r\n\nfew  reasons  for  departure are  entirely  prohibited  under the\r\n\nGuidelines, as the Guidelines do  not limit the kinds of factors,\r\n\nwhether  or not mentioned  anywhere else in  the Guidelines, that\r\n\ncould constitute grounds  for departure in an unusual  case.  The\r\n\nonly  departure factors entirely forbidden by the Guidelines are:\r\n\nrace, sex,  national origin,  creed,  religion and  socioeconomic\r\n\nstatus, see  U.S.S.G.   5H1.10, lack of  guidance as a youth, see\r                                                                           \r\n\nU.S.S.G.    5H1.12,  drug or alcohol  dependence, see  U.S.S.G.  \r                                                               \r\n\n5H1.4,  and  economic  duress,  see      5K2.12.

See Collins,  122 F.3d at  1304 (\"Because  section 4A1.3\r                              \r\n\n                             -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n\nprovides an encouraged basis for departure not already taken into\r\n\naccount by the  Commission, over-representation of a  defendant's\r\n\ncriminal history  or likelihood for recidivism always  will be an\r\n\napproved ground for departure.\"); Lindia, 82 F.3d at 1165.\r                                                  \r\n\n          The majority  holds  that,  because  the  defendant's\r\n\nprior drug felonies are the reason she is categorized as a career\r\n\noffender,  her prior crimes  were already \"adequately  taken into\r\n\naccount  by   the  Sentencing   Commission  in   formulating  the\r\n\nguidelines,\" U.S.S.G.   5K2.0,  and could not therefore  serve as\r\n\nthe basis of a departure.   Koon explicitly addressed this issue,\r                                          \r\n\nand decided  that if a  Guideline already takes a  certain factor\r\n\ninto account, then the factor  must be present to an \"exceptional\r\n\ndegree\" before a departure may be granted.  But Koon, contrary to\r                                                              \r\n\nthe reasoning  employed by  the majority, did  not rule  out such\r\n\ndepartures entirely.   Under Koon, if an encouraged factor (e.g.,\r                                           \r\n\ncriminal history under   4A1.3)  is already taken into account by\r\n\na  Guideline  (as  is criminal  history  in  the  career offender\r\n\nguideline),  \"the  court  should depart  only  if  the factor  is\r\n\npresent to an  exceptional degree or in some other  way makes the\r\n\ncase  different  from  the  ordinary case  where  the  factor  is\r\n\npresent.\"  Koon, 116 S. Ct. at 2045.  See also Lindia, 82 F.3d at\r                                                               \r\n\n1164-65; United States v.

Under Koon, the majority's holding that  departures under\r                            \r\n\n 4A1.3 for  career offenders  are precluded  by  implication is\r\n\n                             -24-\r                                          24\r\r\n\nincorrect.   Departures for career offenders under   4A1.3 should\r\n\nbe extremely rare, but it is wrong to forbid them entirely.\r\n\n          Koon's   holding   that  only   expressly   forbidden\r                          \r\n\ndeparture factors  may never serve  as the basis for  a departure\r\n\nhas been, until today, regularly followed by this court, and thus\r\n\nthe  majority's  position  is  in  conflict  with  other  of  our\r\n\nprecedent.  See, e.g., United States v. Brewster, 127 F.3d 22, 26\r                                                          \r\n\n(1st Cir.  1997) (noting that  it is a \"fundamental  principle of\r\n\ndeparture  jurisprudence: that,  in the  absence  of an  explicit\r\n\nproscription,  courts generally  should not  reject categorically\r\n\nany factor as a potential departure predicate\"); United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nClase-Espinal, 115 F.3d 1054, 1060 (1st Cir. 1997) (noting Koon's\r                                                                         \r\n\ninstruction that \"with few  exceptions, departure factors  should\r\n\nnot  be ruled  out on  a  categorical basis\");  United States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nHardy,  99 F.3d  1242,  1249  (1st Cir.  1996)  (stating that  \"a\r               \r\n\ndeparture  criterion  cannot  be  deemed   impermissible  in  all\r\n\ncircumstances    unless   categorically    foreclosed   by    the\r\n\nCommission\").

In  contrast to\r                        \r\n\nvocational   skills,   departures   under      4A1.3      for  an\r\n\noverrepresentative  criminal  history category  are  specifically\r\n\nencouraged under  the Guidelines.

We remanded for\r\n\nclarification, and she is now here again, no better off.\r\n\n          Perez's indictment  in the  District Court  for the\r\n\nDistrict of Massachusetts was  on one count of  conspiracy to\r\n\ndistribute   heroin  and  four   counts  of   possession  and\r\n\ndistribution of heroin  in furtherance of the  conspiracy, in\r\n\nviolation  of 21  U.S.C.    846 and  841(a)(1), respectively.\r\n\nShe pled guilty to  the conspiracy charge and  to two of  the\r\n\ndistribution charges,  and nolo  contendre to  the other  two\r                                                      \r\n\ndistribution  charges.  Because of two prior state controlled\r\n\nsubstance  felony  convictions, she  met the  career offender\r\n\ndefinition of  U.S.S.G.    4B1.1 (1995).    Achieving  career\r\n\noffender  status  meant  an initial  total  offense  level of\r\n\nthirty two, an automatic criminal history category of VI, the\r\n\nhighest, and a  guideline sentencing range of  151-188 months\r\n\nafter a three point offense level reduction for acceptance of\r\n\nresponsibility.\r\n\n          At  her  first sentencing  hearing,  Perez  did not\r\n\ndispute the  literal  applicability of  the  career  offender\r\n\nprovision,  but  contended  that she  was  a  \"small player,\"\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\noutside  the heartland of career offender drug cases, because\r\n\nthe amounts of  drugs involved in her offenses,  and her role\r\n\nin  them,  had  been  small.    She  accordingly  requested a\r\n\ndownward departure under   4A1.3,1 but the court refused.  On\r\n\nappeal, we remanded  for clarification of the  court's basis,\r\n\nin  light of United States v.  Lindia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196710\"><a href=\"/opinion/196710/united-states-v-lindia/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1154</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir.\r                                                 \r\n\n1996), which we had recently decided.   At resentencing Perez\r\n\nagain requested  departure under    4A1.3.   In response  the\r\n\ncourt acknowledged Lindia, but stated that  it was limited to\r                                     \r\n\npermissible considerations, or  \"factors,\" and that smallness\r\n\nof predicates was  an impermissible consideration.

Adequacy of Criminal History Category (Policy Statement)\r                                                     \r\n\n                          . . . . .\r\n\n          There  may  be  cases   where  the  court\r\n          concludes  that  a  defendant's  criminal\r\n          history   category  significantly   over-\r\n          represents   the    seriousness   of    a\r\n          defendant's  criminal   history  or   the\r\n          likelihood that the defendant will commit\r\n          further crimes.  An example might include\r\n          the case of  a defendant  with two  minor\r\n          misdemeanor  convictions  close   to  ten\r\n          years prior to the instant offense and no\r\n          other evidence of prior criminal behavior\r\n          in the intervening period.  The court may\r\n          conclude  that  the  defendant's criminal\r\n          history  was  significantly  less serious\r\n          than that of most defendants  in the same\r\n          criminal history category  (Category II),\r\n          and   therefore   consider   a   downward\r\n          departure from the guidelines.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\na  \"forbidden factor,\"  beyond consideration  for a  downward\r\n\ndeparture.  We quote.\r\n\n               A   statute,   28   U.S.C.   994(h),\r\n          mandates  that  a  \"career  offender\"  as\r\n          defined in the statute receive a sentence\r\n          at or near  the maximum term  authorized.\r\n          See   4B1.1, Background.   The definition\r                         \r\n          of controlled substance offense specifies\r\n          the  minimum  severity  of  offense  that\r\n          qualifies  as one  of  the two  offenses,\r\n          that,  at minimum,  are needed  to invoke\r\n          the Career Offender provision.  Thus, the\r\n          congressional mandate  does not  speak of\r\n          the  medium-level   controlled  substance\r\n          offense as the  heartland for determining\r\n          whether a  person is  a Career  Offender.\r\n          Instead, the  minimum level  offense that\r\n          is sufficient to qualify  for meeting the\r\n          Career  Offender   test  is   within  the\r\n          heartland, by statutory mandate.\r\n\n          The court added, as to which there is no complaint,\r\n\nthat it would have granted  a departure had it had discretion\r\n\nto do so.  It did, however, once the sentence range  had been\r\n\ncalculated  without that departure, take the lowest permitted\r\n\nas the final figure on the ground of Perez's relatively small\r\n\nrole in the offenses.  We have two questions:  (1)   Whether,\r\n\nif an open  matter, the court's construction was  sound.  (2)\r\n\nWhether,  in light of  Lindia, it was  open.   We answer both\r                                         \r\n\nquestions in the affirmative.\r\n\n          This  court will not  overturn a refusal  to depart\r\n\nfrom  the federal Sentencing Guidelines unless the sentencing\r\n\ncourt abused its discretion.   See Koon v. United States, 116\r                                                                    \r\n\nS.  Ct.  2035,  2043  (1996).   At  the  same  time,  whether\r\n\nconsideration  of a given  factor is impermissible  under any\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\ncircumstances is a question of law, and we need not defer  to\r\n\nthe district court's resolution.\r\n\n          We start with 28 U.S.C.   994(h), that requires the\r\n\nSentencing Commission to \"assure\" that the Guidelines produce\r\n\nsentences for  certain three-time  (\"career\") offenders  that\r\n\nare \"at  or near  the maximum  term authorized\" by  statute.2\r\n\nThe Court,  recognizing Congress's  maximum intent,  has held\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.

In the  present case  the district\r                         \r\n\ncourt, supra, even while excluding smallness of predicates as\r                        \r\n\na ground for  departure, ended by imposing a  sentence 63% of\r\n\nthe  maximum  authorized  by  giving  Perez  the  benefit  of\r\n\naccepting  responsibility.7   Had  it  been  free  to  depart\r\n\ndownward because of  the smallness of the offenses, the court\r\n\nindicated that  it would  have sentenced Perez  to a  mere 21\r\n\nmonths (9%), within the range applicable without   4B1.1.\r\n\n          This  extended  recital, if  it does  nothing else,\r\n\nreveals  a  picture  that supports  the  conclusion  that the\r\n\nCommission, commanded to \"assure\" that the Guidelines produce\r\n\nnear maximum sentences  for the statutorily  defined category\r\n\nof recidivists, did not  want to leave open  to the courts  a\r\n\ndeparture from the statutory figure  based on the size of the\r\n\noffenses.   We  believe  it  made this  clear  by adopting  a\r\n\nsingle, broad definition of \"felony.\"8  Second,  it adopted a\r\n\nsingle  criminal history category rather than a sliding scale\r\n\nbased  on  the seriousness  of  the past  offenses.   Compare\r                                                                         \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  The  applicable  statutory  maximum  was  20  years  (240\r\nmonths).  Under the Guidelines, Perez's applicable sentencing\r\nrange  initially was  210-262  months.    Crediting  her  for\r\naccepting responsibility brought her applicable range to 151-\r\n188 months.  The court then, within its discretion, chose the\r\nlow end,  151 months, 63%  of 240 months, for  the recognized\r\nsmall role in the offenses.\r\n\n8.  We  note that \"felony\" for   4B1.1 purposes includes both\r\nlarge  and small offenses.  See   4B1.2, Commentary (defining\r                                           \r\nfelony as an \"offense punishable by death or imprisonment for\r\na term exceeding one year.\").\r\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\n  4B1.1 (assigning  criminal history  category VI  to \"every\"\r\n\ncareer  offender \"case\"),  with    4A1.1 and  Ch.  5, pt.  A,\r                                           \r\n\nSentencing Table (determining  criminal history category  for\r\n\nnon-career offenders  by the number  of accumulated  criminal\r\n\nhistory  points).  With such deliberate  uniformity, how is a\r\n\ncourt suddenly  to determine, at  the low end when  all other\r\n\ndegrees  of seriousness  had  been  treated equally,  special\r\n\nterms  for one  group?   And on  what basis?9   For  ordinary\r\n\noffenders, where there  is a sliding  point scale, the  curve\r\n\nmay be thought to continue.  Here there is no curve at all. \r\n\n          Perhaps the  best answer to  defendant's claim lies\r\n\nin  the district court's proffered alternative:  removing her\r\n\nfrom the career offender category entirely.  Thus if downward\r\n\ndeparture   was  possible  based  on  the  smallness  of  the\r\n\noffenses, we would have a  provision -- whose sole purpose is\r\n\nspecial,   substantially  increased   sentences  for   repeat\r\n\noffenders that meet a specific description -- completely read\r\n\nout  of  the  Guidelines  by  a  judicial  finding  that  the\r\n\nCommission  could not really have intended to include what it\r\n\nsaid  it  did.    This  cannot be  the  purpose  of  downward\r\n\ndepartures.   Rather,  we  hold  that  every  offender  whose\r\n\noffenses  meet the  statutory career  offender definition  is\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n9.  To put this in mathematical terms, suppose a  court rates\r\nseriousness of the  offense at 1-20.   On what  basis can  it\r\ndetermine that number  1 was unusual, and that the Commission\r\nhad not thought  of it, and that  if it had thought  it would\r\nnot have applied the even treatment it gave 2-20?\r\n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\nwithin  the intended  heartland, and  departure is  available\r\n\nonly  for  those personally,  and  not  by  the size  of  the\r\n\noffenses,    demonstrating   an    absence   of    recidivist\r\n\ntendencies.10\r\n\n          This conclusion accords with the statutory purpose.\r\n\nTo speak  the  obvious,  the unique  feature  of  the  career\r\n\noffender provision is its focus  on recidivism.  To return to\r\n\nLabonte, 117 S. Ct. at 1677, \"Congress has expressly provided\r                   \r\n\nenhanced maximum penalties  for certain categories of  repeat\r\n\noffenders in an effort to  treat them more harshly than other\r\n\noffenders.\"   Congress itself defined  the felonious  conduct\r\n\nwhose    repetition,     reflecting    habituality     and/or\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n10.  We have no quarrel with  the principle that there may be\r\ndownward departures  because of  individual circumstances  in\r\nliteral  career offender cases  that indicate the  absence of\r\nrecidivism.

When, in another\r\n\ncircumstance, the  Commission took  a lower  maximum, and  we\r\n\napproved it in LaBonte, the  Court reversed.

The  career  offender provisions  are  triggered by  two\r\nprior convictions.  The quantities of drugs and Alina Perez's\r\nrole in  the prior offenses  are documented in the  record of\r\nthe district court.   Ms. Perez, a heroin  addict, sold drugs\r\nfor $60  to an  undercover police officer  in 1987,  and pled\r\nguilty to  distribution of  heroin and cocaine  in 1988.   In\r\n1991, Ms. Perez was arrested for distribution of cocaine.\r\n   In fairness  to the government,  it should  be noted  that\r\nthere were three other state court drug convictions which the\r\ndefendant successfully vacated before her federal sentencing.\r\nIn addition, after  her federal sentence, she  pled guilty to\r\nanother state cocaine distribution charge and received a five\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nsuch a categorical  prohibition deprived it of  discretion to\r\n\nconsider whether Perez's criminal history category overstated\r\n\nthe seriousness  of her  prior crimes  and therefore  whether\r\n\nPerez could receive a downward departure.  The district court\r\n\ndecided that it  had no discretion to depart,  but said that,\r\n\nif it  were  permitted,  it would  have  granted  a  downward\r\n\ndeparture.14  On this question of law, the district court was\r\n\nin  error;  it  was not  forbidden  from  considering whether\r\n\ndefendant's  offenses  fall  within  the  heartland  or  were\r\n\natypical.\r\n\n          Offenders, such  as defendant Perez,  who have  two\r\n\nprior felony  convictions for  controlled substance  offenses\r\n\nare automatically placed in criminal history category VI (the\r\n\nhighest criminal  history category)  and assigned  an offense\r\n\nlevel  determined by  the \"offense  statutory maximum\"  under\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nyear sentence concurrent with her federal sentence.\r\n   In this federal offense, Perez was arrested for possession\r\nof 13.641  grams of heroin.   Without the application  of the\r\ncareer  offender guidelines, her  sentencing range would have\r\nbeen 18 to 24 months.  Because she was a career offender, her\r\nsentencing range jumped to 151 to 188 months.\r\n\n14.  It is settled law that  great deference is accorded to a\r\ndistrict court's determination  that a case falls  outside of\r\nthe heartland.   When,  as in this  case, the  district court\r\ndecides  that  a case  is  so  unusual  that a  departure  is\r\nwarranted, deference is  owed to its \"special  competence\" in\r\ndeciding  whether the  case before  it is  a heartland  case.\r\nSee, e.g.,  Koon, 116 S. Ct.  at 2046-47; Lindia, 82  F.3d at\r                                                            \r\n1165; United States v.

The  majority's  concerns about  \"special\r\ntreatment  for one  group\" are  misplaced.   Every  departure\r\nraises the same difficult issue of separating an unusual case\r\nfrom ordinary cases.\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nU.S.S.G.   4B1.1.  The Guidelines sentencing table mandates a\r\n\nsentencing range (in  this case 151 to 188  months) where the\r\n\ndefendant's  criminal  history  category  and  offense  level\r\n\nintersect.  Section 4A1.3 allows  a sentencing court to grant\r\n\na  departure  from  the  sentencing  range  mandated  by  the\r\n\nGuidelines  when  the  \"defendant's   criminal  history  [is]\r\n\nsignificantly  less serious than  that of most  defendants in\r\n\nthe same criminal history category . . . .\"\r\n\n          The  majority  concludes  that  departures under   \r\n\n4A1.3  based   on   an  offender's   criminal   history   are\r\n\ncategorically   forbidden  for   career   offenders.     This\r\n\nconclusion derives  from  the  majority's  misreading  of  28\r\n\nU.S.C.   994(h).  The  majority's conclusion depends upon its\r\n\nassertion that   994(h) requires the Sentencing Commission to\r\n\n\"produce\" sentences for three-time  (\"career\") offenders that\r\n\nare \"at  or  near the  maximum term  authorized\" by  statute.\r\n\nThat  assertion is  not correct.   What the  statute actually\r\n\nsays is:  \"The Commission  shall assure  that the  guidelines\r                                                                         \r\n\nspecify a sentence  to a term of imprisonment at  or near the\r                   \r\n\nmaximum  term authorized for [career offenders].\" 28 U.S.C.  \r\n\n994(h) (emphasis added).\r\n\n          The Guidelines do indeed  specify such sentences at\r\n\nor near the maximum for career offenders in U.S.S.G.   4B1.1.\r\n\nBut  nothing in    994(h)  requires that  every  offender who\r                                                           \r\n\nfalls under  the Guidelines provisions  for career  offenders\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nreceive the maximum  sentence.  The Guidelines  were designed\r\n\nto  allow for departures when appropriate, and departures are\r\n\npermissible  in exceptional  cases.

Under  U.S.S.G.   \r\n\n4A1.3,  the point of reference for departures is a comparison\r\n\nwith  the other offenders in the defendant's criminal history\r\n\ncategory.   The proper departure  inquiry in this case  is to\r\n\ncompare  the  defendant  to   the  \"typical\"  or  \"heartland\"\r\n\ncriminal history category VI offender.  As   4A1.3 says:\r\n\n        There may be cases where the  court concludes\r\n        that a defendant's  criminal history category\r\n        significantly over-represents the seriousness\r\n        of  a  defendant's  criminal  history or  the\r                                                            \r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\n        likelihood  that  the defendant  will  commit\r\n        further  crimes.  . .  .      The  court  may\r\n        conclude   that   the   defendant's  criminal\r                                                                 \r\n        history was  significantly less  serious than\r                                                                 \r\n        that of most defendants in the  same criminal\r                                                                 \r\n        history category . . . and therefore consider\r                                    \r\n        a downward departure from the guidelines.\r\n\nU.S.S.G.   4A1.3 (emphasis added)\r\n\n          The  question is  not whether  the  previous offenses\r\n\nwere \"small\" but  rather whether the offender's  criminal history\r\n\nis  so \"significantly  less serious\"  than that of  the heartland\r\n\ncriminal  history category  VI offender  (not  just other  career\r\n\noffenders) that a  departure is warranted.  Cf.  United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nReyes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"656624\"><a href=\"/opinion/656624/united-states-of-america-cross-appellee-v-armando-reyes/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1379</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1384  (9th Cir. 1993) (proper  comparison is\r               \r\n\nwith other offenders).\r\n\n          In  addition  to  its misreading  of  the controlling\r\n\nstatute, the  majority ignores the  plain language of  U.S.S.G.  \r\n\n4A1.3.  Section  4A1.3 repeatedly states that a  departure may be\r\n\ngranted  if \"the criminal  history category does  not reflect the\r\n\nseriousness  of  the  defendant's past  criminal  conduct  or the\r                                                                       \r\n\nlikelihood  that   the  defendant  will   commit  other  crimes.\"\r\n\n(emphasis added).   The Guideline's use of the  word \"or\" instead\r\n\nof \"and\" is telling.  Under   4A1.3, a defendant's \"past criminal\r\n\nconduct\" may alone justify a departure, apart from his likelihood\r                            \r\n\nof  recidivism.    The  majority's  attempt  to  distinguish  the\r\n\noverwhelming  precedent contrary to  its decision on  the grounds\r\n\nthat these  other  cases  did not  establish  a  connection  with\r\n\nrecidivism is  contrary to the plain meaning of    4A1.3.  In any\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\nevent, an offender's  criminal past is an excellent  (perhaps the\r\n\nbest) predictor of his likelihood of recidivism.\r\n\n          Nor does the majority consider that upward departures\r\n\nfrom criminal  history category VI  are explicitly endorsed  by  \r\n\n4A1.3, based on  \"the nature of the prior offenses.\"   This court\r\n\nhas  routinely  approved  such   upward  departures  for   repeat\r\n\noffenders  based on  their prior  bad  acts.   See, e.g.,  United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.

Under the  majority\r                   \r\n\nopinion,    4A1.3 becomes a one-way rachet; upward departures may\r\n\nbe granted based on prior  offenses, but not downward departures.\r\n\nThe plain language  of   4A1.3 demonstrates that,  except for the\r\n\nspecific exception of criminal history category I offenders, both\r\n\nupward  and  downward  departures   are  contemplated.    Neither\r\n\nCongress nor the  Sentencing Commission intended  such a lack  of\r\n\neven-handedness.\r\n\n          In addition to misreading the controlling statute and\r\n\nthe language of  the Guidelines, the majority  also misinterprets\r\n\ncontrolling precedent.  The majority incorrectly implies that the\r\n\nSupreme Court's recent decision in  United States v. LaBonte, 117\r                                                                      \r\n\nS.

LaBonte has little bearing on the issue to  be\r                                    \r\n\ndecided in this case.\r\n\n          LaBonte  addresses  the  offense  level  axis of  the\r                             \r\n\nsentencing table,  not the criminal  history category axis.

Koon explicitly addressed this issue,\r                                          \r\n\nand decided  that if a  Guideline already takes a  certain factor\r\n\ninto account, then the factor  must be present to an \"exceptional\r\n\ndegree\" before a departure may be granted.

The suggested distinction  between \"personal\"\r\n\nversus  \"offense\" criminal  history is  a  distinction without  a\r\n\ndifference.   An offender's criminal history category is computed\r\n\nbased  on that person's  prior criminal acts,  i.e., the offenses\r\n\nthe  person  committed.   The  offenses  in which  the  defendant\r\n\nparticipated define an offender's criminal history.\r                             \r\n\n          Our  role is  limited to  deciding an  issue of  law:\r\n\nwhether a  departure based on  the character  of the  defendant's\r\n\nprior  offenses is  ever permissible  for career  offenders.
