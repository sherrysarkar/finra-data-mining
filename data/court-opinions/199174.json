In this employment discrimination action,\n\nappellant    Dolores    Griel    alleges    that   she   was   wrongfully\n\nterminated as a nurse in the critical care unit of appellee\n\nFranklin Medical Center.        She claims that the discharge occurred\n\nbecause of her status as a recovering drug addict and thereby\n\nviolated the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation\n\nAct of 1973, and the Massachusetts anti-discrimination statute.1\n\nAppellee pointed to evidence showing that the discharge took\n\nplace after incidents in which Griel had violated protocol\n\nrequirements during the care of patients.            The district court\n\ngranted summary judgment, finding that no reasonable jury could\n\ndisbelieve this asserted, nondiscriminatory reason.\n\n            Because the evidence is set forth in detail in the\n\ndistrict court opinion, see Griel v. Franklin Med. Ctr., 71 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 1, 4-6 (D. Mass. 1999), we confine ourselves to a very\n\nbrief description.        Griel was hired in July 1992, after she\n\ncandidly acknowledged that she was a recovering drug addict who\n\nhad   previously   been    terminated     for   diverting   narcotics   in\n\nanother hospital.      At the time of hiring, she was involved in a\n\n\n\n      1\n     Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101-12117;\nthe Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794; the\nMassachusetts anti-discrimination act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B.\n\n                                    -2-\n\ffive-year     rehabilitation        program    to   assist      nurses   in   the\n\nsituation.          For   several   years     she   performed     well   at   the\n\nhospital, but in 1995 she injured her back while lifting a\n\npatient and had to take a year away from Franklin, taking a\n\nprescribed narcotic for pain control.\n\n             On her return to Franklin in late 1996, a co-worker\n\nraised concerns about Griel's nursing, and an acting supervisor\n\nconcluded that Griel's patients were receiving narcotics too\n\nreadily and in        excessive amounts.       Griel was briefly suspended\n\nand after a new manager took charge, he agreed with the concerns\n\nand brought Griel back to work with restrictions.                  Thereafter,\n\na   report    was    made   that    Griel     had   been   rummaging     through\n\ndiscarded medication bottles and she was asked to take a drug\n\ntest.    After some delay, Griel took the test and the report was\n\nnegative.\n\n             In     March   1997,    Griel     returned    to    work    without\n\nrestrictions but in the course of the next two weeks there\n\noccurred two more incidents.           First, Griel asked a new nurse to\n\nadminister a drug drawn by Griel--a violation of protocol--and\n\nthen initially denied doing so before she ultimately admitted\n\nit.     Thereafter, Griel administered a dose of drugs to another\n\npatient without acquiring the required co-signature for surplus\n\nnarcotics that she wasted or recording one of the doses in the\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fmedication records or her nurse's notes.                 After a disciplinary\n\nhearing, Griel was terminated as presenting an unacceptable risk\n\nto patient safety.\n\n            At the summary judgment stage, Griel relied primarily\n\nupon the presumption and burden-adjusting framework established\n\nin   McDonnell    Douglas     Corp.    v.    Green,    411    U.S.   792    (1973).\n\nRecognizing      that   Franklin      had    proffered   an    explanation      for\n\ndischarge      that     was   on     its     face   nondiscriminatory,         she\n\nconcentrated her attack on showing that the explanation was\n\npretextual--or at least that there was enough evidence to take\n\nthis issue to a jury--by showing that many others nurses had\n\nmade errors in narcotics administration without being dismissed\n\nand that in specific cases other nurses were given verbal or\n\nwritten warnings or were required to take training to remedy\n\nmistakes.      After discussing the evidence on both sides, the\n\ndistrict court concluded that there was \"no evidence that would\n\nremotely justify a jury in concluding [that] a nurse who was not\n\na former substance abuser, and who committed a similar pattern\n\nof   similar     mistakes,     was     not    (or     would    not   have    been)\n\nterminated.\"      Griel, 171 F. Supp. 2d at 12.\n\n            Our review of the entry of summary judgment is de novo,\n\nand we take the inferences in the light most favorable to the\n\nnonmoving party.        See Thomas v. Eastman Kodak Co., 183 F.3d 38,\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f47   1st   Cir.   1999),       cert.   denied,       120       S.    Ct.   1174     (2000).\n\nGriel's main challenge in this appeal is to the district court's\n\nassessment of the evidence.            Specifically, Griel points out that\n\nher own experts defended Griel's substantive decisions as to\n\ndrugs administered to patients that worried hospital managers;\n\nshe says that there was direct evidence of animus against her;\n\nand she says that her protocol violations were ameliorated by\n\nsurrounding circumstances and by the fact that they occurred\n\noften enough with other nurses.\n\n            If    the    question      in    this    case      was     whether      Griel's\n\nmedical    choices      were      defensible,       quite      possibly       the    expert\n\nevidence she offered would have created a jury issue.                               But the\n\nultimate    issue       in    a    discrimination          case       is     whether     the\n\nhospital's reason for discharging her was because it believed\n\nthat she was not a safe nurse, primarily because of violations\n\nof   protocol      in    the      administration          of        narcotics     and,    in\n\nparticular,       on    Griel's      violation       of        the    \"you      draw,    you\n\nadminister\" rule.         \"The evidence is essentially unrebutted that\n\nviolating this rule is rare and very serious [and]                              [a]lthough\n\nplaintiff's experts rebut the seriousness and rarity of the\n\ndocumentation      and       co-sign   problems,       they          are   conspicuously\n\nsilent about Griel's violation of this rule.\"                              Griel, 71 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 12 (footnote omitted).\n\n\n                                            -5-\n\f             Next, it is quite true that there was some evidence\n\nthat   the    hospital        was    especially          concerned     when       Griel,\n\napparently recovered from her past affliction, began to make\n\nsubstantive medical decisions that managers thought indicated an\n\nexcessive propensity to prescribe narcotics.                     But the remarks\n\nwere   triggered       by   what     the    managers       deemed    to      be    over-\n\nprescription; and as the district court pointed out, there is no\n\ndirect link between the remarks and any disparate treatment of\n\nGriel by the hospital.              Griel, 71 F. Supp. 2d at 13.                  It was\n\nonly after the incident of protocol violation that Franklin\n\nundertook to terminate Griel.\n\n             Lastly,    the    district          court   took   full      account     of\n\nevidence indicating that other nurses were not discharged, or in\n\nsome cases even disciplined, for individual mistakes.                         But the\n\ndistrict court properly pointed out that no other nurse was\n\nidentified as committing a series of protocol mistakes in a\n\nrather brief period, one of which was an extremely serious\n\nviolation; and while the hospital did not fire the nurse who\n\nactually administered the drugs for Griel in violation of the\n\n\"you draw, you administer\" rule, she was a new and inexperienced\n\nnurse who forthrightly acknowledged her mistake, while Griel\n\n\"equivocated.\"      Griel, 71 F. Supp. 2d at 12.                     And there was\n\nevidence     that   Franklin        had    terminated       nurses     for    serious\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fviolations of hospital rules, even though there was no exact\n\ncounterpart to Griel's case.        Id.\n\n          We thus agree with the district court that Griel's\n\nevidence did not provide a reasonable jury any basis to doubt\n\nthat the hospital's motive in discharging Griel was a genuine\n\nconcern about her nursing practices.          Griel cites our recent\n\ndecision in Dominguez-Cruz v. Suttle Caribe, Inc., 202 F.3d 424\n\n(1st Cir. 2000), but we see no inconsistency.             In that case,\n\ninvolving age discrimination, we found that the employer had\n\ngiven different and arguably inconsistent explanations for the\n\ntermination, and that there was affirmative evidence to suggest\n\nthat the principal explanation was not in fact the true reason\n\nfor the termination.       See id. at 431-32.        This alone explains\n\nwhy Dominguez-Cruz is not in point.\n\n          The legal framework for analyzing discrimination claims\n\nhas been altered since the district court's decision by Reeves\n\nv. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 120 S. Ct. 2097 (2000),\n\nand--in Massachusetts--by Abramian v. President & Fellows of\n\nHarvard   College,   731   N.E.2d    1075   (Mass.    2000).

Franklin Med. Ctr., 71 F. Supp. 2d 1, 4-6 (D. Mass. 1999), we confine ourselves to a very brief description. Griel was hired in July 1992, after she candidly acknowledged that she was a recovering drug addict who had previously been terminated for diverting narcotics in another hospital. At the time of hiring, she was involved in a five-year rehabilitation program to assist nurses in the situation.

Recognizing that Franklin had proffered an explanation for discharge that was on its face nondiscriminatory, she concentrated her attack on showing that the explanation was pretextual--or at least that there was enough evidence to take this issue to a jury--by showing that many others nurses had made errors in narcotics administration without being dismissed and that in specific cases other nurses were given verbal or written warnings or were required to take training to remedy mistakes. After discussing the evidence on both sides, the district court concluded that there was \"no evidence that would remotely justify a jury in concluding [that] a nurse who was not a former substance abuser, and who committed a similar pattern of similar mistakes, was not (or would not have been) terminated.\" Griel, 171 F.

Specifically, Griel points out that her own experts defended Griel's substantive decisions as to drugs administered to patients that worried hospital managers; she says that there was direct evidence of animus against her; and she says that her protocol violations were ameliorated by surrounding circumstances and by the fact that they occurred often enough with other nurses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the question in this case was whether Griel's medical choices were defensible, quite possibly the expert evidence she offered would have created a jury issue. But the ultimate issue in a discrimination case is whether the hospital's reason for discharging her was because it believed that she was not a safe nurse, primarily because of violations of protocol in the administration of narcotics and, in particular, on Griel's violation of the \"you draw, you administer\" rule. \"The evidence is essentially unrebutted that violating this rule is rare and very serious [and] [a]lthough plaintiff's experts rebut the seriousness and rarity of the documentation and co-sign problems, they are conspicuously silent about Griel's violation of this rule.\" Griel, 71 F.

But the remarks were triggered by what the managers deemed to be over-prescription; and as the district court pointed out, there is no direct link between the remarks and any disparate treatment of Griel by the hospital. Griel, 71 F. Supp. 2d at 13. It was only after the incident of protocol violation that Franklin undertook to terminate Griel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, the district court took full account of evidence indicating that other nurses were not discharged, or in some cases even disciplined, for individual mistakes. But the district court properly pointed out that no other nurse was identified as committing a series of protocol mistakes in a rather brief period, one of which was an extremely serious violation; and while the hospital did not fire the nurse who actually administered the drugs for Griel in violation of the \"you draw, you administer\" rule, she was a new and inexperienced nurse who forthrightly acknowledged her mistake, while Griel \"equivocated.\" Griel, 71 F.

Franklin Med. Ctr., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2515420\"><a href=\"/opinion/2515420/griel-v-franklin-medical-center/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4-6 (D. Mass. 1999), we confine ourselves to a very brief description. Griel was hired in July 1992, after she candidly acknowledged that she was a recovering drug addict who had previously been terminated for diverting narcotics in another hospital. At the time of hiring, she was involved in a five-year rehabilitation program to assist nurses in the situation. For several years she performed well at the hospital, but in 1995 she injured her back while lifting a patient and had to take a year away from Franklin, taking a prescribed narcotic for pain control.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On her return to Franklin in late 1996, a co-worker raised concerns about Griel's nursing, and an acting supervisor concluded that Griel's patients were receiving narcotics too readily and in excessive amounts. Griel was briefly suspended and after a new manager took charge, he agreed with the concerns and brought Griel back to work with restrictions. Thereafter, a report was made that Griel had been rummaging through discarded medication bottles and she was asked to take a drug test. After some delay, Griel took the test and the report was negative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1997, Griel returned to work without restrictions but in the course of the next two weeks there occurred two more incidents. First, Griel asked a new nurse to administer a drug drawn by Griel--a violation of protocol--and then initially denied doing so before she ultimately admitted it. Thereafter, Griel administered a dose of drugs to another patient without acquiring the required co-signature for surplus narcotics that she wasted or recording one of the doses in the medication records or her nurse's notes. After a disciplinary hearing, Griel was terminated as presenting an unacceptable risk to patient safety.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the summary judgment stage, Griel relied primarily upon the presumption and burden-adjusting framework established in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span> (1973). Recognizing that Franklin had proffered an explanation for discharge that was on its face nondiscriminatory, she concentrated her attack on showing that the explanation was pretextual--or at least that there was enough evidence to take this issue to a jury--by showing that many others nurses had made errors in narcotics administration without being dismissed and that in specific cases other nurses were given verbal or written warnings or were required to take training to remedy mistakes. After discussing the evidence on both sides, the district court concluded that there was \"no evidence that would remotely justify a jury in concluding [that] a nurse who was not a former substance abuser, and who committed a similar pattern of similar mistakes, was not (or would not have been) terminated.\" Griel, 171 F. Supp. 2d at 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the entry of summary judgment is de novo, and we take the inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See Thomas v. Eastman Kodak Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></span>, 47 1st Cir. 1999), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1174</span></span> (2000). Griel's main challenge in this appeal is to the district court's assessment of the evidence. Specifically, Griel points out that her own experts defended Griel's substantive decisions as to drugs administered to patients that worried hospital managers; she says that there was direct evidence of animus against her; and she says that her protocol violations were ameliorated by surrounding circumstances and by the fact that they occurred often enough with other nurses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the question in this case was whether Griel's medical choices were defensible, quite possibly the expert evidence she offered would have created a jury issue. But the ultimate issue in a discrimination case is whether the hospital's reason for discharging her was because it believed that she was not a safe nurse, primarily because of violations of protocol in the administration of narcotics and, in particular, on Griel's violation of the \"you draw, you administer\" rule. \"The evidence is essentially unrebutted that violating this rule is rare and very serious [and] [a]lthough plaintiff's experts rebut the seriousness and rarity of the documentation and co-sign problems, they are conspicuously silent about Griel's violation of this rule.\" Griel, 71 F. Supp. 2d at 12 (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, it is quite true that there was some evidence that the hospital was especially concerned when Griel, apparently recovered from her past affliction, began to make substantive medical decisions that managers thought indicated an excessive propensity to prescribe narcotics. But the remarks were triggered by what the managers deemed to be over-prescription; and as the district court pointed out, there is no direct link between the remarks and any disparate treatment of Griel by the hospital. Griel, 71 F. Supp. 2d at 13. It was only after the incident of protocol violation that Franklin undertook to terminate Griel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, the district court took full account of evidence indicating that other nurses were not discharged, or in some cases even disciplined, for individual mistakes. But the district court properly pointed out that no other nurse was identified as committing a series of protocol mistakes in a rather brief period, one of which was an extremely serious violation; and while the hospital did not fire the nurse who actually administered the drugs for Griel in violation of the \"you draw, you administer\" rule, she was a new and inexperienced nurse who forthrightly acknowledged her mistake, while Griel \"equivocated.\" Griel, 71 F. Supp. 2d at 12. And there was evidence that Franklin had terminated nurses for serious violations of hospital rules, even though there was no exact counterpart to Griel's case. Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We thus agree with the district court that Griel's evidence did not provide a reasonable jury any basis to doubt that the hospital's motive in discharging Griel was a genuine concern about her nursing practices. Griel cites our recent decision in Dominguez-Cruz v. Suttle Caribe, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767480\"><a href=\"/opinion/767480/alberto-dominguez-cruz-and-nydia-negron-ramos-v-suttle-caribe-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">202</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 2000), but we see no inconsistency. In that case, involving age discrimination, we found that the employer had given different and arguably inconsistent explanations for the termination, and that there was affirmative evidence to suggest that the principal explanation was not in fact the true reason for the termination. See id. at 431-32. This alone explains why Dominguez-Cruz is not in point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legal framework for analyzing discrimination claims has been altered since the district court's decision by Reeves v.
