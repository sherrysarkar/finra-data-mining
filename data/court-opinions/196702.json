He now appeals his sentence, specifically the  court's\r\n\nrefusal  to grant the government's motion on his behalf for a\r\n\nfour  level downward  departure  for substantial  assistance.\r\n\nU.S.S.G. 5K1.1.  Normally an appeal is not available for such\r\n\na broadly discretionary  decision, United States v.  Mariano,\r                                                                        \r\n\n983  F.2d  1150, 1153-54  (1st Cir.  1993),  but there  is an\r\n\nexception in case of an error of law.  Id. at 1153; 18 U.S.C.\r                                                      \r\n\n  3742.1  This is  such a case.  Defendant makes  a colorable\r\n\nclaim  that his Fifth Amendment rights to due process and not\r\n\nto be made a  witness against himself were violated  when the\r\n\ncourt based its  decision to deny downward  departure, and to\r\n\ngive  the  maximum sentence  under  the  applicable guideline\r\n\nrange,  on self-incriminating  information  he  had  divulged\r\n\npursuant to a plea agreement  to provide the government  with\r\n\nsubstantial assistance in exchange  for immunity and a motion\r\n\nfor downward departure.2   Noting the standard provision that\r\n\nit was  not bound to accept  the government's recommendation,\r\n\nMariano, 983  F.2d at  1155, the  court, while  admitting the\r                   \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Appellate jurisdiction exists  for sentences \"imposed  in\r\nviolation  of  law.\"   18 U.S.C.     3742(a)(1).   See United\r                                                                         \r\nStates v. Drown, 942 F.2d 55, 58 and n.6 (1st Cir. 1991).\r                           \r\n\n2.  The possibility  that in  its discretion the  court might\r\nhave reached the same result absent any error does not defeat\r\njurisdiction.  See Drown, 942 F.2d at 60.\r                                    \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nsufficiency  of  defendant's   disclosures  to  warrant   the\r\n\ndeparture, denied  it on the ground that it would lead to too\r\n\nlight  a sentence  for a  defendant so  revealed.   Defendant\r\n\nobjects  that the effective \"countervailing factors\" found by\r\n\nthe court to \"militate against granting a motion for downward\r\n\ndeparture\" came to the court's attention solely by  reason of\r\n\ndisclosures he had  provided in exchange  for a promise  that\r\n\nthey would not be  used against him.   We concur, and  remand\r\n\nfor resentencing.\r\n\n          The plea agreement read as follows:\r\n\n          No truthful information  provided by  Mr.\r\n          Conway  to  government  attorneys or  law\r\n          enforcement  officers,  pursuant to  this\r\n          agreement, or any information directly or\r\n          indirectly derived from such information,\r\n          will be  used against Mr.  Conway by  the\r\n          government   provided  that   Mr.  Conway\r\n          complies   with   the   terms   of   this\r\n          agreement.  As to information provided by\r\n          Mr. Conway  regarding unlawful activities\r\n          involving himself and others that was not\r\n          known to the government prior to entering\r\n          into  this  agreement,  such  information\r\n          shall  not be  used  in  determining  the\r\n          applicable  guideline range,  pursuant to\r\n          U.S.S.G.   1B1.8.\r\n\n          It is clear, first of all, that the  plea agreement\r\n\ndoes  not  bind   the  court  \"to  comply  blindly  with  the\r\n\nprosecutor's wishes,\"  Mariano, 983  F.2d at 1155,  and that,\r                                          \r\n\nexcept  as   restricted  by  the  Guidelines,  other  federal\r\n\nstatutes,  or  the  United  States  Constitution,  the  court\r\n\n\"retains  broad discretion  to  exhume  factors unrelated  to\r\n\nsubstantial   assistance   before   burying  the   [guideline\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nsentencing range].\"  Id. at 1156-57.  We also  agree that the\r                                    \r\n\nlanguage   of  the  agreement,   as  written,   deserves  the\r\n\ninterpretation the court  gave it at the  time of sentencing:\r\n\ndefendant  received  a  promise  that,  (1)  the  information\r\n\ndisclosed  would not be used against him by the government --\r                                                                      \r\n\ne.g., as a basis for future prosecution, for refusing to make\r\n\na motion for  downward departure, or for any other government\r\n\naction  against  him --  and, (2)  it  would not  be  used in\r\n\ncalculating  his guideline range -- no more.  As written, the\r\n\nagreement does not preserve the blanket protection  defendant\r\n\nclaims he bargained for  in exchange for waiver of  his Fifth\r\n\nAmendment right not  to be  a witness against  himself.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited States v.  Hogan, 862  F.2d 386, 388  (1st Cir.  1988)\r                                   \r\n\n(plea agreements are to  be interpreted according to contract\r\n\nlaw principles).   So  interpreted, defendant cannot  state a\r\n\nclaim that his rights were violated.\r\n\n          There was,  however, a difficulty,  provided by the\r\n\ncourt itself.  At the hearing at which the court undertook to\r\n\ndetermine,  in lengthy  converse with  defendant,  whether he\r\n\nunderstood the consequences of entering the agreement and the\r\n\nplea,  see F.R.Crim.P.  11(c), the  court did  not quote  the\r                      \r\n\nagreement  fully.     After  explaining   to  defendant   his\r\n\nobligation  under  the  agreement  to  make   full,  truthful\r\n\ndisclosure,  and the  consequences  of failing  to do  so, it\r\n\nstated, \"Now,  any truthful information that  you provide the\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\ngovernment during the course of your  cooperation will not be\r\n\nused against you.\"   The original limitation, to  non-use \"by\r\n\nthe government,\" was omitted.  In all fairness, was defendant\r\n\nsupposed  to  remember it?   The  whole  purpose of  the plea\r\n\nhearing  is to  assure full  understanding.   The objectively\r\n\nreasonable understanding in defendant's  ears when he signed,\r\n\nsee  Hogan, 862  F.2d at  388,  was that  he was  assuming an\r                      \r\n\nobligation  to speak in  exchange for, among  other things, a\r\n\ngrant  of full use immunity for whatever he disclosed.  True,\r\n\nthe court went on to quote the agreement's provision that the\r\n\ninformation \"will  not be used in  determining the applicable\r\n\nguideline range,\"  which we  observe would be  superfluous if\r\n\nthe  prior  statement  is   interpreted  to  grant  full  use\r\n\nimmunity.   The implication, and the  principle inclusio unis\r                                                                         \r\n\nexclusio  alterius est  are  rules of  construction known  to\r                                  \r\n\nlawyers, but a defendant surely cannot be expected to apply a\r\n\nlawyer's   analytical   tools   in   a   colloquy   conducted\r\n\nspecifically  to  assure  his  lay  understanding.    We  are\r\n\nparticularly  loathe to  do so  when the  effect would  be to\r\n\ncontradict  apparent  absoluteness.   At  best,  the  court's\r\n\nsecond statement created an ambiguity that we must resolve in\r\n\nfavor of defendant's reasonable understanding.\r\n\n          The case comes down to this.  A plea agreement is a\r\n\ncontract   under  which   both   parties  give   and  receive\r\n\nconsideration.   The government obtains a  conviction that it\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\notherwise might not  have.   The defendant,  correspondingly,\r\n\nreceives less, or a  chance at less, than he  otherwise might\r\n\nhave.  In this case the government received something more --\r\n\ntangible disclosures concededly of substantial value in light\r\n\nof the return offered defendant (non-use of the information),\r\n\nwhich was promised  not merely as hope,  but as firm.   Under\r\n\nF.R.Crim.P.  11(e)(3) and (4) the  court may accept or reject\r\n\nthe agreement.  Here the court expressly  defined in absolute\r\n\nterms  the  benefit  defendant  should  expect.    Under  the\r\n\nagreement the court could have denied the government's motion\r\n\nfor  a downward departure, but it cannot be thought it should\r\n\ndo so by relying  on the very disclosures that  defendant was\r\n\nbargained  to  make  on   an  immunization  promise.    While\r\n\ndoubtless the court did  not recall this record inadvertency,\r\n\nsurely  due process, not to mention  public perception of the\r\n\ncourts, should forbid such a result.3\r\n\n          This  brings us to the  remand itself.   It will be\r\n\nopen to the court, after vacating the present sentence, again\r\n\nto address the issue  of a downward departure.  In this case,\r\n\nhowever,  the  court  should  not  change  the  finding  that\r\n\ndefendant   had  rendered   substantial  assistance   to  the\r\n\ngovernment, and if  it is to  be rebutted it  must be on  new\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  To the extent that U.S.S.G.   1B1.8(b)(5) and application\r\nnote   1  appear   to   the  contrary,   the   constitutional\r\nprerogatives in this case must prevail.\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nfindings, which  we suggest should be  stated, independent of\r\n\ndefendant's disclosures.\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\n          We  vacate  defendant's  sentence  and  remand  for\r\n\nresentencing.\r\n\n                 -Concurring opinion follows-\r                             -Concurring opinion follows-\r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\n          SELYA, Circuit Judge (concurring).  While I have no\r                      SELYA, Circuit Judge (concurring).\r                                          \r\n\ndoubt  that  the defendant  in  this  case  has been  treated\r\n\nfairly, I  agree with my  colleagues that the  combination of\r\n\nthe district  judge's unfortunate  slip of the  tongue during\r\n\nthe change-of-plea  hearing and his frank  use of information\r\n\nelicited  from the  defendant during  debriefing to  impose a\r\n\nsentence  at  the  top  of  the  guideline  range  creates  a\r\n\nperception  of  unfairness  and  requires   vacation  of  the\r\n\nsentence.   I  write separately,  however, to  highlight four\r\n\npoints.\r\n\n          First, this is not a case in which the court coaxed\r\n\na  plea  through  a  misrepresentation.   Mr.  Conway  is  an\r\n\nintelligent,  well-educated  businessman who  was represented\r\n\nthroughout by distinguished counsel.   Insofar as I can tell,\r\n\nhe was not actually misled and the judge's lapsus linguae had\r                                                                     \r\n\nno  actual   effect  on  the  course   of  the  proceedings.4\r\n\nNevertheless, I cannot vote to uphold the sentence.  When the\r\n\npublic  perception of  justice is  imperilled by  the court's\r\n\nactions in a criminal case, the usual rules of harmless error\r\n\ndo not apply.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  This conclusion is underscored,  if not compelled, by the\r\nlate  blossoming  of  any   argument  based  on  the  court's\r\nmisstatement at the change-of-plea hearing.   The defendant's\r\nbrief on appeal is devoid of developed argumentation  in this\r\nregard, and the judge's statement was first mentioned at oral\r\nargument in this court (and then, only in passing).\r\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\n          Second, it is important to emphasize that this case\r\n\nis sui generis.  Under ordinary circumstances, the guidelines\r                          \r\n\npermit  information  obtained  from a  cooperating  defendant\r\n\nduring debriefing  to be used in  determining the defendant's\r\n\nsentence (as long  as the  plea agreement does  not impose  a\r\n\nfurther limitation on these uses).  See U.S.S.G.  1B1.8(b)(5)\r                                                   \r\n\n&amp; n.1.\r\n\n          Third, the plea agreement in this case, interpreted\r\n\nunder principles of contract law, see United States v. Hogan,\r                                                                        \r\n\n862  F.2d 386, 388 (1st  Cir. 1988), imposed  no such special\r\n\nlimitation.    Were  it   not  for  the  judge's  inadvertent\r\n\nmisstatement  during the  change-of-plea colloquy,  the court\r\n\ncould have  used the  information obtained  during debriefing\r\n\neither  to  deny  the  downward  departure,  or  to  fix  the\r\n\ndefendant's sentence within  the appropriate guideline range,\r\n\nor for both purposes.\r\n\n          Fourth,  under the plea  agreement, the guidelines,\r\n\nand binding precedent in  this circuit, see United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nMariano, 983 F.2d  1150, 1157 (1st  Cir. 1993), the  district\r                   \r\n\ncourt was obliged fully  to consider the elicited information\r\n\nin  determining whether  to  grant  the government's  section\r\n\n5K1.1  motion for  a  downward  departure.   On  remand,  the\r\n\ndistrict  court   remains   obliged  to   consider  all   the\r\n\ninformation.  And, moreover, even if the court finds that the\r\n\ndefendant substantially assisted the investigation, it is not\r\n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\nobligated  to  grant  the  section 5K1.1  motion  and  depart\r\n\ndownward,   see   Mariano,   983   F.2d   at   1156-57,   or,\r                                     \r\n\nalternatively,  to impose  a sentence  at the  bottom of  the\r\n\nguideline range.\r\n\n          Despite the court's substantial discretion in these\r\n\nrespects,  I agree  with my  colleagues that  resentencing is\r\n\nrequired.   When, as now, a sentencing court makes clear that\r\n\na discretionary action   even a discretionary action that the\r\n\ncourt  has  no  legal obligation  to  explain  at  all5    is\r\n\npremised  on an  impermissible  consideration, the  court  of\r\n\nappeals must intervene.  See United States v. Drown, 942 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n55, 60  (1st Cir. 1991).   To this  extent, the judge  pays a\r\n\nhigh price for candor   but justice demands the exaction.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  A good example, apropos here, is that, subject to certain\r\nexceptions  not  relevant  in  the circumstances  at  bar,  a\r\nsentencing court  has no legal  obligation to explain  why it\r\nchooses  a  particular  sentence within  a  narrowly  defined\r\nguideline  sentencing range.    See, e.g.,  United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\nLevinson,  56 F.3d 780, 780 (7th Cir. 1995); United States v.\r                                                                      \r\nGarrido, 38 F.3d 981,  986 (8th Cir. 1994); United  States v.\r                                                                      \r\nLively,  20 F.3d 193, 198 (6th Cir.  1994).  By like token, a\r                  \r\nsentencing court  customarily need not explain  the basis for\r\nits  refusal to depart downward.  See, e.g., United States v.\r                                                                      \r\nLombardi, 5 F.3d 568, 572 (1st Cir. 1993).\r                    \r\n\n                             -11-\r\r\n",

Conway pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud the American Honda Motor Company in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1343 and 1346.   He now appeals his sentence, specifically the court's refusal to grant the government's motion on his behalf for a four level downward departure for substantial assistance.   U.S.S.G. 5K1.1.   Normally an appeal is not available for such a broadly discretionary decision, United States v. Mariano, 983 F.2d 1150, 1153-54 (1st Cir.1993), but there is an exception in case of an error of law.  Id. at 1153;  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  This is such a case.   Defendant makes a colorable claim that his Fifth Amendment rights to due process and not to be made a witness against himself were violated when the court based its decision to deny downward departure, and to give the maximum sentence under the applicable guideline range, on self-incriminating information he had divulged pursuant to a plea agreement to provide the government with substantial assistance in exchange for immunity and a motion for downward departure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Noting the standard provision that it was not bound to accept the government's recommendation, Mariano, 983 F.2d at 1155, the court, while admitting the sufficiency of defendant's disclosures to warrant the departure, denied it on the ground that it would lead to too light a sentence for a defendant so revealed.   Defendant objects that the effective \"countervailing factors\" found by the court to \"militate against granting a motion for downward departure\" came to the court's attention solely by reason of disclosures he had provided in exchange for a promise that they would not be used against him.   We concur, and remand for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The plea agreement read as follows:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p>No truthful information provided by Mr. Conway to government attorneys or law enforcement officers, pursuant to this agreement, or any information directly or indirectly derived from such information, will be used against Mr. Conway by the government provided that Mr. Conway complies with the terms of this agreement.   As to information provided by Mr. Conway regarding unlawful activities involving himself and others that was not known to the government prior to entering into this agreement, such information shall not be used in determining the applicable guideline range, pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear, first of all, that the plea agreement does not bind the court \"to comply blindly with the prosecutor's wishes,\" Mariano, 983 F.2d at 1155, and that, except as restricted by the Guidelines, other federal statutes, or the United States Constitution, the court \"retains broad discretion to exhume factors unrelated to substantial assistance before burying the [guideline sentencing range].\"  Id. at 1156-57.   We also agree that the language of the agreement, as written, deserves the interpretation the court gave it at the time of sentencing:  defendant received a promise that, (1) the information disclosed would not be used against him by the government--e.g., as a basis for future prosecution, for refusing to make a motion for downward departure, or for any other government action against him--and, (2) it would not be used in calculating his guideline range--no more.   As written, the agreement does not preserve the blanket protection defendant claims he bargained for in exchange for waiver of his Fifth Amendment right not to be a witness against himself.   See United States v. Hogan, 862 F.2d 386, 388 (1st Cir.1988) (plea agreements are to be interpreted according to contract law principles).   So interpreted, defendant cannot state a claim that his rights were violated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was, however, a difficulty, provided by the court itself.   At the hearing at which the court undertook to determine, in lengthy converse with defendant, whether he understood the consequences of entering the agreement and the plea, see F.R.Crim.P. 11(c), the court did not quote the agreement fully.   After explaining to defendant his obligation under the agreement to make full, truthful disclosure, and the consequences of failing to do so, it stated, \"Now, any truthful information that you provide the government during the course of your cooperation will not be used against you.\"   The original limitation, to non-use \"by the government,\" was omitted.   In all fairness, was defendant supposed to remember it?   The whole purpose of the plea hearing is to assure full understanding.   The objectively reasonable understanding in defendant's ears when he signed, see Hogan, 862 F.2d at 388, was that he was assuming an obligation to speak in exchange for, among other things, a grant of full use immunity for whatever he disclosed.   True, the court went on to quote the agreement's provision that the information \"will not be used in determining the applicable guideline range,\" which we observe would be superfluous if the prior statement is interpreted to grant full use immunity.   The implication, and the principle inclusio unis exclusio alterius est are rules of construction known to lawyers, but a defendant surely cannot be expected to apply a lawyer's analytical tools in a colloquy conducted specifically to assure his lay understanding.   We are particularly loathe to do so when the effect would be to contradict apparent absoluteness.   At best, the court's second statement created an ambiguity that we must resolve in favor of defendant's reasonable understanding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case comes down to this.   A plea agreement is a contract under which both parties give and receive consideration.   The government obtains a conviction that it otherwise might not have.   The defendant, correspondingly, receives less, or a chance at less, than he otherwise might have.   In this case the government received something more--tangible disclosures concededly of substantial value in light of the return offered defendant (non-use of the information), which was promised not merely as hope, but as firm.   Under F.R.Crim.P. 11(e)(3) and (4) the court may accept or reject the agreement.   Here the court expressly defined in absolute terms the benefit defendant should expect.   Under the agreement the court could have denied the government's motion for a downward departure, but it cannot be thought it should do so by relying on the very disclosures that defendant was bargained to make on an immunization promise.   While doubtless the court did not recall this record inadvertency, surely due process, not to mention public perception of the courts, should forbid such a result.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the remand itself.   It will be open to the court, after vacating the present sentence, again to address the issue of a downward departure.   In this case, however, the court should not change the finding that defendant had rendered substantial assistance to the government, and if it is to be rebutted it must be on new findings, which we suggest should be stated, independent of defendant's disclosures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We vacate defendant's sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SELYA, Circuit Judge, concurring.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While I have no doubt that the defendant in this case has been treated fairly, I agree with my colleagues that the combination of the district judge's unfortunate slip of the tongue during the change-of-plea hearing and his frank use of information elicited from the defendant during debriefing to impose a sentence at the top of the guideline range creates a perception of unfairness and requires vacation of the sentence.   I write separately, however, to highlight four points.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, this is not a case in which the court coaxed a plea through a misrepresentation.   Mr. Conway is an intelligent, well-educated businessman who was represented throughout by distinguished counsel.   Insofar as I can tell, he was not actually misled and the judge's lapsus linguae had no actual effect on the course of the proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Nevertheless, I cannot vote to uphold the sentence.   When the public perception of justice is imperilled by the court's actions in a criminal case, the usual rules of harmless error do not apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, it is important to emphasize that this case is sui generis.   Under ordinary circumstances, the guidelines permit information obtained from a cooperating defendant during debriefing to be used in determining the defendant's sentence (as long as the plea agreement does not impose a further limitation on these uses).   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.8(b)(5) &amp; n. 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the plea agreement in this case, interpreted under principles of contract law, see United States v. Hogan, 862 F.2d 386, 388 (1st Cir.1988), imposed no such special limitation.   Were it not for the judge's inadvertent misstatement during the change-of-plea colloquy, the court could have used the information obtained during debriefing either to deny the downward departure, or to fix the defendant's sentence within the appropriate guideline range, or for both purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, under the plea agreement, the guidelines, and binding precedent in this circuit, see United States v. Mariano, 983 F.2d 1150, 1157 (1st Cir.1993), the district court was obliged fully to consider the elicited information in determining whether to grant the government's section 5K1.1 motion for a downward departure.   On remand, the district court remains obliged to consider all the information.   And, moreover, even if the court finds that the defendant substantially assisted the investigation, it is not obligated to grant the section 5K1.1 motion and depart downward, see Mariano, 983 F.2d at 1156-57, or, alternatively, to impose a sentence at the bottom of the guideline range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the court's substantial discretion in these respects, I agree with my colleagues that resentencing is required.   When, as now, a sentencing court makes clear that a discretionary action--even a discretionary action that the court has no legal obligation to explain at all<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>--is premised on an impermissible consideration, the court of appeals must intervene.   See United States v. Drown, 942 F.2d 55, 60 (1st Cir.1991).   To this extent, the judge pays a high price for candor--but justice demands the exaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Appellate jurisdiction exists for sentences \"imposed in violation of law.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(a)(1).   See United States v. Drown, 942 F.2d 55, 58 and n. 6 (1st Cir.1991)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The possibility that in its discretion the court might have reached the same result absent any error does not defeat jurisdiction.   See Drown, 942 F.2d at 60</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> To the extent that U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.8(b)(5) and application note 1 appear to the contrary, the constitutional prerogatives in this case must prevail</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> This conclusion is underscored, if not compelled, by the late blossoming of any argument based on the court's misstatement at the change-of-plea hearing.   The defendant's brief on appeal is devoid of developed argumentation in this regard, and the judge's statement was first mentioned at oral argument in this court (and then, only in passing)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> A good example, apropos here, is that, subject to certain exceptions not relevant in the circumstances at bar, a sentencing court has no legal obligation to explain why it chooses a particular sentence within a narrowly defined guideline sentencing range.   See, e.g., United States v. Levinson, 56 F.3d 780, 780 (7th Cir.1995);  United States v. Garrido, 38 F.3d 981, 986 (8th Cir.1994);  United States v. Lively, 20 F.3d 193, 198 (6th Cir.1994).   By like token, a sentencing court customarily need not explain the basis for its refusal to depart downward.   See, e.g., United States v. Lombardi, 5 F.3d 568, 572 (1st Cir.1993)</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

While doubtless the court did not recall this record inadvertency, surely due process, not to mention public perception of the courts, should forbid such a result.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the remand itself.   It will be open to the court, after vacating the present sentence, again to address the issue of a downward departure.   In this case, however, the court should not change the finding that defendant had rendered substantial assistance to the government, and if it is to be rebutted it must be on new findings, which we suggest should be stated, independent of defendant's disclosures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We vacate defendant's sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SELYA, Circuit Judge, concurring.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While I have no doubt that the defendant in this case has been treated fairly, I agree with my colleagues that the combination of the district judge's unfortunate slip of the tongue during the change-of-plea hearing and his frank use of information elicited from the defendant during debriefing to impose a sentence at the top of the guideline range creates a perception of unfairness and requires vacation of the sentence.   I write separately, however, to highlight four points.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, this is not a case in which the court coaxed a plea through a misrepresentation.   Mr. Conway is an intelligent, well-educated businessman who was represented throughout by distinguished counsel.   Insofar as I can tell, he was not actually misled and the judge's lapsus linguae had no actual effect on the course of the proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Nevertheless, I cannot vote to uphold the sentence.   When the public perception of justice is imperilled by the court's actions in a criminal case, the usual rules of harmless error do not apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, it is important to emphasize that this case is sui generis.   Under ordinary circumstances, the guidelines permit information obtained from a cooperating defendant during debriefing to be used in determining the defendant's sentence (as long as the plea agreement does not impose a further limitation on these uses).   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.8(b)(5) &amp; n. 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the plea agreement in this case, interpreted under principles of contract law, see United States v. Hogan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"515175\"><a href=\"/opinion/515175/united-states-v-mark-hogan-and-patricia-hogan/\"><span class=\"volume\">862</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span>, 388 (1st Cir.1988), imposed no such special limitation.   Were it not for the judge's inadvertent misstatement during the change-of-plea colloquy, the court could have used the information obtained during debriefing either to deny the downward departure, or to fix the defendant's sentence within the appropriate guideline range, or for both purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, under the plea agreement, the guidelines, and binding precedent in this circuit, see United States v. Mariano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"598971\"><a href=\"/opinion/598971/united-states-v-abel-a-mariano-jr-united-states-of-america-v-barry/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1150</span></a></span>, 1157 (1st Cir.1993), the district court was obliged fully to consider the elicited information in determining whether to grant the government's section 5K1.1 motion for a downward departure.   On remand, the district court remains obliged to consider all the information.   And, moreover, even if the court finds that the defendant substantially assisted the investigation, it is not obligated to grant the section 5K1.1 motion and depart downward, see Mariano, 983 F.2d at 1156-57, or, alternatively, to impose a sentence at the bottom of the guideline range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the court's substantial discretion in these respects, I agree with my colleagues that resentencing is required.   When, as now, a sentencing court makes clear that a discretionary action--even a discretionary action that the court has no legal obligation to explain at all<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>--is premised on an impermissible consideration, the court of appeals must intervene.   See United States v. Drown, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566799\"><a href=\"/opinion/566799/united-states-v-peter-alden-drown-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span>, 60 (1st Cir.1991).   To this extent, the judge pays a high price for candor--but justice demands the exaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Appellate jurisdiction exists for sentences \"imposed in violation of law.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(a)(1).   See United States v. Drown, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566799\"><a href=\"/opinion/566799/united-states-v-peter-alden-drown-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span>, 58 and n. 6 (1st Cir.1991)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The possibility that in its discretion the court might have reached the same result absent any error does not defeat jurisdiction.   See Drown, 942 F.2d at 60</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> To the extent that U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.8(b)(5) and application note 1 appear to the contrary, the constitutional prerogatives in this case must prevail</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> This conclusion is underscored, if not compelled, by the late blossoming of any argument based on the court's misstatement at the change-of-plea hearing.   The defendant's brief on appeal is devoid of developed argumentation in this regard, and the judge's statement was first mentioned at oral argument in this court (and then, only in passing)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> A good example, apropos here, is that, subject to certain exceptions not relevant in the circumstances at bar, a sentencing court has no legal obligation to explain why it chooses a particular sentence within a narrowly defined guideline sentencing range.   See, e.g., United States v. Levinson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"697305\"><a href=\"/opinion/697305/united-states-v-alan-levinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">780</span></a></span>, 780 (7th Cir.1995);  United States v. Garrido, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"681047\"><a href=\"/opinion/681047/united-states-v-jose-hernandez-garrido-united-states-of-america-v-ismael/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">981</span></a></span>, 986 (8th Cir.1994);  United States v. Lively, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"666582\"><a href=\"/opinion/666582/united-states-v-helen-l-lively-aka-helen-flugga/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span>, 198 (6th Cir.1994).   By like token, a sentencing court customarily need not explain the basis for its refusal to depart downward.   See, e.g., United States v. Lombardi, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194934\"><a href=\"/opinion/194934/united-states-v-lombardi/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">568</span></a></span>, 572 (1st Cir.1993)</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
