Pro  se appellant  Mark  Merrifield\r                                 \r\n\nappeals from  the district court's grant  of summary judgment\r\n\nagainst  him in  his 42  U.S.C.    1983 suit  against various\r\n\nlocal  government defendants.   After  careful review  of the\r\n\nrecord, we conclude that  most of Merrifield's contentions on\r\n\nappeal  lack  merit.    Accordingly, we  affirm  judgment  in\r\n\ndefendants' favor  essentially for  the reasons given  in the\r\n\ndistrict court's orders issued on  December 19, 1995, and  on\r\n\nJuly 2, 1996.   However, we affirm dismissal of  Merrifield's\r\n\nclaims against Barnstable town police officer Nancy Blanchard\r\n\nfor the reasons given below.  \r\n\n          We note that  the record gives rise  to an isolated\r\n\nissue of fact  as to whether  sworn statements or  affidavits\r                                               \r\n\nwere  submitted.   The  Fourth  Amendment  warrant clause  is\r\n\ndirected to sworn statements and it is not certain that sworn\r\n\nstatements, either written or oral, were submitted in support\r\n\nof the  arrest warrant  which Officer Blanchard  obtained and\r\n\nrelied  on in  arresting  Merrifield on  September 17,  1992.\r\n\nBut, for reasons  that follow,  we do not  think any  purpose\r\n\nwould be served by a remand to explore  this factual issue in\r\n\nfurther detail or to determine whether on the facts so found,\r\n\na constitutional  violation might exist (and,  if so, whether\r\n\nany damages could be established).\r\n\n     The reason why this is unnecessary is that the thrust of\r\n\nMerrifield's   1983 action  is for malicious prosecution, not\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nmerely for wrongful arrest.   Merrifield asserts not  just an\r\n\nabsence of  sworn affidavits  to support the  arrest warrant,\r\n\nbut  that the  charges  against him  were  \"bogus\", that  the\r\n\nwarrant  was maliciously  obtained, and  that, in  effect, it\r\n\nlacked any factual  basis.  A judgment  in Merrifield's favor\r\n\nwould  consequently imply  the invalidity  of his  subsequent\r\n\nconviction  of  the  charges   for  which  he  was  arrested.\r\n\nAccordingly,  since  Merrifield   has  not  shown  that   his\r\n\nconviction  has already  been invalidated,  his suit  must be\r\n\ndismissed.   See  Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S.  477, 486 (1994)\r                                              \r\n\n(if  judgment in a   1983 plaintiff's favor would necessarily\r\n\nimply the invalidity of his conviction, the complaint must be\r\n\ndismissed  unless  the  plaintiff can  demonstrate  that  the\r\n\nconviction has  already been  invalidated).   We note  that a\r\n\ndismissal under Heck is without prejudice.  See Guzman-Rivera\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Rivera-Cruz, 29 F.3d 3, 6 (1st Cir. 1994).\r                          \r\n\n          During  the course  of  this action,  the  district\r\n\ncourt dismissed  two  defendants  --  Clerk  Magistrate  Omer\r\n\nChartrand and defense counsel John Biega -- without prejudice\r\n\nsince they had never been served with process.  We modify the\r\n\njudgment in their favor to be with prejudice since Merrifield\r                                              \r\n\ncould  not bring  suit  against them  at  all under     1983.\r\n\nChartrand was absolutely immune for his decision to issue the\r\n\narrest  warrant.   See Scott  v. Dixon,  720 F.2d  1542, 1546\r                                                  \r\n\n(11th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 832 (1984); see also\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nBoyer  v.

See Polk  County v. Dodson,  454\r                                                                   \r\n\nU.S. 312, 325 (1981).\r\n\n          Affirmed.
