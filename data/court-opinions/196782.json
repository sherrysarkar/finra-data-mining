Following a plea of guilty to one\r                                       \r\n\ncount of  possessing heroin  with intent to  distribute, Robert\r\n\nRaposa was sentenced to a  term of 30 months imprisonment.   He\r\n\nappeals   that  sentence,  arguing   that  the  district  court\r\n\nerroneously  included  as  \"relevant  conduct,\"   see  U.S.S.G.\r                                                                 \r\n\n  1B1.3 (Nov. 1994), his possession, with intent to distribute,\r\n\nof a substantial quantity of cocaine that the court had earlier\r\n\nordered  suppressed as the product  of an illegal  search.  The\r\n\nconsideration,  inter  alia,  of   the  suppressed  cocaine  as\r\n\n\"relevant   conduct\"   increased  the   defendant's  Guidelines\r\n\nsentencing range from 10-16 months to 30-37 months.  The latter\r\n\nwas  the same  as the  range  that would  have obtained  if the\r\n\ndefendant  had been convicted on  the cocaine count  as well as\r                                         \r\n\nthe heroin count.\r\n\n       We  are asked  to  decide whether  the Fourth  Amendment\r\n\nexclusionary  rule   applies  in  the  context   of  Sentencing\r\n\nGuidelines proceedings, at least on the facts of this case.  On\r\n\nthe record before us, however,  the resolution of that question\r\n\nis not necessary  to the decision of this appeal.   We decline,\r\n\ntherefore, to reach that important question here, preferring to\r\n\nleave it for a future case.  Instead, we affirm the defendant's\r\n\nsentence on the  ground that the district court's findings were\r\n\namply supported  by statements concerning the  cocaine provided\r\n\nby   the   defendant  and   incorporated  in   the  Presentence\r\n\nInvestigation Report (\"PSR\"), and on which  he relied to obtain\r\n\na reduction in his sentence for acceptance of responsibility.\r\n\n                              -2-\r\r\n\n                               I\r\n\n       On  February   10,   1995,  two   narcotics   detectives\r\n\ninterrupted a drug  deal in  progress in an  alley in  downtown\r\n\nProvidence.   The defendant, Robert  Raposa, was sitting in the\r\n\ndriver's seat of a parked  white Mercury Sable, doing  business\r\n\nwith several  men standing at  his window, when  the detectives\r\n\napproached   and  identified  themselves  as  police  officers.\r\n\nRaposa bolted  out of  the car  and ran,  dropping a  bundle of\r\n\nheroin  packets labelled  \"Die Hard\" as  he fled.   One  of the\r\n\nofficers picked up the  heroin packets and gave chase.   Raposa\r\n\nwas apprehended.  The officers brought him back to the scene of\r\n\nthe drug deal, where they found another bundle of heroin marked\r\n\n\"Die Hard\" and  $140 in  cash on the  ground near the  Mercury.\r\n\nTwo  beepers  were  found  on  the  defendant, and  a  cellular\r\n\ntelephone in  the car.   Raposa was arrested  and taken to  the\r\n\ncentral police station.\r\n\n       After  a  short investigation,  the  detectives  went to\r\n\nRaposa's apartment, while the  defendant remained in custody at\r\n\nthe station.  A woman answered the door.  The officers told her\r\n\nthat  Raposa had been arrested.   The woman  stated that Raposa\r\n\nwas her boyfriend and lived with her in the apartment.\r\n\n       What happened  next was disputed.   The government would\r\n\nlater  assert that  the  woman consented  to  a search  of  the\r\n\napartment, and  that no search  was undertaken until  a consent\r\n\nform  had been  signed.   The defendant  would contend  that no\r\n\nvalid  consent  was  ever  given,  and  that  his  girlfriend's\r\n\n                              -3-\r\r\n\nsignature on  the form  had been coerced.   In  any event,  the\r\n\nofficers conducted a warrantless search of the apartment.  They\r\n\nseized  three  large  bags  containing over  $13,000  worth  of\r\n\ncocaine lying in a closet in one of  the bedrooms.  Back at the\r\n\npolice  station, Raposa was  informed of the  seizures.  Having\r\n\nbeen  read his Miranda rights, he agreed to talk, and confessed\r                                  \r\n\nthat the cocaine was his.\r\n\n       Raposa was  charged with  possession of  cocaine (375.21\r\n\ngrams)  and  heroin  (less  than   5  grams),  with  intent  to\r\n\ndistribute. After initially pleading not guilty to both counts,\r\n\nhe moved to  suppress all of  the cocaine  that the police  had\r\n\nfound  in his apartment,  arguing that it  was the fruit  of an\r\n\nillegal  search.   After an  evidentiary hearing,  the district\r\n\ncourt  granted  the motion,  finding  that  the government  had\r\n\nfailed to prove that  Raposa's girlfriend had consented to  the\r\n\nsearch.    The defendant  subsequently  pleaded  guilty to  the\r\n\nheroin  charge  (Count  II),  and  the  government  voluntarily\r\n\ndismissed the cocaine charge (Count I).\r\n\n                               II\r\n\n       Raposa's sentence for his heroin conviction was governed\r\n\nby U.S.S.G.    2D1.1.   Under  that  guideline, the  amount  of\r\n\nheroin  possessed   by  the  defendant  (less   than  5  grams)\r\n\ncorresponds  to  a base  offense  level of  12,  which, charted\r\n\nagainst  a  criminal  history  category of  I,  would  yield  a\r\n\nGuidelines  sentencing range  of  10-16 months.   However,  the\r\n\ndistrict court found, over  the defendant's objection, that the\r\n\n                              -4-\r\r\n\ndefendant's possession  of the  cocaine found at  his apartment\r\n\nconstituted  \"part of the same  course of conduct  . . . as the\r\n\noffense of conviction\" under the Guidelines' \"relevant conduct\"\r\n\nprovision.  U.S.S.G.   1B1.3(a)(2).\r\n\n       After expressing serious reservations about the fairness\r\n\nof considering  illegally seized  evidence for purposes  of the\r\n\nGuidelines'  relevant  conduct provisions,  the  district court\r\n\nconcluded,  relying  on cases  from  other  circuits, that  the\r\n\nexclusionary  rule did not apply at sentencing.  The court thus\r\n\nincorporated the cocaine into the total drug quantity for which\r\n\ndefendant  was to be sentenced, pushing the offense level up to\r\n\n22.     After  subtracting  three  levels   for  acceptance  of\r\n\nresponsibility,  the court arrived at  a total offense level of\r\n\n19, yielding a  final sentencing  range of 30-37  months.   The\r\n\ncourt  imposed a sentence of 30 months, and the defendant filed\r\n\nthis appeal.1\r\n\n                              III\r\n\n       To date,  five circuit  courts of appeal  have addressed\r\n\nthe  issue of  whether the  Fourth Amendment  exclusionary rule\r\n\nprohibits a sentencing court from  considering illegally seized\r\n\nevidence for purposes of determining or enhancing a defendant's\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  After acknowledging that defendant had raised a substantial\r\nissue for  appeal, the  district court granted  the defendant's\r\nrequest that he be permitted to remain released on bail pending\r\nappeal of the sentence.\r\n\n                              -5-\r\r\n\nGuidelines sentence.2  Each  of these courts has held  that the\r\n\nexclusionary rule  does not  generally apply in  the sentencing\r\n\ncontext  and  that  there  is  no  blanket  prohibition on  the\r\n\nconsideration of  illegally  seized evidence  for  purposes  of\r\n\nmaking the findings required under the Guidelines.

In  setting forth  his\r\n\nversion  of the facts for  inclusion in the  PSR, the defendant\r\n\n(through  his counsel) provided  the federal  probation officer\r\n\nwith  a signed statement in which  he voluntarily admitted that\r                                                                      \r\n\nhe  owned  the  cocaine that  was  found  in  his apartment  on\r\n\nFebruary  10, 1995.   The  statement was  incorporated verbatim\r\n\ninto the PSR.  It declared, in relevant part:\r\n\n       I understand the  police recovered two bundles of\r\n       heroin  near  my car  [on  February  10].   Those\r\n       bundles  of  heroin were  my  heroin.   I  accept\r\n       complete responsibility for  my actions.

Cf. United  States v. Patino, 862 F.2d 128,\r                                                            \r\n\n132-34 (7th Cir. 1988) (holding  second confession not to  have\r\n\nbeen obtained in violation of Fourth Amendment where sufficient\r\n\ntime had passed since illegal search and initial confession and\r\n\nwhere intervening circumstances were benign), cert. denied, 490\r                                                                      \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  It  appears, although  the  record is  not clear,  that the\r\nstatement given by Raposa to the police on February 10 was also\r\ncovered by the district court's suppression order.\r\n\n5.  The  defendant further  admitted,  elsewhere  in this  same\r\nstatement,  that the  quantity of cocaine  he possessed  was at\r\nleast  equal to  the amount  charged in the  indictment (375.21\r\ngrams).\r\n\n6.  Defendant's PSR statement was not made under any promise of\r\nimmunity.   Cf. United States  v.

He appeals that sentence, arguing that the district court erroneously included as \"relevant conduct,\" see U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3 (Nov. 1994), his possession, with intent to distribute, of a substantial quantity of cocaine that the court had earlier ordered suppressed as the product of an illegal search.   The consideration, inter alia, of the suppressed cocaine as \"relevant conduct\" increased the defendant's Guidelines sentencing range from 10-16 months to 30-37 months.   The latter was the same as the range that would have obtained if the defendant had been convicted on the cocaine count as well as the heroin count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are asked to decide whether the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule applies in the context of Sentencing Guidelines proceedings, at least on the facts of this case.   On the record before us, however, the resolution of that question is not necessary to the decision of this appeal.   We decline, therefore, to reach that important question here, preferring to leave it for a future case.   Instead, we affirm the defendant's sentence on the ground that the district court's findings were amply supported by statements concerning the cocaine provided by the defendant and incorporated in the Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSR\"), and on which he relied to obtain a reduction in his sentence for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* On February 10, 1995, two narcotics detectives interrupted a drug deal in progress in an alley in downtown Providence.   The defendant, Robert Raposa, was sitting in the driver's seat of a parked white Mercury Sable, doing business with several men standing at his window, when the detectives approached and identified themselves as police officers.   Raposa bolted out of the car and ran, dropping a bundle of heroin packets labelled \"Die Hard\" as he fled.   One of the officers picked up the heroin packets and gave chase.   Raposa was apprehended.   The officers brought him back to the scene of the drug deal, where they found another bundle of heroin marked \"Die Hard\" and $140 in cash on the ground near the Mercury.   Two beepers were found on the defendant, and a cellular telephone in the car.   Raposa was arrested and taken to the central police station.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a short investigation, the detectives went to Raposa's apartment, while the defendant remained in custody at the station.   A woman answered the door.   The officers told her that Raposa had been arrested.   The woman stated that Raposa was her boyfriend and lived with her in the apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What happened next was disputed.   The government would later assert that the woman consented to a search of the apartment, and that no search was undertaken until a consent form had been signed.   The defendant would contend that no valid consent was ever given, and that his girlfriend's signature on the form had been coerced.   In any event, the officers conducted a warrantless search of the apartment.   They seized three large bags containing over $13,000 worth of cocaine lying in a closet in one of the bedrooms.   Back at the police station, Raposa was informed of the seizures.   Having been read his Miranda rights, he agreed to talk, and confessed that the cocaine was his.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Raposa was charged with possession of cocaine (375.21 grams) and heroin (less than 5 grams), with intent to distribute.   After initially pleading not guilty to both counts, he moved to suppress all of the cocaine that the police had found in his apartment, arguing that it was the fruit of an illegal search.   After an evidentiary hearing, the district court granted the motion, finding that the government had failed to prove that Raposa's girlfriend had consented to the search.   The defendant subsequently pleaded guilty to the heroin charge (Count II), and the government voluntarily dismissed the cocaine charge (Count I).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Raposa's sentence for his heroin conviction was governed by U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1.  Under that guideline, the amount of heroin possessed by the defendant (less than 5 grams) corresponds to a base offense level of 12, which, charted against a criminal history category of I, would yield a Guidelines sentencing range of 10-16 months.   However, the district court found, over the defendant's objection, that the defendant's possession of the cocaine found at his apartment constituted \"part of the same course of conduct ... as the offense of conviction\" under the Guidelines' \"relevant conduct\" provision.   U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3(a)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After expressing serious reservations about the fairness of considering illegally seized evidence for purposes of the Guidelines' relevant conduct provisions, the district court concluded, relying on cases from other circuits, that the exclusionary rule did not apply at sentencing.   The court thus incorporated the cocaine into the total drug quantity for which defendant was to be sentenced, pushing the offense level up to 22.   After subtracting three levels for acceptance of responsibility, the court arrived at a total offense level of 19, yielding a final sentencing range of 30-37 months.   The court imposed a sentence of 30 months, and the defendant filed this appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To date, five circuit courts of appeal have addressed the issue of whether the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule prohibits a sentencing court from considering illegally seized evidence for purposes of determining or enhancing a defendant's Guidelines sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Each of these courts has held that the exclusionary rule does not generally apply in the sentencing context and that there is no blanket prohibition on the consideration of illegally seized evidence for purposes of making the findings required under the Guidelines.

He appeals that sentence, arguing that the district court erroneously included as \"relevant conduct,\" see U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3 (Nov. 1994), his possession, with intent to distribute, of a substantial quantity of cocaine that the court had earlier ordered suppressed as the product of an illegal search.   The consideration, inter alia, of the suppressed cocaine as \"relevant conduct\" increased the defendant's Guidelines sentencing range from 10-16 months to 30-37 months.   The latter was the same as the range that would have obtained if the defendant had been convicted on the cocaine count as well as the heroin count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are asked to decide whether the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule applies in the context of Sentencing Guidelines proceedings, at least on the facts of this case.   On the record before us, however, the resolution of that question is not necessary to the decision of this appeal.   We decline, therefore, to reach that important question here, preferring to leave it for a future case.   Instead, we affirm the defendant's sentence on the ground that the district court's findings were amply supported by statements concerning the cocaine provided by the defendant and incorporated in the Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSR\"), and on which he relied to obtain a reduction in his sentence for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* On February 10, 1995, two narcotics detectives interrupted a drug deal in progress in an alley in downtown Providence.   The defendant, Robert Raposa, was sitting in the driver's seat of a parked white Mercury Sable, doing business with several men standing at his window, when the detectives approached and identified themselves as police officers.   Raposa bolted out of the car and ran, dropping a bundle of heroin packets labelled \"Die Hard\" as he fled.   One of the officers picked up the heroin packets and gave chase.   Raposa was apprehended.   The officers brought him back to the scene of the drug deal, where they found another bundle of heroin marked \"Die Hard\" and $140 in cash on the ground near the Mercury.   Two beepers were found on the defendant, and a cellular telephone in the car.   Raposa was arrested and taken to the central police station.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a short investigation, the detectives went to Raposa's apartment, while the defendant remained in custody at the station.   A woman answered the door.   The officers told her that Raposa had been arrested.   The woman stated that Raposa was her boyfriend and lived with her in the apartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What happened next was disputed.   The government would later assert that the woman consented to a search of the apartment, and that no search was undertaken until a consent form had been signed.   The defendant would contend that no valid consent was ever given, and that his girlfriend's signature on the form had been coerced.   In any event, the officers conducted a warrantless search of the apartment.   They seized three large bags containing over $13,000 worth of cocaine lying in a closet in one of the bedrooms.   Back at the police station, Raposa was informed of the seizures.   Having been read his Miranda rights, he agreed to talk, and confessed that the cocaine was his.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Raposa was charged with possession of cocaine (375.21 grams) and heroin (less than 5 grams), with intent to distribute.   After initially pleading not guilty to both counts, he moved to suppress all of the cocaine that the police had found in his apartment, arguing that it was the fruit of an illegal search.   After an evidentiary hearing, the district court granted the motion, finding that the government had failed to prove that Raposa's girlfriend had consented to the search.   The defendant subsequently pleaded guilty to the heroin charge (Count II), and the government voluntarily dismissed the cocaine charge (Count I).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Raposa's sentence for his heroin conviction was governed by U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1.  Under that guideline, the amount of heroin possessed by the defendant (less than 5 grams) corresponds to a base offense level of 12, which, charted against a criminal history category of I, would yield a Guidelines sentencing range of 10-16 months.   However, the district court found, over the defendant's objection, that the defendant's possession of the cocaine found at his apartment constituted \"part of the same course of conduct ... as the offense of conviction\" under the Guidelines' \"relevant conduct\" provision.   U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3(a)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After expressing serious reservations about the fairness of considering illegally seized evidence for purposes of the Guidelines' relevant conduct provisions, the district court concluded, relying on cases from other circuits, that the exclusionary rule did not apply at sentencing.   The court thus incorporated the cocaine into the total drug quantity for which defendant was to be sentenced, pushing the offense level up to 22.   After subtracting three levels for acceptance of responsibility, the court arrived at a total offense level of 19, yielding a final sentencing range of 30-37 months.   The court imposed a sentence of 30 months, and the defendant filed this appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To date, five circuit courts of appeal have addressed the issue of whether the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule prohibits a sentencing court from considering illegally seized evidence for purposes of determining or enhancing a defendant's Guidelines sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Each of these courts has held that the exclusionary rule does not generally apply in the sentencing context and that there is no blanket prohibition on the consideration of illegally seized evidence for purposes of making the findings required under the Guidelines.

It declared, in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>I understand the police recovered two bundles of heroin near my car [on February 10].

The statement provided by defendant to the probation officer was voluntarily submitted, presumably with the advice of counsel.   Furthermore, the statement was provided after the district court had ruled on the defendant's suppression motion, so that defendant could make no claim that he was unaware of his rights.   The provision of the statement to the probation officer was \"sufficiently an act of free will to purge the primary taint\" of the illegal search.  Wong Sun v.
