Daniel R. Domnguez, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                        Before\r\n\n                Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n        Coffin and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\r\n\nMaritere Perez-Pascual with whom Peter John Porrata was on\r\nbrief for appellant.\r\nLeticia Casalduc Rabell, Assistant Solicitor General, with\r\nwhom Carlos Lugo-Fiol, Solicitor General, and Edda Serrano-Blasini,\r\nDeputy Solicitor General, were on brief for appellees.\r\n\nMarch 30, 1999\r\n\nPer Curiam.  We affirm the judgment below, mainly on the\r\ndistrict court's opinion of May 20, 1998, denying plaintiff's\r\nmotion for reconsideration.  We deem it appropriate to make a few\r\nadditional comments.\r\nPreliminarily we observe that the present appeal is not from\r\nthe original judgment supported by the district court's opinion\r\ndated November 26, 1997, which was erroneously reproduced as an\r\naddendum to plaintiff's brief.  Rather, the appeal is from the\r\ndenial of the motion for reconsideration, and, consequently, we\r\nreview for abuse of discretion.\r\nAfter the district court's first opinion, barring litigation\r\nof plaintiff's  1983 claim on res judicata grounds, plaintiff\r\nmoved to reconsider, making two points.  The first was that the\r\nparties in the two suits were not identical, the first action being\r\nbrought in plaintiff's personal capacity and the second in his\r\nrepresentative capacity.  This contention is squarely and fully\r\ndealt with in the district court's opinion.\r\nThe second basis for reconsideration was the simple assertion\r\nthat plaintiff's action was not time barred because under Puerto\r\nRico law the prescriptive term of a minor is interrupted during his\r\nminority.  This assertion is puzzling because a statute of\r\nlimitations defense was not in issue.\r\nOnly on appeal do we find the argument that, under Puerto Rico\r\nlaw, there is a public policy exception to res judicata application\r\nto judgments which are adverse to minors, citing Perez v. Bauza, 83\r\nD.P.R. 220 (1961).\r\nThis prompts us to say the following:  (1) the argument, not\r\nhaving been presented to the district court, cannot be considered\r\non appeal; (2) occasionally the preclusive effect of a prior\r\nfederal court judgment can be avoided upon a showing of \"unusual\r\nhardship,\" Kale v. Combined Ins. Co. of America, 924 F.2d 1161,\r\n1168 (1st Cir. 1991); and (3) we see neither error of law nor abuse\r\nof discretion in a failure to discern \"unusual hardship,\" even if\r\nthe point had been raised.\r\nFinally, we are not unsympathetic to the plight of this minor\r\nplaintiff, who may have lost a viable cause of action.  But the\r\nanswer is not to expand the sweep of Perez v. Bauza, which held\r\nthat there is no preclusive effect of a prior judgment adverse to\r\na minor in a filiation action against a putative father, since that\r\ncourt was concerned about a minor's losing the opportunity to erase\r\nthe stigma of illegitimacy through the negligence of his mother. \r\nTo leap from this to an across-the-board exclusion from finality\r\nprinciples for any judgment adversely affecting a minor would be a\r\ndazzling encroachment on the legislative function.  Of course, in\r\ncases where preclusion may be attributed to the fault of counsel,\r\na minor is not left without remedy.\r\nAppellees' request for sanctions under Fed. R. App. P. 38 is\r\ndenied.\r\nAffirmed.\n",
