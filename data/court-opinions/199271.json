LARRABEE,\n\n                     Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n               FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n        [Hon. Douglas P. Woodlock, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                     Torruella, Chief Judge,\n                 Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                   and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     John D. Donovan, Jr., with whom Jennifer A. Drohan and Ropes\n& Gray were on brief, for appellant.\n\n     Diane C. Freniere, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\f                           February 14, 2001\n\n\n              BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.         The defendant, John C.\n\nLarrabee, was convicted of securities fraud after a jury trial\n\nand sentenced to twenty-one months imprisonment, followed by\n\nsupervised release for a term of two years.             He was also fined\n\n$20,000.      On appeal, the defendant argues that his conviction\n\nshould be reversed and his sentence vacated because the evidence\n\nwas insufficient as a matter of law.                 Finding the evidence\n\nsufficient to support the conviction, we affirm the district\n\ncourt.\n\n                                    I.\n\n              We describe the facts briefly here, but delve into them\n\nin greater detail where necessary for our discussion.             Larrabee\n\nwas employed as Director of Fiduciary Services by the Boston law\n\nfirm of Bingham Dana & Gould (“Bingham Dana”).               Larrabee, as\n\nDirector of Fiduciary Services, controlled the selection of\n\nstockbrokers for the placing of securities trades on behalf of\n\nthe   trust    accounts   managed   by    Bingham    Dana.   D'Angelo   was\n\nemployed as a stockbroker by PaineWebber, Inc. and Larrabee\n\ndirected a large share of Bingham Dana's business to D'Angelo.\n\nD'Angelo and Larrabee also shared a personal and financial\n\nrelationship.\n\n                                    -2-\n\f          From almost December 7, 1995 until December 12, 1995,\n\nBingham Dana represented Bank of Boston in connection with a\n\npotential merger with BayBanks.           This was a highly confidential\n\ntransaction.    Though few attorneys at Bingham Dana were involved\n\nin the transaction, Larrabee had daily contact with at least\n\none, John Brown.    Brown visited Larrabee's office frequently to\n\ncheck   stock   prices    and   monitor     Brown's   personal    account.\n\nComputer records indicate that Larrabee opened Brown's account\n\nsummary on Larrabee's computer at 3:27 p.m. and 3:28 p.m. on\n\nDecember 12, 1995.\n\n          At 3:29 p.m., one minute after opening Brown's account\n\nsummary, Larrabee placed a call to D'Angelo.            The call lasted\n\none minute and twelve seconds.             Immediately after Larrabee's\n\ncall, D'Angelo called his trading assistant, Krista Floramo, and\n\nentered   orders   to    purchase   approximately     11,000     shares   of\n\nBayBanks stock, priced at $85 per share, for his own account and\n\nthose of other family members and his girlfriend.                 When the\n\ntrades were slow to be executed, he instructed Floramo to call\n\na PaineWebber trader in New York to urge prompt execution.\n\nD'Angelo remained on the line until the trades were executed\n\njust prior to the market close at 4:00 p.m.             This particular\n\npurchase and trading pattern was unusual for D'Angelo.                This\n\npurchase was nearly twice as large as his previous trades.\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fMoreover, Floramo purchased 400 shares of BayBanks stock for her\n\nown account because of the unusual pattern of trades.              To her\n\nknowledge, D'Angelo never had bought across all of his family\n\naccounts at once.\n\n            After the market closed on December 12, 1995, Bank of\n\nBoston and BayBanks announced their merger.            As a result of the\n\nmerger, BayBanks stock price increased by $8 per share before\n\nthe market opened on December 13, 1995.                Before the market\n\nopened on December 13, D'Angelo placed orders to sell all the\n\nshares he purchased the previous evening.             D'Angelo realized a\n\nprofit for those accounts of approximately $86,750.\n\n            PaineWebber attorneys questioned both D'Angelo and\n\nFloramo about those trades.         D'Angelo attempted to speak with\n\nFloramo about her interview and unsuccessfully attempted to\n\ncontact Larrabee.      Larrabee and D'Angelo eventually spoke for\n\napproximately eight minutes on the morning of December 14, 1995.\n\nPaineWebber officials contacted a Bingham Dana attorney, Gerald\n\nRath, to inform him of their suspicions and that Larrabee's name\n\nwould likely surface in an SEC investigation.                Bingham Dana\n\nattorneys    then   spoke   with   Larrabee   about    his   contact   with\n\nD'Angelo.\n\n            On June 30, 1998, a federal grand jury returned a nine-\n\ncount indictment against co-defendants, John C. Larrabee and\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fJames   L.   D'Angelo,    charging     each   with    securities     fraud   in\n\nviolation     of   15   U.S.C.   §§   78j(b),      78ff(a)   and   aiding    and\n\nabetting in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2.                The defendants were\n\ntried separately and both were found guilty on all counts.                  Both\n\nfiled notices to appeal, but D'Angelo has since withdrawn his\n\nappeal.\n\n             Larrabee seeks to reverse his conviction, arguing that\n\n“[t]he evidence was not sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt     that      Larrabee     'appropriated'        material     nonpublic\n\ninformation      such   that   he   could   have    'misappropriated'       that\n\ninformation.”       (italics in original).          He further argues that\n\n“[t]he evidence was not sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt     that     Larrabee    'misappropriated'       material     nonpublic\n\ninformation for 'use' in 'connection with the purchase or sale\n\nof a security.”\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f                                       II.\n\n            At   the    conclusion     of    the     government's   case,      the\n\ndefendant moved for judgment of acquittal pursuant to Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 29(a).         The defendant failed, however, to renew his\n\nmotion at the close of his case, as is required.                    See United\n\nStates v. Concemi, 957 F.2d 942, 950 (1st Cir. 1992) (when the\n\ndefendant    does      not   renew   its    motion    for   acquittal,    it    is\n\nconsidered waived).          The jury returned a verdict against the\n\ndefendant; the defendant now challenges the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence.    Because the defendant failed to renew his challenge\n\nafter the close of the evidence, we review his challenge on\n\nappeal for clear and gross injustice.                United States v. Stein,\n\n233 F.3d 6, 20 (1st Cir. 2000); United States v. Santiago, 83\n\nF.3d 20, 23 (1st Cir. 1996); Concemi 957 F.2d at 950.                    Even if\n\nthe challenge were adequately presented, the evidence is more\n\nthan sufficient to rationally support the verdict.\n\n            On appeal, we must determine whether the evidence,\n\n            taken in the light most favorable to the\n            government--a perspective that requires us\n            to draw every reasonable inference and to\n            resolve credibility conflicts in a manner\n            consistent with the verdict--would permit a\n            rational trier of fact to find each element\n            of the crimes charged beyond a reasonable\n            doubt.\n\nUnited States v.        Santana, 175 F.3d 57, 62 (1st Cir. 1999);\n\nSantiago, 83 F.3d at 23.             This burden can be met by “either\n\n                                       -6-\n\fdirect    or     circumstantial     evidence,    or   by     any   combination\n\nthereof.”        Santiago, 83 F.3d at 23; see also United States v.\n\nSargent, 229 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir. 2000) (“[A] plaintiff is not\n\nrequired to produce direct evidence:            circumstantial evidence .\n\n. . is just as appropriate as direct evidence and is entitled to\n\nbe given whatever weight the jury deems it should be given under\n\nthe circumstances within which it unfolds.”) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted); United States v. Valerio, 48 F.3d 58, 63 (1st\n\nCir.     1995)    (“[P]roof   may    lay   entirely     in    circumstantial\n\nevidence.”).\n\n            The      government      brought     this      case     under    a\n\nmisappropriation theory of insider trading.                See United States\n\nv.   O'Hagan, 521 U.S. 642 (1997).              Under a misappropriation\n\ntheory,\n\n            a person commits a fraud “in connection\n            with” a securities transaction, and thereby\n            violates § 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, when he\n            misappropriates confidential information for\n            securities trading purposes, in breach of a\n            duty owed to the source of the information.\n            Under    this    theory,     a     fiduciary's\n            undisclosed,    self-serving     use    of   a\n            principal's information to purchase or sell\n            securities, in breach of a duty of loyalty\n            and confidentiality, defrauds the principal\n            of the exclusive use of the information. . .\n            .   [T]he misappropriation theory outlaws\n            trading   on   the    basis    of    nonpublic\n            information by a corporate “outsider” in\n            breach of a duty owed not to a trading\n            party, but to the source of the information.\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fId. at 652-53 (internal citation omitted).                      This can be, and\n\noften   is,     proven       by   circumstantial         evidence.      See,    e.g.,\n\nSargent, 229 F.3d at 74-75.               After careful review of the entire\n\nrecord, we find that the evidence was sufficient for a jury to\n\nconclude      beyond    a    reasonable     doubt     that     Larrabee   possessed\n\nmaterial, nonpublic information concerning a merger between Bank\n\nof Boston and BayBanks and that he conveyed that information to\n\nD'Angelo, a stockbroker, with whom he had a close personal and\n\nfinancial relationship.\n\n              The defendant argues that proof of “opportunity” or\n\n“access” to material, nonpublic information is not the same as\n\nproving actual possession.              That is correct, but does not carry\n\nthe day.      While the defendant is correct that opportunity alone\n\ndoes    not    constitute         proof    of    possession,      opportunity      in\n\ncombination with circumstantial evidence of a well-timed and\n\nwell-orchestrated            sequence      of     events,      culminating      with\n\nsuccessful      stock       trades,    creates    a   compelling       inference   of\n\npossession by the tipper.              See, e.g., SEC v. Warde, 151 F.3d 42,\n\n46-49 (2d Cir. 1998); SEC v. Singer, 786 F. Supp. 1158, 1164\n\n(S.D.N.Y.      1992);    SEC      v.   Musella,    578    F.   Supp.    425,   440-41\n\n(S.D.N.Y. 1984).\n\n              After reviewing the record, and “resolving all doubts\n\nand credibility issues in favor of the [government],” Sargent,\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\f229 F.3d at 75, we find that there was compelling evidence for\n\na jury to determine that Larrabee possessed material, nonpublic\n\ninformation.       We examine myriad factors, including (1) access to\n\ninformation; (2) relationship between the tipper and the tippee;\n\n(3) timing of contact between the tipper and the tippee; (4)\n\ntiming   of    the    trades;   (5)    pattern   of    the   trades;   and   (6)\n\nattempts      to   conceal   either    the    trades   or    the   relationship\n\nbetween the tipper and the tippee.\n\n              The evidence presented at trial, when pieced together,\n\npainted a picture which allowed the jury to conclude beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that Larrabee possessed material, nonpublic\n\ninformation about the Bank of Boston-BayBanks merger.                  Larrabee\n\nhad the opportunity to access the information.                See Sargent, 229\n\nF.3d at 76 (tipper had access to the information because he\n\nshared   a    small    office   with   the    source   of    the   confidential\n\ninformation).        Larrabee was the Director of Fiduciary Services\n\nat Bingham Dana.         Beginning on December 7, 1995, Bingham Dana\n\nrepresented Bank of Boston in connection with a potential merger\n\nwith BayBanks.        This was a highly confidential transaction, with\n\nonly eight attorneys involved.               Two of those eight attorneys,\n\nJohn Brown and Donald Abrams, worked on the seventeenth floor,\n\nas did Larrabee.         Copies of documents pertaining to the bank\n\nmerger were left in their “IN” boxes, located in the main\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fhallway of the floor and copies were made in the copying room\n\nlocated across from Larrabee's office.                    The names of the banks\n\ninvolved in the merger were often substituted with code names,\n\nbut eventually documents were circulated with the correct party\n\nnames.\n\n              Larrabee had daily contact with John Brown.                        Brown\n\nvisited Larrabee's office frequently to check stock prices and\n\nmonitor Brown's personal account.                    Computer records indicate\n\nthat    Larrabee      opened   Brown's       account      summary     on    Larrabee's\n\ncomputer at 3:27 p.m. and 3:28 p.m. on December 12, 1995.                        Brown\n\ntestified that he did not recall telling Larrabee about the bank\n\nmerger,      but    admitted   that     he    could      not   “say   with    absolute\n\ncertainty      that    [he]    didn't    say       something    inadvertently”      to\n\nLarrabee.\n\n              While Larrabee's access to the information is not\n\nenough to prove that he actually possessed it, when we look\n\nfurther,      the    inferences    taken       as    a   whole,   are      compelling.\n\nFirst, we note the relationship between Larrabee and D'Angelo.\n\nSee Warde, 151 F.3d at 45, 48-49 (tipper and tippee had close\n\npersonal friendship); Musella, 578 F. Supp. at 441 (tipper and\n\ntippee were close personal friends).                      Larrabee and D'Angelo\n\nshare    a   personal,    financial          and    professional      relationship.\n\nLarrabee and D'Angelo had been friends for a long time and their\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\ffamilies had spent various weekends, holidays and vacations\n\ntogether.     For example, the two families celebrated many New\n\nYear's     Eves   together,    including     the    year    prior   to   this\n\ntransaction.        The   Larrabees    had   an     “open   invitation”    to\n\nD'Angelo's vacation home and visited it both with D'Angelo and\n\nwithout him.\n\n            The two men also shared a financial relationship.\n\nThere is evidence in the record that D'Angelo made various\n\npayments    to    Larrabee    either   directly     or   indirectly.      For\n\nexample, D'Angelo gave the Larrabee children monetary Christmas\n\npresents.    The record indicates that D'Angelo made some college\n\ntuition payments for Larrabee's children and wrote a check for\n\n$1,600 payable to Larrabee's Fidelity Investments account.                The\n\ntwo college tuition payments for Larrabee's son totaled almost\n\n$23,500, and were made by bank check.              A payment of $4,403 was\n\nmade for the daughter's tuition.        Larrabee did not disclose this\n\nfinancial relationship, in violation of Bingham Dana's conflict\n\nof interest policy.\n\n            Their relationship also had a professional component.\n\nLarrabee, as Director of Fiduciary Services, controlled the\n\nselection of stockbrokers for the placing of securities trades\n\non behalf of the trust accounts managed by Bingham Dana.                  The\n\nevidence shows that Larrabee directed a large share of Bingham\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fDana's business to D'Angelo.       In fact, Larrabee estimated that\n\nhe   gave   seventy-five   to   eighty   percent   of   Bingham   Dana's\n\nbusiness to D'Angelo.       Bingham Dana was D'Angelo's largest\n\nclient.\n\n            The timing of the events is also significant.            See\n\nWarde, 151 F.3d at 47-48 (timing of purchases coincided with\n\ncontact between tipper and tippee); Adler, 137 F.3d 1325, 1340\n\n(11th Cir. 1998) (suspicious timing of phone calls and trades);\n\ncf. SEC v. Truong, 98 F. Supp. 2d 1086, 1097-99 (holding that\n\nthere was no insider trading when, inter alia, trading did not\n\noccur immediately after the calls, but throughout the following\n\nweek); see also Musella, 578 F. Supp. at 441 (timing of trades\n\nsignificant).    Here, the evidence shows that Larrabee opened the\n\naccount summary of John Brown at 3:27 p.m. and 3:28 p.m. on\n\nDecember 12, 1995.     One minute later, at 3:29 p.m., Larrabee\n\ncalled D'Angelo.    The call lasted one minute and twelve seconds.\n\nImmediately thereafter, D'Angelo called his trading assistant,\n\nKrista Floramo.     They spoke for fourteen minutes and D'Angelo\n\nplaced an order for approximately 11,000 shares of BayBanks\n\nstock.\n\n            The pattern of the stock purchase is another piece in\n\nthe puzzle.     See Sargent, 229 F.3d at 73 (largest investment of\n\nthe year); Warde, 151 F.3d at 48 (“uncharacteristic, substantial\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\fand exceedingly risky investments” suggested insider trading);\n\nMusella,   578    F.    Supp.     at    441       (unusual     trade     pattern).\n\nImmediately after Larrabee called D'Angelo on December 12, 1995,\n\nD'Angelo called his trading assistant, Floramo, and entered\n\norders to purchase approximately 11,000 shares of BankBanks\n\nstock, priced at $85 per share, for his own account and those of\n\nother family members and his girlfriend.                      D'Angelo purchased\n\napproximately $870,048 worth of BayBanks stock.                    This purchase\n\nwas   nearly   twice    as   large     as   any    of   his    previous    trades.\n\nImmediately after talking with D'Angelo, Floramo called her\n\nhusband and then purchased 400 shares of BayBanks stock for her\n\npersonal account.\n\n           When   the    trades      were     slow      to    execute,    D'Angelo\n\ninstructed Floramo to call a PaineWebber trader in New York to\n\nurge prompt execution.          Floramo testified that she did not\n\nrecall any other time, in all the years that she worked for him,\n\nwhen D'Angelo asked her to do this.                 D'Angelo remained on the\n\nline until the trades were executed just prior to the close of\n\nthe market at 4:00 p.m.         Floramo testified that this trade was\n\nunusual for D'Angelo: i.e., the amount of shares and the fact\n\nthat they were purchased for his family accounts.\n\n           After the market closed on December 12, 1995, BayBanks\n\nand Bank of Boston announced their merger.                      BayBanks' stock\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fwould be converted into shares of Bank of Boston.           As a result,\n\nBayBanks stock price increased $8 per share before the market\n\nopened on December 13, 1995.             Before the market opened on\n\nDecember 13th, D'Angelo placed orders to sell all of the shares\n\nhe purchased the previous evening.           D'Angelo, his family and\n\ngirlfriend realized a profit for those accounts of approximately\n\n$86,750.\n\n            We also find significant the efforts of D'Angelo and\n\nLarrabee to conceal their relationship and the purchases made by\n\nD'Angelo.    See Warde, 151 F.3d at 47 (“[Defendant's] resort to\n\ndeceptive trading practices supports an inference that he was\n\ntrading illegally on insider information.”).               The afternoon\n\nafter Bank of Boston and BayBanks announced their merger, Eric\n\nSelzer, managing attorney at PaineWebber, contacted D'Angelo to\n\ninquire why D'Angelo purchased BayBanks stock the previous day.\n\nThey spoke for approximately thirty minutes.               D'Angelo then\n\ninformed Floramo that he had been questioned by PaineWebber\n\nattorneys and that she might be questioned as well.          Thereafter,\n\nthe PaineWebber attorney called Floramo to discuss D'Angelo's\n\ntrading of BayBanks stock.        The call lasted from five to ten\n\nminutes.\n\n            After work, Floramo contacted her own attorney.           That\n\nevening,    Floramo   arrived   home   to   find   three   messages   from\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\fD'Angelo.    Floramo returned his call.                 D'Angelo asked her about\n\nher   conversation      with      the     PaineWebber        attorney,         but     she\n\nresponded    that    she    could    not    speak       to   him    on   the    matter.\n\nD'Angelo asked her to meet him for coffee the following morning\n\nat the Mobil Mart next to the office.                He had never asked her to\n\ndo this before.      She agreed, but instead went directly to work.\n\n            D'Angelo attempted to contact Larrabee at home during\n\nthe   evening   of   December       14.         Phone    records      indicate        that\n\nLarrabee called D'Angelo at work on the morning of December 14\n\nand the two spoke for approximately eight minutes.                             D'Angelo\n\ncalled Larrabee again that evening at home at approximately\n\n9:00-9:30 p.m.       Larrabee told D'Angelo that he could not talk\n\nand hung up.\n\n            The PaineWebber attorney contacted D'Angelo again in\n\nthe morning on December 14.               The attorney then called Gerald\n\nRath, a partner at Bingham Dana, to give him “a heads up.”                             The\n\nPaineWebber     attorney     informed       Rath    that     Bingham      Dana       would\n\nlikely   receive     other       calls    regarding       the      D'Angelo     trades,\n\nparticularly     from      the   SEC.      The     PaineWebber        attorney       then\n\ndescribed his suspicions about D'Angelo and Larrabee.\n\n            Later that afternoon, Rath and Bingham Dana managing\n\npartner, Jay Zimmerman, met with Larrabee.                   When asked about his\n\nrelationship     with   D'Angelo,         Larrabee      told    them     about       their\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\fprofessional relationship.           Rath testified that he was made to\n\nbelieve that Larrabee and D'Angelo were not close friends but\n\nthey shared “an occasional social relationship.”                   Rath directly\n\nasked Larrabee about any financial relationship--whether there\n\nwere any checks or money back and forth.                    Larrabee responded\n\nthat there was nothing of value with the exception of one $100\n\nChristmas gift from D'Angelo to Larrabee's children.                    Larrabee\n\ndid not mention any of the other payments made by D'Angelo.\n\nRath also questioned Larrabee about recent contact that he had\n\nwith D'Angelo.      Rath directly asked Larrabee when the last time\n\nhe spoke with D'Angelo.         Larrabee responded that it was sometime\n\nearlier in the week.          In reality, it was earlier that morning.\n\n\n\n            We find that there was compelling evidence for a jury\n\nto   determine      that   Larrabee       possessed     material,      nonpublic\n\ninformation:       Larrabee's       access    to     the     information;      the\n\nrelationship between Larrabee and D'Angelo; the timing of the\n\ncontacts between Larrabee, D'Angelo and the trades; the pattern\n\nof the trades; and the attempts by Larrabee and D'Angelo to\n\nconceal the trades and their relationship with each other.                   When\n\nassembled,    the    pieces    of   the    puzzle    create    a   picture   that\n\nsupports    the    inference    that      Larrabee    did    possess   material,\n\nnonpublic         information        about      the         bank     merger.\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\f          The defendant also argues that “the evidence of Mr.\n\nLarrabee's   'use'    of     any   'appropriated'       information   was\n\ninsufficient to establish 'misappropriation' beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.”   (Italics in original).        The defendant contends that the\n\nevidence was insufficient for the jury to infer that Larrabee's\n\ntip to D'Angelo was intended for use in connection with the\n\npurchase or sale of a security.           The second requirement of an\n\ninsider   trading    violation     is     that   “the   misappropriator's\n\ndeceptive use of information be in connection with the purchase\n\nand sale of [a] security.”              O'Hagan, 521 U.S. 642, 655-56\n\n(alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n          Larrabee argues that even assuming arguendo that he did\n\npossess the material, nonpublic information, the evidence is\n\ninsufficient for a jury to infer that he gave that information\n\nto D'Angelo with the intent that D'Angelo use that information\n\nto   purchase   or    sell    securities.          We   disagree.     The\n\ncircumstantial evidence detailed above more than adequately\n\nsupports the conclusion that Larrabee intended that D'Angelo use\n\nthe information for purchase or sale of the security.\n\n          The tipper's knowledge that he or she was\n          breaching   a   duty   to  the   owner   of\n          confidential   information    suffices   to\n          establish the tipper's expectation that the\n          breach will lead to some kind of misuse of\n          the information. This is so because it may\n          be presumed that the tippee's interest in\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\f         the information is, in contemporary jargon,\n         not for nothing.\n\nSargent, 229 F.3d at 77 (quoting United States v.

Larrabee, was convicted of securities fraud after a jury trial and sentenced to twenty-one months imprisonment, followed by supervised release for a term of two years. He was also fined $20,000. On appeal, the defendant argues that his conviction should be reversed and his sentence vacated because the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law. Finding the evidence sufficient to support the conviction, we affirm the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We describe the facts briefly here, but delve into them in greater detail where necessary for our discussion. Larrabee was employed as Director of Fiduciary Services by the Boston law firm of Bingham Dana &amp; Gould (\"Bingham Dana\"). Larrabee, as Director of Fiduciary Services, controlled the selection of stockbrokers for the placing of securities trades on behalf of the trust accounts managed by Bingham Dana. D'Angelo was employed as a stockbroker by PaineWebber, Inc. and Larrabee directed a large share of Bingham Dana's business to D'Angelo. D'Angelo and Larrabee also shared a personal and financial relationship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From almost December 7, 1995 until December 12, 1995, Bingham Dana represented Bank of Boston in connection with a potential merger with BayBanks. This was a highly confidential transaction. Though few attorneys at Bingham Dana were involved in the transaction, Larrabee had daily contact with at least one, John Brown. Brown visited Larrabee's office frequently to check stock prices and monitor Brown's personal account. Computer records indicate that Larrabee opened Brown's account summary on Larrabee's computer at 3:27 p.m. and 3:28 p.m. on December 12, 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At 3:29 p.m., one minute after opening Brown's account summary, Larrabee placed a call to D'Angelo. The call lasted one minute and twelve seconds. Immediately after Larrabee's call, D'Angelo called his trading assistant, Krista Floramo, and entered orders to purchase approximately 11,000 shares of BayBanks stock, priced at $85 per share, for his own account and those of other family members and his girlfriend. When the trades were slow to be executed, he instructed Floramo to call a PaineWebber trader in New York to urge prompt execution. D'Angelo remained on the line until the trades were executed just prior to the market close at 4:00 p.m. This particular purchase and trading pattern was unusual for D'Angelo. This purchase was nearly twice as large as his previous trades. Moreover, Floramo purchased 400 shares of BayBanks stock for her own account because of the unusual pattern of trades. To her knowledge, D'Angelo never had bought across all of his family accounts at once.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the market closed on December 12, 1995, Bank of Boston and BayBanks announced their merger. As a result of the merger, BayBanks stock price increased by $8 per share before the market opened on December 13, 1995. Before the market opened on December 13, D'Angelo placed orders to sell all the shares he purchased the previous evening. D'Angelo realized a profit for those accounts of approximately $86,750.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PaineWebber attorneys questioned both D'Angelo and Floramo about those trades. D'Angelo attempted to speak with Floramo about her interview and unsuccessfully attempted to contact Larrabee. Larrabee and D'Angelo eventually spoke for approximately eight minutes on the morning of December 14, 1995. PaineWebber officials contacted a Bingham Dana attorney, Gerald Rath, to inform him of their suspicions and that Larrabee's name would likely surface in an SEC investigation. Bingham Dana attorneys then spoke with Larrabee about his contact with D'Angelo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 30, 1998, a federal grand jury returned a nine-count indictment against co-defendants, John C. Larrabee and James L. D'Angelo, charging each with securities fraud in violation of 15aU.S.C. &#167;&#167; 78j(b), 78ff(a) and aiding and abetting in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2. The defendants were tried separately and both were found guilty on all counts. Both filed notices to appeal, but D'Angelo has since withdrawn his appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Larrabee seeks to reverse his conviction, arguing that \"[t]he evidence was not sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Larrabee 'appropriated' material nonpublic information such that he could have 'misappropriated' that information.\" (italics in original). He further argues that \"[t]he evidence was not sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Larrabee 'misappropriated' material nonpublic information for 'use' in 'connection with the purchase or sale of a security.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the conclusion of the government's case, the defendant moved for judgment of acquittal pursuant to Fed.

Concemi, 957 F.2d 942, 950 (1st Cir. 1992) (when the defendant does not renew its motion for acquittal, it is considered waived). The jury returned a verdict against the defendant; the defendant now challenges the sufficiency of the evidence. Because the defendant failed to renew his challenge after the close of the evidence, we review his challenge on appeal for clear and gross injustice. United States v.aStein, 233 F.3d 6, 20 (1st Cir. 2000); United States v. Santiago, 83 F.3d 20, 23 (1st Cir. 1996); Concemi 957 F.2d at 950.

Sargent, 229 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"[A] plaintiff is not required to produce direct evidence: circumstantial evidence . . . is just as appropriate as direct evidence and is entitled to be given whatever weight the jury deems it should be given under the circumstances within which it unfolds.\") (internal quotation marks omitted); United States v.

Under a misappropriation theory,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a person commits a fraud \"in connection with\" a securities transaction, and thereby violates &#167; 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, when he misappropriates confidential information for securities trading purposes, in breach of a duty owed to the source of the information. Under this theory, a fiduciary's undisclosed, self-serving use of a principal's information to purchase or sell securities, in breach of a duty of loyalty and confidentiality, defrauds the principal of the exclusive use of the information. . . . [T]he misappropriation theory outlaws trading on the basis of nonpublic information by a corporate \"outsider\" in breach of a duty owed not to a trading party, but to the source of the information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 652-53 (internal citation omitted). This can be, and often is, proven by circumstantial evidence. See, e.g., Sargent, 229 F.3d at 74-75. After careful review of the entire record, we find that the evidence was sufficient for a jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Larrabee possessed material, nonpublic information concerning a merger between Bank of Boston and BayBanks and that he conveyed that information to D'Angelo, a stockbroker, with whom he had a close personal and financial relationship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant argues that proof of \"opportunity\" or \"access\" to material, nonpublic information is not the same as proving actual possession. That is correct, but does not carry the day. While the defendant is correct that opportunity alone does not constitute proof of possession, opportunity in combination with circumstantial evidence of a well-timed and well-orchestrated sequence of events, culminating with successful stock trades, creates a compelling inference of possession by the tipper. See, e.g., SEC v. Warde, 151 F.3d 42, 46-49 (2d Cir. 1998); SECav. Singer, 786 F. Supp. 1158, 1164 (S.D.N.Y. 1992); SEC v. Musella, 578 F. Supp. 425, 440-41 (S.D.N.Y. 1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing the record, and \"resolving all doubts and credibility issues in favor of the [government],\" Sargent, 229 F.3d at 75, we find that there was compelling evidence for a jury to determine that Larrabee possessed material, nonpublic information. We examine myriad factors, including (1) access to information; (2) relationship between the tipper and the tippee; (3) timing of contact between the tipper and the tippee; (4) timing of the trades; (5) pattern of the trades; and (6) attempts to conceal either the trades or the relationship between the tipper and the tippee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence presented at trial, when pieced together, painted a picture which allowed the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Larrabee possessed material, nonpublic information about the Bank of Boston-BayBanks merger. Larrabee had the opportunity to access the information. See Sargent, 229 F.3d at 76 (tipper had access to the information because he shared a small office with the source of the confidential information). Larrabee was the Director of Fiduciary Services at Bingham Dana. Beginning on December 7, 1995, Bingham Dana represented Bank of Boston in connection with a potential merger with BayBanks. This was a highly confidential transaction, with only eight attorneys involved. Two of those eight attorneys, John Brown and Donald Abrams, worked on the seventeenth floor, as did Larrabee. Copies of documents pertaining to the bank merger were left in their \"IN\" boxes, located in the main hallway of the floor and copies were made in the copying room located across from Larrabee's office. The names of the banks involved in the merger were often substituted with code names, but eventually documents were circulated with the correct party names.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Larrabee had daily contact with John Brown. Brown visited Larrabee's office frequently to check stock prices and monitor Brown's personal account. Computer records indicate that Larrabee opened Brown's account summary on Larrabee's computer at 3:27 p.m. and 3:28 p.m. on December 12, 1995. Brown testified that he did not recall telling Larrabee about the bank merger, but admitted that he could not \"say with absolute certainty that [he] didn't say something inadvertently\" to Larrabee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Larrabee's access to the information is not enough to prove that he actually possessed it, when we look further, the inferences taken as a whole, are compelling. First, we note the relationship between Larrabee and D'Angelo. See Warde, 151 F.3d at 45, 48-49 (tipper and tippee had close personal friendship); Musella, 578 F. Supp. at 441 (tipper and tippee were close personal friends). Larrabee and D'Angelo share a personal, financial and professional relationship. Larrabee and D'Angelo had been friends for a long time and their families had spent various weekends, holidays and vacations together. For example, the two families celebrated many New Year's Eves together, including the year prior to this transaction. The Larrabees had an \"open invitation\" to D'Angelo's vacation home and visited it both with D'Angelo and without him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two men also shared a financial relationship. There is evidence in the record that D'Angelo made various payments to Larrabee either directly or indirectly. For example, D'Angelo gave the Larrabee children monetary Christmas presents. The record indicates that D'Angelo made some college tuition payments for Larrabee's children and wrote a check for $1,600 payable to Larrabee's Fidelity Investments account. The two college tuition payments for Larrabee's son totaled almost $23,500, and were made by bank check. A payment of $4,403 was made for the daughter's tuition. Larrabee did not disclose this financial relationship, in violation of Bingham Dana's conflict of interest policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Their relationship also had a professional component. Larrabee, as Director of Fiduciary Services, controlled the selection of stockbrokers for the placing of securities trades on behalf of the trust accounts managed by Bingham Dana. The evidence shows that Larrabee directed a large share of Bingham Dana's business to D'Angelo. In fact, Larrabee estimated that he gave seventy-five to eighty percent of Bingham Dana's business to D'Angelo. Bingham Dana was D'Angelo's largest client.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The timing of the events is also significant. SeeWarde, 151 F.3d at 47-48 (timing of purchases coincided with contact between tipper and tippee); Adler, 137 F.3d 1325, 1340 (11th Cir. 1998) (suspicious timing of phone calls and trades); cf. SEC v. Truong, 98 F. Supp. 2d 1086, 1097-99 (holding that there was no insider trading when, inter alia, trading did not occur immediately after the calls, but throughout the following week); see also Musella, 578 F. Supp. at 441 (timing of trades significant). Here, the evidence shows that Larrabee opened the account summary of John Brown at 3:27 p.m. and 3:28 p.m. on December 12, 1995. One minute later, at 3:29 p.m., Larrabee called D'Angelo. The call lasted one minute and twelve seconds. Immediately thereafter, D'Angelo called his trading assistant, Krista Floramo. They spoke for fourteen minutes and D'Angelo placed an order for approximately 11,000 shares of BayBanks stock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pattern of the stock purchase is another piece in the puzzle. See Sargent, 229 F.3d at 73 (largest investment of the year); Warde, 151 F.3d at 48 (\"uncharacteristic, substantial and exceedingly risky investments\" suggested insider trading); Musella, 578 F. Supp. at 441 (unusual trade pattern). Immediately after Larrabee called D'Angelo on December 12, 1995, D'Angelo called his trading assistant, Floramo, and entered orders to purchase approximately 11,000 shares of BankBanks stock, priced at $85 per share, for his own account and those of other family members and his girlfriend. D'Angelo purchased approximately $870,048 worth of BayBanks stock. This purchase was nearly twice as large as any of his previous trades. Immediately after talking with D'Angelo, Floramo called her husband and then purchased 400 shares of BayBanks stock for her personal account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the trades were slow to execute, D'Angelo instructed Floramo to call a PaineWebber trader in New York to urge prompt execution. Floramo testified that she did not recall any other time, in all the years that she worked for him, when D'Angelo asked her to do this. D'Angelo remained on the line until the trades were executed just prior to the close of the market at 4:00 p.m. Floramo testified that this trade was unusual for D'Angelo: i.e., the amount of shares and the fact that they were purchased for his family accounts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the market closed on December 12, 1995, BayBanks and Bank of Boston announced their merger. BayBanks' stock would be converted into shares of Bank of Boston. As a result, BayBanks stock price increased $8 per share before the market opened on December 13, 1995. Before the market opened on December 13th, D'Angelo placed orders to sell all of the shares he purchased the previous evening. D'Angelo, his family and girlfriend realized a profit for those accounts of approximately $86,750.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also find significant the efforts of D'Angelo and Larrabee to conceal their relationship and the purchases made by D'Angelo. See Warde, 151 F.3d at 47 (\"[Defendant's] resort to deceptive trading practices supports an inference that he was trading illegally on insider information.\"). The afternoon after Bank of Boston and BayBanks announced their merger, Eric Selzer, managing attorney at PaineWebber, contacted D'Angelo to inquire why D'Angelo purchased BayBanks stock the previous day. They spoke for approximately thirty minutes. D'Angelo then informed Floramo that he had been questioned by PaineWebber attorneys and that she might be questioned as well. Thereafter, the PaineWebber attorney called Floramo to discuss D'Angelo's trading of BayBanks stock. The call lasted from five to ten minutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After work, Floramo contacted her own attorney. That evening, Floramo arrived home to find three messages from D'Angelo. Floramo returned his call. D'Angelo asked her about her conversation with the PaineWebber attorney, but she responded that she could not speak to him on the matter. D'Angelo asked her to meet him for coffee the following morning at the Mobil Mart next to the office. He had never asked her to do this before. She agreed, but instead went directly to work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D'Angelo attempted to contact Larrabee at home during the evening of December 14. Phone records indicate that Larrabee called D'Angelo at work on the morning of December 14 and the two spoke for approximately eight minutes. D'Angelo called Larrabee again that evening at home at approximately 9:00-9:30 p.m. Larrabee told D'Angelo that he could not talk and hung up.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PaineWebber attorney contacted D'Angelo again in the morning on December 14. The attorney then called Gerald Rath, a partner at Bingham Dana, to give him \"a heads up.\" The PaineWebber attorney informed Rath that Bingham Dana would likely receive other calls regarding the D'Angelo trades, particularly from the SEC. The PaineWebber attorney then described his suspicions about D'Angelo and Larrabee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that afternoon, Rath and Bingham Dana managing partner, Jay Zimmerman, met with Larrabee. When asked about his relationship with D'Angelo, Larrabee told them about their professional relationship. Rath testified that he was made to believe that Larrabee and D'Angelo were not close friends but they shared \"an occasional social relationship.\" Rath directly asked Larrabee about any financial relationship--whether there were any checks or money back and forth. Larrabee responded that there was nothing of value with the exception of one $100 Christmas gift from D'Angelo to Larrabee's children. Larrabee did not mention any of the other payments made by D'Angelo. Rath also questioned Larrabee about recent contact that he had with D'Angelo. Rath directly asked Larrabee when the last time he spoke with D'Angelo. Larrabee responded that it was sometime earlier in the week. In reality, it was earlier that morning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that there was compelling evidence for a jury to determine that Larrabee possessed material, nonpublic information: Larrabee's access to the information; the relationship between Larrabee and D'Angelo; the timing of the contacts between Larrabee, D'Angelo and the trades; the pattern of the trades; and the attempts by Larrabee and D'Angelo to conceal the trades and their relationship with each other. When assembled, the pieces of the puzzle create a picture that supports the inference that Larrabee did possess material, nonpublic information about the bank merger. The defendant also argues that \"the evidence of Mr. Larrabee's 'use' of any 'appropriated' information was insufficient to establish 'misappropriation' beyond a reasonable doubt.\" (Italics in original). The defendant contends that the evidence was insufficient for the jury to infer that Larrabee's tip to D'Angelo was intended for use in connection with the purchase or sale of a security. The second requirement of an insider trading violation is that \"the misappropriator's deceptive use of information be in connection with the purchase and sale of [a] security.\" O'Hagan, 521 U.S. 642, 655-56 (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Larrabee argues that even assuming arguendo that he did possess the material, nonpublic information, the evidence is insufficient for a jury to infer that he gave that information to D'Angelo with the intent that D'Angelo use that information to purchase or sell securities. We disagree. The circumstantial evidence detailed above more than adequately supports the conclusion that Larrabee intended that D'Angelo use the information for purchase or sale of the security.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The tipper's knowledge that he or she was breaching a duty to the owner of confidential information suffices to establish the tipper's expectation that the breach will lead to some kind of misuse of the information. This is so because it may be presumed that the tippee's interest in the information is, in contemporary jargon, not for nothing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sargent, 229 F.3d at 77 (quoting United States v.

There was no clear and gross injustice, and the defendant's conviction is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

Larrabee, was convicted of securities fraud after a jury trial and sentenced to twenty-one months imprisonment, followed by supervised release for a term of two years. He was also fined $20,000. On appeal, the defendant argues that his conviction should be reversed and his sentence vacated because the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law. Finding the evidence sufficient to support the conviction, we affirm the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We describe the facts briefly here, but delve into them in greater detail where necessary for our discussion. Larrabee was employed as Director of Fiduciary Services by the Boston law firm of Bingham Dana &amp; Gould (\"Bingham Dana\"). Larrabee, as Director of Fiduciary Services, controlled the selection of stockbrokers for the placing of securities trades on behalf of the trust accounts managed by Bingham Dana. D'Angelo was employed as a stockbroker by PaineWebber, Inc. and Larrabee directed a large share of Bingham Dana's business to D'Angelo. D'Angelo and Larrabee also shared a personal and financial relationship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From almost December 7, 1995 until December 12, 1995, Bingham Dana represented Bank of Boston in connection with a potential merger with BayBanks. This was a highly confidential transaction. Though few attorneys at Bingham Dana were involved in the transaction, Larrabee had daily contact with at least one, John Brown. Brown visited Larrabee's office frequently to check stock prices and monitor Brown's personal account. Computer records indicate that Larrabee opened Brown's account summary on Larrabee's computer at 3:27 p.m. and 3:28 p.m. on December 12, 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At 3:29 p.m., one minute after opening Brown's account summary, Larrabee placed a call to D'Angelo. The call lasted one minute and twelve seconds. Immediately after Larrabee's call, D'Angelo called his trading assistant, Krista Floramo, and entered orders to purchase approximately 11,000 shares of BayBanks stock, priced at $85 per share, for his own account and those of other family members and his girlfriend. When the trades were slow to be executed, he instructed Floramo to call a PaineWebber trader in New York to urge prompt execution. D'Angelo remained on the line until the trades were executed just prior to the market close at 4:00 p.m. This particular purchase and trading pattern was unusual for D'Angelo. This purchase was nearly twice as large as his previous trades. Moreover, Floramo purchased 400 shares of BayBanks stock for her own account because of the unusual pattern of trades. To her knowledge, D'Angelo never had bought across all of his family accounts at once.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the market closed on December 12, 1995, Bank of Boston and BayBanks announced their merger. As a result of the merger, BayBanks stock price increased by $8 per share before the market opened on December 13, 1995. Before the market opened on December 13, D'Angelo placed orders to sell all the shares he purchased the previous evening. D'Angelo realized a profit for those accounts of approximately $86,750.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PaineWebber attorneys questioned both D'Angelo and Floramo about those trades. D'Angelo attempted to speak with Floramo about her interview and unsuccessfully attempted to contact Larrabee. Larrabee and D'Angelo eventually spoke for approximately eight minutes on the morning of December 14, 1995. PaineWebber officials contacted a Bingham Dana attorney, Gerald Rath, to inform him of their suspicions and that Larrabee's name would likely surface in an SEC investigation. Bingham Dana attorneys then spoke with Larrabee about his contact with D'Angelo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 30, 1998, a federal grand jury returned a nine-count indictment against co-defendants, John C. Larrabee and James L. D'Angelo, charging each with securities fraud in violation of 15aU.S.C. &#167;&#167; 78j(b), 78ff(a) and aiding and abetting in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2. The defendants were tried separately and both were found guilty on all counts. Both filed notices to appeal, but D'Angelo has since withdrawn his appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Larrabee seeks to reverse his conviction, arguing that \"[t]he evidence was not sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Larrabee 'appropriated' material nonpublic information such that he could have 'misappropriated' that information.\" (italics in original).

This can be, and often is, proven by circumstantial evidence. See, e.g., Sargent, 229 F.3d at 74-75. After careful review of the entire record, we find that the evidence was sufficient for a jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Larrabee possessed material, nonpublic information concerning a merger between Bank of Boston and BayBanks and that he conveyed that information to D'Angelo, a stockbroker, with whom he had a close personal and financial relationship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant argues that proof of \"opportunity\" or \"access\" to material, nonpublic information is not the same as proving actual possession. That is correct, but does not carry the day. While the defendant is correct that opportunity alone does not constitute proof of possession, opportunity in combination with circumstantial evidence of a well-timed and well-orchestrated sequence of events, culminating with successful stock trades, creates a compelling inference of possession by the tipper.

We examine myriad factors, including (1) access to information; (2) relationship between the tipper and the tippee; (3) timing of contact between the tipper and the tippee; (4) timing of the trades; (5) pattern of the trades; and (6) attempts to conceal either the trades or the relationship between the tipper and the tippee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence presented at trial, when pieced together, painted a picture which allowed the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Larrabee possessed material, nonpublic information about the Bank of Boston-BayBanks merger. Larrabee had the opportunity to access the information. See Sargent, 229 F.3d at 76 (tipper had access to the information because he shared a small office with the source of the confidential information). Larrabee was the Director of Fiduciary Services at Bingham Dana. Beginning on December 7, 1995, Bingham Dana represented Bank of Boston in connection with a potential merger with BayBanks. This was a highly confidential transaction, with only eight attorneys involved. Two of those eight attorneys, John Brown and Donald Abrams, worked on the seventeenth floor, as did Larrabee. Copies of documents pertaining to the bank merger were left in their \"IN\" boxes, located in the main hallway of the floor and copies were made in the copying room located across from Larrabee's office. The names of the banks involved in the merger were often substituted with code names, but eventually documents were circulated with the correct party names.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Larrabee had daily contact with John Brown. Brown visited Larrabee's office frequently to check stock prices and monitor Brown's personal account. Computer records indicate that Larrabee opened Brown's account summary on Larrabee's computer at 3:27 p.m. and 3:28 p.m. on December 12, 1995. Brown testified that he did not recall telling Larrabee about the bank merger, but admitted that he could not \"say with absolute certainty that [he] didn't say something inadvertently\" to Larrabee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Larrabee's access to the information is not enough to prove that he actually possessed it, when we look further, the inferences taken as a whole, are compelling. First, we note the relationship between Larrabee and D'Angelo. See Warde, 151 F.3d at 45, 48-49 (tipper and tippee had close personal friendship); Musella, 578 F. Supp. at 441 (tipper and tippee were close personal friends). Larrabee and D'Angelo share a personal, financial and professional relationship. Larrabee and D'Angelo had been friends for a long time and their families had spent various weekends, holidays and vacations together. For example, the two families celebrated many New Year's Eves together, including the year prior to this transaction. The Larrabees had an \"open invitation\" to D'Angelo's vacation home and visited it both with D'Angelo and without him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two men also shared a financial relationship. There is evidence in the record that D'Angelo made various payments to Larrabee either directly or indirectly. For example, D'Angelo gave the Larrabee children monetary Christmas presents. The record indicates that D'Angelo made some college tuition payments for Larrabee's children and wrote a check for $1,600 payable to Larrabee's Fidelity Investments account. The two college tuition payments for Larrabee's son totaled almost $23,500, and were made by bank check. A payment of $4,403 was made for the daughter's tuition. Larrabee did not disclose this financial relationship, in violation of Bingham Dana's conflict of interest policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Their relationship also had a professional component. Larrabee, as Director of Fiduciary Services, controlled the selection of stockbrokers for the placing of securities trades on behalf of the trust accounts managed by Bingham Dana. The evidence shows that Larrabee directed a large share of Bingham Dana's business to D'Angelo. In fact, Larrabee estimated that he gave seventy-five to eighty percent of Bingham Dana's business to D'Angelo. Bingham Dana was D'Angelo's largest client.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The timing of the events is also significant. SeeWarde, 151 F.3d at 47-48 (timing of purchases coincided with contact between tipper and tippee); Adler, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1325</span></span>, 1340 (11th Cir. 1998) (suspicious timing of phone calls and trades); cf. SEC v. Truong, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2575446\"><a href=\"/opinion/2575446/sec-v-truong/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1086</span></a></span>, 1097-99 (holding that there was no insider trading when, inter alia, trading did not occur immediately after the calls, but throughout the following week); see also Musella, 578 F. Supp. at 441 (timing of trades significant). Here, the evidence shows that Larrabee opened the account summary of John Brown at 3:27 p.m. and 3:28 p.m. on December 12, 1995. One minute later, at 3:29 p.m., Larrabee called D'Angelo. The call lasted one minute and twelve seconds. Immediately thereafter, D'Angelo called his trading assistant, Krista Floramo. They spoke for fourteen minutes and D'Angelo placed an order for approximately 11,000 shares of BayBanks stock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pattern of the stock purchase is another piece in the puzzle. See Sargent, 229 F.3d at 73 (largest investment of the year); Warde, 151 F.3d at 48 (\"uncharacteristic, substantial and exceedingly risky investments\" suggested insider trading); Musella, 578 F. Supp. at 441 (unusual trade pattern). Immediately after Larrabee called D'Angelo on December 12, 1995, D'Angelo called his trading assistant, Floramo, and entered orders to purchase approximately 11,000 shares of BankBanks stock, priced at $85 per share, for his own account and those of other family members and his girlfriend. D'Angelo purchased approximately $870,048 worth of BayBanks stock. This purchase was nearly twice as large as any of his previous trades. Immediately after talking with D'Angelo, Floramo called her husband and then purchased 400 shares of BayBanks stock for her personal account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the trades were slow to execute, D'Angelo instructed Floramo to call a PaineWebber trader in New York to urge prompt execution. Floramo testified that she did not recall any other time, in all the years that she worked for him, when D'Angelo asked her to do this. D'Angelo remained on the line until the trades were executed just prior to the close of the market at 4:00 p.m. Floramo testified that this trade was unusual for D'Angelo: i.e., the amount of shares and the fact that they were purchased for his family accounts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the market closed on December 12, 1995, BayBanks and Bank of Boston announced their merger. BayBanks' stock would be converted into shares of Bank of Boston. As a result, BayBanks stock price increased $8 per share before the market opened on December 13, 1995. Before the market opened on December 13th, D'Angelo placed orders to sell all of the shares he purchased the previous evening. D'Angelo, his family and girlfriend realized a profit for those accounts of approximately $86,750.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also find significant the efforts of D'Angelo and Larrabee to conceal their relationship and the purchases made by D'Angelo. See Warde, 151 F.3d at 47 (\"[Defendant's] resort to deceptive trading practices supports an inference that he was trading illegally on insider information.\"). The afternoon after Bank of Boston and BayBanks announced their merger, Eric Selzer, managing attorney at PaineWebber, contacted D'Angelo to inquire why D'Angelo purchased BayBanks stock the previous day. They spoke for approximately thirty minutes. D'Angelo then informed Floramo that he had been questioned by PaineWebber attorneys and that she might be questioned as well. Thereafter, the PaineWebber attorney called Floramo to discuss D'Angelo's trading of BayBanks stock. The call lasted from five to ten minutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After work, Floramo contacted her own attorney. That evening, Floramo arrived home to find three messages from D'Angelo. Floramo returned his call. D'Angelo asked her about her conversation with the PaineWebber attorney, but she responded that she could not speak to him on the matter. D'Angelo asked her to meet him for coffee the following morning at the Mobil Mart next to the office. He had never asked her to do this before. She agreed, but instead went directly to work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D'Angelo attempted to contact Larrabee at home during the evening of December 14. Phone records indicate that Larrabee called D'Angelo at work on the morning of December 14 and the two spoke for approximately eight minutes. D'Angelo called Larrabee again that evening at home at approximately 9:00-9:30 p.m. Larrabee told D'Angelo that he could not talk and hung up.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PaineWebber attorney contacted D'Angelo again in the morning on December 14. The attorney then called Gerald Rath, a partner at Bingham Dana, to give him \"a heads up.\" The PaineWebber attorney informed Rath that Bingham Dana would likely receive other calls regarding the D'Angelo trades, particularly from the SEC. The PaineWebber attorney then described his suspicions about D'Angelo and Larrabee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that afternoon, Rath and Bingham Dana managing partner, Jay Zimmerman, met with Larrabee. When asked about his relationship with D'Angelo, Larrabee told them about their professional relationship. Rath testified that he was made to believe that Larrabee and D'Angelo were not close friends but they shared \"an occasional social relationship.\" Rath directly asked Larrabee about any financial relationship--whether there were any checks or money back and forth. Larrabee responded that there was nothing of value with the exception of one $100 Christmas gift from D'Angelo to Larrabee's children. Larrabee did not mention any of the other payments made by D'Angelo. Rath also questioned Larrabee about recent contact that he had with D'Angelo. Rath directly asked Larrabee when the last time he spoke with D'Angelo. Larrabee responded that it was sometime earlier in the week. In reality, it was earlier that morning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that there was compelling evidence for a jury to determine that Larrabee possessed material, nonpublic information: Larrabee's access to the information; the relationship between Larrabee and D'Angelo; the timing of the contacts between Larrabee, D'Angelo and the trades; the pattern of the trades; and the attempts by Larrabee and D'Angelo to conceal the trades and their relationship with each other. When assembled, the pieces of the puzzle create a picture that supports the inference that Larrabee did possess material, nonpublic information about the bank merger. The defendant also argues that \"the evidence of Mr. Larrabee's 'use' of any 'appropriated' information was insufficient to establish 'misappropriation' beyond a reasonable doubt.\" (Italics in original). The defendant contends that the evidence was insufficient for the jury to infer that Larrabee's tip to D'Angelo was intended for use in connection with the purchase or sale of a security. The second requirement of an insider trading violation is that \"the misappropriator's deceptive use of information be in connection with the purchase and sale of [a] security.\" O'Hagan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118143\"><a href=\"/opinion/118143/united-states-v-ohagan/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">642</span></a></span>, 655-56 (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Larrabee argues that even assuming arguendo that he did possess the material, nonpublic information, the evidence is insufficient for a jury to infer that he gave that information to D'Angelo with the intent that D'Angelo use that information to purchase or sell securities. We disagree. The circumstantial evidence detailed above more than adequately supports the conclusion that Larrabee intended that D'Angelo use the information for purchase or sale of the security.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The tipper's knowledge that he or she was breaching a duty to the owner of confidential information suffices to establish the tipper's expectation that the breach will lead to some kind of misuse of the information. This is so because it may be presumed that the tippee's interest in the information is, in contemporary jargon, not for nothing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sargent, 229 F.3d at 77 (quoting United States v. Libera, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"603511\"><a href=\"/opinion/603511/united-states-v-benjamin-b-libera-and-francis-r-sablone-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">596</span></a></span>, 600 (2d Cir. 1993)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on our review of the entire record, we find that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant appropriated material, nonpublic information and then misappropriated that information for use in connection with the purchase or sale of a security.
