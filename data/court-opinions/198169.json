Mary M.

Tucker on brief for appellant.\r\n Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney and Zechariah\r\nChafee, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nOctober 19, 1998\r\n\n                                           Per Curiam.  Upon careful consideration of the briefs\r\nand record, we find no issue for our review.\r\n          1.   Defendant did not ask the district court for\r\ndownward departures on the grounds that he now proposes. \r\nDefendant thus waived for appeal the issue whether the district\r\ncourt erred in denying departures on those grounds.  In any\r\nevent, the denial of such departures would be within the\r\ndistrict court's discretion, and we do not have jurisdiction to\r\nreview such an exercise of discretion.  See United States v.\r\nPierro, 32 F.3d 611, 619 (1st Cir. 1994).  There is no\r\nreasonable basis for defendant's assertion that the district\r\ncourt misunderstood its authority to depart, and there is no\r\nquestion of law in that regard to be reviewed here.\r\n          2.   Defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of\r\ncounsel will not be reviewed on direct appeal.  See United\r\nStates v. Martinez-Martinez, 69 F.3d 1215, 1225 (1st Cir.\r\n1995).  If defendant believes that he has a viable claim in\r\nthat regard, he may raise it in proceedings under 28 U.S.C. \r\n2255.\r\n          Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
