  "plain_text": "            United States Court of Appeals\r\n                For the First Circuit\r\n\nNo. 97-2386\r\n\n                     UNTIED STATES,\r\n                       Appellee,\r\n\n                           v.\r\n\n                     GEORGE SACKO,\r\n                 Defendant, Appellant.\r\n\n                    ORDER OF COURT\r\n\n                       Before:\r\n\n                Torruella, Chief Judge\r\n             Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge\r\n  Selya, Boudin, Stahl, Lynch, Lipez, Circuit Judges\r\n\n                Entered: June 16, 1999\r\n                                     \r\n\n     By petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc, Fed. R.\r\nApp. P. 35(b), the government asks that the panel decision be\r\nwithdrawn and that the district court's sentencing determination be\r\naffirmed because \"[i]n the limited circumstances presented in this\r\ncase, it is appropriate for the district court to examine the PSR\r\nin making its violent felony determination.\"  Petition at 13.  The\r\npetition argues that the panel acted inconsistently with a First\r\nCircuit decision released three days later, in United States v.\r\nDueno, 171 F.3d 3 (1st Cir. 1999), by concluding that \"[i]t was\r\nerror for the district court to delve into the facts of Sacko's\r\ncrime as described in the pre-sentence report in order to determine\r\nwhether his conviction was for a violent or non-violent crime.\" \r\nSacko, slip op. at 7.\r\nAlthough there is an arguable conflict between the language of\r\nthe original Sacko decision and language in Dueno, the Sacko panel\r\nhas altered the original opinion by an erratum released\r\nsimultaneously with this order, thereby resolving the conflict. \r\nContrary to the government's assumption, the alteration does not\r\naffect the result of the appeal; the erratum merely clarifies the\r\nreason why the only facts pertinent to the categorical\r\ndetermination are already established without reference to the pre-\r\nsentence report.  The remand in Sacko was required because this\r\ncourt was unable to determine whether the statutory rape offense\r\ninvolving participants of the ages indicated involved a sufficient\r\nrisk of harm to classify it as a crime of violence, and eliminating\r\nany reference to the pre-sentence report does not ameliorate this\r\nuncertainty.  Consequently, no reason exists for the en banc court\r\nto intervene.\r\nDespite the erratum, however, the en banc court believes that\r\nthis order on reconsideration is appropriate to make clear the en\r\nbanc court's view as to what is now settled law in this circuit and\r\nwhat is left open for future resolution.  The context is a set of\r\nvexing issues concerning the enhancement provision contained in 18\r\nU.S.C.  924(e), as construed by the Supreme Court in Taylor v.\r\nUnited States, 495 U.S. 575, 578-99 (1990).  Particular\r\ndifficulties have attended the application of the statute to cases\r\nthat require judges to determine--under section 924(e)'s\r\n\"otherwise\" clause--whether the crime of statutory rape as defined\r\nby state law constitutes a crime of violence within the meaning of\r\nsection 924(e).\r\nTwo related but different questions have become entangled in\r\nthis inquiry:  one is the substantive question how Taylor's\r\ncategorical approach (as opposed to an approach focusing on\r\ndefendant's conduct) should be applied in deciding whether\r\nstatutory rape is a crime of violence; and the other question, more\r\nprocedural in character, is how far materials other than the\r\nindictment and jury instructions (specifically mentioned in Taylor,\r\n495 U.S. at 602) may be consulted in resolving the substantive\r\nquestion--resort to the pre-sentence report being a particular\r\nsubject of controversy.\r\nOn the substantive issue, we and other circuits have regarded\r\nTaylor's categorical approach, applied in Taylor to the \"burglary\"\r\nclause of section 924(c), as also applying to determinations made\r\nunder the \"otherwise\" clause.  However, this court has been willing\r\non the authority of certain language in Taylor to consider\r\nstatutory rape statutes as if they encompassed different\r\nsubordinate offenses depending on the ages of the participants, at\r\nleast where the specific ages could be ascertained by resort to\r\npermissible sources.  See United States v. Meader, 118 F.3d 876, \r\n882-84 (1st Cir. 1997).  Nothing in our decisions otherwise\r\nwarrants consideration of the circumstances of the particular\r\ncrime.\r\nThe procedural question whether pre-sentence reports may be\r\nconsulted in making the crime of violence determination involves a\r\ndifferent set of considerations.  As already noted, under Taylor's\r\ncategorical approach, facts about the predicate crime are pertinent\r\nonly to identify the statutory or common law offense of which the\r\ndefendant was convicted in the prior case; and collateral facts as\r\nto the defendant's conduct on the earlier occasion are not relevant\r\nfor any other purpose.  Under Taylor, burglary is a crime of\r\nviolence even if no violence was used in the particular case; and,\r\nconversely, being a felon in possession is not a crime of violence\r\neven if the felon happened to shoot someone but was convicted only\r\nunder the felon-in-possession statute.  Cf. United States v. Doe,\r\n960 F.2d 221, 224 (1st Cir. 1992).\r\nOur cases have approved resort to pre-sentence reports but\r\nonly to determine the character of the criminal offense for which\r\nthe defendant was convicted (not whether violence was or was not\r\nused on the particular occasion), see Harris, 964 F.2d at 1236, \r\nwhere that determination cannot be made from the statutory language\r\nitself or from the charging documents, and only where the report\r\nwas sufficiently reliable on this issue, see Dueno, 171 F.3d at 7. \r\nFurther, the court has approved use of the pre-sentence report only\r\nwhen the issue is not settled by the indictment and the conviction\r\nwas by plea of guilty so no jury instructions are available;\r\nwhether resort is proper where the predicate offense was tried has\r\nnot been decided and remains open for future resolution.  See\r\nUnited States v. Winter, 22 F.3d 15, 20 n.8 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\nThe petition for rehearing en banc is denied.  This order\r\nnonetheless is to be published as the order of the en banc court.\r\n\n                              By the Court:\r\n\n                              PHOEBE MORSE, Clerk\r\n\n                              By:        /s/            \r\n                                   Chief Deputy Clerk\r\n\n    cc: Mssrs.
