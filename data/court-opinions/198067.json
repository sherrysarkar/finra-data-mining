This appeal, arising out of a\r\nunique set of facts, raises an important question pertaining to a\r\nbankruptcy court's discretion in authorizing a trustee in a Chapter\r\n11 reorganization to sell the primary asset of the debtor without\r\nfirst resolving allegations of fraud committed by the prospective\r\npurchaser and its principals. The fraud is alleged to have been\r\ncommitted by the purchaser and the debtor's former counsel in the\r\nacquisition of a mortgage against the asset. The debtor's asset\r\ncomprised a group of old mill buildings which the debtor leased to\r\nretail, commercial, and light industrial tenants. Because the\r\nprincipals of the debtor, a partnership that filed the petition for\r\nChapter 11 reorganization, were in prison, the bankruptcy court\r\nappointed a trustee for the estate.\r\nThe Trustee, who had brought an adversary proceeding with\r\nthe approval of the debtor, to set aside the mortgage on the\r\nproperty acquired by assignment from the original mortgagee\r\nallegedly by prepetition fraud, concluded that it would be in the\r\nbest interests of the bankrupt estate to accept an offer to\r\npurchase the property from the mortgagee and settle the adversary\r\nproceeding to set aside the mortgage on it. The bankruptcy court,\r\nover the vigorous objection of the debtor, approved the sale and\r\nsettlement. The debtor timely appealed to the district court which\r\naffirmed. The debtor thereupon appealed to this court. We also\r\naffirm.                                I.\r\nBruce and Andrew Jeremiah are the partners of the debtor,\r\nthe Silver Spring Center, a Rhode Island general partnership. The\r\nSilver Spring Center (the \"Center\"), owned a 500,000-square-foot\r\nformer textile factory complex consisting of approximately 18\r\nbuildings located in Providence, Rhode Island. Its business\r\nessentially was to lease space in this complex to retail,\r\ncommercial, and light industrial tenants. The Jeremiahs previously\r\nhad been tenants in the Center for 30 years and had owned it for\r\napproximately the past 14 years.\r\nIn 1988, the Jeremiahs engaged attorney Z. Hershel Smith\r\nto represent them in a dispute they were having with the Center's\r\nprior mortgagee, the New Bedford Institution for Savings (\"The\r\nBank\"). Upon Smith's recommendation, the Center filed a Chapter 11\r\nbankruptcy petition. While Smith was representing the Center in the\r\nbankruptcy proceedings, it developed that he also was representing\r\nsome of its creditors. Due to this conflict of interests, his\r\nmismanagement of the Center's funds, and a request of the then-\r\nChapter 11 trustee, the Jeremiahs discharged Smith. With the\r\nassistance of new counsel, they negotiated the dismissal of the\r\nreorganization petition in June 1991. Smith has since been\r\ndisbarred, convicted of fraud and embezzlement of clients' funds,\r\nand sentenced to 10 years imprisonment.\r\nIn early 1993, the Jeremiahs began to renegotiate the\r\n$2.1 million mortgage on the Center with the mortgagee. At the same\r\ntime, Smith, without the consent or knowledge of the Jeremiahs,\r\nallegedly also entered into negotiations with their mortgagee on\r\nbehalf of himself and the R.S.S. Realty Trust (\"RSS\"), a Rhode\r\nIsland Corporation, to purchase the mortgage, using confidential\r\ninformation gained during his three-year prior representation of\r\nthe Center. As a result, The Bank ceased negotiations with the\r\nJeremiahs and instead sold the $2.1 million mortgage to RSS for\r\n$200,000. RSS's principals are William Ricci and the Smith Family\r\nTrust, of which attorney Smith's children are the beneficiaries.\r\nRicci, like Smith, also is a convicted felon, having been convicted\r\nof various fraud and other charges.\r\nShortly thereafter, RSS filed an ex parte petition in a\r\nRhode Island state court alleging waste on the part of the Center,\r\nseeking to have the Center placed in receivership, and seeking to\r\nforeclose its recently acquired mortgage. Because of RSS's actions,\r\nin December 1994, the Center once again sought Chapter 11\r\nprotection in the bankruptcy court. Because the Jeremiahs, at the\r\ntime, were in jail for allegedly dealing drugs out of the Center,\r\nthe court appointed the appellee, Andrew S. Richardson, Trustee to\r\noperate the Center. \r\nThe Jeremiahs vehemently contested the validity, extent,\r\nand priority of the mortgage RSS had acquired from the New Bedford\r\nBank. Therefore, the Trustee commenced an adversary proceeding\r\nagainst RSS and Smith in the bankruptcy court. Specifically, the\r\nTrustee sought to have the mortgage declared null and void, or\r\nalternatively, conveyed to the Chapter 11 Trustee, or, as a further\r\nalternative, held in constructive trust for the Jeremiahs. The\r\nTrustee based his complaint primarily upon Smith's prior\r\nrepresentation of the Jeremiahs and the alleged breach of his\r\nfiduciary duties to his former clients. \r\nIn addition to the disputed $2.1 million dollar RSS\r\nmortgage, the Center was subject to (1) liens for $850,000 in\r\nunpaid real estate taxes in favor of the City of Providence for the\r\nperiod 1989 to 1996; (2) a $30,000 lien held by the Providence\r\nWater Supply Board; and (3) a $16,000 lien held by the Narragansett\r\nBay Commission. The property also has significant environmental\r\nproblems which would cost anywhere from $850,000 to at least $1.5\r\nmillion to remedy. Furthermore, the Center is in deteriorating\r\ncondition, particularly the roofs, which need at least a half\r\nmillion to $1 million of repairs. Finally, pre-petition, unsecured\r\ncreditors hold claims for approximately another $75,000, including\r\n$16,000 owed to the United States Coast Guard. \r\nThe Jeremiahs, on the other hand, contend that the\r\nCenter's financial picture is not quite so grim. For instance, they\r\nallege that the real estate taxes can be cut by as much as one-half\r\nbecause the property is significantly overvalued. They also believe\r\nthat the $30,000 Providence Water Supply Board and $16,000\r\nNarragansett Bay Commission liens can be reduced due to errors in\r\nthe meter readings and billings. As is common in a Chapter 11\r\nproceeding, the Jeremiahs have no real financial equity in the\r\nCenter.\r\nDuring the period the Trustee operated the Center, he\r\nearned approximately $5,000 per month \"profit.\"  He achieved this\r\n\"profit,\" however, only by not paying any debt service (i.e., the\r\nmortgage), any real estate taxes, or any payments on the Center's\r\nprepetition outstanding obligations. The Jeremiahs dispute the\r\nTrustee's characterization of the poor financial health of the\r\nCenter, and raise questions about the Trustee's rent collection and\r\naccounts receivable figures, which they contend would show that the\r\nCenter was in better condition than that painted by the Trustee.\r\nWhile the adversary proceeding against RSS and Smith was\r\npending, Ricci submitted a proposal to the Trustee in December\r\n1996, offering to resolve the adversary proceeding and to purchase\r\nthe Center. Ricci's offer consisted of a lump-sum cash payment of\r\n$150,000 to the Trustee in exchange for conveyance of the title to\r\nthe property and dismissal of the adversary proceeding. This\r\n$150,000 would cover all claims held by unsecured creditors and all\r\nadministrative costs of the bankruptcy estate. Ricci's offer to\r\npurchase the Center was subject to all existing liens against the\r\nproperty (except for the $16,000 lien held by the United States\r\nCoast Guard). To assure the purchase, Ricci placed the full\r\n$150,000 purchase price in escrow pending approval of his offer by\r\nthe bankruptcy court.\r\nAlthough the Trustee previously had characterized the\r\nadversary proceeding as a \"good claim\" and thought his chances of\r\nwinning it were favorable, he accepted Ricci's offer. He concluded\r\nthat it was the only credible plan on the horizon;  the Jeremiahs\r\nhad not submitted a viable alternative. Thus, the Trustee filed a\r\nNotice of Intended Sale and Application to Compromise with the\r\nbankruptcy court. He sent a copy of this notice to all creditors\r\nand interested parties. The notice required that any party\r\nobjecting to the proposed sale and compromise file an objection\r\nwith the court by February 7, 1997, and that any higher bids be\r\nsubmitted by that same date along with a 5% deposit.\r\nNo creditors objected to the Trustee's proposed sale and\r\ncompromise, nor did anyone, including the Jeremiahs, submit a\r\ncompeting offer. On the last day permitted, February 7, 1997,\r\nhowever, the Jeremiahs filed an objection and sought additional\r\ntime to make a counteroffer. The basis for their objection was that\r\nthe Ricci proposal would deprive them of their property and that\r\n\"the alleged wrongdoers[- Smith and Ricci -]would be rewarded for\r\ntheir acts.\" The Jeremiahs repeatedly assert or imply throughout\r\ntheir brief that Smith is involved in the purchase of the Center\r\nalong with Ricci. The record, however, contains no evidence to\r\nsupport this assertion. In their objection, the Jeremiahs merely\r\nstated that they would \"arrange to secure payment of 100% of the\r\noutstanding debt to unsecured creditors, and arrange payment of any\r\nand all administrative costs of this bankruptcy, and will presentthis [hypothetical plan]  formally to the court [either] [when\r\nordered by the court or after] the adversary proceeding has been\r\nheard and determined by [the court].\" (emphasis added).\r\nSix days later, on February 13, 1997, the bankruptcy\r\ncourt held a hearing on the proposal. At that time, the Jeremiahs\r\nobjected and again requested additional time to present a\r\ncounteroffer to the court. For their accommodation and as an\r\nadditional opportunity to purchase the property, the court, over\r\nthe Trustee's objections, continued the hearing for six weeks until\r\nMarch 31, 1997. As a condition of the continuance, the court\r\nrequired the Jeremiahs to provide the Trustee with sufficient\r\ncollateral to fund an alternative proposal. Although the Trustee\r\nquestioned the value of the collateral offered, the Jeremiahs\r\ntendered, and the Trustee ultimately accepted, a $175,000 mortgage\r\non the residence of Andrew and Faith Jeremiah.\r\nDuring the six week extension, the Jeremiahs did not come\r\nup with a counteroffer. Not until after the six weeks had expired,\r\non the morning of the March 31, 1997 hearing, did the Jeremiahs\r\nsubmit for the first time their \"proposal.\" Undated, unfiled, and\r\nincomplete, the document, entitled \"Debtor's Proposal to Purchase\r\nAssets,\" stated that the Jeremiahs would pay to the Trustee\r\nsufficient funds to pay (1) all pre- and post-petition creditors\r\nexcepting those from which they had obtained waivers and made\r\nalternative arrangements and (2) all administrative costs, in\r\nexchange for (1) the Trustee's assignment to them of all assets of\r\nthe Silver Spring Center subject to all existing liens, (2) the\r\ncourt's dismissal of the Chapter 11 petition, and (3) the court\r\nretaining jurisdiction over the adversary proceeding. The proposal,\r\nhowever, lacked necessary specifics; it had no purchase price, no\r\ntime frame for completion, or any statement as to how the proposed\r\npayments would be funded. During this hearing, however, the\r\nJeremiahs' attorney stated that he possessed a $20,000 bank check;\r\nthat he had unspecified, undocumented, \"written agreements\" that\r\n$50,000 would be wired to his account before noon that day; that he\r\ncould sell within two weeks an undocumented and unsubstantiated\r\nRolls Royce for $40,000; and that he had signed waivers from\r\nseveral unsecured creditors totaling almost $70,000. \r\nThe Trustee recommended that the court reject this last-\r\nminute proposal as inadequate. The court agreed with the Trustee's\r\nassessment, concluding that the Jeremiahs' \"constant last-minute\r\nefforts . . . just d[id]n't cut it.\" The court then accepted the\r\nTrustee's business judgment, and \"reluctantly\" approved the sale\r\nand compromise. In its brief, two-page order that followed, the\r\ncourt explained that its approval was based on the reasons argued\r\nby the Trustee, the United States Trustee, and counsel representing\r\nRicci, and that the proposed compromise and sale were in the best\r\ninterest of the estate. The court concluded that the Trustee's\r\nproposal constituted a reasonable exercise of his business\r\njudgment.\r\nThe Jeremiahs appealed to the district court and obtained\r\na stay. Subsequently, the district court duly entered a judgment\r\nand order vacating the stay, and affirming the bankruptcy court's\r\napproval of the sale and compromise. The Jeremiahs again appealed\r\nand moved that this court waive the requirement of a supersedeas\r\nbond to stay the proposed sale. This court denied their motion. On\r\nMarch 5, 1998, the Trustee conveyed all his right, title, and\r\ninterest in the Silver Spring Center to S.S.C. Realty Associates,\r\nas the nominee of William Ricci.\r\n                          II.\r\nAlthough both parties raise several issues on appeal, the\r\ndispositive issue is whether, in light of the credible allegations\r\nof fraud surrounding the Center's mortgage, the bankruptcy court's\r\napproval of the Trustee's proposed sale and compromise to Ricci\r\nconstituted an abuse of the court's discretion. We discuss the\r\nsubordinate issues briefly before addressing the abuse of\r\ndiscretion question.\r\nA.   Jurisdiction\r\nThe Jeremiahs' first argument is that the bankruptcy\r\ncourt lacked jurisdiction because it had not yet determined the\r\nstatus of the adversary proceeding pending against Smith and RSS.\r\nThis is so, they contend, because a bankruptcy court, as a court of\r\nequity, lacks jurisdiction to further a fraudulent purpose.\r\nAlthough this court's opinion in In re Coastal Cable T.V., Inc.,\r\n709 F.2d 762, 764 (1st Cir. 1983), seems to lend some credence for\r\nthat premise, as will be discussed more fully when resolving the\r\nabuse of discretion issue, the bankruptcy court's order did not\r\nresult in \"injustice or unfairness . . . in the administration of\r\nthe bankruptcy estate.\"  See id. The Trustee and the court both\r\nwere fully aware of all of the allegations of fraud surrounding\r\nRSS's acquisition of the Center's mortgage and Smith's alleged\r\nunethical involvement. Unlike the situation in Coastal Cable, the\r\nbankruptcy court here held several hearings on the record during\r\nwhich the issue was discussed extensively and during which the\r\ncourt even assumed the Jeremiahs' success in the adversary\r\nproceeding against RSS and Smith. Nonetheless, after hearing\r\ntestimony and evaluating all the facts, the court reached the\r\nconsidered conclusion that Ricci's proposal was in the best\r\ninterests of the estate. Thus, only then did the court\r\n\"reluctantly\" approve the sale and the compromise of the adversary\r\nproceeding.\r\nMoreover, although Coastal Cable requires that \"there\r\nmust be some relation--at least an arguable relation--between the\r\nChapter 11 plan and the reorganization-related purposes that the\r\nChapter was designed to serve,\" see id. at 764, here the Jeremiahs\r\npresented neither a live plan of reorganization nor a comparable\r\npurchase offer for the property. As the bankruptcy court found, the\r\nJeremiahs' last-minute efforts and proposal were without merit;\r\nthey just did not \"cut it.\"  No one used the court to further\r\nfraudulent conduct; every effort was exerted to achieve the best\r\ninterests of the estate. Thus, the issue here is not whether the\r\ncourt was being used to further a fraudulent purpose, and thus\r\npotentially lacked jurisdiction, but did the court abuse its\r\ndiscretion in concluding that the sale and compromise--the only\r\ncredible proposal on the table--were in the best interests of the\r\nestate.\r\nB.  Sufficiency of the Record\r\nThe Jeremiahs' second argument is that the record is\r\ninsufficient to demonstrate that the bankruptcy court made a\r\nthorough analysis of all the relevant factors and an informed,\r\nindependent judgment. The record, however, is replete with evidence\r\nthat the court made a thorough analysis, fully and patiently\r\ninformed itself of the relevant facts, and carefully exercised\r\nindependent judgment. It held at least five on-the-record hearings\r\nover many months, during which both parties repeatedly presented\r\ntheir respective positions to the court in detail. The court also\r\nprovided the Jeremiahs, over the objections of the Trustee,  with\r\nan extension of six weeks to give them an opportunity to present a\r\nworkable solution before approving the sale and compromise.\r\nMoreover, the requirement that the court's judgment be\r\nindependent does not necessarily mean that it cannot match the\r\njudgment of the Trustee. We do not agree with the Jeremiahs that\r\nthe judgment of the court cannot be independent unless it differs\r\nfrom the Trustee's. Although the court accepted the proposal and\r\nreasoning of the Trustee, it did so only after searching hearings\r\ninvolving all parties and its independent conclusion that the\r\nproposal was in the best interest of the estate.\r\nFinally, though the court adopted the reasons proffered\r\nby the Trustee and even \"welcome[d]\" his business judgment, the\r\ncourt did summarize on the record its reasons. During the March\r\n31st hearing, the court stated its conclusions in over one and one-\r\nhalf pages of recorded transcript which unmistakably demonstrated\r\nthat it was exercising its own judgment, even though identical to\r\nthe Trustee's.\r\nWe believe that the bankruptcy court informed itself of\r\nthe relevant factors and established a sufficient basis on which it\r\nexercised its own independent judgment.\r\nC.  Good Faith Purchaser Under Section 363(m)\r\nThe Trustee correctly argues that under section 363(m) of\r\nthe Bankruptcy Code this court cannot invalidate the Trustee's sale\r\nto Ricci/SSC Realty if Ricci qualifies as a good faith purchaser.\r\nAlthough the Trustee argues that this is the case here, section\r\n363(m) is not applicable to the facts of this case.  \"A 'good\r\nfaith' purchaser is one who buys property in good faith and for\r\nvalue, without knowledge of adverse claims.\"  In re Mark Bell\r\nFurniture Warehouse, Inc., 992 F.2d 7, 8 (1st Cir. 1993) (emphasis\r\nadded) (citations omitted). Here, it is unquestionable that Ricci\r\nhad knowledge of the adverse claim--i.e., the adversary proceeding-\r\n-instituted by the Trustee against him. The Trustee cannot defeat\r\nthe Jeremiahs' claim by draping Ricci in the garment of a good\r\nfaith purchaser when he clearly had notice and knowledge of the\r\nvery same claim which lies at the heart of the disputed compromise\r\nbefore us. Notwithstanding that Ricci/SSC Realty is not a good\r\nfaith purchaser under  363(m), we believe that this conclusion\r\ndoes not affect our analysis.\r\nD.  Did the Bankruptcy Court Abuse Its Discretion?\r\nOn appeal from the district court, we independently\r\nreview the bankruptcy court's decision. The approval of a sale of\r\na bankruptcy estate's assets or a compromise of an adversary claim\r\nis within the sound discretion of the bankruptcy judge, and we will\r\nnot upset it absent a clear showing that the bankruptcy judge\r\nabused his discretion. See Jeffrey v. Desmond, 70 F.3d 183, 185\r\n(1st Cir. 1995) (internal citations omitted) (citing In re Anolik,\r\n107 B.R. 426, 429 (D. Mass. 1989) (collecting cases)); see also  In\r\nre Thrifty Liquors, Inc., 26 B.R. 26, 28 (D. Mass. 1982) (\"The\r\nCourt is loath to interfere with the Trustee's business decision in\r\nregard to . . . the propriety of the proposed sale.\").\r\nIn deciding whether to approve a compromise of a lawsuit,\r\nthe specific factors a bankruptcy court should consider include:\r\n\"(i) the probability of success in the litigation being\r\ncompromised; (ii) the difficulties, if any, to be encountered in\r\nthe matter of collection; (iii) the complexity of the litigation\r\ninvolved, and the expense, inconvenience and delay attending it;\r\nand, (iv) the paramount interest of the creditors and a proper\r\ndeference to their reasonable views in the premise.\" See Jeffrey,\r\n70 F.3d at 185. The court's consideration of these factors should\r\ndemonstrate whether the compromise is fair and equitable, and\r\nwhether the claim the debtor is giving up is outweighed by the\r\nadvantage to the debtor's estate. Although Jeffrey involved a\r\nChapter 7 petition, courts routinely use these same principles in\r\nthe Chapter 11 context. See, e.g., In re Pennsylvania Truck Lines,\r\nInc., 150 B.R. 595, (E.D. Pa. 1992).\r\nIn the instant case, the record amply demonstrates that\r\nthe court carefully weighed these factors in deciding to approve\r\nthe sale and compromise. The court did not act mechanistically or\r\nimpulsively. It realized that the Trustee assumed that the\r\nadversary litigation would not be complex and that he probably\r\nwould triumph. However, even if the Trustee were successful in the\r\nadversary proceeding, there was a substantial risk that RSS would\r\nretain a claim for \"at least $200,000 against the estate,\" the\r\namount it had paid the New Bedford Bank for an assignment of the\r\noriginal mortgage. The Jeremiahs, by contrast, did not address this\r\nconcern. Thus, because the Jeremiahs had no financial equity in the\r\nproperty and did not put forward a credible plan or offer, the\r\ndispositive issue for the court ultimately was whether the\r\ncompromise and sale were in the best interests of the estate. The\r\ncourt reasonably concluded that they were.\r\nAlthough the bankruptcy court was faced with some\r\nunsavory and troublesome circumstances, in reality, it had no\r\nchoice but to approve the proposal. Regardless of the court's\r\nreluctance to approve a sale of the property to a purchaser of\r\nquestionable repute and allegedly unethical conduct in the\r\nacquisition of the mortgage, any other decision might have been\r\ncostly to the estate and an abuse of the court's discretion. The\r\nCenter had been in and out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy for\r\napproximately nine years. A trustee had been appointed and was\r\nrunning the Center--extraordinary in a Chapter 11 proceeding, seeDavid G. Epstein, et al., Bankruptcy,  10.8, at 745 (1993)--\r\nbecause the Jeremiahs were in prison for dealing drugs out of the\r\nCenter and unavailable to run it themselves. There appeared to be\r\nno end in sight.\r\nThe Center also was woefully behind in its tax and\r\nutility payments. It had not made a real estate tax payment to the\r\nCity of Providence since 1989 and was subject to  real estate tax\r\nliens that were rapidly approaching $1 million. In addition, the\r\nProvidence Water Supply Board and the Narragansett Bay Commission\r\nheld $30,000 and $16,000 liens, respectively, on the property. The\r\nCenter also has at least $850,000 to $1.5 million worth of\r\nenvironmental problems, is in deteriorating condition, with the\r\nroof alone needing between a half million and $1 million worth of\r\nrepairs. In addition, prepetition, unsecured creditors held claims\r\nfor approximately another $75,000. Although the Trustee, in\r\noperating the Center, had an illusory \"profit\" of $5,000 per month,\r\nthis was achieved only by not making payments on the mortgage, and\r\nby withholding payment of real estate taxes and any payments\r\ntowards any of the Center's prepetition outstanding obligations.\r\nFurthermore, it appears that much-needed repairs and capital\r\nimprovements were ignored.\r\nSince the time the Jeremiahs sought Chapter 11 protection\r\nin 1994, they unfortunately never once put forward a credible\r\nproposal to reorganize the Center's debts and to resume its\r\noperation. Even their so-called \"proposal\" submitted at the March\r\n31st hearing lacked specific information regarding the value of the\r\nproposal, how it would be funded, or even the time frame during\r\nwhich it would be implemented. Furthermore, even the\r\nrepresentations of the Jeremiahs' counsel were lacking in\r\nspecifics, referring mostly to undocumented and unverifiable monies\r\nand assets to be pledged in the future. Moreover, after notice by\r\nthe Trustee of the proposed sale and compromise, no creditor\r\nobjected. In the end, after marketing efforts, the targeting of\r\nother potential buyers, and the holding of discussions with others,\r\nRicci made the only credible proposal. Faced with these facts,\r\nwhich are fully documented on the record, the court appears to have\r\nmade the only reasonable choice available in approving the proposed\r\nsale and compromise.\r\nFinally, although the court fully adopted the reasoning\r\nof the Trustee in its final order and judgment, it articulated some\r\nof its own reasons for approving the plan during the March 31st\r\nhearing.\r\n  In this case I welcome the Trustee's\r\nbusiness judgment test. I think I've heard\r\nabout as much as can be said in behalf of the\r\nJeremiahs and the debtor in this case. This is\r\na situation that no one in their right mind\r\ncould possibly like if they're looking at it\r\nfrom an objective position. It's been--it's\r\nbeen unpleasant. It's been questionable.\r\nEthics are totally missing--I don't know when\r\nthis--the whole thing originated, but it's\r\njust a [sic] unsavory situation that has come\r\ndown to the place where it is. [The debtor's\r\nattorney's] efforts to--in his client's\r\nbehalf--and nobody questions his right or his\r\nobligation to do that--would merely place us\r\nback where we were, moving along with the\r\nlitigation, before the Trustee comes up with\r\nthis offer. It's the only show in town. It's\r\nthe only viable show in town.\r\n\n(App. 141-42).\r\nIn sum, the court made an informed, reasoned, and\r\nindependent decision to approve, albeit reluctantly,  the\r\nTrustee'application to compromise and sale. We cannot conclude that\r\nit amounted to an abuse of the court's discretion.\r\n                          III.\r\nAccordingly, we hold that despite the debtor's\r\nallegations of fraud and unethical behavior leveled at the\r\npurchaser, the bankruptcy court's approval of the Trustee's sale\r\nand compromise did not amount to an abuse of the court's\r\ndiscretion. The court regrettably lacked a realistic alternative\r\nproposal and it fairly considered the merits of the proposal put\r\nforward by the Trustee and the realities of the estate's desperate\r\nsituation. The district court's judgment affirming the judgment of\r\nthe bankruptcy court is affirmed. Each side to bear its own costs.\r\n",

This appeal, arising out of a\r\nunique set of facts, raises an important question pertaining to a\r\nbankruptcy court's discretion in authorizing a trustee in a Chapter\r\n11 reorganization to sell the primary asset of the debtor without\r\nfirst resolving allegations of fraud committed by the prospective\r\npurchaser and its principals. The fraud is alleged to have been\r\ncommitted by the purchaser and the debtor's former counsel in the\r\nacquisition of a mortgage against the asset. The debtor's asset\r\ncomprised a group of old mill buildings which the debtor leased to\r\nretail, commercial, and light industrial tenants. Because the\r\nprincipals of the debtor, a partnership that filed the petition for\r\nChapter 11 reorganization, were in prison, the bankruptcy court\r\nappointed a trustee for the estate.\r\nThe Trustee, who had brought an adversary proceeding with\r\nthe approval of the debtor, to set aside the mortgage on the\r\nproperty acquired by assignment from the original mortgagee\r\nallegedly by prepetition fraud, concluded that it would be in the\r\nbest interests of the bankrupt estate to accept an offer to\r\npurchase the property from the mortgagee and settle the adversary\r\nproceeding to set aside the mortgage on it. The bankruptcy court,\r\nover the vigorous objection of the debtor, approved the sale and\r\nsettlement. The debtor timely appealed to the district court which\r\naffirmed. The debtor thereupon appealed to this court. We also\r\naffirm.                                I.\r\nBruce and Andrew Jeremiah are the partners of the debtor,\r\nthe Silver Spring Center, a Rhode Island general partnership. The\r\nSilver Spring Center (the \"Center\"), owned a 500,000-square-foot\r\nformer textile factory complex consisting of approximately 18\r\nbuildings located in Providence, Rhode Island. Its business\r\nessentially was to lease space in this complex to retail,\r\ncommercial, and light industrial tenants. The Jeremiahs previously\r\nhad been tenants in the Center for 30 years and had owned it for\r\napproximately the past 14 years.\r\nIn 1988, the Jeremiahs engaged attorney Z. Hershel Smith\r\nto represent them in a dispute they were having with the Center's\r\nprior mortgagee, the New Bedford Institution for Savings (\"The\r\nBank\"). Upon Smith's recommendation, the Center filed a Chapter 11\r\nbankruptcy petition. While Smith was representing the Center in the\r\nbankruptcy proceedings, it developed that he also was representing\r\nsome of its creditors. Due to this conflict of interests, his\r\nmismanagement of the Center's funds, and a request of the then-\r\nChapter 11 trustee, the Jeremiahs discharged Smith. With the\r\nassistance of new counsel, they negotiated the dismissal of the\r\nreorganization petition in June 1991. Smith has since been\r\ndisbarred, convicted of fraud and embezzlement of clients' funds,\r\nand sentenced to 10 years imprisonment.\r\nIn early 1993, the Jeremiahs began to renegotiate the\r\n$2.1 million mortgage on the Center with the mortgagee. At the same\r\ntime, Smith, without the consent or knowledge of the Jeremiahs,\r\nallegedly also entered into negotiations with their mortgagee on\r\nbehalf of himself and the R.S.S. Realty Trust (\"RSS\"), a Rhode\r\nIsland Corporation, to purchase the mortgage, using confidential\r\ninformation gained during his three-year prior representation of\r\nthe Center. As a result, The Bank ceased negotiations with the\r\nJeremiahs and instead sold the $2.1 million mortgage to RSS for\r\n$200,000. RSS's principals are William Ricci and the Smith Family\r\nTrust, of which attorney Smith's children are the beneficiaries.\r\nRicci, like Smith, also is a convicted felon, having been convicted\r\nof various fraud and other charges.\r\nShortly thereafter, RSS filed an ex parte petition in a\r\nRhode Island state court alleging waste on the part of the Center,\r\nseeking to have the Center placed in receivership, and seeking to\r\nforeclose its recently acquired mortgage. Because of RSS's actions,\r\nin December 1994, the Center once again sought Chapter 11\r\nprotection in the bankruptcy court. Because the Jeremiahs, at the\r\ntime, were in jail for allegedly dealing drugs out of the Center,\r\nthe court appointed the appellee, Andrew S. Richardson, Trustee to\r\noperate the Center. \r\nThe Jeremiahs vehemently contested the validity, extent,\r\nand priority of the mortgage RSS had acquired from the New Bedford\r\nBank. Therefore, the Trustee commenced an adversary proceeding\r\nagainst RSS and Smith in the bankruptcy court. Specifically, the\r\nTrustee sought to have the mortgage declared null and void, or\r\nalternatively, conveyed to the Chapter 11 Trustee, or, as a further\r\nalternative, held in constructive trust for the Jeremiahs. The\r\nTrustee based his complaint primarily upon Smith's prior\r\nrepresentation of the Jeremiahs and the alleged breach of his\r\nfiduciary duties to his former clients. \r\nIn addition to the disputed $2.1 million dollar RSS\r\nmortgage, the Center was subject to (1) liens for $850,000 in\r\nunpaid real estate taxes in favor of the City of Providence for the\r\nperiod 1989 to 1996; (2) a $30,000 lien held by the Providence\r\nWater Supply Board; and (3) a $16,000 lien held by the Narragansett\r\nBay Commission. The property also has significant environmental\r\nproblems which would cost anywhere from $850,000 to at least $1.5\r\nmillion to remedy. Furthermore, the Center is in deteriorating\r\ncondition, particularly the roofs, which need at least a half\r\nmillion to $1 million of repairs. Finally, pre-petition, unsecured\r\ncreditors hold claims for approximately another $75,000, including\r\n$16,000 owed to the United States Coast Guard. \r\nThe Jeremiahs, on the other hand, contend that the\r\nCenter's financial picture is not quite so grim. For instance, they\r\nallege that the real estate taxes can be cut by as much as one-half\r\nbecause the property is significantly overvalued. They also believe\r\nthat the $30,000 Providence Water Supply Board and $16,000\r\nNarragansett Bay Commission liens can be reduced due to errors in\r\nthe meter readings and billings. As is common in a Chapter 11\r\nproceeding, the Jeremiahs have no real financial equity in the\r\nCenter.\r\nDuring the period the Trustee operated the Center, he\r\nearned approximately $5,000 per month \"profit.\"  He achieved this\r\n\"profit,\" however, only by not paying any debt service (i.e., the\r\nmortgage), any real estate taxes, or any payments on the Center's\r\nprepetition outstanding obligations. The Jeremiahs dispute the\r\nTrustee's characterization of the poor financial health of the\r\nCenter, and raise questions about the Trustee's rent collection and\r\naccounts receivable figures, which they contend would show that the\r\nCenter was in better condition than that painted by the Trustee.\r\nWhile the adversary proceeding against RSS and Smith was\r\npending, Ricci submitted a proposal to the Trustee in December\r\n1996, offering to resolve the adversary proceeding and to purchase\r\nthe Center. Ricci's offer consisted of a lump-sum cash payment of\r\n$150,000 to the Trustee in exchange for conveyance of the title to\r\nthe property and dismissal of the adversary proceeding. This\r\n$150,000 would cover all claims held by unsecured creditors and all\r\nadministrative costs of the bankruptcy estate. Ricci's offer to\r\npurchase the Center was subject to all existing liens against the\r\nproperty (except for the $16,000 lien held by the United States\r\nCoast Guard). To assure the purchase, Ricci placed the full\r\n$150,000 purchase price in escrow pending approval of his offer by\r\nthe bankruptcy court.\r\nAlthough the Trustee previously had characterized the\r\nadversary proceeding as a \"good claim\" and thought his chances of\r\nwinning it were favorable, he accepted Ricci's offer. He concluded\r\nthat it was the only credible plan on the horizon;  the Jeremiahs\r\nhad not submitted a viable alternative. Thus, the Trustee filed a\r\nNotice of Intended Sale and Application to Compromise with the\r\nbankruptcy court. He sent a copy of this notice to all creditors\r\nand interested parties. The notice required that any party\r\nobjecting to the proposed sale and compromise file an objection\r\nwith the court by February 7, 1997, and that any higher bids be\r\nsubmitted by that same date along with a 5% deposit.\r\nNo creditors objected to the Trustee's proposed sale and\r\ncompromise, nor did anyone, including the Jeremiahs, submit a\r\ncompeting offer. On the last day permitted, February 7, 1997,\r\nhowever, the Jeremiahs filed an objection and sought additional\r\ntime to make a counteroffer. The basis for their objection was that\r\nthe Ricci proposal would deprive them of their property and that\r\n\"the alleged wrongdoers[- Smith and Ricci -]would be rewarded for\r\ntheir acts.\" The Jeremiahs repeatedly assert or imply throughout\r\ntheir brief that Smith is involved in the purchase of the Center\r\nalong with Ricci. The record, however, contains no evidence to\r\nsupport this assertion. In their objection, the Jeremiahs merely\r\nstated that they would \"arrange to secure payment of 100% of the\r\noutstanding debt to unsecured creditors, and arrange payment of any\r\nand all administrative costs of this bankruptcy, and will presentthis [hypothetical plan]  formally to the court [either] [when\r\nordered by the court or after] the adversary proceeding has been\r\nheard and determined by [the court].\" (emphasis added).\r\nSix days later, on February 13, 1997, the bankruptcy\r\ncourt held a hearing on the proposal. At that time, the Jeremiahs\r\nobjected and again requested additional time to present a\r\ncounteroffer to the court. For their accommodation and as an\r\nadditional opportunity to purchase the property, the court, over\r\nthe Trustee's objections, continued the hearing for six weeks until\r\nMarch 31, 1997. As a condition of the continuance, the court\r\nrequired the Jeremiahs to provide the Trustee with sufficient\r\ncollateral to fund an alternative proposal. Although the Trustee\r\nquestioned the value of the collateral offered, the Jeremiahs\r\ntendered, and the Trustee ultimately accepted, a $175,000 mortgage\r\non the residence of Andrew and Faith Jeremiah.\r\nDuring the six week extension, the Jeremiahs did not come\r\nup with a counteroffer. Not until after the six weeks had expired,\r\non the morning of the March 31, 1997 hearing, did the Jeremiahs\r\nsubmit for the first time their \"proposal.\" Undated, unfiled, and\r\nincomplete, the document, entitled \"Debtor's Proposal to Purchase\r\nAssets,\" stated that the Jeremiahs would pay to the Trustee\r\nsufficient funds to pay (1) all pre- and post-petition creditors\r\nexcepting those from which they had obtained waivers and made\r\nalternative arrangements and (2) all administrative costs, in\r\nexchange for (1) the Trustee's assignment to them of all assets of\r\nthe Silver Spring Center subject to all existing liens, (2) the\r\ncourt's dismissal of the Chapter 11 petition, and (3) the court\r\nretaining jurisdiction over the adversary proceeding. The proposal,\r\nhowever, lacked necessary specifics; it had no purchase price, no\r\ntime frame for completion, or any statement as to how the proposed\r\npayments would be funded. During this hearing, however, the\r\nJeremiahs' attorney stated that he possessed a $20,000 bank check;\r\nthat he had unspecified, undocumented, \"written agreements\" that\r\n$50,000 would be wired to his account before noon that day; that he\r\ncould sell within two weeks an undocumented and unsubstantiated\r\nRolls Royce for $40,000; and that he had signed waivers from\r\nseveral unsecured creditors totaling almost $70,000. \r\nThe Trustee recommended that the court reject this last-\r\nminute proposal as inadequate. The court agreed with the Trustee's\r\nassessment, concluding that the Jeremiahs' \"constant last-minute\r\nefforts . . . just d[id]n't cut it.\" The court then accepted the\r\nTrustee's business judgment, and \"reluctantly\" approved the sale\r\nand compromise. In its brief, two-page order that followed, the\r\ncourt explained that its approval was based on the reasons argued\r\nby the Trustee, the United States Trustee, and counsel representing\r\nRicci, and that the proposed compromise and sale were in the best\r\ninterest of the estate. The court concluded that the Trustee's\r\nproposal constituted a reasonable exercise of his business\r\njudgment.\r\nThe Jeremiahs appealed to the district court and obtained\r\na stay. Subsequently, the district court duly entered a judgment\r\nand order vacating the stay, and affirming the bankruptcy court's\r\napproval of the sale and compromise. The Jeremiahs again appealed\r\nand moved that this court waive the requirement of a supersedeas\r\nbond to stay the proposed sale. This court denied their motion. On\r\nMarch 5, 1998, the Trustee conveyed all his right, title, and\r\ninterest in the Silver Spring Center to S.S.C. Realty Associates,\r\nas the nominee of William Ricci.\r\n                          II.\r\nAlthough both parties raise several issues on appeal, the\r\ndispositive issue is whether, in light of the credible allegations\r\nof fraud surrounding the Center's mortgage, the bankruptcy court's\r\napproval of the Trustee's proposed sale and compromise to Ricci\r\nconstituted an abuse of the court's discretion. We discuss the\r\nsubordinate issues briefly before addressing the abuse of\r\ndiscretion question.\r\nA.   Jurisdiction\r\nThe Jeremiahs' first argument is that the bankruptcy\r\ncourt lacked jurisdiction because it had not yet determined the\r\nstatus of the adversary proceeding pending against Smith and RSS.\r\nThis is so, they contend, because a bankruptcy court, as a court of\r\nequity, lacks jurisdiction to further a fraudulent purpose.\r\nAlthough this court's opinion in In re Coastal Cable T.V., Inc.,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"419920\"><a href=\"/opinion/419920/in-re-coastal-cable-t-v-inc-debtor-gerald-connell-v-coastal-cable-t/\"><span class=\"volume\">709</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">762</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 764 (1st Cir. 1983), seems to lend some credence for\r\nthat premise, as will be discussed more fully when resolving the\r\nabuse of discretion issue, the bankruptcy court's order did not\r\nresult in \"injustice or unfairness . . . in the administration of\r\nthe bankruptcy estate.\"  See id. The Trustee and the court both\r\nwere fully aware of all of the allegations of fraud surrounding\r\nRSS's acquisition of the Center's mortgage and Smith's alleged\r\nunethical involvement. Unlike the situation in Coastal Cable, the\r\nbankruptcy court here held several hearings on the record during\r\nwhich the issue was discussed extensively and during which the\r\ncourt even assumed the Jeremiahs' success in the adversary\r\nproceeding against RSS and Smith. Nonetheless, after hearing\r\ntestimony and evaluating all the facts, the court reached the\r\nconsidered conclusion that Ricci's proposal was in the best\r\ninterests of the estate. Thus, only then did the court\r\n\"reluctantly\" approve the sale and the compromise of the adversary\r\nproceeding.\r\nMoreover, although Coastal Cable requires that \"there\r\nmust be some relation--at least an arguable relation--between the\r\nChapter 11 plan and the reorganization-related purposes that the\r\nChapter was designed to serve,\" see id. at 764, here the Jeremiahs\r\npresented neither a live plan of reorganization nor a comparable\r\npurchase offer for the property. As the bankruptcy court found, the\r\nJeremiahs' last-minute efforts and proposal were without merit;\r\nthey just did not \"cut it.\"  No one used the court to further\r\nfraudulent conduct; every effort was exerted to achieve the best\r\ninterests of the estate. Thus, the issue here is not whether the\r\ncourt was being used to further a fraudulent purpose, and thus\r\npotentially lacked jurisdiction, but did the court abuse its\r\ndiscretion in concluding that the sale and compromise--the only\r\ncredible proposal on the table--were in the best interests of the\r\nestate.\r\nB.  Sufficiency of the Record\r\nThe Jeremiahs' second argument is that the record is\r\ninsufficient to demonstrate that the bankruptcy court made a\r\nthorough analysis of all the relevant factors and an informed,\r\nindependent judgment. The record, however, is replete with evidence\r\nthat the court made a thorough analysis, fully and patiently\r\ninformed itself of the relevant facts, and carefully exercised\r\nindependent judgment. It held at least five on-the-record hearings\r\nover many months, during which both parties repeatedly presented\r\ntheir respective positions to the court in detail. The court also\r\nprovided the Jeremiahs, over the objections of the Trustee,  with\r\nan extension of six weeks to give them an opportunity to present a\r\nworkable solution before approving the sale and compromise.\r\nMoreover, the requirement that the court's judgment be\r\nindependent does not necessarily mean that it cannot match the\r\njudgment of the Trustee. We do not agree with the Jeremiahs that\r\nthe judgment of the court cannot be independent unless it differs\r\nfrom the Trustee's. Although the court accepted the proposal and\r\nreasoning of the Trustee, it did so only after searching hearings\r\ninvolving all parties and its independent conclusion that the\r\nproposal was in the best interest of the estate.\r\nFinally, though the court adopted the reasons proffered\r\nby the Trustee and even \"welcome[d]\" his business judgment, the\r\ncourt did summarize on the record its reasons. During the March\r\n31st hearing, the court stated its conclusions in over one and one-\r\nhalf pages of recorded transcript which unmistakably demonstrated\r\nthat it was exercising its own judgment, even though identical to\r\nthe Trustee's.\r\nWe believe that the bankruptcy court informed itself of\r\nthe relevant factors and established a sufficient basis on which it\r\nexercised its own independent judgment.\r\nC.  Good Faith Purchaser Under Section 363(m)\r\nThe Trustee correctly argues that under section 363(m) of\r\nthe Bankruptcy Code this court cannot invalidate the Trustee's sale\r\nto Ricci/SSC Realty if Ricci qualifies as a good faith purchaser.\r\nAlthough the Trustee argues that this is the case here, section\r\n363(m) is not applicable to the facts of this case.  \"A 'good\r\nfaith' purchaser is one who buys property in good faith and for\r\nvalue, without knowledge of adverse claims.\"  In re Mark Bell\r\nFurniture Warehouse, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"605603\"><a href=\"/opinion/605603/bankr-l-rep-p-75253-in-re-mark-bell-furniture-warehouse-incorporated/\"><span class=\"volume\">992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 8 (1st Cir. 1993) (emphasis\r\nadded) (citations omitted). Here, it is unquestionable that Ricci\r\nhad knowledge of the adverse claim--i.e., the adversary proceeding-\r\n-instituted by the Trustee against him. The Trustee cannot defeat\r\nthe Jeremiahs' claim by draping Ricci in the garment of a good\r\nfaith purchaser when he clearly had notice and knowledge of the\r\nvery same claim which lies at the heart of the disputed compromise\r\nbefore us. Notwithstanding that Ricci/SSC Realty is not a good\r\nfaith purchaser under  363(m), we believe that this conclusion\r\ndoes not affect our analysis.\r\nD.  Did the Bankruptcy Court Abuse Its Discretion?\r\nOn appeal from the district court, we independently\r\nreview the bankruptcy court's decision. The approval of a sale of\r\na bankruptcy estate's assets or a compromise of an adversary claim\r\nis within the sound discretion of the bankruptcy judge, and we will\r\nnot upset it absent a clear showing that the bankruptcy judge\r\nabused his discretion. See Jeffrey v. Desmond, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196420\"><a href=\"/opinion/196420/jeffrey-and-jeffrey-v-desmond/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">183</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 185\r\n(1st Cir. 1995) (internal citations omitted) (citing In re Anolik,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1920399\"><a href=\"/opinion/1920399/in-re-anolik/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">426</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 429 (D. Mass. 1989) (collecting cases)); see also  In\r\nre Thrifty Liquors, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 28 (D. Mass. 1982) (\"The\r\nCourt is loath to interfere with the Trustee's business decision in\r\nregard to . . . the propriety of the proposed sale.\").\r\nIn deciding whether to approve a compromise of a lawsuit,\r\nthe specific factors a bankruptcy court should consider include:\r\n\"(i) the probability of success in the litigation being\r\ncompromised; (ii) the difficulties, if any, to be encountered in\r\nthe matter of collection; (iii) the complexity of the litigation\r\ninvolved, and the expense, inconvenience and delay attending it;\r\nand, (iv) the paramount interest of the creditors and a proper\r\ndeference to their reasonable views in the premise.\" See Jeffrey,\r\n70 F.3d at 185. The court's consideration of these factors should\r\ndemonstrate whether the compromise is fair and equitable, and\r\nwhether the claim the debtor is giving up is outweighed by the\r\nadvantage to the debtor's estate. Although Jeffrey involved a\r\nChapter 7 petition, courts routinely use these same principles in\r\nthe Chapter 11 context. See, e.g., In re Pennsylvania Truck Lines,\r\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1865789\"><a href=\"/opinion/1865789/in-re-pennsylvania-truck-lines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">595</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, (E.D. Pa. 1992).\r\nIn the instant case, the record amply demonstrates that\r\nthe court carefully weighed these factors in deciding to approve\r\nthe sale and compromise. The court did not act mechanistically or\r\nimpulsively. It realized that the Trustee assumed that the\r\nadversary litigation would not be complex and that he probably\r\nwould triumph. However, even if the Trustee were successful in the\r\nadversary proceeding, there was a substantial risk that RSS would\r\nretain a claim for \"at least $200,000 against the estate,\" the\r\namount it had paid the New Bedford Bank for an assignment of the\r\noriginal mortgage. The Jeremiahs, by contrast, did not address this\r\nconcern. Thus, because the Jeremiahs had no financial equity in the\r\nproperty and did not put forward a credible plan or offer, the\r\ndispositive issue for the court ultimately was whether the\r\ncompromise and sale were in the best interests of the estate. The\r\ncourt reasonably concluded that they were.\r\nAlthough the bankruptcy court was faced with some\r\nunsavory and troublesome circumstances, in reality, it had no\r\nchoice but to approve the proposal. Regardless of the court's\r\nreluctance to approve a sale of the property to a purchaser of\r\nquestionable repute and allegedly unethical conduct in the\r\nacquisition of the mortgage, any other decision might have been\r\ncostly to the estate and an abuse of the court's discretion. The\r\nCenter had been in and out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy for\r\napproximately nine years. A trustee had been appointed and was\r\nrunning the Center--extraordinary in a Chapter 11 proceeding, seeDavid G. Epstein, et al., Bankruptcy,  10.8, at 745 (1993)--\r\nbecause the Jeremiahs were in prison for dealing drugs out of the\r\nCenter and unavailable to run it themselves. There appeared to be\r\nno end in sight.\r\nThe Center also was woefully behind in its tax and\r\nutility payments. It had not made a real estate tax payment to the\r\nCity of Providence since 1989 and was subject to  real estate tax\r\nliens that were rapidly approaching $1 million. In addition, the\r\nProvidence Water Supply Board and the Narragansett Bay Commission\r\nheld $30,000 and $16,000 liens, respectively, on the property. The\r\nCenter also has at least $850,000 to $1.5 million worth of\r\nenvironmental problems, is in deteriorating condition, with the\r\nroof alone needing between a half million and $1 million worth of\r\nrepairs. In addition, prepetition, unsecured creditors held claims\r\nfor approximately another $75,000. Although the Trustee, in\r\noperating the Center, had an illusory \"profit\" of $5,000 per month,\r\nthis was achieved only by not making payments on the mortgage, and\r\nby withholding payment of real estate taxes and any payments\r\ntowards any of the Center's prepetition outstanding obligations.\r\nFurthermore, it appears that much-needed repairs and capital\r\nimprovements were ignored.\r\nSince the time the Jeremiahs sought Chapter 11 protection\r\nin 1994, they unfortunately never once put forward a credible\r\nproposal to reorganize the Center's debts and to resume its\r\noperation. Even their so-called \"proposal\" submitted at the March\r\n31st hearing lacked specific information regarding the value of the\r\nproposal, how it would be funded, or even the time frame during\r\nwhich it would be implemented. Furthermore, even the\r\nrepresentations of the Jeremiahs' counsel were lacking in\r\nspecifics, referring mostly to undocumented and unverifiable monies\r\nand assets to be pledged in the future. Moreover, after notice by\r\nthe Trustee of the proposed sale and compromise, no creditor\r\nobjected. In the end, after marketing efforts, the targeting of\r\nother potential buyers, and the holding of discussions with others,\r\nRicci made the only credible proposal. Faced with these facts,\r\nwhich are fully documented on the record, the court appears to have\r\nmade the only reasonable choice available in approving the proposed\r\nsale and compromise.\r\nFinally, although the court fully adopted the reasoning\r\nof the Trustee in its final order and judgment, it articulated some\r\nof its own reasons for approving the plan during the March 31st\r\nhearing.\r\n  In this case I welcome the Trustee's\r\nbusiness judgment test. I think I've heard\r\nabout as much as can be said in behalf of the\r\nJeremiahs and the debtor in this case. This is\r\na situation that no one in their right mind\r\ncould possibly like if they're looking at it\r\nfrom an objective position. It's been--it's\r\nbeen unpleasant. It's been questionable.\r\nEthics are totally missing--I don't know when\r\nthis--the whole thing originated, but it's\r\njust a [sic] unsavory situation that has come\r\ndown to the place where it is. [The debtor's\r\nattorney's] efforts to--in his client's\r\nbehalf--and nobody questions his right or his\r\nobligation to do that--would merely place us\r\nback where we were, moving along with the\r\nlitigation, before the Trustee comes up with\r\nthis offer. It's the only show in town. It's\r\nthe only viable show in town.\r\n\n(App. 141-42).\r\nIn sum, the court made an informed, reasoned, and\r\nindependent decision to approve, albeit reluctantly,  the\r\nTrustee'application to compromise and sale. We cannot conclude that\r\nit amounted to an abuse of the court's discretion.\r\n                          III.\r\nAccordingly, we hold that despite the debtor's\r\nallegations of fraud and unethical behavior leveled at the\r\npurchaser, the bankruptcy court's approval of the Trustee's sale\r\nand compromise did not amount to an abuse of the court's\r\ndiscretion. The court regrettably lacked a realistic alternative\r\nproposal and it fairly considered the merits of the proposal put\r\nforward by the Trustee and the realities of the estate's desperate\r\nsituation. The district court's judgment affirming the judgment of\r\nthe bankruptcy court is affirmed. Each side to bear its own costs.\r\n</pre>",
