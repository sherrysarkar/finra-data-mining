Frank H.

Walsh, Jr. for appellant.\n     Karen L. Goodwin, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, was on brief for\nappellee.\n\fMarch 2, 2001\n\f         CYR, Senior Circuit Judge.                  Plaintiff Wesley Walsh\n\nchallenges    the    summary   judgment       ruling    which   prompted    the\n\ndistrict court to dismiss his Federal Tort Claims Act (“FTCA”)\n\nsuit for compensatory damages associated with a “slip and fall”\n\non snow and ice outside the United States Post Office in East\n\nLongmeadow,   Massachusetts,      on       January   10,   1996,   during   the\n\nwaning hours of an extended snowstorm.                 Two days earlier, a\n\nblizzard had blanketed the area with approximately two feet of\n\nsnow, which was followed by a further accumulation the next day\n\nand windblown snow showers on the day of the accident.\n\n         The district court ruled that summary judgment was in\n\norder under the controlling Massachusetts caselaw, see Sullivan\n\nv. Town of Brookline, 416 Mass. 825, 827, 626 N.E.2d 870, 872\n\n(1994), absent evidence that the snow and ice at the accident\n\nsite was anything other than a “natural accumulation.”                       We\n\naffirm the judgment.\n\n\n                                       I\n\n                               BACKGROUND\n\n         According to Walsh, it was snowing as he exited his car\n\nto walk to the post office.       The snow on the sidewalk leading to\n\nthe post office was “packed down,” “very, very uneven,” and\n\n“discolored.“       Since the conditions appeared somewhat worse on\n\n\n\n                                       3\n\fthe sidewalk, Walsh decided to walk to the post office through\n\nthe adjacent parking lot.          He did so without incident.\n\n             Upon exiting the post office, however, Walsh chose to\n\nreturn to the car by way of the sidewalk, largely because it\n\nafforded a more direct route than the one he had taken earlier\n\nthrough the parking lot.           Moments later, at the point where a\n\nhandicap-access ramp meets the sidewalk and the sidewalk slopes\n\nslightly to accommodate wheelchairs, Walsh suddenly slipped, his\n\n“leg came right down underneath [him] and [he] went down full\n\nforce.”     Walsh could recall no preexisting footprints in the snow\n\nwhere he fell, nor had he noticed any difference between the\n\nconditions at the accident site than elsewhere along the route\n\nthrough the parking lot.\n\n\n                                         II\n\n                                   DISCUSSION\n\n             The FTCA subjects the United States to tort liability\n\n“in   the   same   manner    and    to   the   same   extent   as   a   private\n\nindividual under like circumstances . . . .”              28 U.S.C. § 2674.\n\nWell in advance of its reconfirmation by the Supreme Judicial\n\nCourt in 1994, see Sullivan, 416 Mass. 825, 626 N.E.2d 870, this\n\ncourt had concluded         that the “natural accumulation” doctrine\n\nremained alive and well in Massachusetts.              See Athas v. United\n\nStates, 904 F.2d 79, 82 (1st Cir. 1990) (failure of postal\n\n                                         4\n\femployees to remove water accumulation on post office steps,\n\nduring ongoing rainstorm, held insufficient to subject landowner\n\nto liability under Massachusetts law) (citing Lowe v. National\n\nShawmut Bank of Boston, 363 Mass. 74, 77, 292 N.E.2d 683, 685\n\n(1973); Wexler v. Stanetsky Mem’l Chapel of Brookline, Inc., 2\n\nMass. App. Ct. 750, 751, 321 N.E.2d 686, 687 (1975)).          Nor do we\n\ndiscern   any   material   change    in   the   “natural   accumulation”\n\ndoctrine since Athas.\n\n           The district court, quoting Sullivan, 416 Mass. at 827,\n\n626 N.E.2d at 872, ruled that “[h]ere, just as in Sullivan, ‘the\n\nplaintiff’s evidence tend[ing] to show that the shovelling of the\n\n[handicap access] ramp by the [post office] employees exposed ice\n\nthat was already there’ is insufficient to generate liability .\n\n. . .”    District Court Order, at 2 (quoting Sullivan, 416 Mass.\n\nat 827-28, 626 N.E.2d at 872).            The district court further\n\nobserved that, as in Sullivan, “there is ‘no evidence that the\n\nemployees’ shovelling altered the condition of the ice on the\n\n[handicap access] ramp.’      Id. (no liability where ‘a property\n\nowner removes a portion of an accumulation of snow or ice and a\n\nperson is injured by slipping and falling on the remainder\n\nbecause the snow or ice remains as a natural accumulation’).”\n\nId.\n\n\n                                    III\n\n                                     5\n\f                               CONCLUSION\n\n          As the district court correctly ruled that the United\n\nStates   was   entitled   to   summary   judgment   as   a   matter   of\n\nMassachusetts law, we affirm its judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                   6\n\f",
