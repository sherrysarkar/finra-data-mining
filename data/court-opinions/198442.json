Nevares with whom Gustavo A. Gelpi, John M. Garcia and\r\nIsabel Abislaiman for appellees.\r\n\nApril 21, 1999\r\n\nCOFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.  This case requires us to\r\nexamine once again the often difficult concept of \"under color of\r\nstate law\" as it relates to the death of a private individual at\r\nthe hands of police officers.  Plaintiffs, the widow and four\r\nchildren of Rembert Zambrana-Rodriguez (\"Zambrana\"), filed this\r\nlawsuit seeking damages under 42 U.S.C.  1983 and Puerto Rico law\r\nafter Zambrana died from injuries he suffered when two police\r\nofficers intervened in a fight at a bar. The district court granted\r\nsummary judgment for the defendants and dismissed the pendent state\r\nlaw claims, on the ground that the officers' conduct constituted\r\nprivate violence rather than violence \"under color of state law\" as\r\nrequired for liability under section 1983.  Our review of the\r\nrecord and case law persuades us that the issue should have gone to\r\nthe jury.  Accordingly, we vacate the judgment and remand for\r\nfurther proceedings.\r\n                     I. Background\r\nConsistent with our obligation in reviewing a grant of\r\nsummary judgment, we consider the facts in the light most favorable\r\nto the plaintiffs, the non-moving parties, and also draw all\r\nreasonable inferences in their favor.  See Barreto-Rivera v.\r\nMedina-Vargas, 168 F.3d 42, 44 (lst Cir. 1999).\r\nOn the night of June 10, 1993, Zambrana was socializing\r\nat Freddy's Pub in Carolina, Puerto Rico, when he insulted the\r\ngirlfriend of the bar's owner, Freddie Casablanca.  A verbal\r\nexchange between Zambrana and Casablanca quickly escalated into a\r\nphysical fight.  Other patrons in the crowded bar gathered around\r\nto watch, and some of them attempted to separate the two men. \r\nAmong those at the bar at the time were two police\r\nofficers, Carlos Suarez-Cruz (\"Suarez\") and Angel Rolon-Mercado\r\n(\"Rolon\"), who had been playing pool in an area somewhat removed\r\nfrom the site of the fight.  The officers had been together since\r\nshortly after ending their shift earlier that evening and had\r\nattended a birthday party for another officer before driving in\r\nSuarez's personal car to the pub.  The officers were partially in\r\nuniform, both wearing their police-issue pants and boots.  Rolon\r\nalso was wearing a t-shirt identified with the letters \"DOT,\" the\r\nSpanish acronym for the Tactical Operations Division of the police\r\ndepartment.  Both also were carrying their police-issue weapons,\r\npursuant to departmental regulations.\r\nRolon encountered the fight when he walked over to the\r\nbar to get more beer.  He returned initially to Suarez to tell him\r\nwhat was going on, and then went back to where the fight was taking\r\nplace, with Suarez following.  At this point, Casablanca and\r\nZambrana were on the floor; Zambrana was pulling Casablanca's neck\r\nchain, which was cutting the back of his neck and \"choking\" him,\r\nand Casablanca was trying to free himself.  When the two fighters\r\nrose to their feet, Rolon and Suarez entered the fray: Suarez\r\ngrabbed Zambrana by putting his arm around Zambrana's neck, \r\nforcing him to let go of Casablanca.  Other bystanders assisted\r\nCasablanca, who went to the bathroom to clean up.  Although\r\nCasablanca was no longer involved, the fracas continued.  As\r\nZambrana attempted to free himself from Suarez's hold, Rolon began\r\nhitting Zambrana with all available objects, including a pool cue\r\nand billiard ball, his boots and his service revolver.\r\nBy all accounts, Rolon's attack on Zambrana was\r\nexcessively vicious.  Suarez sent Rolon to retrieve handcuffs from\r\nthe officers' car, and Suarez managed to place them on Zambrana by\r\nsitting on top of him and pulling his arms behind his back.  One\r\nwitness stated that Rolon  told those gathered around the scene in\r\nthe bar not to intervene because he and Suarez were police\r\nofficers.  After Zambrana was handcuffed, Casablanca told Suarez\r\nto take the fight outside.  \r\nOnce outside, Rolon searched Zambrana and seized a small\r\npacket of cocaine from him.  The officers also took out his wallet\r\nand kept his ATM card.  Suarez and Rolon left the scene a short\r\ntime later, leaving Zambrana lying on the ground, seriously\r\ninjured.  Zambrana was taken home and, early the following morning,\r\nadmitted to the hospital.  He died two days later of kidney failure\r\ndue to bodily trauma.\r\nPlaintiffs filed a complaint under 42 U.S.C.  1983\r\nagainst Suarez and various of his supervisors, alleging that\r\nZambrana's civil and constitutional rights had been violated by the \r\nofficers' conduct.  Additional claims were asserted under Puerto\r\nRico law.  The defendants filed various motions to dismiss and for\r\nsummary judgment, and on March 31, 1998, the district court granted\r\nsummary judgment for all defendants based on its conclusion that\r\nplaintiffs had offered insufficient evidence to prove that Suarez\r\nand Rolon acted \"under color of law\" as required to establish a\r\nviolation of section 1983.  The court dismissed the pendent state\r\nlaw claims.  This appeal followed.\r\n                     II. Discussion\r\nA. Summary Judgment Standard\r\nA district court may grant summary judgment only \"if the\r\npleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions\r\non file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is\r\nno genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party\r\nis entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P.\r\n56(c).  Our review is de novo, and, as noted earlier, see supra at\r\n2, we evaluate the record in the light most favorable to the non-\r\nmoving party, in this case the plaintiffs.  Summary judgment is\r\nappropriate only if the evidence taken in that light \"fails to\r\nyield a trialworthy issue as to some material fact.\"  Martinez v.\r\nColon, 54 F.3d 980, 983-84 (lst Cir. 1995).  Otherwise stated, our\r\ntask is to determine \"whether the evidence presents a sufficient\r\ndisagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so\r\none-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.\" \r\nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 251-52 (1986).\r\nIn this specific case, that obligation is to decide\r\nwhether a jury could find that Suarez and Rolon acted \"under color\r\nof state law\" when they intervened in Zambrana's fight with\r\nCasablanca and administered the blows that led to Zambrana's death.\r\n  B. Under Color of State Law\r\nEstablishing that the defendant acted \"under color of\r\nstate law\" is one of two essential requirements for an action under\r\nsection 1983, which imposes liability only for conduct \r\nattributable to the state.  In distinguishing private action from\r\nstate action, the general inquiry is whether \"a state actor's\r\nconduct occurs in the course of performing an actual or apparent\r\nduty of his office, or . . . is such that the actor could not have\r\nbehaved in that way but for the authority of his office.\" \r\nMartinez, 54 F.3d at 986.  The concept can be particularly elusive\r\nwhen applied to police conduct, as we have recognized in three\r\nrecent cases.  See Barreto-Rivera, 168 F.3d at 45-46; Parilla-\r\nBurgos v. Hernandez-Rivera, 108 F.3d 445, 448-50 (lst Cir. 1997);\r\nMartinez, 54 F.3d at 986-87.  We quote from Barreto-Rivera:\r\nNo single, easily determinable factor will\r\ncontrol whether a police officer was acting\r\nunder state law.  While certain factors will\r\ncertainly be relevant   for example, a police\r\nofficer's garb, an officer's duty status, the\r\nofficer's use of a service revolver, and the\r\nlocation of the incident   these factors must\r\nnot be assessed mechanically.\r\n\n168 F.3d at 45 (citation omitted).\r\n\nResolving the \"under color of law\" question therefore\r\nrequires an assessment of the totality of the circumstances, in\r\nwhich we must consider both \"'the nature and circumstances of the\r\nofficer's conduct and the relationship of that conduct to the\r\nperformance of his official duties.'\"  Barreto-Rivera, 168 F.3d at\r\n46 (quoting Martinez, 54 F.3d at 986-87); see also Parilla-Burgos,\r\n108 F.3d at 449.  The determination does not turn on \"whether an\r\nofficer stays strictly within the line of duty, or oversteps it.\" \r\nMartinez, 54 F.3d at 986.  An officer who abuses or exceeds his\r\nrecognized authority may be acting under color of law if, \"at the\r\ntime in question, [he] purposes to act in an official capacity or\r\nto exercise official responsibilities pursuant to state law.\"  Id. \r\nAlthough the subjective reactions of the victim may have some\r\nrelevance, \"the primary focus of the color of law analysis must be\r\non the conduct of the police officer,\" Barreto-Rivera, 168 F.3d at\r\n47, and whether it \"related in some meaningful way either to the\r\nofficer's governmental status or to the performance of his duties,\"\r\nMartinez, 54 F.3d at 987.\r\nIn both Martinez and Parilla-Burgos, the application of\r\nthese principles led us to uphold district court summary judgment\r\nrulings that the plaintiffs had failed to establish that the\r\ndefendant police officers acted \"under color of state law.\"  In\r\nMartinez, an on-shift police officer accidentally shot and maimed\r\na fellow off-shift officer after repeatedly harassing that officer\r\nin the station house.  Although he was in uniform and armed with\r\nhis service revolver, the harassing officer never asserted his\r\nauthority as a police officer.  We concluded that he \"was bent on\r\na singularly personal frolic: tormenting an acquaintance.  Though\r\non duty and in uniform, [the officer's] status as a police officer\r\nsimply did not enter into his benighted harassment of his fellow\r\nofficer,\" Martinez, 54 F.3d at 987 (footnote omitted).\r\nThe facts in Parilla-Burgos more closely resemble those\r\nbefore us.  In that case, an off-shift police officer using his\r\nservice revolver fatally shot a fellow bar patron.  The officer,\r\nwho was on medical leave and not in his uniform, had encountered\r\nthe decedent at the bar, telling him: \"I'll look at you whichever\r\nway I please, because I am a cop.\"  See 108 F.3d at 447.  The\r\nexchange escalated and the officer repeated his claim to special\r\nstatus: \"I look at anybody I want, because I'm a cop.  Anybody I\r\ndecide I want to look at dirty, I look at them dirty.\"  See id. \r\nThe officer apparently displayed his identification to the crowd\r\ngathered around, telling the onlookers that he was there to keep\r\nthe peace.  That statement stopped the fracas briefly, but it soon\r\nresumed, and the decedent challenged the officer to step outside\r\nwithout his gun.  The officer responded, \"I don't need a gun to\r\nfight you,\" but he nevertheless took the gun with him when the two\r\nmen left the bar.  Moments into the fight, the officer pulled out\r\nhis weapon and fired the six shots that killed the decedent.\r\nWe concluded that, despite the officer's comment that he\r\nwas in the bar to keep peace and his showing of police\r\nidentification, the officer's conduct demonstrated that he was\r\nacting in a private capacity.  See id. at 450.  We observed that\r\nstatements such as those by the officer claiming a special\r\nprivilege to \"look dirty\" at an individual by virtue of his\r\nposition as a police officer \"do not constitute action under color\r\nor pretense of state law if the asserted privilege lies clearly\r\noutside the scope of their official duties.\"  Id. at 451.  Weighing\r\nheavily in our decision was that the final exchange between the\r\nofficer and the decedent before they left the bar amounted to an\r\ninvitation and acceptance to engage in a private brawl, after which\r\nthe officer made no further pretense of official action.  SeeBarreto-Rivera, 168 F.3d at 46; Parilla-Burgos, 108 F.3d at 450-51.\r\nWe found the pre-trial evidence less decisive in Barreto-\r\nRivera.  The episode there began when the defendant officer,\r\ndriving in his cruiser, followed the decedent as he drove home from\r\na local store.  When they reached the house, the officer demanded\r\nthe decedent's license and registration.  A verbal exchange\r\noccurred outside the home, during which the decedent accused the\r\nofficer of making a pass at his wife.  The two men exchanged\r\npunches and the officer repeatedly hit the decedent with his night\r\nstick before the pair was separated and the decedent went into the\r\nhouse.  At that point, two of the decedent's family members\r\napproached the officer and were pushed and shoved by him.  Seeing\r\nthe conflict, the decedent came out of the house, picked up a piece\r\nof plastic tube from his yard, and approached the officer. \r\nAlthough several witnesses took the tubing from the decedent, the\r\nofficer radioed for back-up help, stating: \"10-50, I have been\r\nattacked.  Hurry up, this guy is acting tough and I am going to\r\nhave to shoot him.\" 168 F.3d at 44.  The decedent told the officer\r\nto drop his gun and fight with his fists.  The officer responded by\r\ntelling the decedent not to come any closer or he would shoot.  The\r\ndecedent continued to approach, and the officer fatally shot him.\r\nThe district court in Barreto-Rivera relied on deposition\r\ntestimony to conclude that the officer's encounter with the\r\ndecedent stemmed from a \"love feud\" and that his behavior and the\r\nshooting consequently were acts of a personal nature.  See id. at \r\n47.  The district court equated the showdown to the \"private brawl\"\r\nin Parilla-Burgos, observing that the officer's call for back up on\r\nhis police radio in the final moments of the confrontation   a\r\nseemingly official act   might have been designed to set up a claim\r\nof self-defense for his plan to shoot the decedent.  The court\r\nfound it significant that the decedent's \"actions were `not the\r\nacts of a person heeding another's status as a policeman; instead,\r\nthey reflect [the decedent's] total disregard for [the officer's]\r\nofficial position.'\" Id.\r\nOn review, however, we held that the facts and possible\r\ninferences did not lead inexorably to a finding of private conduct. \r\nWe discounted the decedent's subjective reactions to the\r\nconfrontation and noted numerous indicators of official action: the\r\nofficer was on duty, in uniform, patrolling in his cruiser, and he\r\nrelied on his authority as a police officer to stop the decedent\r\nand demand his license and registration.  We further observed that\r\nthe officer used his nightstick   \"a police-issued weapon and a\r\npotent symbol of police authority\"   against the decedent, that the\r\nofficer summoned help on his police radio, and ultimately shot and\r\nkilled the decedent with his service revolver. Id. at 48.  In such\r\ncircumstances, we were \"unwilling to say that [the officer's]\r\nconduct was so clearly personal in nature that a jury could reach\r\nonly one outcome.\"  Id.  We therefore vacated the judgment for\r\ndefendants.\r\nC. Applying the Standard\r\nIn its assessment of the circumstances before us, the\r\ndistrict court highlighted testimony that Rolon had \"excitedly\"\r\njoined in the fight, which indicated to the court a desire to\r\nparticipate rather than to establish order.  The court also pointed\r\nto Rolon's \"brutal and random attack of Zambrana . . . and his\r\ndecision to steal his wallet.\"  At the same time, the court\r\ndownplayed the officers' use of official measures, particularly the\r\nhandcuffs and search of Zambrana, observing that these techniques\r\nwere not used for the usual purposes of facilitating an arrest or\r\nchecking for weapons or contraband.  In the court's view, the\r\ntotality of the circumstances showed that \"[m]ore likely than not,\r\ntheir conduct consisted of private violence engaged in by two\r\nindividuals who happened to work for the state . . . .\"\r\nThough we acknowledge that this is one plausible reading\r\nof the evidence, we are unpersuaded that it is the only one.  We\r\nbelieve that the record contains sufficient indicia of official\r\npolice action that a jury reviewing the \"nature and circumstances\"\r\nof Suarez and Rolon's conduct and the \"relationship of that conduct\r\nto the performance of [their] official duties,\" see Martinez, 54\r\nF.3d at 986, could conclude that they acted under color of state\r\nlaw, albeit in clear abuse of their authority.\r\nWe begin our discussion of the evidence by noting a\r\nsignificant difference between the circumstances here and those in\r\nall three of the earlier cases discussed above.  In Martinez,\r\nParilla-Burgos and Barreto-Rivera, the injury and deaths arose out\r\nof incidents in which the police officers were original\r\nparticipants.  Here, by contrast, Rolon and Suarez entered an\r\nalready developed dispute between two private individuals, and\r\ntheir action in helping to pull Zambrana and Casablanca apart was\r\nconsistent with the responsibility of police officers to defuse\r\nviolent situations.  That Rolon's intervention quickly turned\r\nbrutal and inappropriate does not negate the possibility that this\r\nwas an official action.  Nor does the testimony noted by the\r\ndistrict court describing Rolon as \"excitedly\" entering the fight. \r\nThe actual testimony did not, in fact, describe Rolon as \"excited.\" \r\nSuarez was asked in his deposition whether Rolon became involved\r\n\"because of the excitement,\" and he answered \"yes.\"  Read in a\r\nlight most favorable to plaintiffs, Suarez's testimony may simply\r\nhave indicated that the commotion caused by the fight prompted\r\nRolon to step in.\r\nThe evidence contained a number of additional indicators\r\nof official action: Rolon's telling onlookers to stay away because\r\nhe and Suarez were police officers; the use of handcuffs to subdue\r\nZambrana; the search of Zambrana and seizure of cocaine; and a\r\nstatement by Suarez to a friend of Zambrana's that he planned to\r\npursue drug and possibly other charges against Zambrana. \r\nMoreover, unlike in Parilla-Burgos, where the officer's assertion\r\nof special status occurred only in the opening minutes of the\r\nepisode, the indicia of official conduct here spanned the entire\r\ninteraction, ending with the search and seizure. \r\nTaken together, these circumstances permit a judgment\r\nthat Suarez and Rolon took control of the Zambrana/Casablanca fight\r\nin furtherance of their duty as police officers and for the purpose\r\nof ending the disturbance; that they did so in part through Rolon's\r\nabuse of his police power and in part through the use of a\r\ntraditional law enforcement tool, the handcuffs; and that the\r\nsearch of Zambrana was conducted under the apparent authority of\r\nthe officers' official status.  Even if Suarez and Rolon's purpose\r\nin searching Zambrana was to steal whatever they could from him, we\r\nbelieve a jury could conclude that their actions were taken under\r\ncolor of law because they were enabled by their status as police\r\nofficers.  As noted earlier, an individual's conduct is\r\nattributable to the state not only if it arises from the\r\nperformance of actual duties but also if it occurs in the course of\r\nperforming an apparent duty of his office, or \"is such that the\r\nactor could not have behaved in that way but for the authority of\r\nhis office.\"  Martinez, 54 F.3d at 986.  Cf. Stengel v. Belcher,\r\n522 F.2d 438, 440-41 (6th Cir. 1975).\r\nIn sum, we think there was enough here to warrant putting\r\nthe question to the jury.  Indeed, the district court, evidently\r\nrecognizing that the evidence tipped in both directions, phrased\r\nits conclusions in language undermining its conclusion that summary\r\njudgment was appropriate; rather than stating that the evidence\r\ncould lead to but one result, the court observed that \"[m]ost\r\nprobably, Rolon and Suarez's motive was purely criminal in\r\nnature,\" and \"[m]ore likely than not,\" their conduct consisted of\r\nprivate violence.  A conclusion that the dispositive fact is more\r\nlikely than not is inconsistent with the standard for summary\r\njudgment.\r\nAs in Barreto-Rivera, the court appears to have\r\nimproperly engaged in its own weighing of the evidence, failing to\r\ngive the plaintiffs the benefit of all inferences to be drawn from\r\nthe available facts.  See 168 F.3d at 47.  We therefore vacate its\r\nentry of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings on\r\nplaintiffs' section 1983 claim.\r\nD. Pendent Claims\r\nThe district court declined to exercise jurisdiction over\r\nplaintiffs' pendent Commonwealth law claims because of its\r\ndismissal of the section 1983 claim.  In light of our disposition\r\non the federal civil rights claim, we vacate dismissal of the\r\npendent claims and remand those as well for further attention by\r\nthe district court.\r\nVacated and remanded.\r\n",

As\r\nZambrana attempted to free himself from Suarez's hold, Rolon began\r\nhitting Zambrana with all available objects, including a pool cue\r\nand billiard ball, his boots and his service revolver.\r\nBy all accounts, Rolon's attack on Zambrana was\r\nexcessively vicious.  Suarez sent Rolon to retrieve handcuffs from\r\nthe officers' car, and Suarez managed to place them on Zambrana by\r\nsitting on top of him and pulling his arms behind his back.  One\r\nwitness stated that Rolon  told those gathered around the scene in\r\nthe bar not to intervene because he and Suarez were police\r\nofficers.  After Zambrana was handcuffed, Casablanca told Suarez\r\nto take the fight outside.  \r\nOnce outside, Rolon searched Zambrana and seized a small\r\npacket of cocaine from him.  The officers also took out his wallet\r\nand kept his ATM card.  Suarez and Rolon left the scene a short\r\ntime later, leaving Zambrana lying on the ground, seriously\r\ninjured.  Zambrana was taken home and, early the following morning,\r\nadmitted to the hospital.  He died two days later of kidney failure\r\ndue to bodily trauma.\r\nPlaintiffs filed a complaint under 42 U.S.C.  1983\r\nagainst Suarez and various of his supervisors, alleging that\r\nZambrana's civil and constitutional rights had been violated by the \r\nofficers' conduct.  Additional claims were asserted under Puerto\r\nRico law.  The defendants filed various motions to dismiss and for\r\nsummary judgment, and on March 31, 1998, the district court granted\r\nsummary judgment for all defendants based on its conclusion that\r\nplaintiffs had offered insufficient evidence to prove that Suarez\r\nand Rolon acted \"under color of law\" as required to establish a\r\nviolation of section 1983.  The court dismissed the pendent state\r\nlaw claims.  This appeal followed.\r\n                     II. Discussion\r\nA. Summary Judgment Standard\r\nA district court may grant summary judgment only \"if the\r\npleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions\r\non file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is\r\nno genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party\r\nis entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P.\r\n56(c).  Our review is de novo, and, as noted earlier, see supra at\r\n2, we evaluate the record in the light most favorable to the non-\r\nmoving party, in this case the plaintiffs.  Summary judgment is\r\nappropriate only if the evidence taken in that light \"fails to\r\nyield a trialworthy issue as to some material fact.\"  Martinez v.\r\nColon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"696203\"><a href=\"/opinion/696203/wilfredo-martinez-aka-wilfredo-martinez-rodriguez-v-rafael-colon-aka/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">980</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 983-84 (lst Cir. 1995).  Otherwise stated, our\r\ntask is to determine \"whether the evidence presents a sufficient\r\ndisagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so\r\none-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.\" \r\nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111719\"><a href=\"/opinion/111719/anderson-v-liberty-lobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 251-52 (1986).\r\nIn this specific case, that obligation is to decide\r\nwhether a jury could find that Suarez and Rolon acted \"under color\r\nof state law\" when they intervened in Zambrana's fight with\r\nCasablanca and administered the blows that led to Zambrana's death.\r\n  B. Under Color of State Law\r\nEstablishing that the defendant acted \"under color of\r\nstate law\" is one of two essential requirements for an action under\r\nsection 1983, which imposes liability only for conduct \r\nattributable to the state.  In distinguishing private action from\r\nstate action, the general inquiry is whether \"a state actor's\r\nconduct occurs in the course of performing an actual or apparent\r\nduty of his office, or . . . is such that the actor could not have\r\nbehaved in that way but for the authority of his office.\" \r\nMartinez, 54 F.3d at 986.  The concept can be particularly elusive\r\nwhen applied to police conduct, as we have recognized in three\r\nrecent cases.  See Barreto-Rivera, 168 F.3d at 45-46; Parilla-\r\nBurgos v. Hernandez-Rivera, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197257\"><a href=\"/opinion/197257/parrilla-burgos-v-hernandez-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 448-50 (lst Cir. 1997);\r\nMartinez, 54 F.3d at 986-87.  We quote from Barreto-Rivera:\r\nNo single, easily determinable factor will\r\ncontrol whether a police officer was acting\r\nunder state law.  While certain factors will\r\ncertainly be relevant   for example, a police\r\nofficer's garb, an officer's duty status, the\r\nofficer's use of a service revolver, and the\r\nlocation of the incident   these factors must\r\nnot be assessed mechanically.\r\n\n168 F.3d at 45 (citation omitted).\r\n\nResolving the \"under color of law\" question therefore\r\nrequires an assessment of the totality of the circumstances, in\r\nwhich we must consider both \"'the nature and circumstances of the\r\nofficer's conduct and the relationship of that conduct to the\r\nperformance of his official duties.'\"  Barreto-Rivera, 168 F.3d at\r\n46 (quoting Martinez, 54 F.3d at 986-87); see also Parilla-Burgos,\r\n108 F.3d at 449.  The determination does not turn on \"whether an\r\nofficer stays strictly within the line of duty, or oversteps it.\" \r\nMartinez, 54 F.3d at 986.  An officer who abuses or exceeds his\r\nrecognized authority may be acting under color of law if, \"at the\r\ntime in question, [he] purposes to act in an official capacity or\r\nto exercise official responsibilities pursuant to state law.\"  Id. \r\nAlthough the subjective reactions of the victim may have some\r\nrelevance, \"the primary focus of the color of law analysis must be\r\non the conduct of the police officer,\" Barreto-Rivera, 168 F.3d at\r\n47, and whether it \"related in some meaningful way either to the\r\nofficer's governmental status or to the performance of his duties,\"\r\nMartinez, 54 F.3d at 987.\r\nIn both Martinez and Parilla-Burgos, the application of\r\nthese principles led us to uphold district court summary judgment\r\nrulings that the plaintiffs had failed to establish that the\r\ndefendant police officers acted \"under color of state law.\"  In\r\nMartinez, an on-shift police officer accidentally shot and maimed\r\na fellow off-shift officer after repeatedly harassing that officer\r\nin the station house.  Although he was in uniform and armed with\r\nhis service revolver, the harassing officer never asserted his\r\nauthority as a police officer.  We concluded that he \"was bent on\r\na singularly personal frolic: tormenting an acquaintance.  Though\r\non duty and in uniform, [the officer's] status as a police officer\r\nsimply did not enter into his benighted harassment of his fellow\r\nofficer,\" Martinez, 54 F.3d at 987 (footnote omitted).\r\nThe facts in Parilla-Burgos more closely resemble those\r\nbefore us.  In that case, an off-shift police officer using his\r\nservice revolver fatally shot a fellow bar patron.  The officer,\r\nwho was on medical leave and not in his uniform, had encountered\r\nthe decedent at the bar, telling him: \"I'll look at you whichever\r\nway I please, because I am a cop.\"  See 108 F.3d at 447.  The\r\nexchange escalated and the officer repeated his claim to special\r\nstatus: \"I look at anybody I want, because I'm a cop.  Anybody I\r\ndecide I want to look at dirty, I look at them dirty.\"  See id. \r\nThe officer apparently displayed his identification to the crowd\r\ngathered around, telling the onlookers that he was there to keep\r\nthe peace.  That statement stopped the fracas briefly, but it soon\r\nresumed, and the decedent challenged the officer to step outside\r\nwithout his gun.  The officer responded, \"I don't need a gun to\r\nfight you,\" but he nevertheless took the gun with him when the two\r\nmen left the bar.  Moments into the fight, the officer pulled out\r\nhis weapon and fired the six shots that killed the decedent.\r\nWe concluded that, despite the officer's comment that he\r\nwas in the bar to keep peace and his showing of police\r\nidentification, the officer's conduct demonstrated that he was\r\nacting in a private capacity.  See id. at 450.  We observed that\r\nstatements such as those by the officer claiming a special\r\nprivilege to \"look dirty\" at an individual by virtue of his\r\nposition as a police officer \"do not constitute action under color\r\nor pretense of state law if the asserted privilege lies clearly\r\noutside the scope of their official duties.\"  Id. at 451.  Weighing\r\nheavily in our decision was that the final exchange between the\r\nofficer and the decedent before they left the bar amounted to an\r\ninvitation and acceptance to engage in a private brawl, after which\r\nthe officer made no further pretense of official action.  SeeBarreto-Rivera, 168 F.3d at 46; Parilla-Burgos, 108 F.3d at 450-51.\r\nWe found the pre-trial evidence less decisive in Barreto-\r\nRivera.  The episode there began when the defendant officer,\r\ndriving in his cruiser, followed the decedent as he drove home from\r\na local store.  When they reached the house, the officer demanded\r\nthe decedent's license and registration.  A verbal exchange\r\noccurred outside the home, during which the decedent accused the\r\nofficer of making a pass at his wife.  The two men exchanged\r\npunches and the officer repeatedly hit the decedent with his night\r\nstick before the pair was separated and the decedent went into the\r\nhouse.  At that point, two of the decedent's family members\r\napproached the officer and were pushed and shoved by him.  Seeing\r\nthe conflict, the decedent came out of the house, picked up a piece\r\nof plastic tube from his yard, and approached the officer. \r\nAlthough several witnesses took the tubing from the decedent, the\r\nofficer radioed for back-up help, stating: \"10-50, I have been\r\nattacked.  Hurry up, this guy is acting tough and I am going to\r\nhave to shoot him.\" 168 F.3d at 44.  The decedent told the officer\r\nto drop his gun and fight with his fists.  The officer responded by\r\ntelling the decedent not to come any closer or he would shoot.  The\r\ndecedent continued to approach, and the officer fatally shot him.\r\nThe district court in Barreto-Rivera relied on deposition\r\ntestimony to conclude that the officer's encounter with the\r\ndecedent stemmed from a \"love feud\" and that his behavior and the\r\nshooting consequently were acts of a personal nature.  See id. at \r\n47.  The district court equated the showdown to the \"private brawl\"\r\nin Parilla-Burgos, observing that the officer's call for back up on\r\nhis police radio in the final moments of the confrontation   a\r\nseemingly official act   might have been designed to set up a claim\r\nof self-defense for his plan to shoot the decedent.  The court\r\nfound it significant that the decedent's \"actions were `not the\r\nacts of a person heeding another's status as a policeman; instead,\r\nthey reflect [the decedent's] total disregard for [the officer's]\r\nofficial position.'\" Id.\r\nOn review, however, we held that the facts and possible\r\ninferences did not lead inexorably to a finding of private conduct. \r\nWe discounted the decedent's subjective reactions to the\r\nconfrontation and noted numerous indicators of official action: the\r\nofficer was on duty, in uniform, patrolling in his cruiser, and he\r\nrelied on his authority as a police officer to stop the decedent\r\nand demand his license and registration.  We further observed that\r\nthe officer used his nightstick   \"a police-issued weapon and a\r\npotent symbol of police authority\"   against the decedent, that the\r\nofficer summoned help on his police radio, and ultimately shot and\r\nkilled the decedent with his service revolver. Id. at 48.  In such\r\ncircumstances, we were \"unwilling to say that [the officer's]\r\nconduct was so clearly personal in nature that a jury could reach\r\nonly one outcome.\"  Id.  We therefore vacated the judgment for\r\ndefendants.\r\nC. Applying the Standard\r\nIn its assessment of the circumstances before us, the\r\ndistrict court highlighted testimony that Rolon had \"excitedly\"\r\njoined in the fight, which indicated to the court a desire to\r\nparticipate rather than to establish order.  The court also pointed\r\nto Rolon's \"brutal and random attack of Zambrana . . . and his\r\ndecision to steal his wallet.\"  At the same time, the court\r\ndownplayed the officers' use of official measures, particularly the\r\nhandcuffs and search of Zambrana, observing that these techniques\r\nwere not used for the usual purposes of facilitating an arrest or\r\nchecking for weapons or contraband.  In the court's view, the\r\ntotality of the circumstances showed that \"[m]ore likely than not,\r\ntheir conduct consisted of private violence engaged in by two\r\nindividuals who happened to work for the state . . . .\"\r\nThough we acknowledge that this is one plausible reading\r\nof the evidence, we are unpersuaded that it is the only one.  We\r\nbelieve that the record contains sufficient indicia of official\r\npolice action that a jury reviewing the \"nature and circumstances\"\r\nof Suarez and Rolon's conduct and the \"relationship of that conduct\r\nto the performance of [their] official duties,\" see Martinez, 54\r\nF.3d at 986, could conclude that they acted under color of state\r\nlaw, albeit in clear abuse of their authority.\r\nWe begin our discussion of the evidence by noting a\r\nsignificant difference between the circumstances here and those in\r\nall three of the earlier cases discussed above.  In Martinez,\r\nParilla-Burgos and Barreto-Rivera, the injury and deaths arose out\r\nof incidents in which the police officers were original\r\nparticipants.  Here, by contrast, Rolon and Suarez entered an\r\nalready developed dispute between two private individuals, and\r\ntheir action in helping to pull Zambrana and Casablanca apart was\r\nconsistent with the responsibility of police officers to defuse\r\nviolent situations.  That Rolon's intervention quickly turned\r\nbrutal and inappropriate does not negate the possibility that this\r\nwas an official action.  Nor does the testimony noted by the\r\ndistrict court describing Rolon as \"excitedly\" entering the fight. \r\nThe actual testimony did not, in fact, describe Rolon as \"excited.\" \r\nSuarez was asked in his deposition whether Rolon became involved\r\n\"because of the excitement,\" and he answered \"yes.\"  Read in a\r\nlight most favorable to plaintiffs, Suarez's testimony may simply\r\nhave indicated that the commotion caused by the fight prompted\r\nRolon to step in.\r\nThe evidence contained a number of additional indicators\r\nof official action: Rolon's telling onlookers to stay away because\r\nhe and Suarez were police officers; the use of handcuffs to subdue\r\nZambrana; the search of Zambrana and seizure of cocaine; and a\r\nstatement by Suarez to a friend of Zambrana's that he planned to\r\npursue drug and possibly other charges against Zambrana. \r\nMoreover, unlike in Parilla-Burgos, where the officer's assertion\r\nof special status occurred only in the opening minutes of the\r\nepisode, the indicia of official conduct here spanned the entire\r\ninteraction, ending with the search and seizure. \r\nTaken together, these circumstances permit a judgment\r\nthat Suarez and Rolon took control of the Zambrana/Casablanca fight\r\nin furtherance of their duty as police officers and for the purpose\r\nof ending the disturbance; that they did so in part through Rolon's\r\nabuse of his police power and in part through the use of a\r\ntraditional law enforcement tool, the handcuffs; and that the\r\nsearch of Zambrana was conducted under the apparent authority of\r\nthe officers' official status.  Even if Suarez and Rolon's purpose\r\nin searching Zambrana was to steal whatever they could from him, we\r\nbelieve a jury could conclude that their actions were taken under\r\ncolor of law because they were enabled by their status as police\r\nofficers.  As noted earlier, an individual's conduct is\r\nattributable to the state not only if it arises from the\r\nperformance of actual duties but also if it occurs in the course of\r\nperforming an apparent duty of his office, or \"is such that the\r\nactor could not have behaved in that way but for the authority of\r\nhis office.\"  Martinez, 54 F.3d at 986.  Cf. Stengel v. Belcher,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"330000\"><a href=\"/opinion/330000/casey-d-stengel-v-raymond-l-belcher-individually-and-as-a-police/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">438</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 440-41 (6th Cir. 1975).\r\nIn sum, we think there was enough here to warrant putting\r\nthe question to the jury.  Indeed, the district court, evidently\r\nrecognizing that the evidence tipped in both directions, phrased\r\nits conclusions in language undermining its conclusion that summary\r\njudgment was appropriate; rather than stating that the evidence\r\ncould lead to but one result, the court observed that \"[m]ost\r\nprobably, Rolon and Suarez's motive was purely criminal in\r\nnature,\" and \"[m]ore likely than not,\" their conduct consisted of\r\nprivate violence.  A conclusion that the dispositive fact is more\r\nlikely than not is inconsistent with the standard for summary\r\njudgment.\r\nAs in Barreto-Rivera, the court appears to have\r\nimproperly engaged in its own weighing of the evidence, failing to\r\ngive the plaintiffs the benefit of all inferences to be drawn from\r\nthe available facts.  See 168 F.3d at 47.  We therefore vacate its\r\nentry of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings on\r\nplaintiffs' section 1983 claim.\r\nD. Pendent Claims\r\nThe district court declined to exercise jurisdiction over\r\nplaintiffs' pendent Commonwealth law claims because of its\r\ndismissal of the section 1983 claim.  In light of our disposition\r\non the federal civil rights claim, we vacate dismissal of the\r\npendent claims and remand those as well for further attention by\r\nthe district court.\r\nVacated and remanded.\r\n</pre>",
