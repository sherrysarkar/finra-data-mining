The plaintiffs, J.  Donald and\r                                       \r\n\nSandra Robson, brought suit against Gilman Hallenbeck and Dan\r\n\nDiCarlo,  alleging  that  the defendants  breached  fiduciary\r\n\nduties owed to the Robsons, administered a trust in a grossly\r\n\nnegligent manner, and  committed fraud.  The  details of this\r\n\naction need  not be discussed,  since the principal  issue in\r\n\nthe  plaintiffs'  appeal is  procedural  and  we decline  the\r\n\ndefendants' invitation  to reach  the merits on  their cross-\r\n\nappeal.   But  because the  case was ultimately  dismissed on\r\n\naccount of the plaintiffs' conduct in pre-trial  proceedings,\r\n\na  description of the events  leading up to  the dismissal is\r\n\nrequired.\r\n\n     At  a pre-trial  conference on  September 30,  1994, the\r\n\ndistrict judge entered an order  that required the parties to\r\n\nmeet a  series of deadlines  in preparation for  trial, which\r\n\nwas set for May 1, 1995:\r\n\n           By April 10, 1995, the parties were to file a\r\n     stipulation of uncontested  facts, together with  a\r\n     statement  of issues  to  be tried  and  a list  of\r\n     witnesses for each side.\r\n\n           By April 17, the parties were to submit lists\r\n     of proposed exhibits.\r\n\n           By April 24, the parties were to file notices\r\n     of  any objections  to proposed exhibits  or expert\r\n     witnesses.\r\n\nThe parties were also directed  to make exhibits available to\r\n\nthe opposing party for  inspection, to file a trial  brief by\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nthe day of trial, and to file requests for rulings  of law on\r\n\nthe day of trial.\r\n\n     The  plaintiffs'  attorney,  Michael Phelan,  failed  to\r\n\nattend  the September 1994 pre-trial conference, but received\r\n\nnotice of the  order and its timetable.   Under circumstances\r\n\ndescribed  more fully below, the plaintiffs  did not meet the\r\n\nApril 10  deadline for filing the  stipulation of uncontested\r\n\nfacts.  The plaintiffs also failed to file a list of proposed\r\n\nexhibits  by  April  17.   The  parties  dispute  whether the\r\n\nplaintiffs  made  their  exhibits  available  for  review  by\r\n\ndefense  counsel  reasonably  in  advance of  April  24,  the\r\n\ndeadline   for  filing   objections  to   proposed  exhibits.\r\n\nFinally, the  plaintiffs filed their requests  for rulings of\r\n\nlaw on May 9, eight days late.\r\n\n     On  May  1,  when  the  trial  was  scheduled to  begin,\r\n\nattorney  Phelan  appeared  in  court  15  minutes  late  and\r\n\ndiscovered that the judge had already dismissed the case with\r\n\nprejudice for  failure to  comply with the  court's pre-trial\r\n\norder.  The plaintiffs  filed a motion to vacate the order of\r\n\ndismissal; the  district judge  denied it without  opinion on\r\n\nMay 24,  1995.  On  June 22, 1995,  the judge denied  without\r\n\nopinion the plaintiffs' motion  to reconsider their motion to\r\n\nvacate.\r\n\n     On  appeal, the  Robsons argue  that the  district court\r\n\nabused its  discretion in  dismissing the case  because their\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nactions did  not amount  to \"extreme\" misconduct,  see Enlace\r                                                                         \r\n\nMercantil  Internacional v. Senior  Industries, 848 F.2d 315,\r                                                          \r\n\n317 (1st  Cir. 1988),  that any  violations of  the pre-trial\r\n\norder were excusable and  did not prejudice the court  or the\r\n\ndefendants,  and  that  a  lesser sanction  would  have  been\r\n\nappropriate.\r\n\n     It is hard to find an area of law in which the governing\r\n\nrules are, and probably  have to be, so vague.  Admittedly, a\r\n\ndistrict  court  has  broad  authority  to enforce  pre-trial\r\n\ndiscipline and to  dismiss a  case for failure  to obey  pre-\r\n\ntrial orders.   Fed.  R. Civ.  P. 16(f),  41(b); see  Link v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nWabash  Railroad Co., 370 U.S. 626 (1962).  The difficulty is\r                                \r\n\nthat  the range of circumstances is so vast, and the problems\r\n\nso much matters of degree, as to defy mechanical rules.  What\r\n\nthe cases,  taken together,  do  is to  set forth  a list  of\r\n\npertinent considerations.\r\n\n     Among  those  commonly  mentioned  (this  list  is   not\r\n\ncomplete) are  the severity of the  violation, the legitimacy\r\n\nof  the  party's  excuse,   repetition  of  violations,   the\r\n\ndeliberateness vel non of the misconduct, mitigating excuses,\r                                  \r\n\nprejudice  to the  other side  and to  the operations  of the\r\n\ncourt, and  the adequacy of lesser sanctions.1   Mindful that\r\n\ncase management is  a fact-specific matter within  the ken of\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     1See Figueroa  Ruiz v. Alegria,  896 F.2d 645,  648 (1st\r                                               \r\nCir. 1990); 9  C. Wright  &amp; A.

Although Rules 16\r\n\nand  41 do  not  formally require  any particular  procedure,\r\n\ncounsel's  disregard  of  a  prior  warning  from  the  court\r\n\nexacerbates the  offense, and  the lack of  warning sometimes\r\n\nmitigates it.   Velazquez-Rivera v.  Sea-Land Service,  Inc.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n920  F.2d 1072,  1078  (1st  Cir.  1990).    Ordinarily,  the\r\n\nplaintiff is given an  opportunity to explain the  default or\r\n\nargue  for a lesser penalty; but again there is no mechanical\r\n\nrule.  Link,  370 U.S. at 632.  The presence or absence of an\r                       \r\n\nexplanation by  the district court may also be a factor.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nDamiani, 704 F.2d at 17.\r                   \r\n\n     In this  instance, our main  concern is that  despite an\r\n\napparent  pattern  of noncompliance  by  plaintiffs' counsel,\r\n\nfactual  disputes exist  over the  extent of  the misconduct,\r\n\nincluding excuses  offered as to  each of the  episodes, that\r\n\nhave  never been resolved by the district court.  Cf. Richman\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.  General Motors  Corp., 437  F.2d  196, 199-200  (1st Cir.\r                                     \r\n\n1971).  If we were  dealing in this case with a minor  act of\r\n\nnegligence  rather  than a  pattern,  dismissal  might appear\r\n\nharsh  where  no prior  warning was  given  and there  was no\r\n\nshowing  of special prejudice to the  opponents or the court.\r\n\nSee Velazquez-Rivera, 920 F.2d at 1077-78.\r                                \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\n     In considering  the likely  bases for the  dismissal, we\r\n\nput to one  side plaintiffs' failure to attend  the pre-trial\r\n\nhearing, since there is no indication that the district court\r\n\nconsidered  it  in deciding  to dismiss  the  case.   We also\r\n\nignore Phelan's 15-minutes late arrival  on the day of trial,\r\n\nbecause  by  the time  he arrived  for  trial, the  court had\r\n\nalready dismissed  the case  without considering  whether his\r\n\nlateness  was excused.   What remains is  to consider whether\r\n\nthe  missed pre-trial deadlines,  taken together,  provide an\r\n\nadequate basis for dismissal.   They might well do  so but in\r\n\neach instance Phelan  has offered some excuse that  has never\r\n\nbeen addressed.\r\n\n     1.   Late  filing of  stipulation of  uncontested facts.\r                                                                        \r\n\nThe parties  did not  start discussing the  stipulation until\r\n\nApril 3, when the  defendants' attorney, John Ottenberg, sent\r\n\nPhelan a draft of a proposed stipulation by fax.  On April 6,\r\n\nOttenberg advised that he  wished to add one witness  for the\r\n\ndefense.   On April  7, a Friday  and the  last business  day\r\n\nbefore the stipulation was due, Phelan sent back a draft with\r\n\nchanges.   The defendants  say that in  addition to modifying\r\n\nthe proposed  facts, Phelan made unauthorized  alterations to\r\n\nthe defendants' list of witnesses.\r                           \r\n\n     The defendants found some of these  changes unacceptable\r\n\nand sent  another draft to Phelan  on that same  day.  Phelan\r\n\ndid  not respond until after  the close of  business on April\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\n10,  when  he  sent a  further  draft,  which the  defendants\r\n\nrejected.  No joint  stipulation was filed, and on  April 11,\r\n\nPhelan contacted a court  clerk, who advised him to  file his\r\n\nown version of the stipulation.  Although defendants filed  a\r\n\nseparate  stipulation on April 12, Phelan did not do so until\r\n\nApril 20.\r\n\n     Phelan  says he  contracted a  sinus and  lung infection\r\n\nduring the time the parties were negotiating the stipulation.\r\n\nThis might account for his delay in filing his version of the\r\n\nstipulation,  but it does not  explain why he  waited so long\r\n\nbefore   starting  to   discuss  the  stipulation   with  the\r\n\ndefendants.  At best,  Phelan's conduct appears careless, but\r\n\nit  is difficult  to  tell  without  knowing why  Phelan  did\r\n\nnothing until Ottenberg seized the initiative.\r\n\n     2.  Late  filing of exhibit  list due April 17.   Phelan\r                                                               \r\n\nalso failed  to meet  the deadline of  April 17 for  filing a\r\n\nlist of  exhibits; he filed the list a week late on April 24.\r\n\nPhelan  claims  that his  illness  prevented  his filing  the\r\n\nexhibits on time,  and further  that a court  clerk told  him\r\n\n\"there  should be no  problem\" if he filed  the list within a\r\n\nweek after  the deadline.   Phelan's position is  weakened by\r\n\nhis  failure  to  file  a  motion,  but  there  is  certainly\r\n\nmitigation  if he did suffer  a serious illness  in this time\r\n\nframe, a matter the district court did not address.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\n     3.    Failure to  make  exhibits  available for  review.\r                                                                        \r\n\nOttenberg  says  he  requested  access  to   the  plaintiffs'\r\n\nexhibits on  April 3 and again  on April 17, but  that Phelan\r\n\ndid  not  respond.   Phelan,  in contrast,  asserts  that the\r\n\nexhibits were available for review on  April 14.  It is  hard\r\n\nto know which account is correct, and the district court made\r\n\nno finding on the point.2\r\n\n     On appeal,  Phelan argues  that the pre-trial  order did\r\n\nnot set a deadline for making exhibits available to the other\r\n\nside.   But on any reasonable reading, the order required the\r\n\nparties to  make exhibits available reasonably  in advance of\r\n\nApril 24, when objections to  the proposed exhibits were due.\r\n\nFar from  supporting Phelan,  this defense detracts  from his\r\n\nposition.\r\n\n     The need for remand is evident.  If Phelan was  at fault\r\n\nin  all three  episodes,  dismissal was  within the  district\r\n\ncourt's discretion; on the  other hand, Phelan offers excuses\r\n\nfor  all three  and  there are  no  findings to  resolve  the\r\n\nmatter.  We leave  it open to the district court to reinstate\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     2There is  some reason  to question Phelan's  claim that\r\nthe  exhibits were available as early as April 14.  According\r\nto  the defense,  on April  27, Ottenberg's  paralegal called\r\nPhelan and  offered to exchange  copies of exhibits.   Phelan\r\nsaid he would have his  exhibits copied by the next day.   On\r\nApril 28, the last business day before trial, Phelan informed\r\nOttenberg that  the copies were  not ready  but the  exhibits\r\nwere  available for review and Ottenberg could use the copier\r\nin Phelan's office.\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\nthe dismissal if it supportably finds  a pattern of unexcused\r\n\nnoncompliance with the court's order.\r\n\n     We reject  now the Robsons' alternative  arguments as to\r\n\nwhy such a pattern even if proved could not justify dismissal\r\n\nin  this case.   First,  the Robsons  argue that there  is no\r\n\nshowing of prejudice, such  as the loss of a witness  for the\r\n\ndefense.  In our  view, such a specific showing  of prejudice\r\n\nwould  aggravate  the misconduct,  but  is  not necessary  to\r\n\njustify dismissal.   Cf. Figueroa  Ruiz v. Alegria,  896 F.2d\r                                                              \r\n\n645,  649  (1st  Cir.  1990).   Repeated  disobedience  of  a\r\n\nscheduling   order   is   inherently   prejudicial,   because\r\n\ndisruption  of the  court's schedule  and the  preparation of\r\n\nother parties nearly always results.\r\n\n     Second, the Robsons argue that the sanction of dismissal\r\n\nis  too severe in these  circumstances.  There  might be some\r\n\nmerit to the  plaintiffs' argument  if we were  faced with  a\r\n\nsingle  instance of  careless  misconduct.   A succession  of\r\n\nviolations,  however, indicating  a general  unwillingness to\r\n\ncomply  with  a court-imposed  scheduling  order,  is for  us\r\n\nenough  to  justify  dismissal.   Calendars  are  simply  too\r\n\ncrowded for  parties to  treat scheduling orders  as optional\r\n\nand to conduct trial preparations at their own convenience.\r\n\n     Finally,  the Robsons  point to  the absence  of warning\r\n\nthat  the court  was considering  dismissal.   This may  be a\r\n\npertinent factor in evaluating a dismissal, especially if the\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\nconduct  in  question did  not  violate  a clear  preexisting\r\n\nrequirement.   In this case, however, the scheduling order is\r\n\nclear and by its  terms requires the parties to  meet certain\r\n\ndeadlines.   A court need not provide  warning that dismissal\r\n\nwill result from repeated violations of such an order.\r\n\n     The  defendants have  cross-appealed  from the  district\r\n\ncourt's denial on March  9, 1994 of their motion  to dismiss,\r\n\nfor judgment on the pleadings, and for summary judgment.  The\r\n\ndenial  of  the  defendants'  motion  is   not  independently\r\n\nappealable as a final  order.  See Pedraza v.  Shell Oil Co.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n942  F.2d 48, 54-55 (1st  Cir. 1991), cert.  denied, 502 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\n1082  (1992).   This  court has  said  it will  generally not\r\n\nreview denials of summary judgment or the like ancillary to a\r\n\ndifferent appealable order, although  it has stopped short of\r\n\nsaying  such review  is always  foreclosed.   Id.; see  10 C.\r                                                                  \r\n\nWright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure   2715, at 636-\r                                                         \r\n\n38 (2d ed. 1983).\r\n\n     Assuming this court could choose to review the denial of\r\n\ndefendants'  motions on  an ancillary  basis, we  are certain\r\n\nthat this  is  not the  case  for such  an exception  to  the\r\n\ngeneral rule  against such  review of an  otherwise non-final\r\n\norder.  The cross-appeal here attempts to present a factually\r\n\ncomplex summary judgment claim that is not closely related to\r\n\nour review  of the appealable  order dismissing the  case for\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\nmisconduct.   There  is  no simple,  abstract legal  question\r\n\nwhose resolution now might avoid a lengthy trial.\r\n\n     In  vacating the  order of  dismissal and  remanding for\r\n\nfurther  proceedings,  we are  not  suggesting that  explicit\r\n\nfindings with respect to a party's misconduct and excuses are\r\n\nnecessary  for every such dismissal.   In many cases findings\r\n\nmay  be easily inferred from  the record.   What is difficult\r\n\nhere is that there  are at least three different  episodes of\r\n\nmisconduct,  the plaintiffs' counsel  has proffered an excuse\r\n\nfor each, and the  district court has not expressed  any view\r\n\non the  matter  that would  permit  us to  provide  effective\r\n\nreview.\r\n\n     The judgment of  the district court  is vacated and  the\r                                                                \r\n\ncase is remanded for further proceedings.\r                            \r\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n",

Donald and Sandra Robson, brought suit against Gilman Hallenbeck and Dan DiCarlo, alleging that the defendants breached fiduciary duties owed to the Robsons, administered a trust in a grossly negligent manner, and committed fraud.   The details of this action need not be discussed, since the principal issue in the plaintiffs' appeal is procedural and we decline the defendants' invitation to reach the merits on their cross-appeal.   But because the case was ultimately dismissed on account of the plaintiffs' conduct in pre-trial proceedings, a description of the events leading up to the dismissal is required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a pre-trial conference on September 30, 1994, the district judge entered an order that required the parties to meet a series of deadlines in preparation for trial, which was set for May 1, 1995:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. By April 10, 1995, the parties were to file a stipulation of uncontested facts, together with a statement of issues to be tried and a list of witnesses for each side.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. By April 17, the parties were to submit lists of proposed exhibits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. By April 24, the parties were to file notices of any objections to proposed exhibits or expert witnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties were also directed to make exhibits available to the opposing party for inspection, to file a trial brief by the day of trial, and to file requests for rulings of law on the day of trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs' attorney, Michael Phelan, failed to attend the September 1994 pre-trial conference, but received notice of the order and its timetable.   Under circumstances described more fully below, the plaintiffs did not meet the April 10 deadline for filing the stipulation of uncontested facts.   The plaintiffs also failed to file a list of proposed exhibits by April 17.   The parties dispute whether the plaintiffs made their exhibits available for review by defense counsel reasonably in advance of April 24, the deadline for filing objections to proposed exhibits.   Finally, the plaintiffs filed their requests for rulings of law on May 9, eight days late.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 1, when the trial was scheduled to begin, attorney Phelan appeared in court 15 minutes late and discovered that the judge had already dismissed the case with prejudice for failure to comply with the court's pre-trial order.   The plaintiffs filed a motion to vacate the order of dismissal;  the district judge denied it without opinion on May 24, 1995.   On June 22, 1995, the judge denied without opinion the plaintiffs' motion to reconsider their motion to vacate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the Robsons argue that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing the case because their actions did not amount to \"extreme\" misconduct, see Enlace Mercantil Internacional v. Senior Industries, 848 F.2d 315, 317 (1st Cir.1988), that any violations of the pre-trial order were excusable and did not prejudice the court or the defendants, and that a lesser sanction would have been appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is hard to find an area of law in which the governing rules are, and probably have to be, so vague.   Admittedly, a district court has broad authority to enforce pre-trial discipline and to dismiss a case for failure to obey pre-trial orders.   Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(f), 41(b);  see Link v. Wabash Railroad Co., 370 U.S. 626, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962).   The difficulty is that the range of circumstances is so vast, and the problems so much matters of degree, as to defy mechanical rules.   What the cases, taken together, do is to set forth a list of pertinent considerations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among those commonly mentioned (this list is not complete) are the severity of the violation, the legitimacy of the party's excuse, repetition of violations, the deliberateness vel non of the misconduct, mitigating excuses, prejudice to the other side and to the operations of the court, and the adequacy of lesser sanctions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Mindful that case management is a fact-specific matter within the ken of the district court, reviewing courts have reversed only for a clear abuse of discretion.  Damiani v. Rhode Island Hosp., 704 F.2d 12, 17 (1st Cir.1983) (collecting cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is also a procedural dimension.   Although Rules 16 and 41 do not formally require any particular procedure, counsel's disregard of a prior warning from the court exacerbates the offense, and the lack of warning sometimes mitigates it.  Velazquez-Rivera v. Sea-Land Service, Inc., 920 F.2d 1072, 1078 (1st Cir.1990).   Ordinarily, the plaintiff is given an opportunity to explain the default or argue for a lesser penalty;  but again there is no mechanical rule.  Link, 370 U.S. at 632, 82 S.Ct. at 1389-1390.   The presence or absence of an explanation by the district court may also be a factor.   See Damiani, 704 F.2d at 17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, our main concern is that despite an apparent pattern of noncompliance by plaintiffs' counsel, factual disputes exist over the extent of the misconduct, including excuses offered as to each of the episodes, that have never been resolved by the district court.   Cf. Richman v. General Motors Corp., 437 F.2d 196, 199-200 (1st Cir.1971).   If we were dealing in this case with a minor act of negligence rather than a pattern, dismissal might appear harsh where no prior warning was given and there was no showing of special prejudice to the opponents or the court.   See Velazquez-Rivera, 920 F.2d at 1077-78.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In considering the likely bases for the dismissal, we put to one side plaintiffs' failure to attend the pre-trial hearing, since there is no indication that the district court considered it in deciding to dismiss the case.   We also ignore Phelan's 15-minutes late arrival on the day of trial, because by the time he arrived for trial, the court had already dismissed the case without considering whether his lateness was excused.   What remains is to consider whether the missed pre-trial deadlines, taken together, provide an adequate basis for dismissal.   They might well do so but in each instance Phelan has offered some excuse that has never been addressed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Late filing of stipulation of uncontested facts.   The parties did not start discussing the stipulation until April 3, when the defendants' attorney, John Ottenberg, sent Phelan a draft of a proposed stipulation by fax.   On April 6, Ottenberg advised that he wished to add one witness for the defense.   On April 7, a Friday and the last business day before the stipulation was due, Phelan sent back a draft with changes.   The defendants say that in addition to modifying the proposed facts, Phelan made unauthorized alterations to the defendants' list of witnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants found some of these changes unacceptable and sent another draft to Phelan on that same day.   Phelan did not respond until after the close of business on April 10, when he sent a further draft, which the defendants rejected.   No joint stipulation was filed, and on April 11, Phelan contacted a court clerk, who advised him to file his own version of the stipulation.   Although defendants filed a separate stipulation on April 12, Phelan did not do so until April 20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phelan says he contracted a sinus and lung infection during the time the parties were negotiating the stipulation.   This might account for his delay in filing his version of the stipulation, but it does not explain why he waited so long before starting to discuss the stipulation with the defendants.   At best, Phelan's conduct appears careless, but it is difficult to tell without knowing why Phelan did nothing until Ottenberg seized the initiative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Late filing of exhibit list due April 17.   Phelan also failed to meet the deadline of April 17 for filing a list of exhibits;  he filed the list a week late on April 24.   Phelan claims that his illness prevented his filing the exhibits on time, and further that a court clerk told him \"there should be no problem\" if he filed the list within a week after the deadline.   Phelan's position is weakened by his failure to file a motion, but there is certainly mitigation if he did suffer a serious illness in this time frame, a matter the district court did not address.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Failure to make exhibits available for review.   Ottenberg says he requested access to the plaintiffs' exhibits on April 3 and again on April 17, but that Phelan did not respond.   Phelan, in contrast, asserts that the exhibits were available for review on April 14.   It is hard to know which account is correct, and the district court made no finding on the point.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Phelan argues that the pre-trial order did not set a deadline for making exhibits available to the other side.   But on any reasonable reading, the order required the parties to make exhibits available reasonably in advance of April 24, when objections to the proposed exhibits were due.   Far from supporting Phelan, this defense detracts from his position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The need for remand is evident.   If Phelan was at fault in all three episodes, dismissal was within the district court's discretion;  on the other hand, Phelan offers excuses for all three and there are no findings to resolve the matter.   We leave it open to the district court to reinstate the dismissal if it supportably finds a pattern of unexcused noncompliance with the court's order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject now the Robsons' alternative arguments as to why such a pattern even if proved could not justify dismissal in this case.   First, the Robsons argue that there is no showing of prejudice, such as the loss of a witness for the defense.   In our view, such a specific showing of prejudice would aggravate the misconduct, but is not necessary to justify dismissal.   Cf. Figueroa Ruiz v. Alegria, 896 F.2d 645, 649 (1st Cir.1990).   Repeated disobedience of a scheduling order is inherently prejudicial, because disruption of the court's schedule and the preparation of other parties nearly always results.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the Robsons argue that the sanction of dismissal is too severe in these circumstances.   There might be some merit to the plaintiffs' argument if we were faced with a single instance of careless misconduct.   A succession of violations, however, indicating a general unwillingness to comply with a court-imposed scheduling order, is for us enough to justify dismissal.   Calendars are simply too crowded for parties to treat scheduling orders as optional and to conduct trial preparations at their own convenience.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Robsons point to the absence of warning that the court was considering dismissal.   This may be a pertinent factor in evaluating a dismissal, especially if the conduct in question did not violate a clear preexisting requirement.   In this case, however, the scheduling order is clear and by its terms requires the parties to meet certain deadlines.   A court need not provide warning that dismissal will result from repeated violations of such an order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants have cross-appealed from the district court's denial on March 9, 1994 of their motion to dismiss, for judgment on the pleadings, and for summary judgment.   The denial of the defendants' motion is not independently appealable as a final order.   See Pedraza v. Shell Oil Co., 942 F.2d 48, 54-55 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1082, 112 S.Ct. 993, 117 L.Ed.2d 154 (1992).   This court has said it will generally not review denials of summary judgment or the like ancillary to a different appealable order, although it has stopped short of saying such review is always foreclosed.  Id.;  see 10 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 2715, at 636-38 (2d ed. 1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming this court could choose to review the denial of defendants' motions on an ancillary basis, we are certain that this is not the case for such an exception to the general rule against such review of an otherwise non-final order.   The cross-appeal here attempts to present a factually complex summary judgment claim that is not closely related to our review of the appealable order dismissing the case for misconduct.   There is no simple, abstract legal question whose resolution now might avoid a lengthy trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In vacating the order of dismissal and remanding for further proceedings, we are not suggesting that explicit findings with respect to a party's misconduct and excuses are necessary for every such dismissal.   In many cases findings may be easily inferred from the record.   What is difficult here is that there are at least three different episodes of misconduct, the plaintiffs' counsel has proffered an excuse for each, and the district court has not expressed any view on the matter that would permit us to provide effective review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> See Figueroa Ruiz v.

According to the defense, on April 27, Ottenberg's paralegal called Phelan and offered to exchange copies of exhibits.   Phelan said he would have his exhibits copied by the next day.   On April 28, the last business day before trial, Phelan informed Ottenberg that the copies were not ready but the exhibits were available for review and Ottenberg could use the copier in Phelan's office</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Ottenberg with whom Berry, Ottenberg, Dunkless &amp; Parker, Boston, MA, was on consolidated brief for defendants.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before SELYA, BOUDIN and LYNCH, Circuit Judges.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs, J. Donald and Sandra Robson, brought suit against Gilman Hallenbeck and Dan DiCarlo, alleging that the defendants breached fiduciary duties owed to the Robsons, administered a trust in a grossly negligent manner, and committed fraud.   The details of this action need not be discussed, since the principal issue in the plaintiffs' appeal is procedural and we decline the defendants' invitation to reach the merits on their cross-appeal.   But because the case was ultimately dismissed on account of the plaintiffs' conduct in pre-trial proceedings, a description of the events leading up to the dismissal is required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a pre-trial conference on September 30, 1994, the district judge entered an order that required the parties to meet a series of deadlines in preparation for trial, which was set for May 1, 1995:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. By April 10, 1995, the parties were to file a stipulation of uncontested facts, together with a statement of issues to be tried and a list of witnesses for each side.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. By April 17, the parties were to submit lists of proposed exhibits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. By April 24, the parties were to file notices of any objections to proposed exhibits or expert witnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties were also directed to make exhibits available to the opposing party for inspection, to file a trial brief by the day of trial, and to file requests for rulings of law on the day of trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs' attorney, Michael Phelan, failed to attend the September 1994 pre-trial conference, but received notice of the order and its timetable.   Under circumstances described more fully below, the plaintiffs did not meet the April 10 deadline for filing the stipulation of uncontested facts.   The plaintiffs also failed to file a list of proposed exhibits by April 17.   The parties dispute whether the plaintiffs made their exhibits available for review by defense counsel reasonably in advance of April 24, the deadline for filing objections to proposed exhibits.   Finally, the plaintiffs filed their requests for rulings of law on May 9, eight days late.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 1, when the trial was scheduled to begin, attorney Phelan appeared in court 15 minutes late and discovered that the judge had already dismissed the case with prejudice for failure to comply with the court's pre-trial order.   The plaintiffs filed a motion to vacate the order of dismissal;  the district judge denied it without opinion on May 24, 1995.   On June 22, 1995, the judge denied without opinion the plaintiffs' motion to reconsider their motion to vacate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the Robsons argue that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing the case because their actions did not amount to \"extreme\" misconduct, see Enlace Mercantil Internacional v. Senior Industries, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"507080\"><a href=\"/opinion/507080/enlace-mercantil-internacional-inc-v-senior-industries-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">848</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span></a></span>, 317 (1st Cir.1988), that any violations of the pre-trial order were excusable and did not prejudice the court or the defendants, and that a lesser sanction would have been appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is hard to find an area of law in which the governing rules are, and probably have to be, so vague.   Admittedly, a district court has broad authority to enforce pre-trial discipline and to dismiss a case for failure to obey pre-trial orders.   Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(f), 41(b);  see Link v. Wabash Railroad Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106449\"><a href=\"/opinion/106449/link-v-wabash-r-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">626</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106449\"><a href=\"/opinion/106449/link-v-wabash-r-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1386</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106449\"><a href=\"/opinion/106449/link-v-wabash-r-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">734</span></a></span> (1962).   The difficulty is that the range of circumstances is so vast, and the problems so much matters of degree, as to defy mechanical rules.   What the cases, taken together, do is to set forth a list of pertinent considerations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among those commonly mentioned (this list is not complete) are the severity of the violation, the legitimacy of the party's excuse, repetition of violations, the deliberateness vel non of the misconduct, mitigating excuses, prejudice to the other side and to the operations of the court, and the adequacy of lesser sanctions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Mindful that case management is a fact-specific matter within the ken of the district court, reviewing courts have reversed only for a clear abuse of discretion.  Damiani v. Rhode Island Hosp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"416550\"><a href=\"/opinion/416550/louis-m-damiani-md-v-rhode-island-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">704</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1983) (collecting cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is also a procedural dimension.   Although Rules 16 and 41 do not formally require any particular procedure, counsel's disregard of a prior warning from the court exacerbates the offense, and the lack of warning sometimes mitigates it.  Velazquez-Rivera v. Sea-Land Service, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552773\"><a href=\"/opinion/552773/luis-felipe-velazquez-rivera-v-sea-land-service-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1072</span></a></span>, 1078 (1st Cir.1990).   Ordinarily, the plaintiff is given an opportunity to explain the default or argue for a lesser penalty;  but again there is no mechanical rule.  Link, 370 U.S. at 632, 82 S.Ct. at 1389-1390.   The presence or absence of an explanation by the district court may also be a factor.   See Damiani, 704 F.2d at 17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, our main concern is that despite an apparent pattern of noncompliance by plaintiffs' counsel, factual disputes exist over the extent of the misconduct, including excuses offered as to each of the episodes, that have never been resolved by the district court.   Cf. Richman v. General Motors Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"294433\"><a href=\"/opinion/294433/nathan-richman-administrator-v-general-motors-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">196</span></a></span>, 199-200 (1st Cir.1971).   If we were dealing in this case with a minor act of negligence rather than a pattern, dismissal might appear harsh where no prior warning was given and there was no showing of special prejudice to the opponents or the court.   See Velazquez-Rivera, 920 F.2d at 1077-78.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In considering the likely bases for the dismissal, we put to one side plaintiffs' failure to attend the pre-trial hearing, since there is no indication that the district court considered it in deciding to dismiss the case.   We also ignore Phelan's 15-minutes late arrival on the day of trial, because by the time he arrived for trial, the court had already dismissed the case without considering whether his lateness was excused.   What remains is to consider whether the missed pre-trial deadlines, taken together, provide an adequate basis for dismissal.   They might well do so but in each instance Phelan has offered some excuse that has never been addressed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Late filing of stipulation of uncontested facts.   The parties did not start discussing the stipulation until April 3, when the defendants' attorney, John Ottenberg, sent Phelan a draft of a proposed stipulation by fax.   On April 6, Ottenberg advised that he wished to add one witness for the defense.   On April 7, a Friday and the last business day before the stipulation was due, Phelan sent back a draft with changes.   The defendants say that in addition to modifying the proposed facts, Phelan made unauthorized alterations to the defendants' list of witnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants found some of these changes unacceptable and sent another draft to Phelan on that same day.   Phelan did not respond until after the close of business on April 10, when he sent a further draft, which the defendants rejected.   No joint stipulation was filed, and on April 11, Phelan contacted a court clerk, who advised him to file his own version of the stipulation.   Although defendants filed a separate stipulation on April 12, Phelan did not do so until April 20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Phelan says he contracted a sinus and lung infection during the time the parties were negotiating the stipulation.   This might account for his delay in filing his version of the stipulation, but it does not explain why he waited so long before starting to discuss the stipulation with the defendants.   At best, Phelan's conduct appears careless, but it is difficult to tell without knowing why Phelan did nothing until Ottenberg seized the initiative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Late filing of exhibit list due April 17.   Phelan also failed to meet the deadline of April 17 for filing a list of exhibits;  he filed the list a week late on April 24.   Phelan claims that his illness prevented his filing the exhibits on time, and further that a court clerk told him \"there should be no problem\" if he filed the list within a week after the deadline.   Phelan's position is weakened by his failure to file a motion, but there is certainly mitigation if he did suffer a serious illness in this time frame, a matter the district court did not address.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Failure to make exhibits available for review.   Ottenberg says he requested access to the plaintiffs' exhibits on April 3 and again on April 17, but that Phelan did not respond.   Phelan, in contrast, asserts that the exhibits were available for review on April 14.   It is hard to know which account is correct, and the district court made no finding on the point.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Phelan argues that the pre-trial order did not set a deadline for making exhibits available to the other side.   But on any reasonable reading, the order required the parties to make exhibits available reasonably in advance of April 24, when objections to the proposed exhibits were due.   Far from supporting Phelan, this defense detracts from his position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The need for remand is evident.   If Phelan was at fault in all three episodes, dismissal was within the district court's discretion;  on the other hand, Phelan offers excuses for all three and there are no findings to resolve the matter.   We leave it open to the district court to reinstate the dismissal if it supportably finds a pattern of unexcused noncompliance with the court's order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject now the Robsons' alternative arguments as to why such a pattern even if proved could not justify dismissal in this case.   First, the Robsons argue that there is no showing of prejudice, such as the loss of a witness for the defense.   In our view, such a specific showing of prejudice would aggravate the misconduct, but is not necessary to justify dismissal.   Cf. Figueroa Ruiz v. Alegria, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536977\"><a href=\"/opinion/536977/rafael-figueroa-ruiz-v-jose-e-alegria/\"><span class=\"volume\">896</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">645</span></a></span>, 649 (1st Cir.1990).   Repeated disobedience of a scheduling order is inherently prejudicial, because disruption of the court's schedule and the preparation of other parties nearly always results.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the Robsons argue that the sanction of dismissal is too severe in these circumstances.   There might be some merit to the plaintiffs' argument if we were faced with a single instance of careless misconduct.   A succession of violations, however, indicating a general unwillingness to comply with a court-imposed scheduling order, is for us enough to justify dismissal.   Calendars are simply too crowded for parties to treat scheduling orders as optional and to conduct trial preparations at their own convenience.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Robsons point to the absence of warning that the court was considering dismissal.   This may be a pertinent factor in evaluating a dismissal, especially if the conduct in question did not violate a clear preexisting requirement.   In this case, however, the scheduling order is clear and by its terms requires the parties to meet certain deadlines.   A court need not provide warning that dismissal will result from repeated violations of such an order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants have cross-appealed from the district court's denial on March 9, 1994 of their motion to dismiss, for judgment on the pleadings, and for summary judgment.   The denial of the defendants' motion is not independently appealable as a final order.   See Pedraza v. Shell Oil Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566798\"><a href=\"/opinion/566798/cruz-pedraza-alejandrina-pedraza-roberto-pedraza-and-mary-ellen-pedraza/\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span>, 54-55 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1082</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">993</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></span> (1992).   This court has said it will generally not review denials of summary judgment or the like ancillary to a different appealable order, although it has stopped short of saying such review is always foreclosed.  Id.;  see 10 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 2715, at 636-38 (2d ed. 1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming this court could choose to review the denial of defendants' motions on an ancillary basis, we are certain that this is not the case for such an exception to the general rule against such review of an otherwise non-final order.   The cross-appeal here attempts to present a factually complex summary judgment claim that is not closely related to our review of the appealable order dismissing the case for misconduct.   There is no simple, abstract legal question whose resolution now might avoid a lengthy trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In vacating the order of dismissal and remanding for further proceedings, we are not suggesting that explicit findings with respect to a party's misconduct and excuses are necessary for every such dismissal.   In many cases findings may be easily inferred from the record.   What is difficult here is that there are at least three different episodes of misconduct, the plaintiffs' counsel has proffered an excuse for each, and the district court has not expressed any view on the matter that would permit us to provide effective review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> See Figueroa Ruiz v. Alegria, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536977\"><a href=\"/opinion/536977/rafael-figueroa-ruiz-v-jose-e-alegria/\"><span class=\"volume\">896</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">645</span></a></span>, 648 (1st Cir.1990);  9 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 2370 (2d ed. 1995)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> There is some reason to question Phelan's claim that the exhibits were available as early as April 14.   According to the defense, on April 27, Ottenberg's paralegal called Phelan and offered to exchange copies of exhibits.   Phelan said he would have his exhibits copied by the next day.   On April 28, the last business day before trial, Phelan informed Ottenberg that the copies were not ready but the exhibits were available for review and Ottenberg could use the copier in Phelan's office</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
