Michael A. Ponsor, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                   and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n\n     Harold Omar Mack on brief pro se.\n     Claudia A. Hunter, Kelly Kalandyk Smith and Hunter & Bobit,\nP.C. on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         March 28, 2002\n\f            Per Curiam.    Plaintiff/appellant Harold Mack filed\n\n  this pro se action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, complaining inter\n\n  alia that he had been improperly treated with antipsychotic\n\n  drugs while being detained prior to trial.    Eleven individuals\n\n  were named as defendants.     In a June 14, 2001 order, the\n\n  district court granted a motion to dismiss filed by one of the\n\n  defendants (David Hammond, M.D.) and certified the matter for\n\n  immediate appeal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b).     We dismiss the\n\n  appeal on the ground that the Rule 54(b) certification was\n\n  improvidently granted.\n\n            Plaintiff's vague complaint has been construed as\n\n  advancing three claims against defendant Hammond: (1) a federal\n\n  constitutional claim;1 (2) a claim for intentional infliction\n\n  of emotional distress; and (3) a claim for medical malpractice.\n\n  The third-listed claim was referred to a malpractice tribunal,\n\n  see, e.g., Feinstein v. Massachusetts General Hosp., 643 F.2d\n\n  880 (1st Cir. 1981), which ruled in Hammond's favor.        When\n\n  plaintiff failed to post the required bond, Hammond moved to\n\n  dismiss the malpractice claim.      The district court, adopting\n\n  the recommendation of a magistrate-judge, granted that motion\n\n  and issued its Rule 54(b) certification.\n\n\n     1\n        The constitutional claim has been treated below as arising\nunder the Eighth Amendment.    Yet given plaintiff's status as a\npretrial detainee, it should probably instead be viewed as resting\non the Due Process Clause. See, e.g., Elliott v. Cheshire County,\nNew Hampshire, 940 F.2d 7, 10 & n.2 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n                                -2-\n\f                In support of the court's certification, Hammond now\n\n  asserts that its order not only disposed of the malpractice\n\n  claim but \"sua sponte\" dismissed the other two claims as well.\n\n  We disagree.       The magistrate-judge stated that \"any Eighth\n\n  Amendment claims ... should survive\" the motion to dismiss.\n\n  Dkt. # 66, at 2 n.1.          The district court made no mention of\n\n  \"modif[ying]\" this aspect of the report, as Hammond argues;\n\n  instead, it simply \"adopted\" the report \"[f]or the reasons\n\n  stated\" therein.       Dkt. # 69, at 1.      Moreover, in later granting\n\n  similar motions filed by six other defendants, the court\n\n  explicitly stated that \"the Eighth Amendment claims remain.\"\n\n  Dkt. # 81 (margin order).           There is no basis for suspecting\n\n  that    the    court   intended     to     treat    Hammond's      motion   any\n\n  differently than the others.\n\n                Accordingly,    we    think    it    clear    that   plaintiff's\n\n  constitutional claim against Hammond remains unadjudicated.2\n\n  This circumstance alone renders the certification \"particularly\n\n  suspect,\" Kersey v. Dennison Mfg. Co., 3 F.3d 482, 487 (1st Cir.\n\n  1993), since resort to Rule 54(b) will rarely be appropriate\n\n  \"when   the     contestants    on    appeal       remain,    simultaneously,\n\n  contestants below,\" Spiegel v. Trustees of Tufts College, 843\n\n\n     2\n        We need not decide whether the emotional-distress claim\nlikewise remains pending, or whether it instead was effectively\nincorporated within the matters referred to the tribunal. Cf. Kapp\nv. Balantine, 380 Mass. 186, 190, 196 (1980) (suggesting that such\na claim can properly be submitted to tribunal).\n\n                                       -3-\n\fF.2d 38, 44 (1st Cir. 1988).         Further, the \"substantial ...\n\nprospect of contextual overlap\" here between the certified and\n\npending   claims,   Kersey,    3   F.3d   at   487,   counsels   against\n\ninterlocutory review.\n\n           The district court did not explain its reasons for\n\nthe certification but almost certainly had in mind Hammond's\n\nassertion that the pending of the malpractice claim must be\n\nreported to his insurer and the State Board of Registration of\n\nMedicine until a final judgment is entered.                We are not\n\nunsympathetic to this concern, but no financial consequences of\n\nreporting are alleged and, at least where related unadjusted\n\nclaims are pending against the same defendant, it is unclear\n\nhow interlocutory review of one claim would remove whatever\n\ncloud may exist.\n\n           The appeal is dismissed without prejudice for want of\n\nappellate jurisdiction.       The case is remanded to the district\n\ncourt for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. No\n\ncosts.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\f",
