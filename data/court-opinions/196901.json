This products liability action\r                    TORRUELLA, Chief Judge.\r                                          \r\n\narose out  of the sinking of  the lobster vessel, the  SEA FEVER.\r\n\nThe vessel's owner and operator, Rodney Sullivan (\"Sullivan\"), by\r\n\nhis insurer, brought this suit  to recover for damages  sustained\r\n\ndue to  the SEA FEVER's  sinking.  Sullivan brought  suit against\r\n\nVernay Products, Inc.  (\"Vernay\") and Young Brothers  and Company\r\n\nInc. (\"Young  Brothers\")  under  theories  of  strict  liability,\r\n\nnegligence, and breach of implied  and express warranties.  Young\r\n\nBrothers  crossclaimed  against  Vernay  for indemnification  and\r\n\ncontribution,  and Vernay  similarly  crossclaimed against  Young\r\n\nBrothers  for  indemnification and  contribution.    The district\r\n\ncourt found  only Vernay to be  liable for the  damages caused by\r\n\nthe SEA  FEVER's sinking and  awarded damages to Sullivan  in the\r\n\namount of $54,318.68.  On  the crossclaim, it entered judgment in\r\n\nfavor of  Young Brothers.   Before us  is Vernay's appeal  of the\r\n\ndistrict court's judgment, damage award, and denial of its motion\r\n\nfor summary judgment and motions for judgment as a matter of law.\r\n\nAlso before us is Sullivan's cross-appeal of the district court's\r\n\nfinding  that Young  Brothers was  not liable.   For  the reasons\r\n\nstated  below, we  affirm, in  part,  and reverse,  in part,  the\r\n\njudgment below.\r\n\n                          I.  BACKGROUND\r                                    I.  BACKGROUND\r                                                  \r\n\n          We  take the  facts,  particularly  the more  technical\r\n\naspects,  almost  verbatim  from the  district  court's  detailed\r\n\nopinion. \r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n          The  SEA FEVER is a forty-foot, fiberglass hull lobster\r\n\nboat built  by Young Brothers  in 1989, which  Sullivan purchased\r\n\nnew from Young Brothers in  February 1990 for $122,000.  Sullivan\r\n\nadded  various  items  of  gear  and furnishings  at  a  cost  of\r\n\napproximately $10,000.  Young Brothers built the SEA FEVER with a\r\n\nwet  exhaust  system, which  was composed,  in part,  of six-inch\r\n\ndiameter   Vernatube  fiberglass   marine   wet  exhaust   tubing\r\n\nmanufactured by  Vernay Products  (the \"Vernatube\"),  which is  a\r\n\nmanufacturer  of  various  fiberglass components  of  marine  wet\r\n\nexhaust systems. H  &amp; H Propeller Shop (\"H &amp; H Propeller\" or \"H &amp;\r\n\nH\"),1 Vernay's distributor in Maine, was the parts  supplier from\r\n\nwhich Young Brothers purchased the Vernatube installed aboard the\r\n\nSEA FEVER. \r\n\n          The SEA FEVER's wet exhaust system was constructed with\r\n\na fifteen-foot length of Vernatube.  Because Vernatube is sold in\r\n\nten-foot lengths, Young Brothers fiberglassed together a ten-foot\r\n\nand a five-foot length of  Vernatube, making, in effect, a single\r\n\nlength of  tube.   This span  of Vernatube  was connected to  the\r\n\nengine  at the  exhaust manifold  by a  flexible rubber  hose and\r\n\nrigidly installed in  the hull of the vessel  by fiberglass where\r\n\nthe   Vernatube  passed  through  the  fish  hold  bulkhead,  the\r\n\nlazarette bulkhead, and the transom.  Aft of the manifold, it was\r\n\nalso fiberglassed  to each of  the two bulkheads and  the transom\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  Sullivan's  complaint included claims against H  &amp; H Propeller\r\nunder  theories of  strict liability  and  breach of  express and\r\nimplied warranties.  Before trial began, those claims, along with\r\ncrossclaims and third-party  claims brought by and against  H &amp; H\r\nPropeller, were dismissed by stipulation of the parties.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nand  the Vernatube  exhaust was  supported by  a 3/4-inch  marine\r\n\nplywood bracket  lined with urethane  rubber at about  the midway\r\n\npoint of the  fish hold.  The  district court found that  the SEA\r\n\nFEVER's  Vernatube wet exhaust system was installed in conformity\r\n\nwith generally accepted methods of installation among builders of\r\n\nsimilar vessels in Maine.  The SEA FEVER was also equipped with a\r\n\nRule  1500 gallon  automatic bilge  pump.   This pump,  which was\r\n\ncapable  of discharging  up to  1500 gallons  of water  per hour,\r\n\ncould be operated manually or automatically.  \r\n\n          Sullivan operated the SEA FEVER as a commercial lobster\r\n\nvessel  during  the  1990  fishing   season  without  significant\r\n\nproblems.  In early 1991,  Sullivan discovered a crack (the \"1991\r\n\ncrack\") in  the portion of  the Vernatube exhaust located  in the\r\n\nlazarette, which permitted water to enter the vessel to the point\r\n\nof near sinking.  Sullivan discovered the crack because the bilge\r\n\npump was running more than usual.  At the time, the boat was tied\r\n\nto the dock and fully loaded with 90-100 lobster traps, such that\r\n\nthe  wet  exhaust  tubing  was   completely  submerged.  Sullivan\r\n\nnotified  Young  Brothers  of  this  crack,  and  Young  Brothers\r\n\nrepaired it by fiberglassing over the break.  Young Brothers also\r\n\nnotified  H  &amp; H  Propeller  of  the  crack.   Neither  of  these\r\n\ncompanies  notified  Vernay  of  this  crack,  and there  was  no\r\n\nevidence that  Sullivan did.  The cause of  this crack  was never\r\n\ninvestigated or discovered.  \r\n\n          After  this  repair,  the  SEA FEVER  operated  without\r\n\nfurther  problems and  Sullivan  fished  the  1991  season  until\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nJanuary 1992.   Thereafter,  the SEA FEVER  remained at  her slip\r\n\nuntil March  1992, when it  was hauled  for routine  maintenance.\r\n\nWhile  the  SEA FEVER  was  out of  the  water, Sullivan  did not\r\n\nspecifically inspect the exhaust system.   The record shows  that\r\n\nthe last time  he inspected it was  at the end  of the summer  of\r\n\n1991.  On March 17,  1992, Edward S. Blackmore, a marine surveyor\r\n\nappointed by Sullivan's  marine hull insurance  company, surveyed\r\n\nthe SEA  FEVER.   Blackmore  found  the  vessel to  be  in  \"A-1\"\r\n\ncondition with  a fair  market  value of  $130,000.   Blackmore's\r\n\ninspection included  observation of the Vernatube  exhaust, which\r\n\ndid not have any water in it at the time of the inspection as the\r\n\nSEA FEVER  was not loaded.   Nothing unusual was  noted about the\r\n\ncondition of the  Vernatube and Blackmore observed  no fractures,\r\n\nno discoloration, and no staining or other evidence of failure in\r\n\nthe Vernatube.  \r\n\n          After  the March  maintenance and  inspection, the  SEA\r\n\nFEVER was not operated  and remained at  her slip until April  4,\r\n\n1992.    On   that  day,  Sullivan  and  his   sternman  made  an\r\n\neight-to-ten-mile   trip  aboard  the   SEA  FEVER,   picking  up\r\n\napproximately eighty lobster  traps.  After returning,  they tied\r\n\nthe SEA FEVER to the  dock at about 1:00  p.m. and went home  for\r\n\nthe day.  Due to the weight of the lobster traps, the  end of the\r\n\nexhaust discharge port  was several inches under water  and, as a\r\n\nresult, the Vernatube  had water in it.   The SEA FEVER  was left\r\n\nwith the automatic bilge pump switch in the \"off\" position rather\r\n\nthan the \"automatic\" one.   Later that day, at approximately 7:30\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\np.m., Sullivan  was notified that the  SEA FEVER had  sunk at the\r\n\ndock.  Sullivan retained Wayne Godfrey,  a salvage diver from D &amp;\r\n\nG  Diving Services, to raise  the vessel, which was approximately\r\n\n90% to  95% submerged.   The  SEA FEVER  was  surveyed by  Werner\r\n\nSplettstoesser   of  Marine  Safety   Consultants  on  behalf  of\r\n\nSullivan's insurer, who determined that the SEA FEVER sank due to\r                            , \r\n\na crack  in the  wet exhaust  tubing which  was visible from  the\r\n\naccess hatch to the fish hold compartment.  This suit followed.\r\n\n          On  July 26,  1995, after a  four-day bench  trial, the\r\n\ndistrict court issued its written decision and order, in which it\r\n\nfound  that the  cause  of the  SEA  FEVER's sinking  was a  full\r\n\ncircumference crack in the Vernatube located a few inches forward\r\n\nof the  bulkhead between the  lazarette and fish hold  (the \"1992\r\n\ncrack\").  The district court further found that this crack  was a\r\n\nfatigue  failure caused by  tension stresses over  time exceeding\r\n\nthe  axial length  of the  tube.   As  there was  no  other known\r\n\ninstance prior  to the lawsuit  in which a Vernatube  had cracked\r\n\nunder  similar circumstances,  much of  the  trial testimony  was\r\n\ndirected  at the  question of  whether  the 1992  crack had  been\r\n\ncaused  by  a  defective  section  of  Vernatube  or by  improper\r\n\ninstallation of the exhaust system by Young Brothers.  \r\n\n          After  evaluation of  expert testimony  offered  by all\r\n\nthree  parties, review  of the  largely  technical evidence,  and\r\n\ninspection  and  analysis  of  the  SEA  FEVER's  Vernatube,  the\r\n\ndistrict  court found that the ten-foot section of the Vernatube,\r\n\nwhich developed at least two cracks during a two-year period, was\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\ndefective.   The  district  court  specifically  found  that  the\r\n\nevidence regarding the Vernatube's  porosity, wall thickness, and\r\n\nlongitudinal  strength  \"clearly  proves   that  the  section  of\r\n\nVernatube was defective\" and that  its defect contributed to  the\r\n\nVernatube's  failure in  the  SEA  FEVER.    In  particular,  the\r\n\ndistrict   court  found  that  with  respect  to  these  physical\r\n\nmeasures, the  Vernatube did  not live up  to the  specifications\r\n\ndescribed  in the Vernay Products Information Sheet (the \"VPIS\").\r\n\nIn making  its finding, the district court  noted that inspection\r\n\nof the Vernatube revealed several cracks, delamination, and areas\r\n\nof prospective  failure, all located  in the ten-foot  section as\r\n\nwell as one area of  debonding (i.e., where strands of  fiber had\r\n\ncome loose).    The district  court  explicitly ruled  out  other\r\n\nclaimed  reasons for the  Vernatube's failure, noting  that there\r\n\nwas no  evidence of owner  misuse and no indication  of Vernatube\r\n\nfailures in boats  similarly constructed.  Noting that  the trial\r\n\ntestimony  \"clearly established that hundreds of boats of similar\r\n\ndesign have  been constructed  with  this type  of rigid  exhaust\r\n\nsystem without one known failure,\"  the district court found that\r\n\nthe rigid  installation of SEA  FEVER's exhaust system was  not a\r\n\ncause  of  the  Vernatube's failure  and  that,  therefore, Young\r\n\nBrothers was not strictly liable  for its installation of the wet\r\n\nexhaust system.  In making this finding, the district court noted\r\n\nthat \"the existence of multiple failures and imperfections within\r\n\nthe  single  ten-foot section  of Vernatube,  notwithstanding the\r\n\nproduct's   known   track   record   of   problem-free    similar\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\ninstallations  in  hundreds  of   other  vessels,  supports   the\r\n\nconclusion that the SEA FEVER sank because this particular length\r\n\nof tube, rather than its installation, was defective.\"\r\n\n          In  addition, the district court held that (i) Vernay's\r\n\nwarning  against rigid installation,  while insufficient, did not\r\n\ngive rise to recovery --  but Vernay was nonetheless liable under\r\n\ntheories of negligence  and strict liability based on  defects in\r\n\ntubing; (ii) Sullivan was partially responsible for damage due to\r\n\nhis failure to leave his  boat's bilge pump in automatic position\r\n\ndespite knowing  of another crack  in the Vernatube  exhaust that\r\n\nneeded repair; (iii) Vernay was also liable for breach of express\r\n\nand  implied warranties; (iv) Sullivan's notice to Young Brothers\r\n\nwas  sufficient  to  allow  recovery for  breach  of  warranty by\r\n\nVernay; and  (v) Sullivan's recovery  would be reduced by  40% to\r\n\nreflect his comparative fault.\r\n\n          The  district  court  entered an  amended  judgment  on\r\n\nJuly 28,  1995, based  on its  earlier decision  and order.   The\r\n\ndistrict court had subject matter jurisdiction based on diversity\r\n\nof citizenship  and  satisfaction of  the jurisdictional  amount.\r\n\nSee 28  U.S.C.   1332(a).   We have  jurisdiction pursuant to  29\r             \r\n\nU.S.C.   1291 (appeals from a district court's final judgment).  \r\n\n                         II.

The  basic outline  of the  flurry of\r\n\nclaims  is as  follows.   Vernay  contests  the district  court's\r\n\nruling that  it  was  liable  under theories  of  warranty,  both\r\n\nexpress  and implied,  as well  as strict  liability  for product\r\n\ndefects  and negligence.   Furthermore,  Vernay  argues that  the\r\n\ndistrict  court  erred  in  rejecting  the  argument  that  Young\r\n\nBrothers' negligence constitutes a defense to Vernay's liability.\r\n\nAdditionally,  Vernay argues  that the  district  court erred  in\r\n\nfailing  to  conclude  that Sullivan's  own  conduct  should have\r\n\noperated to bar  Vernay's liability, rather  than occasion a  40%\r\n\nreduction.  Finally, Vernay argues  that the district court erred\r\n\nin finding  Young Brothers to  be without liability under  any of\r\n\nSullivan's theories.\r\n\n          Sullivan  rejects  Vernay's  arguments that  we  should\r\n\nreverse the district court's conclusions with respect to Vernay's\r\n\nliability to him.  Moreover, Sullivan  contends that the district\r\n\ncourt correctly did not bar his recovery due to his  own conduct.\r\n\nSullivan also  argues that  the district  court erred  in finding\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nthat Young  Brothers was not  liable under theories of  breach of\r\n\nwarranty  and  strict  liability for  product  defects,  although\r\n\nSullivan  contends that  the district  court correctly  concluded\r\n\nthat  Young Brothers was  not liable  under a  negligence theory.\r\n\nFor  its part,  Young  Brothers argues  that  the district  court\r\n\ncorrectly decided that it was not liable and that Vernay was.\r\n\n          We  address   first  Vernay's  liability,   then  Young\r\n\nBrothers'  liability.  Issues of Sullivan's conduct are discussed\r\n\nas they apply to the other two parties' liability.  Following our\r\n\nliability discussions, we turn to issues of damages.\r\n\n                      A. Vernay's Liability\r                                A. Vernay's Liability\r\n\n          The  district court found  that Vernay breached certain\r\n\nexpress and  implied warranties in  the sale of the  Vernatube to\r\n\nYoung Brothers, all in violation of Me. Rev. Stat. Ann.  tit. 11,\r\n\n   2-313   (express   warranty),  2-314   (implied   warranty  of\r\n\nmerchantability),  and 2-315 (implied  warranty of fitness  for a\r\n\nparticular  purpose), and  that  Vernay  was  also  liable  under\r\n\ntheories  of strict liability for product defects and negligence.\r\n\nThe  district court  arrived  at  its  conclusions  after  making\r\n\nextensive findings  regarding the  Vernatube and  the VPIS  which\r\n\nwere  based  both  on  trial  testimony,  exhibits  entered  into\r\n\nevidence and the parties' joint stipulations, dated  June 1, 1994\r\n\n(\"Joint  Stipulations\").   On appeal,  Vernay  challenges, for  a\r\n\nnumber of reasons,  the district court's conclusions  that Vernay\r\n\nis liable  for breach  of express warranties,  breach of  implied\r\n\nwarranties, and strict liability for product defects.  \r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\n                    Breach of Express Warranty\r                              Breach of Express Warranty\r                                                        \r\n\n          Pursuant to the Maine  Uniform Commercial Code, express\r\n\nwarranties by  the seller  are created  by \"[a]ny affirmation  of\r\n\nfact or promise made by the seller to the buyer which  relates to\r\n\nthe goods  and becomes part  of the basis  of the bargain.\"   Me.\r\n\nRev. Stat.  Ann. tit.  11,   2-313.   Furthermore,  \"[i]t is  not\r\n\nnecessary to the creation of  an express warranty that the seller\r\n\nuse formal words such as 'warrant' or 'guarantee' or that he have\r\n\na  specific  intention to  make  a warranty,  but  an affirmation\r\n\nmerely of the value of the goods or a statement purporting  to be\r\n\nmerely the seller's opinion or commendation of the goods does not\r\n\ncreate  a warranty.\"    Id.   In  general,  the question  whether\r                                    \r\n\ncertain language creates an express warranty is  reserved for the\r\n\ntrier of fact.   See Cuthbertson  v. Clark Equip.  Co., 448  A.2d\r                                                                \r\n\n315,  320  (Me.  1982).  Below,  Sullivan contended  that:    the\r\n\nVernatube had insufficient nominal  wall thickness; the Vernatube\r\n\nwas porous  on the  inner surface,  affecting the  tube's overall\r\n\nintegrity; and the longitudinal strength was insufficient for the\r\n\napplication and could have been  increased through changes in the\r\n\ntube's  manufacture.    Based  on  an  extensive  review  of  the\r\n\ntechnical  evidence presented, the district court agreed, finding\r\n\nthat  the  deficiency  in  the  nominal  wall thickness  and  the\r\n\nsubstandard longitudinal strength were  not what Vernay expressly\r\n\nwarranted in  its VPIS, and that  the porous nature of  the inner\r\n\nsurface  of the  Vernatube contributed  to  the weakening  of the\r\n\nfibers and  the fatigue  crack which caused  the vessel  to sink.\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nThe district court ultimately concluded that the \"breach of these\r\n\nexpress  warranties was collectively the cause  of the failure of\r\n\nthis  section  of  Vernatube.\"   Vernay  challenges  the district\r\n\ncourt's conclusion that  it breached an express  warranty arising\r\n\nfrom the VPIS on several grounds.  We reject all of them.\r\n\n          First,  Vernay points  out  that neither  Sullivan  nor\r\n\nYoung  Brothers pled any violation of an express warranty arising\r\n\nfrom the VPIS.  Sullivan only pled a violation of the express and\r\n\nimplied  warranties   of  merchantability   and  fitness   for  a\r\n\nparticular purpose, and  Young Brothers only pled a  breach of an\r\n\nimplied warranty of merchantability.  Accordingly, Vernay argues,\r\n\nthe district  court erred  when it  held Vernay breached  certain\r\n\nexpress warranties made in the VPIS.  We do not agree.  \r\n\n          Under Fed. R. Civ. P.  15(b),2 we find that the express\r\n\nwarranty  arising from  the VPIS  was  tried by  implied, if  not\r\n\nexpress, consent  of the parties  and, thus, we \"treat[]  [it] in\r\n\nall respects as  if [it] had been raised  in the pleadings.\" Id.;\r                                                                          \r\n\nsee  Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller  &amp; Mary K. Kane, Federal\r                                                                           \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(b) provides, in pertinent part: \r\n\n            When issues not  raised by the  pleadings\r\n            are tried  by express or  implied consent\r\n            of the  parties, they shall be treated in\r\n            all  respects as if  they had been raised\r\n            in the  pleadings. Such amendment  of the\r\n            pleadings  as may  be necessary  to cause\r\n            them to  conform to  the evidence  and to\r\n            raise  these  issues  may  be  made  upon\r\n            motion  of  any party  at any  time, even\r\n            after judgment; but  failure so to  amend\r\n            does  not affect the  result of the trial\r\n            of these issues. \r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nPractice and Procedure: Civil 2d    1493 (1990) (\"Rule 15(b) does\r                                          \r\n\nnot require that  a conforming amendment be made and  there is no\r\n\npenalty for  failing to  do so.\").   In his  pretrial memorandum,\r\n\nSullivan  argues  that Vernay  Products breached  certain express\r\n\nwarranties in connection with  the sale of the Vernatube,  citing\r\n\nto Me.  Rev. Stat.  Ann. tit. 11,    2-313 and  referring to  the\r\n\nstatements made in the VPIS.  Although in its pretrial memorandum\r\n\nVernay  did point  out, albeit  somewhat in  passing and  without\r\n\nreference  to any  legal rule, that  Sullivan had  not originally\r\n\npled breach of an express warranty arising from the VPIS, we find\r\n\nthat,  because  issues  relating  to  both  express  and  implied\r\n\nwarranties arising from  the VPIS were tried  interchangeably and\r\n\nwithout  further objection,  the breach  of  an express  warranty\r\n\narising  from the  VPIS was  tried  by implied,  if not  express,\r\n\nconsent under  Fed. R.  Civ. P.  15(b).   The  record shows  that\r\n\nVernay did not  object to the presentation of  evidence regarding\r\n\nexpress  warranties made  in  the VPIS,  and  that Vernay  itself\r\n\nintroduced considerable testimony regarding its interpretation of\r\n\nthe VPIS.  \r\n\n          Furthermore,   we    are   unpersuaded    by   Vernay's\r\n\ncounterargument  that, because  the VPIS  was  only admitted  and\r\n\ndiscussed for purposes of the strict liability claim's failure to\r\n\nwarn issue, its failure to object to the admission of the VPIS or\r\n\nto related testimony cannot be deemed an implied consent to amend\r\n\nthe pleadings.  Not only was the evidence and testimony regarding\r\n\nthe VPIS related directly to the breach of warranties claims that\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nSullivan and Young Brothers had  pled, but Vernay failed to raise\r\n\nany sort  of objection or  state for the  record that it  was not\r\n\nconsenting to Sullivan's claim of a breach of an express warranty\r\n\nclaim arising  from  the VPIS.    In addition,  Vernay's  counsel\r\n\nexplicitly admitted to  the breach of warranties  claims, without\r\n\nreference to the  fact that an express warranty  arising from the\r\n\nVPIS had not  been pled:   In support  of defendants' motion  for\r\n\njudgment  as  a  matter  of law,  Vernay's  counsel  stated  that\r\n\n\"[w]ell, we have a  breach of contract account here,  but I would\r\n\nsay  there is  [an] absolute  defense to  Vernay under  [Me. Rev.\r\n\nStat. Ann. tit. 11,  ] 2-607(3)\" given that Vernay  was not given\r\n\nnotice of the defect.  (6/21/94 Tr. p. 223).   In any event, even\r\n\nassuming,   arguendo,  that  Vernay  had  not  consented  to  the\r                              \r\n\namendment of the pleadings, it does not affect the outcome of the\r\n\nappeal as  we nonetheless  affirm the  district court's  findings\r\n\nthat Vernay breached the express and implied warranties which had\r\n\noriginally been pled.\r\n\n          Second, Vernay argues that, even if a breach of express\r\n\nwarranty  is deemed  to have  been  pled, there  was no  evidence\r\n\nproffered at trial to show that either Young Brothers or Sullivan\r\n\nrelied on  the representations made in  the VPIS.  In  support of\r\n\nhis argument, Vernay cites Phillips v. Ripley &amp; Fletcher Co., 541\r                                                                      \r\n\nA.2d 946, 950 (Me. 1988),  and cases from other jurisdictions for\r\n\nthe  proposition that  reliance  is  an element  of  a breach  of\r\n\nexpress warranty claim in Maine.   As Phillips notes, comments to\r                                                        \r\n\nMe.  Rev.  Stat.  Ann.  tit.   11,     2-313  suggest  that  \"the\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\nrequirement that the affirmation become part of the 'basis of the\r\n\nbargain'  is meant to continue the  uniform sales act requirement\r\n\nthat the purchaser must show reliance on the affirmation in order\r\n\nto make out a cause of action for breach of warranty.\"  Phillips,\r                                                                          \r\n\n541 A.2d at 950 (internal citations omitted).  \r\n\n          Although the district court did not explicitly  discuss\r\n\nreliance as an element of the breach of express warranty claim in\r\n\nits memorandum, testimony was given that Young Brothers relied on\r\n\nthe VPIS.   The  following  colloquy ensued  between counsel  for\r\n\nSullivan and Colby Young, part  owner and vice president of Young\r\n\nBrothers:\r\n\n          Q.  Is it  fair to  state that  you made  the\r\n              decision  to  change   your  installation\r\n              practice and use vernatubing for your wet\r\n              exhaust    tube     based    upon     the\r\n              representations set forth in the [VPIS]?\r\n          A.  Yes, sir.\r\n                              . . . \r\n          Q.  So [sic] in other words, your decision to\r\n              use  the  vernatube  was based  upon  the\r\n              content of the  information set forth  in\r\n              [the VPIS]? \r\n          A.  That's correct.\r\n                              . . .\r\n          Q.  If Vernay  in its  brochure had told  you\r\n              that a  rigid installation  was improper,\r\n              you wouldn't have done it?\r\n          A.  Certainly not.  It never would have  been\r\n              done. \r\n\n(6/21/94 Tr.  T. at 199,  203).  Following  up on this  and other\r\n\ntestimony by  Young, counsel for Vernay engaged  in this exchange\r\n\nwith Young: \r\n\n          Q.  Mr.  Young, you  said that you  relied on\r\n              this document to decide whether or not to\r\n              install Vernay in your  first boat; isn't\r\n              that right?\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\n          A.  That and the  representation from the rep\r\n              [from H &amp; H Propeller], yes.\r\n          Q.  Okay.   So you relied on things that [the\r\n              representative]  from  H  &amp;  H  Propeller\r\n              Shop, Inc. told you?\r\n          A.  In fact, he brought it to us and asked us\r\n              to try it, yes.\r\n          Q.  You say that [the VPIS] is the only thing\r\n              that Vernay gave you?\r\n          A.  Yes.\r\n\n(6/21/94 Tr. T. at 207).  \r\n\n          Based on Young's testimony, including cross-examination\r\n\nby  Vernay's counsel, we  conclude that the  district court could\r\n\nhave reasonably inferred  reliance.  Thus, although  the district\r\n\ncourt  did not explicitly address reliance, we nonetheless affirm\r\n\nthe  breach of  an express  warranty  claim based  on the  record\r\n\nevidence and  the failure  of Vernay's counsel  to object  to it,\r\n\nfinding that  the district  court's failure  amounts to  harmless\r\n\nerror  in this case, since  the failure to  make findings of fact\r\n\nand conclusions  of law dealt  here with  an issue on  which most\r\n\nrelevant facts are undisputed and  the law can be applied without\r\n\nthe district court's assistance.  See Conservation  Law Found. v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nBusey,  79 F.3d  1250,  1271 (1st  Cir.  1996); Associated  Elec.\r                                                                           \r\n\nCoop., Inc. v.

In Maine,\r\n\n\"[l]ack  of privity between  plaintiff and defendant  shall be no\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\ndefense in any action brought against the manufacturer, seller or\r\n\nsupplier of  goods for breach  of warranty,  express or  implied,\r\n\nalthough the  plaintiff  did  not purchase  the  goods  from  the\r\n\ndefendant, if the plaintiff was  a person whom the  manufacturer,\r\n\nseller or supplier might reasonably have expected to use, consume\r\n\nor be affected by the goods.\"  Me. Rev. Stat.  Ann. tit. 11,   2-\r\n\n318 (1995); see  Stanley v. Schiavi Mobile Homes,  Inc., 462 A.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n1144,  1147 n.4 (Me.  1983) (noting  that lack  of privity  is no\r\n\ndefense in  breach of implied warranty actions).   Although there\r\n\nis a lack of privity between Sullivan and Vernay in that Sullivan\r\n\ndid not purchase the Vernatube directly from Vernay, Sullivan was\r\n\ncertainly a person  whom Vernay might reasonably have expected to\r\n\nuse, or  be affected  by, the Vernatube.   Indeed,  Vernay itself\r\n\nstipulated to  this very  fact.  See  Joint Stipulations,  No. 6.\r                                              \r\n\nEven without the  stipulation, the record supports  this finding.\r\n\nAs Vernay  points out in  its brief, approximately 70-75%  of its\r\n\nproducts are sold directly to boat builders and the rest are sold\r\n\nto  wholesale  distributors  and  engine  dealerships.    H  &amp;  H\r\n\nPropeller Shop  was Vernay's distributor  in Maine and  the parts\r\n\nsupplier  from  which  Young  Brothers  purchased  the  Vernatube\r\n\ninstalled aboard the SEA  FEVER.  As a purchaser of  a new vessel\r\n\nfrom  a Maine boat  building company  which purchased  goods from\r\n\nVernay's  Maine distributor, Sullivan was certainly a person whom\r\n\nVernay might  reasonably expect  to use, or  be affected  by, its\r\n\nproduct.\r\n\n                        Notice Requirement\r                                  Notice Requirement\r                                                    \r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\n          Vernay  contends  that  the  district  court  erred  in\r\n\nholding it liable under a breach of warranty theory, arguing that\r\n\nit cannot be  held responsible for  the damages because  Sullivan\r\n\nfailed to  comply with the  notice requirements set forth  in Me.\r\n\nRev. Stat. Ann. tit. 11,   2-607(3).  That section requires that,\r\n\nwhere the  tender has  been accepted, the  buyer must  notify the\r\n\nseller of any  breach within  a reasonable time  after he or  she\r\n\ndiscovered or should have discovered any breach or be barred from\r\n\nany  remedy.   Id.,   2-607(3).   The \"seller\"  is defined  as \"a\r                            \r\n\nperson who  sells or contracts  to sell  goods.\"  Me.  Rev. Stat.\r\n\nAnn. tit. 11,   2-103(d).  The district court found that Sullivan\r\n\nsatisfied  the  notice  requirement,  because  he notified  Young\r\n\nBrothers, his immediate seller, of the 1991 crack.  \r\n\n          On appeal  Vernay contends --  as it did below  -- that\r\n\nSullivan is  barred from any  remedy because he failed  to notify\r\n\nVernay of the  undisputed 1991 crack which caused  water to enter\r\n\nthe SEA FEVER's  holds.  Vernay argues  as follows:  If  the 1992\r\n\ncrack  is considered  to be  a breach  of any  warranty  then the\r\n\nsimilar 1991 crack must also  be considered a breach and, because\r\n\nit  is  undisputed  that  neither  Sullivan  nor  Young  Brothers\r\n\nprovided Vernay with  any notice of the 1991  crack,3 Sullivan is\r\n\nbarred from  any remedy.   For support,  Vernay argues  that \"the\r\n\nmajority of courts\"  have held that for claims  of economic loss,\r\n\nremote manufacturers must  be notified,  and that  notice to  the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3   As  the district  court  noted, although  Young Brothers  did\r\nnotify H  &amp; H Propeller of the  1991 crack, H &amp; H  did not notify\r\nVernay.\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\nseller  of the  product  alone is  insufficient  for purposes  of\r\n\nSection 2-607(3).  The consequence of not receiving notice of the\r\n\nfirst crack, Vernay explains, is that it never had an opportunity\r\n\nto offer a cure.  See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 11,   2-605.  The\r                               \r\n\ndistrict  court rejected Vernay's  argument, concluding  that the\r\n\nmajority of courts in fact have held that buyers need only notify\r\n\ntheir  immediate  sellers.    Sullivan,  893  F.  Supp.  at  1159\r                                                \r\n\n(collecting cases).  However, Vernay  disputes the cases that the\r\n\ndistrict court cited,  and argues that a majority  of courts hold\r\n\nthe opposite.\r\n\n          However, even  accepting, arguendo,  Vernay's argument,\r                                                      \r\n\nthe record supports  the conclusion that Vernay  had constructive\r\n\nnotice and  knowledge of the 1991  crack.  As the  district court\r\n\nnoted when denying defendants' motion for judgment as a matter of\r\n\nlaw,  viewing the  evidence in  the light  most favorable  to the\r\n\nplaintiff -- as the verdict here requires us to -- a  fact finder\r\n\ncould  conclude   that  Vernay   was  effectively   notified  via\r\n\ncommunication  to H  &amp; H  Propeller,  Vernay's representative  in\r\n\nMaine.  The district court  concluded, and we agree, that a  fact\r\n\nfinder could  reasonably infer  that the  representative had  the\r\n\napparent  authority to accept reports  for Vernay and that notice\r\n\ngiven to  that agent  was effectively  constructive knowledge  to\r\n\nVernay, who  retained that representative and that company as its\r\n\nexclusive representative in Maine.\r\n\n          Finally, Vernay raises an additional  argument based on\r\n\nthe district  court's finding  that Sullivan was  aware of  a new\r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\ncrack in 1992 which he \"had been meaning to repair.\"   Vernay now\r\n\ncontends that because there is no evidence that Sullivan provided\r\n\nanyone  with notice  of  the  1992 crack  prior  to the  sinking,\r\n\nSullivan is barred from any remedy.  Vernay further contends that\r\n\non the facts  of this case  (namely, that  the 1991 crack  almost\r\n\nresulted in the  sinking of the SEA  FEVER and the new  crack had\r\n\nthe  potential to  do the  same), reasonable  notice of  this new\r\n\ncrack could be nothing less than immediate notice.\r\n\n          Vernay has  failed to  adduce legal  authority for  the\r\n\nproposition that, under Maine's version  of Article 2 of the UCC,\r\n\nSullivan's failure to give immediate  notice voids his claim.  In\r\n\ncontrast, an applicable comment to the UCC states that:\r\n\n            \"[a]  reasonable  time\"  for notification\r\n            from a retail consumer is to be judged by\r\n            different standards  [than notice  from a\r\n            merchant  buyer], . .  . for the  rule of\r\n            requiring  notification  is  designed  to\r\n            defeat  commercial  bad   faith,  not  to\r\n            deprive a  good  faith  consumer  of  his\r\n            remedy.\r\n\nUniform Commercial Code,   2-607.4 cmt.   In this case, where the\r\n\n1992 crack had  given Sullivan no indication of  trouble, we must\r\n\nreject Vernay's \"immediate  notice\" gloss on what  constitutes \"a\r\n\nreasonable  time.\"   To  adopt  Vernay's  reading  would  require\r\n\nconsumers to give  notice of problems that amount  to little more\r\n\nthan  a nuisance,  and would  tend to  defeat worthy  claims with\r\n\nlittle off-setting benefit to anyone.   Even if consumers were to\r\n\ncomply  with this  burden, manufacturers  would  be deluged  with\r\n\nnotices about  harmless defects.   In light of the  UCC comment's\r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\napt  caution   regarding  the   notice  requirement  and   retail\r\n\nconsumers, we think that it would  be unwise to shift the balance\r\n\nin this flow of information in the manner that Vernay urges.\r\n\n          As  a result, we uphold the district court's conclusion\r\n\nthat  Vernay was  liable  for breach  of  its express  warranties\r\n\nregarding the Vernatube's nominal wall thickness, porosity of its\r\n\ninner surface, and longitudinal strength.  Furthermore, given the\r\n\nexpert  testimony heard  by the  district court,  its finding  of\r\n\ncausation cannot be  clear error.  See Clement  v. United States,\r                                                                          \r\n\n980 F.2d 48, 53 (1st.

Brown,\r                                                                          \r\n\n623  A.2d 1270, 1271 (Me.  1993) (stating that \"[p]roximate cause\r\n\nis  a question  of fact\"  and \"[w]e  will not  disturb the  trial\r\n\ncourt's finding of fact unless  there is no competent evidence in\r\n\nthe record to support it\");  LaFerriere v.

Because  we  uphold  the district  court's\r\n\nfinding of  Vernay's liability based  on a breach of  its express\r\n\nwarranty, we need not consider Vernay's liability with respect to\r\n\ntheories of  implied warranty, or  with respect to  negligence or\r\n\nstrict  liability for  product  defects.4   See Dudley  v.

As  Vernay\r\nitself  states in  its brief,  an  insurer is  a \"volunteer\"  and\r\nwithout rights to  subrogation only if it pays  its insureds when\r\nit  clearly has no  obligation to do  so under its  policy.  See,\r                                                                          \r\ne.g., Allstate Ins. Co. v. Quinn Constr. Co., 713 F.

The\r\npurpose of this rule is \"to encourage insurers to settle promptly\r\nclaims that appear to be valid.\"  Id.  To be sure, Vernay asserts\r                                               \r\nthat because Sullivan's policy states that recovery shall be made\r\n\"provided such  loss or damage has not  resulted from want of due\r\ndiligence by  the assured,\" the  insurer acted as a  volunteer in\r\npaying  Sullivan  despite  his negligent  conduct.

Vernay\r\n\ncontends  that Sullivan's  own actions  were  an intervening  and\r\n\nsuperseding  cause of  his loss.   Because  proximate cause  is a\r\n\nfactual inquiry,  the district court's  determination must  stand\r\n\nunless it  is clearly  erroneous.   See Clement,  980 F.2d at  53\r                                                         \r\n\n(\"[c]ausation-in-fact is,  by definition a factual inquiry\" under\r\n\nMaine law); Greenstreet, 623 A.2d at 1271 (\"[p]roximate cause  is\r                                 \r\n\na question of fact\").\r\n\n          The district court ruled that the breach of the express\r\n\nwarranties  was  collectively the  cause  of the  failure  of the\r\n\nVernatube,  which   in  turn  caused   the  complained-of   harm.\r\n\nSullivan, 893  F. Supp.  at 1159.    Vernay correctly  identifies\r                  \r\n\nevidence  that Sullivan's own  actions could have  contributed to\r\n\nthe  SEA  FEVER's sinking.    However,  the  district court  also\r\n\nconsidered expert  testimony regarding  the Vernatube's  physical\r\n\ndefects and their role in  the SEA FEVER's sinking.  Furthermore,\r\n\nthe  district  court  reduced  Sullivan's  recovery  accordingly.\r\n\nBased  on our review of this evidence, we conclude that there was\r\n\nsufficient evidence  to render  the  district court's  conclusion\r\n\nreasonable.   As a result,  we cannot conclude that  the district\r\n\ncourt's finding that Vernay  proximately caused the complained-of\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nany  consequent argument  that the  insurer  was not  necessarily\r\nrequired to pay  Sullivan was not sufficiently compelling to meet\r\nthe legal standard that the  insurer clearly had no obligation to\r                                                      \r\npay.\r\n\n                               -23-\r\r\n\nharm was clearly erroneous.   Accordingly, we affirm the district\r\n\ncourt's  conclusion that Vernay is liable  to Sullivan for breach\r\n\nof its express warranty.\r\n\n          We  note in  passing that  we do  not opine  on whether\r\n\nSullivan's recovery  under a  breach of  express warranty  theory\r\n\ncould  appropriately  be  reduced  under  comparative  negligence\r\n\nprinciples, since Sullivan  does not cross-appeal  the reduction.\r\n\nAs the district court properly noted, whether such a reduction is\r\n\npermissible  regarding a  breach-of-warranty theory  is an  \"open\r\n\nquestion  under Maine  law.\"    Sullivan, 893  F.

Young Brothers' Liability\r                            B.

Sullivan also\r\n\nargues that  the district court  correctly found no  liability on\r\n\nYoung  Brothers' part  under  a negligence  theory, but  that the\r\n\ndistrict court  erred in  finding Young  Brothers not liable  for\r\n\nbreach of implied warranty.

First,  Vernay argues  that\r\n\nYoung Brothers  was negligent in  its design and building  of the\r\n\nSEA  FEVER.   Second,  Vernay contends  that  Young Brothers  was\r\n\nnegligent in its  conduct after the SEA FEVER  had been delivered\r\n\nto Sullivan.\r\n\n          With  respect to Vernay's first argument, we affirm the\r\n\ndistrict court's conclusion that Young Brothers was not negligent\r\n\nin designing and building the SEA FEVER.  Vernay points  out that\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nbreach of express warranty action\").\r\n\n                               -25-\r\r\n\nYoung  Brothers used  a  rigid  installation  of  the  Vernatube,\r\n\ndisregarding  written  boat  building  standards,  and  that  the\r\n\ndistrict court heard testimony  disapproving of such installation\r\n\nmethods.  But  the district court also heard  testimony of others\r\n\nin the industry to the  effect that the installation of Vernatube\r\n\nin the SEA FEVER was typical  of customary installation practices\r\n\nin Maine7 -- and  custom within the boat building profession is a\r\n\nfactor relevant to  the standard of care owed  by Young Brothers.\r\n\nSee Restatement  (Second) of Torts    294A (1965).   The district\r             \r\n\ncourt  also heard  testimony as  to  the relatively  trouble-free\r\n\noperation  of Vernatube generally with rigid installation.  While\r\n\nVernay may wish it otherwise,  ours is not the task  of crediting\r\n\nwitnesses,  see Coastal Fuels  of Puerto Rico,  Inc. v. Caribbean\r                                                                           \r\n\nPetroleum Corp.,  79 F.3d  182, 195 (1st  Cir. 1996);  Wytrwal v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nSaco  Sch.

Hooper, 60 F.2d  737, 740 (2d  Cir.) (L. Hand,  J.)\r                              \r\n\n(stating that  the court  should not find  that the  \"whole [boat\r\n\nbuilding] calling may  have unduly lagged\" without  good reason),\r\n\ncert. denied, 287 U.S. 662 (1932).\r                      \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n7   In fact, another boat builder testified that he had been  \"in\r\nevery  boatyard up and  down the Maine  coast\" and  he had \"never\r\nseen it  done differently.\"  See Sullivan,  893 F.

Id.  \r                                      \r\n\n                               -26-\r\r\n\n          Vernay also  contends that Young Brothers was negligent\r\n\nin failing to notify Vernay regarding the 1991 crack.  We dismiss\r\n\nthis  argument for  the same  reason that  we  dismissed Vernay's\r\n\nclaim that Vernay  is not liable because  it was not  notified of\r\n\nthe 1991 crack.   In fact, Sullivan notified  Young Brothers, and\r\n\nYoung Brothers in turn notified  H &amp; H Propellers, Vernay's Maine\r\n\ndistributor and the  supplier from whom Young  Brothers purchased\r\n\nthe Vernatube.  In light  of this notice to Vernay's distributor,\r\n\nwe cannot  accept the contention that Young  Brothers was somehow\r\n\nnegligent in its handling of the  1991 crack.  Vernay also argues\r\n\nthat Young  Brothers was  negligent in not  finding the  cause of\r\n\nthis  crack; however,  one must  possess  a duty  before one  can\r\n\nbreach it,  and as  Vernay has not  pointed to  authority showing\r\n\nthat Young Brothers owed a duty beyond notifying its supplier, we\r\n\nreject  this contention.   As  a result,  we conclude  that Young\r\n\nBrothers cannot be held liable under a negligence theory.\r\n\n              Implied Warranty and Strict Liability\r                        Implied Warranty and Strict Liability\r                                                             \r\n\n          Vernay  argues that the district court erred in finding\r\n\nVernay liable  and Young  Brothers not  liable under  theories of\r\n\nimplied warranty  and strict liability.   Vernay argues  that the\r\n\ndistrict court erred by concluding that Vernay was liable under a\r\n\ntheory of implied warranty, while  Young Brothers did not  breach\r\n\nits  implied  warranty that  the  vessel  would  be fit  for  its\r\n\nordinary use.  Additionally,  according to Vernay, both  of these\r\n\nparties  participated  in  the sale  of  the  allegedly defective\r\n\nVernatube, and therefore, it is  impossible for Vernay to be held\r\n\n                               -27-\r\r\n\nstrictly  liable  and Young  Brothers  not  to be  held  strictly\r\n\nliable.\r\n\n          The  district  court  correctly  concluded  that  Young\r\n\nBrothers  could not  be found  liable  for breach  of an  implied\r\n\nwarranty of merchantability.  Maine's version of Article 2 of the\r\n\nUCC  provides  that   \"a  warranty  that   the  goods  shall   be\r\n\nmerchantable  is implied  in a  contract  for their  sale if  the\r\n\nseller is a  merchant with respect to  goods of that kind.\"   Me.\r                                                                   \r\n\nRev. Stat. Ann. tit. 11,  2-314(1) (emphasis added).  In Suminski\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Maine Appliance Warehouse, 602 A.2d 1173 (Me. 1992), the Maine\r                                      \r\n\nLaw Court  interpreted the phrase  \"goods of that kind.\"   Id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n1175 (discussing section 2-314(1)).  The Law Court concluded that\r\n\na defective  switch that did not  affect use of a  television for\r\n\nmore than a  year did not  render a seller of  televisions liable\r\n\nfor breach of  an implied warranty.  In particular, the Law Court\r\n\nstated that\r\n\n            the  sale of  a  major  appliance with  a\r\n            switch  that fails more than a year later\r\n            cannot support a finding  that the entire\r\n            appliance was  unmerchantable when  sold.\r\n            To   use   an  automotive   example,   an\r\n            unmerchantable battery may  not render an\r\n            entire vehicle unmerchantable.\r\n\nSuminski, 602 A.2d at 1175.   We conclude, similarly, that in the\r                  \r\n\ninstant  case, where the Vernatube did  not impede use of the SEA\r\n\nFEVER for more than one year, and Young Brothers sells boats, not\r\n\nVernatube, Young Brothers cannot be  held liable for breach of an\r\n\nimplied warranty of fitness for ordinary purposes.\r\n\n                               -28-\r\r\n\n          However,  we  cannot  agree with  the  district court's\r\n\nconclusion  that  Young  Brothers  was  not  strictly  liable  to\r\n\nSullivan.  Maine's strict liability statute provides that\r\n\n            [o]ne who sells any goods  or products in\r\n            a   defective   condition    unreasonably\r\n            dangerous to the user or consumer  or his\r\n            property  is  subject  to  liability  for\r\n            physical harm thereby caused  to a person\r\n            whom the manufacturer, seller or supplier\r\n            might  reasonably have  expected to  use,\r\n            consume or be  affected by the goods,  or\r\n            to  his property  . .  .  . This  section\r\n            applies although the seller has exercised\r\n            all possible care in  the preparation and\r\n            sale  of  his  product  and  the  user or\r\n            consumer has not  bought the product from\r\n            or entered into  any contractual relation\r\n            with the seller.\r\n\nMe. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 14,   221.  The district court concluded\r\n\nthat  Young Brothers was  not strictly liable  because \"the rigid\r\n\ninstallation of SEA FEVER's exhaust system was not a cause of the\r                                                                    \r\n\nfailure in the Vernatube.\"  Sullivan, 893 F. Supp. at 1155.  This\r                                              \r\n\nconclusion  cannot  be  reconciled with  the  statute's  explicit\r\n\ndirection that a seller's  liability attaches notwithstanding the\r\n\nseller's  exercise  of \"all  possible  care.\"   If  the Vernatube\r\n\nsection was  \"defective\"  and \"unreasonably  dangerous,\"  as  the\r\n\ndistrict court  suggests in its  opinion, it would  be immaterial\r\n\nthat  Young  Brothers'  own  actions  did  not  cause  Sullivan's\r\n\ninjuries.   As  a result,  we  must vacate  the district  court's\r\n\njudgment that Young  Brothers was not liable to  Sullivan under a\r\n\nstrict liability theory.\r\n\n          Young  Brothers'  sole apparent  argument to  rebut the\r\n\nconclusion that it is strictly  liable to Sullivan is that, based\r\n\n                               -29-\r\r\n\non Suminski,  Young Brothers'  should be  considered a  seller of\r                     \r\n\nboats,  not the  Vernatube in  the  boats.   As discussed  above,\r\n\nSuminski  applies  on its  face  to allegations  that  an implied\r                  \r\n\nwarranty of merchantability has been violated, not to theories of\r\n\nstrict liability.   Suminski, 602 A.2d at 1175.  We decline to so\r                                      \r\n\ngreatly extend  Suminski's reach, and  as a result we  must grant\r                                  \r\n\njudgment to  Sullivan against  Young Brothers under  a theory  of\r\n\nstrict liability.  As the parties have neither briefed nor argued\r\n\nMaine indemnification  law among  tortfeasors, we  remand to  the\r\n\ndistrict court for further  proceedings regarding Young Brothers'\r\n\nrights to indemnity from Sullivan.    \r\n\n                           C.

In particular, Vernay  takes issue with\r\n\nthe district  court's choice  of the cost  of repair  rather than\r\n\ndiminution in  the value  of the damaged  property.   Under Maine\r\n\nlaw, both measures may  be used to  prove the amount of  damages.\r\n\nSee Paine v. Spottiswoode, 612 A.2d 235, 240 (Me. 1992).\r                                   \r\n\n          \"Generally, we  will  not substitute  our judgment  for\r\n\nthat of  the  [factfinder]  in  assessing damages  and  will  not\r\n\ndisturb the [factfinder's]  damage award unless  that award is  a\r\n\nproduct  of bias, prejudice,  improper influence, or  was reached\r\n\nunder a mistake of law or  in disregard of the facts.\"   Bradford\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.

In  the present\r                                     \r\n\ncase, we think  that the district court was  justified in relying\r\n\non   the   undisputed   costs   of   Plaintiff's   initial   loss\r\n\ninvestigation,  the cost  of a  salvor  to raise  the SEA  FEVER,\r\n\nPlaintiff's  repair costs  for the  vessel's  machinery, and  the\r\n\ninsurer's estimate of water damage to the deck and superstructure\r\n\nof the vessel.  As  a result, we do  not think that the  district\r\n\ncourt's estimate of Plaintiff's loss, reduced for Plaintiff's own\r\n\ncomparative negligence,8 of  $54,318.68 can be said  to have been\r\n\nmade in disregard of the facts.  And certainly, no contention has\r\n\nbeen made  that the award was  the product of  bias, prejudice or\r\n\nimproper influence.  \r\n\n          However,  we conclude  that a  mistake  of law  compels\r\n\nreduction of the  award by $5,000 -- the amount of the settlement\r\n\nbetween H  &amp; H Propellers and Sullivan.   Under Maine Law, when a\r\n\nperson seeks recovery  for property damage caused by  two or more\r\n\nparties, if a settlement  or release is made with one party, \"the\r\n\ntrial judge shall reduce the verdict [against the non-settling or\r\n\nnon-releasing  party  or  parties]  by  an  amount  equal to  the\r\n\nsettlement with or the consideration for the release of the other\r\n\n[party or parties].\"  Emery Waterhouse Co. v.

The vessel's owner and operator, Rodney Sullivan (\"Sullivan\"), by his insurer, brought this suit to recover for damages sustained due to the SEA FEVER's sinking.  Sullivan brought suit against Vernay Products, Inc.  (\"Vernay\") and Young Brothers and Company Inc.  (\"Young Brothers\") under theories of strict liability, negligence, and breach of implied and express warranties.  Young Brothers crossclaimed against Vernay for indemnification and contribution, and Vernay similarly crossclaimed against Young Brothers for indemnification and contribution.  The district court found only Vernay to be liable for the damages caused by the SEA FEVER's sinking and awarded damages to Sullivan in the amount of $54,318.68.  On the crossclaim, it entered judgment in favor of Young Brothers.  Before us is Vernay's appeal of the district court's judgment, damage award, and denial of its motion for summary judgment and motions for judgment as a matter of law.  Also before us is Sullivan's cross-appeal of the district court's finding that Young Brothers was not liable.  For the reasons stated below, we affirm, in part, and reverse, in part, the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We take the facts, particularly the more technical aspects, almost verbatim from the district court's detailed opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SEA FEVER is a forty-foot, fiberglass hull lobster boat built by Young Brothers in 1989, which Sullivan purchased new from Young Brothers in February 1990 for $122,000.  Sullivan added various items of gear and furnishings at a cost of approximately $10,000.  Young Brothers built the SEA FEVER with a wet exhaust system, which was composed, in part, of six-inch diameter Vernatube fiberglass marine wet exhaust tubing manufactured by Vernay Products (the \"Vernatube\"), which is a manufacturer of various fiberglass components of marine wet exhaust systems.  H &amp; H Propeller Shop (\"H &amp; H Propeller\" or \"H &amp; H\"),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Vernay's distributor in Maine, was the parts supplier from which Young Brothers purchased the Vernatube installed aboard the SEA FEVER.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SEA FEVER's wet exhaust system was constructed with a fifteen-foot length of Vernatube.  Because Vernatube is sold in ten-foot lengths, Young Brothers fiberglassed together a ten-foot and a five-foot length of Vernatube, making, in effect, a single length of tube.  This span of Vernatube was connected to the engine at the exhaust manifold by a flexible rubber hose and rigidly installed in the hull of the vessel by fiberglass where the Vernatube passed through the fish hold bulkhead, the lazarette bulkhead, and the transom.  Aft of the manifold, it was also fiberglassed to each of the two bulkheads and the transom and the Vernatube exhaust was supported by a 3/4-inch marine plywood bracket lined with urethane rubber at about the midway point of the fish hold.  The district court found that the SEA FEVER's Vernatube wet exhaust system was installed in conformity with generally accepted methods of installation among builders of similar vessels in Maine.  The SEA FEVER was also equipped with a Rule 1500 gallon automatic bilge pump.  This pump, which was capable of discharging up to 1500 gallons of water per hour, could be operated manually or automatically.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan operated the SEA FEVER as a commercial lobster vessel during the 1990 fishing season without significant problems.  In early 1991, Sullivan discovered a crack (the \"1991 crack\") in the portion of the Vernatube exhaust located in the lazarette, which permitted water to enter the vessel to the point of near sinking.  Sullivan discovered the crack because the bilge pump was running more than usual.  At the time, the boat was tied to the dock and fully loaded with 90-100 lobster traps, such that the wet exhaust tubing was completely submerged.  Sullivan notified Young Brothers of this crack, and Young Brothers repaired it by fiberglassing over the break.  Young Brothers also notified H &amp; H Propeller of the crack.  Neither of these companies notified Vernay of this crack, and there was no evidence that Sullivan did.  The cause of this crack was never investigated or discovered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After this repair, the SEA FEVER operated without further problems and Sullivan fished the 1991 season until January 1992.  Thereafter, the SEA FEVER remained at her slip until March 1992, when it was hauled for routine maintenance.  While the SEA FEVER was out of the water, Sullivan did not specifically inspect the exhaust system.  The record shows that the last time he inspected it was at the end of the summer of 1991.  On March 17, 1992, Edward S. Blackmore, a marine surveyor appointed by Sullivan's marine hull insurance company, surveyed the SEA FEVER.  Blackmore found the vessel to be in \"A-1\" condition with a fair market value of $130,000.  Blackmore's inspection included observation of the Vernatube exhaust, which did not have any water in it at the time of the inspection as the SEA FEVER was not loaded.  Nothing unusual was noted about the condition of the Vernatube and Blackmore observed no fractures, no discoloration, and no staining or other evidence of failure in the Vernatube.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the March maintenance and inspection, the SEA FEVER was not operated and remained at her slip until April 4, 1992.  On that day, Sullivan and his sternman made an eight-to-ten-mile trip aboard the SEA FEVER, picking up approximately eighty lobster traps.  After returning, they tied the SEA FEVER to the dock at about 1:00 p.m.  and went home for the day.  Due to the weight of the lobster traps, the end of the exhaust discharge port was several inches under water and, as a result, the Vernatube had water in it.  The SEA FEVER was left with the automatic bilge pump switch in the \"off\" position rather than the \"automatic\" one.  Later that day, at approximately 7:30 p.m., Sullivan was notified that the SEA FEVER had sunk at the dock.  Sullivan retained Wayne Godfrey, a salvage diver from D &amp; G Diving Services, to raise the vessel, which was approximately 90% to 95% submerged.  The SEA FEVER was surveyed by Werner Splettstoesser of Marine Safety Consultants on behalf of Sullivan's insurer, who determined that the SEA FEVER sank due to a crack in the wet exhaust tubing which was visible from the access hatch to the fish hold compartment.  This suit followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 26, 1995, after a four-day bench trial, the district court issued its written decision and order, in which it found that the cause of the SEA FEVER's sinking was a full circumference crack in the Vernatube located a few inches forward of the bulkhead between the lazarette and fish hold (the \"1992 crack\").  The district court further found that this crack was a fatigue failure caused by tension stresses over time exceeding the axial length of the tube.  As there was no other known instance prior to the lawsuit in which a Vernatube had cracked under similar circumstances, much of the trial testimony was directed at the question of whether the 1992 crack had been caused by a defective section of Vernatube or by improper installation of the exhaust system by Young Brothers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After evaluation of expert testimony offered by all three parties, review of the largely technical evidence, and inspection and analysis of the SEA FEVER's Vernatube, the district court found that the ten-foot section of the Vernatube, which developed at least two cracks during a two-year period, was defective.  The district court specifically found that the evidence regarding the Vernatube's porosity, wall thickness, and longitudinal strength \"clearly proves that the section of Vernatube was defective\" and that its defect contributed to the Vernatube's failure in the SEA FEVER.  In particular, the district court found that with respect to these physical measures, the Vernatube did not live up to the specifications described in the Vernay Products Information Sheet (the \"VPIS\").  In making its finding, the district court noted that inspection of the Vernatube revealed several cracks, delamination, and areas of prospective failure, all located in the ten-foot section as well as one area of debonding (i.e., where strands of fiber had come loose).  The district court explicitly ruled out other claimed reasons for the Vernatube's failure, noting that there was no evidence of owner misuse and no indication of Vernatube failures in boats similarly constructed.  Noting that the trial testimony \"clearly established that hundreds of boats of similar design have been constructed with this type of rigid exhaust system without one known failure,\" the district court found that the rigid installation of SEA FEVER's exhaust system was not a cause of the Vernatube's failure and that, therefore, Young Brothers was not strictly liable for its installation of the wet exhaust system.  In making this finding, the district court noted that \"the existence of multiple failures and imperfections within the single ten-foot section of Vernatube, notwithstanding the product's known track record of problem-free similar installations in hundreds of other vessels, supports the conclusion that the SEA FEVER sank because this particular length of tube, rather than its installation, was defective.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the district court held that (i) Vernay's warning against rigid installation, while insufficient, did not give rise to recovery--but Vernay was nonetheless liable under theories of negligence and strict liability based on defects in tubing;  (ii) Sullivan was partially responsible for damage due to his failure to leave his boat's bilge pump in automatic position despite knowing of another crack in the Vernatube exhaust that needed repair;  (iii) Vernay was also liable for breach of express and implied warranties;  (iv) Sullivan's notice to Young Brothers was sufficient to allow recovery for breach of warranty by Vernay;  and (v) Sullivan's recovery would be reduced by 40% to reflect his comparative fault.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court entered an amended judgment on July 28, 1995, based on its earlier decision and order.  The district court had subject matter jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship and satisfaction of the jurisdictional amount.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a).  We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291 (appeals from a district court's final judgment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a bench trial, we review the trier's factual determinations for clear error, see Smith v. F.W. Morse &amp; Co., 76 F.3d 413, 420 (1st Cir.1996);   Cumpiano v. Banco Santander P.R., 902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir.1990);  Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a), but afford plenary review to the trier's formulation of applicable legal rules, see Smith, 76 F.3d at 420;   Johnson v. Watts Regulator Co., 63 F.3d 1129, 1132 (1st Cir.1995).  The jurisprudence of clear error prevents us from ruling anew on factual issues.  See, e.g., Jackson v. Harvard Univ., 900 F.2d 464, 466 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 848, 111 S.Ct. 137, 112 L.Ed.2d 104 (1990);   Keyes v. Secretary of the Navy, 853 F.2d 1016, 1019 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case comprises interrelated issues of liability involving three players.  The basic outline of the flurry of claims is as follows.  Vernay contests the district court's ruling that it was liable under theories of warranty, both express and implied, as well as strict liability for product defects and negligence.  Furthermore, Vernay argues that the district court erred in rejecting the argument that Young Brothers' negligence constitutes a defense to Vernay's liability.  Additionally, Vernay argues that the district court erred in failing to conclude that Sullivan's own conduct should have operated to bar Vernay's liability, rather than occasion a 40% reduction.  Finally, Vernay argues that the district court erred in finding Young Brothers to be without liability under any of Sullivan's theories.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan rejects Vernay's arguments that we should reverse the district court's conclusions with respect to Vernay's liability to him.  Moreover, Sullivan contends that the district court correctly did not bar his recovery due to his own conduct.  Sullivan also argues that the district court erred in finding that Young Brothers was not liable under theories of breach of warranty and strict liability for product defects, although Sullivan contends that the district court correctly concluded that Young Brothers was not liable under a negligence theory.  For its part, Young Brothers argues that the district court correctly decided that it was not liable and that Vernay was.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We address first Vernay's liability, then Young Brothers' liability.  Issues of Sullivan's conduct are discussed as they apply to the other two parties' liability.  Following our liability discussions, we turn to issues of damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Vernay's Liability</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that Vernay breached certain express and implied warranties in the sale of the Vernatube to Young Brothers, all in violation of Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 11, &#167;&#167; 2-313 (express warranty), 2-314 (implied warranty of merchantability), and 2-315 (implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose), and that Vernay was also liable under theories of strict liability for product defects and negligence.  The district court arrived at its conclusions after making extensive findings regarding the Vernatube and the VPIS which were based both on trial testimony, exhibits entered into evidence and the parties' joint stipulations, dated June 1, 1994 (\"Joint Stipulations\").  On appeal, Vernay challenges, for a number of reasons, the district court's conclusions that Vernay is liable for breach of express warranties, breach of implied warranties, and strict liability for product defects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Breach of Express Warranty</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to the Maine Uniform Commercial Code, express warranties by the seller are created by \"[a]ny affirmation of fact or promise made by the seller to the buyer which relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain.\"  Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 11, &#167; 2-313.  Furthermore, \"[i]t is not necessary to the creation of an express warranty that the seller use formal words such as 'warrant' or 'guarantee' or that he have a specific intention to make a warranty, but an affirmation merely of the value of the goods or a statement purporting to be merely the seller's opinion or commendation of the goods does not create a warranty.\"   Id. In general, the question whether certain language creates an express warranty is reserved for the trier of fact.  See Cuthbertson v. Clark Equip.  Co., 448 A.2d 315, 320 (Me.1982).  Below, Sullivan contended that:  the Vernatube had insufficient nominal wall thickness;  the Vernatube was porous on the inner surface, affecting the tube's overall integrity;  and the longitudinal strength was insufficient for the application and could have been increased through changes in the tube's manufacture.  Based on an extensive review of the technical evidence presented, the district court agreed, finding that the deficiency in the nominal wall thickness and the substandard longitudinal strength were not what Vernay expressly warranted in its VPIS, and that the porous nature of the inner surface of the Vernatube contributed to the weakening of the fibers and the fatigue crack which caused the vessel to sink.  The district court ultimately concluded that the \"breach of these express warranties was collectively the cause of the failure of this section of Vernatube.\"   Vernay challenges the district court's conclusion that it breached an express warranty arising from the VPIS on several grounds.  We reject all of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Vernay points out that neither Sullivan nor Young Brothers pled any violation of an express warranty arising from the VPIS.  Sullivan only pled a violation of the express and implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, and Young Brothers only pled a breach of an implied warranty of merchantability.  Accordingly, Vernay argues, the district court erred when it held Vernay breached certain express warranties made in the VPIS.  We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(b),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> we find that the express warranty arising from the VPIS was tried by implied, if not express, consent of the parties and, thus, we \"treat[ ][it] in all respects as if [it] had been raised in the pleadings.\"  Id.;  see Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure:  Civil 2d &#167; 1493 (1990) (\"Rule 15(b) does not require that a conforming amendment be made and there is no penalty for failing to do so.\").  In his pretrial memorandum, Sullivan argues that Vernay Products breached certain express warranties in connection with the sale of the Vernatube, citing to Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 11, &#167; 2-313 and referring to the statements made in the VPIS.  Although in its pretrial memorandum Vernay did point out, albeit somewhat in passing and without reference to any legal rule, that Sullivan had not originally pled breach of an express warranty arising from the VPIS, we find that, because issues relating to both express and implied warranties arising from the VPIS were tried interchangeably and without further objection, the breach of an express warranty arising from the VPIS was tried by implied, if not express, consent under Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(b).  The record shows that Vernay did not object to the presentation of evidence regarding express warranties made in the VPIS, and that Vernay itself introduced considerable testimony regarding its interpretation of the VPIS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, we are unpersuaded by Vernay's counterargument that, because the VPIS was only admitted and discussed for purposes of the strict liability claim's failure to warn issue, its failure to object to the admission of the VPIS or to related testimony cannot be deemed an implied consent to amend the pleadings.  Not only was the evidence and testimony regarding the VPIS related directly to the breach of warranties claims that Sullivan and Young Brothers had pled, but Vernay failed to raise any sort of objection or state for the record that it was not consenting to Sullivan's claim of a breach of an express warranty claim arising from the VPIS.  In addition, Vernay's counsel explicitly admitted to the breach of warranties claims, without reference to the fact that an express warranty arising from the VPIS had not been pled:  In support of defendants' motion for judgment as a matter of law, Vernay's counsel stated that \"[w]ell, we have a breach of contract account here, but I would say there is [an] absolute defense to Vernay under [Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 11, &#167; ] 2-607(3)\" given that Vernay was not given notice of the defect.  (6/21/94 Tr. p. 223).  In any event, even assuming, arguendo, that Vernay had not consented to the amendment of the pleadings, it does not affect the outcome of the appeal as we nonetheless affirm the district court's findings that Vernay breached the express and implied warranties which had originally been pled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Vernay argues that, even if a breach of express warranty is deemed to have been pled, there was no evidence proffered at trial to show that either Young Brothers or Sullivan relied on the representations made in the VPIS.  In support of his argument, Vernay cites  Phillips v. Ripley &amp; Fletcher Co., 541 A.2d 946, 950 (Me.1988), and cases from other jurisdictions for the proposition that reliance is an element of a breach of express warranty claim in Maine.  As  Phillips notes, comments to Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 11, &#167; 2-313 suggest that \"the requirement that the affirmation become part of the 'basis of the bargain' is meant to continue the uniform sales act requirement that the purchaser must show reliance on the affirmation in order to make out a cause of action for breach of warranty.\"   Phillips, 541 A.2d at 950 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the district court did not explicitly discuss reliance as an element of the breach of express warranty claim in its memorandum, testimony was given that Young Brothers relied on the VPIS.  The following colloquy ensued between counsel for Sullivan and Colby Young, part owner and vice president of Young Brothers:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. Is it fair to state that you made the decision to change your installation practice and use vernatubing for your wet exhaust tube based upon the representations set forth in the [VPIS]?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.

So [sic] in other words, your decision to use the vernatube was based upon the content of the information set forth in [the VPIS]?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.  That's correct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>.    .    .    .    .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. If Vernay in its brochure had told you that a rigid installation was improper, you wouldn't have done it?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Certainly not.  It never would have been done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(6/21/94 Tr. T. at 199, 203).  Following up on this and other testimony by Young, counsel for Vernay engaged in this exchange with Young:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. Mr. Young, you said that you relied on this document to decide whether or not to install Vernay in your first boat;  isn't that right?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. That and the representation from the rep [from H &amp; H Propeller], yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. Okay.  So you relied on things that [the representative] from H &amp; H Propeller Shop, Inc. told you?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. In fact, he brought it to us and asked us to try it, yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. You say that [the VPIS] is the only thing that Vernay gave you?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(6/21/94 Tr. T. at 207).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on Young's testimony, including cross-examination by Vernay's counsel, we conclude that the district court could have reasonably inferred reliance.  Thus, although the district court did not explicitly address reliance, we nonetheless affirm the breach of an express warranty claim based on the record evidence and the failure of Vernay's counsel to object to it, finding that the district court's failure amounts to harmless error in this case, since the failure to make findings of fact and conclusions of law dealt here with an issue on which most relevant facts are undisputed and the law can be applied without the district court's assistance.  See Conservation Law Found. v. Busey, 79 F.3d 1250, 1271 (1st Cir.1996);   Associated Elec. Coop., Inc. v. Mid-America Transp. Co., 931 F.2d 1266, 1272 (8th Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Lack of Privity</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We dismiss as meritless Vernay's next claim that Sullivan may not enforce the express warranty because there was no evidence proffered that Sullivan \"ever saw\" the VPIS prior to litigation, let alone relied on its representations.  In Maine, \"[l]ack of privity between plaintiff and defendant shall be no defense in any action brought against the manufacturer, seller or supplier of goods for breach of warranty, express or implied, although the plaintiff did not purchase the goods from the defendant, if the plaintiff was a person whom the manufacturer, seller or supplier might reasonably have expected to use, consume or be affected by the goods.\"  Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 11, &#167; 2-318 (1995);  see Stanley v. Schiavi Mobile Homes, Inc., 462 A.2d 1144, 1147 n. 4 (Me.1983) (noting that lack of privity is no defense in breach of implied warranty actions).  Although there is a lack of privity between Sullivan and Vernay in that Sullivan did not purchase the Vernatube directly from Vernay, Sullivan was certainly a person whom Vernay might reasonably have expected to use, or be affected by, the Vernatube.  Indeed, Vernay itself stipulated to this very fact.  See Joint Stipulations, No. 6. Even without the stipulation, the record supports this finding.  As Vernay points out in its brief, approximately 70-75% of its products are sold directly to boat builders and the rest are sold to wholesale distributors and engine dealerships.  H &amp; H Propeller Shop was Vernay's distributor in Maine and the parts supplier from which Young Brothers purchased the Vernatube installed aboard the SEA FEVER.  As a purchaser of a new vessel from a Maine boat building company which purchased goods from Vernay's Maine distributor, Sullivan was certainly a person whom Vernay might reasonably expect to use, or be affected by, its product.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Notice Requirement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vernay contends that the district court erred in holding it liable under a breach of warranty theory, arguing that it cannot be held responsible for the damages because Sullivan failed to comply with the notice requirements set forth in Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 11, &#167; 2-607(3).  That section requires that, where the tender has been accepted, the buyer must notify the seller of any breach within a reasonable time after he or she discovered or should have discovered any breach or be barred from any remedy.   Id., &#167; 2-607(3).  The \"seller\" is defined as \"a person who sells or contracts to sell goods.\"  Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 11, &#167; 2-103(1)(d).  The district court found that Sullivan satisfied the notice requirement, because he notified Young Brothers, his immediate seller, of the 1991 crack.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal Vernay contends----as it did below----that Sullivan is barred from any remedy because he failed to notify Vernay of the undisputed 1991 crack which caused water to enter the SEA FEVER's holds.  Vernay argues as follows:  If the 1992 crack is considered to be a breach of any warranty then the similar 1991 crack must also be considered a breach and, because it is undisputed that neither Sullivan nor Young Brothers provided Vernay with any notice of the 1991 crack,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Sullivan is barred from any remedy.  For support, Vernay argues that \"the majority of courts\" have held that for claims of economic loss, remote manufacturers must be notified, and that notice to the seller of the product alone is insufficient for purposes of Section 2-607(3).  The consequence of not receiving notice of the first crack, Vernay explains, is that it never had an opportunity to offer a cure.  See Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 11, &#167; 2-605.  The district court rejected Vernay's argument, concluding that the majority of courts in fact have held that buyers need only notify their immediate sellers.   Sullivan, 893 F.Supp. at 1159 (collecting cases).  However, Vernay disputes the cases that the district court cited, and argues that a majority of courts hold the opposite.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, even accepting, arguendo, Vernay's argument, the record supports the conclusion that Vernay had constructive notice and knowledge of the 1991 crack.  As the district court noted when denying defendants' motion for judgment as a matter of law, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff----as the verdict here requires us to--a fact finder could conclude that Vernay was effectively notified via communication to H &amp; H Propeller, Vernay's representative in Maine.  The district court concluded, and we agree, that a fact finder could reasonably infer that the representative had the apparent authority to accept reports for Vernay and that notice given to that agent was effectively constructive knowledge to Vernay, who retained that representative and that company as its exclusive representative in Maine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Vernay raises an additional argument based on the district court's finding that Sullivan was aware of a new crack in 1992 which he \"had been meaning to repair.\"   Vernay now contends that because there is no evidence that Sullivan provided anyone with notice of the 1992 crack prior to the sinking, Sullivan is barred from any remedy.  Vernay further contends that on the facts of this case (namely, that the 1991 crack almost resulted in the sinking of the SEA FEVER and the new crack had the potential to do the same), reasonable notice of this new crack could be nothing less than immediate notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vernay has failed to adduce legal authority for the proposition that, under Maine's version of Article 2 of the UCC, Sullivan's failure to give immediate notice voids his claim.  In contrast, an applicable comment to the UCC states that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p>\"[a] reasonable time\" for notification from a retail consumer is to be judged by different standards [than notice from a merchant buyer], ... for the rule of requiring notification is designed to defeat commercial bad faith, not to deprive a good faith consumer of his remedy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Uniform Commercial Code, &#167; 2-607 cmt. 4.  In this case, where the 1992 crack had given Sullivan no indication of trouble, we must reject Vernay's \"immediate notice\" gloss on what constitutes \"a reasonable time.\"   To adopt Vernay's reading would require consumers to give notice of problems that amount to little more than a nuisance, and would tend to defeat worthy claims with little off-setting benefit to anyone.  Even if consumers were to comply with this burden, manufacturers would be deluged with notices about harmless defects.  In light of the UCC comment's apt caution regarding the notice requirement and retail consumers, we think that it would be unwise to shift the balance in this flow of information in the manner that Vernay urges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result, we uphold the district court's conclusion that Vernay was liable for breach of its express warranties regarding the Vernatube's nominal wall thickness, porosity of its inner surface, and longitudinal strength.  Furthermore, given the expert testimony heard by the district court, its finding of causation cannot be clear error.  See Clement v. United States, 980 F.2d 48, 53 (1st.  Cir.1992) (stating that, under Maine law, causation-in-fact is a factual inquiry);   Greenstreet v. Brown, 623 A.2d 1270, 1271 (Me.1993) (stating that \"[p]roximate cause is a question of fact\" and \"[w]e will not disturb the trial court's finding of fact unless there is no competent evidence in the record to support it\");   Laferriere v. Paradis, 293 A.2d 526, 528-29 (Me.1972).  Because we uphold the district court's finding of Vernay's liability based on a breach of its express warranty, we need not consider Vernay's liability with respect to theories of implied warranty, or with respect to negligence or strict liability for product defects.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  See Dudley v. Bungee Int'l Mfg., 76 F.3d 372, 1996 WL 36977, * 2, (4th Cir.1996) (per curiam) (finding it \"unnecessary to address the question of whether labelling on the [product] created any express warranties,\" since the court had affirmed claim for compensatory damages on a negligence count);   Compton v. Wyle Laboratories, 674 F.2d 206, 208 n. 1 (4th Cir.1982) (declining to address alternate theory of breach of warranty on which plaintiff had prevailed below, since the court of appeals affirmed district court's finding of liability based on negligence);   Drayton v. Jiffee Chem.  Corp., 591 F.2d 352, 358 (6th Cir.1978) (upholding district court's conclusion of liability solely on breach of express warranty grounds, without ruling with respect to court of appeals' concerns regarding district court's conclusions of liability on bases of breach of implied warranty, strict liability and negligent design).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Sullivan's Conduct</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vernay also appeals the district court's finding that its acts were the proximate cause of Sullivan's injuries.  Vernay contends that Sullivan's own actions were an intervening and superseding cause of his loss.  Because proximate cause is a factual inquiry, the district court's determination must stand unless it is clearly erroneous.  See Clement, 980 F.2d at 53 (\"[c]ausation-in-fact is, by definition a factual inquiry\" under Maine law);   Greenstreet, 623 A.2d at 1271 (\"[p]roximate cause is a question of fact\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled that the breach of the express warranties was collectively the cause of the failure of the Vernatube, which in turn caused the complained-of harm.   Sullivan, 893 F.Supp. at 1159.   Vernay correctly identifies evidence that Sullivan's own actions could have contributed to the SEA FEVER's sinking.  However, the district court also considered expert testimony regarding the Vernatube's physical defects and their role in the SEA FEVER's sinking.  Furthermore, the district court reduced Sullivan's recovery accordingly.  Based on our review of this evidence, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to render the district court's conclusion reasonable.  As a result, we cannot conclude that the district court's finding that Vernay proximately caused the complained-of harm was clearly erroneous.  Accordingly, we affirm the district court's conclusion that Vernay is liable to Sullivan for breach of its express warranty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note in passing that we do not opine on whether Sullivan's recovery under a breach of express warranty theory could appropriately be reduced under comparative negligence principles, since Sullivan does not cross-appeal the reduction.  As the district court properly noted, whether such a reduction is permissible regarding a breach-of-warranty theory is an \"open question under Maine law.\"   Sullivan, 893 F.Supp. at 1161 (citing  Dongo v. Banks, 448 A.2d 885, 891 (Me.1982) (expressly declining to decide the issue of whether plaintiff's negligence is or should be a defense to an action for breach of implied warranty)).  The district court reduced Sullivan's recovery under both express warranty and implied warranty theories on the basis of trends in case law applying comparative negligence principles to actions for breach of implied warranties.   Id. We neither adopt nor reject the principle that express warranties implicate the same interests as implied warranties with respect to this question.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Rather, we uphold the reduction of Sullivan's award because of his waiver by failing to cross-appeal.  As a result, we caution that our decision to allow a reduction under an express warranty theory for comparative negligence does not stand for an endorsement of comparative negligence's applicability to express warranty theory-based claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Young Brothers' Liability</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vernay argues that the district court erred in finding no liability on the part of Young Brothers on theories of negligence, implied warranty and strict liability.  Sullivan also argues that the district court correctly found no liability on Young Brothers' part under a negligence theory, but that the district court erred in finding Young Brothers not liable for breach of implied warranty.  We address Young Brothers' liability on each of these theories in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Negligence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vernay argues that the district court erred in finding no liability on Young Brothers' part under a negligence theory.  Vernay makes a two-part argument.  First, Vernay argues that Young Brothers was negligent in its design and building of the SEA FEVER.  Second, Vernay contends that Young Brothers was negligent in its conduct after the SEA FEVER had been delivered to Sullivan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to Vernay's first argument, we affirm the district court's conclusion that Young Brothers was not negligent in designing and building the SEA FEVER.  Vernay points out that Young Brothers used a rigid installation of the Vernatube, disregarding written boat building standards, and that the district court heard testimony disapproving of such installation methods.  But the district court also heard testimony of others in the industry to the effect that the installation of Vernatube in the SEA FEVER was typical of customary installation practices in Maine<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>--and custom within the boat building profession is a factor relevant to the standard of care owed by Young Brothers.  See Restatement (Second) of Torts &#167; 295A (1965).  The district court also heard testimony as to the relatively trouble-free operation of Vernatube generally with rigid installation.  While Vernay may wish it otherwise, ours is not the task of crediting witnesses, see Coastal Fuels of Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Caribbean Petroleum Corp., 79 F.3d 182, 195 (1st Cir.1996);   Wytrwal v. Saco Sch. Bd., 70 F.3d 165, 171 (1st Cir.1995), and the testimony of these witnesses, we conclude, justified the district court's conclusion that Young Brothers acted without negligence, see The T.J. Hooper, 60 F.2d 737, 740 (2d Cir.)  (L.Hand, J.)  (stating that the court should not find that the \"whole [boat building] calling may have unduly lagged\" without good reason), cert. denied, 287 U.S. 662, 53 S.Ct. 220, 77 L.Ed. 571 (1932).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vernay also contends that Young Brothers was negligent in failing to notify Vernay regarding the 1991 crack.  We dismiss this argument for the same reason that we dismissed Vernay's claim that Vernay is not liable because it was not notified of the 1991 crack.  In fact, Sullivan notified Young Brothers, and Young Brothers in turn notified H &amp; H Propellers, Vernay's Maine distributor and the supplier from whom Young Brothers purchased the Vernatube.  In light of this notice to Vernay's distributor, we cannot accept the contention that Young Brothers was somehow negligent in its handling of the 1991 crack.  Vernay also argues that Young Brothers was negligent in not finding the cause of this crack;  however, one must possess a duty before one can breach it, and as Vernay has not pointed to authority showing that Young Brothers owed a duty beyond notifying its supplier, we reject this contention.  As a result, we conclude that Young Brothers cannot be held liable under a negligence theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Implied Warranty and Strict Liability</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vernay argues that the district court erred in finding Vernay liable and Young Brothers not liable under theories of implied warranty and strict liability.  Vernay argues that the district court erred by concluding that Vernay was liable under a theory of implied warranty, while Young Brothers did not breach its implied warranty that the vessel would be fit for its ordinary use.  Additionally, according to Vernay, both of these parties participated in the sale of the allegedly defective Vernatube, and therefore, it is impossible for Vernay to be held strictly liable and Young Brothers not to be held strictly liable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court correctly concluded that Young Brothers could not be found liable for breach of an implied warranty of merchantability.  Maine's version of Article 2 of the UCC provides that \"a warranty that the goods shall be merchantable is implied in a contract for their sale if the seller is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind.\"  Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 11, &#167; 2-314(1) (emphasis added).  In  Suminski v. Maine Appliance Warehouse, 602 A.2d 1173 (Me.1992), the Maine Law Court interpreted the phrase \"goods of that kind.\"   Id. at 1175 (discussing section 2-314(1)).  The Law Court concluded that a defective switch that did not affect use of a television for more than a year did not render a seller of televisions liable for breach of an implied warranty.  In particular, the Law Court stated that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p>the sale of a major appliance with a switch that fails more than a year later cannot support a finding that the entire appliance was unmerchantable when sold.  To use an automotive example, an unmerchantable battery may not render an entire vehicle unmerchantable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Suminski, 602 A.2d at 1175.   We conclude, similarly, that in the instant case, where the Vernatube did not impede use of the SEA FEVER for more than one year, and Young Brothers sells boats, not Vernatube, Young Brothers cannot be held liable for breach of an implied warranty of fitness for ordinary purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, we cannot agree with the district court's conclusion that Young Brothers was not strictly liable to Sullivan.  Maine's strict liability statute provides that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p>[o]ne who sells any goods or products in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer or his property is subject to liability for physical harm thereby caused to a person whom the manufacturer, seller or supplier might reasonably have expected to use, consume or be affected by the goods, or to his property....  This section applies although the seller has exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of his product and the user or consumer has not bought the product from or entered into any contractual relation with the seller.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &#167; 221.  The district court concluded that Young Brothers was not strictly liable because \"the rigid installation of SEA FEVER's exhaust system was not a cause of the failure in the Vernatube.\"   Sullivan, 893 F.Supp. at 1155.   This conclusion cannot be reconciled with the statute's explicit direction that a seller's liability attaches notwithstanding the seller's exercise of \"all possible care.\"   If the Vernatube section was \"defective\" and \"unreasonably dangerous,\" as the district court suggests in its opinion, it would be immaterial that Young Brothers' own actions did not cause Sullivan's injuries.  As a result, we must vacate the district court's judgment that Young Brothers was not liable to Sullivan under a strict liability theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Young Brothers' sole apparent argument to rebut the conclusion that it is strictly liable to Sullivan is that, based on  Suminski, Young Brothers' should be considered a seller of boats, not the Vernatube in the boats.  As discussed above,  Suminski applies on its face to allegations that an implied warranty of merchantability has been violated, not to theories of strict liability.   Suminski, 602 A.2d at 1175.   We decline to so greatly extend  Suminski 's reach, and as a result we must grant judgment to Sullivan against Young Brothers under a theory of strict liability.  As the parties have neither briefed nor argued Maine indemnification law among tortfeasors, we remand to the district court for further proceedings regarding Young Brothers' rights to indemnity from Sullivan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Damages</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vernay also challenges the district court's computation of Sullivan's damages. In particular, Vernay takes issue with the district court's choice of the cost of repair rather than diminution in the value of the damaged property.  Under Maine law, both measures may be used to prove the amount of damages.  See Paine v. Spottiswoode, 612 A.2d 235, 240 (Me.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Generally, we will not substitute our judgment for that of the [factfinder] in assessing damages and will not disturb the [factfinder's] damage award unless that award is a product of bias, prejudice, improper influence, or was reached under a mistake of law or in disregard of the facts.\"   Bradford v. Dumond, 675 A.2d 957, 962 (Me.1996);   Currier v. Cyr, 570 A.2d 1205, 1210 (Me.1990).  The district court \"is entitled to act upon probable and inferential as well as direct and positive proof in determining damages.\"   Bradford, 675 A.2d at 962;   Cyr, 570 A.2d at 1210.   In the present case, we think that the district court was justified in relying on the undisputed costs of Plaintiff's initial loss investigation, the cost of a salvor to raise the SEA FEVER, Plaintiff's repair costs for the vessel's machinery, and the insurer's estimate of water damage to the deck and superstructure of the vessel.  As a result, we do not think that the district court's estimate of Plaintiff's loss, reduced for Plaintiff's own comparative negligence,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> of $54,318.68 can be said to have been made in disregard of the facts.  And certainly, no contention has been made that the award was the product of bias, prejudice or improper influence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, we conclude that a mistake of law compels reduction of the award by $5,000--the amount of the settlement between H &amp; H Propellers and Sullivan.  Under Maine Law, when a person seeks recovery for property damage caused by two or more parties, if a settlement or release is made with one party, \"the trial judge shall reduce the verdict [against the non-settling or non-releasing party or parties] by an amount equal to the settlement with or the consideration for the release of the other [party or parties].\"   Emery Waterhouse Co. v. Lea, 467 A.2d 986, 995 (Me.1983).  The district court neglected to take the settlement with H &amp; H Propellers into account in fixing the verdict.  As a result, the verdict against Vernay must be reduced to $49.318.68.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court's decision is affirmed in part and reversed in part.

We note in passing that, with respect to Vernay's liability under theories of negligence or strict liability, we express no opinion as to the district court's assertion that \"the [Maine] Law Court has not decided th[e] issue\" of the economic loss doctrine's applicability to recoveries under such theories,  Sullivan v. Young Bros. &amp; Co., 893 F.Supp. 1148, 1153 (D.Me.1995), in light of  Oceanside at Pine Point Condo.  Ass'n v. Peachtree Doors, Inc., 659 A.2d 267, 270-71 (Me.1995) (decided two months prior to  Sullivan ) (stating that \"plaintiffs may not recover for [economic] damages in tort\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Vernay also contends that the district court's judgment should be reversed because Sullivan's insurers made payments to Sullivan as \"volunteers\" and were under no contractual obligation to do so, but we think this argument is without merit.  As Vernay itself states in its brief, an insurer is a \"volunteer\" and without rights to subrogation only if it pays its insureds when it clearly has no obligation to do so under its policy.  See, e.g., Allstate Ins. Co. v. Quinn Constr.  Co., 713 F.Supp. 35, 38 (D.Mass.1989) (stating that an insurer \"could be characterized as a volunteer only if it paid [insured] when it clearly had no obligation to do so,\" and any \"doubt ... is construed in favor of the insurer and the nonexistence of a volunteer status\").  The purpose of this rule is \"to encourage insurers to settle promptly claims that appear to be valid.\"   Id. To be sure, Vernay asserts that because Sullivan's policy states that recovery shall be made \"provided such loss or damage has not resulted from want of due diligence by the assured,\" the insurer acted as a volunteer in paying Sullivan despite his negligent conduct.  However, we conclude that the district court did not err in concluding that any consequent argument that the insurer was not necessarily required to pay Sullivan was not sufficiently compelling to meet the legal standard that the insurer clearly had no obligation to pay</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Some courts have apparently extended comparative negligence principles to actions for breach of express warranties.  See, e.g., Haysville U.S.D. No. 261 v. GAF Corp., 233 Kan. 635, 644, 666 P.2d 192, 201 (1983);   Interwest Constr. v. Palmer, 886 P.2d 92, 99-100 (Utah App. 1994);  see also Merritt Logan, Inc. v.

The vessel's owner and operator, Rodney Sullivan (\"Sullivan\"), by his insurer, brought this suit to recover for damages sustained due to the SEA FEVER's sinking.  Sullivan brought suit against Vernay Products, Inc.  (\"Vernay\") and Young Brothers and Company Inc.  (\"Young Brothers\") under theories of strict liability, negligence, and breach of implied and express warranties.  Young Brothers crossclaimed against Vernay for indemnification and contribution, and Vernay similarly crossclaimed against Young Brothers for indemnification and contribution.  The district court found only Vernay to be liable for the damages caused by the SEA FEVER's sinking and awarded damages to Sullivan in the amount of $54,318.68.  On the crossclaim, it entered judgment in favor of Young Brothers.  Before us is Vernay's appeal of the district court's judgment, damage award, and denial of its motion for summary judgment and motions for judgment as a matter of law.  Also before us is Sullivan's cross-appeal of the district court's finding that Young Brothers was not liable.  For the reasons stated below, we affirm, in part, and reverse, in part, the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We take the facts, particularly the more technical aspects, almost verbatim from the district court's detailed opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SEA FEVER is a forty-foot, fiberglass hull lobster boat built by Young Brothers in 1989, which Sullivan purchased new from Young Brothers in February 1990 for $122,000.  Sullivan added various items of gear and furnishings at a cost of approximately $10,000.  Young Brothers built the SEA FEVER with a wet exhaust system, which was composed, in part, of six-inch diameter Vernatube fiberglass marine wet exhaust tubing manufactured by Vernay Products (the \"Vernatube\"), which is a manufacturer of various fiberglass components of marine wet exhaust systems.  H &amp; H Propeller Shop (\"H &amp; H Propeller\" or \"H &amp; H\"),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Vernay's distributor in Maine, was the parts supplier from which Young Brothers purchased the Vernatube installed aboard the SEA FEVER.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SEA FEVER's wet exhaust system was constructed with a fifteen-foot length of Vernatube.  Because Vernatube is sold in ten-foot lengths, Young Brothers fiberglassed together a ten-foot and a five-foot length of Vernatube, making, in effect, a single length of tube.  This span of Vernatube was connected to the engine at the exhaust manifold by a flexible rubber hose and rigidly installed in the hull of the vessel by fiberglass where the Vernatube passed through the fish hold bulkhead, the lazarette bulkhead, and the transom.  Aft of the manifold, it was also fiberglassed to each of the two bulkheads and the transom and the Vernatube exhaust was supported by a 3/4-inch marine plywood bracket lined with urethane rubber at about the midway point of the fish hold.  The district court found that the SEA FEVER's Vernatube wet exhaust system was installed in conformity with generally accepted methods of installation among builders of similar vessels in Maine.  The SEA FEVER was also equipped with a Rule 1500 gallon automatic bilge pump.  This pump, which was capable of discharging up to 1500 gallons of water per hour, could be operated manually or automatically.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan operated the SEA FEVER as a commercial lobster vessel during the 1990 fishing season without significant problems.  In early 1991, Sullivan discovered a crack (the \"1991 crack\") in the portion of the Vernatube exhaust located in the lazarette, which permitted water to enter the vessel to the point of near sinking.  Sullivan discovered the crack because the bilge pump was running more than usual.  At the time, the boat was tied to the dock and fully loaded with 90-100 lobster traps, such that the wet exhaust tubing was completely submerged.  Sullivan notified Young Brothers of this crack, and Young Brothers repaired it by fiberglassing over the break.  Young Brothers also notified H &amp; H Propeller of the crack.  Neither of these companies notified Vernay of this crack, and there was no evidence that Sullivan did.  The cause of this crack was never investigated or discovered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After this repair, the SEA FEVER operated without further problems and Sullivan fished the 1991 season until January 1992.  Thereafter, the SEA FEVER remained at her slip until March 1992, when it was hauled for routine maintenance.  While the SEA FEVER was out of the water, Sullivan did not specifically inspect the exhaust system.  The record shows that the last time he inspected it was at the end of the summer of 1991.  On March 17, 1992, Edward S. Blackmore, a marine surveyor appointed by Sullivan's marine hull insurance company, surveyed the SEA FEVER.  Blackmore found the vessel to be in \"A-1\" condition with a fair market value of $130,000.  Blackmore's inspection included observation of the Vernatube exhaust, which did not have any water in it at the time of the inspection as the SEA FEVER was not loaded.  Nothing unusual was noted about the condition of the Vernatube and Blackmore observed no fractures, no discoloration, and no staining or other evidence of failure in the Vernatube.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the March maintenance and inspection, the SEA FEVER was not operated and remained at her slip until April 4, 1992.  On that day, Sullivan and his sternman made an eight-to-ten-mile trip aboard the SEA FEVER, picking up approximately eighty lobster traps.  After returning, they tied the SEA FEVER to the dock at about 1:00 p.m.  and went home for the day.  Due to the weight of the lobster traps, the end of the exhaust discharge port was several inches under water and, as a result, the Vernatube had water in it.  The SEA FEVER was left with the automatic bilge pump switch in the \"off\" position rather than the \"automatic\" one.  Later that day, at approximately 7:30 p.m., Sullivan was notified that the SEA FEVER had sunk at the dock.  Sullivan retained Wayne Godfrey, a salvage diver from D &amp; G Diving Services, to raise the vessel, which was approximately 90% to 95% submerged.  The SEA FEVER was surveyed by Werner Splettstoesser of Marine Safety Consultants on behalf of Sullivan's insurer, who determined that the SEA FEVER sank due to a crack in the wet exhaust tubing which was visible from the access hatch to the fish hold compartment.  This suit followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 26, 1995, after a four-day bench trial, the district court issued its written decision and order, in which it found that the cause of the SEA FEVER's sinking was a full circumference crack in the Vernatube located a few inches forward of the bulkhead between the lazarette and fish hold (the \"1992 crack\").  The district court further found that this crack was a fatigue failure caused by tension stresses over time exceeding the axial length of the tube.  As there was no other known instance prior to the lawsuit in which a Vernatube had cracked under similar circumstances, much of the trial testimony was directed at the question of whether the 1992 crack had been caused by a defective section of Vernatube or by improper installation of the exhaust system by Young Brothers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After evaluation of expert testimony offered by all three parties, review of the largely technical evidence, and inspection and analysis of the SEA FEVER's Vernatube, the district court found that the ten-foot section of the Vernatube, which developed at least two cracks during a two-year period, was defective.  The district court specifically found that the evidence regarding the Vernatube's porosity, wall thickness, and longitudinal strength \"clearly proves that the section of Vernatube was defective\" and that its defect contributed to the Vernatube's failure in the SEA FEVER.  In particular, the district court found that with respect to these physical measures, the Vernatube did not live up to the specifications described in the Vernay Products Information Sheet (the \"VPIS\").  In making its finding, the district court noted that inspection of the Vernatube revealed several cracks, delamination, and areas of prospective failure, all located in the ten-foot section as well as one area of debonding (i.e., where strands of fiber had come loose).  The district court explicitly ruled out other claimed reasons for the Vernatube's failure, noting that there was no evidence of owner misuse and no indication of Vernatube failures in boats similarly constructed.  Noting that the trial testimony \"clearly established that hundreds of boats of similar design have been constructed with this type of rigid exhaust system without one known failure,\" the district court found that the rigid installation of SEA FEVER's exhaust system was not a cause of the Vernatube's failure and that, therefore, Young Brothers was not strictly liable for its installation of the wet exhaust system.  In making this finding, the district court noted that \"the existence of multiple failures and imperfections within the single ten-foot section of Vernatube, notwithstanding the product's known track record of problem-free similar installations in hundreds of other vessels, supports the conclusion that the SEA FEVER sank because this particular length of tube, rather than its installation, was defective.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the district court held that (i) Vernay's warning against rigid installation, while insufficient, did not give rise to recovery--but Vernay was nonetheless liable under theories of negligence and strict liability based on defects in tubing;  (ii) Sullivan was partially responsible for damage due to his failure to leave his boat's bilge pump in automatic position despite knowing of another crack in the Vernatube exhaust that needed repair;  (iii) Vernay was also liable for breach of express and implied warranties;  (iv) Sullivan's notice to Young Brothers was sufficient to allow recovery for breach of warranty by Vernay;  and (v) Sullivan's recovery would be reduced by 40% to reflect his comparative fault.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court entered an amended judgment on July 28, 1995, based on its earlier decision and order.  The district court had subject matter jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship and satisfaction of the jurisdictional amount.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a).

The basic outline of the flurry of claims is as follows.  Vernay contests the district court's ruling that it was liable under theories of warranty, both express and implied, as well as strict liability for product defects and negligence.  Furthermore, Vernay argues that the district court erred in rejecting the argument that Young Brothers' negligence constitutes a defense to Vernay's liability.  Additionally, Vernay argues that the district court erred in failing to conclude that Sullivan's own conduct should have operated to bar Vernay's liability, rather than occasion a 40% reduction.  Finally, Vernay argues that the district court erred in finding Young Brothers to be without liability under any of Sullivan's theories.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan rejects Vernay's arguments that we should reverse the district court's conclusions with respect to Vernay's liability to him.  Moreover, Sullivan contends that the district court correctly did not bar his recovery due to his own conduct.  Sullivan also argues that the district court erred in finding that Young Brothers was not liable under theories of breach of warranty and strict liability for product defects, although Sullivan contends that the district court correctly concluded that Young Brothers was not liable under a negligence theory.  For its part, Young Brothers argues that the district court correctly decided that it was not liable and that Vernay was.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We address first Vernay's liability, then Young Brothers' liability.  Issues of Sullivan's conduct are discussed as they apply to the other two parties' liability.  Following our liability discussions, we turn to issues of damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Vernay's Liability</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that Vernay breached certain express and implied warranties in the sale of the Vernatube to Young Brothers, all in violation of Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 11, &#167;&#167; 2-313 (express warranty), 2-314 (implied warranty of merchantability), and 2-315 (implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose), and that Vernay was also liable under theories of strict liability for product defects and negligence.  The district court arrived at its conclusions after making extensive findings regarding the Vernatube and the VPIS which were based both on trial testimony, exhibits entered into evidence and the parties' joint stipulations, dated June 1, 1994 (\"Joint Stipulations\").  On appeal, Vernay challenges, for a number of reasons, the district court's conclusions that Vernay is liable for breach of express warranties, breach of implied warranties, and strict liability for product defects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Breach of Express Warranty</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to the Maine Uniform Commercial Code, express warranties by the seller are created by \"[a]ny affirmation of fact or promise made by the seller to the buyer which relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain.\"  Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 11, &#167; 2-313.  Furthermore, \"[i]t is not necessary to the creation of an express warranty that the seller use formal words such as 'warrant' or 'guarantee' or that he have a specific intention to make a warranty, but an affirmation merely of the value of the goods or a statement purporting to be merely the seller's opinion or commendation of the goods does not create a warranty.\"   Id. In general, the question whether certain language creates an express warranty is reserved for the trier of fact.  See Cuthbertson v. Clark Equip.  Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1962506\"><a href=\"/opinion/1962506/cuthbertson-v-clark-equipment-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span></a></span>, 320 (Me.1982).  Below, Sullivan contended that:  the Vernatube had insufficient nominal wall thickness;  the Vernatube was porous on the inner surface, affecting the tube's overall integrity;  and the longitudinal strength was insufficient for the application and could have been increased through changes in the tube's manufacture.  Based on an extensive review of the technical evidence presented, the district court agreed, finding that the deficiency in the nominal wall thickness and the substandard longitudinal strength were not what Vernay expressly warranted in its VPIS, and that the porous nature of the inner surface of the Vernatube contributed to the weakening of the fibers and the fatigue crack which caused the vessel to sink.  The district court ultimately concluded that the \"breach of these express warranties was collectively the cause of the failure of this section of Vernatube.\"   Vernay challenges the district court's conclusion that it breached an express warranty arising from the VPIS on several grounds.  We reject all of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Vernay points out that neither Sullivan nor Young Brothers pled any violation of an express warranty arising from the VPIS.  Sullivan only pled a violation of the express and implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, and Young Brothers only pled a breach of an implied warranty of merchantability.  Accordingly, Vernay argues, the district court erred when it held Vernay breached certain express warranties made in the VPIS.  We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(b),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> we find that the express warranty arising from the VPIS was tried by implied, if not express, consent of the parties and, thus, we \"treat[ ][it] in all respects as if [it] had been raised in the pleadings.\"  Id.;  see Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure:  Civil 2d &#167; 1493 (1990) (\"Rule 15(b) does not require that a conforming amendment be made and there is no penalty for failing to do so.\").  In his pretrial memorandum, Sullivan argues that Vernay Products breached certain express warranties in connection with the sale of the Vernatube, citing to Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 11, &#167; 2-313 and referring to the statements made in the VPIS.  Although in its pretrial memorandum Vernay did point out, albeit somewhat in passing and without reference to any legal rule, that Sullivan had not originally pled breach of an express warranty arising from the VPIS, we find that, because issues relating to both express and implied warranties arising from the VPIS were tried interchangeably and without further objection, the breach of an express warranty arising from the VPIS was tried by implied, if not express, consent under Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(b).  The record shows that Vernay did not object to the presentation of evidence regarding express warranties made in the VPIS, and that Vernay itself introduced considerable testimony regarding its interpretation of the VPIS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, we are unpersuaded by Vernay's counterargument that, because the VPIS was only admitted and discussed for purposes of the strict liability claim's failure to warn issue, its failure to object to the admission of the VPIS or to related testimony cannot be deemed an implied consent to amend the pleadings.  Not only was the evidence and testimony regarding the VPIS related directly to the breach of warranties claims that Sullivan and Young Brothers had pled, but Vernay failed to raise any sort of objection or state for the record that it was not consenting to Sullivan's claim of a breach of an express warranty claim arising from the VPIS.  In addition, Vernay's counsel explicitly admitted to the breach of warranties claims, without reference to the fact that an express warranty arising from the VPIS had not been pled:  In support of defendants' motion for judgment as a matter of law, Vernay's counsel stated that \"[w]ell, we have a breach of contract account here, but I would say there is [an] absolute defense to Vernay under [Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 11, &#167; ] 2-607(3)\" given that Vernay was not given notice of the defect.  (6/21/94 Tr. p. 223).  In any event, even assuming, arguendo, that Vernay had not consented to the amendment of the pleadings, it does not affect the outcome of the appeal as we nonetheless affirm the district court's findings that Vernay breached the express and implied warranties which had originally been pled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Vernay argues that, even if a breach of express warranty is deemed to have been pled, there was no evidence proffered at trial to show that either Young Brothers or Sullivan relied on the representations made in the VPIS.  In support of his argument, Vernay cites  Phillips v. Ripley &amp; Fletcher Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1919568\"><a href=\"/opinion/1919568/phillips-v-ripley-fletcher-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">946</span></a></span>, 950 (Me.1988), and cases from other jurisdictions for the proposition that reliance is an element of a breach of express warranty claim in Maine.  As  Phillips notes, comments to Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 11, &#167; 2-313 suggest that \"the requirement that the affirmation become part of the 'basis of the bargain' is meant to continue the uniform sales act requirement that the purchaser must show reliance on the affirmation in order to make out a cause of action for breach of warranty.\"   Phillips, 541 A.2d at 950 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the district court did not explicitly discuss reliance as an element of the breach of express warranty claim in its memorandum, testimony was given that Young Brothers relied on the VPIS.

Thus, although the district court did not explicitly address reliance, we nonetheless affirm the breach of an express warranty claim based on the record evidence and the failure of Vernay's counsel to object to it, finding that the district court's failure amounts to harmless error in this case, since the failure to make findings of fact and conclusions of law dealt here with an issue on which most relevant facts are undisputed and the law can be applied without the district court's assistance.

Ann. tit. 11, &#167; 2-318 (1995);  see Stanley v. Schiavi Mobile Homes, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2374243\"><a href=\"/opinion/2374243/stanley-v-schiavi-mobile-homes-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1144</span></a></span>, 1147 n. 4 (Me.1983) (noting that lack of privity is no defense in breach of implied warranty actions).  Although there is a lack of privity between Sullivan and Vernay in that Sullivan did not purchase the Vernatube directly from Vernay, Sullivan was certainly a person whom Vernay might reasonably have expected to use, or be affected by, the Vernatube.  Indeed, Vernay itself stipulated to this very fact.  See Joint Stipulations, No. 6. Even without the stipulation, the record supports this finding.  As Vernay points out in its brief, approximately 70-75% of its products are sold directly to boat builders and the rest are sold to wholesale distributors and engine dealerships.  H &amp; H Propeller Shop was Vernay's distributor in Maine and the parts supplier from which Young Brothers purchased the Vernatube installed aboard the SEA FEVER.  As a purchaser of a new vessel from a Maine boat building company which purchased goods from Vernay's Maine distributor, Sullivan was certainly a person whom Vernay might reasonably expect to use, or be affected by, its product.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Notice Requirement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vernay contends that the district court erred in holding it liable under a breach of warranty theory, arguing that it cannot be held responsible for the damages because Sullivan failed to comply with the notice requirements set forth in Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 11, &#167; 2-607(3).  That section requires that, where the tender has been accepted, the buyer must notify the seller of any breach within a reasonable time after he or she discovered or should have discovered any breach or be barred from any remedy.   Id., &#167; 2-607(3).  The \"seller\" is defined as \"a person who sells or contracts to sell goods.\"  Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 11, &#167; 2-103(1)(d).  The district court found that Sullivan satisfied the notice requirement, because he notified Young Brothers, his immediate seller, of the 1991 crack.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal Vernay contends----as it did below----that Sullivan is barred from any remedy because he failed to notify Vernay of the undisputed 1991 crack which caused water to enter the SEA FEVER's holds.  Vernay argues as follows:  If the 1992 crack is considered to be a breach of any warranty then the similar 1991 crack must also be considered a breach and, because it is undisputed that neither Sullivan nor Young Brothers provided Vernay with any notice of the 1991 crack,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Sullivan is barred from any remedy.  For support, Vernay argues that \"the majority of courts\" have held that for claims of economic loss, remote manufacturers must be notified, and that notice to the seller of the product alone is insufficient for purposes of Section 2-607(3).  The consequence of not receiving notice of the first crack, Vernay explains, is that it never had an opportunity to offer a cure.  See Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 11, &#167; 2-605.  The district court rejected Vernay's argument, concluding that the majority of courts in fact have held that buyers need only notify their immediate sellers.   Sullivan, 893 F.Supp. at 1159 (collecting cases).  However, Vernay disputes the cases that the district court cited, and argues that a majority of courts hold the opposite.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, even accepting, arguendo, Vernay's argument, the record supports the conclusion that Vernay had constructive notice and knowledge of the 1991 crack.  As the district court noted when denying defendants' motion for judgment as a matter of law, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff----as the verdict here requires us to--a fact finder could conclude that Vernay was effectively notified via communication to H &amp; H Propeller, Vernay's representative in Maine.  The district court concluded, and we agree, that a fact finder could reasonably infer that the representative had the apparent authority to accept reports for Vernay and that notice given to that agent was effectively constructive knowledge to Vernay, who retained that representative and that company as its exclusive representative in Maine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Vernay raises an additional argument based on the district court's finding that Sullivan was aware of a new crack in 1992 which he \"had been meaning to repair.\"   Vernay now contends that because there is no evidence that Sullivan provided anyone with notice of the 1992 crack prior to the sinking, Sullivan is barred from any remedy.  Vernay further contends that on the facts of this case (namely, that the 1991 crack almost resulted in the sinking of the SEA FEVER and the new crack had the potential to do the same), reasonable notice of this new crack could be nothing less than immediate notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vernay has failed to adduce legal authority for the proposition that, under Maine's version of Article 2 of the UCC, Sullivan's failure to give immediate notice voids his claim.  In contrast, an applicable comment to the UCC states that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p>\"[a] reasonable time\" for notification from a retail consumer is to be judged by different standards [than notice from a merchant buyer], ... for the rule of requiring notification is designed to defeat commercial bad faith, not to deprive a good faith consumer of his remedy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Uniform Commercial Code, &#167; 2-607 cmt. 4.  In this case, where the 1992 crack had given Sullivan no indication of trouble, we must reject Vernay's \"immediate notice\" gloss on what constitutes \"a reasonable time.\"   To adopt Vernay's reading would require consumers to give notice of problems that amount to little more than a nuisance, and would tend to defeat worthy claims with little off-setting benefit to anyone.  Even if consumers were to comply with this burden, manufacturers would be deluged with notices about harmless defects.  In light of the UCC comment's apt caution regarding the notice requirement and retail consumers, we think that it would be unwise to shift the balance in this flow of information in the manner that Vernay urges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result, we uphold the district court's conclusion that Vernay was liable for breach of its express warranties regarding the Vernatube's nominal wall thickness, porosity of its inner surface, and longitudinal strength.  Furthermore, given the expert testimony heard by the district court, its finding of causation cannot be clear error.  See Clement v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"595485\"><a href=\"/opinion/595485/kathleen-barker-clement-individually-and-as-personal-representative-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span>, 53 (1st.

Because we uphold the district court's finding of Vernay's liability based on a breach of its express warranty, we need not consider Vernay's liability with respect to theories of implied warranty, or with respect to negligence or strict liability for product defects.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  See Dudley v.

Vernay contends that Sullivan's own actions were an intervening and superseding cause of his loss.  Because proximate cause is a factual inquiry, the district court's determination must stand unless it is clearly erroneous.  See Clement, 980 F.2d at 53 (\"[c]ausation-in-fact is, by definition a factual inquiry\" under Maine law);   Greenstreet, 623 A.2d at 1271 (\"[p]roximate cause is a question of fact\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled that the breach of the express warranties was collectively the cause of the failure of the Vernatube, which in turn caused the complained-of harm.   Sullivan, 893 F.Supp. at 1159.   Vernay correctly identifies evidence that Sullivan's own actions could have contributed to the SEA FEVER's sinking.  However, the district court also considered expert testimony regarding the Vernatube's physical defects and their role in the SEA FEVER's sinking.  Furthermore, the district court reduced Sullivan's recovery accordingly.  Based on our review of this evidence, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to render the district court's conclusion reasonable.  As a result, we cannot conclude that the district court's finding that Vernay proximately caused the complained-of harm was clearly erroneous.  Accordingly, we affirm the district court's conclusion that Vernay is liable to Sullivan for breach of its express warranty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note in passing that we do not opine on whether Sullivan's recovery under a breach of express warranty theory could appropriately be reduced under comparative negligence principles, since Sullivan does not cross-appeal the reduction.  As the district court properly noted, whether such a reduction is permissible regarding a breach-of-warranty theory is an \"open question under Maine law.\"   Sullivan, 893 F.Supp. at 1161 (citing  Dongo v. Banks, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1962322\"><a href=\"/opinion/1962322/dongo-v-banks/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">885</span></a></span>, 891 (Me.1982) (expressly declining to decide the issue of whether plaintiff's negligence is or should be a defense to an action for breach of implied warranty)).  The district court reduced Sullivan's recovery under both express warranty and implied warranty theories on the basis of trends in case law applying comparative negligence principles to actions for breach of implied warranties.   Id. We neither adopt nor reject the principle that express warranties implicate the same interests as implied warranties with respect to this question.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Rather, we uphold the reduction of Sullivan's award because of his waiver by failing to cross-appeal.  As a result, we caution that our decision to allow a reduction under an express warranty theory for comparative negligence does not stand for an endorsement of comparative negligence's applicability to express warranty theory-based claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Young Brothers' Liability</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vernay argues that the district court erred in finding no liability on the part of Young Brothers on theories of negligence, implied warranty and strict liability.  Sullivan also argues that the district court correctly found no liability on Young Brothers' part under a negligence theory, but that the district court erred in finding Young Brothers not liable for breach of implied warranty.  We address Young Brothers' liability on each of these theories in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Negligence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vernay argues that the district court erred in finding no liability on Young Brothers' part under a negligence theory.  Vernay makes a two-part argument.  First, Vernay argues that Young Brothers was negligent in its design and building of the SEA FEVER.  Second, Vernay contends that Young Brothers was negligent in its conduct after the SEA FEVER had been delivered to Sullivan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to Vernay's first argument, we affirm the district court's conclusion that Young Brothers was not negligent in designing and building the SEA FEVER.  Vernay points out that Young Brothers used a rigid installation of the Vernatube, disregarding written boat building standards, and that the district court heard testimony disapproving of such installation methods.  But the district court also heard testimony of others in the industry to the effect that the installation of Vernatube in the SEA FEVER was typical of customary installation practices in Maine<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>--and custom within the boat building profession is a factor relevant to the standard of care owed by Young Brothers.  See Restatement (Second) of Torts &#167; 295A (1965).  The district court also heard testimony as to the relatively trouble-free operation of Vernatube generally with rigid installation.  While Vernay may wish it otherwise, ours is not the task of crediting witnesses, see Coastal Fuels of Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Caribbean Petroleum Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196628\"><a href=\"/opinion/196628/coastal-fuels-of-pr-v-caribbean-petroleum/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">182</span></a></span>, 195 (1st Cir.1996);   Wytrwal v.

Hooper, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1542549\"><a href=\"/opinion/1542549/the-tj-hooper/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">737</span></a></span>, 740 (2d Cir.)

We dismiss this argument for the same reason that we dismissed Vernay's claim that Vernay is not liable because it was not notified of the 1991 crack.  In fact, Sullivan notified Young Brothers, and Young Brothers in turn notified H &amp; H Propellers, Vernay's Maine distributor and the supplier from whom Young Brothers purchased the Vernatube.  In light of this notice to Vernay's distributor, we cannot accept the contention that Young Brothers was somehow negligent in its handling of the 1991 crack.  Vernay also argues that Young Brothers was negligent in not finding the cause of this crack;  however, one must possess a duty before one can breach it, and as Vernay has not pointed to authority showing that Young Brothers owed a duty beyond notifying its supplier, we reject this contention.  As a result, we conclude that Young Brothers cannot be held liable under a negligence theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Implied Warranty and Strict Liability</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vernay argues that the district court erred in finding Vernay liable and Young Brothers not liable under theories of implied warranty and strict liability.  Vernay argues that the district court erred by concluding that Vernay was liable under a theory of implied warranty, while Young Brothers did not breach its implied warranty that the vessel would be fit for its ordinary use.  Additionally, according to Vernay, both of these parties participated in the sale of the allegedly defective Vernatube, and therefore, it is impossible for Vernay to be held strictly liable and Young Brothers not to be held strictly liable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court correctly concluded that Young Brothers could not be found liable for breach of an implied warranty of merchantability.  Maine's version of Article 2 of the UCC provides that \"a warranty that the goods shall be merchantable is implied in a contract for their sale if the seller is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind.\"  Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 11, &#167; 2-314(1) (emphasis added).  In  Suminski v. Maine Appliance Warehouse, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2104774\"><a href=\"/opinion/2104774/suminski-v-maine-appliance-warehouse/\"><span class=\"volume\">602</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1173</span></a></span> (Me.1992), the Maine Law Court interpreted the phrase \"goods of that kind.\"   Id. at 1175 (discussing section 2-314(1)).  The Law Court concluded that a defective switch that did not affect use of a television for more than a year did not render a seller of televisions liable for breach of an implied warranty.  In particular, the Law Court stated that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p>the sale of a major appliance with a switch that fails more than a year later cannot support a finding that the entire appliance was unmerchantable when sold.  To use an automotive example, an unmerchantable battery may not render an entire vehicle unmerchantable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Suminski, 602 A.2d at 1175.   We conclude, similarly, that in the instant case, where the Vernatube did not impede use of the SEA FEVER for more than one year, and Young Brothers sells boats, not Vernatube, Young Brothers cannot be held liable for breach of an implied warranty of fitness for ordinary purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, we cannot agree with the district court's conclusion that Young Brothers was not strictly liable to Sullivan.  Maine's strict liability statute provides that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p>[o]ne who sells any goods or products in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer or his property is subject to liability for physical harm thereby caused to a person whom the manufacturer, seller or supplier might reasonably have expected to use, consume or be affected by the goods, or to his property....  This section applies although the seller has exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of his product and the user or consumer has not bought the product from or entered into any contractual relation with the seller.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &#167; 221.  The district court concluded that Young Brothers was not strictly liable because \"the rigid installation of SEA FEVER's exhaust system was not a cause of the failure in the Vernatube.\"   Sullivan, 893 F.Supp. at 1155.   This conclusion cannot be reconciled with the statute's explicit direction that a seller's liability attaches notwithstanding the seller's exercise of \"all possible care.\"   If the Vernatube section was \"defective\" and \"unreasonably dangerous,\" as the district court suggests in its opinion, it would be immaterial that Young Brothers' own actions did not cause Sullivan's injuries.  As a result, we must vacate the district court's judgment that Young Brothers was not liable to Sullivan under a strict liability theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Young Brothers' sole apparent argument to rebut the conclusion that it is strictly liable to Sullivan is that, based on  Suminski, Young Brothers' should be considered a seller of boats, not the Vernatube in the boats.  As discussed above,  Suminski applies on its face to allegations that an implied warranty of merchantability has been violated, not to theories of strict liability.   Suminski, 602 A.2d at 1175.   We decline to so greatly extend  Suminski 's reach, and as a result we must grant judgment to Sullivan against Young Brothers under a theory of strict liability.  As the parties have neither briefed nor argued Maine indemnification law among tortfeasors, we remand to the district court for further proceedings regarding Young Brothers' rights to indemnity from Sullivan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Damages</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vernay also challenges the district court's computation of Sullivan's damages. In particular, Vernay takes issue with the district court's choice of the cost of repair rather than diminution in the value of the damaged property.  Under Maine law, both measures may be used to prove the amount of damages.  See Paine v. Spottiswoode, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2062153\"><a href=\"/opinion/2062153/paine-v-spottiswoode/\"><span class=\"volume\">612</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">235</span></a></span>, 240 (Me.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Generally, we will not substitute our judgment for that of the [factfinder] in assessing damages and will not disturb the [factfinder's] damage award unless that award is a product of bias, prejudice, improper influence, or was reached under a mistake of law or in disregard of the facts.\"   Bradford v. Dumond, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2106807\"><a href=\"/opinion/2106807/bradford-v-dumond/\"><span class=\"volume\">675</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">957</span></a></span>, 962 (Me.1996);   Currier v.

The district court \"is entitled to act upon probable and inferential as well as direct and positive proof in determining damages.\"   Bradford, 675 A.2d at 962;   Cyr, 570 A.2d at 1210.   In the present case, we think that the district court was justified in relying on the undisputed costs of Plaintiff's initial loss investigation, the cost of a salvor to raise the SEA FEVER, Plaintiff's repair costs for the vessel's machinery, and the insurer's estimate of water damage to the deck and superstructure of the vessel.  As a result, we do not think that the district court's estimate of Plaintiff's loss, reduced for Plaintiff's own comparative negligence,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> of $54,318.68 can be said to have been made in disregard of the facts.  And certainly, no contention has been made that the award was the product of bias, prejudice or improper influence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, we conclude that a mistake of law compels reduction of the award by $5,000--the amount of the settlement between H &amp; H Propellers and Sullivan.  Under Maine Law, when a person seeks recovery for property damage caused by two or more parties, if a settlement or release is made with one party, \"the trial judge shall reduce the verdict [against the non-settling or non-releasing party or parties] by an amount equal to the settlement with or the consideration for the release of the other [party or parties].\"   Emery Waterhouse Co. v. Lea, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1467547\"><a href=\"/opinion/1467547/emery-waterhouse-co-v-lea/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">986</span></a></span>, 995 (Me.1983).  The district court neglected to take the settlement with H &amp; H Propellers into account in fixing the verdict.  As a result, the verdict against Vernay must be reduced to $49.318.68.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court's decision is affirmed in part and reversed in part.

We note in passing that, with respect to Vernay's liability under theories of negligence or strict liability, we express no opinion as to the district court's assertion that \"the [Maine] Law Court has not decided th[e] issue\" of the economic loss doctrine's applicability to recoveries under such theories,  Sullivan v.

As Vernay itself states in its brief, an insurer is a \"volunteer\" and without rights to subrogation only if it pays its insureds when it clearly has no obligation to do so under its policy.  See, e.g., Allstate Ins. Co. v. Quinn Constr.  Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">713</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></span>, 38 (D.Mass.1989) (stating that an insurer \"could be characterized as a volunteer only if it paid [insured] when it clearly had no obligation to do so,\" and any \"doubt ... is construed in favor of the insurer and the nonexistence of a volunteer status\").  The purpose of this rule is \"to encourage insurers to settle promptly claims that appear to be valid.\"   Id. To be sure, Vernay asserts that because Sullivan's policy states that recovery shall be made \"provided such loss or damage has not resulted from want of due diligence by the assured,\" the insurer acted as a volunteer in paying Sullivan despite his negligent conduct.  However, we conclude that the district court did not err in concluding that any consequent argument that the insurer was not necessarily required to pay Sullivan was not sufficiently compelling to meet the legal standard that the insurer clearly had no obligation to pay</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Some courts have apparently extended comparative negligence principles to actions for breach of express warranties.
