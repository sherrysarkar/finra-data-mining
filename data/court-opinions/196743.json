William Degnan, Jr., the former\r                    SELYA, Circuit Judge.\r                                        \r\n\npresident of Fenwal Electronics,  Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary\r\n\nof Publicker  Industries, Inc., initiated  this misrepresentation\r\n\naction  in  a  Massachusetts   state  court  against  Fenwal  and\r\n\nPublicker  on  November  14,  1994.    He  framed  his  complaint\r\n\nexclusively in terms of state law, alleging in substance that the\r\n\ndefendants induced him to take early retirement at age fifty-five\r\n\nby promising to revise a corporate  retirement plan so as to make\r\n\nhim  eligible for full retirement benefits at that age; and that,\r\n\nafter he retired  (giving up  lucrative employment  opportunities\r\n\nelsewhere), the  defendants paid him  the agreed amount  for only\r\n\neighteen months before they breached their promise (claiming that\r\n\nhe did not  qualify for  full benefits under  the amended  plan).\r\n\nThe defendants removed the case to the federal district court and\r\n\nsought dismissal on preemption grounds.\r\n\n          On September 8, 1995, the district court found that the\r\n\nEmployee  Retirement  Income Security  Act  of  1974 (ERISA),  29\r\n\nU.S.C.    1001 et seq.,  and in particular,  ERISA's broad-gauged\r                                \r\n\npreemption clause, 29 U.S.C.   1144(a) (1994), preempted Degnan's\r\n\ncommon law misrepresentation claims against the defendants.  Upon\r\n\nreviewing the  matter de novo, see  Correa-Martinez v. Arrillaga-\r                                                                           \r\n\nBelendez, 903 F.2d  49, 52  (1st Cir.  1990), we  agree that  the\r                  \r\n\ncommon law claims were preempted and that the complaint as framed\r\n\ncourted  dismissal.   See Fed.  R. Civ. P.  12(b)(6) (authorizing\r                                   \r\n\ndismissal  for  the  pleader's  failure to  state  an  actionable\r\n\nclaim).\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\n          We  need  not  dwell  upon the  rationale  for  finding\r\n\npreemption.   Suffice it to say that,  in its order of dismissal,\r\n\nthe district court characterized  the instant case as \"analogous\"\r\n\nin all material  respects to  a case previously  decided by  this\r\n\ncourt, namely, Carlo v. Reed Rolled  Thread Die Co., 49 F.3d 790,\r                                                             \r\n\n793-95 (1st Cir. 1995)  (ruling that ERISA preempted a  state-law\r\n\nmisrepresentation claim).   We readily agree  that Carlo controls\r                                                                  \r\n\nhere, and add only that in his appellate briefs Degnan has failed\r\n\nto advance any plausible basis  for distinguishing this case from\r\n\nCarlo.\r               \r\n\n          Under ordinary circumstances, this  would be the end of\r\n\nthe matter.  Where, as here, the plaintiff chooses not to ask the\r\n\ntrial court for permission to amend but stands upon his complaint\r\n\nin the face of an  order dismissing it, and thereafter loses  the\r\n\nensuing  appeal, he  is  not entitled  to  a second  bite  of the\r\n\nbanana.   See, e.g., Royal Business Group, Inc. v. Realist, Inc.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n933 F.2d 1056, 1066 (1st Cir. 1991) (explaining that when a party\r\n\nelects to appeal rather than attempt to amend a complaint, it ill\r\n\nbehooves that party to suggest at a later date that it could have\r\n\nsatisfied   the  district   court's  concerns  by   amending  the\r\n\ncomplaint);  James v.  Watt,  716 F.2d  71,  78 (1st  Cir.  1983)\r                                     \r\n\n(admonishing that courts should not routinely allow plaintiffs to\r\n\n\"pursue a  case to judgment and then, if they lose, to reopen the\r\n\ncase by amending their  complaint to take account of  the court's\r\n\ndecision\"), cert. denied, 467 U.S. 1209 (1984).\r                                  \r\n\n          The  rule,  however,  is   not  inflexible.    We  have\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nrecognized that, even if  the pleader has  elected to dig in  his\r\n\nheels,  appealing  from  a  judgment  of  dismissal  rather  than\r\n\nendeavoring to reframe his complaint, \"an appellate court has the\r\n\npower, in the interest of justice, to grant leave to amend if the\r\n\ncircumstances warrant.\"  Rivera-Gomez v. de Castro, 843 F.2d 631,\r                                                            \r\n\n636 (1st Cir. 1988).  This approach finds ample  support in other\r\n\nappellate authority, see,  e.g., Bryan v.  Austin, 354 U.S.  933,\r                                                           \r\n\n933 (1957) (per  curiam); Whitelock v.

Moore, Moore's Federal Practice\r                                                                           \r\n\n  15.11  at 15-109 (1983),  in the Code,  see, e.g., 28  U.S.C.  \r                                                             \r\n\n2106  (1994)  (\"[A] court  of appellate  jurisdiction  may .  . .\r\n\ndirect  the entry of  such appropriate judgment  . . .  as may be\r\n\njust under  the circumstances.\"), and in the spirit that pervades\r\n\nthe Civil Rules,  see, e.g.,  Fed. R. Civ.  P. 15(a)  (counseling\r                                     \r\n\nthat  leave to  amend  \"shall be  freely  given when  justice  so\r\n\nrequires\").\r\n\n          This is  a suitable  instance  in which  to invoke  the\r\n\nexception  to  the general  rule.   The  appeal  is  in a  highly\r\n\nidiosyncratic  posture.  On March 19, 1996, after the parties had\r\n\nbriefed  this  appeal but  two  weeks before  oral  argument, the\r\n\nSupreme Court issued its opinion in Varity Corp. v. Howe, 116  S.\r                                                                  \r\n\nCt. 1065 (1996).   Varity shed new light  on the Court's  earlier\r                                   \r\n\nholding  in Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\n134  (1985), and  indicated  that, in  certain circumstances,  an\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nindividual plan participant or beneficiary may be able to  obtain\r\n\nequitable relief under  the ERISA statute itself  for harm caused\r                                                          \r\n\nby an  employer's  breach  of  its fiduciary  obligations.    See\r                                                                           \r\n\nVarity, 116  S. Ct.  at 1075-79;  see  also 29  U.S.C.    1132(a)\r                                                     \r\n\n(1994) (enumerating equitable remedies  under ERISA).  Because we\r\n\ndeemed Varity to have possible applicability here, we immediately\r                       \r\n\ncalled the opinion to the parties' attention and directed them to\r\n\nbe prepared  to discuss it.   We heard oral argument  on April 2,\r\n\n1996.   We then ordered  the parties to  file supplemental briefs\r\n\naddressing  the potential  applicability  (if any)  of Varity  to\r                                                                       \r\n\nDegnan's situation.1\r\n\n          We  have examined the record  in this case  in light of\r\n\nVarity  and of  the parties'  supplemental briefs.   We  see both\r                \r\n\nprocedural  and  substantive  problems.   The  procedural problem\r\n\nstems from the  fact that Degnan framed his suit  as a common law\r\n\ncause of action for misrepresentation rather  than as a statutory\r\n\nERISA-based claim for breach  of a fiduciary duty.   The district\r\n\ncourt  treated  the  claim  as  asserted  and,  under  our  Carlo\r                                                                           \r\n\nprecedent, correctly  found the  pleaded  cause of  action to  be\r\n\npreempted.  The plaintiff neither asked the court to consider the\r\n\npossibility of a statutorily based claim nor sought leave to file\r\n\nan amended complaint.   As we have said, these failings  would be\r\n\nfatal in the typical case.  See, e.g., Royal Business Group,  933\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.2d at 1066.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Simultaneous with the filing of his supplemental brief, the\r\nappellant also moved to enlarge the record on appeal.  In view of\r\nour disposition today, the motion is moot.\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\n          This case, however, is  atypical.  When Degnan eschewed\r\n\namendment  in the district court, Varity had not yet been decided\r                                                  \r\n\nand the state of the law was in flux.  We think it is appropriate\r\n\nfor  an  appellate   court  to  consider  granting  the  type  of\r\n\nextraordinary  relief   that  the  plaintiff   requests  here    \r\n\npermitting an  amendment even  after affirmance  of  an order  of\r\n\ndismissal     when an  important  new decision  intervenes.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nDartmouth  Review v. Dartmouth College, 889 F.2d 13, 23 (1st Cir.\r                                                \r\n\n1989) (suggesting  that such  an amendment  should be  allowed if\r\n\n\"some  new  concept  has  surfaced,  making  workable  an  action\r\n\npreviously  in the doldrums\"); Pross  v. Katz, 784  F.2d 455, 460\r                                                       \r\n\n(2d  Cir.  1986) (similar).    That  scenario, broadly  speaking,\r\n\nappears to exist here.\r\n\n          We  find  added  impetus  for  applying  the  exception\r\n\nbecause of the  nature of the case.  ERISA  is a remedial statute\r\n\ndesigned to fashion anodynes  that protect the interests  of plan\r\n\nparticipants  and  beneficiaries.     See  29  U.S.C.     1001(b)\r                                                   \r\n\n(articulating  policy  \"to  protect  .   .  .  the  interests  of\r\n\nparticipants in employee benefit  plans and their beneficiaries .\r\n\n. . by  providing for appropriate remedies,  sanctions, and ready\r\n\naccess to the  Federal courts\"); see also  Varity, 116 S.  Ct. at\r                                                           \r\n\n1078; Johnson v.  Watts Regulator  Co., 63 F.3d  1129, 1132  (1st\r                                                \r\n\nCir. 1995).  Courts  should not hasten to employ  technical rules\r\n\nof  pleading and practice to defeat that  goal.  In this respect,\r\n\nFitzgerald  v.  Codex Corp.,  882 F.2d  586  (1st Cir.  1989), is\r                                     \r\n\ninstructive.   There the  state law remedies  that the  plaintiff\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nsought were held  to have been entirely displaced  by ERISA.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nid. at  588.  Although the plaintiff had not attempted to state a\r             \r\n\nfederal claim in the district court, we nonetheless  proceeded to\r\n\ninquire  whether his complaint could be read to contain a federal\r\n\nclaim  upon which  relief  might be  granted.   See  id. at  589.\r                                                                  \r\n\nAnswering that question in the affirmative, we reversed the order\r\n\nof dismissal.  See id.\r                                \r\n\n          The  short of it is  that in Fitzgerald,  as in Rivera-\r                                                                           \r\n\nGomez, we departed from our usual praxis to avoid injustice.   We\r               \r\n\nbelieve that, given the purport and timing of the Court's opinion\r\n\nin  Varity, the same result  should obtain here.   The procedural\r                    \r\n\nbarrier to permitting an amendment is, therefore, superable.\r\n\n          The substantive problem is whether or not the plaintiff\r\n\ncan  state a claim  under Varity.2   At this  juncture, we simply\r                                          \r\n\ncannot tell.  Because the plaintiff  has not yet tried to plead a\r\n\nVarity claim, we  do not know  how well the  shoe fits, or if  it\r                \r\n\nfits at  all.  Rather  than guessing at what  facts the plaintiff\r\n\nconceivably could allege  in an amended complaint,  we think that\r\n\nthe course of prudence is to give the plaintiff an opportunity to\r\n\nsupplement  his  factual  allegations  with  whatever  additional\r\n\naverments  he believes  would buttress  Varity-type  claims, and,\r                                                        \r\n\nonce  an amended complaint is filed, to permit the district court\r\n\nto address the substantive problem, i.e., the  sufficiency of the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2We  note  that  the  substantive  and  procedural  problems\r\ninterlock because leave to  file an amended complaint  should not\r\nbe granted  if it is clear  that the amendment would  be in vain.\r\nSee  Foman v. Davis,  371 U.S. 178,  182 (1962); Correa-Martinez,\r                                                                          \r\n903 F.2d at 59.\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\namended complaint, in the first instance.\r\n\n          We  need go no further.   We remand  with directions to\r\n\ngrant  the  plaintiff permission  to  file  an amended  complaint\r\n\nlimited  to whatever  Varity-type  claims he  may envision  under\r                                      \r\n\nERISA.  From that  point forward, the district court  can proceed\r\n\nin the ordinary course.  For our part, we take no view of whether\r\n\nthe plaintiff's case fits the Varity mold from the perspective of\r                                              \r\n\neither pleadings or proof.\r\n\n          We affirm the dismissal of the complaint insofar as  it\r                    We affirm the dismissal of the complaint insofar as  it\r                                                                           \r\n\npurports to state claims based on the common law or on state law,\r          purports to state claims based on the common law or on state law,\r                                                                           \r\n\nand we  remand the  case to the  district court  with an  express\r          and we  remand the  case to the  district court  with an  express\r                                                                           \r\n\ndirection  that  it permit  the  plaintiff  to  file  an  amended\r          direction  that  it permit  the  plaintiff  to  file  an  amended\r                                                                           \r\n\ncomplaint limited to his claim(s) under ERISA.

He  framed  his  complaint\r\n\nexclusively in terms of state law, alleging in substance that the\r\n\ndefendants induced him to take early retirement at age fifty-five\r\n\nby promising to revise a corporate  retirement plan so as to make\r\n\nhim  eligible for full retirement benefits at that age; and that,\r\n\nafter he retired  (giving up  lucrative employment  opportunities\r\n\nelsewhere), the  defendants paid him  the agreed amount  for only\r\n\neighteen months before they breached their promise (claiming that\r\n\nhe did not  qualify for  full benefits under  the amended  plan).\r\n\nThe defendants removed the case to the federal district court and\r\n\nsought dismissal on preemption grounds.\r\n\n          On September 8, 1995, the district court found that the\r\n\nEmployee  Retirement  Income Security  Act  of  1974 (ERISA),  29\r\n\nU.S.C.    1001 et seq.,  and in particular,  ERISA's broad-gauged\r                                \r\n\npreemption clause, 29 U.S.C.   1144(a) (1994), preempted Degnan's\r\n\ncommon law misrepresentation claims against the defendants.  Upon\r\n\nreviewing the  matter de novo, see  Correa-Martinez v. Arrillaga-\r                                                                           \r\n\nBelendez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541732\"><a href=\"/opinion/541732/jorge-correa-martinez-v-rene-arrillaga-belendez/\"><span class=\"volume\">903</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 52  (1st Cir.  1990), we  agree that  the\r                  \r\n\ncommon law claims were preempted and that the complaint as framed\r\n\ncourted  dismissal.

Suffice it to say that,  in its order of dismissal,\r\n\nthe district court characterized  the instant case as \"analogous\"\r\n\nin all material  respects to  a case previously  decided by  this\r\n\ncourt, namely, Carlo v.

Where, as here, the plaintiff chooses not to ask the\r\n\ntrial court for permission to amend but stands upon his complaint\r\n\nin the face of an  order dismissing it, and thereafter loses  the\r\n\nensuing  appeal, he  is  not entitled  to  a second  bite  of the\r\n\nbanana.

Because we\r\n\ndeemed Varity to have possible applicability here, we immediately\r                       \r\n\ncalled the opinion to the parties' attention and directed them to\r\n\nbe prepared  to discuss it.   We heard oral argument  on April 2,\r\n\n1996.   We then ordered  the parties to  file supplemental briefs\r\n\naddressing  the potential  applicability  (if any)  of Varity  to\r                                                                       \r\n\nDegnan's situation.1\r\n\n          We  have examined the record  in this case  in light of\r\n\nVarity  and of  the parties'  supplemental briefs.   We  see both\r                \r\n\nprocedural  and  substantive  problems.   The  procedural problem\r\n\nstems from the  fact that Degnan framed his suit  as a common law\r\n\ncause of action for misrepresentation rather  than as a statutory\r\n\nERISA-based claim for breach  of a fiduciary duty.   The district\r\n\ncourt  treated  the  claim  as  asserted  and,  under  our  Carlo\r                                                                           \r\n\nprecedent, correctly  found the  pleaded  cause of  action to  be\r\n\npreempted.  The plaintiff neither asked the court to consider the\r\n\npossibility of a statutorily based claim nor sought leave to file\r\n\nan amended complaint.   As we have said, these failings  would be\r\n\nfatal in the typical case.  See, e.g., Royal Business Group,  933\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.2d at 1066.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Simultaneous with the filing of his supplemental brief, the\r\nappellant also moved to enlarge the record on appeal.  In view of\r\nour disposition today, the motion is moot.\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\n          This case, however, is  atypical.  When Degnan eschewed\r\n\namendment  in the district court, Varity had not yet been decided\r                                                  \r\n\nand the state of the law was in flux.  We think it is appropriate\r\n\nfor  an  appellate   court  to  consider  granting  the  type  of\r\n\nextraordinary  relief   that  the  plaintiff   requests  here    \r\n\npermitting an  amendment even  after affirmance  of  an order  of\r\n\ndismissal     when an  important  new decision  intervenes.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nDartmouth  Review v.

That  scenario, broadly  speaking,\r\n\nappears to exist here.\r\n\n          We  find  added  impetus  for  applying  the  exception\r\n\nbecause of the  nature of the case.  ERISA  is a remedial statute\r\n\ndesigned to fashion anodynes  that protect the interests  of plan\r\n\nparticipants  and  beneficiaries.     See  29  U.S.C.     1001(b)\r                                                   \r\n\n(articulating  policy  \"to  protect  .   .  .  the  interests  of\r\n\nparticipants in employee benefit  plans and their beneficiaries .\r\n\n. . by  providing for appropriate remedies,  sanctions, and ready\r\n\naccess to the  Federal courts\"); see also  Varity, 116 S.

There the  state law remedies  that the  plaintiff\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nsought were held  to have been entirely displaced  by ERISA.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nid. at  588.  Although the plaintiff had not attempted to state a\r             \r\n\nfederal claim in the district court, we nonetheless  proceeded to\r\n\ninquire  whether his complaint could be read to contain a federal\r\n\nclaim  upon which  relief  might be  granted.   See  id. at  589.\r                                                                  \r\n\nAnswering that question in the affirmative, we reversed the order\r\n\nof dismissal.  See id.\r                                \r\n\n          The  short of it is  that in Fitzgerald,  as in Rivera-\r                                                                           \r\n\nGomez, we departed from our usual praxis to avoid injustice.   We\r               \r\n\nbelieve that, given the purport and timing of the Court's opinion\r\n\nin  Varity, the same result  should obtain here.   The procedural\r                    \r\n\nbarrier to permitting an amendment is, therefore, superable.\r\n\n          The substantive problem is whether or not the plaintiff\r\n\ncan  state a claim  under Varity.2   At this  juncture, we simply\r                                          \r\n\ncannot tell.  Because the plaintiff  has not yet tried to plead a\r\n\nVarity claim, we  do not know  how well the  shoe fits, or if  it\r                \r\n\nfits at  all.  Rather  than guessing at what  facts the plaintiff\r\n\nconceivably could allege  in an amended complaint,  we think that\r\n\nthe course of prudence is to give the plaintiff an opportunity to\r\n\nsupplement  his  factual  allegations  with  whatever  additional\r\n\naverments  he believes  would buttress  Varity-type  claims, and,\r                                                        \r\n\nonce  an amended complaint is filed, to permit the district court\r\n\nto address the substantive problem, i.e., the  sufficiency of the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2We  note  that  the  substantive  and  procedural  problems\r\ninterlock because leave to  file an amended complaint  should not\r\nbe granted  if it is clear  that the amendment would  be in vain.\r\nSee  Foman v.
