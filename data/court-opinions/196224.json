Before  us  is  a  motion to  restore  a\r                             \r\n\npreliminary injunction pending appeal.  For almost six years,\r\n\nappellant Gerber Radio Supply Co. (Gerber),  a Massachusetts-\r\n\nbased  distributor  of  electronic  components,  was  a  non-\r\n\nexclusive distributor  in the  northeast  region for  Philips\r\n\nSemiconductors,    Inc.    (Philips),    a   California-based\r\n\nmanufacturer  of integrated circuits.  In March 1995, Philips\r\n\nexercised   its   contractual   option   to   terminate   the\r\n\ndistributorship agreement, effective the following month.  It\r\n\nthereafter sent  to  most  or  all  of  its  remaining  local\r\n\ndistributors  a computerized  printout  identifying some  520\r\n\ncustomers that  had bought  Philips products  from Gerber  in\r\n\n1994,  along  with  their  respective  volume  of  purchases.\r\n\nGerber proceeded to file suit against Philips and  various of\r\n\nthe distributors in Massachusetts state court, claiming inter\r                                                                         \r\n\nalia that the disclosure of  its customer list (1) breached a\r                \r\n\nconfidentiality obligation  contained in  the distributorship\r\n\nagreement and (2) was a misappropriation of trade secrets. \r\n\n     A superior court  justice denied Gerber's request  for a\r\n\npreliminary injunction, finding no  likelihood of success  on\r\n\nthe merits.  A single  justice of the appeals court, however,\r\n\nagreed to enter  a narrow injunction requiring  defendants to\r\n\nreturn all  copies of the  customer list and  precluding them\r\n\nfrom  disclosing  the  contents  thereof  to  third  parties.\r\r\n\nGerber's further  request to  bar defendants  from soliciting\r\n\nthe listed customers was denied.  \r\n\n     Shortly thereafter,  the  case was  removed  to  federal\r\n\ncourt.    In  response  to  Gerber's  motion  to  extend  the\r\n\npreliminary injunction  to several defendants  recently added\r\n\nto the case,  Philips moved for its dissolution, arguing that\r\n\nit  was defective on both substantive and procedural grounds.\r\n\nGerber replied  that the  district court  was constrained  to\r\n\nadhere  to  the single  justice's  ruling, but  that,  if any\r\n\nmodification  were to be undertaken, the injunction should be\r\n\nextended  to preclude  solicitation of  its  customers.   The\r\n\ndistrict court agreed to dissolve the injunction on the basis\r\n\nthat irreparable harm  had not been established.   Gerber has\r\n\nappealed from  this order, and  now asks that we  restore the\r\n\npreliminary injunction  issued by the single  justice pending\r\n\nsuch appeal.   For the following reasons, we  deny the motion\r\n\nto  restore and  summarily affirm  the order of  the district\r\n\ncourt.\r\n\n     Gerber  acknowledges that a district court is authorized\r\n\nunder 28 U.S.C.    1450 to  modify or dissolve a  state court\r\n\ninjunction following removal.  See, e.g., Hyde Park Partners,\r                                                                         \r\n\nL.P. v. Connolly,  839 F.2d  837, 842  (1st Cir.  1988).   It\r                            \r\n\ncontends, however, that this power does not extend to a state\r\n\nappellate  court  order.   In  its view,  such  an injunction\r\n\nbecomes \"federalized\" once the case is removed and is thereby\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nconverted into a federal appellate court order binding on the\r                                              \r\n\ndistrict  court.  We note that such  a view diverges from the\r\n\napproach  adopted in  recent  removal  cases  arising  in  an\r\n\nanalogous context.  See, e.g.,  RTC v. Bayside Developers, 43\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d 1230,  1238 (9th  Cir. 1994); LeMaire  v. FDIC,  20 F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\n654, 655 &amp; n.3 (5th Cir. 1994),  cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 723\r                                                         \r\n\n(1995); In re 5300 Memorial  Investors, Ltd., 973 F.2d  1160,\r                                                        \r\n\n1162-63  (5th Cir.  1992).    Yet we  need  not resolve  this\r\n\nquestion since Gerber's argument fails for a separate reason.\r\n\n     It  is   undisputed  that  federal   rather  than  state\r\n\nprocedural   requirements   govern  the   future   course  of\r\n\nproceedings  in a  removed  case.   See,  e.g., Granny  Goose\r                                                                         \r\n\nFoods,  Inc. v. Brotherhood of Teamsters,  Local 70, 415 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\n423, 437  &amp; n.10 (1974);  FDIC v. Bay  Street Dev. Corp.,  32\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.3d 636, 639 (1st Cir. 1994).   Here, there is no indication\r\n\nthat  the  single  justice,  in  granting  equitable  relief,\r\n\nrequired the posting of a bond or at least considered whether\r\n\na bond was  necessary--as mandated by Fed. R.  Civ. P. 65(c).\r\n\nSee, e.g., In re Kingsley, 802 F.2d 571, 578 (1st Cir. 1986).\r                                     \r\n\nGiven  this   omission,  and  considering  that   the  single\r\n\njustice's ruling was provisional in nature and lacked written\r\n\nfindings,  we  think  the  district  court  was  entitled  to\r\n\nundertake a review of the state court injunction.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n     We  likewise  conclude  that   the  district  court  was\r\n\nwarranted in dissolving the injunction.  In so concluding, we\r\n\nexpress  no  view as  to  the merits  of  Gerber's underlying\r\n\naction.  Instead, we rely on three considerations.  First, we\r\n\nare  inclined to  agree  that irreparable  harm has  not been\r\n\ndemonstrated  under  the  circumstances.    Gerber  does  not\r\n\nsuggest that  its economic  viability is  threatened; indeed,\r\n\nsales of  Philips products accounted for only seven to eleven\r\n\npercent  of  its  business  in  recent years.    Instead,  it\r\n\ncontends  that  it  faces  the  potential  loss  of  all  520\r\n\ncustomers  identified   on  the  list   (said  to   represent\r\n\napproximately  twenty-five  percent  of  its customer  base).\r\n\nYet, having advanced  no challenge to the  termination of its\r\n\nPhilips  distributorship,  Gerber  cannot  complain  of   the\r\n\ninevitable  loss of  those customers  who  retain loyalty  to\r\n\nPhilips products.  The extent  to which such customers  might\r\n\nalso take their non-Philips business elsewhere is speculative\r\n\nat  this   point,  but  presumably   subject  to   reasonable\r\n\nquantification in the future.  Most important, Gerber goes on\r\n\nto explain that it is concerned only with those customers who\r\n\npreviously bought Philips products  exclusively from Gerber.1\r                                                           \r\n\nAnd the number  of such customers--although not  specified in\r\n\nthe record--appears  relatively small.   Gerber  acknowledges\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Gerber has  not requested that the defendant distributors\r\nbe enjoined from contacting those  customers on the list with\r\nwhom they were already doing business.\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nthat  approximately two-thirds  of  its  customers were  also\r\n\nthose of  another distributor  (defendant Wyle  Electronics).\r\n\nNor  has  it disputed  that  other distributors,  as  well as\r\n\nPhilips  itself,  have   also  dealt  with  various   of  its\r\n\ncustomers.   These considerations, we think, militate against\r\n\nany finding of irreparable harm.\r\n\n     Second, restoration of the  narrow injunction imposed by\r\n\nthe single  justice would  accomplish little  at this  point.\r\n\nDefendants have now been  in possession of the  customer list\r\n\nfor nearly five  months.  Indeed, partly because  of Gerber's\r\n\nfailure to seek an appropriate protective order, the list has\r\n\nbeen  publicly available for most of that period--having been\r\n\nsubmitted (in unsealed format) as  part of the record in this\r\n\ncase.  Under  these circumstances, we fail to  see how Gerber\r\n\nwould  benefit from any  renewed order barring  disclosure of\r\n\nthe customer list to third parties.  Cf. CMM Cable Rep., Inc.\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Ocean Coast Properties., Inc.,  48 F.3d 618, 621 (1st Cir.\r                                            \r\n\n1995) (noting  that an appeal from the denial of a motion for\r\n\npreliminary  injunction is moot if the appellate court can no\r\n\nlonger preserve, or feasibly restore, the status quo).\r\n\n     Finally, the district court's decision not to extend the\r\n\ninjunction to bar the solicitation of customers is one we are\r\n\nnot prepared  to disturb.   As just mentioned, the  number of\r\n\ncustomers  to  whom   such  an  injunction  would   apply  is\r\n\nrelatively small, and much of the activity that would thereby\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nbe enjoined has  already occurred.  Moreover, Gerber  has now\r\n\nbeen denied  such broader  relief by  three separate  judges.\r\n\nHaving  reviewed the record  and the parties'  submissions in\r\n\nfull, we  are not inclined  to reach a  different assessment,\r\n\nespecially  given  the deferential  standard  of review  that\r\n\ngoverns this appeal.  See, e.g., Narragansett Indian Tribe v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nGuilbert, 934 F.2d 4, 5 (1st Cir. 1991).\r                    \r\n\n     The  motion  to  restore injunction  pending  appeal  is\r                                                                         \r\n\ndenied,  and  the order  of the  district court  is summarily\r                                                                         \r\n\naffirmed.

For almost six years, appellant Gerber Radio Supply Co.  (Gerber), a Massachusetts- based distributor of electronic components, was a non- exclusive distributor in the northeast region for Philips Semiconductors, Inc.  (Philips), a California-based manufacturer of integrated circuits.  In March 1995, Philips exercised its contractual option to terminate the distributorship agreement, effective the following month.  It thereafter sent to most or all of its remaining local distributors a computerized printout identifying some 520 customers that had bought Philips products from Gerber in 1994, along with their respective volume of purchases.  Gerber proceeded to file suit against Philips and various of the distributors in Massachusetts state court, claiming inter alia that the disclosure of its customer list (1) breached a confidentiality obligation contained in the distributorship agreement and (2) was a misappropriation of trade secrets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A superior court justice denied Gerber's request for a preliminary injunction, finding no likelihood of success on the merits.  A single justice of the appeals court, however, agreed to enter a narrow injunction requiring defendants to return all copies of the customer list and precluding them from disclosing the contents thereof to third parties.  Gerber's further request to bar defendants from soliciting the listed customers was denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter, the case was removed to federal court.  In response to Gerber's motion to extend the preliminary injunction to several defendants recently added to the case, Philips moved for its dissolution, arguing that it was defective on both substantive and procedural grounds.  Gerber replied that the district court was constrained to adhere to the single justice's ruling, but that, if any modification were to be undertaken, the injunction should be extended to preclude solicitation of its customers.  The district court agreed to dissolve the injunction on the basis that irreparable harm had not been established.  Gerber has appealed from this order, and now asks that we restore the preliminary injunction issued by the single justice pending such appeal.  For the following reasons, we deny the motion to restore and summarily affirm the order of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gerber acknowledges that a district court is authorized under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1450 to modify or dissolve a state court injunction following removal.  See, e.g., Hyde Park Partners, L.P. v. Connolly, 839 F.2d 837, 842 (1st Cir.1988).  It contends, however, that this power does not extend to a state appellate court order.  In its view, such an injunction becomes \"federalized\" once the case is removed and is thereby converted into a federal appellate court order binding on the district court.  We note that such a view diverges from the approach adopted in recent removal cases arising in an analogous context.  See, e.g., RTC v. Bayside Developers, 43 F.3d 1230, 1238 (9th Cir.1994);  LeMaire v. FDIC, 20 F.3d 654, 655 &amp; n.3 (5th Cir.1994), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 723 (1995);  In re 5300 Memorial Investors, Ltd., 973 F.2d 1160, 1162-63 (5th Cir.1992).  Yet we need not resolve this question since Gerber's argument fails for a separate reason.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is undisputed that federal rather than state procedural requirements govern the future course of proceedings in a removed case.

Here, there is no indication that the single justice, in granting equitable relief, required the posting of a bond or at least considered whether a bond was necessary-as mandated by Fed.  R. Civ.

Given this omission, and considering that the single justice's ruling was provisional in nature and lacked written findings, we think the district court was entitled to undertake a review of the state court injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We likewise conclude that the district court was warranted in dissolving the injunction.

Instead, it contends that it faces the potential loss of all 520 customers identified on the list (said to represent approximately twenty-five percent of its customer base).  Yet, having advanced no challenge to the termination of its Philips distributorship, Gerber cannot complain of the inevitable loss of those customers who retain loyalty to Philips products.  The extent to which such customers might also take their non-Philips business elsewhere is speculative at this point, but presumably subject to reasonable quantification in the future.  Most important, Gerber goes on to explain that it is concerned only with those customers who previously bought Philips products exclusively from Gerber.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  And the number of such customers-although not specified in the record-appears relatively small.  Gerber acknowledges that approximately two-thirds of its customers were also those of another distributor (defendant Wyle Electronics).  Nor has it disputed that other distributors, as well as Philips itself, have also dealt with various of its customers.  These considerations, we think, militate against any finding of irreparable harm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, restoration of the narrow injunction imposed by the single justice would accomplish little at this point.  Defendants have now been in possession of the customer list for nearly five months.  Indeed, partly because of Gerber's failure to seek an appropriate protective order, the list has been publicly available for most of that period-having been submitted (in unsealed format) as part of the record in this case.  Under these circumstances, we fail to see how Gerber would benefit from any renewed order barring disclosure of the customer list to third parties.  Cf. CMM Cable Rep., Inc. v. Ocean Coast Properties., Inc., 48 F.3d 618, 621 (1st Cir.1995) (noting that an appeal from the denial of a motion for preliminary injunction is moot if the appellate court can no longer preserve, or feasibly restore, the status quo).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the district court's decision not to extend the injunction to bar the solicitation of customers is one we are not prepared to disturb.

Moreover, Gerber has now been denied such broader relief by three separate judges.  Having reviewed the record and the parties' submissions in full, we are not inclined to reach a different assessment, especially given the deferential standard of review that governs this appeal.

For almost six years, appellant Gerber Radio Supply Co.  (Gerber), a Massachusetts- based distributor of electronic components, was a non- exclusive distributor in the northeast region for Philips Semiconductors, Inc.  (Philips), a California-based manufacturer of integrated circuits.  In March 1995, Philips exercised its contractual option to terminate the distributorship agreement, effective the following month.  It thereafter sent to most or all of its remaining local distributors a computerized printout identifying some 520 customers that had bought Philips products from Gerber in 1994, along with their respective volume of purchases.  Gerber proceeded to file suit against Philips and various of the distributors in Massachusetts state court, claiming inter alia that the disclosure of its customer list (1) breached a confidentiality obligation contained in the distributorship agreement and (2) was a misappropriation of trade secrets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A superior court justice denied Gerber's request for a preliminary injunction, finding no likelihood of success on the merits.  A single justice of the appeals court, however, agreed to enter a narrow injunction requiring defendants to return all copies of the customer list and precluding them from disclosing the contents thereof to third parties.  Gerber's further request to bar defendants from soliciting the listed customers was denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter, the case was removed to federal court.  In response to Gerber's motion to extend the preliminary injunction to several defendants recently added to the case, Philips moved for its dissolution, arguing that it was defective on both substantive and procedural grounds.  Gerber replied that the district court was constrained to adhere to the single justice's ruling, but that, if any modification were to be undertaken, the injunction should be extended to preclude solicitation of its customers.  The district court agreed to dissolve the injunction on the basis that irreparable harm had not been established.  Gerber has appealed from this order, and now asks that we restore the preliminary injunction issued by the single justice pending such appeal.  For the following reasons, we deny the motion to restore and summarily affirm the order of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gerber acknowledges that a district court is authorized under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1450 to modify or dissolve a state court injunction following removal.  See, e.g., Hyde Park Partners, L.P. v. Connolly, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"501806\"><a href=\"/opinion/501806/hyde-park-partners-lp-and-hyde-park-holdings-inc-v-michael-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">839</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span>, 842 (1st Cir.1988).  It contends, however, that this power does not extend to a state appellate court order.  In its view, such an injunction becomes \"federalized\" once the case is removed and is thereby converted into a federal appellate court order binding on the district court.  We note that such a view diverges from the approach adopted in recent removal cases arising in an analogous context.  See, e.g., RTC v. Bayside Developers, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"685660\"><a href=\"/opinion/685660/resolution-trust-corporation-as-conservator-for-great-american-first/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1230</span></a></span>, 1238 (9th Cir.1994);  LeMaire v. FDIC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"666873\"><a href=\"/opinion/666873/harry-lemaire-hilmar-r-zeissig-v-the-federal-deposit-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">654</span></a></span>, 655 &amp; n.3 (5th Cir.1994), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">723</span></span> (1995);  In re 5300 Memorial Investors, Ltd., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"589979\"><a href=\"/opinion/589979/in-the-matter-of-5300-memorial-investors-ltd-debtor-5300-memorial/\"><span class=\"volume\">973</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1160</span></a></span>, 1162-63 (5th Cir.1992).  Yet we need not resolve this question since Gerber's argument fails for a separate reason.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is undisputed that federal rather than state procedural requirements govern the future course of proceedings in a removed case.  See, e.g., Granny Goose Foods, Inc. v. Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local 70, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108983\"><a href=\"/opinion/108983/granny-goose-foods-inc-v-teamsters/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">423</span></a></span>, 437 &amp; n.10 (1974);  FDIC v. Bay Street Dev.  Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195566\"><a href=\"/opinion/195566/fdic-v-byrne-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">636</span></a></span>, 639 (1st Cir.1994).  Here, there is no indication that the single justice, in granting equitable relief, required the posting of a bond or at least considered whether a bond was necessary-as mandated by Fed.  R. Civ. P. 65(c).  See, e.g., In re Kingsley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"477757\"><a href=\"/opinion/477757/in-the-matter-of-the-application-of-michael-j-kingsley-for-the-return-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">802</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">571</span></a></span>, 578 (1st Cir.1986).  Given this omission, and considering that the single justice's ruling was provisional in nature and lacked written findings, we think the district court was entitled to undertake a review of the state court injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We likewise conclude that the district court was warranted in dissolving the injunction.  In so concluding, we express no view as to the merits of Gerber's underlying action.  Instead, we rely on three considerations.  First, we are inclined to agree that irreparable harm has not been demonstrated under the circumstances.  Gerber does not suggest that its economic viability is threatened;  indeed, sales of Philips products accounted for only seven to eleven percent of its business in recent years.  Instead, it contends that it faces the potential loss of all 520 customers identified on the list (said to represent approximately twenty-five percent of its customer base).  Yet, having advanced no challenge to the termination of its Philips distributorship, Gerber cannot complain of the inevitable loss of those customers who retain loyalty to Philips products.  The extent to which such customers might also take their non-Philips business elsewhere is speculative at this point, but presumably subject to reasonable quantification in the future.  Most important, Gerber goes on to explain that it is concerned only with those customers who previously bought Philips products exclusively from Gerber.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  And the number of such customers-although not specified in the record-appears relatively small.  Gerber acknowledges that approximately two-thirds of its customers were also those of another distributor (defendant Wyle Electronics).  Nor has it disputed that other distributors, as well as Philips itself, have also dealt with various of its customers.  These considerations, we think, militate against any finding of irreparable harm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, restoration of the narrow injunction imposed by the single justice would accomplish little at this point.

Indeed, partly because of Gerber's failure to seek an appropriate protective order, the list has been publicly available for most of that period-having been submitted (in unsealed format) as part of the record in this case.  Under these circumstances, we fail to see how Gerber would benefit from any renewed order barring disclosure of the customer list to third parties.  Cf. CMM Cable Rep., Inc. v.
