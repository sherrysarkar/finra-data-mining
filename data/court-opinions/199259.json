Kathleen Gass seeks to stop\n\nthe government from seizing her family home at 221 Dana\n\nAvenue, in Hyde Park, Massachusetts.     The government seeks to\n\nseize the property because Kathleen Gass' late husband,\n\nWilliam Gass, used it for his side business as a drug dealer,\n\nunbeknownst to his wife and child.     Mrs. Gass first learned\n\nher husband had used the ground floor apartment for cocaine\n\ndeals on the day the government arrested him and raided the\n\nproperty.    Mr. Gass, in whose name the house stood, made out a\n\nwill and left Kathleen Gass the house.     Within ten days, he\n\ncommitted suicide.\n\n            The government then started forfeiture proceedings.\n\nAt the close of evidence, the district court granted the\n\ngovernment's motion for a directed verdict and denied Kathleen\n\nGass' motion for entry of judgment.     The court concluded that\n\nKathleen Gass was not entitled to assert the \"innocent owner\"\n\ndefense, see 21 U.S.C.A. § 881(a)(7) (1999), since she did not\n\npossess an ownership interest in the property until after she\n\nhad learned that the property had been used for drug dealing.\n\nThe court also concluded that forfeiture of the property did\n\nnot constitute an excessive fine under the Eighth Amendment to\n\n                                -2-\n\fthe Constitution.   We now vacate the decision of the district\n\ncourt and direct dismissal of the government’s forfeiture case with\n\nprejudice on the ground that claimant has satisfied the requirements\n\nof the innocent owner defense.\n\n\n\n\n                                 I.\n\n          The facts are undisputed.      On February 5, 1990,\n\nWilliam Gass purchased the property at 221 Dana Avenue, in\n\nHyde Park, Massachusetts.   The deed was issued solely in his\n\nname.   Kathleen Gass has lived at the property with William\n\nGass since 1990, and currently resides there, along with the\n\ncouple's eight year old son, Cedric Gass.      William and\n\nKathleen Gass were married on January 8, 1995, but William did\n\nnot convey an interest in the property to Mrs. Gass.         For the\n\npast decade, Mrs. Gass has worked as an accountant for the\n\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development, where she earns\n\napproximately $30,000 per year.       Although she did not\n\ncontribute money towards the purchase price of the home or to\n\nmortgage payments made before or during her marriage to\n\nWilliam Gass, Kathleen Gass consistently contributed to other\n\nessential financial needs of the household, including food and\n\n                              -3-\n\fclothing.    Moreover, since her husband's suicide on January\n\n29, 1998, Mrs. Gass has made the mortgage payments on the\n\nproperty and has made improvements to the property.\n\n            Mr. Gass operated a taxi cab business out of the\n\nhome.   The office for the business was located in a separate\n\napartment on the first floor.    The second floor served as the\n\nfamily home.    Mrs. Gass rarely entered the first floor area,\n\nand did not even have a key to her husband's office.\n\n            In early 1997, the Drug Enforcement Agency and\n\nUnited States Customs Service started an investigation of\n\nWilliam Gass for suspected cocaine distribution.    In 1997, the\n\nagents, with the assistance of a confidential informant,\n\narranged several controlled drug buys with Mr. Gass at the\n\nproperty.    On January 8, 1998, Mr. Gass was arrested and\n\ncharged with cocaine distribution.    Later that day, agents\n\nexecuted a search warrant on the property.    Mr. Gass confessed\n\nand accompanied the agents to the property, where he retrieved\n\nand turned over to agents 490 grams of cocaine and $59,000.\n\nAgents also found a white bucket and scale which had been\n\nused, according to the confidential informant, to weigh the\n\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fcocaine.   The search was the first time Mrs. Gass became aware\n\nof her husband's cocaine distribution activities.\n\n           On January 19, 1998, William Gass executed a will\n\ndevising all of his property to his wife.   On January 29,\n\n1998, he committed suicide at the property.\n\n           The government filed a complaint for forfeiture of\n\nthe property on February 3, 1998.    On February 4, 1998, the\n\ndistrict court found that probable cause existed to believe\n\nthe property was subject to forfeiture, and a monition\n\nissued.1   Kathleen Gass was appointed executrix of her\n\nhusband's will on June 28, 1998.\n\n\n\n\n     1    In a civil forfeiture case, the government must first\nestablish probable cause to believe that a nexus existed between\nthe property and specified illegal activity sufficient to\njustify forfeiture. This shifts the burden to the claimant, who\nmust refute the government's prima facie case either (1) by\ndemonstrating that the property was not in fact used for the\nspecified illegal activity or (2) by proving that she (the\nclaimant) did not know about or consent to the illicit activity.\nSee, e.g., United States v. 15 Bosworth St., No. 00-1215, 2001\nWL 2076, at *3 (1st Cir. Jan. 4, 2001); United States v. Cunan,\n156 F.3d 110, 116 n.7 (1st Cir. 1998) (internal citations\nomitted). The second of these avenues is commonly called the\n\"innocent owner\" defense, and it must be established by a\npreponderance of the evidence. See 15 Bosworth St., 2001 WL\n2076, at *3.\n\n                               -5-\n\f         A jury trial on the forfeiture action started on\n\nOctober 18, 1999.   At the close of evidence, the government\n\nmoved for a directed verdict pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50.\n\nClaimant Kathleen Gass moved for entry of judgment pursuant to\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 58.   Over claimant's objection, the district\n\ncourt dismissed the jury since there were no factual disputes\n\nto resolve, and ordered additional briefing.    On January 3,\n\n2000, the court granted the government's motion for a directed\n\nverdict and denied claimant's motion for entry of judgment.\n\n         The court rejected both of claimant's central\n\narguments: (1) that she was an \"innocent owner\" under 21\n\nU.S.C.A. § 881(a)(7) (1999); and (2) that forfeiture of the\n\nproperty would constitute an excessive fine in violation of\n\nthe Eighth Amendment.   See United States v. 221 Dana Ave., 81\n\nF. Supp. 2d 182 (D. Mass. 2000).    As to the \"innocent owner\"\n\ndefense, the court held that claimant could not prevail\n\nbecause, although entirely unaware of the illegal activities\n\nwhen they were occurring, she nonetheless knew of the\n\nproperty's tainted character before obtaining an ownership\n\ninterest in it following her husband's death.   Id. at 189\n\n(holding that claimant's knowledge is to be measured \"at the\n\n                              -6-\n\ftime she acquired her property interest as an heir\").\n\nSpecifically, the court concluded that claimant's spousal\n\nright to equitable distribution of marital property upon\n\ndivorce did not confer an equitable or legal ownership\n\ninterest independent of a divorce proceeding.   See id. at 186-\n\n87.   The district court also determined that Mrs. Gass had no\n\nresulting trust in the home because she did not contribute to\n\nthe mortgage payments on or the purchase price of the home.\n\nSee id. at 187.   Additionally, the court rejected claimant's\n\nargument that her dower interest or, alternatively, her\n\ninterest as an heir under her husband's will, provided a\n\nsufficient ownership interest to enable her to assert the\n\ninnocent owner defense.   See id. at 188-89.   In reaching this\n\nconclusion, the court accepted the government's contention\n\nthat to allow a claimant to avoid forfeiture simply by\n\nestablishing lack of knowledge at the time illegal conduct\n\noccurred would create \"a major loophole in the forfeiture\n\nscheme,\" whereby \"[c]riminals could simply keep family and\n\nfriends out of the loop, and then transfer property to them to\n\navoid forfeiture.\"   Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n\n                              -7-\n\f         As to claimant's Eighth Amendment argument, the\n\ndistrict court concluded that the fine was not excessive\n\nbecause the harshness of the forfeiture, although significant,\n\nwas outweighed by, inter alia, the seriousness of her\n\nhusband's offense, the lengthy sentence and fine he could have\n\nreceived, and the close relationship between the property and\n\nthe offense. See id. at 191-92 (applying formulation of hybrid\n\ninstrumentality-proportionality test set forth in United\n\nStates v. Milbrand, 58 F.3d 841, 847-48 (2d Cir. 1995)).2\n\nAdditionally, the court rejected claimant's argument that\n\nseizing the entire property would constitute an excessive fine\n\nin a situation where the illegal activity was confined to a\n\nseparate first floor apartment in the home.   See 221 Dana\n\nAve., 81 F. Supp. 2d at 192 (\"A[n] entire parcel of land may\n\nbe subject to forfeiture under 21 U.S.C. § 881(a)(7) even if\n\nonly part of it is directly connected to drug activity.\").\n\n                              II.\n\n\n    2     The court also concluded that under an instrumentality\ntest, the forfeiture of the subject property \"easily survives\"\nEighth Amendment scrutiny because a \"'substantial connection'\nexists between the property and the drug distribution crimes\nwith which Mr. Gass was charged.\" Id. at 190 (quoting United\nStates v. 28 Emery St., 914 F.2d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir. 1990)).\n\n                              -8-\n\f          We review de novo the grant of a Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a)\n\nmotion for judgment as a matter of law, using the same standards as\n\nthe district court.     E.g., Russo v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., 140 F.3d\n\n6, 8 (1st Cir. 1998).     The evidence and inferences drawn from the\n\nevidence are considered in the light most favorable to the non-moving\n\nparty (here, the claimant), drawing all reasonable inferences in that\n\nparty's favor.   Id.; Collazo-Santiago v. Toyota Motor Corp., 149 F.3d\n\n23, 26 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n          Our principal task is to ascertain whether Congress\n\nintended the forfeiture provisions of the old civil forfeiture\n\nstatute3 to trump the \"innocent owner\" defense on these facts.          The\n\ntext of the statute does not address the issue; it provides only:\n\n          that no property shall be forfeited under this paragraph,\n          to the extent of an interest of an owner, by reason of any\n          act or omission established by that owner to have been\n          committed or omitted without the knowledge or consent of\n          that owner.\n\n21 U.S.C.A. § 881(a)(7) (1999).       This language does not answer a\n\nnumber of questions that arise, such as the nature of the ownership\n\n\n\n     3    See 21 U.S.C.A. § 881 (1999). Congress recently amended\nthe forfeiture statute through the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act\nof 2000. See Pub. L. No. 106-185, 114 Stat. 202, 18 U.S.C. § 983\n(U.S.C.A. Supp. 2000). However, the newly amended innocent owner\ndefense applies only to those forfeiture proceedings \"commenced on or\nafter the date that is 120 days after [April 25, 2000].\" Pub. L. No.\n106-185, § 21, 114 Stat. at 225; 18 U.S.C. § 983, historical and\nstatutory notes. The forfeiture proceeding here was commenced on\nFebruary 3, 1998, and so the amended innocent owner defense does not\napply to this case.\n\n                                -9-\n\finterests that must be held by the innocent \"owner\" and   at what time\n\nthe \"innocence\" of the owner (in terms of lack of \"knowledge or\n\nconsent\") is to be measured.\n\n          The legislative history also offers little guidance,\n\nalthough it does instruct us that \"[t]he term 'owner' should be\n\nbroadly interpreted to include any person with a recognizable legal\n\nor equitable interest in the property seized.\"   Joint Explanatory\n\nStatement of Titles II and III, Pub. L. No. 95-633, 95th Cong. 2d\n\nSess. (Oct. 7, 1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 9496, 9518,\n\n9522.\n\n          The Supreme Court has construed these statutory terms only\n\nonce.   See United States v. 92 Buena Vista Ave., 507 U.S. 111 (1993)\n\n(plurality opinion).   From that decision we know that: (1) the term\n\n\"owner\" is not limited to bona fide purchasers, id. at 123; (2) for\n\npurposes of the relation back doctrine, the government does not\n\nbecome the owner of property before forfeiture has been decreed, and\n\nsomeone who acquires an ownership interest after the illegal acts\n\nhave occurred may therefore still assert the innocent owner defense,\n\nid. at 123-29; and (3) equitable considerations may play some role in\n\nconstruing the statute, id. at 130 (leaving undecided whether\n\n\"equitable doctrines may foreclose the assertion of an innocent owner\n\ndefense by a party with guilty knowledge of the tainted character of\n\n\n\n\n                               -10-\n\fthe property\"); see also United States v. 10936 Oak Run Circle, 9\n\nF.3d 74, 76 (9th Cir. 1993).\n\n          The courts have created various doctrines over the years\n\nintended to deal with the practical considerations of how best to\n\neffectuate the twin legislative objectives behind forfeiture: the\n\ndeterrence of drug activities by forfeiture of property involved and\n\nthe protection of the innocent from loss of their property interests\n\nby virtue of their association with drug criminals.         See United\n\nStates v. 6640 S.W. 48th St., 41 F.3d 1448, 1452 (11th Cir. 1995).4\n\nThe deterrence objective applies to both use of drug proceeds and use\n\n\n\n\n     4     When Congress first authorized the seizure and forfeiture\nof proceeds of illegal drug transactions in 1978, it \"marked an\nimportant expansion of governmental power\"; previously, the federal\ndrug forfeiture statute had authorized only the seizure of the illegal\nsubstances themselves and the instruments by which they were\nmanufactured and distributed. 92 Buena Vista Ave., 507 U.S. at 121-22.\nForfeiture of the proceeds of illegal drug transactions was initially\nlimited to all moneys, negotiable instruments, securities, and other\nthings of value furnished by any person in exchange for a controlled\nsubstance, and all proceeds traceable to the exchange.              See\nPsychotropic Substances Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-633, 92 Stat. 3768,\n3777. In 1984, Congress enacted section 306(a) of the Comprehensive\nCrime Control Act, which further expanded civil forfeiture to reach all\nreal property used in violation of the statute. See Pub. L. No. 98-\n473, 98 Stat. 2050 (1984) (codified at 21 U.S.C. § 881(a)(7) (1988)).\nThis measure was \"designed to enhance the use of forfeiture . . . in\ncombatting two of the most serious crime problems facing the country:\nracketeering and drug trafficking.\" S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 191 (1984),\nreprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3374. Congress believed that\nsuccessful law enforcement in this area depended on attacking \"the\neconomic aspects\" of such crimes through such measures. Id.\n\n                                 -11-\n\fof property as an instrument for drug dealing.5       As part of its\n\ndeterrence objective, forfeiture is meant to prevent drug dealers\n\nfrom benefitting from their crimes by putting their profits from drug\n\nactivities in other hands and also to discourage those associated\n\nwith drug dealers from facilitating or even consenting to such\n\ncrimes.\n\n            The courts of appeals, including this court, have\n\ngenerally agreed that state law provides the source of the property\n\ninterests that determine the applicability of the innocent owner\n\ndefense to federal forfeiture complaints.       See, e.g., United States\n\nv. U.S. Currency, $81,000.00, 189 F.3d 28, 33 (1st Cir. 1999); United\n\nStates v. One 1973 Rolls Royce, 43 F.3d 794, 805 n. 8 (3rd Cir.\n\n1994); United States v. 1977 Porsche Carrera 911, 946 F.2d 30, 34\n\n(5th Cir. 1991); United States v. 2525 LeRoy Lane, 910 F.2d 343, 347\n\n(6th Cir. 1990).\n\n            The agreement of the courts of appeals ends, however, when\n\nanother issue is reached.     It is the resolution of that issue which\n\nthe government argues should provide the rule of decision for this\n\ncase.     The issue is whether the court should look to the claimant’s\n\n\n\n\n     5     92 Buena Vista Ave. involved a claim that drug monies had\nbeen used to purchase a home. See 507 U.S. at 114. No such claim is\nmade here; rather, the only claim is that drug activities were carried\nout in a separate first floor apartment sometime after the home had\nalready been purchased.\n\n                                -12-\n\fknowledge at the time of property transfer, or, instead, to his or\n\nher knowledge at the time of commission of the illegal acts.    The\n\ngovernment says that the majority rule is that the claimant's\n\nknowledge at the time of transfer governs.   The rationale is that the\n\nalternative rule, which would look to a claimant’s knowledge at the\n\ntime of the illegal acts, would eviscerate the forfeiture statute by\n\nallowing criminals to protect their otherwise forfeitable property\n\ninterests by simply transferring them to a relative or a friend.      The\n\nrule the government proposes has been applied, for example, by the\n\nEleventh Circuit in 6640 S.W. 48th St., supra.   There, the court held\n\nthat if a transferee knows about illegal activity that would make the\n\nproperty subject to forfeiture at the time he takes his property\n\ninterest, he cannot assert an innocent owner defense.   See 41 F.3d at\n\n1453; see also 10936 Oak Run Circle, 9 F.3d at 76 (\"[T]he statute\n\nbars an owner with knowledge of the origin of the property in drug\n\nproceeds from asserting 'the innocent owner defense.'\"); United\n\nStates v. 352 Northup St., 40 F. Supp. 2d 74, 81-82 (D.R.I. 1999)\n\n(rejecting innocent owner defense where court disbelieved father's\n\ntestimony that he knew nothing of his son's narcotics trafficking,\n\nwhich provided the funds to purchase the property); United States v.\n\n3 Parcels in La Plata County, Colo., 919 F. Supp. 1449, 1458 (D. Nev.\n\n1995) (claimant must \"show the absence of any guilty knowledge with\n\n\n\n\n                             -13-\n\frespect to the use of the property or the source of the funds with\n\nwhich it had been purchased\").\n\n         The government would apply this rule here to say that\n\nclaimant cannot be an innocent owner because she knew of her\n\nhusband's crimes at the time she took title, which, at the earliest,\n\nwas not until her husband's death.   See Lonstein v. Rockman, 950 F.2d\n\n77, 80 (1st Cir. 1991) (title vests upon allowance of the will by the\n\nprobate court, but \"the passing of title is deemed to have related\n\nback to the date of the testator's death\");   Shrewsbury v. Murphy,\n\n130 N.E.2d 559, 560 (Mass. 1955) (real property passes directly to\n\nthe heirs upon the decedent's death).\n\n         One circuit, the government acknowledges, does not follow\n\nsuch a rule.6   Specifically, the Third Circuit has held that the\n\ninnocent owner defense is available to a claimant who shows that he\n\nor she did not own the property at the time of the drug transaction,\n\n\n    6     Additionally, Justice Scalia, in his concurring opinion\nin 92 Buena Vista Ave., supra, suggested that it would not be\nabsurd to think that post-illegal-act transferees who knew about\nthe illegal act creating the taint at the time of transfer, but\nnot at the time the act occurred, were beyond the reach of the\nforfeiture statutes.      See 507 U.S. at 139 (Scalia, J.,\nconcurring) (\"I do not find inconceivable the possibility that\npost-illegal-act transferees with post-illegal-act knowledge of\nthe earlier illegality are provided a defense against\nforfeiture. The Government would still be entitled to the\nproperty held by the drug dealer and by close friends and\nrelatives who are unable to meet their burden of proof as to\nignorance of the illegal act when it occurred.\").\n\n                              -14-\n\fand was not therefore in a position to consent to its use to\n\nfacilitate drug crimes.     See One 1973 Rolls Royce, 43 F.3d at 819;\n\nsee also United States v. 1993 Bentley Coupe, 986 F. Supp. 893, 897-\n\n98 (D.N.J. 1998) (applying One 1973 Rolls Royce).7        The government\n\nurges that we adopt the first rule and reject the rule adopted by the\n\nThird Circuit, as the Eleventh Circuit has done.\n\n          The government’s interest in having bright-line tests for\n\nforfeiture is certainly legitimate.       Such tests are easy to\n\nadminister.   They are more predictable and hence provide clearer\n\nnotice.   It may be that common situations can be governed by bright-\n\nline tests.   But the tests cannot be unmoored from the settings to\n\nwhich they are applied, and no single rule can adequately cover all\n\n     7     In United States v. 6109 Grubb Road, 886 F.2d 618 (3d Cir.\n1989), the Third Circuit had previously held that an owner who had\nknowledge that the property was tainted by illegal drug transactions\nwould still be considered an innocent owner upon a showing that he did\nnot consent to the use that caused the taint. See 886 F.2d at 626.\nSpecifically, the court read in the disjunctive the language in 21\nU.S.C. § 881(a)(7) barring forfeiture if the claimant could show lack\nof knowledge or consent. It therefore allowed the claimant to show\neither one or the other, as opposed to requiring that he show both.\nSee id. In One 1973 Rolls Royce, the Third Circuit held that the 6109\nGrubb Road analysis applied equally to pre-illegal-act owners (the\nsituation in 6109 Grubb Road) and post-illegal act owners (the\nsituation in One 1973 Rolls Royce). See 43 F.3d at 819 (\"if [claimant]\ncan show that he did not know that the [property] was being used or\ngoing to be used [in connection with the illegal transactions] at the\ntime they took place, then he will be able to show that he did not\nconsent to the use and, under 6109 Grubb Road, will be entitled to the\ninnocent owner defense\"). Here, however, neither party has argued\nthat the issue turns on whether we read § 881(a)(7)'s reference to\n\"knowledge or consent\" in the conjunctive or disjunctive, and therefore\nwe do not reach that issue.\n\n                                 -15-\n\fsituations.    More fundamentally, such tests must aim to carry out the\n\ndual purposes of Congress in enacting the forfeiture statute: the\n\ndeterrence of drug crimes and the protection of innocent owners.\n\nAlthough Congress's purposes are somewhat at odds with each other, we\n\ndo not view the issue before us in quite the same terms as the\n\ngovernment -- that is, as posing a choice between a Scylla and a\n\nCharybdis, threatening to do harm to one of Congress's purposes or\n\nthe other.    To the contrary, we see no congressional purpose\n\nfurthered by rejecting claimant's innocent owner defense on these\n\nfacts.\n\n         The government's argument here has several problems.       Most\n\nimportantly, it skips past the fact that, under Massachusetts law,\n\nclaimant had a partial interest in the property, the marital home, at\n\nthe time of the illegal activity, and that interest existed long\n\nbefore she knew that her husband was dealing drugs.    Thus, as to\n\nthose interests, we need not reach the broader question of whether,\n\nunder other circumstances, the innocent owner defense may be asserted\n\nby a post-illegal-act transferee with post-illegal-act knowledge --\n\nthat is, by a claimant who knew about the illegal activities when he\n\nor she acquired the property interest, but who did not know about\n\nthose activities when they were occurring.    Rather, because the\n\nclaimant in this case had a partial interest in the property prior to\n\nlearning about the illegal activities, and because the congressional\n\n\n                               -16-\n\fpurpose of deterring drug crimes would not be served by forfeiture,\n\nwe conclude that she may assert the innocent owner defense.\n\n           We start with the uncontroverted fact that claimant knew\n\nnothing of her husband's drug dealing while it was going on. She\n\nlearned of it only after his arrest, and there was no further illegal\n\nactivity thereafter.   She thus clearly satisfies the\n\n\"innocence\" prong of the innocent owner defense, at least as of the\n\ntime before the arrest.   The question then is whether she had a\n\nsufficient interest in the property at this time to also qualify as\n\nan \"owner\" as to that interest.   We think the answer is yes.\n\n           Claimant had a type of property interest created by\n\nMassachusetts in an effort to protect a spouse's interest in marital\n\nproperty in the event the marriage ends, whether by death or by\n\ndivorce.   In the case of a spouse's death, Massachusetts recognizes\n\nseveral protected interests, including the dower interest, whereby a\n\nsurviving spouse receives a life estate in one third of all real\n\nproperty owned by the deceased spouse at the time of death.      See\n\nM.G.L.A. ch. 189, § 1.8   The Commonwealth also protects surviving\n\n\n    8     Formerly, a husband received a life estate in one third\nof all land owned by the wife upon her death, known as tenancy\nby curtesy, while the wife received a life estate in one third\nof all land owned by her husband upon his death, known as\ntenancy by dower. The distinction between curtesy and dower has\nbeen eliminated, and dower has been made available to either\nspouse.    See M.G.L.A. ch. 305, § 1A (1978); 21 Dunphy,\nMassachusetts Practice § 7.1, at 95 (2d ed. 1997).\n\n                              -17-\n\fspouses against being intentionally or inadvertently\n\ndisinherited under the deceased spouse's will by allowing the\n\nsurviving spouse to waive the will and take a share of the\n\ndecedent spouse's estate as prescribed by the elective share\n\nstatute; if the deceased statute left issue, the surviving\n\nspouse may waive the will and elect to receive at least one\n\nthird of all real and personal property.   See id. ch. 191, §\n\n15; 14C Alperin & Shubow, Massachusetts Practice § 22.31 (3d\n\ned. 1996).   In situations where a spouse died intestate,\n\n\n          The common law property concept of dower developed\nduring the middle ages in England, when land was the main source\nof wealth and the basis of an agrarian society.       Under the\nsystem of femme covert, husband and wife merged into a single\nlegal identity, and all of a woman's property and earnings\nbelonged to her husband. In return for relinquishing control\nover all of her property, the law of dower required that the\nhusband provide his wife with support and maintenance,\nespecially during her widowhood. Dower rights, which attached\nto the land at the moment of marriage, generally allowed a wife\na one third share in a life estate in all freehold land that the\nhusband owned during the marriage and that was inheritable by\nthe legal heirs of the husband and wife.       See Kathleen M.\nO'Connor, Note, Marital Property Reform in Massachusetts: A\nChoice for the New Millennium, 34 New. Eng. L. Rev. 261, 272-75\n(1999).   During the nineteenth century, Massachusetts, like\nother states, passed married women's property acts which gave\nwives greater rights over property and earnings, including the\nright to keep and manage as their own property that they had\nbrought to or acquired after the marriage by gift, inheritance,\nbequest, or devise. See id. at 303 (describing Massachusetts\nlegislation passed in 1845).\n\n                              -18-\n\fMassachusetts' statute of descent and distribution provides\n\nthat the surviving spouse is entitled to inherit varying\n\nshares of the deceased spouse's estate depending on whether\n\nthe deceased spouse is also survived by issue or kindred; if\n\nthe deceased spouse left issue, that surviving spouse takes\n\none half of the personal and real property outright.         See\n\nM.G.L.A. ch. 190, § 1; 14A Alperin & Shubow, supra, § 11.24.9\n\nHere, claimant's dower interest amounted to a life estate in one\n\nthird of the property located at 221 Dana Avenue.10\n\n          It is true that Massachusetts law describes these dower\n\ninterests during marriage as \"inchoate,\" Opinion of the Justices, 151\n\nN.E.2d 475, 476-78, 480 (Mass. 1958), and, as the district court\n\naccurately noted, they are not full ownership interests, see 221 Dana\n\n\n     9    While the dower interest is a life estate in real\nproperty, M.G.L.A. ch. 189, § 1, both a surviving spouse's\nelective share, id. ch. 191, § 15, and intestate share, id. ch.\n190, § 1, are interests in fee simple. In light of these other\nprotections, it is generally no longer advisable for a surviving\nspouse to claim dower, except under unusual circumstances (such\nas when the decedent has extensive debts, over which the dower\ninterest had priority). See 21 Dunphy, supra, § 7.1, at 96; see\nalso DuMont v. Godbey, 415 N.E.2d 188, 190 (Mass. 1981) (\"Theoretically\nthe surviving spouse could instead claim dower . . . but the dower\ninterest would in most cases be less valuable [than the spouse's\nintestate share].\").\n     10   Although dower is taken subject to any encumbrances on the\nland at the time of death, M.G.L.A. ch. 189, § 1, there was no\nencumbrance in favor of the United States at the time of death.\n\n                                 -19-\n\fAve., 81 F. Supp. 2d at 188-89 (discussing dower rights).     The\n\nMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has nonetheless described the\n\ndower interest as \"something more than a possibility, and as an\n\ninterest in property, which equity will under some circumstances\n\nprotect at the suit of the wife in the lifetime of the husband.\"\n\nOpinion of the Justices, 151 N.E.2d at 478; see also Davis v.\n\nWetherell, 95 Mass. 60, 1866 WL 4942, at *2 (1866) (\"[A wife's]\n\ninchoate right of dower is a right of a very peculiar nature.       It is\n\na right of which nothing but her death or voluntary act can deprive\n\nher, and so it is something more than a mere possibility.\").\n\nMoreover, under traditional dower rights doctrine, Mr. Gass lacked\n\nthe power, acting without claimant's consent, to encumber or sell her\n\ndower interest.   See Opinion of the Justices, 151 N.E.2d at 476-78;\n\nsee also Taylor v. Gowetz, 158 N.E.2d 677, 680 (Mass. 1959)\n\n(discussing agreement whereby wife released, inter alia, dower\n\nrights); Mathews v. Orlandella, 69 N.E.2d 571, 572 (Mass. 1946)\n\n(evidence supported finding that \"wife authorized the defendant\n\nhusband . . . to sell whatever interest she had [in the property],\n\nwhether it was in her own right or was merely an inchoate right of\n\ndower\").   The right of dower is superior to any claims of creditors\n\n\n\n\n                              -20-\n\fon the estate of the deceased.   See Opinion of the Justices, 151\n\nN.E.2d at 476; 21 Dunphy, supra, § 7.1, at 96.11\n\n         In the event of divorce, although a spouse loses the dower\n\ninterest, see M.G.L.A. ch. 208, § 27, Massachusetts law, in a sense,\n\ncompensates by providing for an equitable distribution of marital\n\nproperty, see id. ch. 208, § 34 (\"In addition to or in lieu of a\n\njudgment to pay alimony, the court may assign to either husband or\n\nwife all or any part of the estate of the other . . . .   In fixing\n\nthe nature and value of the property to be so assigned, the court . .\n\n. . may also consider the contribution of each of the parties in the\n\nacquisition, preservation or appreciation in value of their\n\nrespective estates and the contribution of each of the parties as a\n\nhomemaker to the family unit.\"); Williams v. Massa, 728 N.E.2d 932,\n\n943 (Mass. 2000) (\"The parties' respective contributions to the\n\nmarital partnership remain the touchstone of an equitable division of\n\nthe marital estate.\") (internal quotation marks omitted); Heins v.\n\nLedis, 664 N.E.2d 10, 15 (Mass. 1996) (\"Alimony is an award for\n\nsupport and maintenance and has historically been based on the common\n\nlaw duty of the husband to support his wife.   Property division, on\n\nthe other hand, is based on the joint contribution of the spouses to\n\n\n\n    11    In contrast, the intestate share and elective share do\nnot take precedence over claims of creditors. See 14C Alperin\n& Shubow, supra, § 22.32.\n\n                              -21-\n\fthe marital enterprise.\") (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nAlthough the interest of a divorced spouse is not involved in this\n\ncase, Massachusetts's equitable distribution statute further\n\ndemonstrates the coherence and consistency of the Commonwealth's\n\nscheme of protecting spouses, including a spouse's interest in the\n\nreal property owned separately by the other spouse.    See generally,\n\ne.g., 14A Alperin & Shubow, supra,    § 11.1 (\"Although formed by\n\ncontract, marriage creates a status from which arise automatically\n\nproperty rights of support, dower, and a share in the estate of a\n\ndeceased spouse.\") (internal footnotes omitted).\n\n           As it turned out, claimant's husband made a will leaving\n\nher all his property.    However, this simply had the effect of giving\n\nher the interest in intestacy that her child would have held had her\n\nhusband not made the will.    See M.G.L.A. ch. 190, § 1.   It also\n\nhad the effect of removing any reason for claimant to timely file her\n\nelection and claim of her dower interest in the property to avoid\n\nwaiver, see id. ch. 189, § 1, the property having been bequeathed to\n\nher in its entirety.12   Thus, we disagree with the district court’s\n\nconclusion that because claimant did not act to preserve her dower\n\nrights, she lost any effect those rights might have had on the\n\n\n    12    Even if there had been no will, claimant would not have\nhad any reason to claim her dower interest here since her share\nof the property under the state law of intestacy would have been\ngreater. See id. ch. 190, § 1.\n\n                               -22-\n\fquestion of whether she had a sufficient ownership interest in the\n\nproperty.    See 221 Dana Ave., 81 F. Supp. 2d at 188.\n\n            We recognize that the Tenth Circuit in United States v.\n\n9844 South Titan Court, 75 F.3d 1470 (10th Cir. 1996), held that\n\nwhere a spouse has only an inchoate interest in marital property,\n\nthat interest does not amount to an ownership interest for purposes\n\nof asserting an innocent owner defense.    See id. at 1477-78.     The\n\ncase is distinguishable because Colorado law, there the relevant\n\nstate law, differs from Massachusetts law as to the nature of the\n\ninchoate interest.    Indeed, Colorado appears to adhere to a doctrine\n\nthat Massachusetts explicitly rejected in Opinion of the Justices,\n\nsupra, where the SJC distinguished other jurisdictions' doctrine that\n\ninchoate rights are \"not an interest in property, but a mere\n\npossibility, created by law, and not in any sense vested or\n\nassignable until after the husband's death.\"    151 N.E.2d at 477-78.\n\nNor did the Tenth Circuit consider the argument, advanced by claimant\n\nhere, that an interest in property for purposes of sustaining the\n\ninnocent owner defense arises from    a spouse's dower interest.\n\n            In short, given the special protection accorded the\n\nclaimant's dower interest under Massachusetts law, we think the\n\nclaimant had a sufficient ownership interest in the property prior to\n\nher learning about her husband's illegal activities to allow her to\n\nmaintain an innocent owner defense as to that interest.    See United\n\n\n                               -23-\n\fStates v. 116 Emerson Street, 942 F.2d 74, 79-80 (1st Cir.\n\n1991) (recognizing wife's ownership interest in property in\n\nforfeiture action by way of a resulting trust, whereby wife and\n\nhusband had agreed that he would pay downpayment, she would make\n\nmortgage payments in the same amount, and both would take an interest\n\nin the home); United States v. 15621 S.W. 209th Ave., 894 F.2d 1511,\n\n1516 (11th Cir. 1990) (using Florida law to determine the property\n\ninterests and determining that no interest exists that can presently\n\nbe forfeited to the government in property held in tenancy by the\n\nentirety); United States v. East Half Section 12, 131 F.R.D. 171, 174\n\n(D. Neb. 1990) (state statute giving a surviving spouse \"the right to\n\ntake a share of a deceased spouse's real estate, in lieu of what he\n\nor she may receive under a will\" creates a property interest for\n\npurposes of the federal forfeiture statute).13   At a minimum, that\n\nownership interest is her dower interest in one third of the\n\nproperty.14   This raises the question of any remaining interests in\n\n\n\n\n     13   As the Eleventh Circuit observed in 15621 S.W. 209th\nAve., \"[b]oth theory and the precedents of [the Supreme] Court\nteach us solicitude for state interests, particularly in the\nfield of family and family-property arrangements.\" Id. at 1519\n(quoting United States v. Yazell, 382 U.S. 341, 352 (1966).\n     14   For present purposes, we need not distinguish between\nthe life estate interest of dower and the fee simple interest\nunder the elective share statutes and descent and distribution\nstatute. See supra note 9.\n\n                               -24-\n\fthe property.     See 21 U.S.C.A. § 881(a)(7) (1999) (innocent owner\n\nprotected from forfeiture \"to the extent of the [ownership]\n\ninterest\").\n\n          We do not know whether the government, if it had\n\nrecognized that Mrs. Gass was an innocent owner of a one third\n\ninterest, would have exercised its prosecutorial discretion to\n\nattempt to forfeit any arguable remaining interest.        In fact, the\n\ngovernment's forfeiture papers claim only an interest in the entire\n\nproperty, not a lesser interest.       We have little reason to assume the\n\ngovernment would have done so, given the equities of the situation.\n\nBut assuming arguendo the government intends the present action to\n\nreach any remaining interests, such effort fails because forfeiture\n\nwould not, on these facts, serve any congressional purpose behind the\n\nforfeiture statute.\n\n          It is far from clear that Congress intended the forfeiture\n\nstatute to preempt state laws governing family property\n\narrangements.15    The Supreme Court has said in another context that\n\n\n     15    State law may not permit the government, even if it were in\nthe role of a creditor of Mr. Gass, to force a sale of the property,\nsee Opinion of the Justices, 151 N.E.2d at 476 (dower rights are\nsuperior to the rights of creditors), and to evict Mrs. Gass,\nparticularly given that she was his heir at time of death under the\nwill, see M.G.L.A. ch. 189, § 13; 14C Alperin & Shubow, supra, § 22.32\n(surviving spouse may continue to occupy property with heirs or\ndevisees). Cf. 2525 LeRoy Lane, 910 F.2d at 351-52 (where guilty\nhusband and innocent wife hold property as tenants by the entirety and\nproperty has been sold, government not entitled to forfeiture at\npresent and may not even be entitled to forfeiture in the future\n\n                                -25-\n\fsuch laws may be overriden by federal courts only where \"clear and\n\nsubstantial interests of the National Government, which cannot be\n\nserved consistently with respect for such state interests [in the\n\nfield of family and family-property arrangements], will suffer major\n\ndamage if the state law is applied.\"     United States v. Yazell, 382\n\nU.S. 341, 352 (1966).   What is clear to us, for the reasons which\n\nfollow, is that the federal interests would not suffer major damage\n\nfrom applying state law or from denying forfeiture.\n\n          The two primary federal interests underlying the\n\nforfeiture statute are the protection of innocent owners and the\n\ndeterrence of drug crimes.    As to the former, courts evaluating an\n\ninnocent owner defense must consider the importance state-law-created\n\nfamily property rights like the dower interest play in the lives of\n\npeople like Mrs. Gass, who rely on them in building careers, raising\n\nfamilies, and planning for the future.     We believe that it is\n\nprecisely those interests that Congress meant to protect in creating\n\nan innocent owner defense to civil forfeiture and that here\n\nforfeiture of either the entire property or some portion of it would\n\nplainly not serve those interests.\n\n          As to the question of deterrence, we believe that no\n\ndeterrence interest would be served by allowing forfeiture of the\n\n\nregardless of timing of wife's later knowledge).   We need not decide\nthose questions.\n\n                               -26-\n\fproperty, whether it be the entire property or any portion remaining\n\nafter assigning Mrs. Gass her dower interest.   Specifically, the\n\ndeterrence interest would not be served as to people like Mrs. Gass,\n\nwho did not know about the illegal conduct until after it is over,\n\nand so would have no incentive to consent or facilitate the conduct.\n\nNor would it be served as to criminal defendants like Mr. Gass, who,\n\nby committing suicide, removed any possibility that they might enjoy,\n\neven indirectly, the fruits of their crimes.    Indeed, the transfer\n\nof the total interest in the property was accomplished here only\n\nthrough the criminal defendant's taking of his own life.\n\n         The government warns that sustaining an innocent owner\n\ndefense in these circumstances would create a major loophole in the\n\nforfeiture laws by effectively allowing a drug dealer to protect his\n\nproperty by keeping a potential transferee in the dark during the\n\ntime he engaged in the illegal activity and then transferring the\n\nproperty to that person if and when he got caught.   While this\n\nconcern is reasonable when applied to other sets of circumstances, it\n\ntends to lose force in the marital context as to property interests,\n\ncreated by law, of the spouse innocent of wrongdoing, and it is\n\nsimply misplaced when applied to the particular facts of this case.\n\nHere, claimant already had an interest in the property by operation\n\nof law before she knew that the illegal activity was occurring.\n\nMoreover, had Mr. Gass been more intent on avoiding the possible\n\n\n                             -27-\n\fconsequences of forfeiture -- had he been a more legally savvy drug\n\ndealer -- he could simply have transferred title in the property to\n\nhis wife when he began to engage in the hidden illegal activities or\n\ncreated a tenancy by the entirety.     Cf. 15621 S.W. 209th Ave., 894\n\nF.2d at 1512, 1519-20 (no forfeiture of property held in tenancy by\n\nthe entirety).   This, of course, would have given Mrs. Gass what was\n\nin some sense already legally hers under Massachusetts law.\n\n         While the new amendments to the forfeiture statute do not\n\napply to this case, the legislative history sheds light on the nature\n\nof Congress' interest in deterrence.     The legislative history to the\n\nrecent amendments to the forfeiture statute reinforces that no\n\ndeterrence interest would be served by denying the innocent owner\n\ndefense on these facts.     It expressly cites the suicide of the\n\nwrongdoer as an example of where the deterrent interest would not be\n\nserved: \"The risk of moral hazard here is slight.     It is hardly\n\nlikely that many criminals will commit suicide for the express\n\npurpose of foiling imminent seizures by having their property\n\ndevolved to their heirs.\"     H.R. Rep. No. 106-192 (1999).    Here, there\n\nis no risk that the wrongdoer would enjoy the property or get any\n\nbenefit from it, and Congress thought it unreasonable to believe that\n\nwrongdoers would commit suicide to avoid forfeiture.\n\n         In short, permitting forfeiture here would deter drug\n\ndealing only in the most Draconian sense of deterrence.       That\n\n\n                                -28-\n\fDraconian sort of deterrence underlay the ancient common law doctrine\n\nthat all of a felon's possessions were forfeited to the crown.\n\nSee Calero-Toledo v. Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., 416 U.S. 663, 682\n\n(1974) (\"[At common law the] convicted felon forfeited his chattels\n\nto the Crown and his lands escheated to his lord; the convicted\n\ntraitor forfeited all of his property, real and personal, to the\n\nCrown.\"); see also Michael Paul Austern Cohen, Note, The\n\nConstitutional Infirmity of RICO Forfeiture, 46 Wash. & Lee L. Rev.\n\n937, 959 n.2 (1989).16     But that ancient doctrine is not part of\n\n\n\n\n     16    The historical basis for common law forfeiture was that a\nbreach of the criminal law was an offense to the king's peace, which\nwas felt to justify denial of the right to own property. Calero-Toledo,\n416 U.S. at 682 (citing 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *299). In 1870,\nEngland eliminated most forfeitures of those convicted of felonies or\ntreason by statute.

The government seeks to seize the property because Kathleen Gass' late husband, William Gass, used it for his side business as a drug dealer, unbeknownst to his wife and child. Mrs. Gass first learned her husband had used the ground floor apartment for cocaine deals on the day the government arrested him and raided the property. Mr. Gass, in whose name the house stood, made out a will and left Kathleen Gass the house. Within ten days, he committed suicide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government then started forfeiture proceedings. At the close of evidence, the district court granted the government's motion for a directed verdict and denied Kathleen Gass' motion for entry of judgment. The court concluded that Kathleen Gass was not entitled to assert the \"innocent owner\" defense, see 21 U.S.C.A. &#167; 881(a)(7) (1999), since she did not possess an ownership interest in the property until after she had learned that the property had been used for drug dealing. The court also concluded that forfeiture of the property did not constitute an excessive fine under the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution. We now vacate the decision of the district court and direct dismissal of the government's forfeiture case with prejudice on the ground that claimant has satisfied the requirements of the innocent owner defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are undisputed. On February 5, 1990, William Gass purchased the property at 221 Dana Avenue, in Hyde Park, Massachusetts. The deed was issued solely in his name. Kathleen Gass has lived at the property with William Gass since 1990, and currently resides there, along with the couple's eight year old son, Cedric Gass. William and Kathleen Gass were married on January 8, 1995, but William did not convey an interest in the property to Mrs. Gass. For the past decade, Mrs. Gass has worked as an accountant for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, where she earns approximately $30,000 per year. Although she did not contribute money towards the purchase price of the home or to mortgage payments made before or during her marriage to William Gass, Kathleen Gass consistently contributed to other essential financial needs of the household, including food and clothing. Moreover, since her husband's suicide on January 29, 1998, Mrs. Gass has made the mortgage payments on the property and has made improvements to the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Gass operated a taxi cab business out of the home. The office for the business was located in a separate apartment on the first floor. The second floor served as the family home. Mrs. Gass rarely entered the first floor area, and did not even have a key to her husband's office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1997, the Drug Enforcement Agency and United States Customs Service started an investigation of William Gass for suspected cocaine distribution. In 1997, the agents, with the assistance of a confidential informant, arranged several controlled drug buys with Mr. Gass at the property. On January 8, 1998, Mr. Gass was arrested and charged with cocaine distribution. Later that day, agents executed a search warrant on the property. Mr. Gass confessed and accompanied the agents to the property, where he retrieved and turned over to agents 490 grams of cocaine and $59,000. Agents also found a white bucket and scale which had been used, according to the confidential informant, to weigh the cocaine. The search was the first time Mrs. Gass became aware of her husband's cocaine distribution activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 19, 1998, William Gass executed a will devising all of his property to his wife. On January 29, 1998, he committed suicide at the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government filed a complaint for forfeiture of the property on February 3, 1998. On February 4, 1998, the district court found that probable cause existed to believe the property was subject to forfeiture, and a monition issued.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Kathleen Gass was appointed executrix of her husband's will on June 28, 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A jury trial on the forfeiture action started on October 18, 1999. At the close of evidence, the government moved for a directed verdict pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50. Claimant Kathleen Gass moved for entry of judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 58. Over claimant's objection, the district court dismissed the jury since there were no factual disputes to resolve, and ordered additional briefing. On January 3, 2000, the court granted the government's motion for a directed verdict and denied claimant's motion for entry of judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court rejected both of claimant's central arguments: (1) that she was an \"innocent owner\" under 21 U.S.C.A. &#167; 881(a)(7) (1999); and (2) that forfeiture of the property would constitute an excessive fine in violation of the Eighth Amendment. See United States v. 221 Dana Ave., 81 F. Supp. 2d 182 (D. Mass. 2000). As to the \"innocent owner\" defense, the court held that claimant could not prevail because, although entirely unaware of the illegal activities when they were occurring, she nonetheless knew of the property's tainted character before obtaining an ownership interest in it following her husband's death. Id. at 189 (holding that claimant's knowledge is to be measured \"at the time she acquired her property interest as an heir\"). Specifically, the court concluded that claimant's spousal right to equitable distribution of marital property upon divorce did not confer an equitable or legal ownership interest independent of a divorce proceeding. See id. at 186-87. The district court also determined that Mrs. Gass had no resulting trust in the home because she did not contribute to the mortgage payments on or the purchase price of the home. See id. at 187. Additionally, the court rejected claimant's argument that her dower interest or, alternatively, her interest as an heir under her husband's will, provided a sufficient ownership interest to enable her to assert the innocent owner defense. See id. at 188-89. In reaching this conclusion, the court accepted the government's contention that to allow a claimant to avoid forfeiture simply by establishing lack of knowledge at the time illegal conduct occurred would create \"a major loophole in the forfeiture scheme,\" whereby \"[c]riminals could simply keep family and friends out of the loop, and then transfer property to them to avoid forfeiture.\" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to claimant's Eighth Amendment argument, the district court concluded that the fine was not excessive because the harshness of the forfeiture, although significant, was outweighed by, inter alia, the seriousness of her husband's offense, the lengthy sentence and fine he could have received, and the close relationship between the property and the offense. See id. at 191-92 (applying formulation of hybrid instrumentality-proportionality test set forth in United States v. Milbrand, 58 F.3d 841, 847-48 (2d Cir. 1995)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Additionally, the court rejected claimant's argument that seizing the entire property would constitute an excessive fine in a situation where the illegal activity was confined to a separate first floor apartment in the home. See 221 Dana Ave., 81 F. Supp. 2d at 192 (\"A[n] entire parcel of land may be subject to forfeiture under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 881(a)(7) even if only part of it is directly connected to drug activity.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review de novo the grant of a Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a) motion for judgment as a matter of law, using the same standards as the district court. E.g., Russo v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., 140 F.3d 6, 8 (1st Cir. 1998). The evidence and inferences drawn from the evidence are considered in the light most favorable to the non-moving party (here, the claimant), drawing all reasonable inferences in that party's favor. Id.; Collazo-Santiago v. Toyota Motor Corp., 149 F.3d 23, 26 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our principal task is to ascertain whether Congress intended the forfeiture provisions of the old civil forfeiture statute<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> to trump the \"innocent owner\" defense on these facts. The text of the statute does not address the issue; it provides only:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">that no property shall be forfeited under this paragraph, to the extent of an interest of an owner, by reason of any act or omission established by that owner to have been committed or omitted without the knowledge or consent of that owner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">21 U.S.C.A. &#167; 881(a)(7) (1999). This language does not answer a number of questions that arise, such as the nature of the ownership interests that must be held by the innocent \"owner\" and at what time the \"innocence\" of the owner (in terms of lack of \"knowledge or consent\") is to be measured.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative history also offers little guidance, although it does instruct us that \"[t]he term 'owner' should be broadly interpreted to include any person with a recognizable legal or equitable interest in the property seized.\" Joint Explanatory Statement of Titles II and III, Pub. L. No. 95-633, 95th Cong. 2d Sess. (Oct. 7, 1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 9496, 9518, 9522.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has construed these statutory terms only once. See United States v. 92 Buena Vista Ave., 507 U.S. 111 (1993) (plurality opinion). From that decision we know that: (1) the term \"owner\" is not limited to bona fide purchasers, id. at 123; (2) for purposes of the relation back doctrine, the government does not become the owner of property before forfeiture has been decreed, and someone who acquires an ownership interest after the illegal acts have occurred may therefore still assert the innocent owner defense, id. at 123-29; and (3) equitable considerations may play some role in construing the statute, id. at 130 (leaving undecided whether \"equitable doctrines may foreclose the assertion of an innocent owner defense by a party with guilty knowledge of the tainted character of the property\"); see also United States v. 10936 Oak Run Circle, 9 F.3d 74, 76 (9th Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The courts have created various doctrines over the years intended to deal with the practical considerations of how best to effectuate the twin legislative objectives behind forfeiture: the deterrence of drug activities by forfeiture of property involved and the protection of the innocent from loss of their property interests by virtue of their association with drug criminals. See United States v. 6640 S.W. 48th St., 41 F.3d 1448, 1452 (11th Cir. 1995).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The deterrence objective applies to both use of drug proceeds and use of property as an instrument for drug dealing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> As part of its deterrence objective, forfeiture is meant to prevent drug dealers from benefitting from their crimes by putting their profits from drug activities in other hands and also to discourage those associated with drug dealers from facilitating or even consenting to such crimes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The courts of appeals, including this court, have generally agreed that state law provides the source of the property interests that determine the applicability of the innocent owner defense to federal forfeiture complaints. See, e.g., United States v. U.S. Currency, $81,000.00, 189 F.3d 28, 33 (1st Cir. 1999); United States v. One 1973 Rolls Royce, 43 F.3d 794, 805 n. 8 (3rd Cir. 1994); United States v. 1977 Porsche Carrera 911, 946 F.2d 30, 34 (5th Cir. 1991); United States v. 2525 LeRoy Lane, 910 F.2d 343, 347 (6th Cir. 1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agreement of the courts of appeals ends, however, when another issue is reached. It is the resolution of that issue which the government argues should provide the rule of decision for this case. The issue is whether the court should look to the claimant's knowledge at the time of property transfer, or, instead, to his or her knowledge at the time of commission of the illegal acts. The government says that the majority rule is that the claimant's knowledge at the time of transfer governs. The rationale is that the alternative rule, which would look to a claimant's knowledge at the time of the illegal acts, would eviscerate the forfeiture statute by allowing criminals to protect their otherwise forfeitable property interests by simply transferring them to a relative or a friend. The rule the government proposes has been applied, for example, by the Eleventh Circuit in 6640 S.W. 48th St., supra. There, the court held that if a transferee knows about illegal activity that would make the property subject to forfeiture at the time he takes his property interest, he cannot assert an innocent owner defense. See 41 F.3d at 1453; see also 10936 Oak Run Circle, 9 F.3d at 76 (\"[T]he statute bars an owner with knowledge of the origin of the property in drug proceeds from asserting 'the innocent owner defense.'\"); United States v. 352 Northup St., 40 F. Supp. 2d 74, 81-82 (D.R.I. 1999) (rejecting innocent owner defense where court disbelieved father's testimony that he knew nothing of his son's narcotics trafficking, which provided the funds to purchase the property); United States v. 3 Parcels in La Plata County, Colo., 919 F. Supp. 1449, 1458 (D. Nev. 1995) (claimant must \"show the absence of any guilty knowledge with respect to the use of the property or the source of the funds with which it had been purchased\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government would apply this rule here to say that claimant cannot be an innocent owner because she knew of her husband's crimes at the time she took title, which, at the earliest, was not until her husband's death. See Lonstein v. Rockman, 950 F.2d 77, 80 (1st Cir. 1991) (title vests upon allowance of the will by the probate court, but \"the passing of title is deemed to have related back to the date of the testator's death\"); Shrewsbury v. Murphy, 130 N.E.2d 559, 560 (Mass. 1955) (real property passes directly to the heirs upon the decedent's death).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One circuit, the government acknowledges, does not follow such a rule.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Specifically, the Third Circuit has held that the innocent owner defense is available to a claimant who shows that he or she did not own the property at the time of the drug transaction, and was not therefore in a position to consent to its use to facilitate drug crimes. See One 1973 Rolls Royce, 43 F.3d at 819; see also United States v. 1993 Bentley Coupe, 986 F. Supp. 893, 897-98 (D.N.J. 1998) (applying One 1973 Rolls Royce).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The government urges that we adopt the first rule and reject the rule adopted by the Third Circuit, as the Eleventh Circuit has done.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's interest in having bright-line tests for forfeiture is certainly legitimate. Such tests are easy to administer. They are more predictable and hence provide clearer notice. It may be that common situations can be governed by bright-line tests. But the tests cannot be unmoored from the settings to which they are applied, and no single rule can adequately cover all situations. More fundamentally, such tests must aim to carry out the dual purposes of Congress in enacting the forfeiture statute: the deterrence of drug crimes and the protection of innocent owners. Although Congress's purposes are somewhat at odds with each other, we do not view the issue before us in quite the same terms as the government -- that is, as posing a choice between a Scylla and a Charybdis, threatening to do harm to one of Congress's purposes or the other. To the contrary, we see no congressional purpose furthered by rejecting claimant's innocent owner defense on these facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's argument here has several problems. Most importantly, it skips past the fact that, under Massachusetts law, claimant had a partial interest in the property, the marital home, at the time of the illegal activity, and that interest existed long before she knew that her husband was dealing drugs. Thus, as to those interests, we need not reach the broader question of whether, under other circumstances, the innocent owner defense may be asserted by a post-illegal-act transferee with post-illegal-act knowledge -- that is, by a claimant who knew about the illegal activities when he or she acquired the property interest, but who did not know about those activities when they were occurring. Rather, because the claimant in this case had a partial interest in the property prior to learning about the illegal activities, and because the congressional purpose of deterring drug crimes would not be served by forfeiture, we conclude that she may assert the innocent owner defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the uncontroverted fact that claimant knew nothing of her husband's drug dealing while it was going on. She learned of it only after his arrest, and there was no further illegal activity thereafter. She thus clearly satisfies the \"innocence\" prong of the innocent owner defense, at least as of the time before the arrest. The question then is whether she had a sufficient interest in the property at this time to also qualify as an \"owner\" as to that interest. We think the answer is yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claimant had a type of property interest created by Massachusetts in an effort to protect a spouse's interest in marital property in the event the marriage ends, whether by death or by divorce. In the case of a spouse's death, Massachusetts recognizes several protected interests, including the dower interest, whereby a surviving spouse receives a life estate in one third of all real property owned by the deceased spouse at the time of death. See M.G.L.A. ch. 189, &#167; 1.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The Commonwealth also protects surviving spouses against being intentionally or inadvertently disinherited under the deceased spouse's will by allowing the surviving spouse to waive the will and take a share of the decedent spouse's estate as prescribed by the elective share statute; if the deceased statute left issue, the surviving spouse may waive the will and elect to receive at least one third of all real and personal property. See id. ch. 191, &#167; 15; 14C Alperin &amp; Shubow, Massachusetts Practice &#167; 22.31 (3d ed. 1996). In situations where a spouse died intestate, Massachusetts' statute of descent and distribution provides that the surviving spouse is entitled to inherit varying shares of the deceased spouse's estate depending on whether the deceased spouse is also survived by issue or kindred; if the deceased spouse left issue, that surviving spouse takes one half of the personal and real property outright. See M.G.L.A. ch. 190, &#167; 1; 14A Alperin &amp; Shubow, supra, &#167; 11.24.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Here, claimant's dower interest amounted to a life estate in one third of the property located at 221 Dana Avenue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that Massachusetts law describes these dower interests during marriage as \"inchoate,\" Opinion of the Justices, 151 N.E.2d 475, 476-78, 480 (Mass. 1958), and, as the district court accurately noted, they are not full ownership interests, see 221 Dana Ave., 81 F. Supp. 2d at 188-89 (discussing dower rights). The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has nonetheless described the dower interest as \"something more than a possibility, and as an interest in property, which equity will under some circumstances protect at the suit of the wife in the lifetime of the husband.\" Opinion of the Justices, 151 N.E.2d at 478; see also Davis v. Wetherell, 95 Mass. 60, 1866 WL 4942, at *2 (1866) (\"[A wife's] inchoate right of dower is a right of a very peculiar nature. It is a right of which nothing but her death or voluntary act can deprive her, and so it is something more than a mere possibility.\"). Moreover, under traditional dower rights doctrine, Mr. Gass lacked the power, acting without claimant's consent, to encumber or sell her dower interest. See Opinion of the Justices, 151 N.E.2d at 476-78; see also Taylor v. Gowetz, 158 N.E.2d 677, 680 (Mass. 1959) (discussing agreement whereby wife released, inter alia, dower rights); Mathews v.

The right of dower is superior to any claims of creditors on the estate of the deceased. See Opinion of the Justices, 151 N.E.2d at 476; 21 Dunphy, supra, &#167; 7.1, at 96.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the event of divorce, although a spouse loses the dower interest, see M.G.L.A. ch. 208, &#167; 27, Massachusetts law, in a sense, compensates by providing for an equitable distribution of marital property, see id. ch. 208, &#167; 34 (\"In addition to or in lieu of a judgment to pay alimony, the court may assign to either husband or wife all or any part of the estate of the other . . . . In fixing the nature and value of the property to be so assigned, the court . . . . may also consider the contribution of each of the parties in the acquisition, preservation or appreciation in value of their respective estates and the contribution of each of the parties as a homemaker to the family unit.\"); Williams v. Massa, 728 N.E.2d 932, 943 (Mass. 2000) (\"The parties' respective contributions to the marital partnership remain the touchstone of an equitable division of the marital estate.\") (internal quotation marks omitted); Heins v. Ledis, 664 N.E.2d 10, 15 (Mass. 1996) (\"Alimony is an award for support and maintenance and has historically been based on the common law duty of the husband to support his wife. Property division, on the other hand, is based on the joint contribution of the spouses to the marital enterprise.\") (internal quotation marks omitted). Although the interest of a divorced spouse is not involved in this case, Massachusetts's equitable distribution statute further demonstrates the coherence and consistency of the Commonwealth's scheme of protecting spouses, including a spouse's interest in the real property owned separately by the other spouse. See generally, e.g., 14A Alperin &amp; Shubow, supra, &#167; 11.1 (\"Although formed by contract, marriage creates a status from which arise automatically property rights of support, dower, and a share in the estate of a deceased spouse.\") (internal footnotes omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As it turned out, claimant's husband made a will leaving her all his property. However, this simply had the effect of giving her the interest in intestacy that her child would have held had her husband not made the will. See M.G.L.A. ch. 190, &#167; 1. It also had the effect of removing any reason for claimant to timely file her election and claim of her dower interest in the property to avoid waiver, see id. ch. 189, &#167; 1, the property having been bequeathed to her in its entirety.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Thus, we disagree with the district court's conclusion that because claimant did not act to preserve her dower rights, she lost any effect those rights might have had on the question of whether she had a sufficient ownership interest in the property. See 221 Dana Ave., 81 F. Supp. 2d at 188.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that the Tenth Circuit in United States v. 9844 South Titan Court, 75 F.3d 1470 (10th Cir. 1996), held that where a spouse has only an inchoate interest in marital property, that interest does not amount to an ownership interest for purposes of asserting an innocent owner defense. See id. at 1477-78. The case is distinguishable because Colorado law, there the relevant state law, differs from Massachusetts law as to the nature of the inchoate interest. Indeed, Colorado appears to adhere to a doctrine that Massachusetts explicitly rejected in Opinion of the Justices, supra, where the SJC distinguished other jurisdictions' doctrine that inchoate rights are \"not an interest in property, but a mere possibility, created by law, and not in any sense vested or assignable until after the husband's death.\" 151 N.E.2d at 477-78. Nor did the Tenth Circuit consider the argument, advanced by claimant here, that an interest in property for purposes of sustaining the innocent owner defense arises from a spouse's dower interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, given the special protection accorded the claimant's dower interest under Massachusetts law, we think the claimant had a sufficient ownership interest in the property prior to her learning about her husband's illegal activities to allow her to maintain an innocent owner defense as to that interest. See United States v. 116 Emerson Street, 942 F.2d 74, 79-80 (1st Cir. 1991) (recognizing wife's ownership interest in property in forfeiture action by way of a resulting trust, whereby wife and husband had agreed that he would pay downpayment, she would make mortgage payments in the same amount, and both would take an interest in the home); United States v. 15621 S.W. 209th Ave., 894 F.2d 1511, 1516 (11th Cir. 1990) (using Florida law to determine the property interests and determining that no interest exists that can presently be forfeited to the government in property held in tenancy by the entirety); United States v. East Half Section 12, 131 F.R.D. 171, 174 (D. Neb. 1990) (state statute giving a surviving spouse \"the right to take a share of a deceased spouse's real estate, in lieu of what he or she may receive under a will\" creates a property interest for purposes of the federal forfeiture statute).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> At a minimum, that ownership interest is her dower interest in one third of the property.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> This raises the question of any remaining interests in the property. See 21 U.S.C.A. &#167; 881(a)(7) (1999) (innocent owner protected from forfeiture \"to the extent of the [ownership] interest\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not know whether the government, if it had recognized that Mrs. Gass was an innocent owner of a one third interest, would have exercised its prosecutorial discretion to attempt to forfeit any arguable remaining interest. In fact, the government's forfeiture papers claim only an interest in the entire property, not a lesser interest. We have little reason to assume the government would have done so, given the equities of the situation. But assuming arguendo the government intends the present action to reach any remaining interests, such effort fails because forfeiture would not, on these facts, serve any congressional purpose behind the forfeiture statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is far from clear that Congress intended the forfeiture statute to preempt state laws governing family property arrangements.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> The Supreme Court has said in another context that such laws may be overriden by federal courts only where \"clear and substantial interests of the National Government, which cannot be served consistently with respect for such state interests [in the field of family and family-property arrangements], will suffer major damage if the state law is applied.\" United States v. Yazell, 382 U.S. 341, 352 (1966). What is clear to us, for the reasons which follow, is that the federal interests would not suffer major damage from applying state law or from denying forfeiture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two primary federal interests underlying the forfeiture statute are the protection of innocent owners and the deterrence of drug crimes. As to the former, courts evaluating an innocent owner defense must consider the importance state-law-created family property rights like the dower interest play in the lives of people like Mrs. Gass, who rely on them in building careers, raising families, and planning for the future. We believe that it is precisely those interests that Congress meant to protect in creating an innocent owner defense to civil forfeiture and that here forfeiture of either the entire property or some portion of it would plainly not serve those interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the question of deterrence, we believe that no deterrence interest would be served by allowing forfeiture of the property, whether it be the entire property or any portion remaining after assigning Mrs. Gass her dower interest. Specifically, the deterrence interest would not be served as to people like Mrs. Gass, who did not know about the illegal conduct until after it is over, and so would have no incentive to consent or facilitate the conduct. Nor would it be served as to criminal defendants like Mr. Gass, who, by committing suicide, removed any possibility that they might enjoy, even indirectly, the fruits of their crimes. Indeed, the transfer of the total interest in the property was accomplished here only through the criminal defendant's taking of his own life.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government warns that sustaining an innocent owner defense in these circumstances would create a major loophole in the forfeiture laws by effectively allowing a drug dealer to protect his property by keeping a potential transferee in the dark during the time he engaged in the illegal activity and then transferring the property to that person if and when he got caught. While this concern is reasonable when applied to other sets of circumstances, it tends to lose force in the marital context as to property interests, created by law, of the spouse innocent of wrongdoing, and it is simply misplaced when applied to the particular facts of this case. Here, claimant already had an interest in the property by operation of law before she knew that the illegal activity was occurring. Moreover, had Mr. Gass been more intent on avoiding the possible consequences of forfeiture -- had he been a more legally savvy drug dealer -- he could simply have transferred title in the property to his wife when he began to engage in the hidden illegal activities or created a tenancy by the entirety. Cf. 15621 S.W. 209th Ave., 894 F.2d at 1512, 1519-20 (no forfeiture of property held in tenancy by the entirety). This, of course, would have given Mrs. Gass what was in some sense already legally hers under Massachusetts law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the new amendments to the forfeiture statute do not apply to this case, the legislative history sheds light on the nature of Congress' interest in deterrence. The legislative history to the recent amendments to the forfeiture statute reinforces that no deterrence interest would be served by denying the innocent owner defense on these facts. It expressly cites the suicide of the wrongdoer as an example of where the deterrent interest would not be served: \"The risk of moral hazard here is slight. It is hardly likely that many criminals will commit suicide for the express purpose of foiling imminent seizures by having their property devolved to their heirs.\" H.R. Rep. No. 106-192 (1999). Here, there is no risk that the wrongdoer would enjoy the property or get any benefit from it, and Congress thought it unreasonable to believe that wrongdoers would commit suicide to avoid forfeiture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, permitting forfeiture here would deter drug dealing only in the most Draconian sense of deterrence. That Draconian sort of deterrence underlay the ancient common law doctrine that all of a felon's possessions were forfeited to the crown. See Calero-Toledo v. Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., 416 U.S. 663, 682 (1974) (\"[At common law the] convicted felon forfeited his chattels to the Crown and his lands escheated to his lord; the convicted traitor forfeited all of his property, real and personal, to the Crown.\"); see also Michael Paul Austern Cohen, Note, The Constitutional Infirmity of RICO Forfeiture, 46 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 937, 959 n.2 (1989).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> But that ancient doctrine is not part of American law,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> and we are loath to attribute such an extreme view to a Congress that simultaneously wanted to protect innocent owners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, on the particular facts of this case, we hold that claimant has established an innocent owner defense as to the property at 221 Dana Avenue. Our holding is dependent on the combination of the following factors: claimant was innocent with respect to the illegal activities when they occurred and learned of those activities only upon the arrest of her husband, the criminal defendant; claimant had a partial interest in the property by operation of state law while she was undisputedly innocent of any knowledge of wrongdoing; an entire interest in the property passed to her only on the suicide of her husband; and the congressional purpose of deterring drug dealing would not be served by forfeiture in light of all the relevant circumstances. The parties have agreed that there were no material facts in dispute, so there is little point in remanding this case for further fact finding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we vacate the decision of the district court and direct dismissal of the government's forfeiture action with prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In a civil forfeiture case, the government must first establish probable cause to believe that a nexus existed between the property and specified illegal activity sufficient to justify forfeiture. This shifts the burden to the claimant, who must refute the government's prima facie case either (1) by demonstrating that the property was not in fact used for the specified illegal activity or (2) by proving that she (the claimant) did not know about or consent to the illicit activity. See, e.g., United States v. 15 Bosworth St., 236 F.3d 110, 116 n.7 (1st Cir. 2001); United States v. Cunan, 156 F.3d 110, 116 n.7 (1st Cir. 1998) (internal citations omitted).

Forfeiture of the proceeds of illegal drug transactions was initially limited to all moneys, negotiable instruments, securities, and other things of value furnished by any person in exchange for a controlled substance, and all proceeds traceable to the exchange. See Psychotropic Substances Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-633, 92 Stat. 3768, 3777. In 1984, Congress enacted section 306(a) of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act, which further expanded civil forfeiture to reach all real property used in violation of the statute. See Pub. L.

See 507 U.S. at 139 (Scalia, J., concurring) (\"I do not find inconceivable the possibility that post-illegal-act transferees with post-illegal-act knowledge of the earlier illegality are provided a defense against forfeiture.

See 886 F.2d at 626. Specifically, the court read in the disjunctive the language in 21 U.S.C. &#167; 881(a)(7) barring forfeiture if the claimant could show lack of knowledge or consent. It therefore allowed the claimant to show either one or the other, as opposed to requiring that he show both. See id. In One 1973 Rolls Royce, the Third Circuit held that the 6109 Grubb Road analysis applied equally to pre-illegal-act owners (the situation in 6109 Grubb Road) and post-illegal act owners (the situation in One 1973 Rolls Royce). See 43 F.3d at 819 (\"if [claimant] can show that he did not know that the [property] was being used or going to be used [in connection with the illegal transactions] at the time they took place, then he will be able to show that he did not consent to the use and, under 6109 Grubb Road, will be entitled to the innocent owner defense\"). Here, however, neither party has argued that the issue turns on whether we read &#167; 881(a)(7)'s reference to \"knowledge or consent\" in the conjunctive or disjunctive, and therefore we do not reach that issue.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Formerly, a husband received a life estate in one third of all land owned by the wife upon her death, known as tenancy by curtesy, while the wife received a life estate in one third of all land owned by her husband upon his death, known as tenancy by dower. The distinction between curtesy and dower has been eliminated, and dower has been made available to either spouse. See M.G.L.A. ch. 305, &#167; 1A (1978); 21 Dunphy, Massachusetts Practice &#167; 7.1, at 95 (2d ed. 1997).</p>\n        <p>The common law property concept of dower developed during the middle ages in England, when land was the main source of wealth and the basis of an agrarian society. Under the system of femme covert, husband and wife merged into a single legal identity, and all of a woman's property and earnings belonged to her husband. In return for relinquishing control over all of her property, the law of dower required that the husband provide his wife with support and maintenance, especially during her widowhood. Dower rights, which attached to the land at the moment of marriage, generally allowed a wife a one third share in a life estate in all freehold land that the husband owned during the marriage and that was inheritable by the legal heirs of the husband and wife. See Kathleen M. O'Connor, Note, Marital Property Reform in Massachusetts: A Choice for the New Millennium, 34 New. Eng. L. Rev. 261, 272-75 (1999). During the nineteenth century, Massachusetts, like other states, passed married women's property acts which gave wives greater rights over property and earnings, including the right to keep and manage as their own property that they had brought to or acquired after the marriage by gift, inheritance, bequest, or devise.

The government seeks to seize the property because Kathleen Gass' late husband, William Gass, used it for his side business as a drug dealer, unbeknownst to his wife and child. Mrs. Gass first learned her husband had used the ground floor apartment for cocaine deals on the day the government arrested him and raided the property. Mr. Gass, in whose name the house stood, made out a will and left Kathleen Gass the house. Within ten days, he committed suicide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government then started forfeiture proceedings. At the close of evidence, the district court granted the government's motion for a directed verdict and denied Kathleen Gass' motion for entry of judgment. The court concluded that Kathleen Gass was not entitled to assert the \"innocent owner\" defense, see 21 U.S.C.A. &#167; 881(a)(7) (1999), since she did not possess an ownership interest in the property until after she had learned that the property had been used for drug dealing. The court also concluded that forfeiture of the property did not constitute an excessive fine under the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution. We now vacate the decision of the district court and direct dismissal of the government's forfeiture case with prejudice on the ground that claimant has satisfied the requirements of the innocent owner defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are undisputed. On February 5, 1990, William Gass purchased the property at 221 Dana Avenue, in Hyde Park, Massachusetts. The deed was issued solely in his name. Kathleen Gass has lived at the property with William Gass since 1990, and currently resides there, along with the couple's eight year old son, Cedric Gass. William and Kathleen Gass were married on January 8, 1995, but William did not convey an interest in the property to Mrs. Gass. For the past decade, Mrs. Gass has worked as an accountant for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, where she earns approximately $30,000 per year. Although she did not contribute money towards the purchase price of the home or to mortgage payments made before or during her marriage to William Gass, Kathleen Gass consistently contributed to other essential financial needs of the household, including food and clothing. Moreover, since her husband's suicide on January 29, 1998, Mrs. Gass has made the mortgage payments on the property and has made improvements to the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Gass operated a taxi cab business out of the home. The office for the business was located in a separate apartment on the first floor. The second floor served as the family home. Mrs. Gass rarely entered the first floor area, and did not even have a key to her husband's office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1997, the Drug Enforcement Agency and United States Customs Service started an investigation of William Gass for suspected cocaine distribution. In 1997, the agents, with the assistance of a confidential informant, arranged several controlled drug buys with Mr. Gass at the property. On January 8, 1998, Mr. Gass was arrested and charged with cocaine distribution. Later that day, agents executed a search warrant on the property. Mr. Gass confessed and accompanied the agents to the property, where he retrieved and turned over to agents 490 grams of cocaine and $59,000. Agents also found a white bucket and scale which had been used, according to the confidential informant, to weigh the cocaine. The search was the first time Mrs. Gass became aware of her husband's cocaine distribution activities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 19, 1998, William Gass executed a will devising all of his property to his wife.

On February 4, 1998, the district court found that probable cause existed to believe the property was subject to forfeiture, and a monition issued.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Kathleen Gass was appointed executrix of her husband's will on June 28, 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A jury trial on the forfeiture action started on October 18, 1999. At the close of evidence, the government moved for a directed verdict pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50. Claimant Kathleen Gass moved for entry of judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 58. Over claimant's objection, the district court dismissed the jury since there were no factual disputes to resolve, and ordered additional briefing. On January 3, 2000, the court granted the government's motion for a directed verdict and denied claimant's motion for entry of judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court rejected both of claimant's central arguments: (1) that she was an \"innocent owner\" under 21 U.S.C.A. &#167; 881(a)(7) (1999); and (2) that forfeiture of the property would constitute an excessive fine in violation of the Eighth Amendment. See United States v. 221 Dana Ave., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2420881\"><a href=\"/opinion/2420881/united-states-v-real-property-221-dana-avenue/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">182</span></a></span> (D. Mass. 2000). As to the \"innocent owner\" defense, the court held that claimant could not prevail because, although entirely unaware of the illegal activities when they were occurring, she nonetheless knew of the property's tainted character before obtaining an ownership interest in it following her husband's death. Id. at 189 (holding that claimant's knowledge is to be measured \"at the time she acquired her property interest as an heir\"). Specifically, the court concluded that claimant's spousal right to equitable distribution of marital property upon divorce did not confer an equitable or legal ownership interest independent of a divorce proceeding. See id. at 186-87. The district court also determined that Mrs. Gass had no resulting trust in the home because she did not contribute to the mortgage payments on or the purchase price of the home. See id. at 187. Additionally, the court rejected claimant's argument that her dower interest or, alternatively, her interest as an heir under her husband's will, provided a sufficient ownership interest to enable her to assert the innocent owner defense. See id. at 188-89. In reaching this conclusion, the court accepted the government's contention that to allow a claimant to avoid forfeiture simply by establishing lack of knowledge at the time illegal conduct occurred would create \"a major loophole in the forfeiture scheme,\" whereby \"[c]riminals could simply keep family and friends out of the loop, and then transfer property to them to avoid forfeiture.\" Id.

See id. at 191-92 (applying formulation of hybrid instrumentality-proportionality test set forth in United States v.

It is the resolution of that issue which the government argues should provide the rule of decision for this case. The issue is whether the court should look to the claimant's knowledge at the time of property transfer, or, instead, to his or her knowledge at the time of commission of the illegal acts. The government says that the majority rule is that the claimant's knowledge at the time of transfer governs. The rationale is that the alternative rule, which would look to a claimant's knowledge at the time of the illegal acts, would eviscerate the forfeiture statute by allowing criminals to protect their otherwise forfeitable property interests by simply transferring them to a relative or a friend. The rule the government proposes has been applied, for example, by the Eleventh Circuit in <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">6640</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">48th</span></span> St., supra.

Such tests are easy to administer. They are more predictable and hence provide clearer notice. It may be that common situations can be governed by bright-line tests. But the tests cannot be unmoored from the settings to which they are applied, and no single rule can adequately cover all situations. More fundamentally, such tests must aim to carry out the dual purposes of Congress in enacting the forfeiture statute: the deterrence of drug crimes and the protection of innocent owners. Although Congress's purposes are somewhat at odds with each other, we do not view the issue before us in quite the same terms as the government -- that is, as posing a choice between a Scylla and a Charybdis, threatening to do harm to one of Congress's purposes or the other. To the contrary, we see no congressional purpose furthered by rejecting claimant's innocent owner defense on these facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's argument here has several problems. Most importantly, it skips past the fact that, under Massachusetts law, claimant had a partial interest in the property, the marital home, at the time of the illegal activity, and that interest existed long before she knew that her husband was dealing drugs. Thus, as to those interests, we need not reach the broader question of whether, under other circumstances, the innocent owner defense may be asserted by a post-illegal-act transferee with post-illegal-act knowledge -- that is, by a claimant who knew about the illegal activities when he or she acquired the property interest, but who did not know about those activities when they were occurring. Rather, because the claimant in this case had a partial interest in the property prior to learning about the illegal activities, and because the congressional purpose of deterring drug crimes would not be served by forfeiture, we conclude that she may assert the innocent owner defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the uncontroverted fact that claimant knew nothing of her husband's drug dealing while it was going on. She learned of it only after his arrest, and there was no further illegal activity thereafter. She thus clearly satisfies the \"innocence\" prong of the innocent owner defense, at least as of the time before the arrest. The question then is whether she had a sufficient interest in the property at this time to also qualify as an \"owner\" as to that interest. We think the answer is yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claimant had a type of property interest created by Massachusetts in an effort to protect a spouse's interest in marital property in the event the marriage ends, whether by death or by divorce. In the case of a spouse's death, Massachusetts recognizes several protected interests, including the dower interest, whereby a surviving spouse receives a life estate in one third of all real property owned by the deceased spouse at the time of death. See M.G.L.A. ch. 189, &#167; 1.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The Commonwealth also protects surviving spouses against being intentionally or inadvertently disinherited under the deceased spouse's will by allowing the surviving spouse to waive the will and take a share of the decedent spouse's estate as prescribed by the elective share statute; if the deceased statute left issue, the surviving spouse may waive the will and elect to receive at least one third of all real and personal property. See id. ch. 191, &#167; 15; 14C Alperin &amp; Shubow, Massachusetts Practice &#167; 22.31 (3d ed. 1996). In situations where a spouse died intestate, Massachusetts' statute of descent and distribution provides that the surviving spouse is entitled to inherit varying shares of the deceased spouse's estate depending on whether the deceased spouse is also survived by issue or kindred; if the deceased spouse left issue, that surviving spouse takes one half of the personal and real property outright. See M.G.L.A. ch. 190, &#167; 1; 14A Alperin &amp; Shubow, supra, &#167; 11.24.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Here, claimant's dower interest amounted to a life estate in one third of the property located at 221 Dana Avenue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that Massachusetts law describes these dower interests during marriage as \"inchoate,\" Opinion of the Justices, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">151</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">475</span></span>, 476-78, 480 (Mass. 1958), and, as the district court accurately noted, they are not full ownership interests, see 221 Dana Ave., 81 F.

In fixing the nature and value of the property to be so assigned, the court . . . . may also consider the contribution of each of the parties in the acquisition, preservation or appreciation in value of their respective estates and the contribution of each of the parties as a homemaker to the family unit.\"); Williams v.

Property division, on the other hand, is based on the joint contribution of the spouses to the marital enterprise.\") (internal quotation marks omitted). Although the interest of a divorced spouse is not involved in this case, Massachusetts's equitable distribution statute further demonstrates the coherence and consistency of the Commonwealth's scheme of protecting spouses, including a spouse's interest in the real property owned separately by the other spouse. See generally, e.g., 14A Alperin &amp; Shubow, supra, &#167; 11.1 (\"Although formed by contract, marriage creates a status from which arise automatically property rights of support, dower, and a share in the estate of a deceased spouse.\") (internal footnotes omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As it turned out, claimant's husband made a will leaving her all his property. However, this simply had the effect of giving her the interest in intestacy that her child would have held had her husband not made the will. See M.G.L.A. ch. 190, &#167; 1. It also had the effect of removing any reason for claimant to timely file her election and claim of her dower interest in the property to avoid waiver, see id. ch. 189, &#167; 1, the property having been bequeathed to her in its entirety.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Thus, we disagree with the district court's conclusion that because claimant did not act to preserve her dower rights, she lost any effect those rights might have had on the question of whether she had a sufficient ownership interest in the property. See 221 Dana Ave., 81 F. Supp. 2d at 188.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that the Tenth Circuit in United States v. 9844 South Titan Court, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"712236\"><a href=\"/opinion/712236/nos-94-1285-94-1290/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1470</span></a></span> (10th Cir. 1996), held that where a spouse has only an inchoate interest in marital property, that interest does not amount to an ownership interest for purposes of asserting an innocent owner defense. See id. at 1477-78. The case is distinguishable because Colorado law, there the relevant state law, differs from Massachusetts law as to the nature of the inchoate interest. Indeed, Colorado appears to adhere to a doctrine that Massachusetts explicitly rejected in Opinion of the Justices, supra, where the SJC distinguished other jurisdictions' doctrine that inchoate rights are \"not an interest in property, but a mere possibility, created by law, and not in any sense vested or assignable until after the husband's death.\" 151 N.E.2d at 477-78. Nor did the Tenth Circuit consider the argument, advanced by claimant here, that an interest in property for purposes of sustaining the innocent owner defense arises from a spouse's dower interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, given the special protection accorded the claimant's dower interest under Massachusetts law, we think the claimant had a sufficient ownership interest in the property prior to her learning about her husband's illegal activities to allow her to maintain an innocent owner defense as to that interest. See United States v. 116 Emerson Street, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566802\"><a href=\"/opinion/566802/united-states-v-one-parcel-of-real-property-with-buildings-appurtenances/\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span>, 79-80 (1st Cir. 1991) (recognizing wife's ownership interest in property in forfeiture action by way of a resulting trust, whereby wife and husband had agreed that he would pay downpayment, she would make mortgage payments in the same amount, and both would take an interest in the home); United States v. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">15621</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">209th</span></span> Ave., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536018\"><a href=\"/opinion/536018/no-88-5861/\"><span class=\"volume\">894</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1511</span></a></span>, 1516 (11th Cir. 1990) (using Florida law to determine the property interests and determining that no interest exists that can presently be forfeited to the government in property held in tenancy by the entirety); United States v.

See 21 U.S.C.A. &#167; 881(a)(7) (1999) (innocent owner protected from forfeiture \"to the extent of the [ownership] interest\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not know whether the government, if it had recognized that Mrs. Gass was an innocent owner of a one third interest, would have exercised its prosecutorial discretion to attempt to forfeit any arguable remaining interest. In fact, the government's forfeiture papers claim only an interest in the entire property, not a lesser interest. We have little reason to assume the government would have done so, given the equities of the situation. But assuming arguendo the government intends the present action to reach any remaining interests, such effort fails because forfeiture would not, on these facts, serve any congressional purpose behind the forfeiture statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is far from clear that Congress intended the forfeiture statute to preempt state laws governing family property arrangements.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> The Supreme Court has said in another context that such laws may be overriden by federal courts only where \"clear and substantial interests of the National Government, which cannot be served consistently with respect for such state interests [in the field of family and family-property arrangements], will suffer major damage if the state law is applied.\" United States v. Yazell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107139\"><a href=\"/opinion/107139/united-states-v-yazell/\"><span class=\"volume\">382</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></a></span>, 352 (1966). What is clear to us, for the reasons which follow, is that the federal interests would not suffer major damage from applying state law or from denying forfeiture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two primary federal interests underlying the forfeiture statute are the protection of innocent owners and the deterrence of drug crimes. As to the former, courts evaluating an innocent owner defense must consider the importance state-law-created family property rights like the dower interest play in the lives of people like Mrs. Gass, who rely on them in building careers, raising families, and planning for the future. We believe that it is precisely those interests that Congress meant to protect in creating an innocent owner defense to civil forfeiture and that here forfeiture of either the entire property or some portion of it would plainly not serve those interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the question of deterrence, we believe that no deterrence interest would be served by allowing forfeiture of the property, whether it be the entire property or any portion remaining after assigning Mrs. Gass her dower interest. Specifically, the deterrence interest would not be served as to people like Mrs. Gass, who did not know about the illegal conduct until after it is over, and so would have no incentive to consent or facilitate the conduct. Nor would it be served as to criminal defendants like Mr. Gass, who, by committing suicide, removed any possibility that they might enjoy, even indirectly, the fruits of their crimes. Indeed, the transfer of the total interest in the property was accomplished here only through the criminal defendant's taking of his own life.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government warns that sustaining an innocent owner defense in these circumstances would create a major loophole in the forfeiture laws by effectively allowing a drug dealer to protect his property by keeping a potential transferee in the dark during the time he engaged in the illegal activity and then transferring the property to that person if and when he got caught. While this concern is reasonable when applied to other sets of circumstances, it tends to lose force in the marital context as to property interests, created by law, of the spouse innocent of wrongdoing, and it is simply misplaced when applied to the particular facts of this case. Here, claimant already had an interest in the property by operation of law before she knew that the illegal activity was occurring. Moreover, had Mr. Gass been more intent on avoiding the possible consequences of forfeiture -- had he been a more legally savvy drug dealer -- he could simply have transferred title in the property to his wife when he began to engage in the hidden illegal activities or created a tenancy by the entirety. Cf. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">15621</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">209th</span></span> Ave., 894 F.2d at 1512, 1519-20 (no forfeiture of property held in tenancy by the entirety). This, of course, would have given Mrs. Gass what was in some sense already legally hers under Massachusetts law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the new amendments to the forfeiture statute do not apply to this case, the legislative history sheds light on the nature of Congress' interest in deterrence. The legislative history to the recent amendments to the forfeiture statute reinforces that no deterrence interest would be served by denying the innocent owner defense on these facts. It expressly cites the suicide of the wrongdoer as an example of where the deterrent interest would not be served: \"The risk of moral hazard here is slight. It is hardly likely that many criminals will commit suicide for the express purpose of foiling imminent seizures by having their property devolved to their heirs.\" H.R. Rep. No. 106-192 (1999). Here, there is no risk that the wrongdoer would enjoy the property or get any benefit from it, and Congress thought it unreasonable to believe that wrongdoers would commit suicide to avoid forfeiture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, permitting forfeiture here would deter drug dealing only in the most Draconian sense of deterrence. That Draconian sort of deterrence underlay the ancient common law doctrine that all of a felon's possessions were forfeited to the crown. See Calero-Toledo v. Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109026\"><a href=\"/opinion/109026/calero-toledo-v-pearson-yacht-leasing-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">663</span></a></span>, 682 (1974) (\"[At common law the] convicted felon forfeited his chattels to the Crown and his lands escheated to his lord; the convicted traitor forfeited all of his property, real and personal, to the Crown.\"); see also Michael Paul Austern Cohen, Note, The Constitutional Infirmity of RICO Forfeiture, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></span>&amp; Lee L. Rev. 937, 959 n.2 (1989).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> But that ancient doctrine is not part of American law,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> and we are loath to attribute such an extreme view to a Congress that simultaneously wanted to protect innocent owners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, on the particular facts of this case, we hold that claimant has established an innocent owner defense as to the property at 221 Dana Avenue. Our holding is dependent on the combination of the following factors: claimant was innocent with respect to the illegal activities when they occurred and learned of those activities only upon the arrest of her husband, the criminal defendant; claimant had a partial interest in the property by operation of state law while she was undisputedly innocent of any knowledge of wrongdoing; an entire interest in the property passed to her only on the suicide of her husband; and the congressional purpose of deterring drug dealing would not be served by forfeiture in light of all the relevant circumstances. The parties have agreed that there were no material facts in dispute, so there is little point in remanding this case for further fact finding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we vacate the decision of the district court and direct dismissal of the government's forfeiture action with prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In a civil forfeiture case, the government must first establish probable cause to believe that a nexus existed between the property and specified illegal activity sufficient to justify forfeiture. This shifts the burden to the claimant, who must refute the government's prima facie case either (1) by demonstrating that the property was not in fact used for the specified illegal activity or (2) by proving that she (the claimant) did not know about or consent to the illicit activity. See, e.g., United States v. 15 Bosworth St., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">236</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span></span>, 116 n.7 (1st Cir. 2001); United States v.

Forfeiture of the proceeds of illegal drug transactions was initially limited to all moneys, negotiable instruments, securities, and other things of value furnished by any person in exchange for a controlled substance, and all proceeds traceable to the exchange. See Psychotropic Substances Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-633, 92 Stat. 3768, 3777.

See 507 U.S. at 139 (Scalia, J., concurring) (\"I do not find inconceivable the possibility that post-illegal-act transferees with post-illegal-act knowledge of the earlier illegality are provided a defense against forfeiture.

See 886 F.2d at 626. Specifically, the court read in the disjunctive the language in 21 U.S.C. &#167; 881(a)(7) barring forfeiture if the claimant could show lack of knowledge or consent. It therefore allowed the claimant to show either one or the other, as opposed to requiring that he show both. See id. In One 1973 Rolls Royce, the Third Circuit held that the 6109 Grubb Road analysis applied equally to pre-illegal-act owners (the situation in 6109 Grubb Road) and post-illegal act owners (the situation in One 1973 Rolls Royce).

See M.G.L.A. ch. 305, &#167; 1A (1978); 21 Dunphy, Massachusetts Practice &#167; 7.1, at 95 (2d ed. 1997).</p>\n        <p>The common law property concept of dower developed during the middle ages in England, when land was the main source of wealth and the basis of an agrarian society. Under the system of femme covert, husband and wife merged into a single legal identity, and all of a woman's property and earnings belonged to her husband. In return for relinquishing control over all of her property, the law of dower required that the husband provide his wife with support and maintenance, especially during her widowhood. Dower rights, which attached to the land at the moment of marriage, generally allowed a wife a one third share in a life estate in all freehold land that the husband owned during the marriage and that was inheritable by the legal heirs of the husband and wife. See Kathleen M. O'Connor, Note, Marital Property Reform in Massachusetts: A Choice for the New Millennium, 34 New. Eng. L. Rev. 261, 272-75 (1999). During the nineteenth century, Massachusetts, like other states, passed married women's property acts which gave wives greater rights over property and earnings, including the right to keep and manage as their own property that they had brought to or acquired after the marriage by gift, inheritance, bequest, or devise. See id. at 303 (describing Massachusetts legislation passed in 1845).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> While the dower interest is a life estate in real property, M.G.L.A. ch. 189, &#167; 1, both a surviving spouse's elective share, id. ch. 191, &#167; 15, and intestate share, id. ch. 190, &#167; 1, are interests in fee simple. In light of these other protections, it is generally no longer advisable for a surviving spouse to claim dower, except under unusual circumstances (such as when the decedent has extensive debts, over which the dower interest had priority).
