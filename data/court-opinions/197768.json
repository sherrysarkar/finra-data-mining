GIBSON, Senior  Circuit Judge.   Gaurav Mangla\r                    JOHN  R. GIBSON, Senior  Circuit Judge.\r                                                          \r\n\nappeals from a  judgment as a matter  of law entered in  favor of\r\n\nBrown University following a trial  on his breach of contract and\r\n\npromissory  estoppel claims.   He argues that  the district court\r\n\nerred in granting judgment, as a reasonable jury could have found\r\n\nthat Brown breached  the contract, acted  arbitrarily and in  bad\r\n\nfaith, and that Brown was  estopped from denying him admission to\r\n\nthe graduate school.  He  argues that the court improperly raised\r\n\ncertain evidence  and overlooked and misconstrued  other evidence\r\n\nin  reaching  this decision.    We  affirm  the judgment  of  the\r\n\ndistrict court.\r\n\n          Mangla applied  for  admission to  the  Brown  Graduate\r\n\nSchool in  September  1993, and  was admitted  as a  probationary\r\n\nspecial  student,   a  category of  enrollment  that permits  the\r\n\ntaking of  graduate level  courses but which  is not in  itself a\r\n\ndegree program.   His admission in this capacity  was recommended\r\n\nby the Computer  Science Department and approved  by the graduate\r\n\ncouncil.   Associate Dean Joan Lusk met  with Mangla at that time\r\n\nand explained to him that  his admission was probationary because\r\n\nhe lacked  the requisite academic  background or  course work  in\r\n\ncomputer science.  Lusk further told   Mangla that in order to be\r\n\nadmitted to  the  degree program  he would  need to  successfully\r\n\ncomplete course  work in the Computer Science Department.  Mangla\r\n\nclaims  to have  satisfactorily  completed  seven  of  the  eight\r\n\ncourses required for a Master's degree. \r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n          After completing such course  work, Mangla inquired  of\r\n\nDean  Lusk about his probationary status,  and she instructed him\r\n\nto  obtain  a faculty  advisor  for  his  Master's Project.    In\r\n\nresponse,  Mangla obtained a  letter signed by  Professor Stanley\r\n\nZdonik, stating that Mangla \"will be working under my supervision\r\n\nfor  his Master's project.\"   Mangla claims  that at the  time he\r\n\nbelieved  the letter  served as  a  letter of  recommendation for\r\n\nadmission into the degree program.\r\n\n          In  September  1995,  Brown informed  Mangla  that  his\r\n\nspecial student status was discontinued  and that he had not been\r\n\nadmitted into  the Master's program.   Mangla thereafter  filed a\r\n\nnew,  formal application for admission into the Master's program.\r\n\nThe  Computer   Science  Department  faculty   reviewed  the  new\r\n\napplication and voted  to recommend that Mangla's  application be\r\n\ndenied.  Mangla then appealed to the Graduate Council which voted\r\n\nunanimously to uphold the department's decision.\r\n\n          Mangla brought this  action for breach of  contract and\r\n\npromissory  estoppel for  Brown's refusal to  admit him  into its\r\n\nMaster's program.  The action was tried before a jury, but at the\r\n\nclose  of evidence, the judge granted judgment as a matter of law\r\n\nto Brown  and dictated  detailed findings into  the record.   The\r\n\ndistrict court first decided that there was no breach of contract\r\n\nbecause Mangla  knew  that one  of the  things he  had  to do  in\r\n\nperforming his  side of  the contract was  to obtain  a favorable\r\n\nrecommendation from the  Computer Science Department faculty  and\r\n\nthere was no evidence that  any such recommendation was obtained.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nThe court acknowledged Mangla's testimony that Dean Lusk told him\r\n\nhe would absolutely be admitted if he passed his courses or if he\r\n\ngot a faculty  member to act  as his advisor.  The court  stated,\r\n\nhowever,  that the  key testimony  was  Mangla's admissions  that\r\n\nnotwithstanding  anything that  Dean Lusk  may have told  him, he\r\n\nknew that a recommendation from the faculty was a requirement for\r\n\nhis admission into the Master's Program.\r\n\n          The  court further found  that there was  no promissory\r\n\nestoppel because there  was no reasonable reliance on  any of the\r\n\nalleged  representations.   There was  explicit  language in  the\r\n\nGraduate School manual that even the department does not have the\r\n\npower to  offer  admission  and that  offers  of  admission  have\r\n\nbinding force only  when made by the Graduate  School in writing.\r\n\nThe court stated  that Mangla's argument that he  was entitled to\r\n\nthe  written  offer   of  admission  is   nothing  more  than   a\r\n\ncircumvention  of the  explicit  requirement  set  forth  in  the\r\n\nGraduate School manual.  Further,  the district court stated that\r\n\nit was quite a stretch  to interpret Professor Zdonik's letter as\r\n\namounting to  a recommendation by  the Department that  Mangla be\r\n\naccepted.  Even viewing the letter in the light most favorable to\r\n\nMangla, the district  court determined that  it defied logic  and\r\n\nreason to read  the letter as a recommendation  from the Computer\r\n\nScience Department.  Thus, the district court held that there was\r\n\nno issue for the jury to decide, and judgment as a matter of  law\r\n\nwas granted.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n                                I.\r                                          I.\r\n\n          In ruling on a motion for  judgment as a matter of law,\r\n\nthe  district court must examine  the evidence, and inferences to\r\n\nbe  drawn therefrom,  in the  light  most favorable  to the  non-\r\n\nmovant.  See  Rol n-Alvarado v. Municipality of San  Juan, 1 F.3d\r                                                                   \r\n\n74, 76 (1st Cir. 1993).  Judgment as a matter  of law may then be\r\n\ngranted \"only if  the evidence, viewed from this  perspective, is\r\n\nsuch that reasonable  minds could not differ as  to the outcome.\"\r\n\nId. at 77.\r             \r\n\n          When a judgment as a matter  of law is appealed to this\r\n\ncourt,  we must apply precisely the  same criteria that constrain\r\n\nthe district  court. See Gibson v. City of Cranston, 37 F.3d 731,\r                                                             \r\n\n735  (1st  Cir. 1994).    Accordingly,  we  review the  grant  of\r\n\njudgment as  a  matter of  law under  a de  novo  standard.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nJordan-Milton Mach., Inc.  v. F/V Teresa Marie, II,  978 F.2d 32,\r                                                            \r\n\n34 (1st Cir. 1992).\r\n\n                               II.\r                                         II.\r\n\n          Mangla argues  that judgment  as  a matter  of law  was\r\n\ninappropriate because  a reasonable  jury could  find that  Brown\r\n\nUniversity breached a contract with Mangla by refusing  to confer\r\n\nregular degree status upon him.\r\n\n          The  district   court,  in  this  diversity  case,  was\r\n\nrequired to apply the substantive  law of Rhode Island.  However,\r\n\nafter careful research,  we have discovered no case  in which the\r\n\nRhode Island courts  have addressed the contractual  relationship\r\n\nbetween  a private  academic institution  and its  students.   We\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\ntherefore  resolve Mangla's breach of contract claim according to\r\n\nthose  legal principles which we believe  the Rhode Island courts\r\n\nwould most likely adopt.  See Lyons v. Salve Regina  College, 565\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 200, 202 (1st Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 971 (1978).\r                                                     \r\n\n          The   student-college   relationship   is   essentially\r\n\ncontractual in nature.  See  Russell v. Salve Regina College, 938\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d  315, 316 (1st  Cir. 1991).   The terms of  the contract may\r\n\ninclude statements provided in  student manuals and  registration\r\n\nmaterials.  See Lyons, 565 F.2d at 202 (construing College Manual\r                               \r\n\nand Academic Information booklet as terms of a contract between a\r\n\nstudent  and college).  The proper  standard for interpreting the\r\n\ncontractual  terms is  that of  \"reasonable  expectation --  what\r\n\nmeaning  the  party  making  the  manifestation,  the university,\r\n\nshould  reasonably expect  the  other  party to  give  it.\"   Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\n(quoting  Giles  v.  Howard University,  428  F.  Supp. 603,  605\r                                                \r\n\n(D.D.C. 1977)).\r\n\n          Mangla maintains that he reasonably expected that if he\r\n\nsatisfactorily performed his  course work and obtained  a sponsor\r\n\nfor  his master's  project he  would  be admitted  as a  master's\r\n\ndegree  candidate in  the Computer  Science  Department.   Mangla\r\n\nbases his claim on the  alleged statements of Associate Dean Lusk\r\n\nand members of the Computer Science Department faculty.  However,\r\n\nBrown University's graduate school catalog specifically provided:\r\n\n            Caveat.    Applicants are  asked  to take\r\n            particular notice  of the  fact that  the\r\n            individual  academic  departments,  while\r\n            having  a  major role  in  evaluating the\r\n            applications  of all  candidates, do  not\r\n            have  the power  to offer  admission, and\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n            that  offers  of admission  have  binding\r\n            force  only  when  made  by the  Graduate\r\n            School in  writing over the  signature of\r\n            the Dean  of the Graduate  School or  her\r\n            representative.\r\n\n          By its terms,  this provision divested faculty  members\r\n\nof  any authority  to  promise  admission  or  to  determine  the\r\n\nnecessary prerequisites for admission.  Because the provision was\r\n\nincluded in the  graduate school catalog, Brown  could reasonably\r\n\nexpect  students  to  be  aware of  the  policy.    Thus,  it was\r\n\nreasonable for Brown to  expect its students not to  rely on oral\r\n\nstatements by individual  faculty members as binding  promises by\r\n\nthe university.\r\n\n          Likewise, the statements of Associate Dean Lusk did not\r\n\ngive  Mangla   a  right   to  be  admitted.     As   an  apparent\r\n\nrepresentative of  the Dean of the Graduate School, Lusk arguably\r\n\nhad  the  authority to  offer  admission.   The  caveat, however,\r\n\nrestricted  the acceptable  form of  such  an offer  to a  signed\r\n\nwriting.   Mangla concedes  that no such  writing exists  in this\r\n\ncase.   Therefore,  the language of  the graduate  school catalog\r\n\nseriously compromises Mangla's claim that Lusk's  statements gave\r\n\nhim a contractual right to be offered admission.\r\n\n          As  Mangla  correctly  asserts,   the  graduate  school\r\n\ncatalog is not  a wholly integrated contract but  instead is only\r\n\none part of a  more complex contractual relationship between  the\r\n\nstudent and  the college.   We do  not foreclose  the possibility\r\n\nthat, under certain circumstances, the  university could obligate\r\n\nitself through the actions and  oral statements of its officials,\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\ndespite the language of the caveat provision.  A reasonable jury,\r\n\nhowever, could  not find that  such circumstances  exist in  this\r\n\ncase.\r\n\n          Particularly fatal to  Mangla's contract claim in  this\r\n\ncase  was  his  failure  to  secure  a  recommendation  from  the\r\n\ndepartment faculty.  Mangla admitted at  trial that he understood\r\n\nthat a faculty recommendation was a prerequisite to his admission\r\n\nas  a  regular degree  candidate.    Mangla maintains  that  this\r\n\nrequirement was reasonably  met by a  letter signed by  Professor\r\n\nZdonik, a member of the Computer Science department faculty.  The\r\n\nZdonik  letter  does  not,  however,  recommend  that  Mangla  be\r\n\nadmitted.   Rather,  the letter,  addressed \"To  whomever  it may\r\n\nconcern,\" identifies Mangla  as a graduate student  working under\r\n\nZdonik's supervision \"for his Master's project\" and requests that\r\n\nMangla be  provided with  help and the  use of resources  for his\r\n\nresearch while living in Princeton,  New Jersey.  Mangla does not\r\n\nclaim to have  informed Zdonik of his intent to use the letter as\r\n\na letter of recommendation.  Indeed, Mangla does not even contend\r\n\nthe letter  was a  faculty recommendation,  but instead  contends\r\n\nthat  he  reasonably  believed  it  was  the  \"equivalent   of  a\r\n\nrecommendation.\"   No reasonable jury  could find that the letter\r\n\nsigned  by  Zdonik  reasonably fulfilled  the  prerequisite  of a\r\n\nfaculty recommendation.   As a  result, no reasonable  jury could\r\n\nconclude that  Brown should  have reasonably  expected Mangla  to\r\n\nbelieve  that the university was contractually obligated to admit\r\n\nhim.\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\n                               III.\r                                         III.\r\n\n          Mangla  argues that a  jury could reasonably  find that\r\n\nBrown  acted arbitrarily  or in  bad faith  in refusing  to admit\r\n\nMangla  as  a  regular  degree candidate.    Brown  responds that\r\n\nMangla's  claim   of   arbitrariness  must   fail   because   the\r\n\nuniversity's   decision   did  not   substantially   depart  from\r\n\nestablished academic norms.\r\n\n          Under Rhode  Island law,  contracts contain an  implied\r\n\nduty of good faith  and fair dealing.  See A.A.A.  Pool Service &amp;\r                                                                           \r\n\nSupply, Inc.  v. Aetna Casualty &amp;  Surety Co., 395 A.2d  724, 725\r                                                       \r\n\n(R.I. 1978).  Because the parties  do not  contend otherwise,  we\r\n\nassume for  the purposes  of argument that  Brown's duty  of good\r\n\nfaith   extended  to  its  review  of  Mangla's  application  for\r\n\nadmission as a degree candidate.   We thus turn our focus to  the\r\n\nquestion of whether Brown met that duty.\r\n\n          The decision to grant or deny admission to a student is\r\n\na quintessential matter  of academic judgment.   Courts have long\r\n\nrecognized that matters of academic judgment are generally better\r\n\nleft to  the educational institutions  than to the  judiciary and\r\n\nhave accorded  great deference where  such matters are  at issue.\r\n\nAs the Supreme Court stated  in Regents of University of Michigan\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Ewing,  474 U.S. 214,  225 (1985), \"Plainly, [judges]  may not\r                  \r\n\noverride  [the faculty's professional judgment] unless it is such\r\n\na  substantial departure  from  accepted  academic  norms  as  to\r\n\ndemonstrate  that the  person or  committee  responsible did  not\r\n\nactually exercise professional judgment.\"\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\n          Applying the standard of deference enunciated in Ewing,\r                                                                          \r\n\nwe conclude that  no reasonable jury could find  that Brown acted\r\n\narbitrarily  or in  bad faith in  refusing to  admit Mangla  as a\r\n\nregular  degree  candidate.    The  Computer  Science  Department\r\n\nrecommended  against Mangla's admission on the ground that Mangla\r\n\ndid  not  demonstrate an  ability  to undertake  the  research or\r\n\nindependent work required for a  Master's thesis or project.  The\r\n\ndepartment's position was  based in part on  negative assessments\r\n\nof  Mangla's research capabilities provided by professors who had\r\n\nsupervised Mangla's previous attempts at a research project.\r\n\n          Mangla argues  the department's decision  was arbitrary\r\n\nand in bad faith  because he was never informed that  he would be\r\n\njudged  on  his  ability  to do  independent  research.   Mangla,\r\n\nhowever,  was aware  that  a  Master's thesis  or  project was  a\r\n\nnecessary component  of the Master's  program.  We believe  it is\r\n\nself-evident  that  a  committee evaluating  an  application  for\r\n\nadmission into  a Master's  program would  be concerned  with the\r\n\napplicant's  prospects  of  successfully  completing  the  degree\r\n\nrequirements.\r\n\n          The  evidence  establishes  that  Brown  judged  Mangla\r\n\naccording  to legitimate criteria and  had a sufficient basis for\r\n\nbelieving that Mangla did not meet those criteria.  Consequently,\r\n\nno reasonable jury could infer that Brown acted arbitrarily or in\r\n\nbad  faith when  it  decided  not to  admit  Mangla  as a  degree\r\n\ncandidate.\r\n\n                               IV.\r                                         IV.\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\n          Finally,  Mangla argues  that a  reasonable  jury could\r\n\nhave  found Brown  liable on  a promissory  estoppel theory.   We\r\n\nreject his argument.\r\n\n          Under Rhode Island  law, \"A promise which  the promisor\r\n\nshould reasonably expect to  induce action or forbearance on  the\r\n\npart of the promisee or a third person and which does induce such\r\n\naction or forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only\r\n\nby  enforcement  of  the  promise.\"    B.M.L.

He argues that the district court erred in granting judgment, as a reasonable jury could have found that Brown breached the contract, acted arbitrarily and in bad faith, and that Brown was estopped from denying him admission to the graduate school.  He argues that the court improperly raised certain evidence and overlooked and misconstrued other evidence in reaching this decision.  We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mangla applied for admission to the Brown Graduate School in September 1993, and was admitted as a probationary special student, a category of enrollment that permits the taking of graduate level courses but which is not in itself a degree program.  His admission in this capacity was recommended by the Computer Science Department and approved by the graduate council.  Associate Dean Joan Lusk met with Mangla at that time and explained to him that his admission was probationary because he lacked the requisite academic background or course work in computer science.  Lusk further told Mangla that in order to be admitted to the degree program he would need to successfully complete course work in the Computer Science Department.  Mangla claims to have satisfactorily completed seven of the eight courses required for a Master's degree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After completing such course work, Mangla inquired of Dean Lusk about his probationary status, and she instructed him to obtain a faculty advisor for his Master's Project.  In response, Mangla obtained a letter signed by Professor Stanley Zdonik, stating that Mangla \"will be working under my supervision for his Master's project.\"   Mangla claims that at the time he believed the letter served as a letter of recommendation for admission into the degree program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1995, Brown informed Mangla that his special student status was discontinued and that he had not been admitted into the Master's program.  Mangla thereafter filed a new, formal application for admission into the Master's program.  The Computer Science Department faculty reviewed the new application and voted to recommend that Mangla's application be denied.  Mangla then appealed to the Graduate Council which voted unanimously to uphold the department's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mangla brought this action for breach of contract and promissory estoppel for Brown's refusal to admit him into its Master's program.  The action was tried before a jury, but at the close of evidence, the judge granted judgment as a matter of law to Brown and dictated detailed findings into the record.  The district court first decided that there was no breach of contract because Mangla knew that one of the things he had to do in performing his side of the contract was to obtain a favorable recommendation from the Computer Science Department faculty and there was no evidence that any such recommendation was obtained.  The court acknowledged Mangla's testimony that Dean Lusk told him he would absolutely be admitted if he passed his courses or if he got a faculty member to act as his advisor.  The court stated, however, that the key testimony was Mangla's admissions that notwithstanding anything that Dean Lusk may have told him, he knew that a recommendation from the faculty was a requirement for his admission into the Master's Program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court further found that there was no promissory estoppel because there was no reasonable reliance on any of the alleged representations.  There was explicit language in the Graduate School manual that even the department does not have the power to offer admission and that offers of admission have binding force only when made by the Graduate School in writing.  The court stated that Mangla's argument that he was entitled to the written offer of admission is nothing more than a circumvention of the explicit requirement set forth in the Graduate School manual.  Further, the district court stated that it was quite a stretch to interpret Professor Zdonik's letter as amounting to a recommendation by the Department that Mangla be accepted.  Even viewing the letter in the light most favorable to Mangla, the district court determined that it defied logic and reason to read the letter as a recommendation from the Computer Science Department.  Thus, the district court held that there was no issue for the jury to decide, and judgment as a matter of law was granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In ruling on a motion for judgment as a matter of law, the district court must examine the evidence, and inferences to be drawn therefrom, in the light most favorable to the non-movant.  See Roln-Alvarado v. Municipality of San Juan, 1 F.3d 74, 76 (1st Cir.1993).  Judgment as a matter of law may then be granted \"only if the evidence, viewed from this perspective, is such that reasonable minds could not differ as to the outcome.\"  Id. at 77.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a judgment as a matter of law is appealed to this court, we must apply precisely the same criteria that constrain the district court.  See Gibson v. City of Cranston, 37 F.3d 731, 735 (1st Cir.1994).  Accordingly, we review the grant of judgment as a matter of law under a de novo standard.  See Jordan-Milton Mach., Inc. v. F/V Teresa Marie, II, 978 F.2d 32, 34 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mangla argues that judgment as a matter of law was inappropriate because a reasonable jury could find that Brown University breached a contract with Mangla by refusing to confer regular degree status upon him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, in this diversity case, was required to apply the substantive law of Rhode Island.  However, after careful research, we have discovered no case in which the Rhode Island courts have addressed the contractual relationship between a private academic institution and its students.  We therefore resolve Mangla's breach of contract claim according to those legal principles which we believe the Rhode Island courts would most likely adopt.  See Lyons v. Salve Regina College, 565 F.2d 200, 202 (1st Cir.1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 971, 98 S.Ct. 1611, 56 L.Ed.2d 62 (1978).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The student-college relationship is essentially contractual in nature.  See Russell v. Salve Regina College, 938 F.2d 315, 316 (1st Cir.1991).  The terms of the contract may include statements provided in student manuals and registration materials.  See Lyons, 565 F.2d at 202 (construing College Manual and Academic Information booklet as terms of a contract between a student and college).  The proper standard for interpreting the contractual terms is that of \"reasonable expectation--what meaning the party making the manifestation, the university, should reasonably expect the other party to give it.\"  Id. (quoting Giles v. Howard University, 428 F.Supp. 603, 605 (D.D.C.1977)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mangla maintains that he reasonably expected that if he satisfactorily performed his course work and obtained a sponsor for his master's project he would be admitted as a master's degree candidate in the Computer Science Department.  Mangla bases his claim on the alleged statements of Associate Dean Lusk and members of the Computer Science Department faculty.  However, Brown University's graduate school catalog specifically provided:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>Caveat.  Applicants are asked to take particular notice of the fact that the individual academic departments, while having a major role in evaluating the applications of all candidates, do not have the power to offer admission, and that offers of admission have binding force only when made by the Graduate School in writing over the signature of the Dean of the Graduate School or her representative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By its terms, this provision divested faculty members of any authority to promise admission or to determine the necessary prerequisites for admission.  Because the provision was included in the graduate school catalog, Brown could reasonably expect students to be aware of the policy.  Thus, it was reasonable for Brown to expect its students not to rely on oral statements by individual faculty members as binding promises by the university.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Likewise, the statements of Associate Dean Lusk did not give Mangla a right to be admitted.  As an apparent representative of the Dean of the Graduate School, Lusk arguably had the authority to offer admission.  The caveat, however, restricted the acceptable form of such an offer to a signed writing.  Mangla concedes that no such writing exists in this case.  Therefore, the language of the graduate school catalog seriously compromises Mangla's claim that Lusk's statements gave him a contractual right to be offered admission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Mangla correctly asserts, the graduate school catalog is not a wholly integrated contract but instead is only one part of a more complex contractual relationship between the student and the college.  We do not foreclose the possibility that, under certain circumstances, the university could obligate itself through the actions and oral statements of its officials, despite the language of the caveat provision.  A reasonable jury, however, could not find that such circumstances exist in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Particularly fatal to Mangla's contract claim in this case was his failure to secure a recommendation from the department faculty.  Mangla admitted at trial that he understood that a faculty recommendation was a prerequisite to his admission as a regular degree candidate.  Mangla maintains that this requirement was reasonably met by a letter signed by Professor Zdonik, a member of the Computer Science department faculty.  The Zdonik letter does not, however, recommend that Mangla be admitted.  Rather, the letter, addressed \"To whomever it may concern,\" identifies Mangla as a graduate student working under Zdonik's supervision \"for his Master's project\" and requests that Mangla be provided with help and the use of resources for his research while living in Princeton, New Jersey.  Mangla does not claim to have informed Zdonik of his intent to use the letter as a letter of recommendation.  Indeed, Mangla does not even contend the letter was a faculty recommendation, but instead contends that he reasonably believed it was the \"equivalent of a recommendation.\"   No reasonable jury could find that the letter signed by Zdonik reasonably fulfilled the prerequisite of a faculty recommendation.  As a result, no reasonable jury could conclude that Brown should have reasonably expected Mangla to believe that the university was contractually obligated to admit him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mangla argues that a jury could reasonably find that Brown acted arbitrarily or in bad faith in refusing to admit Mangla as a regular degree candidate.  Brown responds that Mangla's claim of arbitrariness must fail because the university's decision did not substantially depart from established academic norms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Rhode Island law, contracts contain an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.  See A.A.A. Pool Service &amp; Supply, Inc. v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., 121 R.I. 96, 395 A.2d 724, 725 (1978).  Because the parties do not contend otherwise, we assume for the purposes of argument that Brown's duty of good faith extended to its review of Mangla's application for admission as a degree candidate.  We thus turn our focus to the question of whether Brown met that duty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision to grant or deny admission to a student is a quintessential matter of academic judgment.  Courts have long recognized that matters of academic judgment are generally better left to the educational institutions than to the judiciary and have accorded great deference where such matters are at issue.  As the Supreme Court stated in Regents of University of Michigan v. Ewing, 474 U.S. 214, 225, 106 S.Ct. 507, 513, 88 L.Ed.2d 523 (1985), \"Plainly, [judges] may not override [the faculty's professional judgment] unless it is such a substantial departure from accepted academic norms as to demonstrate that the person or committee responsible did not actually exercise professional judgment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the standard of deference enunciated in Ewing, we conclude that no reasonable jury could find that Brown acted arbitrarily or in bad faith in refusing to admit Mangla as a regular degree candidate.  The Computer Science Department recommended against Mangla's admission on the ground that Mangla did not demonstrate an ability to undertake the research or independent work required for a Master's thesis or project.  The department's position was based in part on negative assessments of Mangla's research capabilities provided by professors who had supervised Mangla's previous attempts at a research project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mangla argues the department's decision was arbitrary and in bad faith because he was never informed that he would be judged on his ability to do independent research.  Mangla, however, was aware that a Master's thesis or project was a necessary component of the Master's program.  We believe it is self-evident that a committee evaluating an application for admission into a Master's program would be concerned with the applicant's prospects of successfully completing the degree requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence establishes that Brown judged Mangla according to legitimate criteria and had a sufficient basis for believing that Mangla did not meet those criteria.  Consequently, no reasonable jury could infer that Brown acted arbitrarily or in bad faith when it decided not to admit Mangla as a degree candidate.IV.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Mangla argues that a reasonable jury could have found Brown liable on a promissory estoppel theory.  We reject his argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Rhode Island law, \"A promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee or a third person and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.\"  B.M.L. Corp. v. Greater Providence Deposit Corp., et al., 495 A.2d 675, 677 (R.I.1985) (quoting 1 Restatement (Second) Contracts &#167; 90 at 242 (1981)).  Thus, the proper focus of our inquiry is again on the reasonable expectations of the party making the manifestation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have previously discussed, Brown should not have reasonably expected Mangla to rely on the oral statements of Dean Lusk or the individual faculty members as binding promises of admission.  Therefore, we uphold the district court's ruling that no reasonable jury could find that Brown was estopped from denying Mangla admission as a Master's degree candidate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the judgment as a matter of law in favor of Brown University.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s-s_ref\">**</a>\n        <p> Of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The court stated, however, that the key testimony was Mangla's admissions that notwithstanding anything that Dean Lusk may have told him, he knew that a recommendation from the faculty was a requirement for his admission into the Master's Program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court further found that there was no promissory estoppel because there was no reasonable reliance on any of the alleged representations.  There was explicit language in the Graduate School manual that even the department does not have the power to offer admission and that offers of admission have binding force only when made by the Graduate School in writing.  The court stated that Mangla's argument that he was entitled to the written offer of admission is nothing more than a circumvention of the explicit requirement set forth in the Graduate School manual.  Further, the district court stated that it was quite a stretch to interpret Professor Zdonik's letter as amounting to a recommendation by the Department that Mangla be accepted.  Even viewing the letter in the light most favorable to Mangla, the district court determined that it defied logic and reason to read the letter as a recommendation from the Computer Science Department.  Thus, the district court held that there was no issue for the jury to decide, and judgment as a matter of law was granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In ruling on a motion for judgment as a matter of law, the district court must examine the evidence, and inferences to be drawn therefrom, in the light most favorable to the non-movant.  See Roln-Alvarado v. Municipality of San Juan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194861\"><a href=\"/opinion/194861/rolon-alvarado-v-municipality-of-sj/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span>, 76 (1st Cir.1993).  Judgment as a matter of law may then be granted \"only if the evidence, viewed from this perspective, is such that reasonable minds could not differ as to the outcome.\"  Id. at 77.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a judgment as a matter of law is appealed to this court, we must apply precisely the same criteria that constrain the district court.  See Gibson v. City of Cranston, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195652\"><a href=\"/opinion/195652/gibson-v-city-of-cranston/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span>, 735 (1st Cir.1994).  Accordingly, we review the grant of judgment as a matter of law under a de novo standard.  See Jordan-Milton Mach., Inc. v. F/V Teresa Marie, II, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593295\"><a href=\"/opinion/593295/jordan-milton-machinery-inc-v-fv-teresa-marie-ii/\"><span class=\"volume\">978</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span>, 34 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mangla argues that judgment as a matter of law was inappropriate because a reasonable jury could find that Brown University breached a contract with Mangla by refusing to confer regular degree status upon him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, in this diversity case, was required to apply the substantive law of Rhode Island.  However, after careful research, we have discovered no case in which the Rhode Island courts have addressed the contractual relationship between a private academic institution and its students.  We therefore resolve Mangla's breach of contract claim according to those legal principles which we believe the Rhode Island courts would most likely adopt.  See Lyons v. Salve Regina College, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"350520\"><a href=\"/opinion/350520/sheila-m-lyons-v-salve-regina-college-and-sheila-m-megley-phd/\"><span class=\"volume\">565</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span>, 202 (1st Cir.1977), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">971</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

See Russell v. Salve Regina College, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564773\"><a href=\"/opinion/564773/sharon-l-russell-v-salve-regina-college-sharon-l-russell-v-salve/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span></a></span>, 316 (1st Cir.1991).  The terms of the contract may include statements provided in student manuals and registration materials.  See Lyons, 565 F.2d at 202 (construing College Manual and Academic Information booklet as terms of a contract between a student and college).  The proper standard for interpreting the contractual terms is that of \"reasonable expectation--what meaning the party making the manifestation, the university, should reasonably expect the other party to give it.\"  Id. (quoting Giles v. Howard University, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1792271\"><a href=\"/opinion/1792271/giles-v-howard-university/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></a></span>, 605 (D.D.C.1977)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mangla maintains that he reasonably expected that if he satisfactorily performed his course work and obtained a sponsor for his master's project he would be admitted as a master's degree candidate in the Computer Science Department.  Mangla bases his claim on the alleged statements of Associate Dean Lusk and members of the Computer Science Department faculty.  However, Brown University's graduate school catalog specifically provided:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>Caveat.  Applicants are asked to take particular notice of the fact that the individual academic departments, while having a major role in evaluating the applications of all candidates, do not have the power to offer admission, and that offers of admission have binding force only when made by the Graduate School in writing over the signature of the Dean of the Graduate School or her representative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By its terms, this provision divested faculty members of any authority to promise admission or to determine the necessary prerequisites for admission.  Because the provision was included in the graduate school catalog, Brown could reasonably expect students to be aware of the policy.  Thus, it was reasonable for Brown to expect its students not to rely on oral statements by individual faculty members as binding promises by the university.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Likewise, the statements of Associate Dean Lusk did not give Mangla a right to be admitted.  As an apparent representative of the Dean of the Graduate School, Lusk arguably had the authority to offer admission.  The caveat, however, restricted the acceptable form of such an offer to a signed writing.  Mangla concedes that no such writing exists in this case.  Therefore, the language of the graduate school catalog seriously compromises Mangla's claim that Lusk's statements gave him a contractual right to be offered admission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Mangla correctly asserts, the graduate school catalog is not a wholly integrated contract but instead is only one part of a more complex contractual relationship between the student and the college.  We do not foreclose the possibility that, under certain circumstances, the university could obligate itself through the actions and oral statements of its officials, despite the language of the caveat provision.  A reasonable jury, however, could not find that such circumstances exist in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Particularly fatal to Mangla's contract claim in this case was his failure to secure a recommendation from the department faculty.  Mangla admitted at trial that he understood that a faculty recommendation was a prerequisite to his admission as a regular degree candidate.  Mangla maintains that this requirement was reasonably met by a letter signed by Professor Zdonik, a member of the Computer Science department faculty.  The Zdonik letter does not, however, recommend that Mangla be admitted.  Rather, the letter, addressed \"To whomever it may concern,\" identifies Mangla as a graduate student working under Zdonik's supervision \"for his Master's project\" and requests that Mangla be provided with help and the use of resources for his research while living in Princeton, New Jersey.  Mangla does not claim to have informed Zdonik of his intent to use the letter as a letter of recommendation.  Indeed, Mangla does not even contend the letter was a faculty recommendation, but instead contends that he reasonably believed it was the \"equivalent of a recommendation.\"   No reasonable jury could find that the letter signed by Zdonik reasonably fulfilled the prerequisite of a faculty recommendation.  As a result, no reasonable jury could conclude that Brown should have reasonably expected Mangla to believe that the university was contractually obligated to admit him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mangla argues that a jury could reasonably find that Brown acted arbitrarily or in bad faith in refusing to admit Mangla as a regular degree candidate.  Brown responds that Mangla's claim of arbitrariness must fail because the university's decision did not substantially depart from established academic norms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Rhode Island law, contracts contain an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.  See A.A.A. Pool Service &amp; Supply, Inc. v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">R.I.</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1501960\"><a href=\"/opinion/1501960/aaa-pool-serv-supply-v-aetna-cas-sur-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">724</span></a></span>, 725 (1978).  Because the parties do not contend otherwise, we assume for the purposes of argument that Brown's duty of good faith extended to its review of Mangla's application for admission as a degree candidate.  We thus turn our focus to the question of whether Brown met that duty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision to grant or deny admission to a student is a quintessential matter of academic judgment.  Courts have long recognized that matters of academic judgment are generally better left to the educational institutions than to the judiciary and have accorded great deference where such matters are at issue.  As the Supreme Court stated in Regents of University of Michigan v. Ewing, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111549\"><a href=\"/opinion/111549/regents-of-univ-of-mich-v-ewing/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">214</span></a></span>, 225, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111549\"><a href=\"/opinion/111549/regents-of-univ-of-mich-v-ewing/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span>, 513, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111549\"><a href=\"/opinion/111549/regents-of-univ-of-mich-v-ewing/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">523</span></a></span> (1985), \"Plainly, [judges] may not override [the faculty's professional judgment] unless it is such a substantial departure from accepted academic norms as to demonstrate that the person or committee responsible did not actually exercise professional judgment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the standard of deference enunciated in Ewing, we conclude that no reasonable jury could find that Brown acted arbitrarily or in bad faith in refusing to admit Mangla as a regular degree candidate.  The Computer Science Department recommended against Mangla's admission on the ground that Mangla did not demonstrate an ability to undertake the research or independent work required for a Master's thesis or project.  The department's position was based in part on negative assessments of Mangla's research capabilities provided by professors who had supervised Mangla's previous attempts at a research project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mangla argues the department's decision was arbitrary and in bad faith because he was never informed that he would be judged on his ability to do independent research.  Mangla, however, was aware that a Master's thesis or project was a necessary component of the Master's program.  We believe it is self-evident that a committee evaluating an application for admission into a Master's program would be concerned with the applicant's prospects of successfully completing the degree requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence establishes that Brown judged Mangla according to legitimate criteria and had a sufficient basis for believing that Mangla did not meet those criteria.  Consequently, no reasonable jury could infer that Brown acted arbitrarily or in bad faith when it decided not to admit Mangla as a degree candidate.IV.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Mangla argues that a reasonable jury could have found Brown liable on a promissory estoppel theory.  We reject his argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Rhode Island law, \"A promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee or a third person and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.\"  B.M.L. Corp. v. Greater Providence Deposit Corp., et al., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">675</span></span>, 677 (R.I.1985) (quoting 1 Restatement (Second) Contracts &#167; 90 at 242 (1981)).  Thus, the proper focus of our inquiry is again on the reasonable expectations of the party making the manifestation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have previously discussed, Brown should not have reasonably expected Mangla to rely on the oral statements of Dean Lusk or the individual faculty members as binding promises of admission.  Therefore, we uphold the district court's ruling that no reasonable jury could find that Brown was estopped from denying Mangla admission as a Master's degree candidate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the judgment as a matter of law in favor of Brown University.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s-s_ref\">**</a>\n        <p> Of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
