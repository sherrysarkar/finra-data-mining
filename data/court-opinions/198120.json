Salvador E. Casellas, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                 Selya, Stahl and Lynch,\r\n                    Circuit Judges.\r\n\n Gilberto Figueroa-Rios and Gilberto Figueroa-Rios Law Officeon brief for appellant Luis Madera-Castro.\r\n Lydia Lizarribar-Masini on brief for appellant Pedro Carrera-\r\nGonzalez.\r\n Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Jose A. Quiles-\r\nEspinosa, Senior Litigation Counsel, and Nelson Perez-Sosa,\r\nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.    \r\n\nSeptember 14, 1998\r\n\n                                                  Per Curiam.  In these two companion cases, appellants\r\nchallenge their convictions and/or sentences imposed following\r\ntheir guilty pleas to conspiring to distribute cocaine and\r\ncrack and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug\r\ntrafficking offense.  We affirm appellants' convictions and\r\nsentences.\r\n          I. Appeal No. 98-1052.  \r\n          Counsel for Luis Madera-Castro has submitted an\r\nAnders brief and motion to withdraw, asserting that there are\r\nno meritorious issues to be raised on appeal. See Anders v.\r\nState of California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967); 1st Cir. Loc. R.\r\n46.4(a)(4).  Defendant has not filed a separate brief, although\r\nhe has been informed of his right to do so.  We conducted a\r\nfull examination of the proceedings, including the guilty plea\r\nand sentencing hearings, as required by Anders. Based on that\r\nexamination, we agree with counsel that the appeal presents no\r\nissue having an arguable basis in law or fact.\r\n          The transcript of the change of plea hearing\r\ndemonstrates that the district court fully complied with Fed.\r\nR. Crim. P. 11, by properly advising defendant of his rights\r\nand insuring that the plea was voluntary.  The undisputed facts\r\nsupport defendant's conviction of the crimes charged.  The\r\ncourt properly applied the sentencing guidelines and imposed a\r\nsentence at the low end of the applicable guideline\r\nimprisonment range.  Therefore, there are no arguable appellate\r\nissues as to defendant's conviction, plea or sentence.\r\n          Counsel's motion to withdraw is granted, and\r\nappellant's conviction and sentence are affirmed.\r\n          II. Appeal No. 98-1053.\r\n          Pedro Carrera-Gonzalez appeals from his sentence\r\nimposed as to Count One of the indictment.  He does not seek to\r\nvacate his guilty plea.  Having stipulated in his plea\r\nagreement to a drug quantity yielding a base offense level\r\n(\"BOL\") of 24 and to a two-level upward adjustment pursuant to\r\nU.S.S.G.  3B1.4, for the use of a minor to commit the offense,\r\nappellant now objects for the first time that there is\r\ninsufficient factual support for the same.  He concedes that\r\nthe failure to raise either claim below mandates \"plain error\"\r\nreview. See Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); United States v. Olano, 507\r\nU.S. 725 (1993).\r\n          A. Drug Quantity.  A preponderance-of-the-evidence\r\nstandard applies to the sentencing court's determination of\r\ndrug quantity. See United States v. Lindia, 82 F.3d 1154, 1161\r\n(1st Cir. 1996).  Carrera-Gonzalez contends that the district\r\ncourt erred by determining drug quantity in reliance solely  \r\nupon the amounts of drugs charged in the indictment and\r\nstipulated to in the plea agreement.  See Appellant's Brief, p.\r\n10.\r\n          The Sentencing Guidelines provide that the sentencing\r\ncourt \"is not bound by [a] stipulation [of fact], but may with\r\nthe aid of the presentence report, determine the facts relevant\r\nto sentencing.\" U.S.S.G.  6B1.4(d), p.s. (Nov. 1995).  \"Even\r\nthough stipulations are expected to be accurate and complete,\r\nthe court cannot rely exclusively upon stipulations in\r\nascertaining the factors relevant to the determination of\r\nsentence.  Rather, in determining the factual basis for the\r\nsentence, the court will consider the stipulation, together\r\nwith the results of the presentence investigation, and any\r\nother relevant information.\" U.S.S.G.  6B1.4, comment.\r\n          In this case, the district court did not rely\r\nexclusively on the stipulation in the plea agreement in\r\ndetermining drug quantity.  The court also relied upon the\r\npresentence report.  The PSR recounted the government's version\r\nof the facts: that between July 2, 1996 and July 18, 1996,\r\nCarrera-Gonzalez sold drugs in an amount of at least 400 grams,\r\nbut not more than 500 grams. See PSR, p. 5.  At the sentencing\r\nhearing, defense counsel indicated that there were no\r\nobjections to the \"excellent presentence report.\" Sent. Tr., p.\r\n2.  Having failed to object below to the PSR's findings,\r\nCarrera-Gonzalez is bound by them.  See United States v.\r\nBenjamin, 30 F.3d 196, 197 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\n          The court accepted the PSR as its findings of fact,\r\nas permitted by Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(b)(6)(D). In reliance upon\r\nthe PSR's findings regarding the quantity of drugs sold by\r\nCarrera-Gonzalez, the district court properly calculated a BOL\r\nof 24. See United States v. Brewster, 127 F.3d 22, 28 (1st Cir.\r\n1997) (\"[F]actual averments contained in the PSI Report usually\r\nare deemed reliable enough to be used for sentencing\r\npurposes\").  Under these circumstances, the district court's\r\ndetermination of drug quantity was not plain error.\r\n          B. Section 3B1.4 Enhancement.\r\n          The applicability of  3B1.4 is determined by\r\nreference to \"relevant conduct.\"  See U.S.S.G.  1B1.3(a). \r\nTherefore, contrary to appellant's assertion in his brief, the\r\ntwo-level increase did not require a finding that a minor was\r\nused in the sales made by appellant himself.  Instead, the\r\nquestion is whether the use of minors was a \"reasonably\r\nforeseeable act[] . . . of others in furtherance of the jointly\r\nundertaken criminal activity.\"  U.S.S.G.  1B1.3(a)(1)(B).  The\r\nrecord contains ample evidence to support a finding that the\r\nuse of minors was \"reasonably foreseeable.\"  Therefore, it was\r\nnot plain error for the district court to apply the two-level\r\nenhancement under U.S.S.G.  3B1.4, as stipulated to by\r\nappellant.\r\n          Carrera-Gonzalez' sentence is affirmed.
