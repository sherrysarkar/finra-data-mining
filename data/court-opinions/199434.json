The petitions for review in\n\nthis case challenge orders of the Federal Energy Regulatory\n\nCommission (\"FERC\") that have the effect of reinstituting an\n\nearlier   charge--the        so-called    installed   capability   (\"ICAP\")\n\ndeficiency charge--paid by electric utilities in New England who\n\nfail to meet certain reserve capacity requirements.              This court\n\nstayed implementation of all but a small portion of the charge\n\npending judicial review.         The background is complicated but can\n\nbe summarized as follows.\n\n          In New England, as in other regions of the country,\n\nelectrical power is furnished through a grid of interconnected\n\nintercity transmission lines and local distribution lines within\n\neach city or town.           Power is generated within the region, or\n\npurchased from outside (e.g., from Canada).                Some utilities\n\nengage    in    all     three       functions     (generation,     intercity\n\ntransmission,        local    distribution);       but   many    are   local\n\n\"retailers\"    who    own    only   the   local   distribution   facilities\n\nwithin a town and purchase all of their needs from generating\n\nutilities that have surplus power.1\n\n\n    1About 130 utilities in New England are members of New\nEngland Power Pool (\"NEPOOL\"), a voluntary association formed in\n1971 to facilitate the pooling of power and the coordination of\nconstruction and maintenance of generating facilities. New Eng.\nPower Pool, 79 FERC ¶ 61,374, at 62,576 (1997); New Eng. Power\nPool, 50 FERC ¶ 61,139, at 61,419-20 (1990). In 1997, NEPOOL\nobtained FERC approval for the creation of an \"independent\n\n                                      -4-\n\f             Regulation is divided between FERC and state regulatory\n\ncommissions, but generally speaking, FERC regulates wholesale\n\ntransactions (e.g., between a power-supplying utility with a\n\nsurplus and a local municipal utility that retails power).            16\n\nU.S.C. § 824(b)(1) (1994); FPC v. Conway Corp., 426 U.S. 271,\n\n276-77 (1976).       In the past, power was provided largely on a\n\nnon-competitive basis with regulated rates based upon costs;\n\nbut, as in other industries like telecommunications, some power\n\nregulators, including FERC, have been moving in recent years\n\ntoward more reliance upon competition.       Town of Norwood v. FERC,\n\n202 F.3d 392, 396 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 121 S. Ct. 57\n\n(2000).\n\n             An abiding concern in regulating electricity supply is\n\nthe   need    for   adequate   reserve   capacity.   The    demand   for\n\nelectricity varies, depending on weather, economic growth, and\n\nother factors; supply is constrained by the time needed to build\n\nnew generating plants and by unexpected breakdowns in generation\n\nor transmission facilities; and electricity cannot economically\n\nbe stored for future use in large quantities.              To avoid the\n\nextraordinary disruption of blackouts, regulators and utilities\n\n\n\nsystem operator,\" ISO New England, Inc. (\"ISO-NE\"), a non-profit\ncompany that manages New England's power grid and wholesale\nelectricity marketplace pursuant to a contract with NEPOOL. New\nEng. Power Pool, 79 FERC ¶ 61,374, at 62,577-79.\n\n                                   -5-\n\fcalculate reserve requirements based on estimates of how much\n\ngenerating capacity will be needed at the highest point of the\n\npeak load.\n\n            Our case concerns the mechanism for assuring that\n\nutilities will have the reserve power needed to satisfy peak\n\ndemand.     Because the system as a whole must be built to satisfy\n\npeak demand, a good deal of generating capacity is destined to\n\nlie idle at least some of the time.                A prudent utility that\n\nretails power to local customers will purchase from a generating\n\nutility   a   certain     amount    of    reserve     capacity--in    effect,\n\ncapacity that is reserved for that retailer but may be used only\n\nrarely.     But it is not certain that under present industry\n\nconditions    the     retailer    has   adequate    economic    incentive   to\n\npurchase all the reserve capacity that it needs.               And if reserve\n\ncapacity is not purchased in sufficient amounts, generating\n\nutilities may lack the incentive to build as much capacity as is\n\nneeded to supply peak demand.\n\n            The incentive structure in the industry is immensely\n\ncomplicated and economists take different views on how best\n\n(i.e., cheaply and reliably) to secure adequate reserves.                But,\n\nfor a number of years prior to 1998, FERC and the New England\n\nutilities     under    its    supervision      used   the   so-called    ICAP\n\ndeficiency    charge     as   a   device      to   assure   that   purchasing\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\futilities would buy adequate reserve capacity to cover projected\n\npeak load plus a reserve margin.         ISO New Eng., Inc., 91 FERC ¶\n\n61,311, at 62,080 (2000); see also Municipalities of Groton v.\n\nFERC, 587 F.2d 1296, 1302 (D.C. Cir. 1978).\n\n          In   New   England,    beginning     some    time   before    1990,\n\nwholesale tariffs specified that load serving entities (\"LSEs\")-\n\n-crudely, electricity retailers--had to pay a charge if they did\n\nnot purchase enough reserve capacity.              From 1990 onward, the\n\ncharge   was    $8.75   per     kilowatt-month;       thus,   if   during   a\n\nparticular period the reserves purchased by an LSE fell below\n\nits allocated share of all needed reserves, the LSE paid the\n\nspecified charge times the amount of its deficiency.               Through a\n\ncomplicated    arrangement,     most    of   the   money   went    as   extra\n\ncompensation to power-supplying utilities, supplementing the\n\namounts they earned by selling electrical power and committing\n\nreserve capacity.\n\n          The theory underlying the $8.75 figure, which prevailed\n\nin New England from 1990 to 1998, was that it approximated the\n\ncost (appropriately amortized) to construct a kilowatt-month of\n\nnew generating capacity available for peak demand conditions,\n\nplus an additional \"penalty.\"2         The penalty's theoretical basis\n\n\n    2Until 1998, the total ICAP deficiency charge implemented by\nthe New England Power Pool (\"NEPOOL\") consisted of an automatic\n$6 per kilowatt-month \"adjustment charge\" and a possible $2.75\n\n                                   -7-\n\fis not crystal clear, but the existence and value of the penalty\n\nare not    issues in this case.        The key issue is whether FERC,\n\nafter allowing the $8.75 charge to be abandoned in New England\n\nin 1998 and 1999, could reinstate it in 2000 in the way that it\n\ndid.\n\n            In 1998, New England utilities obtained FERC's approval\n\nto abandon the flat ICAP deficiency charge in favor of a so-\n\ncalled auction market for buying additional reserve capacity,\n\nthat is, required capacity over and above that acquired through\n\nbilateral contracts (which are common and often long-term).\n\nHowever, the auction market appears not to have been successful-\n\n-among    other   things,   the    prices   were   thought   to   have   been\n\nsubject to manipulation.          In March 2000, ISO New England, Inc.\n\n(\"ISO-NE\")--the \"independent system operator\" that manages power\n\ntransactions on behalf of the utilities in the New England Power\n\nPool--sought FERC's consent to an end to the auction regime.\n\n            On June 28, 2000, FERC released a lengthy order (\"the\n\nJune 28 order\") that largely addressed other ISO-NE issues but\n\n\n\nper kilowatt-month \"deficiency charge,\" the latter charge being\nwaivable if NEPOOL found that a utility's deficiency was beyond\nits reasonable control.    ISO New Eng., 91 FERC ¶ 61,311, at\n62,080 & n.94; New Eng. Power Pool, 50 FERC ¶ 61,139, at 61,420.\nThe automatic $6 charge was apparently intended to approximate\nthe cost of an appropriate generator with transmission\nfacilities, and the discretionary $2.75 charge apparently\nrepresented an added penalty.\n\n                                     -8-\n\fwhich    toward   its    end    addressed   the   ICAP   issue   in   a   few\n\nparagraphs, ISO New Eng., 91 FERC ¶ 61,311, at 62,080-81.                  In\n\nthe order, FERC agreed with ISO-NE that the auction did not\n\nwork, but, because ISO-NE had not proposed an alternative means\n\nto ensure that LSEs would purchase adequate reserve capacity,\n\nFERC said that although it would permit an end to the auction as\n\nof August 1, 2000, it would \"also require the ISO to revert to\n\nadministratively-determined sanctions for failure [of LSEs] to\n\nmeet the existing ICAP requirement,\" i.e., the projected reserve\n\ncapacity requirement.          Id. at 62,081.     ISO-NE was directed to\n\nfile tariffs \"proposing an appropriate ICAP deficiency charge\n\nwithin 30 days.\"        Id.\n\n           ISO-NE responded with a filing that proposed a charge\n\nof $0.17--a fraction (less than 2 percent) of the charge that\n\nhad prevailed from 1990 to 1998; this figure was proffered as an\n\naverage price paid for power during 1999 on the now abandoned\n\nauction market.         Various utilities who supply surplus power\n\nprotested bitterly; they not only challenged the proposal as\n\nunsupported but said that if adopted this minimal figure would\n\nbecome a de facto cap on prices in the bilateral-contract market\n\nin which much of the reserve capacity is purchased, further\n\nreducing incentives for generating utilities to construct new\n\nplant.\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f           On December 15, 2000, FERC issued a fourteen-paragraph\n\norder (\"the December 15 order\") rejecting the proposed $0.17\n\ncharge.    FERC brushed aside this figure as \"a token payment,\"\n\nsaying that use of the auction average was not appropriate.                   ISO\n\nNew Eng., Inc., 93 FERC ¶ 61,290, at 61,974-75 (2000).                       FERC\n\nthen   ordered   reinstatement       of    the    original    $8.75    figure,\n\neffective August 1, 2000, until ISO-NE proposed some other\n\nadequate   regime.      FERC       said    that    $8.75     \"represents       an\n\napproximation    of   the   cost    to    install    a   peaking      unit   and\n\nrepresents a reasonable basis for setting a level to incent the\n\nconstruction of new generation.\"           Id. at 61,975.\n\n           Petitions for rehearing followed, and FERC deferred the\n\n$8.75 charge pending their disposition.             On March 6, 2001, FERC\n\nissued a decision on reconsideration (\"the March 6 order\"),\n\nrejecting the petitions with one qualification.                ISO New Eng.,\n\nInc., 94 FERC ¶ 61,237, at 61,846-47 (2001).               After elaborating\n\non its reasons for disallowing the $0.17 charge and requiring a\n\nreturn to the $8.75 level, FERC said that it would make the\n\nhigher charge effective only from April 1, 2001, onward; because\n\nof intervening reliance on the $0.17 figure, it would be used\n\nfor payments from August 1, 2000, through March 31, 2001.                    Id.\n\n           Various utilities then petitioned for review in this\n\ncourt, and other utilities intervened on both sides.                  16 U.S.C.\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\f§ 825l(b).      This court then granted petitioners' motion to stay\n\nthe $8.75 charge pendente lite and expedited briefing.                   As the\n\nstay order permitted, FERC then ordered the $0.17 charge to\n\ncontinue in effect pending this court's review.                  Briefing and\n\noral       argument    in    this   court     followed.     In   this    court,\n\npetitioners and others who support them principally attack the\n\nadoption of the $8.75 charge and, secondarily, the rejection of\n\nISO-NE's proposed $0.17 charge.             The standard of review varies,\n\nof course, with the particular claim of error.3\n\n              On review, petitioners’ main assault is on FERC’s\n\nimposition of the $8.75 charge.                They do not contest FERC’s\n\nstatutory      power    to    adopt   an    ICAP   charge   pursuant     to   its\n\nauthority to set just and reasonable rates for wholesale power,\n\n16 U.S.C. §§ 824(b)(1), 824e(a) (1994); but they say that the\n\n$8.75 charge is not supported by substantial evidence.                  We begin\n\nwith this claim and consider, in later sections, related claims\n\nthat FERC failed to consider reasonable alternatives and that\n\n\n\n       3\n     The conventional rule is that general issues of law are\nconsidered de novo. Boston Edison Co. v. FERC, 856 F.2d 361,\n363 (1st Cir. 1988). Agency reasoning or lack of it is tested\nunder the arbitrary and capricious standard, 5 U.S.C. §\n706(2)(A) (1994); and raw findings of fact are sustained if\nsupported by substantial evidence, 16 U.S.C. § 825l(b); accord\n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(E). Boston Edison Co. v. FERC, 885 F.2d 962,\n964 (1st Cir. 1989). Variations exist under some schemes, and\nnumerous subordinate rules of administrative law bear on review.\nE.g., SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 196 (1947).\n\n                                       -11-\n\fthe orders are procedurally flawed (above all, by the lack of an\n\nevidentiary hearing).\n\n             The Basis for the $8.75 Charge.     Although petitioners'\n\ncaption refers to a lack of substantial evidence for adopting\n\nthe $8.75 charge, their attack is actually a multi-faceted\n\nchallenge to FERC’s reasoning, substantive judgments, alleged\n\nmisstatements     and   asserted   failures    to   discuss    issues   or\n\nevidence.     There is, indeed, a good deal to criticize in FERC's\n\norders, and we conclude that       further proceedings are necessary.\n\nHowever, the criticisms can be understood and assessed only\n\nagainst the background of FERC’s basic rationale for adopting\n\nthe $8.75 charge, and it is useful to set forth at the outset\n\nour understanding of what FERC did and why it did it.\n\n             As already noted, FERC long ago approved an ICAP charge\n\nfor the New England area to cope with what it conceives to be a\n\nneed   to    assure   adequate   plant    construction   and   margin   of\n\nreserves.     Such ICAP charges are used in the New York region and\n\nin the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland area; how the matter is\n\nhandled away from the east coast is less clear.                See note 5\n\nbelow.      FERC has been moving federal energy regulation toward\n\nmore competition, but the transition is far from complete, and\n\nno one knows for certain whether special incentives will be\n\nneeded indefinitely or what kind would work best.\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\f              Against this background, FERC has insisted that reserve\n\nrequirements be maintained but, in 1998 and 1999, it allowed\n\nISO-NE     to   substitute    a     short-term        auction   market    as    an\n\nenforcement device.      That scheme, it appears, did not work and\n\npetitioners do not contend otherwise.                 So FERC simply restored\n\nthe pre-existing $8.75 ICAP charge for the time being while\n\nmaking clear that it was open to other proposals from ISO-NE or\n\nothers for a better way to assure adequate reserves.                      In the\n\nabstract, there is nothing in this rationale that is startling,\n\nlet   alone     irrational;   but    the     devil,    as   usual,   is   in   the\n\ndetails.\n\n              First, petitioners attack FERC’s statement that $8.75\n\n\"represents an approximation of the cost to install a peaking\n\n[generating] unit.\"       In fact, say petitioners, FERC has not\n\ncited \"even one iota of evidence in support of this fact-\n\nintensive assertion\" and the highest figure that \"even the\n\nproponents of the $8.75 charge could muster [in affidavits] . .\n\n. was $5.\"      Petitioners may be correct on the numbers, but the\n\nproblem is with FERC’s verbal sloppiness rather than any more\n\nfundamental defect.\n\n              As petitioners know perfectly well, the $8.75 figure\n\nwas, even when adopted years ago, an overstatement of the cost\n\nof a peaking unit; the record before FERC in these proceedings\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\festablished that in 1990 the peaking unit cost was estimated at\n\nabout $5 and the balance, and certainly the balance above $6,\n\nsee note 2 above, therefore represented a further \"penalty\"\n\ncharge with a different rationale, see New Eng. Power Pool\n\nAgreement, 56 FPC 1562, 1599-1600 (1976),                      petition for rev.\n\ndenied sub nom. Municipalities of Groton v. FERC, 587 F.2d 1296\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1978).4       Petitioners do not even explicitly address,\n\nlet alone challenge, the rationale for the additional \"penalty\"\n\ncharge.\n\n            Thus, it is apparent that when FERC called the $8.75\n\ncharge    \"the   cost\"   of    a    peaking      unit,    it   was    adopting    the\n\noriginal    rationale     as       well    as    the     original     figure,     but\n\ncarelessly simplifying the rationale.                    This is a venial sin\n\nexcept so far as it symbolizes FERC’s broader failure to address\n\ncarefully and fully objections to a rate change--the forced re-\n\nadoption of the original $8.75 charge--that                       might increase\n\nlocal    electrical   rates        in   New   England     by   many    millions    of\n\ndollars annually.\n\n            Admittedly, the actual impact of the $8.75 charge on\n\nretail electric rates in New England is not certain--despite\n\n\n    4Before the creation of ISO-NE, the further penalty was not\neven paid to the sellers of power to encourage further\nconstruction but was paid to the New England Power Pool to\ndefray its operating expenses. New Eng. Power Pool, 50 FERC ¶\n61,139, at 61,420 (1990).\n\n                                          -14-\n\fdire predictions from retailing utilities.                      The ICAP charge is\n\npaid only if an LSE fails to buy adequate reserve capacity in\n\nadvance; the      charge, including the penalty, is the spur to do\n\nso.   So if LSEs comply with their obligations through bilateral\n\ncontracts,    there        remains      a    question      as     to    how   much     the\n\nbackground    ICAP    charge     will       drive   up     retail       prices   in    New\n\nEngland.     In any event, FERC's description of $8.75 as an\n\napproximation of generation costs is not a serious problem,\n\nunless actual peaking costs are shown to have fallen (an issue\n\nto which we return below).\n\n            Petitioners' second claim of error is more basic.\n\nPetitioners point to FERC’s central determination that $8.75\n\nrepresents \"a reasonable basis for setting a level to incent\n\n[i.e.,   create      the   incentive        for]    the     construction         of    new\n\ngeneration.\"      They then say that ISO-NE showed that there was\n\nenough planned construction in New England to provide adequate\n\nreserves    without    the   charge;         that   FERC     did       not   respond    to\n\naffidavit showings by opponents that the charge was unnecessary;\n\nthat there is nothing to show that a charge above $0.17 is\n\nneeded; and that merely to point to the prior $8.75 charge is\n\ninsufficient      given    the   lapse       in     time    and     changes      in    the\n\nindustry.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\f           These contentions have more force than FERC admits but\n\nless than petitioners pretend.             As to whether any charge is\n\nneeded,    FERC says on appeal that this issue is not properly\n\npresented because it was decided by FERC in its June 28 order\n\nand judicial review from that order has not been sought.               But\n\nthe reason review has not been sought is that petitions for\n\nrehearing were filed at FERC and FERC has still not acted upon\n\nthem.     We doubt that an agency can use a prior order as a\n\npremise   for   a     drastic   second   step--a   possibly   multimillion\n\ndollar rate increase--but insulate the premise from review by\n\nfailing   to    act    on   rehearing    petitions.     Cf.    Competitive\n\nTelecomms. Ass'n v. FCC, 87 F.3d 522, 531 (D.C. Cir. 1996).\n\n           In all events, the question whether any charge is\n\nneeded overlaps with the further questions whether a substantial\n\ncharge is needed and whether $8.75, $0.17 or some other figure\n\nshould be used.        This last question, at least, was not decided\n\nin the June 28 order; indeed, it arose in response to that\n\norder.    Nor did FERC make in the June 28 order any detailed\n\nfindings of a kind that might control at the second stage, the\n\nsetting of an interim charge.        In short, FERC’s \"jurisdictional\"\n\nobjection to our consideration of the claimed error is hollow.\n\n           On the other hand, petitioners’ own claims on the\n\nmerits are overstated.          That ISO-NE says reserves are adequate\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fwithout a charge proves little:                  it appears that most of the\n\nutilities served by ISO-NE are net buyers and have a self-\n\ninterested incentive to object to a charge.                  And even if present\n\n\"plans\" promise ample new construction, FERC's orders (bolstered\n\nby affidavits presented below) apparently reflect the reasonable\n\nview that plans are only that and can easily be affected by the\n\nprospect that reserve requirements for buyers will or will not\n\nhave teeth.      If a buying utility can purchase below its reserve\n\nrequirement without penalty, it may find it worthwhile to do so\n\nmost of the time--while counting on the system to bail it out in\n\na crisis.\n\n            The more difficult question concerns FERC’s failure to\n\ndiscuss   in    any       detail    the    extensive      affidavit    filings      by\n\nobjectors      who       claim   that--given     the    current     state    of    the\n\nindustry and conditions in New England--no substantial charge or\n\nat least none greater than $0.17 is needed.                         Some of these\n\nfilings   are       by    recognized      experts   and    are    substantial      and\n\ndetailed;      and       although   there     are      counter-affidavits         from\n\nutilities who are presumably net sellers, this is the kind of\n\nmaterial that one would normally expect an agency to analyze\n\nseriously      in    its     decision     before    making       drastic    changes,\n\nespecially where millions of dollars may ride on the outcome.\n\nE.g., Noram Gas Transmission Co. v. FERC, 148 F.3d 1158, 1162-65\n\n\n                                          -17-\n\f(D.C. Cir. 1998); K N Energy, Inc. v. FERC, 968 F.2d 1295, 1302-\n\n04 (D.C. Cir. 1992).\n\n            Yet this case is not the typical one in which something\n\ndrastic    is   being    done   for    the     first     time.     The   reserve\n\nrequirements     have    long   existed       in   New   England   and   are   not\n\ndirectly challenged by petitioners.                And enforcement through a\n\nsubstantial ICAP charge (indeed, from 1990 on with the precise\n\n$8.75 figure) had been standard practice in New England for over\n\na decade before the temporary use of an auction in 1998 and 1999\n\nwhich was either a failure (as FERC found) or at least not\n\nsuccessful enough for petitioners to defend in this court.                      So\n\nFERC’s best answer is that the real status quo ante is the $8.75\n\nfigure    and   that    the   burden   was     really    upon    petitioners    to\n\njustify a departure (i.e., no charge or something less than\n\n$8.75).\n\n            No one has cited any case law closely in point, but\n\ncommon sense suggests the answer.                  FERC did not in the first\n\ninstance have to provide additional justification either for the\n\nneed for a substantial charge or for the $8.75 figure; but given\n\nthe detailed arguments in opposition and the possible dollar\n\nimpact of reinstatement of the $8.75 charge, it owed petitioners\n\n(and the public who will likely pay some of any ICAP charge\n\nthrough passed-on retail rate increases) some explanation as to\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fwhy FERC was not persuaded by petitioners’ efforts to discredit\n\nthe notion of a substantial charge in general or the $8.75\n\ncharge in particular.\n\n          Undoubtedly FERC was annoyed, perhaps rightly, when its\n\ndirection to ISO-NE to reinstitute an administrative charge was\n\nmet by a proposal that FERC regarded as risible:     a figure that\n\nwas a tiny fraction of the prior charge and of the ICAP charges\n\nprevailing elsewhere on the Atlantic coast.5        And given the\n\nimpact of any widespread power shortage, FERC has every reason\n\nto want effective enforcement of reserve requirements, even if\n\nenforcement comes at a high price.     Still, FERC is not therefore\n\nexcused   from   explaining   its   actions.   Addressing    contrary\n\narguments is part of establishing public acceptability and, in\n\nany event, is part of FERC’s own responsibility.            See Motor\n\nVehicle Mfrs. Ass'n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.\n\nCo., 463 U.S. 29, 42-44, 48-50 (1983).\n\n\n\n    5The \"installed capacity\" deficiency charge in the New York\nmarket was $12.50 per kilowatt-month in the year 2000, although\nfor the summer of 2000 the value of the charge was effectively\nreduced to $8.75 per kilowatt-month by a rebate of up to $3.75\nper kilowatt-month. N.Y. Indep. Sys. Operator, Inc., 93 FERC ¶\n61,034, at 61,077-78 (2000). In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-\nMaryland market (\"PJM\"), where no penalty is added to the\nestimated cost of adding generation capacity, the charge is\nsubstantially lower; it was apparently $4.87 per kilowatt-month\nin 1997, Pa.-N.J.-Md. Interconnection, 81 FERC ¶ 61,257, at\n62,276 n.197 (1997) (amended Feb. 4, 1998), and, according to\nthe record on appeal, $5.25 per kilowatt-month in 2000.\n\n                                -19-\n\f            What we have said applies as much to the specific\n\nchoice of the $8.75 figure as to the need for a substantial\n\ncharge.     Absent evidence of significant change in construction\n\ncosts, FERC was entitled to revert to the pre-existing figure\n\nrather than justify it afresh in the first instance, cf. S. La.\n\nArea Rate Cases v. FPC, 428 F.2d 407, 433 (5th Cir.),                   cert.\n\ndenied, 400 U.S. 950 (1970); but it was not entitled to ignore\n\nclaims that the cost of peaking facilities is less than it was\n\nin the past.       Such claims have been made in this case; perhaps\n\nthey can be easily answered; or, if lengthy proceedings would be\n\nneeded to do so, FERC may be able to justify restoring the $8.75\n\ncharge on a provisional basis while making the evaluation.                But\n\nsome response from FERC is required.\n\n            An agency's expert judgments are entitled to deference,\n\nespecially where safety concerns are on one side of the balance,\n\nas they are here.        E.g., Chem. Waste Mgmt., Inc. v. U.S. EPA,\n\n869 F.2d 1526, 1538-40 (D.C. Cir. 1989); cf. K N Energy, 968\n\nF.2d at 1303.      If FERC had provided even a semblance of serious\n\ndiscussion    as    to   why   a   substantial   ICAP   charge    was   still\n\nrequired and why the pre-existing figure was the best solution\n\non short notice, quite probably the charge would be sustained\n\noutright.    California’s recent experience is likely irrelevant\n\nas to immediate causes but not as to consequences.               But this is\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\fall the more reason for FERC to write a decision reflecting a\n\nserious look at objections.\n\n         Alternatives.      In addition to attacking the $8.75\n\ncharge as unsupported, petitioners make a series of further\n\narguments,   beginning   with   the    claim   that   FERC   \"failed   to\n\nconsider reasonable alternatives [to the $8.75 charge], which it\n\nwas obligated to do under reasoned decision-making principles.\"\n\nPetitioners say that \"FERC's only response was that it was\n\ninappropriate to consider these alternatives when proposed in a\n\nrehearing request,\" and they contend that this response is\n\ninadequate because rehearing was \"the first time\" in which\n\nparties opposed to the $8.75 charge could propose alternatives.\n\n         Petitioners have markedly overstated any legitimate\n\ngrievance.   Broadly speaking, agencies are expected to consider\n\nreasonable alternatives to proposed actions, Farmers Union Cent.\n\nExch., Inc. v. FERC, 734 F.2d 1486, 1511 (D.C. Cir.),             cert.\n\ndenied, 469 U.S. 1034 (1984); but here FERC did not refuse to\n\nconsider alternatives or rest \"only\" on the failure to present\n\nthe alternatives earlier.       It said that the record did not\n\nprovide a basis to sustain the main alternative urged (i.e.,\n\nusing bilateral contract prices to construct an ICAP charge) and\n\nthat ISO-NE was welcome to formulate alternatives and support\n\n\n\n\n                                -21-\n\fthem in a new filing.              ISO New Eng., 94 FERC ¶ 61,237, at\n\n61,847.\n\n           Furthermore, the sense that agencies should address\n\nalternatives before acting is not hard and fast:                         if prompt\n\naction    is   necessary     and    delay    would     be   harmful,      agencies\n\nsometimes do need to take interim action, deferring to further\n\nproceedings other facets of the problem or alternative solutions\n\nthat may take more time to develop.                See Competitive Telecomms.\n\nAss'n,    87   F.3d   at    531;    Nat'l    Air    Carrier      Ass'n   v.    Civil\n\nAeronautics Bd., 436 F.2d 185, 194-95 (D.C. Cir. 1970).                            And,\n\nfor multiple reasons in this case, there is nothing unreasonable\n\nin   FERC's     demand     that     proponents        furnish      the    proposed\n\nalternatives with adequate support.\n\n           It is quite true that FERC should have said more to\n\nexplain why it concluded that \"the record in this proceeding\n\ndoes not contain adequate information to support a just and\n\nreasonable     ICAP   deficiency      charge       based    on   prices       in    the\n\nbilateral market.\"         ISO New Eng., 94 FERC ¶ 61,237, at 61,847.\n\nThis is so even if we assume, with FERC, that petitioners could\n\nhave pointed to such alternatives before the December 15 order,\n\nknowing that protests to the earlier compliance filing had urged\n\nthat the $8.75 charge be re-adopted.                But FERC did address the\n\nmain alternative and found it wanting even if FERC's explanation\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\fwas too cryptic; the alternative was not rejected simply because\n\nit was belatedly offered.\n\n         In all events, on remand FERC should explain why, on\n\nthis record, the bilateral-market prices are not an adequately\n\nsupported substitute.   If other substantial alternatives were\n\npresented,   FERC should also address them.   But we harbor some\n\ndoubts about the strength of petitioners' claim as to other\n\nalternatives; it is hard in their briefs to find any substantial\n\ndiscussion of what the alternatives were and why (absent the\n\n$8.75 charge) they might be expected effectively to enforce the\n\nreserve obligations that already exist.\n\n         The $0.17 Charge.   This brings us to petitioners’ next\n\nobjection, which is superficially quite different because it\n\nfocuses on the rejection of the $0.17 charge rather than the\n\nadoption of the $8.75 charge.        Although petitioners do not\n\ncontest FERC's general authority to review the $0.17 charge, 16\n\nU.S.C. §§ 824d, 824e (1994), they say that under established\n\ncase law, FERC had no power to \"reject\" ISO-NE's $0.17 proposal\n\nwithout a \"hearing\" because it was not procedurally deficient or\n\nsubstantively a \"nullity,\" Mun. Light Bds. v. FPC, 450 F.2d\n\n1341, 1345 (D.C. Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 989 (1972).\n\nPetitioners also say that the reasons given by FERC for the\n\nrejection were unsound or unsupported.\n\n\n                              -23-\n\f               There is a body of case law, not entirely consistent\n\nin rhetoric or substance, that limits the power of federal\n\nratemaking agencies like FERC summarily to reject new tariffs\n\nexcept as to narrow grounds.6               The case law is a gloss on\n\nstatutory procedures designed to allow carriers to institute\n\nrate       changes   on   their   own   initiative    and,   subject     both   to\n\ntemporary       delay     or   \"suspension\"     and   to   refund   of    later-\n\noverturned obligations, to place new rates into effect during\n\nagency investigation and hearing.               E.g., AT&T Co. v. FCC, 487\n\nF.2d 865, 871-72 (2d Cir. 1973).               But the $0.17 charge was not\n\njust a typical utility-initiated rate charge but was purportedly\n\nfiled in compliance with FERC's June 28 order.\n\n               Here, FERC says that the $0.17 rate was inconsistent\n\nwith its June 28 order and that that order cannot be attacked in\n\nthis proceeding.          The two propositions are quite different.             We\n\nhave already explained why the premises of the June 28 order\n\ncannot be insulated from criticism insofar as those premises are\n\nused to support FERC’s later actions.                 However, the fact that\n\nthe June 28 order is still before FERC on rehearing petitions\n\n\n\n       6\n      E.g., ANR Pipeline Co. v.

The June 28 order was effective unless\n\nstayed, and no stay was secured either from FERC or from a\n\nreviewing court.\n\n            According to FERC’s December 15 order rejecting the\n\nproposal, the $0.17 charge was a nominal rather than a plausible\n\nresponse to the June 28 directive.        If FERC was correct, it was\n\nentitled to reject the filing as patently inconsistent with an\n\nexisting, unstayed directive. \"[A] utility is not entitled to a\n\nhearing before the non-conforming portion of its rate filing is\n\nrejected or when it challenges an established policy,\" Jersey\n\nCent.

Cir. 1983)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                                   -25-\n\f           In critiquing the determination, petitioners focus on\n\na terse and arguably confusing statement by FERC that the $0.17\n\nwas merely an average derived from the (now abandoned) auction\n\nmarket and was not \"useful.\"           Yet, fairly read, FERC's June 28\n\norder clearly envisaged a return to a substantial ICAP charge;\n\nand the core concept of such a charge has long been in New\n\nEngland, and still is in other Atlantic Coast regions, the cost\n\nof adding new peak load generating capacity (not excluding a\n\npossible penalty as well).            That cost is far above $0.17 and\n\nprobably lies in the $5.00 range.               On this premise, the $0.17\n\nproposal was plainly non-complying, and FERC's rejection of the\n\n$0.17 proposal was therefore well justified.\n\n           Procedural Matters.             Petitioners' final argument on\n\nreview brings them back to FERC’s adoption of the $8.75 charge.\n\nIn   adopting    this   charge,      say   petitioners,    FERC   \"failed    to\n\nprovide due process and unreasonably refused to hold a hearing.\"\n\nTwo quite different arguments are presented under this heading:\n\nfirst, that FERC was required to hold not just a hearing (which\n\nit did) but a specific kind of hearing before adopting the $8.75\n\ncharge;    and   second,      that    because    selling    utilities     first\n\nproposed the $8.75 charge in protesting the $0.17 filing, the\n\nbuying    utilities     had   no   fair    opportunity     to   respond   since\n\n\"[u]nder FERC’s rules, answers to protests are not permitted.\"\n\n\n                                      -26-\n\f              The term \"hearing\" is notoriously malleable, but what\n\npetitioners got here was not only a hearing but a species of\n\nevidentiary hearing8 which is now quite common in utility and\n\ncarrier regulation, e.g., Town of Norwood, 202 F.3d at 404.\n\nVery extensive evidentiary submissions were made by both sides\n\nin the form of affidavits from experts and others, together with\n\nextensive written argument; indeed, it is these submissions by\n\nbuying utilities that petitioners complain (rightly in some\n\ndegree) were before FERC but not seriously addressed in its\n\norders.\n\n              At least where forward-looking industry-wide regulation\n\nis at issue, it is increasingly common for agencies to employ\n\nsuch       hearings    by    affidavit      and   nothing   more.     In   such\n\nsituations, courts have approved of this agency practice when\n\nany genuine issues of material fact can be \"adequately resolved\n\non the written record.\"          E.g., Town of Norwood, 202 F.3d at 404;\n\nLa. Energy & Power Auth. v. FERC, 141 F.3d 364, 371 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1998); see also La. Ass'n of Indep. Producers & Royalty Owners\n\nv.   FERC,     958    F.2d   1101,   1113    (D.C.

It is often said\n\nthat an agency’s decisions as to procedure are reviewed for\n\nabuse of discretion,9 and, again, the reasons for deference are\n\nespecially strong where the decision is entangled with the\n\nagency's expert judgment regarding forward-looking industry-wide\n\nregulation, see, e.g., Fresno Mobile Radio, Inc. v. FCC, 165\n\nF.3d 965, 971 (D.C. Cir. 1999).\n\n            Turning to the question whether buying utilities had\n\na fair opportunity to respond to the prospect of an $8.75\n\ncharge, there are two additional points.               First, in 77 pages of\n\ncomments filed with FERC on August 28, 2000 (the very same day\n\nthat sellers filed protests arguing for the $8.75 charge),\n\nbuying     utilities       specifically     anticipated,        and   responded\n\n\n    9E.g., R&W Technical Servs. Ltd. v. Commodity Futures\nTrading Comm'n, 205 F.3d 165, 176 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 121\nS. Ct. 54 (2000); La. Pub. Serv. Comm'n v. FERC, 184 F.3d 892,\n895 (D.C. Cir. 1999); City of St. Louis v. Dep't of Transp., 936\nF.2d 1528, 1538 (8th Cir. 1991).\n\n                                     -28-\n\fextensively to, arguments for the $8.75 charge.          Thus, under the\n\nparticular     circumstances   of   this   case,   FERC's    general     rule\n\nagainst answers to protests, 18 C.F.R. § 385.213(a)(2) (2000),\n\ndid not prevent buying utilities from presenting the principal\n\narguments against the $8.75 charge.10\n\n              A second, more decisive point is that, whatever the\n\nadequacy of the \"hearing\" provided before December 15, opponents\n\nto the $8.75 charge had ample opportunity to contest the $8.75\n\ncharge in their requests for rehearing.            See Boston Edison Co.\n\nv. FERC, 885 F.2d 962, 966 (1st Cir. 1989).             As noted above,\n\nFERC's March 6 order considered the various arguments against\n\nthe $8.75 charge and responded to them.               The main question\n\nremains not whether petitioners' arguments were heard, but what\n\nFERC should have done to respond to them adequately.\n\n              In all events, on remand petitioners are free to ask\n\nFERC for the opportunity to make further submissions and to show\n\nFERC    why   oral   cross-examination     is   necessary.     As   we    are\n\nstructuring our remand, petitioners will have no incentive for\n\ndelay and good reason for expedition; they can then consider\n\nagain whether they think oral cross-examination is vital.                 And\n\n\n\n       10\n      In the December 15 order, FERC invoked this rule to\njustify refusing to consider a terse five-page answer filed by\none buying utility on September 12, 2000. ISO New Eng., 93 FERC\n¶ 61,290, at 61,974.\n\n                                    -29-\n\fsomething    may    depend    on     how     FERC     proposes    to    answer   the\n\nobjections made to its contemplated $8.75 charge and just how\n\nmuch of an interim measure it intends the $8.75 charge to be.\n\n            Remand.     We conclude that certain specific issues\n\nraised by opponents of the $8.75 charge require more reasoned\n\nconsideration than FERC afforded.                The results of FERC's orders\n\nmay well be defensible, given FERC's view that immediate action\n\nis required and that the charge can be reconsidered if opponents\n\nprovide an adequate alternative regime.                 However, the immediate\n\nimpact of those orders is high and FERC's errors and omissions\n\nare   troubling.      Thus,     a   remand       is   appropriate      for   further\n\nexplanation. Noram Gas, 148 F.3d at 1165-66.\n\n            The principal questions that FERC needs to answer more\n\nfully are these:       why, despite petitioners' various claims to\n\nthe contrary, a substantial ICAP charge is still required to\n\nenforce   reserve     obligations;         why,   in    light    of    petitioners'\n\nclaims of a lower present cost of peaking capacity, $8.75 is the\n\nproper    interim     figure;       and    why    any    alternatives        already\n\nproffered by opponents are inadequate or are otherwise not\n\nproperly considered at this time.                Answers can be imagined, but\n\nit is FERC that must formulate and adopt them in the first\n\ninstance.    SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 196 (1947).\n\n\n\n\n                                          -30-\n\f              A reviewing court that perceives flaws in an agency's\n\nexplanation is not required automatically to set aside the\n\ninadequately      explained        order.         Allied-Signal,     Inc.    v.     U.S.\n\nNuclear Regulatory Comm'n, 988 F.2d 146, 150-51 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1993).     Whether to do so rests in the sound discretion of the\n\nreviewing court; and it depends inter alia on the severity of\n\nthe errors, the likelihood that they can be mended without\n\naltering the order, and on the balance of equities and public\n\ninterest considerations.              Int'l Union, United Mine Workers of\n\nAm. v. Fed. Mine Safety & Health Admin., 920 F.2d 960, 966-67\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1990).       Here, a preliminary assessment suggests that\n\nthe errors at issue can probably be mended.\n\n               Further, FERC's warrant that the charge is needed now\n\nto   assure     adequate      energy   supplies        in    New   England   carries\n\nweight.       FERC has plausibly adverted to the need for confidence\n\namong     power    suppliers        that     reserve    requirements         will     be\n\nmeaningfully enforced.              Cf. Fresno Mobile Radio, 165 F.3d at\n\n971.      An on again-off again ICAP charge is not likely to\n\nencourage      suppliers      to    maintain       marginal    (i.e.,    high     cost)\n\nexisting plant or to build new facilities for peak demand.                            At\n\nleast    at    this   time,    we    think     that    the    public    interest      in\n\nassuring power is decisive.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -31-\n\f              In remanding, we leave open to FERC's informed judgment\n\nthe decision whether to conduct further proceedings (and, if so,\n\nwhat kind) or whether simply to write a further decision on\n\nreconsideration.           Nor do we preclude FERC from modifying the\n\noutcome if it is so advised.                No time limit need be imposed at\n\nthis time.      If FERC unduly delays, any party to this case may\n\napply    to    us    for    an    order     fixing      a    deadline       for    agency\n\nreconsideration.           Cf. Int'l Union, 920 F.2d at 967.\n\n              We retain jurisdiction over this case to issue all\n\norders necessary to assure compliance with our mandate and to\n\nreview    whatever     decision       FERC      makes       on    reconsideration        in\n\nresponse to our mandate, assuming that the decision remains\n\ncontested.

This court stayed implementation of all but a small portion of the charge pending judicial review. The background is complicated but can be summarized as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In New England, as in other regions of the country, electrical power is furnished through a grid of interconnected intercity transmission lines and local distribution lines within each city or town. Power is generated within the region, or purchased from outside (e.g., from Canada). Some utilities engage in all three functions (generation, intercity transmission, local distribution); but many are local \"retailers\" who own only the local distribution facilities within a town and purchase all of their needs from generating utilities that have surplus power.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regulation is divided between FERC and state regulatory commissions, but generally speaking, FERC regulates wholesale transactions (e.g., between a power-supplying utility with a surplus and a local municipal utility that retails power). 16 U.S.C. &#167; 824(b)(1) (1994); FPC v. Conway Corp., 426 U.S. 271, 276-77 (1976). In the past, power was provided largely on a non-competitive basis with regulated rates based upon costs; but, as in other industries like telecommunications, some power regulators, including FERC, have been moving in recent years toward more reliance upon competition. Town of Norwood v. FERC, 202 F.3d 392, 396 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 121 S. Ct. 57 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An abiding concern in regulating electricity supply is the need for adequate reserve capacity. The demand for electricity varies, depending on weather, economic growth, and other factors; supply is constrained by the time needed to build new generating plants and by unexpected breakdowns in generation or transmission facilities; and electricity cannot economically be stored for future use in large quantities. To avoid the extraordinary disruption of blackouts, regulators and utilities calculate reserve requirements based on estimates of how much generating capacity will be needed at the highest point of the peak load.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our case concerns the mechanism for assuring that utilities will have the reserve power needed to satisfy peak demand. Because the system as a whole must be built to satisfy peak demand, a good deal of generating capacity is destined to lie idle at least some of the time. A prudent utility that retails power to local customers will purchase from a generating utility a certain amount of reserve capacity--in effect, capacity that is reserved for that retailer but may be used only rarely. But it is not certain that under present industry conditions the retailer has adequate economic incentive to purchase all the reserve capacity that it needs. And if reserve capacity is not purchased in sufficient amounts, generating utilities may lack the incentive to build as much capacity as is needed to supply peak demand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The incentive structure in the industry is immensely complicated and economists take different views on how best (i.e., cheaply and reliably) to secure adequate reserves. But, for a number of years prior to 1998, FERC and the New England utilities under its supervision used the so-called ICAP deficiency charge as a device to assure that purchasing utilities would buy adequate reserve capacity to cover projected peak load plus a reserve margin. ISO New Eng., Inc., 91 FERC &#182; 61,311, at 62,080 (2000); see also Municipalities of Groton v. FERC, 587 F.2d 1296, 1302 (D.C. Cir. 1978).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In New England, beginning some time before 1990, wholesale tariffs specified that load serving entities (\"LSE's\")--crudely, electricity retailers--had to pay a charge if they did not purchase enough reserve capacity. From 1990 onward, the charge was $8.75 per kilowatt-month; thus, if during a particular period the reserves purchased by an LSE fell below its allocated share of all needed reserves, the LSE paid the specified charge times the amount of its deficiency. Through a complicated arrangement, most of the money went as extra compensation to power-supplying utilities, supplementing the amounts they earned by selling electrical power and committing reserve capacity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The theory underlying the $8.75 figure, which prevailed in New England from 1990 to 1998, was that it approximated the cost (appropriately amortized) to construct a kilowatt-month of new generating capacity available for peak demand conditions, plus an additional \"penalty.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The penalty's theoretical basis is not crystal clear, but the existence and value of the penalty are not issues in this case. The key issue is whether FERC, after allowing the $8.75 charge to be abandoned in New England in 1998 and 1999, could reinstate it in 2000 in the way that it did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1998, New England utilities obtained FERC's approval to abandon the flat ICAP deficiency charge in favor of a so-called auction market for buying additional reserve capacity, that is, required capacity over and above that acquired through bilateral contracts (which are common and often long-term). However, the auction market appears not to have been successful--among other things, the prices were thought to have been subject to manipulation. In March 2000, ISO New England, Inc. (\"ISO-NE\")--the \"independent system operator\" that manages power transactions on behalf of the utilities in the New England Power Pool--sought FERC's consent to an end to the auction regime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 28, 2000, FERC released a lengthy order (\"the June 28 order\") that largely addressed other ISO-NE issues but which toward its end addressed the ICAP issue in a few paragraphs, ISO New Eng., 91 FERC &#182; 61,311, at 62,080-81. In the order, FERC agreed with ISO-NE that the auction did not work, but, because ISO-NE had not proposed an alternative means to ensure that LSE's would purchase adequate reserve capacity, FERC said that although it would permit an end to the auction as of August 1, 2000, it would \"also require the ISO to revert to administratively-determined sanctions for failure [of LSE'S] to meet the existing ICAP requirement,\" i.e., the projected reserve capacity requirement. Id. at 62,081. ISO-NE was directed to file tariffs \"proposing an appropriate ICAP deficiency charge within 30 days.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ISO-NE responded with a filing that proposed a charge of $0.17--a fraction (less than 2 percent) of the charge that had prevailed from 1990 to 1998; this figure was proffered as an average price paid for power during 1999 on the now abandoned auction market. Various utilities who supply surplus power protested bitterly; they not only challenged the proposal as unsupported but said that if adopted this minimal figure would become a de facto cap on prices in the bilateral-contract market in which much of the reserve capacity is purchased, further reducing incentives for generating utilities to construct new plant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 15, 2000, FERC issued a fourteen-paragraph order (\"the December 15 order\") rejecting the proposed $0.17 charge. FERC brushed aside this figure as \"a token payment,\" saying that use of the auction average was not appropriate. ISO New Eng., Inc., 93 FERC &#182; 61,290, at 61,974-75 (2000). FERC then ordered reinstatement of the original $8.75 figure, effective August 1, 2000, until ISO-NE proposed some other adequate regime. FERC said that $8.75 \"represents an approximation of the cost to install a peaking unit and represents a reasonable basis for setting a level to incent the construction of new generation.\" Id. at 61,975.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitions for rehearing followed, and FERC deferred the $8.75 charge pending their disposition. On March 6, 2001, FERC issued a decision on reconsideration (\"the March 6 order\"), rejecting the petitions with one qualification. ISO New Eng., Inc., 94 FERC &#182; 61,237, at 61,846-47 (2001). After elaborating on its reasons for disallowing the $0.17 charge and requiring a return to the $8.75 level, FERC said that it would make the higher charge effective only from April 1, 2001, onward; because of intervening reliance on the $0.17 figure, it would be used for payments from August 1, 2000, through March 31, 2001. Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Various utilities then petitioned for review in this court, and other utilities intervened on both sides. 16 U.S.C. &#167; 825l(b). This court then granted petitioners' motion to stay the $8.75 charge pendente lite and expedited briefing. As the stay order permitted, FERC then ordered the $0.17 charge to continue in effect pending this court's review. Briefing and oral argument in this court followed. In this court, petitioners and others who support them principally attack the adoption of the $8.75 charge and, secondarily, the rejection of ISO-NE's proposed $0.17 charge. The standard of review varies, of course, with the particular claim of error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On review, petitioners' main assault is on FERC's imposition of the $8.75 charge. They do not contest FERC's statutory power to adopt an ICAP charge pursuant to its authority to set just and reasonable rates for wholesale power, 16 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 824(b)(1), 824e(a) (1994); but they say that the $8.75 charge is not supported by substantial evidence. We begin with this claim and consider, in later sections, related claims that FERC failed to consider reasonable alternatives and that the orders are procedurally flawed (above all, by the lack of an evidentiary hearing).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Basis for the $8.75 Charge. Although petitioners' caption refers to a lack of substantial evidence for adopting the $8.75 charge, their attack is actually a multi-faceted challenge to FERC's reasoning, substantive judgments, alleged misstatements and asserted failures to discuss issues or evidence. There is, indeed, a good deal to criticize in FERC's orders, and we conclude that further proceedings are necessary. However, the criticisms can be understood and assessed only against the background of FERC's basic rationale for adopting the $8.75 charge, and it is useful to set forth at the outset our understanding of what FERC did and why it did it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As already noted, FERC long ago approved an ICAP charge for the New England area to cope with what it conceives to be a need to assure adequate plant construction and margin of reserves. Such ICAP charges are used in the New York region and in the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland area; how the matter is handled away from the east coast is less clear. See note 5 below. FERC has been moving federal energy regulation toward more competition, but the transition is far from complete, and no one knows for certain whether special incentives will be needed indefinitely or what kind would work best.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this background, FERC has insisted that reserve requirements be maintained but, in 1998 and 1999, it allowed ISO-NE to substitute a short-term auction market as an enforcement device. That scheme, it appears, did not work and petitioners do not contend otherwise. So FERC simply restored the pre-existing $8.75 ICAP charge for the time being while making clear that it was open to other proposals from ISO-NE or others for a better way to assure adequate reserves. In the abstract, there is nothing in this rationale that is startling, let alone irrational; but the devil, as usual, is in the details.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, petitioners attack FERC's statement that $8.75 \"represents an approximation of the cost to install a peaking [generating] unit.\" In fact, say petitioners, FERC has not cited \"even one iota of evidence in support of this fact-intensive assertion\" and the highest figure that \"even the proponents of the $8.75 charge could muster [in affidavits] . . . was $5.\" Petitioners may be correct on the numbers, but the problem is with FERC's verbal sloppiness rather than any more fundamental defect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As petitioners know perfectly well, the $8.75 figure was, even when adopted years ago, an overstatement of the cost of a peaking unit; the record before FERC in these proceedings established that in 1990 the peaking unit cost was estimated at about $5 and the balance, and certainly the balance above $6, see note 2 above, therefore represented a further \"penalty\" charge with a different rationale, see New Eng. Power Pool Agreement, 56 FPC 1562, 1599-1600 (1976), petition for rev. denied sub nom. Municipalities of Groton v. FERC, 587 F.2d 1296 (D.C. Cir. 1978).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Petitioners do not even explicitly address, let alone challenge, the rationale for the additional \"penalty\" charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, it is apparent that when FERC called the $8.75 charge \"the cost\" of a peaking unit, it was adopting the original rationale as well as the original figure, but carelessly simplifying the rationale. This is a venial sin except so far as it symbolizes FERC's broader failure to address carefully and fully objections to a rate change--the forced re-adoption of the original $8.75 charge--that might increase local electrical rates in New England by many millions of dollars annually.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, the actual impact of the $8.75 charge on retail electric rates in New England is not certain--despite dire predictions from retailing utilities. The ICAP charge is paid only if an LSE fails to buy adequate reserve capacity in advance; the charge, including the penalty, is the spur to do so. So if LSE'S comply with their obligations through bilateral contracts, there remains a question as to how much the background ICAP charge will drive up retail prices in New England. In any event, FERC's description of $8.75 as an approximation of generation costs is not a serious problem, unless actual peaking costs are shown to have fallen (an issue to which we return below).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioners' second claim of error is more basic. Petitioners point to FERC's central determination that $8.75 represents \"a reasonable basis for setting a level to incent [i.e., create the incentive for] the construction of new generation.\" They then say that ISO-NE showed that there was enough planned construction in New England to provide adequate reserves without the charge; that FERC did not respond to affidavit showings by opponents that the charge was unnecessary; that there is nothing to show that a charge above $0.17 is needed; and that merely to point to the prior $8.75 charge is insufficient given the lapse in time and changes in the industry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These contentions have more force than FERC admits but less than petitioners pretend. As to whether any charge is needed, FERC says on appeal that this issue is not properly presented because it was decided by FERC in its June 28 order and judicial review from that order has not been sought. But the reason review has not been sought is that petitions for rehearing were filed at FERC and FERC has still not acted upon them. We doubt that an agency can use a prior order as a premise for a drastic second step--a possibly multimillion dollar rate increase--but insulate the premise from review by failing to act on rehearing petitions. Cf. Competitive Telecomms. Ass'n v. FCC, 87 F.3d 522, 531 (D.C. Cir. 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the question whether any charge is needed overlaps with the further questions whether a substantial charge is needed and whether $8.75, $0.17 or some other figure should be used. This last question, at least, was not decided in the June 28 order; indeed, it arose in response to that order. Nor did FERC make in the June 28 order any detailed findings of a kind that might control at the second stage, the setting of an interim charge. In short, FERC's \"jurisdictional\" objection to our consideration of the claimed error is hollow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, petitioners' own claims on the merits are overstated. That ISO-NE says reserves are adequate without a charge proves little: it appears that most of the utilities served by ISO-NE are net buyers and have a self-interested incentive to object to a charge. And even if present \"plans\" promise ample new construction, FERC's orders (bolstered by affidavits presented below) apparently reflect the reasonable view that plans are only that and can easily be affected by the prospect that reserve requirements for buyers will or will not have teeth. If a buying utility can purchase below its reserve requirement without penalty, it may find it worthwhile to do so most of the time--while counting on the system to bail it out in a crisis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The more difficult question concerns FERC's failure to discuss in any detail the extensive affidavit filings by objectors who claim that--given the current state of the industry and conditions in New England--no substantial charge or at least none greater than $0.17 is needed. Some of these filings are by recognized experts and are substantial and detailed; and although there are counter-affidavits from utilities who are presumably net sellers, this is the kind of material that one would normally expect an agency to analyze seriously in its decision before making drastic changes, especially where millions of dollars may ride on the outcome. E.g., Noram Gas Transmission Co. v. FERC, 148 F.3d 1158, 1162-65 (D.C. Cir. 1998); K N Energy, Inc. v. FERC, 968 F.2d 1295, 1302-04 (D.C. Cir. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet this case is not the typical one in which something drastic is being done for the first time. The reserve requirements have long existed in New England and are not directly challenged by petitioners. And enforcement through a substantial ICAP charge (indeed, from 1990 on with the precise $8.75 figure) had been standard practice in New England for over a decade before the temporary use of an auction in 1998 and 1999 which was either a failure (as FERC found) or at least not successful enough for petitioners to defend in this court. So FERC's best answer is that the real status quo ante is the $8.75 figure and that the burden was really upon petitioners to justify a departure (i.e., no charge or something less than $8.75).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No one has cited any case law closely in point, but common sense suggests the answer. FERC did not in the first instance have to provide additional justification either for the need for a substantial charge or for the $8.75 figure; but given the detailed arguments in opposition and the possible dollar impact of reinstatement of the $8.75 charge, it owed petitioners (and the public who will likely pay some of any ICAP charge through passed-on retail rate increases) some explanation as to why FERC was not persuaded by petitioners' efforts to discredit the notion of a substantial charge in general or the $8.75 charge in particular.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Undoubtedly FERC was annoyed, perhaps rightly, when its direction to ISO-NE to reinstitute an administrative charge was met by a proposal that FERC regarded as risible: a figure that was a tiny fraction of the prior charge and of the ICAP charges prevailing elsewhere on the Atlantic coast.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> And given the impact of any widespread power shortage, FERC has every reason to want effective enforcement of reserve requirements, even if enforcement comes at a high price. Still, FERC is not therefore excused from explaining its actions. Addressing contrary arguments is part of establishing public acceptability and, in any event, is part of FERC's own responsibility. See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 42-44, 48-50 (1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What we have said applies as much to the specific choice of the $8.75 figure as to the need for a substantial charge. Absent evidence of significant change in construction costs, FERC was entitled to revert to the pre-existing figure rather than justify it afresh in the first instance, cf. S. La. Area Rate Cases v. FPC, 428 F.2d 407, 433 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 950 (1970); but it was not entitled to ignore claims that the cost of peaking facilities is less than it was in the past. Such claims have been made in this case; perhaps they can be easily answered; or, if lengthy proceedings would be needed to do so, FERC may be able to justify restoring the $8.75 charge on a provisional basis while making the evaluation. But some response from FERC is required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An agency's expert judgments are entitled to deference, especially where safety concerns are on one side of the balance, as they are here. E.g., Chem. Waste Mgmt., Inc. v. U.S. EPA, 869 F.2d 1526, 1538-40 (D.C. Cir. 1989); cf. K N Energy, 968 F.2d at 1303. If FERC had provided even a semblance of serious discussion as to why a substantial ICAP charge was still required and why the pre-existing figure was the best solution on short notice, quite probably the charge would be sustained outright. California's recent experience is likely irrelevant as to immediate causes but not as to consequences. But this is all the more reason for FERC to write a decision reflecting a serious look at objections.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatives. In addition to attacking the $8.75 charge as unsupported, petitioners make a series of further arguments, beginning with the claim that FERC \"failed to consider reasonable alternatives [to the $8.75 charge], which it was obligated to do under reasoned decision-making principles.\" Petitioners say that \"FERC's only response was that it was inappropriate to consider these alternatives when proposed in a rehearing request,\" and they contend that this response is inadequate because rehearing was \"the first time\" in which parties opposed to the $8.75 charge could propose alternatives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioners have markedly overstated any legitimate grievance. Broadly speaking, agencies are expected to consider reasonable alternatives to proposed actions, Farmers Union Cent. Exch., Inc. v. FERC, 734 F.2d 1486, 1511 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1034 (1984); but here FERC did not refuse to consider alternatives or rest \"only\" on the failure to present the alternatives earlier. It said that the record did not provide a basis to sustain the main alternative urged (i.e., using bilateral contract prices to construct an ICAP charge) and that ISO-NE was welcome to formulate alternatives and support them in a new filing. ISO New Eng., 94 FERC &#182; 61,237, at 61,847.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the sense that agencies should address alternatives before acting is not hard and fast: if prompt action is necessary and delay would be harmful, agencies sometimes do need to take interim action, deferring to further proceedings other facets of the problem or alternative solutions that may take more time to develop. See Competitive Telecomms. Ass'n, 87 F.3d at 531; Nat'l Air Carrier Ass'n v. Civil Aeronautics Bd., 436 F.2d 185, 194-95 (D.C. Cir. 1970). And, for multiple reasons in this case, there is nothing unreasonable in FERC's demand that proponents furnish the proposed alternatives with adequate support.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is quite true that FERC should have said more to explain why it concluded that \"the record in this proceeding does not contain adequate information to support a just and reasonable ICAP deficiency charge based on prices in the bilateral market.\" ISO New Eng., 94 FERC &#182; 61,237, at 61,847. This is so even if we assume, with FERC, that petitioners could have pointed to such alternatives before the December 15 order, knowing that protests to the earlier compliance filing had urged that the $8.75 charge be re-adopted. But FERC did address the main alternative and found it wanting even if FERC's explanation was too cryptic; the alternative was not rejected simply because it was belatedly offered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, on remand FERC should explain why, on this record, the bilateral-market prices are not an adequately supported substitute. If other substantial alternatives were presented, FERC should also address them. But we harbor some doubts about the strength of petitioners' claim as to other alternatives; it is hard in their briefs to find any substantial discussion of what the alternatives were and why (absent the $8.75 charge) they might be expected effectively to enforce the reserve obligations that already exist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The $0.17 Charge. This brings us to petitioners' next objection, which is superficially quite different because it focuses on the rejection of the $0.17 charge rather than the adoption of the $8.75 charge. Although petitioners do not contest FERC's general authority to review the $0.17 charge, 16 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 824d, 824e (1994), they say that under established case law, FERC had no power to \"reject\" ISO-NE's $0.17 proposal without a \"hearing\" because it was not procedurally deficient or substantively a \"nullity,\" Mun. Light Bds. v. FPC, 450 F.2d 1341, 1345 (D.C. Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 989 (1972). Petitioners also say that the reasons given by FERC for the rejection were unsound or unsupported.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a body of case law, not entirely consistent in rhetoric or substance, that limits the power of federal rate making agencies like FERC summarily to reject new tariffs except as to narrow grounds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The case law is a gloss on statutory procedures designed to allow carriers to institute rate changes on their own initiative and, subject both to temporary delay or \"suspension\" and to refund of later-overturned obligations, to place new rates into effect during agency investigation and hearing. E.g., AT&amp;T Co. v. FCC, 487 F.2d 865, 871-72 (2d Cir. 1973). But the $0.17 charge was not just a typical utility-initiated rate charge but was purportedly filed in compliance with FERC's June 28 order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, FERC says that the $0.17 rate was inconsistent with its June 28 order and that that order cannot be attacked in this proceeding. The two propositions are quite different. We have already explained why the premises of the June 28 order cannot be insulated from criticism insofar as those premises are used to support FERC's later actions. However, the fact that the June 28 order is still before FERC on rehearing petitions does not prevent FERC from relying upon it in evaluating a purported compliance filing, which is just what the $0.17 proposal constituted. The June 28 order was effective unless stayed, and no stay was secured either from FERC or from a reviewing court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to FERC's December 15 order rejecting the proposal, the $0.17 charge was a nominal rather than a plausible response to the June 28 directive. If FERC was correct, it was entitled to reject the filing as patently inconsistent with an existing, unstayed directive. \"[A] utility is not entitled to a hearing before the non-conforming portion of its rate filing is rejected or when it challenges an established policy,\" Jersey Cent. Power &amp; Light Co. v. FERC, 810 F.2d 1168, 1205 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (internal citations omitted); see also ANR Pipeline Co. v. FERC, 931 F.2d 88, 92. FERC certainly did make a determination of non-compliance, and in this determination it enjoys a favorable standard of review, Pepperell Assocs. v. U.S. EPA, 246 F.3d 15, 22 (1st Cir. 2001).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Whether FERC adequately explained the determination is a different question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In critiquing the determination, petitioners focus on a terse and arguably confusing statement by FERC that the $0.17 was merely an average derived from the (now abandoned) auction market and was not \"useful.\" Yet, fairly read, FERC's June 28 order clearly envisaged a return to a substantial ICAP charge; and the core concept of such a charge has long been in New England, and still is in other Atlantic Coast regions, the cost of adding new peak load generating capacity (not excluding a possible penalty as well). That cost is far above $0.17 and probably lies in the $5.00 range. On this premise, the $0.17 proposal was plainly non-complying, and FERC's rejection of the $0.17 proposal was therefore well justified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Procedural Matters. Petitioners' final argument on review brings them back to FERC's adoption of the $8.75 charge. In adopting this charge, say petitioners, FERC \"failed to provide due process and unreasonably refused to hold a hearing.\" Two quite different arguments are presented under this heading: first, that FERC was required to hold not just a hearing (which it did) but a specific kind of hearing before adopting the $8.75 charge; and second, that because selling utilities first proposed the $8.75 charge in protesting the $0.17 filing, the buying utilities had no fair opportunity to respond since \"[u]nder FERC's rules, answers to protests are not permitted.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term \"hearing\" is notoriously malleable, but what petitioners got here was not only a hearing but a species of evidentiary hearing<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> which is now quite common in utility and carrier regulation, e.g., Town of Norwood, 202 F.3d at 404. Very extensive evidentiary submissions were made by both sides in the form of affidavits from experts and others, together with extensive written argument; indeed, it is these submissions by buying utilities that petitioners complain (rightly in some degree) were before FERC but not seriously addressed in its orders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At least where forward-looking industry-wide regulation is at issue, it is increasingly common for agencies to employ such hearings by affidavit and nothing more. In such situations, courts have approved of this agency practice when any genuine issues of material fact can be \"adequately resolved on the written record.\" E.g., Town of Norwood, 202 F.3d at 404; La. Energy &amp; Power Auth. v. FERC, 141 F.3d 364, 371 (D.C. Cir. 1998); see also La. Ass'n of Indep. Producers &amp; Royalty Owners v. FERC, 958 F.2d 1101, 1113 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (trial-type evidentiary hearing not necessary to answer \"purely technical issue\" \"whether additional pipeline capacity is needed to meet future demand\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, an agency can do more: it can afford oral hearings in which cross-examination is conducted before an administrative law judge; in utility regulation, direct testimony is commonly offered (as here) in written form. Whether and when particular procedures are necessary is no longer governed by clear-cut judicial rules. It is often said that an agency's decisions as to procedure are reviewed for abuse of discretion,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> and, again, the reasons for deference are especially strong where the decision is entangled with the agency's expert judgment regarding forward-looking industry-wide regulation, see, e.g., Fresno Mobile Radio, Inc. v. FCC, 165 F.3d 965, 971 (D.C. Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the question whether buying utilities had a fair opportunity to respond to the prospect of an $8.75 charge, there are two additional points. First, in 77 pages of comments filed with FERC on August 28, 2000 (the very same day that sellers filed protests arguing for the $8.75 charge), buying utilities specifically anticipated, and responded extensively to, arguments for the $8.75 charge. Thus, under the particular circumstances of this case, FERC's general rule against answers to protests, 18 C.F.R. &#167; 385.213(a)(2) (2000), did not prevent buying utilities from presenting the principal arguments against the $8.75 charge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second, more decisive point is that, whatever the adequacy of the \"hearing\" provided before December 15, opponents to the $8.75 charge had ample opportunity to contest the $8.75 charge in their requests for rehearing. See Boston Edison Co. v. FERC, 885 F.2d 962, 966 (1st Cir. 1989). As noted above, FERC's March 6 order considered the various arguments against the $8.75 charge and responded to them. The main question remains not whether petitioners' arguments were heard, but what FERC should have done to respond to them adequately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, on remand petitioners are free to ask FERC for the opportunity to make further submissions and to show FERC why oral cross-examination is necessary. As we are structuring our remand, petitioners will have no incentive for delay and good reason for expedition; they can then consider again whether they think oral cross-examination is vital. And something may depend on how FERC proposes to answer the objections made to its contemplated $8.75 charge and just how much of an interim measure it intends the $8.75 charge to be.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Remand. We conclude that certain specific issues raised by opponents of the $8.75 charge require more reasoned consideration than FERC afforded. The results of FERC's orders may well be defensible, given FERC's view that immediate action is required and that the charge can be reconsidered if opponents provide an adequate alternative regime. However, the immediate impact of those orders is high and FERC's errors and omissions are troubling. Thus, a remand is appropriate for further explanation. Noram Gas, 148 F.3d at 1165-66.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal questions that FERC needs to answer more fully are these: why, despite petitioners' various claims to the contrary, a substantial ICAP charge is still required to enforce reserve obligations; why, in light of petitioners' claims of a lower present cost of peaking capacity, $8.75 is the proper interim figure; and why any alternatives already proffered by opponents are inadequate or are otherwise not properly considered at this time. Answers can be imagined, but it is FERC that must formulate and adopt them in the first instance. SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 196 (1947).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A reviewing court that perceives flaws in an agency's explanation is not required automatically to set aside the inadequately explained order. Allied-Signal, Inc. v. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Comm'n, 988 F.2d 146, 150-51 (D.C. Cir. 1993). Whether to do so rests in the sound discretion of the reviewing court; and it depends inter alia on the severity of the errors, the likelihood that they can be mended without altering the order, and on the balance of equities and public interest considerations. Int'l Union, United Mine Workers of Am. v. Fed. Mine Safety &amp; Health Admin., 920 F.2d 960, 966-67 (D.C. Cir. 1990). Here, a preliminary assessment suggests that the errors at issue can probably be mended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, FERC's warrant that the charge is needed now to assure adequate energy supplies in New England carries weight. FERC has plausibly adverted to the need for confidence among power suppliers that reserve requirements will be meaningfully enforced. Cf. Fresno Mobile Radio, 165 F.3d at 971. An on again-off again ICAP charge is not likely to encourage suppliers to maintain marginal (i.e., high cost) existing plant or to build new facilities for peak demand. At least at this time, we think that the public interest in assuring power is decisive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In remanding, we leave open to FERC's informed judgment the decision whether to conduct further proceedings (and, if so, what kind) or whether simply to write a further decision on reconsideration. Nor do we preclude FERC from modifying the outcome if it is so advised. No time limit need be imposed at this time. If FERC unduly delays, any party to this case may apply to us for an order fixing a deadline for agency reconsideration. Cf. Int'l Union, 920 F.2d at 967.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We retain jurisdiction over this case to issue all orders necessary to assure compliance with our mandate and to review whatever decision FERC makes on reconsideration in response to our mandate, assuming that the decision remains contested. Cf. BASF Wyandotte Corp. v. Costle, 598 F.2d 637, 663 (1st Cir. 1979); Kennecott Copper Corp. v. EPA, 462 F.2d 846, 851 n.21 (D.C. Cir. 1972). FERC's counsel is directed to file a status report, served on all other parties, with the Clerk of this court every 45 days from the date of this decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, FERC's orders of December 15, 2000, and March 6, 2001, are not vacated at this time but the case is remanded for further action consistent with this decision. Parties may petition for rehearing of this court's decision in the ordinary course. However, our prior stay order barring the $8.75 charge is vacated forthwith, and FERC is free to re-impose its $8.75 charge prospectively, either at once or as of some specified future date. All parties shall bear their own costs in this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> About 130 utilities in New England are members of New England Power Pool (\"NEPOOL\"), a voluntary association formed in 1971 to facilitate the pooling of power and the coordination of construction and maintenance of generating facilities.

This court stayed implementation of all but a small portion of the charge pending judicial review. The background is complicated but can be summarized as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In New England, as in other regions of the country, electrical power is furnished through a grid of interconnected intercity transmission lines and local distribution lines within each city or town. Power is generated within the region, or purchased from outside (e.g., from Canada). Some utilities engage in all three functions (generation, intercity transmission, local distribution); but many are local \"retailers\" who own only the local distribution facilities within a town and purchase all of their needs from generating utilities that have surplus power.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regulation is divided between FERC and state regulatory commissions, but generally speaking, FERC regulates wholesale transactions (e.g., between a power-supplying utility with a surplus and a local municipal utility that retails power). 16 U.S.C. &#167; 824(b)(1) (1994); FPC v. Conway Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109470\"><a href=\"/opinion/109470/fpc-v-conway-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">271</span></a></span>, 276-77 (1976). In the past, power was provided largely on a non-competitive basis with regulated rates based upon costs; but, as in other industries like telecommunications, some power regulators, including FERC, have been moving in recent years toward more reliance upon competition. Town of Norwood v. FERC, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">202</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">392</span></span>, 396 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The demand for electricity varies, depending on weather, economic growth, and other factors; supply is constrained by the time needed to build new generating plants and by unexpected breakdowns in generation or transmission facilities; and electricity cannot economically be stored for future use in large quantities. To avoid the extraordinary disruption of blackouts, regulators and utilities calculate reserve requirements based on estimates of how much generating capacity will be needed at the highest point of the peak load.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our case concerns the mechanism for assuring that utilities will have the reserve power needed to satisfy peak demand. Because the system as a whole must be built to satisfy peak demand, a good deal of generating capacity is destined to lie idle at least some of the time. A prudent utility that retails power to local customers will purchase from a generating utility a certain amount of reserve capacity--in effect, capacity that is reserved for that retailer but may be used only rarely. But it is not certain that under present industry conditions the retailer has adequate economic incentive to purchase all the reserve capacity that it needs. And if reserve capacity is not purchased in sufficient amounts, generating utilities may lack the incentive to build as much capacity as is needed to supply peak demand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The incentive structure in the industry is immensely complicated and economists take different views on how best (i.e., cheaply and reliably) to secure adequate reserves. But, for a number of years prior to 1998, FERC and the New England utilities under its supervision used the so-called ICAP deficiency charge as a device to assure that purchasing utilities would buy adequate reserve capacity to cover projected peak load plus a reserve margin. ISO New Eng., Inc., 91 FERC &#182; 61,311, at 62,080 (2000); see also Municipalities of Groton v.

From 1990 onward, the charge was $8.75 per kilowatt-month; thus, if during a particular period the reserves purchased by an LSE fell below its allocated share of all needed reserves, the LSE paid the specified charge times the amount of its deficiency. Through a complicated arrangement, most of the money went as extra compensation to power-supplying utilities, supplementing the amounts they earned by selling electrical power and committing reserve capacity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The theory underlying the $8.75 figure, which prevailed in New England from 1990 to 1998, was that it approximated the cost (appropriately amortized) to construct a kilowatt-month of new generating capacity available for peak demand conditions, plus an additional \"penalty.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The penalty's theoretical basis is not crystal clear, but the existence and value of the penalty are not issues in this case. The key issue is whether FERC, after allowing the $8.75 charge to be abandoned in New England in 1998 and 1999, could reinstate it in 2000 in the way that it did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1998, New England utilities obtained FERC's approval to abandon the flat ICAP deficiency charge in favor of a so-called auction market for buying additional reserve capacity, that is, required capacity over and above that acquired through bilateral contracts (which are common and often long-term). However, the auction market appears not to have been successful--among other things, the prices were thought to have been subject to manipulation. In March 2000, ISO New England, Inc. (\"ISO-NE\")--the \"independent system operator\" that manages power transactions on behalf of the utilities in the New England Power Pool--sought FERC's consent to an end to the auction regime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 28, 2000, FERC released a lengthy order (\"the June 28 order\") that largely addressed other ISO-NE issues but which toward its end addressed the ICAP issue in a few paragraphs, ISO New Eng., 91 FERC &#182; 61,311, at 62,080-81. In the order, FERC agreed with ISO-NE that the auction did not work, but, because ISO-NE had not proposed an alternative means to ensure that LSE's would purchase adequate reserve capacity, FERC said that although it would permit an end to the auction as of August 1, 2000, it would \"also require the ISO to revert to administratively-determined sanctions for failure [of LSE'S] to meet the existing ICAP requirement,\" i.e., the projected reserve capacity requirement. Id. at 62,081. ISO-NE was directed to file tariffs \"proposing an appropriate ICAP deficiency charge within 30 days.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ISO-NE responded with a filing that proposed a charge of $0.17--a fraction (less than 2 percent) of the charge that had prevailed from 1990 to 1998; this figure was proffered as an average price paid for power during 1999 on the now abandoned auction market. Various utilities who supply surplus power protested bitterly; they not only challenged the proposal as unsupported but said that if adopted this minimal figure would become a de facto cap on prices in the bilateral-contract market in which much of the reserve capacity is purchased, further reducing incentives for generating utilities to construct new plant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 15, 2000, FERC issued a fourteen-paragraph order (\"the December 15 order\") rejecting the proposed $0.17 charge. FERC brushed aside this figure as \"a token payment,\" saying that use of the auction average was not appropriate. ISO New Eng., Inc., 93 FERC &#182; 61,290, at 61,974-75 (2000). FERC then ordered reinstatement of the original $8.75 figure, effective August 1, 2000, until ISO-NE proposed some other adequate regime. FERC said that $8.75 \"represents an approximation of the cost to install a peaking unit and represents a reasonable basis for setting a level to incent the construction of new generation.\" Id. at 61,975.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitions for rehearing followed, and FERC deferred the $8.75 charge pending their disposition. On March 6, 2001, FERC issued a decision on reconsideration (\"the March 6 order\"), rejecting the petitions with one qualification. ISO New Eng., Inc., 94 FERC &#182; 61,237, at 61,846-47 (2001). After elaborating on its reasons for disallowing the $0.17 charge and requiring a return to the $8.75 level, FERC said that it would make the higher charge effective only from April 1, 2001, onward; because of intervening reliance on the $0.17 figure, it would be used for payments from August 1, 2000, through March 31, 2001. Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Various utilities then petitioned for review in this court, and other utilities intervened on both sides. 16 U.S.C. &#167; 825l(b). This court then granted petitioners' motion to stay the $8.75 charge pendente lite and expedited briefing. As the stay order permitted, FERC then ordered the $0.17 charge to continue in effect pending this court's review. Briefing and oral argument in this court followed. In this court, petitioners and others who support them principally attack the adoption of the $8.75 charge and, secondarily, the rejection of ISO-NE's proposed $0.17 charge. The standard of review varies, of course, with the particular claim of error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On review, petitioners' main assault is on FERC's imposition of the $8.75 charge. They do not contest FERC's statutory power to adopt an ICAP charge pursuant to its authority to set just and reasonable rates for wholesale power, 16 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 824(b)(1), 824e(a) (1994); but they say that the $8.75 charge is not supported by substantial evidence. We begin with this claim and consider, in later sections, related claims that FERC failed to consider reasonable alternatives and that the orders are procedurally flawed (above all, by the lack of an evidentiary hearing).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Basis for the $8.75 Charge. Although petitioners' caption refers to a lack of substantial evidence for adopting the $8.75 charge, their attack is actually a multi-faceted challenge to FERC's reasoning, substantive judgments, alleged misstatements and asserted failures to discuss issues or evidence. There is, indeed, a good deal to criticize in FERC's orders, and we conclude that further proceedings are necessary. However, the criticisms can be understood and assessed only against the background of FERC's basic rationale for adopting the $8.75 charge, and it is useful to set forth at the outset our understanding of what FERC did and why it did it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As already noted, FERC long ago approved an ICAP charge for the New England area to cope with what it conceives to be a need to assure adequate plant construction and margin of reserves. Such ICAP charges are used in the New York region and in the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland area; how the matter is handled away from the east coast is less clear. See note 5 below. FERC has been moving federal energy regulation toward more competition, but the transition is far from complete, and no one knows for certain whether special incentives will be needed indefinitely or what kind would work best.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this background, FERC has insisted that reserve requirements be maintained but, in 1998 and 1999, it allowed ISO-NE to substitute a short-term auction market as an enforcement device. That scheme, it appears, did not work and petitioners do not contend otherwise. So FERC simply restored the pre-existing $8.75 ICAP charge for the time being while making clear that it was open to other proposals from ISO-NE or others for a better way to assure adequate reserves. In the abstract, there is nothing in this rationale that is startling, let alone irrational; but the devil, as usual, is in the details.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, petitioners attack FERC's statement that $8.75 \"represents an approximation of the cost to install a peaking [generating] unit.\" In fact, say petitioners, FERC has not cited \"even one iota of evidence in support of this fact-intensive assertion\" and the highest figure that \"even the proponents of the $8.75 charge could muster [in affidavits] . . . was $5.\" Petitioners may be correct on the numbers, but the problem is with FERC's verbal sloppiness rather than any more fundamental defect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As petitioners know perfectly well, the $8.75 figure was, even when adopted years ago, an overstatement of the cost of a peaking unit; the record before FERC in these proceedings established that in 1990 the peaking unit cost was estimated at about $5 and the balance, and certainly the balance above $6, see note 2 above, therefore represented a further \"penalty\" charge with a different rationale, see New Eng. Power Pool Agreement, 56 FPC 1562, 1599-1600 (1976), petition for rev. denied sub nom. Municipalities of Groton v. FERC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"361172\"><a href=\"/opinion/361172/municipalities-of-groton-v-federal-energy-regulatory-commission-nepool/\"><span class=\"volume\">587</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1296</span></a></span> (D.C. Cir. 1978).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Petitioners do not even explicitly address, let alone challenge, the rationale for the additional \"penalty\" charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, it is apparent that when FERC called the $8.75 charge \"the cost\" of a peaking unit, it was adopting the original rationale as well as the original figure, but carelessly simplifying the rationale. This is a venial sin except so far as it symbolizes FERC's broader failure to address carefully and fully objections to a rate change--the forced re-adoption of the original $8.75 charge--that might increase local electrical rates in New England by many millions of dollars annually.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, the actual impact of the $8.75 charge on retail electric rates in New England is not certain--despite dire predictions from retailing utilities. The ICAP charge is paid only if an LSE fails to buy adequate reserve capacity in advance; the charge, including the penalty, is the spur to do so. So if LSE'S comply with their obligations through bilateral contracts, there remains a question as to how much the background ICAP charge will drive up retail prices in New England. In any event, FERC's description of $8.75 as an approximation of generation costs is not a serious problem, unless actual peaking costs are shown to have fallen (an issue to which we return below).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioners' second claim of error is more basic. Petitioners point to FERC's central determination that $8.75 represents \"a reasonable basis for setting a level to incent [i.e., create the incentive for] the construction of new generation.\" They then say that ISO-NE showed that there was enough planned construction in New England to provide adequate reserves without the charge; that FERC did not respond to affidavit showings by opponents that the charge was unnecessary; that there is nothing to show that a charge above $0.17 is needed; and that merely to point to the prior $8.75 charge is insufficient given the lapse in time and changes in the industry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These contentions have more force than FERC admits but less than petitioners pretend. As to whether any charge is needed, FERC says on appeal that this issue is not properly presented because it was decided by FERC in its June 28 order and judicial review from that order has not been sought. But the reason review has not been sought is that petitions for rehearing were filed at FERC and FERC has still not acted upon them. We doubt that an agency can use a prior order as a premise for a drastic second step--a possibly multimillion dollar rate increase--but insulate the premise from review by failing to act on rehearing petitions. Cf. Competitive Telecomms. Ass'n v. FCC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"720632\"><a href=\"/opinion/720632/competitive-telecommunications-association-v-federal-communications/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">522</span></a></span>, 531 (D.C. Cir. 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the question whether any charge is needed overlaps with the further questions whether a substantial charge is needed and whether $8.75, $0.17 or some other figure should be used. This last question, at least, was not decided in the June 28 order; indeed, it arose in response to that order. Nor did FERC make in the June 28 order any detailed findings of a kind that might control at the second stage, the setting of an interim charge. In short, FERC's \"jurisdictional\" objection to our consideration of the claimed error is hollow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, petitioners' own claims on the merits are overstated. That ISO-NE says reserves are adequate without a charge proves little: it appears that most of the utilities served by ISO-NE are net buyers and have a self-interested incentive to object to a charge. And even if present \"plans\" promise ample new construction, FERC's orders (bolstered by affidavits presented below) apparently reflect the reasonable view that plans are only that and can easily be affected by the prospect that reserve requirements for buyers will or will not have teeth. If a buying utility can purchase below its reserve requirement without penalty, it may find it worthwhile to do so most of the time--while counting on the system to bail it out in a crisis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The more difficult question concerns FERC's failure to discuss in any detail the extensive affidavit filings by objectors who claim that--given the current state of the industry and conditions in New England--no substantial charge or at least none greater than $0.17 is needed. Some of these filings are by recognized experts and are substantial and detailed; and although there are counter-affidavits from utilities who are presumably net sellers, this is the kind of material that one would normally expect an agency to analyze seriously in its decision before making drastic changes, especially where millions of dollars may ride on the outcome. E.g., Noram Gas Transmission Co. v. FERC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184586\"><a href=\"/opinion/184586/noram-gas-transm-v-ferc/\"><span class=\"volume\">148</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1158</span></a></span>, 1162-65 (D.C. Cir. 1998); K N Energy, Inc. v. FERC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"586801\"><a href=\"/opinion/586801/k-n-energy-inc-v-federal-energy-regulatory-commission-western-gas/\"><span class=\"volume\">968</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1295</span></a></span>, 1302-04 (D.C. Cir. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet this case is not the typical one in which something drastic is being done for the first time. The reserve requirements have long existed in New England and are not directly challenged by petitioners. And enforcement through a substantial ICAP charge (indeed, from 1990 on with the precise $8.75 figure) had been standard practice in New England for over a decade before the temporary use of an auction in 1998 and 1999 which was either a failure (as FERC found) or at least not successful enough for petitioners to defend in this court. So FERC's best answer is that the real status quo ante is the $8.75 figure and that the burden was really upon petitioners to justify a departure (i.e., no charge or something less than $8.75).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No one has cited any case law closely in point, but common sense suggests the answer. FERC did not in the first instance have to provide additional justification either for the need for a substantial charge or for the $8.75 figure; but given the detailed arguments in opposition and the possible dollar impact of reinstatement of the $8.75 charge, it owed petitioners (and the public who will likely pay some of any ICAP charge through passed-on retail rate increases) some explanation as to why FERC was not persuaded by petitioners' efforts to discredit the notion of a substantial charge in general or the $8.75 charge in particular.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Undoubtedly FERC was annoyed, perhaps rightly, when its direction to ISO-NE to reinstitute an administrative charge was met by a proposal that FERC regarded as risible: a figure that was a tiny fraction of the prior charge and of the ICAP charges prevailing elsewhere on the Atlantic coast.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> And given the impact of any widespread power shortage, FERC has every reason to want effective enforcement of reserve requirements, even if enforcement comes at a high price. Still, FERC is not therefore excused from explaining its actions. Addressing contrary arguments is part of establishing public acceptability and, in any event, is part of FERC's own responsibility. See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110991\"><a href=\"/opinion/110991/motor-vehicle-mfrs-assn-of-united-states-inc-v-state-farm-mut/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 42-44, 48-50 (1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What we have said applies as much to the specific choice of the $8.75 figure as to the need for a substantial charge. Absent evidence of significant change in construction costs, FERC was entitled to revert to the pre-existing figure rather than justify it afresh in the first instance, cf. S. La. Area Rate Cases v. FPC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"290900\"><a href=\"/opinion/290900/southern-louisiana-area-rate-cases-austral-oil-co-v-federal-power/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">407</span></a></span>, 433 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">400</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">950</span></span> (1970); but it was not entitled to ignore claims that the cost of peaking facilities is less than it was in the past. Such claims have been made in this case; perhaps they can be easily answered; or, if lengthy proceedings would be needed to do so, FERC may be able to justify restoring the $8.75 charge on a provisional basis while making the evaluation. But some response from FERC is required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An agency's expert judgments are entitled to deference, especially where safety concerns are on one side of the balance, as they are here.

Cir. 1989); cf. K N Energy, 968 F.2d at 1303. If FERC had provided even a semblance of serious discussion as to why a substantial ICAP charge was still required and why the pre-existing figure was the best solution on short notice, quite probably the charge would be sustained outright. California's recent experience is likely irrelevant as to immediate causes but not as to consequences. But this is all the more reason for FERC to write a decision reflecting a serious look at objections.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatives. In addition to attacking the $8.75 charge as unsupported, petitioners make a series of further arguments, beginning with the claim that FERC \"failed to consider reasonable alternatives [to the $8.75 charge], which it was obligated to do under reasoned decision-making principles.\" Petitioners say that \"FERC's only response was that it was inappropriate to consider these alternatives when proposed in a rehearing request,\" and they contend that this response is inadequate because rehearing was \"the first time\" in which parties opposed to the $8.75 charge could propose alternatives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioners have markedly overstated any legitimate grievance. Broadly speaking, agencies are expected to consider reasonable alternatives to proposed actions, Farmers Union Cent. Exch., Inc. v.

It said that the record did not provide a basis to sustain the main alternative urged (i.e., using bilateral contract prices to construct an ICAP charge) and that ISO-NE was welcome to formulate alternatives and support them in a new filing. ISO New Eng., 94 FERC &#182; 61,237, at 61,847.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the sense that agencies should address alternatives before acting is not hard and fast: if prompt action is necessary and delay would be harmful, agencies sometimes do need to take interim action, deferring to further proceedings other facets of the problem or alternative solutions that may take more time to develop. See Competitive Telecomms. Ass'n, 87 F.3d at 531; Nat'l Air Carrier Ass'n v.

And, for multiple reasons in this case, there is nothing unreasonable in FERC's demand that proponents furnish the proposed alternatives with adequate support.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is quite true that FERC should have said more to explain why it concluded that \"the record in this proceeding does not contain adequate information to support a just and reasonable ICAP deficiency charge based on prices in the bilateral market.\" ISO New Eng., 94 FERC &#182; 61,237, at 61,847. This is so even if we assume, with FERC, that petitioners could have pointed to such alternatives before the December 15 order, knowing that protests to the earlier compliance filing had urged that the $8.75 charge be re-adopted. But FERC did address the main alternative and found it wanting even if FERC's explanation was too cryptic; the alternative was not rejected simply because it was belatedly offered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, on remand FERC should explain why, on this record, the bilateral-market prices are not an adequately supported substitute. If other substantial alternatives were presented, FERC should also address them. But we harbor some doubts about the strength of petitioners' claim as to other alternatives; it is hard in their briefs to find any substantial discussion of what the alternatives were and why (absent the $8.75 charge) they might be expected effectively to enforce the reserve obligations that already exist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The $0.17 Charge. This brings us to petitioners' next objection, which is superficially quite different because it focuses on the rejection of the $0.17 charge rather than the adoption of the $8.75 charge. Although petitioners do not contest FERC's general authority to review the $0.17 charge, 16 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 824d, 824e (1994), they say that under established case law, FERC had no power to \"reject\" ISO-NE's $0.17 proposal without a \"hearing\" because it was not procedurally deficient or substantively a \"nullity,\" Mun.

But the $0.17 charge was not just a typical utility-initiated rate charge but was purportedly filed in compliance with FERC's June 28 order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, FERC says that the $0.17 rate was inconsistent with its June 28 order and that that order cannot be attacked in this proceeding. The two propositions are quite different. We have already explained why the premises of the June 28 order cannot be insulated from criticism insofar as those premises are used to support FERC's later actions. However, the fact that the June 28 order is still before FERC on rehearing petitions does not prevent FERC from relying upon it in evaluating a purported compliance filing, which is just what the $0.17 proposal constituted. The June 28 order was effective unless stayed, and no stay was secured either from FERC or from a reviewing court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to FERC's December 15 order rejecting the proposal, the $0.17 charge was a nominal rather than a plausible response to the June 28 directive. If FERC was correct, it was entitled to reject the filing as patently inconsistent with an existing, unstayed directive. \"[A] utility is not entitled to a hearing before the non-conforming portion of its rate filing is rejected or when it challenges an established policy,\" Jersey Cent.

FERC certainly did make a determination of non-compliance, and in this determination it enjoys a favorable standard of review, Pepperell Assocs. v. U.S. EPA, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772788\"><a href=\"/opinion/772788/pepperell-associates-v-united-states-environmental-protection-agency/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir. 2001).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Whether FERC adequately explained the determination is a different question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In critiquing the determination, petitioners focus on a terse and arguably confusing statement by FERC that the $0.17 was merely an average derived from the (now abandoned) auction market and was not \"useful.\" Yet, fairly read, FERC's June 28 order clearly envisaged a return to a substantial ICAP charge; and the core concept of such a charge has long been in New England, and still is in other Atlantic Coast regions, the cost of adding new peak load generating capacity (not excluding a possible penalty as well). That cost is far above $0.17 and probably lies in the $5.00 range. On this premise, the $0.17 proposal was plainly non-complying, and FERC's rejection of the $0.17 proposal was therefore well justified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Procedural Matters. Petitioners' final argument on review brings them back to FERC's adoption of the $8.75 charge. In adopting this charge, say petitioners, FERC \"failed to provide due process and unreasonably refused to hold a hearing.\" Two quite different arguments are presented under this heading: first, that FERC was required to hold not just a hearing (which it did) but a specific kind of hearing before adopting the $8.75 charge; and second, that because selling utilities first proposed the $8.75 charge in protesting the $0.17 filing, the buying utilities had no fair opportunity to respond since \"[u]nder FERC's rules, answers to protests are not permitted.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term \"hearing\" is notoriously malleable, but what petitioners got here was not only a hearing but a species of evidentiary hearing<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> which is now quite common in utility and carrier regulation, e.g., Town of Norwood, 202 F.3d at 404. Very extensive evidentiary submissions were made by both sides in the form of affidavits from experts and others, together with extensive written argument; indeed, it is these submissions by buying utilities that petitioners complain (rightly in some degree) were before FERC but not seriously addressed in its orders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At least where forward-looking industry-wide regulation is at issue, it is increasingly common for agencies to employ such hearings by affidavit and nothing more. In such situations, courts have approved of this agency practice when any genuine issues of material fact can be \"adequately resolved on the written record.\" E.g., Town of Norwood, 202 F.3d at 404; La. Energy &amp; Power Auth. v. FERC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184486\"><a href=\"/opinion/184486/la-engy-power-auth-v-ferc/\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span>, 371 (D.C.

Cir. 1992) (trial-type evidentiary hearing not necessary to answer \"purely technical issue\" \"whether additional pipeline capacity is needed to meet future demand\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, an agency can do more: it can afford oral hearings in which cross-examination is conducted before an administrative law judge; in utility regulation, direct testimony is commonly offered (as here) in written form. Whether and when particular procedures are necessary is no longer governed by clear-cut judicial rules. It is often said that an agency's decisions as to procedure are reviewed for abuse of discretion,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> and, again, the reasons for deference are especially strong where the decision is entangled with the agency's expert judgment regarding forward-looking industry-wide regulation, see, e.g., Fresno Mobile Radio, Inc. v. FCC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184784\"><a href=\"/opinion/184784/fresno-mobile-radio-v-fcc/\"><span class=\"volume\">165</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">965</span></a></span>, 971 (D.C. Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the question whether buying utilities had a fair opportunity to respond to the prospect of an $8.75 charge, there are two additional points. First, in 77 pages of comments filed with FERC on August 28, 2000 (the very same day that sellers filed protests arguing for the $8.75 charge), buying utilities specifically anticipated, and responded extensively to, arguments for the $8.75 charge. Thus, under the particular circumstances of this case, FERC's general rule against answers to protests, 18 C.F.R. &#167; 385.213(a)(2) (2000), did not prevent buying utilities from presenting the principal arguments against the $8.75 charge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second, more decisive point is that, whatever the adequacy of the \"hearing\" provided before December 15, opponents to the $8.75 charge had ample opportunity to contest the $8.75 charge in their requests for rehearing. See Boston Edison Co. v. FERC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529713\"><a href=\"/opinion/529713/boston-edison-company-v-federal-energy-regulatory-commission-towns-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">885</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">962</span></a></span>, 966 (1st Cir. 1989). As noted above, FERC's March 6 order considered the various arguments against the $8.75 charge and responded to them. The main question remains not whether petitioners' arguments were heard, but what FERC should have done to respond to them adequately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, on remand petitioners are free to ask FERC for the opportunity to make further submissions and to show FERC why oral cross-examination is necessary. As we are structuring our remand, petitioners will have no incentive for delay and good reason for expedition; they can then consider again whether they think oral cross-examination is vital. And something may depend on how FERC proposes to answer the objections made to its contemplated $8.75 charge and just how much of an interim measure it intends the $8.75 charge to be.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Remand. We conclude that certain specific issues raised by opponents of the $8.75 charge require more reasoned consideration than FERC afforded. The results of FERC's orders may well be defensible, given FERC's view that immediate action is required and that the charge can be reconsidered if opponents provide an adequate alternative regime. However, the immediate impact of those orders is high and FERC's errors and omissions are troubling. Thus, a remand is appropriate for further explanation. Noram Gas, 148 F.3d at 1165-66.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principal questions that FERC needs to answer more fully are these: why, despite petitioners' various claims to the contrary, a substantial ICAP charge is still required to enforce reserve obligations; why, in light of petitioners' claims of a lower present cost of peaking capacity, $8.75 is the proper interim figure; and why any alternatives already proffered by opponents are inadequate or are otherwise not properly considered at this time. Answers can be imagined, but it is FERC that must formulate and adopt them in the first instance. SEC v. Chenery Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104462\"><a href=\"/opinion/104462/sec-v-chenery-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">332</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span>, 196 (1947).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A reviewing court that perceives flaws in an agency's explanation is not required automatically to set aside the inadequately explained order.

Whether to do so rests in the sound discretion of the reviewing court; and it depends inter alia on the severity of the errors, the likelihood that they can be mended without altering the order, and on the balance of equities and public interest considerations.

FERC has plausibly adverted to the need for confidence among power suppliers that reserve requirements will be meaningfully enforced. Cf. Fresno Mobile Radio, 165 F.3d at 971. An on again-off again ICAP charge is not likely to encourage suppliers to maintain marginal (i.e., high cost) existing plant or to build new facilities for peak demand. At least at this time, we think that the public interest in assuring power is decisive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In remanding, we leave open to FERC's informed judgment the decision whether to conduct further proceedings (and, if so, what kind) or whether simply to write a further decision on reconsideration. Nor do we preclude FERC from modifying the outcome if it is so advised. No time limit need be imposed at this time.
