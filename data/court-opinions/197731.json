Fern ndez-Ventura and\r\n\nCede o were indicted for failing to declare currency in excess of\r\n\n$10,000 brought into  the United States, 31  U.S.C.     5316  and\r\n\n5322 (1994), and  for making false statements in  a matter within\r\n\nthe  jurisdiction of the United States Customs Service, 18 U.S.C.\r\n\n    1001 (1994).   Their motions to  suppress statements they had\r\n\nmade to the Customs officers at San Juan's international  airport\r\n\nwere  granted on  the  ground  that they  had  been subjected  to\r\n\ncustodial interrogation without the benefit of Miranda1 warnings.\r                                                                \r\n\nWe reversed the district court, United States v.

The district court  reexamined\r\n\nthe  record in  light of  our  opinion and  again suppressed  the\r\n\nevidence for failure  to comply with Miranda.

The\r\n\nCustoms Service  had Fern ndez-Ventura's name  on a  computerized\r\n\n\"lookout\" list,  due  to  his frequent  travel  between  the  two\r\n\ncities.  After  Fern ndez-Ventura  cleared  immigration,  Customs\r\n\ninspector  Rose  Espada   sent  him  to  the   secondary  Customs\r\n\ninspection  area,  where  Customs  officers  Eugene  Fischer  and\r\n\nRichard  Rausch interviewed him  and searched his  bags.  Officer\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\r                               \r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nFischer asked Fern ndez-Ventura whether he was bringing more than\r\n\n$10,000  cash into the United States, and Fern ndez-Ventura said,\r\n\n\"No.\"  He said he had about $8,000.\r\n\n          Meanwhile,  Officer Rausch  found  women's clothing  in\r\n\nFern ndez-Ventura's bag and asked him  why he had it.  Fern ndez-\r\n\nVentura replied that the clothing belonged to his \"mujer\" (\"wife\"\r\n\nor \"woman\"),  who was traveling  with him.  The  inspectors asked\r\n\nFern ndez-Ventura where she was, and he took Fischer to find her.\r\n\nMilagros  Cede o,  Fern ndez-Ventura's  girlfriend,  had  already\r\n\ncleared  the  check point  and  was  waiting inside  the  Customs\r\n\nenclosure.    Fern ndez-Ventura  beckoned  to   Cede o,  and  she\r\n\nreturned with  Fischer  and Fern ndez-Ventura  to the  inspection\r\n\narea.  As they walked, Fischer asked Cede o if she had  more than\r\n\n$10,000  in cash,  and she  replied  that she  had about  $9,000.\r\n\nRausch searched Cede o's purse and found $9,500.\r\n\n          Rausch then  contacted a supervisor, H ctor  Alvino, to\r\n\nask for  permission to  search Fern ndez-Ventura.   Rausch  found\r\n\n$6,666 in cash on Fern ndez-Ventura.  Alvino then became involved\r\n\nin the questioning.  Alvino asked Fern ndez-Ventura who owned the\r\n\n$6,666,  and Fern ndez-Ventura replied that the money belonged to\r\n\nhis  money exchange  company.   Alvino then  asked who  owned the\r\n\n$9,500 in  Cede o's possession,  and Fern ndez-Ventura said  that\r\n\nmoney also  belonged to the company.  Fern ndez-Ventura said that\r\n\nhe was president of the company.2  Alvino then sent for a special\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  Though Fern dez-Ventura and Cede o each had less than $10,000,\r\nthe government contends that all  the money belonged to one owner\r\nand is therefore aggregated.  United States v. Fern ndez-Ventura,\r                                                                          \r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nagent to  arrest Fern ndez-Ventura.   The  agent told  Fischer to\r\n\nread  Fern ndez-Ventura and  Cede o their  rights.   They  signed\r\n\nMiranda waiver cards.\r                 \r\n\n          The district court  initially suppressed the statements\r\n\nmade after  Fischer asked Cede o  if she was carrying  any money.\r\n\nUnited States v.  Ventura, 892 F. Supp. 362,  369 (D. Puerto Rico\r                                   \r\n\n1995).  The district court held that, since Fern ndez-Ventura and\r\n\nCede o were not free to  leave the interview, they were therefore\r\n\nin  custody and  entitled to Miranda  warnings. The  court wrote,\r                                              \r\n\n\"Customs is  an inherently  coercive environment.\"   Id.  at 367.\r                                                                  \r\n\nThe district court also relied on the officers' state of mind and\r\n\ntheir belief that they had a \"promising theory of guilt.\"  Id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n369.\r\n\n          We reversed, holding  that the district court  erred in\r\n\nconcluding  that  Fern ndez-Ventura  and Cede o  were  in custody\r\n\nbecause they could not leave.  We held:\r\n\n            Individuals  subject  to  routine traffic\r\n            stops     or     customs     inspections,\r\n            circumstances  which  are  not custodial,\r\n            are rarely  free  to  leave  while  being\r\n            questioned by  an officer.   The relevant\r\n            inquiry, however, . .  . is whether there\r\n            was an arrest or restraint on freedom  of\r\n            movement of the  degree associated with a\r\n            formal arrest.\r\n\nVentura I, 85 F.3d at 712.   We further stated that the  district\r                   \r\n\ncourt  erred  in considering  the  officers' focus  on Fern ndez-\r\n\nVentura and Cede o, which was not relevant to a Miranda inquiry.\r                                                                 \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n892 F. Supp. 362, 370 (D. Puerto Rico 1995).\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n          On remand,  the district  court reexamined the  custody\r\n\nissue,   looking  at  three  factors:  (1)   the  nature  of  the\r\n\nsurroundings   and  the  extent   of  police  control   over  the\r\n\nsurroundings; (2) the degree of physical restraint  placed on the\r\n\nsuspect; and (3) the  duration and character of the  questioning.\r\n\nUnited  States v. Ventura,  947 F. Supp.  25, 29 (D.  Puerto Rico\r                                   \r\n\n1996).    The district  court  held  that  the surroundings  were\r\n\nindicative of custody because the officers sent Fern ndez-Ventura\r\n\nstraight  to secondary  inspection  without  first going  through\r\n\nprimary  inspection,  and  because  there  were  \"four  uniformed\r\n\nofficers  with the  defendants at  all  times, two  of whom  were\r\n\narmed.\"  Id. at 30.   The court conceded that  neither Fern ndez-\r                      \r\n\nVentura nor Cede o was physically  restrained, but held that  the\r\n\nsecond  factor nevertheless weighed  in favor of  custody because\r\n\n\"they were  unaware of  any ability  to leave  and  were in  fact\r\n\nunable to leave.\"   Id.  Moreover,  the court considered it  very\r                                 \r\n\nimportant  that Cede o  had  already  cleared  Customs  when  the\r\n\nofficers asked her to  return.  Id.  Finally, the  court held the\r                                             \r\n\nduration  of the questioning,  approximately one hour  and twenty\r\n\nminutes,  was  indicative of  custody.    Id.   The  court  again\r                                                       \r\n\nsuppressed  the statements made after  Cede o was returned to the\r\n\ninspection area.  Id. at 31.\r                               \r\n\n          The district  court's conclusion  that a  person is  in\r\n\ncustody is a mixed  question of fact and law, subject  to de novo\r\n\nreview.  Thompson  v. Keohane, 116 S.  Ct. 457, 460 (1995).   The\r                                       \r\n\ndistrict  court's  findings  of  historical  fact concerning  the\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\ncircumstances  of the interrogation are reviewed for clear error.\r\n\nSee Ornelas v.  United States, 116 S. Ct. 1657, 1663 (1996).  The\r                                       \r\n\nultimate question  is  whether  there was  \"a  formal  arrest  or\r\n\nrestraint on freedom of movement  of the degree associated with a\r\n\nformal arrest.\"  Thompson, 116  S. Ct. at 465 (internal quotation\r                                   \r\n\nomitted).  The  test is not applied mechanically,  but in view of\r\n\nthe totality of the circumstances.  See id. at 466.   We conclude\r                                                     \r\n\nthat the district court once again applied this test erroneously.\r\n\n          The most significant circumstance is that this incident\r\n\noccurred in  the course of  a Customs inspection at  our nation's\r\n\nborder.  In the context of Customs inspections, our assessment of\r\n\nwhether an interrogation  is custodial must take into account the\r\n\nstrong governmental  interest in  controlling our  borders.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited  States v.  Moya, 74  F.3d  1117, 1119  (11th Cir.  1996).\r                                 \r\n\n\"[Q]uestions from [Customs]  officials are especially  understood\r\n\nto be a necessary and important routine for travelers arriving at\r\n\nAmerican  entry  points.   This  understanding  cuts  against the\r\n\npotentially coercive aspect  of the Customs inquiry,  and lessens\r\n\nthe need  for  Miranda warnings.\"    Ventura I,  85 F.3d  at  711\r                                                        \r\n\n(citations  omitted).  The Eleventh Circuit has stated, \"[E]vents\r\n\nwhich might  be enough to  signal 'custody' away from  the border\r\n\nwill not be enough to establish 'custody' in the context of entry\r\n\ninto he country.\"  Moya, 74 F.3d at 1120.\r                                 \r\n\n          In its  conclusion that the surroundings  suggested the\r\n\ndefendants  were  in  custody, the  district  court  placed great\r\n\nreliance on the fact that the officers skipped primary inspection\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nand  took Fern ndez-Ventura directly to secondary inspection.  We\r\n\nsaid in Ventura I that \"even secondary inspection does not per se\r                                                                           \r\n\nconstitute custodial  interrogation.\"   83 F.3d  at 711.   Accord\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited States v. Pratt, 645 F.2d 89, 90 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,\r                                                                          \r\n\n454 U.S. 881  (1981); Moya,  74 F.3d  at 1120.   Since  secondary\r                                    \r\n\ninspection is  not innately custodial,  we fail to see  how going\r\n\ndirectly to  secondary  inspection  makes  the  questioning  more\r\n\ncoercive.  As  a practical matter, this likely  reduces the total\r\n\ntime  the traveler  has  to  spend in  Customs,  which makes  the\r\n\nquestioning less coercive, not more.\r\n\n          The  district court's opinion on remand stated that the\r\n\nsurroundings were  coercive  because \"there  were four  uniformed\r\n\nofficers with the defendants at all times.\"  947 F. Supp.  at 30.\r\n\nThe government pointed out that the officers were not all present\r\n\nsimultaneously.   Espada delivered  Fern ndez-Ventura to  Fischer\r\n\nand Rausch, and  then left.  Fischer went  with Fern ndez-Ventura\r\n\nto  get Cede o, and  as the three  of them walked,  Fischer asked\r\n\nCede o  what cash  she was  carrying.   After  Fischer found  the\r\n\n$9,500 on  Cede o, Alvino  appeared on the  scene.   The district\r\n\ncourt   changed  its  opinion  on  reconsideration  to  say  that\r\n\nFern ndez-Ventura and  Cede o  were  \"guarded  by  four  officers\r\n\nduring the course of this incident,\" 947 F. Supp. at 32 (emphasis\r                                            \r\n\nadded), but  the court did  not change its conclusion  that there\r\n\nwere too many officers.  We  conclude that the early  involvement\r\n\nof Espada was inconsequential.   The presence of the three others\r\n\nis  not so  unusual as  to convert  a Customs inspection  into an\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\narrest.   See United  States v.

The court conceded on reconsideration that\r\n\n\"guns were not drawn\" during the  incident.  947 F. Supp. at  32.\r\n\nThe  testimony at  the hearing  was that  Espada and  Alvino were\r\n\nrequired to  be armed  as part of  their jobs.   The  presence of\r\n\narmed officers  in this case  was simply  a part  of the  Customs\r\n\nroutine and not an extraordinary circumstance.\r\n\n          Though  the  district  court conceded  that  Fern ndez-\r\n\nVentura and Cede o were  not subjected to physical restraint,  it\r\n\nresolved the physical restraint factor against the government for\r\n\nthree reasons: (1) the two were \"in fact unable to leave,\" id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n30; (2)   Fern ndez-Ventura was  subjected to a  pat-down search,\r\n\nid.; and  (3) Fischer  requested  that Cede o  return to  Customs\r             \r\n\nafter  she had already  passed through, id.   None of these facts\r                                                     \r\n\nbears  the weight the district  court placed on  them.  First, in\r\n\nVentura  I we specifically instructed  the district court that it\r                    \r\n\ncould not infer that travelers  were in custody because they were\r\n\nnot free simply to walk away from Customs inspectors.  85 F.3d at\r\n\n712.   Yet, the  district court exhibited  the same  reasoning on\r\n\nremand despite our explicit disapproval.  Next, a pat-down search\r\n\nin  a  Customs inspection  was  insufficient  to tip  the  scales\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nagainst  the government  in Pratt, 645  F.2d at 91,  and there is\r                                           \r\n\nnothing unusual about the search in  this case to give it greater\r\n\nimportance  here.   Even  though  Cede o had  passed  through the\r\n\ninspection station,  she had  not left  the international  border\r\n\narea, with  its attendant obligations to cooperate in the Customs\r\n\nprocess.     Moreover,  her  traveling  companion  was  still  in\r\n\ninspection  and she was  apparently waiting for  him.  Therefore,\r\n\nher progress past the inspection area did not remove her from the\r\n\nCustoms context.  Cf. United States v. Wardlaw, 576 F.2d 932, 935\r                                                        \r\n\n(1st  Cir.   1978)(applying  relaxed   standard  for   search  at\r\n\ninternational border where  defendant not  only cleared  Customs,\r\n\nbut also  left the airport  building before being called  back to\r\n\nCustoms).\r\n\n          Finally,   the   district   court   found   that    the\r\n\ninterrogation lasted one hour  and twenty minutes.   The district\r\n\ncourt held, \"This time span ... far exceeds the length of  time a\r\n\nreasonable  person would endure without feeling restrained.\"  947\r\n\nF. Supp. at 34.\r\n\n          Even  the   finding   of  historical   fact  that   the\r\n\nquestioning took an hour and  twenty minutes is problematic.  The\r\n\ndistrict  court found  that the  interrogation began  at  8:10 or\r\n\n8:15, based on Rausch's testimony  about the time of the pat-down\r\n\nof Fern ndez-Ventura.  The court found the interrogation ended at\r\n\n9:40 or  9:45, based on  the times  stated in the  Miranda waiver\r                                                                    \r\n\nforms.   Id.   However, these do  not appear  to be  the relevant\r                      \r\n\ntimes, since  the pat-down  search occurred near  the end  of the\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nquestioning.  On  the Miranda forms Fern ndez-Ventura  and Cede o\r                                       \r\n\nindicated that  they were  not detained until  9:10.   The record\r\n\ncertainly does not indicate that there was protracted questioning\r\n\nafter the pat-down search.  Rather, the witnesses recounted a few\r\n\nstraightforward questions, followed by a call for a special agent\r\n\nto  come and  arrest Fern ndez-Ventura  and  Cede o.   Therefore,\r\n\nalthough the record may support  the conclusion that one hour and\r\n\ntwenty minutes (or more) elapsed during the defendants' encounter\r\n\nwith Customs, it does not support the district court's  inference\r\n\nthat  they were therefore  subjected to \"focused  questioning for\r\n\nnearly an hour and a half.\"  947 F. Supp. at 30.\r\n\n          Additionally, the district court held that  the custody\r\n\nbegan when  Fischer began to  question Cede o.   Id. at  31. This\r                                                              \r\n\noccurred before  the pat-down  search, which  the district  court\r\n\nused as the beginning  of the one-hour-twenty-minute period.   We\r\n\nreject the circular reasoning using the lapse of time as a factor\r\n\nin determining that the two were in custody at a point before the\r\n\none-hour-twenty-minute time period even began.\r\n\n          Moreover, even if the questioning did take one hour and\r\n\ntwenty   minutes,  we  have  already  concluded  that  the  other\r\n\ncircumstances  of the questioning were  routine.  The duration of\r\n\nthe  encounter is \"never  a singly determinative  factor,\" Pratt,\r                                                                          \r\n\n645  F.2d   at  91,  and  the  duration  in  this  case  was  not\r\n\nextraordinary.  We  are not prepared  to say Customs  inspections\r\n\ncannot take this long without becoming an arrest, or even  that a\r\n\ndelay of this length is strongly indicative of arrest.  See Park,\r                                                                          \r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\n947 F.2d at  133, 138 (no arrest where  Customs inspection lasted\r\n\nthree to four hours).\r\n\n          We  conclude that  the factors  cited  by the  district\r\n\ncourt  do not    distinguish  this case  from  a routine  Customs\r\n\ninspection  so  as   to  support  the  court's   conclusion  that\r\n\nFern ndez-Ventura  and  Cede o were  in custody.

Fernandez-Ventura and Cedeno were indicted for failing to declare currency in excess of $10,000 brought into the United States, 31 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 5316 and 5322 (1994), and for making false statements in a matter within the jurisdiction of the United States Customs Service, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1001 (1994).  Their motions to suppress statements they had made to the Customs officers at San Juan's international airport were granted on the ground that they had been subjected to custodial interrogation without the benefit of Miranda<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> warnings.  We reversed the district court, United States v. Ventura, 85 F.3d 708 (1st Cir.1996) (Ventura I ), and remanded for reconsideration under the proper legal standard.  The district court reexamined the record in light of our opinion and again suppressed the evidence for failure to comply with Miranda.   The United States appeals, and we again reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fernandez-Ventura flew from St. Maarten, Netherlands Antilles, to San Juan, Puerto Rico on November 12, 1994.  The Customs Service had Fernandez-Ventura's name on a computerized \"lookout\" list, due to his frequent travel between the two cities.  After Fernandez-Ventura cleared immigration, Customs inspector Rose Espada sent him to the secondary Customs inspection area, where Customs officers Eugene Fischer and Richard Rausch interviewed him and searched his bags.  Officer Fischer asked Fernandez-Ventura whether he was bringing more than $10,000 cash into the United States, and Fernandez-Ventura said, \"No.\" He said he had about $8,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, Officer Rausch found women's clothing in Fernandez-Ventura's bag and asked him why he had it.  Fernandez-Ventura replied that the clothing belonged to his \"mujer\" (\"wife\" or \"woman\"), who was traveling with him.  The inspectors asked Fernandez-Ventura where she was, and he took Fischer to find her.  Milagros Cedeno, Fernandez-Ventura's girlfriend, had already cleared the check point and was waiting inside the Customs enclosure.  Fernandez-Ventura beckoned to Cedeno, and she returned with Fischer and Fernandez-Ventura to the inspection area.  As they walked, Fischer asked Cedeno if she had more than $10,000 in cash, and she replied that she had about $9,000.  Rausch searched Cedeno's purse and found $9,500.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rausch then contacted a supervisor, Hector Alvino, to ask for permission to search Fernandez-Ventura.  Rausch found $6,666 in cash on Fernandez-Ventura.  Alvino then became involved in the questioning.  Alvino asked Fernandez-Ventura who owned the $6,666, and Fernandez-Ventura replied that the money belonged to his money exchange company.  Alvino then asked who owned the $9,500 in Cedeno's possession, and Fernandez-Ventura said that money also belonged to the company.  Fernandez-Ventura said that he was president of the company.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Alvino then sent for a special agent to arrest Fernandez-Ventura.  The agent told Fischer to read Fernandez-Ventura and Cedeno their rights.  They signed Miranda waiver cards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court initially suppressed the statements made after Fischer asked Cedeno if she was carrying any money.  United States v. Fernandez Ventura, 892 F.Supp. 362, 369 (D.Puerto Rico 1995).  The district court held that, since Fernandez-Ventura and Cedeno were not free to leave the interview, they were therefore in custody and entitled to Miranda warnings.  The court wrote, \"Customs is an inherently coercive environment.\"  Id. at 367.   The district court also relied on the officers' state of mind and their belief that they had a \"promising theory of guilt.\"  Id. at 369.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reversed, holding that the district court erred in concluding that Fernandez-Ventura and Cedeno were in custody because they could not leave.  We held:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>Individuals subject to routine traffic stops or customs inspections, circumstances which are not custodial, are rarely free to leave while being questioned by an officer.  The relevant inquiry, however, ... is whether there was an arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ventura I, 85 F.3d at 712.   We further stated that the district court erred in considering the officers' focus on Fernandez-Ventura and Cedeno, which was not relevant to a Miranda inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district court reexamined the custody issue, looking at three factors:  (1) the nature of the surroundings and the extent of police control over the surroundings;  (2) the degree of physical restraint placed on the suspect;  and (3) the duration and character of the questioning.  United States v. Ventura, 947 F.Supp. 25, 29 (D.Puerto Rico 1996).  The district court held that the surroundings were indicative of custody because the officers sent Fernandez-Ventura straight to secondary inspection without first going through primary inspection, and because there were \"four uniformed officers with the defendants at all times, two of whom were armed.\"  Id. at 30.   The court conceded that neither Fernandez-Ventura nor Cedeno was physically restrained, but held that the second factor nevertheless weighed in favor of custody because \"they were unaware of any ability to leave and were in fact unable to leave.\"  Id. Moreover, the court considered it very important that Cedeno had already cleared Customs when the officers asked her to return.  Id. Finally, the court held the duration of the questioning, approximately one hour and twenty minutes, was indicative of custody.  Id. The court again suppressed the statements made after Cedeno was returned to the inspection area.  Id. at 31.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's conclusion that a person is in custody is a mixed question of fact and law, subject to de novo review.  Thompson v. Keohane, 516 U.S. 99, 100-02, 116 S.Ct. 457, 460, 133 L.Ed.2d 383 (1995).  The district court's findings of historical fact concerning the circumstances of the interrogation are reviewed for clear error.  See Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690, ----, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1663, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996).  The ultimate question is whether there was \"a formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\"  Thompson, at 112, 116 S.Ct. at 465 (internal quotation omitted).  The test is not applied mechanically, but in view of the totality of the circumstances.  See id. at 113-15, 116 S.Ct. at 466.   We conclude that the district court once again applied this test erroneously.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most significant circumstance is that this incident occurred in the course of a Customs inspection at our nation's border.  In the context of Customs inspections, our assessment of whether an interrogation is custodial must take into account the strong governmental interest in controlling our borders.  See United States v. Moya, 74 F.3d 1117, 1119 (11th Cir.1996).  \"[Q]uestions from [Customs] officials are especially understood to be a necessary and important routine for travelers arriving at American entry points.  This understanding cuts against the potentially coercive aspect of the Customs inquiry, and lessens the need for Miranda warnings.\"  Ventura I, 85 F.3d at 711 (citations omitted).  The Eleventh Circuit has stated, \"[E]vents which might be enough to signal 'custody' away from the border will not be enough to establish 'custody' in the context of entry into he country.\"  Moya, 74 F.3d at 1120.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its conclusion that the surroundings suggested the defendants were in custody, the district court placed great reliance on the fact that the officers skipped primary inspection and took Fernandez-Ventura directly to secondary inspection.  We said in Ventura I that \"even secondary inspection does not per se constitute custodial interrogation.\"  85 F.3d at 711.   Accord United States v. Pratt, 645 F.2d 89, 90 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 881, 102 S.Ct. 369, 70 L.Ed.2d 195 (1981);  Moya, 74 F.3d at 1120.   Since secondary inspection is not innately custodial, we fail to see how going directly to secondary inspection makes the questioning more coercive.  As a practical matter, this likely reduces the total time the traveler has to spend in Customs, which makes the questioning less coercive, not more.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's opinion on remand stated that the surroundings were coercive because \"there were four uniformed officers with the defendants at all times.\"  947 F.Supp. at 30.   The government pointed out that the officers were not all present simultaneously.  Espada delivered Fernandez-Ventura to Fischer and Rausch, and then left.  Fischer went with Fernandez-Ventura to get Cedeno, and as the three of them walked, Fischer asked Cedeno what cash she was carrying.  After Fischer found the $9,500 on Cedeno, Alvino appeared on the scene.  The district court changed its opinion on reconsideration to say that Fernandez-Ventura and Cedeno were \"guarded by four officers during the course of this incident,\" 947 F.Supp. at 32 (emphasis added), but the court did not change its conclusion that there were too many officers.  We conclude that the early involvement of Espada was inconsequential.  The presence of the three others is not so unusual as to convert a Customs inspection into an arrest.  See United States v. Tajeddini, 996 F.2d 1278, 1281, 1288 (1st Cir.1993) (three Customs officers present;  no custody);  United States v. Park, 947 F.2d 130, 132-33, 138 (1991) (same), vacated in part on other grounds, 951 F.2d 634 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also emphasized the fact that Alvino and Espada were armed.  The court conceded on reconsideration that \"guns were not drawn\" during the incident.  947 F.Supp. at 32.   The testimony at the hearing was that Espada and Alvino were required to be armed as part of their jobs.  The presence of armed officers in this case was simply a part of the Customs routine and not an extraordinary circumstance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though the district court conceded that Fernandez-Ventura and Cedeno were not subjected to physical restraint, it resolved the physical restraint factor against the government for three reasons:  (1) the two were \"in fact unable to leave,\" id. at 30;  (2) Fernandez-Ventura was subjected to a pat-down search, id.;   and (3) Fischer requested that Cedeno return to Customs after she had already passed through, id.   None of these facts bears the weight the district court placed on them.  First, in Ventura I we specifically instructed the district court that it could not infer that travelers were in custody because they were not free simply to walk away from Customs inspectors.  85 F.3d at 712.   Yet, the district court exhibited the same reasoning on remand despite our explicit disapproval.  Next, a pat-down search in a Customs inspection was insufficient to tip the scales against the government in Pratt, 645 F.2d at 91, and there is nothing unusual about the search in this case to give it greater importance here.  Even though Cedeno had passed through the inspection station, she had not left the international border area, with its attendant obligations to cooperate in the Customs process.  Moreover, her traveling companion was still in inspection and she was apparently waiting for him.  Therefore, her progress past the inspection area did not remove her from the Customs context.  Cf. United States v. Wardlaw, 576 F.2d 932, 935 (1st Cir.1978)(applying relaxed standard for search at international border where defendant not only cleared Customs, but also left the airport building before being called back to Customs).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the district court found that the interrogation lasted one hour and twenty minutes.  The district court held, \"This time span ... far exceeds the length of time a reasonable person would endure without feeling restrained.\"  947 F.Supp. at 34.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even the finding of historical fact that the questioning took an hour and twenty minutes is problematic.  The district court found that the interrogation began at 8:10 or 8:15, based on Rausch's testimony about the time of the pat-down of Fernandez-Ventura.  The court found the interrogation ended at 9:40 or 9:45, based on the times stated in the Miranda waiver forms.  Id. However, these do not appear to be the relevant times, since the pat-down search occurred near the end of the questioning.  On the Miranda forms Fernandez-Ventura and Cedeno indicated that they were not detained until 9:10.  The record certainly does not indicate that there was protracted questioning after the pat-down search.  Rather, the witnesses recounted a few straightforward questions, followed by a call for a special agent to come and arrest Fernandez-Ventura and Cedeno.  Therefore, although the record may support the conclusion that one hour and twenty minutes (or more) elapsed during the defendants' encounter with Customs, it does not support the district court's inference that they were therefore subjected to \"focused questioning for nearly an hour and a half.\"  947 F.Supp. at 30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, the district court held that the custody began when Fischer began to question Cedeno.  Id. at 31.   This occurred before the pat-down search, which the district court used as the beginning of the one-hour-twenty-minute period.  We reject the circular reasoning using the lapse of time as a factor in determining that the two were in custody at a point before the one-hour-twenty-minute time period even began.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even if the questioning did take one hour and twenty minutes, we have already concluded that the other circumstances of the questioning were routine.  The duration of the encounter is \"never a singly determinative factor,\" Pratt, 645 F.2d at 91, and the duration in this case was not extraordinary.  We are not prepared to say Customs inspections cannot take this long without becoming an arrest, or even that a delay of this length is strongly indicative of arrest.

The Customs Service had Fernandez-Ventura's name on a computerized \"lookout\" list, due to his frequent travel between the two cities.  After Fernandez-Ventura cleared immigration, Customs inspector Rose Espada sent him to the secondary Customs inspection area, where Customs officers Eugene Fischer and Richard Rausch interviewed him and searched his bags.  Officer Fischer asked Fernandez-Ventura whether he was bringing more than $10,000 cash into the United States, and Fernandez-Ventura said, \"No.\" He said he had about $8,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, Officer Rausch found women's clothing in Fernandez-Ventura's bag and asked him why he had it.  Fernandez-Ventura replied that the clothing belonged to his \"mujer\" (\"wife\" or \"woman\"), who was traveling with him.  The inspectors asked Fernandez-Ventura where she was, and he took Fischer to find her.  Milagros Cedeno, Fernandez-Ventura's girlfriend, had already cleared the check point and was waiting inside the Customs enclosure.  Fernandez-Ventura beckoned to Cedeno, and she returned with Fischer and Fernandez-Ventura to the inspection area.  As they walked, Fischer asked Cedeno if she had more than $10,000 in cash, and she replied that she had about $9,000.  Rausch searched Cedeno's purse and found $9,500.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rausch then contacted a supervisor, Hector Alvino, to ask for permission to search Fernandez-Ventura.  Rausch found $6,666 in cash on Fernandez-Ventura.  Alvino then became involved in the questioning.  Alvino asked Fernandez-Ventura who owned the $6,666, and Fernandez-Ventura replied that the money belonged to his money exchange company.  Alvino then asked who owned the $9,500 in Cedeno's possession, and Fernandez-Ventura said that money also belonged to the company.  Fernandez-Ventura said that he was president of the company.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Alvino then sent for a special agent to arrest Fernandez-Ventura.  The agent told Fischer to read Fernandez-Ventura and Cedeno their rights.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">362</span></a></span>, 369 (D.Puerto Rico 1995).  The district court held that, since Fernandez-Ventura and Cedeno were not free to leave the interview, they were therefore in custody and entitled to Miranda warnings.  The court wrote, \"Customs is an inherently coercive environment.\"  Id. at 367.   The district court also relied on the officers' state of mind and their belief that they had a \"promising theory of guilt.\"  Id. at 369.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reversed, holding that the district court erred in concluding that Fernandez-Ventura and Cedeno were in custody because they could not leave.

We further stated that the district court erred in considering the officers' focus on Fernandez-Ventura and Cedeno, which was not relevant to a Miranda inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district court reexamined the custody issue, looking at three factors:  (1) the nature of the surroundings and the extent of police control over the surroundings;  (2) the degree of physical restraint placed on the suspect;  and (3) the duration and character of the questioning.  United States v. Ventura, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1453776\"><a href=\"/opinion/1453776/united-states-v-ventura/\"><span class=\"volume\">947</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 29 (D.Puerto Rico 1996).  The district court held that the surroundings were indicative of custody because the officers sent Fernandez-Ventura straight to secondary inspection without first going through primary inspection, and because there were \"four uniformed officers with the defendants at all times, two of whom were armed.\"  Id. at 30.   The court conceded that neither Fernandez-Ventura nor Cedeno was physically restrained, but held that the second factor nevertheless weighed in favor of custody because \"they were unaware of any ability to leave and were in fact unable to leave.\"  Id. Moreover, the court considered it very important that Cedeno had already cleared Customs when the officers asked her to return.  Id. Finally, the court held the duration of the questioning, approximately one hour and twenty minutes, was indicative of custody.  Id. The court again suppressed the statements made after Cedeno was returned to the inspection area.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span></a></span> (1995).  The district court's findings of historical fact concerning the circumstances of the interrogation are reviewed for clear error.  See Ornelas v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118030\"><a href=\"/opinion/118030/ornelas-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">690</span></a></span>, ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118030\"><a href=\"/opinion/118030/ornelas-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">911</span></a></span> (1996).  The ultimate question is whether there was \"a formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\"  Thompson, at 112, 116 S.Ct. at 465 (internal quotation omitted).  The test is not applied mechanically, but in view of the totality of the circumstances.  See id. at 113-15, 116 S.Ct. at 466.   We conclude that the district court once again applied this test erroneously.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most significant circumstance is that this incident occurred in the course of a Customs inspection at our nation's border.  In the context of Customs inspections, our assessment of whether an interrogation is custodial must take into account the strong governmental interest in controlling our borders.  See United States v. Moya, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"70717\"><a href=\"/opinion/70717/united-states-v-moya/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1117</span></a></span>, 1119 (11th Cir.1996).  \"[Q]uestions from [Customs] officials are especially understood to be a necessary and important routine for travelers arriving at American entry points.  This understanding cuts against the potentially coercive aspect of the Customs inquiry, and lessens the need for Miranda warnings.\"  Ventura I, 85 F.3d at 711 (citations omitted).  The Eleventh Circuit has stated, \"[E]vents which might be enough to signal 'custody' away from the border will not be enough to establish 'custody' in the context of entry into he country.\"  Moya, 74 F.3d at 1120.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its conclusion that the surroundings suggested the defendants were in custody, the district court placed great reliance on the fact that the officers skipped primary inspection and took Fernandez-Ventura directly to secondary inspection.  We said in Ventura I that \"even secondary inspection does not per se constitute custodial interrogation.\"  85 F.3d at 711.   Accord United States v. Pratt, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"389100\"><a href=\"/opinion/389100/united-states-v-james-j-pratt/\"><span class=\"volume\">645</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span>, 90 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">881</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">195</span></span> (1981);  Moya, 74 F.3d at 1120.   Since secondary inspection is not innately custodial, we fail to see how going directly to secondary inspection makes the questioning more coercive.  As a practical matter, this likely reduces the total time the traveler has to spend in Customs, which makes the questioning less coercive, not more.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's opinion on remand stated that the surroundings were coercive because \"there were four uniformed officers with the defendants at all times.\"  947 F.Supp. at 30.   The government pointed out that the officers were not all present simultaneously.  Espada delivered Fernandez-Ventura to Fischer and Rausch, and then left.  Fischer went with Fernandez-Ventura to get Cedeno, and as the three of them walked, Fischer asked Cedeno what cash she was carrying.  After Fischer found the $9,500 on Cedeno, Alvino appeared on the scene.  The district court changed its opinion on reconsideration to say that Fernandez-Ventura and Cedeno were \"guarded by four officers during the course of this incident,\" 947 F.Supp. at 32 (emphasis added), but the court did not change its conclusion that there were too many officers.  We conclude that the early involvement of Espada was inconsequential.  The presence of the three others is not so unusual as to convert a Customs inspection into an arrest.  See United States v. Tajeddini, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610547\"><a href=\"/opinion/610547/united-states-v-hojatollah-tajeddini/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1278</span></a></span>, 1281, 1288 (1st Cir.1993) (three Customs officers present;  no custody);  United States v. Park, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">947</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></span>, 132-33, 138 (1991) (same), vacated in part on other grounds, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573905\"><a href=\"/opinion/573905/united-states-v-peter-park/\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">634</span></a></span> (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also emphasized the fact that Alvino and Espada were armed.  The court conceded on reconsideration that \"guns were not drawn\" during the incident.  947 F.Supp. at 32.   The testimony at the hearing was that Espada and Alvino were required to be armed as part of their jobs.  The presence of armed officers in this case was simply a part of the Customs routine and not an extraordinary circumstance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though the district court conceded that Fernandez-Ventura and Cedeno were not subjected to physical restraint, it resolved the physical restraint factor against the government for three reasons:  (1) the two were \"in fact unable to leave,\" id. at 30;  (2) Fernandez-Ventura was subjected to a pat-down search, id.;   and (3) Fischer requested that Cedeno return to Customs after she had already passed through, id.   None of these facts bears the weight the district court placed on them.  First, in Ventura I we specifically instructed the district court that it could not infer that travelers were in custody because they were not free simply to walk away from Customs inspectors.  85 F.3d at 712.   Yet, the district court exhibited the same reasoning on remand despite our explicit disapproval.  Next, a pat-down search in a Customs inspection was insufficient to tip the scales against the government in Pratt, 645 F.2d at 91, and there is nothing unusual about the search in this case to give it greater importance here.  Even though Cedeno had passed through the inspection station, she had not left the international border area, with its attendant obligations to cooperate in the Customs process.  Moreover, her traveling companion was still in inspection and she was apparently waiting for him.  Therefore, her progress past the inspection area did not remove her from the Customs context.  Cf. United States v. Wardlaw, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"355997\"><a href=\"/opinion/355997/united-states-v-wendy-jean-wardlaw-etc-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">576</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">932</span></a></span>, 935 (1st Cir.1978)(applying relaxed standard for search at international border where defendant not only cleared Customs, but also left the airport building before being called back to Customs).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the district court found that the interrogation lasted one hour and twenty minutes.  The district court held, \"This time span ... far exceeds the length of time a reasonable person would endure without feeling restrained.\"  947 F.Supp. at 34.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even the finding of historical fact that the questioning took an hour and twenty minutes is problematic.  The district court found that the interrogation began at 8:10 or 8:15, based on Rausch's testimony about the time of the pat-down of Fernandez-Ventura.  The court found the interrogation ended at 9:40 or 9:45, based on the times stated in the Miranda waiver forms.  Id. However, these do not appear to be the relevant times, since the pat-down search occurred near the end of the questioning.  On the Miranda forms Fernandez-Ventura and Cedeno indicated that they were not detained until 9:10.  The record certainly does not indicate that there was protracted questioning after the pat-down search.  Rather, the witnesses recounted a few straightforward questions, followed by a call for a special agent to come and arrest Fernandez-Ventura and Cedeno.  Therefore, although the record may support the conclusion that one hour and twenty minutes (or more) elapsed during the defendants' encounter with Customs, it does not support the district court's inference that they were therefore subjected to \"focused questioning for nearly an hour and a half.\"  947 F.Supp. at 30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, the district court held that the custody began when Fischer began to question Cedeno.  Id. at 31.   This occurred before the pat-down search, which the district court used as the beginning of the one-hour-twenty-minute period.  We reject the circular reasoning using the lapse of time as a factor in determining that the two were in custody at a point before the one-hour-twenty-minute time period even began.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even if the questioning did take one hour and twenty minutes, we have already concluded that the other circumstances of the questioning were routine.  The duration of the encounter is \"never a singly determinative factor,\" Pratt, 645 F.2d at 91, and the duration in this case was not extraordinary.  We are not prepared to say Customs inspections cannot take this long without becoming an arrest, or even that a delay of this length is strongly indicative of arrest.  See Park, 947 F.2d at 133, 138 (no arrest where Customs inspection lasted three to four hours).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the factors cited by the district court do not distinguish this case from a routine Customs inspection so as to support the court's conclusion that Fernandez-Ventura and Cedeno were in custody.  We remand for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eleventh Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s-s_ref\">**</a>\n        <p> Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Miranda v.
