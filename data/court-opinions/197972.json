Juan M. Perez-Gimenez, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                  Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n             Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n               and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n Raymond Rivera Esteves and Juan A. Hernandez Rivera on brief\r\nfor appellant.\r\n Honorable Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Lilliam\r\nMendoza Toro, Assistant United States Attorney, and Donna McCarthy,\r\nAssistant Regional Counsel, Social Security Administration, on\r\nbrief for appellee.\r\n\nMay 27, 1998\r\n\n        Per Curiam.  Appellant Awilda De-La-Cruz-Arroyo\r\nappeals from the dismissal of her action for lack of\r\nprosecution.  Specifically, process never was served on the\r\ndefendant, the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\r\n          The district court did not abuse its discretion in\r\nordering dismissal of the case after nine months had passed\r\nwithout service and without any other action on appellant's\r\npart to move the case forward.  See Caribbean Transp. Sys.,\r\nInc. v. Autoridad de las Navieras de Puerto Rico, 901 F.2d 196,\r\n197 (1st Cir. 1990) (affirming the dismissal of plaintiffs'\r\ncase where they failed to serve the amended complaint for seven\r\nmonths and did little to move the action along).  The question\r\nthen becomes whether the district court abused its discretion\r\nin denying appellant's request, made in her Fed. R. Civ. P.\r\n60(b) motion, for an extension of time in which to serve the\r\nSecretary.  We think not.  \r\n          Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m), an extension of time for\r\nservice of process is permitted upon a showing of \"good cause.\" \r\nIt is appellant's burden to demonstrate the requisite cause. \r\nSee United States v. Ayer, 857 F.2d 881, 884-85 (1st Cir. 1988). \r\nHere, the error made by appellant's attorney shows\r\ninadvertence.  However, this is not enough to require the\r\ndistrict court to grant an extension under Rule 4.  See Powellv. Starwalt, 866 F.2d 964, 965 (7th Cir. 1989) (rejecting\r\nattorney inadvertence as amounting to \"good cause\" under Rule\r\n4(j), the predecessor to Rule 4(m)); Braxton v. United States,\r\n817 F.2d 238, 239 (3rd Cir. 1987) (same). \r\n          Counsel argues that he nonetheless acted diligently\r\nby reviewing the case and filing the motion in June 1997,\r\nasking to be notified when the court decided the case.  Rather\r\nthan exhibiting diligence, however, this motion underscores the\r\nwant of prosecution.  Specifically, we think that any\r\nreasonable review of the case should have revealed, in addition\r\nto the lack of a decision, the absence of an answer or other\r\nresponsive pleading from the Secretary.  In turn, this should\r\nhave alerted appellant's attorney to the possibility that the\r\nSecretary never had been served.\r\n          We find the lack of any explanation, even now, for\r\nappellant's inactivity from June 18, 1997 until the case was\r\ndismissed on September 26, 1997 dispositive.  See Resolution\r\nTrust Corp. v. Starkey, 41 F.3d 1018, 1022 (5th Cir. 1995) (good\r\ncause for failure to timely serve defendant was lacking where\r\nplaintiff offered no explanation for not having acted\r\ndiligently in discovering defendant's address).  That appellant\r\nwas not proceeding in bad faith is not controlling.  See id.(lack of a \"sinister motive\" is not enough to excuse delay in\r\nfailing to serve defendant).  Rather, \"the fact that\r\n[appellant] was careless is sufficient to militate against the\r\nshowing of good faith required for shelter under\" Rule 4.   Seeid.\r\n          Affirmed.\n",
