Plaintiff  Shawn  Flynn  appeals from  a\r                    Per  Curiam\r                               \r\n\nsummary judgment order dismissing his Americans With Disabilities\r\n\nAct (\"ADA\") claim against Raytheon Company for refusing to rehire\r\n\nhim after he had completed his fourth inpatient treatment program\r\n\nfor alcoholism.  Following careful  review of the entire  record,\r\n\nwe affirm the district court judgment.\r\n\n          Over   approximately  nine  years,  Flynn  compiled  an\r\n\nemployment   record   marred   repeatedly    by   alcohol-related\r\n\nabsenteeism and  tardiness, interspersed with  numerous sanctions\r\n\nand  renewed  opportunities   to  meet  Raytheon's  minimum   job\r\n\nrequirements.  Raytheon  finally fired him for  reporting to work\r\n\nwhile  under the influence of alcohol, in direct violation of its\r\n\nwork  rules.  See also 42 U.S.C.    12114(c)(1), (2), (4).  After\r                                \r\n\ncompleting   the  fourth   inpatient  treatment   program,  Flynn\r\n\npresented Raytheon  with a  progress report from  his supervising\r\n\nphysician,  proposed to  submit  to random  alcohol testing,  and\r\n\nrequested reinstatement.  When Raytheon declined, Flynn filed the\r\n\npresent action.   The  district court ultimately  granted summary\r\n\njudgment for Raytheon, and Flynn appealed.\r\n\n          Flynn does  not contend that Raytheon  violated the ADA\r\n\nby  firing him,  nor could  he  do so  successfully.   See id.   \r                                                                        \r\n\n12114(c)(4) (acknowledging that employer  may \"hold an employee .\r\n\n. . who  is an alcoholic to the  same qualification standards for\r\n\nemployment or  job performance and  behavior [as it]  holds other\r\n\nemployees, even if any  unsatisfactory performance or behavior is\r\n\nrelated to  the .  . .  alcoholism of  such employee  . .  . .\").\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nInstead, he maintains that Raytheon's refusal to give him another\r                                                                           \r\n\nchance,  by rehiring  him  on the  terms  he proposed,  including\r                \r\n\nrandom alcohol testing, violated the ADA.\r\n\n          Flynn  seems to  contend  that  Raytheon  conditionally\r\n\nagreed  to   rehire  him   subject  to  evidence   of  successful\r\n\nrehabilitation.   He  relies on  a statement  made by  a Raytheon\r\n\nrepresentative during  the union  grievance proceeding that  took\r\n\nplace following  his  firing and  his  completion of  the  fourth\r\n\ninpatient treatment program.   Flynn states that he was  told \"it\r\n\nwas too soon for [him to  return to work, and if [he received]  a\r\n\npaycheck [he would] just  . . .  go out and get drunk again.\"  At\r\n\nthe  same time, according  to Flynn, he  was told that  \"once [he\r\n\nhad]  proved  [him]self  then  things  could  happen.\"  (emphasis\r                                                      \r\n\nadded).   He  maintains  that these  representations generated  a\r\n\ntrialworthy issue as to  whether Raytheon would have rehired  him\r\n\nif it believed he was or could be rehabilitated.  \r\n\n          The district court  correctly concluded that Flynn  did\r\n\nnot  generate a trialworthy issue  of material fact.   First, the\r\n\nlanguage Flynn attributes to the Raytheon representative    \"once\r\n\n[Flynn  had]  proved  [him]self  then things  could  happen.\"    \r                                                             \r\n\nconstituted  neither a promise that \"things  would happen\" if and\r                                                            \r\n\nwhen  he proved himself, nor  an evaluative assessment that Flynn\r\n\nhad yet proven himself, especially in the extant temporal context\r\n\ndescribed by  the same Raytheon representative; viz., \"it was too\r                                                              \r\n\nsoon for [Flynn to return to work and if [he received] a paycheck\r\n\n[he would]  just .  . . go  out and get  drunk again.\"   Although\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nFlynn plainly would  prefer the cart  before the horse,  Raytheon\r\n\nacceded to no such arrangement.         Even     assuming     the\r\n\nlanguage relied upon were subject to the interpretation  urged by\r\n\nFlynn, however, it would not give rise to an ADA  claim.  Flynn's\r\n\ncontention confuses  a conditional  promise to consider  a future\r                                                                           \r\n\nrequest to  rehire with a putative ADA-based obligation to rehire\r                                                                 \r\n\nat present.   The ADA does  not require an  employer to rehire  a\r                    \r\n\nformer  employee   who  was  lawfully  discharged   for  repeated\r\n\ndisability-related   failures   to   meet  its   legitimate   job\r\n\nrequirements; viz., punctuality  and sobriety.   See 42 U.S.C.   \r                                                              \r\n\n12114(c); see  also Siefken v.  Village of Arlington  Heights, 65\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d 664, 666 (7th Cir. 1995) (\"A  second chance . . . is not  an\r\n\naccommodation,  as envisioned  in the ADA.\")  (internal quotation\r\n\nmarks  omitted) (rejecting ADA  claim by  employee who  failed to\r\n\nmonitor  his diabetes  despite employer's  legitimate expectation\r\n\nthat  he would  do  so).   As the  Seventh  Circuit explained  in\r\n\nSiefken, since  the discharged  employee was not  asking for  any\r                 \r\n\n\"accommodation\" within  the contemplation of the  ADA, but simply\r\n\n\"another   chance  to   allow  him   to  change   his  monitoring\r                                            \r\n\ntechnique[,]\"  the ADA did not require the employer to afford him\r\n\nanother chance.  Id. at 666-67.  \r                              \r\n\n          Finally, Flynn  cites no  authority for the  claim that\r\n\nthe  ADA entitles  him to  a \"second  chance\" to  meet Raytheon's\r\n\nlegitimate  work  requirements, see  id.,  nor  for claiming,  if\r                                                  \r\n\nindeed he does, that a conditional promise to reconsider based on\r\n\na  future rehiring request  gave rise to  an actionable ADA-based\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nclaim, cf.  Myers  v.

Flynn states that he was  told \"it\r\n\nwas too soon for [him to  return to work, and if [he received]  a\r\n\npaycheck [he would] just  . . .  go out and get drunk again.\"  At\r\n\nthe  same time, according  to Flynn, he  was told that  \"once [he\r\n\nhad]  proved  [him]self  then  things  could  happen.\"  (emphasis\r                                                      \r\n\nadded).   He  maintains  that these  representations generated  a\r\n\ntrialworthy issue as to  whether Raytheon would have rehired  him\r\n\nif it believed he was or could be rehabilitated.  \r\n\n          The district court  correctly concluded that Flynn  did\r\n\nnot  generate a trialworthy issue  of material fact.   First, the\r\n\nlanguage Flynn attributes to the Raytheon representative    \"once\r\n\n[Flynn  had]  proved  [him]self  then things  could  happen.\"    \r                                                             \r\n\nconstituted  neither a promise that \"things  would happen\" if and\r                                                            \r\n\nwhen  he proved himself, nor  an evaluative assessment that Flynn\r\n\nhad yet proven himself, especially in the extant temporal context\r\n\ndescribed by  the same Raytheon representative; viz., \"it was too\r                                                              \r\n\nsoon for [Flynn to return to work and if [he received] a paycheck\r\n\n[he would]  just .  . . go  out and get  drunk again.\"   Although\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nFlynn plainly would  prefer the cart  before the horse,  Raytheon\r\n\nacceded to no such arrangement.         Even     assuming     the\r\n\nlanguage relied upon were subject to the interpretation  urged by\r\n\nFlynn, however, it would not give rise to an ADA  claim.  Flynn's\r\n\ncontention confuses  a conditional  promise to consider  a future\r                                                                           \r\n\nrequest to  rehire with a putative ADA-based obligation to rehire\r                                                                 \r\n\nat present.   The ADA does  not require an  employer to rehire  a\r                    \r\n\nformer  employee   who  was  lawfully  discharged   for  repeated\r\n\ndisability-related   failures   to   meet  its   legitimate   job\r\n\nrequirements; viz., punctuality  and sobriety.   See 42 U.S.C.   \r                                                              \r\n\n12114(c); see  also Siefken v.

Id. at 666-67.  \r                              \r\n\n          Finally, Flynn  cites no  authority for the  claim that\r\n\nthe  ADA entitles  him to  a \"second  chance\" to  meet Raytheon's\r\n\nlegitimate  work  requirements, see  id.,  nor  for claiming,  if\r                                                  \r\n\nindeed he does, that a conditional promise to reconsider based on\r\n\na  future rehiring request  gave rise to  an actionable ADA-based\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nclaim, cf.
