CANNON AND WILLIAM L. BLAGG,\r\n\n                         Petitioners.\r\n\n ON PETITION FOR MANDAMUS TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n           FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND AND THE\r\n\nUNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND\r\n\n           [Hon. Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n    [Hon. Arthur N. Votolato, Jr., U.S. Bankruptcy Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                  Selya, Boudin and Stahl,\r\n\n                      Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Robert B. Mann and Mann &amp; Mitchell on brief for petitioner\r\nBlagg.\r\n   Carter G. Phillips, James C. Stansel and Sidley &amp; Austin on\r\nbrief for petitioner Cannon.\r\n\nMarch 30, 1999\r\n\nPer Curiam.  Petitioners, Charles J. Cannon and William\r\nL. Blagg, are government attorneys who seek to vacate certain\r\nunflattering comments made by a bankruptcy judge in the course of\r\ntwo published opinions.  See In re Williams, 188 B.R. 721 (Bankr.\r\nD.R.I. 1995); In re Williams, 181 B.R. 1 (Bankr. D.R.I. 1995). \r\nPetitioners originally mounted an offensive on two fronts to\r\ncounteract these opinions; they appealed to the district court,\r\nclaiming that the bankruptcy judge's adverse comments amounted to\r\n\"sanctions,\" and they simultaneously asked the district court for\r\nmandamus relief.  The district court rejected both overtures.  SeeIn re Williams, 215 B.R. 289 (D.R.I. 1997).  Petitioners then\r\nappealed to this court, but in so doing, they failed to renew their\r\nrequest for relief by way of mandamus.  See In re Williams, 156\r\nF.3d 86, 93 (1st Cir. 1998).\r\nWe dismissed petitioners' appeals on the ground that the\r\nbankruptcy judge's comments did not constitute an appealable\r\njudgment or order.  See id. at 92.  Petitioners' application for\r\nrehearing en banc was denied by an equally divided court.  They\r\nthen filed both an application for certiorari in the United States\r\nSupreme Court and an original petition for mandamus in this court. \r\nWe held the latter petition in abeyance pending Supreme Court\r\naction.  On January 25, 1999, the Supreme Court denied certiorari. \r\nSee Cannon v. Williams, 119 S. Ct. 905 (1999).  Petitioners then\r\nrequested that we act on their mandamus petition.  We do so today.\r\nWe believe that petitioners, by asking the district court\r\nfor mandamus relief and then failing to appeal the district court's\r\ndenial of that relief, effectively forfeited any right they may\r\nhave had to ask this court to consider the propriety of mandamus. \r\nIn all events, mandamus is an inherently discretionary writ, and we\r\nare unwilling to exercise discretion in favor of parties who had an \r\nample opportunity to pursue a point, but elected not to press it in\r\nthe ordinary course.\r\nWe need go no further.  The petition for writ of mandamus\r\nis denied.\n",
