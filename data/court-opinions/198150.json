CHATER, COMMISSIONER,\r\n             SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION,\r\n\n                   Defendant, Appellee.\r\n\n       APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n             FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND\r\n\n    [Hon. Robert W. Lovegreen, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                 Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n             Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n               and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n Donna M. Nesselbush and Green, Greenberg &amp; Nesselbush on brief\r\nfor appellant.\r\n Sheldon Whitehouse, United States Attorney, Mary E. Rodgers,\r\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, and Wayne G. Lewis, Assistant Regional\r\nCounsel, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nSeptember 30, 1998\r\n\n        Per Curiam.   Appellant Francisca Colon appeals from\r\nthe district court's decision affirming the final decision of\r\nthe Commissioner of Social Security which denied her disability\r\ninsurance benefits under the Social Security Act.  After\r\nreviewing the administrative record, we conclude that\r\nsubstantial evidence supported the denial of benefits,\r\nessentially for the reasons given by the district court in its\r\ndecision.  In particular, we note that the district court\r\ncorrectly construed the medical record, which showed that both\r\nof appellant's treating physicians, rheumatologist Dr. Edward\r\nLally and orthopedist Dr. Howard Hirsch, ultimately viewed her\r\npain to be muscular in origin and that both rejected the view\r\nthat it was due to her clavicular non-union.  We make only the\r\nfollowing additional comments which relate to claims of error\r\nnot directly addressed by the district court.\r\n               1.  We do not think that Social Security Ruling\r\n96-5p required the administrative law judge (\"ALJ\") to\r\nrecontact Dr. Hirsch to clarify the basis for his opinion that\r\nthe appellant was disabled from December 1993 to December 1994. \r\nUnder the Ruling, the ALJ was required to do so only if he\r\ncould not \"ascertain the basis of the opinion from the case\r\nrecord.\"  The record contained a questionnaire, filled out by\r\nDr. Hirsch in July 1995, which stated the basis for his opinion\r\nthat the appellant was disabled.\r\n               2.  We see no error in the ALJ's failure to\r\nexplain in detail why he discredited the appellant's testimony\r\nas to her pain.  He does not appear to have discredited the\r\nspecific facts to which she testified, since he determined that\r\nshe had a severe impairment which prevented her from performing\r\nher past work.  Rather, he apparently declined only to draw the\r\nultimate conclusion that her pain left her totally disabled,\r\noffering legitimate reasons for doing so.  Nor do we agree that\r\nhe mischaracterized her testimony regarding her daily\r\nactivities.  Based on her testimony, the ALJ could reasonably\r\ninfer that, as the only adult regularly present, she cared for\r\nher two young children who lived with her; that she could drive\r\n(she stated only that she was not driving at the time of the\r\nhearing because she did not have a car); that she could shop\r\n(she testified only that her son lifted the \"heavier\" things);\r\nand that she could do some household cleaning (she stated only\r\nthat she had \"difficulty\" cleaning, that she asked her younger\r\nson to sweep the floor, and that her adult son, who lived in a\r\ndifferent state, did general cleaning when he was there). \r\nWhile she did not testify that she visited with friends\r\nregularly, she did report that fact in her disability\r\napplications.  Finally, the appellant has not shown that the\r\nALJ failed to make the inquiries required by Avery v. Sec'y of\r\nHealth &amp; Human Serv., 797 F.2d 19 (1st Cir. 1986).\r\n               3.  The ALJ had no need to consult a medical\r\nexpert because the record contained several medical opinions on\r\nappellant's functional capacity.  Both Dr. Lally and Dr. Hirsch\r\noffered opinions, and the Commissioner's consulting, non-\r\nexamining physician, Dr. Richard Mignacci, filled out a\r\nresidual capacity assessment form.  While appellant's treating\r\nphysicians differed in their opinions on her functional\r\ncapacity, the ALJ reasonably explained why Dr. Lally's opinion\r\nshould be preferred.\r\n               4.  The hypothetical, which appellant's counsel\r\nposed to the vocational expert at the disability hearing, was\r\npremised in part on the assumption that appellant's ability to\r\ngrasp with her dominant right hand was limited.  Because this\r\nrestriction was not supported by the medical evidence, the ALJ\r\ndid not err in ignoring the expert's response to counsel's\r\nhypothetical.\r\n               The decision of the district court is affirmed.\r\n",
