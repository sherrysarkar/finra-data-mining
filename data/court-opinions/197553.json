Alvin Acord  suffered injuries\r                                       \r\n\nwhile employed by  Bath Iron Works Corporation,  and obtained\r\n\nbenefits  after state workers'  compensation proceedings.  He\r\n\nthen sought and received a  further award under the Longshore\r\n\nAct,  33 U.S.C.    901 et seq.   On this appeal, we hold that\r                                          \r\n\nthe federal award was barred by collateral estoppel, and, for\r\n\nthe  benefit  of  future litigants,  we  address  briefly the\r\n\nalternative statute  of limitations  defense advanced  by the\r\n\npetitioner insurer.\r\n\n     The events and procedural history are complicated, but a\r\n\ncondensed version will set the scene.   Acord began work as a\r\n\ntest electrician at Bath in 1974.  In 1982 he suffered upper-\r\n\nbody injuries  and in 1983,  a knee injury and  knee surgery;\r\n\nand  in 1984  he was transferred  to a  desk job.   He sought\r\n\ndisability  benefits  under the  Maine  Workers' Compensation\r\n\nAct, 39  Me. Rev.  Stat. Ann.    1  et seq.  (1989), and,  in\r                                                       \r\n\nOctober  1987,  was  awarded  25  percent partial  disability\r\n\nbenefits.  \r\n\n     Between  1983 and  1987, Acord experienced  a half-dozen\r\n\nincidents  of trauma  to his  knee  wherein some  provocation\r\n\nwould cause  the knee to  give way; one incident  occurred in\r\n\nJune 1987,  when Acord  stubbed his toe  and then  jammed his\r\n\nknee as he rose from his desk.  Acord underwent further  knee\r\n\nsurgery and  returned to his  desk job in November  1987, now\r\n\nworking only four  hours a day based on  his doctor's advice.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nDegenerative  arthritis in his knee joints indicated that his\r\n\ncondition would worsen.\r\n\n     One  year  later,  in  November  1988,   Bath's  company\r\n\nphysician told Acord that he was being let go.  The record is\r\n\nmurky  but it  was  apparently Acord's  own opinion  that the\r\n\ncoming winter  would  aggravate  his knee,  and  it  was  the\r\n\ndoctor's view that there would be no  suitable work available\r\n\nif  Acord's physical restrictions increased.  Acord has since\r\n\nsought reemployment at Bath, without success.\r\n\n     Birmingham Fire Insurance  Company (\"Birmingham\"), which\r\n\nprovided Bath's  insurance coverage at  the time of  the June\r\n\n1987 injury,  began to  pay Acord  total disability  benefits\r\n\nwhen he was dismissed in  November 1988.  But Birmingham also\r\n\npetitioned the Maine workers'  compensation agency, asking it\r\n\nto  declare that the insurer  had no continuing liability for\r\n\nthe June 1987 injury.  In February 1989, after an evidentiary\r\n\nproceeding, a  Maine  commissioner held  that Birmingham  had\r\n\nproven  that the  June  1987  incident  did  not  permanently\r\n\ncontribute to Acord's  condition; this decision  was affirmed\r\n\nby the commission's appellate division in September 1990.\r\n\n     In  related proceedings, Acord asked the Maine agency to\r\n\nincrease his  previous and  continuing 25  percent disability\r\n\naward  based  on  the  1983  injury;  Acord  urged  that  his\r\n\ncondition   had  worsened  since   1983.     After  extensive\r\n\nproceedings,  the Maine agency  ruled in  June 1992  that the\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\noriginal  disability  payment  should   be  increased  to  50\r\n\npercent, representing  increased disability  since 1983,  and\r\n\nthat the payments should be made by Liberty Mutual  Insurance\r\n\nCompany.  Liberty Mutual had  been Bath's insurer at the time\r\n\nof the June 1983 injury.\r\n\n     Shortly  before this  new ruling,  Acord  in March  1992\r\n\nfiled for  federal workers'  compensation benefits  under the\r\n\nLongshore Act.  It is not uncommon for employees connected to\r\n\nmaritime  affairs  to be  covered by  both federal  and state\r\n\ncompensation statutes, and federal jurisdiction in  this case\r\n\nhas not been disputed.  In the federal proceeding, Acord took\r\n\nthe  position that  his  June  1987  injury entitled  him  to\r\n\npermanent  total disability  benefits  because  it  left  him\r\n\nunable  to fill  the  material handler  position that  he had\r\n\npreviously held.\r\n\n     Birmingham  resisted Acord's  federal claim  on multiple\r\n\ngrounds: that  the claim, filed  almost five years  after the\r\n\nincident,  was  barred  by the  federal  one-year  statute of\r\n\nlimitations,  33  U.S.C.     913;  that  collateral  estoppel\r\n\nprecluded Acord from  claiming permanent injury based  on the\r\n\nJune 1987  incident; and that the medical  evidence failed to\r\n\nsupport  such  a claim  of  permanent  injury based  on  that\r\n\nincident.  A  federal administrative law judge  took evidence\r\n\non  the  federal  claim,  reserving  judgment  on  the  legal\r\n\ndefenses.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\n     In September  1993, the  federal ALJ  issued a  decision\r\n\nawarding permanent total  disability benefits  to Acord,  and\r\n\nagainst Birmingham,  from and after Acord's last  day at work\r\n\nin  November  1988.   The  decision  rejected  the collateral\r\n\nestoppel  and  statute of  limitations  defenses, on  grounds\r\n\ndescribed below, and  concluded on the  merits that the  June\r\n\n1987 incident had  caused a permanent further  aggravation in\r\n\nAcord's knee condition.  \r\n\n     Birmingham sought review  by the  Department of  Labor's\r\n\nBenefits Review Board,  33 U.S.C.   921(b), but  the Benefits\r\n\nReview  Board took  no action  on  the matter.   Because  the\r\n\nmatter had been pending before the Benefits Review Board  for\r\n\nmore than one year and the Benefits Review Board had taken no\r\n\naction on it, it became final for purposes of judicial review\r\n\nin  September 1996.   Pub.  L. 104-134,    101(d),  110 Stat.\r\n\n1321-219  (1996).    Birmingham then  sought  review  in this\r\n\ncourt.   See 33 U.S.C.    921(c).   Acord,  needless to  say,\r                        \r\n\nsupports the ALJ's decision.\r\n\n     We agree  with Birmingham  that the  federal ALJ  should\r\n\nhave given collateral  estoppel effect to the  Maine agency's\r\n\ndetermination, in its  February 1989 decision, that  the June\r\n\n1987 injury \"had no lasting effect on Mr. Acord's condition.\"\r\n\nThe  state agency finding, in turn, precludes Acord's present\r\n\nclaim.   Only the  first of  these two propositions  requires\r\n\nmuch discussion.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\n     Often, respect for  a prior judgment is mandated  by the\r\n\nfull faith and credit  clause, U.S. Const. art.  IV,   1,  or\r\n\nits  statutory  counterpart, 28  U.S.C.    1738.    A literal\r\n\nreader  might doubt  that  either  has much  to  do with  the\r\n\npresent  case,  because  (among  other  reasons)  the  former\r\n\nconstrains  states, not federal  entities, and the  latter is\r\n\ndirected  explicitly to federal courts and says nothing about\r\n\nfederal  agencies.    But the  policy  arguments  for similar\r\n\ntreatment--especially avoidance  of duplicative  litigation--\r\n\ntend to be the same.\r\n\n     Without dwelling overmuch on the rationale, the  Supreme\r\n\nCourt  has  instructed  that \"federal  courts  must  give the\r\n\n[state] agency's  factfinding the  same preclusive effect  to\r\n\nwhich   it  would  be   entitled  in  the   State's  courts.\"\r\n\nUniversity of Tennessee v. Elliott, 478 U.S. 788, 799 (1986).\r                                              \r\n\nOrdinarily, the  state  agency must  have been  acting in  an\r\n\nadjudicative capacity, United States v. Utah Constr. &amp; Mining\r                                                                         \r\n\nCo.,  384  U.S.  394,  422  (1966),  but  that  condition  is\r               \r\n\nsatisfied in  this case.   And Maine  does treat  such agency\r\n\nfindings as a proper basis  for precluding relitigation.  Van\r                                                                         \r\n\nHouten v.

Yet  Elliott  itself relied  heavily  upon  Thomas v.\r                                                                      \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nWashington Gas Light Co., 448 U.S. 261, 281 (1980), where the\r                                    \r\n\nSupreme Court said that an  agency finding in one state could\r\n\nbind another  state's agency under the full  faith and credit\r\n\nclause.   Elliott, 478 U.S.  at 798-99.  And  several circuit\r                             \r\n\ndecisions  have held that a federal  agency is normally bound\r\n\nto  respect  findings  by another  agency  acting  within its\r\n\ncompetence.

See  18 Wright &amp; Miller,\r                                                    \r\n\nFederal Practice  and  Procedure    4475,  at  762-63  &amp;  n.3\r                                            \r\n\n(1981).  Here, no conflict exists between the tendency of the\r\n\ncourts and the position  of the agency involved, because  the\r\n\nBenefits  Review Board  itself  has declared  that collateral\r\n\nestoppel effect  is to  be given under  the Longshore  Act to\r\n\nappropriate   findings    of   \"other   state    or   federal\r\n\nadministrative tribunals.\"   Barlow v.

He  argues that\r\n\ndifferences  in  burdens  of proof,  and  in  the substantive\r\n\nstandards, under  the Maine and federal  compensation schemes\r\n\nmake collateral estoppel inappropriate.  These are legitimate\r\n\narguments, but they ultimately do not succeed in this case.\r\n\n     It  is quite true that collateral estoppel effect may be\r\n\ndenied  because  of  differences  in  burden  of  proof  (for\r\n\nexample, where  the victor  in the first  case has  a greater\r\n\nburden in the second).

Here, Birmingham,\r                               \r\n\nby  seeking a  judgment from  Maine  limiting its  liability,\r\n\nundertook  the burden  of  proving,  by  a  preponderance  of\r\n\nevidence,  that the  June  1987  incident  had  no  permanent\r\n\neffect.  See Nichols v.

See Sun  Ship, Inc.  v.\r                                                                     \r\nPennsylvania,  447  U.S.  715, 722  (1980).

The Maine  agency concluded that this burden had\r\n\nbeen carried.\r\n\n     In the  federal  agency proceeding,  Birmingham bore  no\r\n\nheavier burden;  if anything,  it had a  lighter one.   Acord\r\n\nhimself  had the burden of proving  permanent injury from the\r\n\nJune 1987 incident,  although he was  aided by a  conditioned\r\n\nfederal  presumption   that  \"the  claim  comes   within  the\r\n\nprovisions  of this  chapter.\"   33  U.S.C.    920(a).   This\r\n\npresumption   merely   requires   an   employer  to   provide\r\n\n\"substantial  evidence\" that the  accident did not  cause the\r\n\nharm,   and  then  the   presumption  vanishes.

Thus, Acord's first argument fails.\r\n\n     Acord  next  argues  that  the  federal  regime  employs\r\n\ndifferent substantive standards  than the  Maine regime,  and\r\n\npoints  to  a  tradition of  interpreting  the  Longshore Act\r\n\n\"liberally\" in favor of claimants.

But  this  is  so  only where  the  difference\r\n\nundermines the rationale of the doctrine.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\n     Here, in  the Maine  proceeding, Acord's  doctor, Donald\r\n\nKalvoda, as well  as another treating physician,  Mark Henry,\r\n\ntestified that Acord suffered from degenerative  arthritis in\r\n\nhis knee  which was  worsening with the  passage of  time and\r\n\ncould  have been  temporarily exacerbated  by  the June  1987\r\n\ninjury;  but both  doctors said  unequivocally  in the  state\r\n\nproceeding that the June 1987 incident had no lasting effect.\r\n\nThe state  agency  so found.   It  is hard  to  see why  this\r\n\nfactual finding should  be affected by whether  the pertinent\r\n\nstatute is broadly or narrowly construed.\r\n\n     Similarly,  we agree with  Acord that federal  and Maine\r\n\nlaw deal  somewhat differently with cases where  a later job-\r\n\nrelated injury aggravates  an earlier one.   Federal case law\r\n\nmay depart from Maine's approach by making the later employer\r\n\nor insurer  liable for  the cumulative  injury, Liberty  Mut.\r                                                                         \r\n\nIns.

But again,  this\r\n\ndifference has  no apparent  logical bearing  on the  factual\r\n\nquestion whether the June 1987 event caused permanent injury.\r\n\n     Our  own  research  suggests  that  the  most  pertinent\r\n\ndifference  between  federal  and  Maine law  may  lie  in  a\r\n\ndifferent area.   Maine case law may be  more grudging in its\r\n\nwillingness to  compensate  the aggravation  of  an  existing\r\n\ncondition where the aggravation appears to be  part of normal\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\nlife rather than  the result of some increased  risk peculiar\r\n\nto the job.2  If there were any indication that this attitude\r\n\nhad influenced  the Maine  agency  finding at  issue in  this\r\n\ncase, there might be reason  to hesitate in giving collateral\r\n\nestoppel effect to this finding.\r\n\n     But the expert medical evidence in the Maine proceedings\r\n\n(already  described)  pointed   directly  to  the  conclusion\r\n\nreached by  the Maine  agency: that  the  June 1987  incident\r\n\ncaused no permanent  injury.  There is no  hint whatever that\r\n\nthe Maine agency thought that a permanent injury had occurred\r\n\nin June  1987 but  should be disregarded  because it  was not\r\n\ncompensable  under  Maine  law.   Whether  the  Maine factual\r\n\nfinding  was right  or wrong,  the agency  was not  evidently\r\n\ninfluenced by any difference between federal and Maine law.\r\n\n     The Maine finding may have been wrong, even though amply\r\n\nsupported by the evidence offered  in that case.  The federal\r\n\nALJ reached  a  different conclusion  by  crediting  slightly\r\n\ndifferent deposition  testimony from Dr.  Kalvoda given after\r                                                                         \r\n\nthe Maine proceeding;  the ALJ also chose to  place weight on\r\n\nAcord's testimony  that he  had begun  to suffer  a different\r\n\nsort  of pain  after the  June  1987 incident.

Acord\r\n\nhas given  us no reason to doubt that he had that opportunity\r\n\nin the Maine proceeding.  And,  it is by no means clear  that\r\n\nthe Maine  result was  wrong: the issue,  as in  many medical\r\n\ncausation matters, was probably a close call.\r\n\n     At  oral argument,  Acord  offered yet  another argument\r\n\nagainst collateral estoppel in workers' compensation matters,\r\n\nsaying  that in  Maine  (as elsewhere)  a  change in  medical\r\n\ncondition often  allows the reopening  or renewal of  a prior\r\n\nclaim.  Admittedly, this practice (evidenced here by the 1992\r\n\nincrease in Acord's own award  to 50 percent) is a limitation\r\n\non  conventional res  judicata.   In a  civil tort  action, a\r                                          \r\n\ncourt will not normally reopen a final judgment because later\r\n\nevents show  that the  injury was worse  than supposed.

(MB) at 290-92.3  Even assuming that Acord preserved\r\n\nthis final argument, it does not avail.\r\n\n     Historical accident has  given employees like  Acord the\r\n\nbenefit  of two different  compensation regimes.   Apart from\r\n\nlimitations  on duplicative  recovery,  occasions exist  when\r\n\nsuccessive  claims under federal  and state law  are entirely\r\n\npermissible;  but  successive  claims  are still  subject  to\r\n\nvarious conventional  limitations, like  collateral estoppel.\r\n\nOverall,  collateral estoppel  may as  easily  be helpful  to\r\n\nclaimants  as to  employers or insurers,  and it  reduces the\r\n\nlitigation costs for everyone. \r\n\n     Acord's claim is  also probably barred by  the Longshore\r\n\nAct's  one-year statute of  limitations, 33 U.S.C.    913(a).\r\n\nThe incident giving rise to  the claim occurred in June 1987;\r\n\nthe federal  claim was filed  in March 1992.   The statute of\r\n\nlimitations  defense was  properly  raised and  it  obviously\r\n\nprecluded Acord's claim  unless the claim was rescued  by the\r\n\ntolling  provision contained  in 33  U.S.C.    913(d),  which\r\n\nreads as follows:\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     3In  this very  case  the Maine  commission's  appellate\r\ndivision affirmed  a commissioner's rejection of  a separate,\r\nlater  claim by  Acord  for benefits  deriving from  the 1987\r\ninjury,  explaining that  \"the petition  [is]  barred by  the\r\ndoctrine of  res judicata  because of  a prior  determination\r                                     \r\n[i.e.,  in February  1989]  that the  effects  of the  injury\r                 \r\nended.\"\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                         -13-\r\r\n\n          Where recovery is  denied to any person,  in a\r\n     suit  brought at  law or  in  admiralty to  recover\r\n     damages  in  respect  of injury  or  death,  on the\r\n     ground  that such person  was an employee  and that\r\n     the defendant was an employer within the meaning of\r\n     this  chapter and  that such  employer had  secured\r\n     compensation to  such employee under  this chapter,\r\n     the  [one-year] limitation of time prescribed . . .\r\n     shall   begin  to  run   only  from  the   date  of\r\n     termination of such suit.\r\n\n     The  wording of this provision strongly suggests that it\r\n\nhas nothing to do with Acord's situation.  It may be doubtful\r\n\nthat  the Maine compensation proceeding is properly described\r\n\nas \"a  [damage] suit  brought at law  or in  admiralty;\" but,\r\n\neven  assuming   otherwise,  \"recovery\"  in  that   suit  was\r\n\ncertainly not denied \"on the  ground\" that the claimant  \"was\r\n\nan employee and the defendant was an employer\" covered by the\r\n\nfederal statute.  There is thus a compelling \"plain language\"\r\n\nargument against Acord's reliance on section 913(d).\r\n\n     The evident  purpose of  section  913(d) reinforces  its\r\n\nlanguage.  Worker compensation statutes were an innovation by\r\n\nwhich employers obtained statutory immunity to tort liability\r\n\nin  exchange for liability  without fault.   Especially where\r\n\nthere  might be some doubt  whether the Longshore Act covered\r\n\nthe  employee--often a  close question--a  precautionary tort\r\n\nsuit  might be  filed;  the  tolling  provision  was  plainly\r\n\nintended  to  protect the  employee's  compensation claim  if\r\n\nstatutory  immunity  defeated  the precautionary  suit.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nAyers v. Parker, 15 F. Supp. 447, 451 (D. Md. 1936).  Nothing\r                           \r\n\nlike this happened in Acord's case.\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                         -14-\r\r\n\n     Congress  could  also  have provided  that  the  federal\r\n\nstatute   is   tolled  wherever   a  claimant   begins  state\r\n\ncompensation proceedings addressed to the same injury, but it\r\n\ndid  not.   It  is  not obvious  that  federal courts  should\r\n\nenlarge an express  tolling provision on policy  grounds, nor\r\n\nare the policy grounds very compelling: once the ground rules\r\n\nare  clear, it  is  easy  enough for  a  claimant to  file  a\r\n\nprecautionary  federal claim within  one year of  the injury,\r\n\neven if the claimant prefers first to pursue a state remedy.\r\n\n     This might seem  to be the end of the matter except that\r\n\nthe Fifth Circuit declared some years ago that section 913(d)\r\n\ndoes  toll  the  Longshore Act  limitations  period  in cases\r\n\nsimilar  to  Acord's.

(1989), and, in October 1987, was awarded 25 percent partial disability benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between 1983 and 1987, Acord experienced a half-dozen incidents of trauma to his knee wherein some provocation would cause the knee to give way;  one incident occurred in June 1987, when Acord stubbed his toe and then jammed his knee as he rose from his desk.  Acord underwent further knee surgery and returned to his desk job in November 1987, now working only four hours a day based on his doctor's advice.  Degenerative arthritis in his knee joints indicated that his condition would worsen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One year later, in November 1988, Bath's company physician told Acord that he was being let go.  The record is murky but it was apparently Acord's own opinion that the coming winter would aggravate his knee, and it was the doctor's view that there would be no suitable work available if Acord's physical restrictions increased.  Acord has since sought reemployment at Bath, without success.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Birmingham Fire Insurance Company (\"Birmingham\"), which provided Bath's insurance coverage at the time of the June 1987 injury, began to pay Acord total disability benefits when he was dismissed in November 1988.  But Birmingham also petitioned the Maine workers' compensation agency, asking it to declare that the insurer had no continuing liability for the June 1987 injury.  In February 1989, after an evidentiary proceeding, a Maine commissioner held that Birmingham had proven that the June 1987 incident did not permanently contribute to Acord's condition;  this decision was affirmed by the commission's appellate division in September 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In related proceedings, Acord asked the Maine agency to increase his previous and continuing 25 percent disability award based on the 1983 injury;  Acord urged that his condition had worsened since 1983.  After extensive proceedings, the Maine agency ruled in June 1992 that the original disability payment should be increased to 50 percent, representing increased disability since 1983, and that the payments should be made by Liberty Mutual Insurance Company.  Liberty Mutual had been Bath's insurer at the time of the June 1983 injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly before this new ruling, Acord in March 1992 filed for federal workers' compensation benefits under the Longshore Act.  It is not uncommon for employees connected to maritime affairs to be covered by both federal and state compensation statutes, and federal jurisdiction in this case has not been disputed.  In the federal proceeding, Acord took the position that his June 1987 injury entitled him to permanent total disability benefits because it left him unable to fill the material handler position that he had previously held.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Birmingham resisted Acord's federal claim on multiple grounds:  that the claim, filed almost five years after the incident, was barred by the federal one-year statute of limitations, 33 U.S.C. &#167; 913;  that collateral estoppel precluded Acord from claiming permanent injury based on the June 1987 incident;  and that the medical evidence failed to support such a claim of permanent injury based on that incident.  A federal administrative law judge took evidence on the federal claim, reserving judgment on the legal defenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1993, the federal ALJ issued a decision awarding permanent total disability benefits to Acord, and against Birmingham, from and after Acord's last day at work in November 1988.  The decision rejected the collateral estoppel and statute of limitations defenses, on grounds described below, and concluded on the merits that the June 1987 incident had caused a permanent further aggravation in Acord's knee condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Birmingham sought review by the Department of Labor's Benefits Review Board, 33 U.S.C. &#167; 921(b), but the Benefits Review Board took no action on the matter.  Because the matter had been pending before the Benefits Review Board for more than one year and the Benefits Review Board had taken no action on it, it became final for purposes of judicial review in September 1996.  Pub.L. 104-134, &#167; 101(d), 110 Stat. 1321-219 (1996).  Birmingham then sought review in this court.  See 33 U.S.C. &#167; 921(c).  Acord, needless to say, supports the ALJ's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with Birmingham that the federal ALJ should have given collateral estoppel effect to the Maine agency's determination, in its February 1989 decision, that the June 1987 injury \"had no lasting effect on Mr. Acord's condition.\"   The state agency finding, in turn, precludes Acord's present claim.  Only the first of these two propositions requires much discussion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Often, respect for a prior judgment is mandated by the full faith and credit clause, U.S. Const. art.  IV, &#167; 1, or its statutory counterpart, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1738.  A literal reader might doubt that either has much to do with the present case, because (among other reasons) the former constrains states, not federal entities, and the latter is directed explicitly to federal courts and says nothing about federal agencies.  But the policy arguments for similar treatment--especially avoidance of duplicative litigation--tend to be the same.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without dwelling overmuch on the rationale, the Supreme Court has instructed that \"federal courts must give the [state] agency's factfinding the same preclusive effect to which it would be entitled in the State's courts.\"  University of Tennessee v. Elliott, 478 U.S. 788, 799, 106 S.Ct. 3220, 3226, 92 L.Ed.2d 635 (1986).  Ordinarily, the state agency must have been acting in an adjudicative capacity, United States v. Utah Constr. &amp; Mining Co., 384 U.S. 394, 422, 86 S.Ct. 1545, 1560, 16 L.Ed.2d 642 (1966), but that condition is satisfied in this case.  And Maine does treat such agency findings as a proper basis for precluding relitigation.  Van Houten v. Harco Constr., Inc., 655 A.2d 331, 333-34 (Me.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, one could say that a federal court must respect state agency factfinding but a federal agency need not.  Yet Elliott itself relied heavily upon Thomas v. Washington Gas Light Co., 448 U.S. 261, 281, 100 S.Ct. 2647, 2660-61, 65 L.Ed.2d 757 (1980), where the Supreme Court said that an agency finding in one state could bind another state's agency under the full faith and credit clause.  Elliott, 478 U.S. at 798-99, 106 S.Ct. at 3226.   And several circuit decisions have held that a federal agency is normally bound to respect findings by another agency acting within its competence.  West Helena Sav. &amp; Loan Assoc. v. Federal Home Loan Bank Bd., 553 F.2d 1175, 1180-81 (8th Cir.1977);  Safir v. Gibson, 432 F.2d 137, 143-44 (2d Cir.)  (Friendly, J.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 850, 91 S.Ct. 57, 27 L.Ed.2d 88 (1970).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the tendency is plainly in favor of applying collateral estoppel in administrative contexts, the subject is a complex one, with many variations;  and it is perhaps well not to generalize too broadly.  See 18 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 4475, at 762-63 &amp; n.3 (1981).  Here, no conflict exists between the tendency of the courts and the position of the agency involved, because the Benefits Review Board itself has declared that collateral estoppel effect is to be given under the Longshore Act to appropriate findings of \"other state or federal administrative tribunals.\"   Barlow v. Western Asbestos Co., 20 B.R.B.S.  (MB) 179, 180 (1988);  see also Vodanovich v. Fishing Vessel Owners Marine Ways, Inc., 27 B.R.B.S.  (MB) 286, 290-92 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the refusal of the federal ALJ to respect the Maine finding appears to have been based on a misunderstanding of Supreme Court case law on another subject.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  However, Acord seeks to defend the result on narrower and more conventional grounds.  He argues that differences in burdens of proof, and in the substantive standards, under the Maine and federal compensation schemes make collateral estoppel inappropriate.  These are legitimate arguments, but they ultimately do not succeed in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is quite true that collateral estoppel effect may be denied because of differences in burden of proof (for example, where the victor in the first case has a greater burden in the second).  Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co. v. Director, OWCP, 583 F.2d 1273, 1278-79 (4th Cir.1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 915, 99 S.Ct. 1232, 59 L.Ed.2d 465 (1979).  Here, Birmingham, by seeking a judgment from Maine limiting its liability, undertook the burden of proving, by a preponderance of evidence, that the June 1987 incident had no permanent effect.  See Nichols v. Viner Bros., Inc., 573 A.2d 789, 790 (Me.1990).  The Maine agency concluded that this burden had been carried.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the federal agency proceeding, Birmingham bore no heavier burden;  if anything, it had a lighter one.  Acord himself had the burden of proving permanent injury from the June 1987 incident, although he was aided by a conditioned federal presumption that \"the claim comes within the provisions of this chapter.\"  33 U.S.C. &#167; 920(a).  This presumption merely requires an employer to provide \"substantial evidence\" that the accident did not cause the harm, and then the presumption vanishes.  Brown v. I.T.T./Continental Baking Co. &amp; Ins. Co., 921 F.2d 289, 295 (D.C.Cir.1990);  Sprague v. Director, OWCP, 688 F.2d 862, 865-66 (1st Cir.1982).  Thus, Acord's first argument fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Acord next argues that the federal regime employs different substantive standards than the Maine regime, and points to a tradition of interpreting the Longshore Act \"liberally\" in favor of claimants.  Voris v. Eikel, 346 U.S. 328, 333, 74 S.Ct. 88, 92, 98 L.Ed. 5 (1953).  Certainly a difference in the legal standards pertaining to two proceedings may defeat the use of collateral estoppel.  See Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#167; 28(3), (4) (1982);  cf.  Long Island College Hosp. v. NLRB, 566 F.2d 833, 842, 844-45 (2d Cir.1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 996, 98 S.Ct. 1647, 56 L.Ed.2d 84 (1978).  But this is so only where the difference undermines the rationale of the doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, in the Maine proceeding, Acord's doctor, Donald Kalvoda, as well as another treating physician, Mark Henry, testified that Acord suffered from degenerative arthritis in his knee which was worsening with the passage of time and could have been temporarily exacerbated by the June 1987 injury;  but both doctors said unequivocally in the state proceeding that the June 1987 incident had no lasting effect.  The state agency so found.  It is hard to see why this factual finding should be affected by whether the pertinent statute is broadly or narrowly construed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, we agree with Acord that federal and Maine law deal somewhat differently with cases where a later job-related injury aggravates an earlier one.  Federal case law may depart from Maine's approach by making the later employer or insurer liable for the cumulative injury, Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 978 F.2d 750, 756 (1st Cir.1992), and mitigating this liability through a complex statutory regime.  33 U.S.C. &#167; 908(f).  But again, this difference has no apparent logical bearing on the factual question whether the June 1987 event caused permanent injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our own research suggests that the most pertinent difference between federal and Maine law may lie in a different area.  Maine case law may be more grudging in its willingness to compensate the aggravation of an existing condition where the aggravation appears to be part of normal life rather than the result of some increased risk peculiar to the job.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  If there were any indication that this attitude had influenced the Maine agency finding at issue in this case, there might be reason to hesitate in giving collateral estoppel effect to this finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the expert medical evidence in the Maine proceedings (already described) pointed directly to the conclusion reached by the Maine agency:  that the June 1987 incident caused no permanent injury.  There is no hint whatever that the Maine agency thought that a permanent injury had occurred in June 1987 but should be disregarded because it was not compensable under Maine law.  Whether the Maine factual finding was right or wrong, the agency was not evidently influenced by any difference between federal and Maine law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Maine finding may have been wrong, even though amply supported by the evidence offered in that case.  The federal ALJ reached a different conclusion by crediting slightly different deposition testimony from Dr. Kalvoda given after the Maine proceeding;  the ALJ also chose to place weight on Acord's testimony that he had begun to suffer a different sort of pain after the June 1987 incident.  If the ALJ decision were before us on the merits, it would probably be sustained, given the deference due to the factfinder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the point of collateral estoppel is that the first determination is binding not because it is right but because it is first--and was reached after a full and fair opportunity between the parties to litigate the issue.  Acord has given us no reason to doubt that he had that opportunity in the Maine proceeding.  And, it is by no means clear that the Maine result was wrong:  the issue, as in many medical causation matters, was probably a close call.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument, Acord offered yet another argument against collateral estoppel in workers' compensation matters, saying that in Maine (as elsewhere) a change in medical condition often allows the reopening or renewal of a prior claim.  Admittedly, this practice (evidenced here by the 1992 increase in Acord's own award to 50 percent) is a limitation on conventional res judicata.   In a civil tort action, a court will not normally reopen a final judgment because later events show that the injury was worse than supposed.  Cf. Restatement, supra, &#167; 73(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But a willingness to modify an award based on later changes in medical condition is not the same as giving a party two chances to litigate the same historical fact (here, whether the June 1987 injury caused permanent damage).  Such findings of historical fact are given collateral estoppel effect by compensation commissions, including the Maine commission.  Van Houten, 655 A.2d at 334;  Vodanovich, 27 B.R.B.S.  (MB) at 290-92.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Even assuming that Acord preserved this final argument, it does not avail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Historical accident has given employees like Acord the benefit of two different compensation regimes.  Apart from limitations on duplicative recovery, occasions exist when successive claims under federal and state law are entirely permissible;  but successive claims are still subject to various conventional limitations, like collateral estoppel.  Overall, collateral estoppel may as easily be helpful to claimants as to employers or insurers, and it reduces the litigation costs for everyone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Acord's claim is also probably barred by the Longshore Act's one-year statute of limitations, 33 U.S.C. &#167; 913(a).  The incident giving rise to the claim occurred in June 1987;  the federal claim was filed in March 1992.  The statute of limitations defense was properly raised and it obviously precluded Acord's claim unless the claim was rescued by the tolling provision contained in 33 U.S.C. &#167; 913(d), which reads as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where recovery is denied to any person, in a suit brought at law or in admiralty to recover damages in respect of injury or death, on the ground that such person was an employee and that the defendant was an employer within the meaning of this chapter and that such employer had secured compensation to such employee under this chapter, the [one-year] limitation of time prescribed ... shall begin to run only from the date of termination of such suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The wording of this provision strongly suggests that it has nothing to do with Acord's situation.  It may be doubtful that the Maine compensation proceeding is properly described as \"a [damage] suit brought at law or in admiralty;\" but, even assuming otherwise, \"recovery\" in that suit was certainly not denied \"on the ground\" that the claimant \"was an employee and the defendant was an employer\" covered by the federal statute.  There is thus a compelling \"plain language\" argument against Acord's reliance on section 913(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evident purpose of section 913(d) reinforces its language.  Worker compensation statutes were an innovation by which employers obtained statutory immunity to tort liability in exchange for liability without fault.  Especially where there might be some doubt whether the Longshore Act covered the employee--often a close question--a precautionary tort suit might be filed;  the tolling provision was plainly intended to protect the employee's compensation claim if statutory immunity defeated the precautionary suit.  See Ayers v. Parker, 15 F.Supp. 447, 451 (D.Md.1936).  Nothing like this happened in Acord's case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress could also have provided that the federal statute is tolled wherever a claimant begins state compensation proceedings addressed to the same injury, but it did not.  It is not obvious that federal courts should enlarge an express tolling provision on policy grounds, nor are the policy grounds very compelling:  once the ground rules are clear, it is easy enough for a claimant to file a precautionary federal claim within one year of the injury, even if the claimant prefers first to pursue a state remedy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This might seem to be the end of the matter except that the Fifth Circuit declared some years ago that section 913(d) does toll the Longshore Act limitations period in cases similar to Acord's.  Ingalls Shipbuilding Div., Litton Systems, Inc. v. Hollinhead, 571 F.2d 272 (5th Cir.1978).  The court's reasoning relies heavily on the general principle of liberal interpretation of the Longshore Act, id. at 274, which may seem a doubtful reason for ignoring express language.  Ingalls is also at odds with several well-reasoned district court cases,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and has not been adopted by any other circuit.  The Benefits Review Board apparently follows Ingalls in the Fifth Circuit, Calloway v. Zigler Shipyards, 16 B.R.B.S.  (MB) 175, 177 (1984), but that is only to be expected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, Ingalls is the only circuit precedent on the issue, and there might be a concern about fairness to claimants if we departed from Ingalls without warning.  Accordingly, we have thought it wiser to rest our decision here on collateral estoppel but to note as dictum our substantial doubts about Ingalls.   These doubts will not foreclose a future panel from deciding the Ingalls issue afresh, but their expression now should give ample notice to future claimants to protect their federal claims by filing within one year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eleventh Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The ALJ said that collateral estoppel could not apply because state workers' compensation schemes and the Longshore Act share concurrent jurisdiction.

He then sought and received a further award under the Longshore Act, 33 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 901 et seq.   On this appeal, we hold that the federal award was barred by collateral estoppel, and, for the benefit of future litigants, we address briefly the alternative statute of limitations defense advanced by the petitioner insurer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The events and procedural history are complicated, but a condensed version will set the scene.  Acord began work as a test electrician at Bath in 1974.  In 1982 he suffered upper-body injuries and in 1983, a knee injury and knee surgery;  and in 1984 he was transferred to a desk job.  He sought disability benefits under the Maine Workers' Compensation Act, 39 Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 1 et seq.  (1989), and, in October 1987, was awarded 25 percent partial disability benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between 1983 and 1987, Acord experienced a half-dozen incidents of trauma to his knee wherein some provocation would cause the knee to give way;  one incident occurred in June 1987, when Acord stubbed his toe and then jammed his knee as he rose from his desk.  Acord underwent further knee surgery and returned to his desk job in November 1987, now working only four hours a day based on his doctor's advice.  Degenerative arthritis in his knee joints indicated that his condition would worsen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One year later, in November 1988, Bath's company physician told Acord that he was being let go.  The record is murky but it was apparently Acord's own opinion that the coming winter would aggravate his knee, and it was the doctor's view that there would be no suitable work available if Acord's physical restrictions increased.  Acord has since sought reemployment at Bath, without success.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Birmingham Fire Insurance Company (\"Birmingham\"), which provided Bath's insurance coverage at the time of the June 1987 injury, began to pay Acord total disability benefits when he was dismissed in November 1988.  But Birmingham also petitioned the Maine workers' compensation agency, asking it to declare that the insurer had no continuing liability for the June 1987 injury.  In February 1989, after an evidentiary proceeding, a Maine commissioner held that Birmingham had proven that the June 1987 incident did not permanently contribute to Acord's condition;  this decision was affirmed by the commission's appellate division in September 1990.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In related proceedings, Acord asked the Maine agency to increase his previous and continuing 25 percent disability award based on the 1983 injury;  Acord urged that his condition had worsened since 1983.  After extensive proceedings, the Maine agency ruled in June 1992 that the original disability payment should be increased to 50 percent, representing increased disability since 1983, and that the payments should be made by Liberty Mutual Insurance Company.  Liberty Mutual had been Bath's insurer at the time of the June 1983 injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly before this new ruling, Acord in March 1992 filed for federal workers' compensation benefits under the Longshore Act.  It is not uncommon for employees connected to maritime affairs to be covered by both federal and state compensation statutes, and federal jurisdiction in this case has not been disputed.  In the federal proceeding, Acord took the position that his June 1987 injury entitled him to permanent total disability benefits because it left him unable to fill the material handler position that he had previously held.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Birmingham resisted Acord's federal claim on multiple grounds:  that the claim, filed almost five years after the incident, was barred by the federal one-year statute of limitations, 33 U.S.C. &#167; 913;  that collateral estoppel precluded Acord from claiming permanent injury based on the June 1987 incident;  and that the medical evidence failed to support such a claim of permanent injury based on that incident.  A federal administrative law judge took evidence on the federal claim, reserving judgment on the legal defenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1993, the federal ALJ issued a decision awarding permanent total disability benefits to Acord, and against Birmingham, from and after Acord's last day at work in November 1988.  The decision rejected the collateral estoppel and statute of limitations defenses, on grounds described below, and concluded on the merits that the June 1987 incident had caused a permanent further aggravation in Acord's knee condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Birmingham sought review by the Department of Labor's Benefits Review Board, 33 U.S.C. &#167; 921(b), but the Benefits Review Board took no action on the matter.  Because the matter had been pending before the Benefits Review Board for more than one year and the Benefits Review Board had taken no action on it, it became final for purposes of judicial review in September 1996.  Pub.L. 104-134, &#167; 101(d), 110 Stat. 1321-219 (1996).  Birmingham then sought review in this court.  See 33 U.S.C. &#167; 921(c).  Acord, needless to say, supports the ALJ's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with Birmingham that the federal ALJ should have given collateral estoppel effect to the Maine agency's determination, in its February 1989 decision, that the June 1987 injury \"had no lasting effect on Mr. Acord's condition.\"   The state agency finding, in turn, precludes Acord's present claim.  Only the first of these two propositions requires much discussion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Often, respect for a prior judgment is mandated by the full faith and credit clause, U.S. Const. art.

A literal reader might doubt that either has much to do with the present case, because (among other reasons) the former constrains states, not federal entities, and the latter is directed explicitly to federal courts and says nothing about federal agencies.  But the policy arguments for similar treatment--especially avoidance of duplicative litigation--tend to be the same.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without dwelling overmuch on the rationale, the Supreme Court has instructed that \"federal courts must give the [state] agency's factfinding the same preclusive effect to which it would be entitled in the State's courts.\"  University of Tennessee v.

See 18 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 4475, at 762-63 &amp; n.3 (1981).  Here, no conflict exists between the tendency of the courts and the position of the agency involved, because the Benefits Review Board itself has declared that collateral estoppel effect is to be given under the Longshore Act to appropriate findings of \"other state or federal administrative tribunals.\"   Barlow v. Western Asbestos Co., 20 B.R.B.S.  (MB) 179, 180 (1988);  see also Vodanovich v. Fishing Vessel Owners Marine Ways, Inc., 27 B.R.B.S.

He argues that differences in burdens of proof, and in the substantive standards, under the Maine and federal compensation schemes make collateral estoppel inappropriate.  These are legitimate arguments, but they ultimately do not succeed in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is quite true that collateral estoppel effect may be denied because of differences in burden of proof (for example, where the victor in the first case has a greater burden in the second).

Here, Birmingham, by seeking a judgment from Maine limiting its liability, undertook the burden of proving, by a preponderance of evidence, that the June 1987 incident had no permanent effect.

Acord himself had the burden of proving permanent injury from the June 1987 incident, although he was aided by a conditioned federal presumption that \"the claim comes within the provisions of this chapter.\"  33 U.S.C. &#167; 920(a).  This presumption merely requires an employer to provide \"substantial evidence\" that the accident did not cause the harm, and then the presumption vanishes.  Brown v.

See Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#167; 28(3), (4) (1982);  cf.  Long Island College Hosp. v.

But this is so only where the difference undermines the rationale of the doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, in the Maine proceeding, Acord's doctor, Donald Kalvoda, as well as another treating physician, Mark Henry, testified that Acord suffered from degenerative arthritis in his knee which was worsening with the passage of time and could have been temporarily exacerbated by the June 1987 injury;  but both doctors said unequivocally in the state proceeding that the June 1987 incident had no lasting effect.  The state agency so found.  It is hard to see why this factual finding should be affected by whether the pertinent statute is broadly or narrowly construed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, we agree with Acord that federal and Maine law deal somewhat differently with cases where a later job-related injury aggravates an earlier one.  Federal case law may depart from Maine's approach by making the later employer or insurer liable for the cumulative injury, Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593905\"><a href=\"/opinion/593905/liberty-mutual-insurance-company-v-commercial-union-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">978</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">750</span></a></span>, 756 (1st Cir.1992), and mitigating this liability through a complex statutory regime.  33 U.S.C. &#167; 908(f).  But again, this difference has no apparent logical bearing on the factual question whether the June 1987 event caused permanent injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our own research suggests that the most pertinent difference between federal and Maine law may lie in a different area.  Maine case law may be more grudging in its willingness to compensate the aggravation of an existing condition where the aggravation appears to be part of normal life rather than the result of some increased risk peculiar to the job.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  If there were any indication that this attitude had influenced the Maine agency finding at issue in this case, there might be reason to hesitate in giving collateral estoppel effect to this finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the expert medical evidence in the Maine proceedings (already described) pointed directly to the conclusion reached by the Maine agency:  that the June 1987 incident caused no permanent injury.  There is no hint whatever that the Maine agency thought that a permanent injury had occurred in June 1987 but should be disregarded because it was not compensable under Maine law.  Whether the Maine factual finding was right or wrong, the agency was not evidently influenced by any difference between federal and Maine law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Maine finding may have been wrong, even though amply supported by the evidence offered in that case.  The federal ALJ reached a different conclusion by crediting slightly different deposition testimony from Dr. Kalvoda given after the Maine proceeding;  the ALJ also chose to place weight on Acord's testimony that he had begun to suffer a different sort of pain after the June 1987 incident.  If the ALJ decision were before us on the merits, it would probably be sustained, given the deference due to the factfinder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the point of collateral estoppel is that the first determination is binding not because it is right but because it is first--and was reached after a full and fair opportunity between the parties to litigate the issue.  Acord has given us no reason to doubt that he had that opportunity in the Maine proceeding.  And, it is by no means clear that the Maine result was wrong:  the issue, as in many medical causation matters, was probably a close call.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument, Acord offered yet another argument against collateral estoppel in workers' compensation matters, saying that in Maine (as elsewhere) a change in medical condition often allows the reopening or renewal of a prior claim.  Admittedly, this practice (evidenced here by the 1992 increase in Acord's own award to 50 percent) is a limitation on conventional res judicata.   In a civil tort action, a court will not normally reopen a final judgment because later events show that the injury was worse than supposed.  Cf. Restatement, supra, &#167; 73(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But a willingness to modify an award based on later changes in medical condition is not the same as giving a party two chances to litigate the same historical fact (here, whether the June 1987 injury caused permanent damage).  Such findings of historical fact are given collateral estoppel effect by compensation commissions, including the Maine commission.  Van Houten, 655 A.2d at 334;  Vodanovich, 27 B.R.B.S.  (MB) at 290-92.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Even assuming that Acord preserved this final argument, it does not avail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Historical accident has given employees like Acord the benefit of two different compensation regimes.  Apart from limitations on duplicative recovery, occasions exist when successive claims under federal and state law are entirely permissible;  but successive claims are still subject to various conventional limitations, like collateral estoppel.  Overall, collateral estoppel may as easily be helpful to claimants as to employers or insurers, and it reduces the litigation costs for everyone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Acord's claim is also probably barred by the Longshore Act's one-year statute of limitations, 33 U.S.C. &#167; 913(a).  The incident giving rise to the claim occurred in June 1987;  the federal claim was filed in March 1992.  The statute of limitations defense was properly raised and it obviously precluded Acord's claim unless the claim was rescued by the tolling provision contained in 33 U.S.C. &#167; 913(d), which reads as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where recovery is denied to any person, in a suit brought at law or in admiralty to recover damages in respect of injury or death, on the ground that such person was an employee and that the defendant was an employer within the meaning of this chapter and that such employer had secured compensation to such employee under this chapter, the [one-year] limitation of time prescribed ... shall begin to run only from the date of termination of such suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The wording of this provision strongly suggests that it has nothing to do with Acord's situation.  It may be doubtful that the Maine compensation proceeding is properly described as \"a [damage] suit brought at law or in admiralty;\" but, even assuming otherwise, \"recovery\" in that suit was certainly not denied \"on the ground\" that the claimant \"was an employee and the defendant was an employer\" covered by the federal statute.  There is thus a compelling \"plain language\" argument against Acord's reliance on section 913(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evident purpose of section 913(d) reinforces its language.  Worker compensation statutes were an innovation by which employers obtained statutory immunity to tort liability in exchange for liability without fault.  Especially where there might be some doubt whether the Longshore Act covered the employee--often a close question--a precautionary tort suit might be filed;  the tolling provision was plainly intended to protect the employee's compensation claim if statutory immunity defeated the precautionary suit.  See Ayers v. Parker, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2127484\"><a href=\"/opinion/2127484/ayers-v-parker/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">447</span></a></span>, 451 (D.Md.1936).  Nothing like this happened in Acord's case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress could also have provided that the federal statute is tolled wherever a claimant begins state compensation proceedings addressed to the same injury, but it did not.  It is not obvious that federal courts should enlarge an express tolling provision on policy grounds, nor are the policy grounds very compelling:  once the ground rules are clear, it is easy enough for a claimant to file a precautionary federal claim within one year of the injury, even if the claimant prefers first to pursue a state remedy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This might seem to be the end of the matter except that the Fifth Circuit declared some years ago that section 913(d) does toll the Longshore Act limitations period in cases similar to Acord's.  Ingalls Shipbuilding Div., Litton Systems, Inc. v. Hollinhead, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"353294\"><a href=\"/opinion/353294/ingalls-shipbuilding-division-litton-systems-inc-v-roy-hollinhead-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">571</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></a></span> (5th Cir.1978).  The court's reasoning relies heavily on the general principle of liberal interpretation of the Longshore Act, id. at 274, which may seem a doubtful reason for ignoring express language.  Ingalls is also at odds with several well-reasoned district court cases,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and has not been adopted by any other circuit.  The Benefits Review Board apparently follows Ingalls in the Fifth Circuit, Calloway v. Zigler Shipyards, 16 B.R.B.S.  (MB) 175, 177 (1984), but that is only to be expected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, Ingalls is the only circuit precedent on the issue, and there might be a concern about fairness to claimants if we departed from Ingalls without warning.  Accordingly, we have thought it wiser to rest our decision here on collateral estoppel but to note as dictum our substantial doubts about Ingalls.   These doubts will not foreclose a future panel from deciding the Ingalls issue afresh, but their expression now should give ample notice to future claimants to protect their federal claims by filing within one year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eleventh Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The ALJ said that collateral estoppel could not apply because state workers' compensation schemes and the Longshore Act share concurrent jurisdiction.
