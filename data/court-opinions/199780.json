McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n               Torruella and Selya, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     James S. Hewes, by appointment of the court, on brief for\nappellant.\n     Gretchen Leah Witt, United States Attorney, Peter E. Papps, First\nAssistant United States Attorney, Jean B. Weld, Assistant United States\nAttorney, and Terry L. Ollila, Assistant United States Attorney, on\nbrief for the United States.\n\n\n\n\n                          January 15, 2002\n\f\f          Per Curiam. Appellant Felix Reynoso seeks reversal of his\n\nSeptember 7, 2000, criminal conviction on three counts of distributing\n\nand one count of conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine. 21 U.S.C. §§\n\n841(a)(1), 846. Reynoso makes two arguments: that the presence of an\n\nalternate juror tainted the jury's deliberations and that the evidence\n\nat trial was insufficient to support the verdict.\n\n          The jury that heard Reynoso's case consisted of twelve jurors\n\nand two alternates. The alternates were dismissed after the jury was\n\ncharged, but one of them stayed with the jury during its deliberations,\n\ncontrary to the court's instructions. When the alternate's presence\n\nwas brought to the court's attention, the district judge interviewed\n\nall twelve jurors and determined that the alternate had taken no part\n\nin the deliberations. He nevertheless offered to grant Reynoso a\n\nmistrial, but Reynoso declined after consulting with his lawyer. The\n\njury later convicted Reynoso on all four counts.\n\n          Whether or not the presence of the alternate during\n\ndeliberations was a violation of the current Fed. R. Crim. P. 24(c),\n\nwhich was amended in 1999 to permit alternates to be retained in\n\ncertain circumstances, it creates no grounds for reversal. Arguably,\n\nReynoso's decision to forego a mistrial constitutes waiver of any claim\n\nof error. See United States v. Mitchell, 85 F.3d 800, 807 (1st Cir.\n\n1996). However, there is some authority under the old version of the\n\nrule suggesting that--in order to preserve the integrity of the jury\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fsystem--errors of this kind should not be excused by agreement of the\n\nparties.    See United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 737 (1993)\n\n(assuming the point arguendo); id. at 741-43 (Kennedy, J., concurring)\n\n(noting \"good reasons\" for nonwaivability); see also United States v.\n\nAllison, 481 F.2d 468, 472 (5th Cir. 1973); 2 Wright, Federal Practice\n\n& Procedure § 388, at 52 (1969).\n\n            Whether or not the claim is deemed waived, it was certainly\n\nforfeited by Reynoso's failure to object and is reviewable only for\n\nplain error--requiring far more than just that the error be clear.\n\nAmong other requirements, Reynoso must show that the alternate's\n\npresence created actual prejudice.       See Olano, 507 U.S. at 734-35\n\n(citing Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b)). But after due investigation the\n\ndistrict court supportably found that the alternate had not affected\n\nthe deliberations, and Reynoso offers no evidence or arguments to the\n\ncontrary.\n\n            Reynoso's sufficiency claim is also forfeit because he failed\n\nto renew his Rule 29 motion after the presentation of his defense.\n\nUnited States v. Stein, 233 F.3d 6, 20 (1st Cir. 2000). The evidence\n\nimplicating Reynoso included testimony of an undercover police officer\n\nwho bought crack from Reynoso on three occasions, and of two co-\n\nconspirators who helped Reynoso sell crack.         This was more than\n\nsufficient to support the verdict; there was thus no error at all, let\n\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\falone the gross injustice needed to avoid the forfeiture. See id. at\n\n21.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f",
