In this appeal from a conviction for conspiring\r                         \r\n\nto possess with intent to  distribute cocaine base and possession\r\n\nwith intent to distribute, we  have both a brief from counsel  on\r\n\nappeal  and a  pro se  brief from appellant.   We  have carefully\r\n\nconsidered them,  as well  as the  record, and  deem this  a case\r\n\nwhere, regardless of the strength of defendant's arguments below,\r\n\nthere  remain  no issues  worthy  of  extensive consideration  on\r\n\nappeal.   We accordingly, without rehearsing the facts, which are\r\n\nwell  known  to the  parties, proceed  briefly  to deal  with the\r\n\narguments of appellant and his counsel.\r\n\n     The first challenge  is to the sufficiency  of the evidence.\r\n\nThe government, inexplicably, asserts in its brief (p.  18) that,\r\n\nafter the government  finally rested, the  defense did not  renew\r\n\nits  motion for judgment of acquittal.  And appellant himself (p.\r\n\n13) has made  the same assertion.  But our  reading of the record\r\n\nindicates that, after the government rested, the court said:\r\n\n          I will  treat the defendant as  having renewed his\r\n     motion  at the close of  the entire case,  and the same\r\n     ruling applies,  that the motion for  acquittal on each\r\n     of  Counts One and Two are denied.  There is sufficient\r\n     evidence to go to the jury.\r\n\n(Transcript p. 449).   It also appears that after  this statement\r\n\nthere was  no  new  evidence  submitted.   The  only  evidentiary\r\n\ndiscussion concerned  the mechanics of redacting  a record, which\r\n\nwas to be done while the jury was being instructed.\r\n\n     Therefore, we review for  error, not \"plain error.\"   But we\r\n\nfind no error.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n     Pullum,  the major  prosecution witness,  was fair  game for\r\n\nimpeachment at  trial, but  the jury  having found  his testimony\r\n\ncredible,  it  satisfies the  sufficiency requirement  under both\r\n\ncounts.   Moreover,  Pullum's testimony  was corroborated  by two\r\n\nother witnesses,  and  the finding  of  a substantial  amount  of\r\n\ncocaine base and paraphernalia  used in drug packaging in  places\r\n\nand equipment associated with appellant.\r\n\n     A generalized  challenge was  made to interruptions  made by\r\n\nthe prosecution to defendant's closing argument.  But no specific\r\n\ninterruptions have been  identified by appellant.   Nor were  any\r\n\nobjections made.   And  from the  government's references  to the\r\n\ninterruptions in  its brief, we  see no  possible prejudice,  let\r\n\nalone plain error.\r\n\n     Another  issue, again to be judged on a \"plain error\" basis,\r\n\nis that the court  failed to give, in haec  verba, an instruction\r\n\nto treat an accomplice's testimony \"with great care and caution.\"\r\n\nBut instructions were given, spotlighting  the vulnerabilities of\r\n\nwitnesses Pullum and Motil.  There was no plain error. See United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Newton, 891 F.2d 944, 949-50 (1st Cir. 1989).\r                          \r\n\n     Two defects  were alleged  in the  sentencing process.   The\r\n\nfirst,  an alleged failure to discount the weight of cocaine base\r\n\npreviously  purchased, was  a matter  clearly within  the court's\r\n\ndiscretion.    It  committed  no clear  error  in  observing that\r\n\ndifferent sources  were involved and that the discount applied to\r\n\nthe  seized  drugs should  not  be extended  to  those previously\r\n\npurchased.   A variation of  this issue, in  which it was  argued\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nthat only the  seized drugs  should be considered,  made for  the\r\n\nfirst time on appeal, is not before us.  As for the argument that\r\n\nthe court improperly refused to assign a minor role to appellant,\r\n\nwe see no clear error.  This was  clearly a judgment call for the\r\n\ndistrict court, with sufficient supporting evidence.\r\n\n     The  final  issue,  made  by  appellant,  pro  se,  is  that\r\n\nappellant's counsel,  both below and on  appeal, gave ineffective\r\n\nassistance.   We do not ordinarily hear ineffective assistance of\r\n\ncounsel claims on  direct appeal  and have no  reason to  deviate\r\n\nfrom  this rule  here. None  of the  allegations relating  to the\r\n\ntrial  are  before  us,  for  lack  of  a  developed  record  and\r\n\n\"extraordinary  circumstances.\"   See  United  States   v.  Diaz-\r                                                                           \r\n\nMartinez, 71 F.3d 946, 953 (1st Cir. 1995). \r                  \r\n\n     As  for  appellant's  pro  se  challenge  to  his  counsel's\r\n\neffectiveness on appeal, we merely note that the only issue which\r\n\ncounsel  chose  not to  brief was  that  of the  effectiveness of\r\n\nassistance at trial,  which, as  we have just  explained, is  not\r\n\nproperly before us on direct appeal.\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                       \r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n",
