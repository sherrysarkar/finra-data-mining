In this  procedural motley,  a\r                    SELYA, Circuit  Judge.\r                                         \r\n\nband of  plaintiffs    the eponymous BIW  Deceived    locks horns\r\n\nwith Local S6 of the  Industrial Union of Marine and Shipbuilding\r\n\nWorkers (the Union) over issues pertaining to removal and remand.\r\n\nThe peculiarities  of this engagement  impel us to  adumbrate our\r\n\nnecessarily circuitous  decisional path.   After delineating  the\r\n\nrelevant facts  and procedural  history, we  address whether  the\r\n\nplaintiffs have waived  their right to appeal  either by inviting\r\n\nthe judgment or by failing to seek our intervention at an earlier\r\n\ndate.   Finding no default, we proceed to  the merits   a journey\r\n\nthat requires  us to touch  upon doctrinal aspects  of preemption\r\n\nunder  federal labor  law  and  to explore  a  question of  first\r\n\nimpression   concerning   the   exercise  of   federal   question\r\n\njurisdiction in the context of  the artful pleading doctrine.  At\r\n\njourney's  end,   we  conclude  that  the  plaintiffs'  complaint\r\n\npresents  a colorable federal  question and that,  therefore, the\r\n\ndistrict court did  not err when it refused to return the case to\r\n\na state venue.\r\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          Because this  action stumbled near  the starting  gate,\r\n\nthe record is  stunted and the  facts before us  are sparse.   We\r\n\npresent them as best they present themselves.\r\n\n          In  the fall  of 1995,  Bath Iron  Works (Bath  or BIW)\r\n\nhired  a  number  of electricians  and  pipefitters.   The  Union\r\n\nparticipated in  the job interviews  pursuant to the terms  of an\r\n\nexisting   collective  bargaining  agreement   (the  CBA).    The\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nplaintiffs allege  that during  these interviews  the Union  told\r\n\nthem that they  would \"be employed at least  until the expiration\r\n\nof the current  Union contract [August 1997]\" and \"probably until\r\n\nthe  end  of   the  decade;\"    that  Bath  \"had  more  work  for\r\n\nelectricians and pipefitters than it could handle;\" and that Bath\r\n\n\"was hiring fewer electricians and pipefitters than it needed, so\r\n\nthat  the employees would  be assured of  continuing employment.\"\r\n\nThe  plaintiffs  further   allege  that  they  relied   on  these\r\n\nblandishments, accepted offers of employment, and left other jobs\r\n\nto move to Maine and work for Bath.  But, the plaintiffs say, the\r\n\nUnion had led them down a primrose path; they were laid off early\r\n\nin 1996.\r\n\nII.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r          II.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\n          Angered by  this  fecklessness,  the  former  employees\r\n\njoined together  to form  \"BIW Deceived\" and  sue the Union  in a\r\n\nMaine  state   court.1    Their  complaint   alleged  negligence,\r\n\nfraudulent misrepresentation, fraud in the inducement, infliction\r\n\nof   emotional   distress,   loss   of  consortium,   intentional\r\n\nnondisclosure, and unjust enrichment.  The Union promptly removed\r\n\nthe action  to the federal  district court.  When  the plaintiffs\r\n\nsought remand on the ground  that their suit involved only state-\r\n\nlaw  claims,  the  Union  responded  by  asserting that  all  the\r\n\nplaintiffs'  claims were subject to preemption under the National\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Two of the plaintiffs are former employees' spouses.  Since\r\ntheir claims for  loss of consortium are derivative,  we refer to\r\nthe informal plaintiff class as if it were composed solely of ex-\r\nemployees.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nLabor Relations Act (NLRA), 29  U.S.C.   151 et seq.,  and/or the\r                                                              \r\n\nLabor Management Relations Act (LMRA), 29 U.S.C.   185 et seq.\r                                                                        \r\n\n          Judge Carter resolved the removal/remand dispute in the\r\n\nUnion's favor.  He denied  the plaintiffs' motion, asserting in a\r\n\ntwo-page  order that  \"the claims  for  relief set  forth in  the\r\n\nComplaint  are  all  derivative  from  and  dependent  for  their\r\n\nresolution  upon duties defined and imposed by federal law, which\r\n\nlaw occupies  the field and,  by mandate of Congress,  closes the\r\n\nfield to state regulation.\"\r\n\n          That order produced a strange reaction:  the plaintiffs\r\n\nmoved for entry of final judgment in the defendant's favor.  They\r\n\nreasoned  that, in  refusing to  remand, the  district  court had\r\n\n\"conclu[ded] that  federal law  preempts all  state claims,\"  and\r\n\nthat  this conclusion  \"le[ft] nothing  more to be  litigated\" in\r\n\nthat court.  Judge Carter denied this motion without elaboration.\r\n\n          Shortly  thereafter,  Magistrate Judge  Cohen  presided\r\n\nover  a status conference during which the plaintiffs represented\r\n\nthat they had \"no interest in [pressing] any federal-law  claims\"\r\n\nand  that they desired  the entry of  final judgment  in order to\r\n\n\"appeal the  [district court's]  preemption ruling.\"   The  Union\r\n\nagreed not to  oppose the entry  of judgment in  its favor.   The\r\n\nnext day, the plaintiffs moved for reconsideration  and for entry\r\n\nof final judgment, specifically \"abandon[ing] any and all federal\r\n\nclaims.\"  This time Judge Carter granted their motion and entered\r\n\nfinal judgment,  without prejudice  to the  plaintiffs' right  to\r\n\nseek review.  This appeal followed.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nIII.  APPELLATE JURISDICTION\r          III.  APPELLATE JURISDICTION\r\n\n          It is a federal court's obligation to assure  itself of\r\n\nthe existence  of subject  matter jurisdiction  even if no  party\r\n\npresses  the question.   See American  Policyholders Ins.  Co. v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nNyacol  Prods., Inc.,  989  F.2d  1256,  1258  (1st  Cir.  1993).\r                              \r\n\nConsequently, we consider  whether the odd procedural  posture of\r\n\nthis case undermines our appellate jurisdiction.\r\n\n          In several circuits  a party who consents  to the entry\r\n\nof judgment  forfeits any  right  to appeal  from that  judgment.\r\n\nSee, e.g., Tel-Phonic  Servs., Inc. v. TBS Int'l,  Inc., 975 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n1134, 1137 (5th Cir. 1992); Clapp v. Commissioner, 875 F.2d 1396,\r                                                           \r\n\n1398  (9th   Cir.  1989).     We  have  taken  a   slightly  more\r\n\nlatitudinarian  approach:   while  acknowledging that,  with  few\r\n\nexceptions, \"a party  to a consent judgment is  thereby deemed to\r\n\nwaive any objections  it has to matters  within the scope  of the\r\n\njudgment,\"  Coughlin v.  Regan, 768  F.2d  468, 469-70  (1st Cir.\r                                        \r\n\n1985),2 we nevertheless have suggested that \"it is possible for a\r\n\nparty to consent to  a judgment and still preserve [its] right to\r\n\nappeal\" a previous ruling on  a contested matter in the case,  as\r\n\nlong as  it \"reserve[s] that  right unequivocally.\"  Id.  at 470.\r                                                                  \r\n\nSuch a reservation occurred here.  The record makes manifest that\r\n\nthe plaintiffs  sought  the entry  of  final judgment  solely  to\r\n\nfacilitate an  appeal of the  district court's refusal  to remand\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2The  specific  exceptions mentioned  by the  Coughlin court\r                                                                     \r\ninvolve \"a  showing of  either lack of  actual consent,  fraud in\r\nobtaining consent,  lack  of federal  jurisdiction, or  mistake.\"\r\n768 F.2d at 470.\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nthe suit.  Their initial motion for entry of final judgment asked\r\n\nthe  court  to  enter  a  \"final  and  appealable judgment;\"  the\r\n\nmagistrate's report  of the  status conference  related that  the\r\n\nplaintiffs \"simply seek the entry  of final judgment so that they\r\n\nmay appeal the court's preemption ruling;\" and the renewed motion\r\n\nfor  entry of  final judgment  solicited  the entry  of a  \"final\r\n\njudgment,  without prejudice  to the  plaintiffs'  right to  seek\r\n\nappeal.\"\r\n\n          This evidence clearly shows the plaintiffs' unequivocal\r\n\nintention.   Under Coughlin, then,  we have discretion  to accept\r                                     \r\n\nthe appeal  insofar as  it relates to  a prior  (contested) order\r\n\nnotwithstanding the plaintiffs' later consent to the entry of the\r\n\nfinal judgment  itself.  See Coughlin, 768 F.2d  at 470.  In this\r                                               \r\n\ninstance, we  are inclined  to exercise  that  discretion in  the\r\n\nplaintiffs' favor.\r\n\n          Even  so, our appellate  jurisdiction is not  free from\r\n\ndoubt.    The  parties  treat  this appeal  as  if  Judge  Carter\r\n\ndismissed the  suit because  the  various causes  of action  were\r\n\npreempted, but  this is  an inaccurate  characterization of  what\r\n\nactually transpired.  There was no dismissal:  while Judge Carter\r\n\nexpressed  his belief that the plaintiffs' claims were preempted,\r\n\nthe  only ruling that he made  on a contested matter consisted of\r\n\ndenying the  plaintiffs' motion to  remand.  This ruling  did not\r\n\nrequire a finding of preemption;  it only required a finding that\r\n\nthe Union had  made a colorable showing of  federal jurisdiction.\r\n\nSee infra Part  V.  That the  judge's remarks swept  more broadly\r                   \r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\ndoes  not alter  the reality  of events.    It is  settled beyond\r\n\nperadventure that a  party can appeal only from  an adverse order\r\n\nor judgment, not from a judge's ruminations.  See Logue  v. Dore,\r                                                                          \r\n\n103 F.3d 1040,  1047 (1st Cir. 1997);  In re Admin.  Warrant, 585\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d  1152, 1153  (1st Cir.  1978).   The  plaintiffs could  have\r\n\nwaited until the Union filed  a dispositive motion (say, a motion\r\n\nto dismiss or for summary judgment), but they chose not to do so.\r\n\nThus, the district  court's order denying the  plaintiffs' motion\r\n\nto remand is  the only order that is  even potentially reviewable\r\n\nin this proceeding.\r\n\n          The district court entered that order on July  3, 1996,\r\n\nand  the plaintiffs  did not  file their  notice of  appeal until\r\n\nOctober 25, 1996.   In some circuits, a  disappointed suitor must\r\n\nappeal  the denial  of a  motion  to remand  within the  standard\r\n\nappeal period (here,  thirty days, see Fed. R.  App. P. 4(a)(1)),\r                                                \r\n\nor else forever hold  his peace.  See Marshall v.  Manville Sales\r                                                                           \r\n\nCorp., 6 F.3d 229,  231 (4th Cir.  1993) (noting that the  Fourth\r               \r\n\nCircuit will not  \"disturb a district  court's final judgment  on\r\n\nthe basis of a defective  removal when the plaintiff ha[s] failed\r\n\nto seek  an interlocutory appeal  of the order  denying remand\");\r\n\nNishimoto v. Federman-Bachrach  &amp; Assocs., 903 F.2d 709, 713 (9th\r                                                   \r\n\nCir.  1990)  (holding  that  an  objection  to  removal  \"is  not\r\n\npreserved unless an interlocutory appeal is filed challenging the\r\n\ndistrict  court's order  denying  remand\").    Other  circuits   \r\n\nincluding this one   generally consider orders refusing remand to\r\n\nbe  interlocutory orders,  and  thus  a  plaintiff  whose  remand\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nrequest has been rebuffed possesses no immediate right of appeal,\r\n\nbut retains the right to press his point by taking an end-of-case\r\n\nappeal after the entry of final judgment.  See Neal v. Brown, 980\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 747, 747 (D.C. Cir. 1992); Carriere v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n893  F.2d  98,  100  n.2   (5th  Cir.  1990);  Brough  v.  United\r                                                                           \r\n\nSteelworkers, 437 F.2d  748, 749 (1st  Cir. 1971).   Accordingly,\r                      \r\n\nthe  entry  of final  judgment in  this  case paved  the  way for\r\n\nappellate consideration of the order denying the motion to remand\r\n\nand BIW Deceived's timely appeal is properly before us.\r\n\nIV.  THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK\r          IV.  THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK\r\n\n          There are three  interlocking pieces to the  applicable\r\n\nlegal framework.  We trace their contours.\r\n\n                         A.  Preemption.\r                                   A.  Preemption.\r                                                 \r\n\n          In the labor-law  arena, preemption    the displacement\r\n\nof  state  law  by the  force  of  federal law     is  a familiar\r\n\nphenomenon.   Several different strains of preemption flourish in\r\n\nthis field,  each possessing  somewhat different  roots and  each\r\n\ncasting a uniquely  configured shadow.   Two of these  preemption\r\n\ntheories bear upon the instant case.\r\n\n                                1.\r                                          1.\r                                            \r\n\n          Section  301  of the  LMRA,  29 U.S.C.     185, confers\r\n\nfederal  jurisdiction over  \"[s]uits for  violation  of contracts\r\n\nbetween  an  employer  and   a  labor  organization  representing\r\n\nemployees in an industry affecting commerce.\"   From this austere\r\n\nbeginning, the Supreme Court determined that it had the authority\r\n\nto craft  a federal  common law that  would effect  section 301's\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nobjectives.

These  cautions  do not  shrink  the scope  of\r\n\nsection 301 preemption, but simply emphasize that, for a claim to\r\n\narise under federal  law, it must depend upon  the meaning of the\r\n\ncollective bargaining agreement.\r\n\n                                2.\r                                          2.\r                                            \r\n\n          Preemption also can occur by operation of the so-called\r\n\nduty  of  fair representation  (DFR).    A  union acting  in  its\r\n\nrepresentative  capacity owes this duty to  those on whose behalf\r\n\nit  acts.   See  Ford Motor  Co.  v.

Although  our  research has  not\r\n\nrevealed any  ready-made solution  to this  dilemma, we  conclude\r\n\nthat the  artful pleading  doctrine permits  a district  court to\r\n\nrecharacterize a putative state-law claim as a federal claim when\r\n\na review of the complaint,  taken in context, reveals a colorable\r\n\nfederal question within a field  in which state law is completely\r\n\npreempted.    We  summarize the  reasoning  that  undergirds this\r\n\nconclusion.\r\n\n          As  a matter  of  common  practice,  a  district  court\r\n\nconfronted with a question of subject matter jurisdiction reviews\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\na plaintiff's complaint not to judge the merits, but to determine\r\n\nwhether the court has the  authority to proceed.  When conducting\r\n\nthis inquiry, the  court only asks whether the  complaint, on its\r\n\nface, asserts a colorable federal claim.  See Aldinger v. Howard,\r                                                                          \r\n\n427 U.S. 1, 7  (1976) (\"[W]here federal jurisdiction is  properly\r\n\nbased on a colorable  federal claim, the  court has the right  to\r\n\ndecide all  the questions  in the case  . .  . .\")  (citation and\r\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted);  Northeast Erectors Assoc.  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nSecretary of Labor, 62 F.3d 37, 39 n.1 (1st Cir. 1995) (observing\r                            \r\n\nthat \"federal question jurisdiction exists once the plaintiff has\r\n\nalleged even a colorable federal claim\").  As colorability is the\r\n\nlitmus  test  for the  existence  vel  non  of  federal  question\r                                                    \r\n\njurisdiction,  we see  no reason  why  a court  should not  apply\r\n\nprecisely the same standard when called upon to determine whether\r\n\na complaint  demands recharacterization under the artful pleading\r\n\ndoctrine.   Indeed, because  the critical inquiry  when reviewing\r\n\nthe denial of a motion to remand is \"whether the federal district\r\n\ncourt would  have had  original jurisdiction of  the case  had it\r\n\nbeen filed in  that court,\" Grubbs, 405  U.S. at 702, the  use of\r                                            \r\n\nany other standard would be incongruous.4\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4Siler  v. Louisville  &amp; Nashville  R.R. Co.,  213 U.S.  175\r                                                           \r\n(1909), is not to the contrary.  Though the Siler Court stated in\r                                                           \r\ndictum that \"the Federal question must not be merely colorable or\r\nfraudulently set up  for the mere purpose of  endeavoring to give\r\nthe court jurisdiction,\"  id. at 191-92, the Court  used the word\r                                       \r\n\"colorable\" in a  different sense than we do  today.  \"Colorable\"\r\nhas two definitions:   it may mean \"seemingly  valid or genuine,\"\r\nor it may  mean \"intended to deceive.\"   Webster's New Collegiate\r                                                                           \r\nDictionary  220 (1981).  The  Siler Court unquestionably used the\r                                             \r\nword in the latter sense,  in a discussion about spurious claims.\r\nSee Siler, 213 U.S. at 191-92; compare Penn Mut. Life Ins. Co. v.\r                                                                        \r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\n          This  formulation  is   reinforced  by  the  principles\r\n\narticulated in Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc. v. Thompson, 478 U.S. 804\r                                                             \r\n\n(1986).  There,  the Supreme Court stressed  that \"determinations\r\n\nabout  federal  jurisdiction  require sensitive  judgments  about\r\n\ncongressional  intent, judicial power,  and the  federal system.\"\r\n\nId. at 810.   Employing  the colorability  standard soothes  such\r             \r\n\nsensitivities,  for  where there  is  complete preemption,  there\r\n\nnecessarily has  been a triad  of judicial determinations:   that\r\n\nCongress intended federal law to occupy the whole of a regulatory\r\n\nfield;  that federal judicial  power properly extends  to actions\r\n\noriginally filed  in state courts  to the extent that  they touch\r\n\nupon that field; and that the exercise of such federal power does\r\n\nnot  offend principles of  federalism.  See  Franchise Tax Board,\r                                                                          \r\n\n463 U.S. at 23.\r\n\nVI.  THE MERITS\r          VI.  THE MERITS\r\n\n          Having  fashioned the standard  by which we  must gauge\r\n\nthe propriety of removal and  remand, we conclude without serious\r\n\nquestion  that the instant complaint reveals a colorable question\r\n\nof federal  law and that,  therefore, the district court  did not\r\n\nerr when it denied the motion to remand.\r\n\n          We  start with the plaintiffs' negligence claim and its\r\n\nrelationship to section 301 of the LMRA.  This  claim can survive\r\n\nRawson-based preemption under section 301 only if the Union acted\r                \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nAustin, 168 U.S.  685, 695 (1898) (noting  appellate jurisdiction\r                \r\nwherever  there is  a  claim  that a  state  law contravenes  the\r\nConstitution, as  long as the  claim is \"real and  colorable, not\r\nfictitious and fraudulent\").   We use the word  in the \"seemingly\r\nvalid or genuine\" sense.\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\n\"in a way that might violate the duty of reasonable care  owed to\r\n\nevery person in  society.\"  Rawson, 495  U.S. at 371.   The claim\r                                            \r\n\nasserts  that,  during  the  recruitment  interviews,  the  Union\r\n\nbreached its duty of care to the interviewees.  At oral argument,\r\n\ncounsel for  BIW Deceived gave  this a gloss,  acknowledging that\r\n\nthe Union participated in  the interview process pursuant  to the\r\n\nCBA.  This being  so, it is plausible  (indeed, likely) that  the\r\n\nCBA details the nature and limits of the Union's participation in\r\n\nthe interview  process and that the Union,  therefore, would have\r\n\nhad a duty of care separate from any duty owed by  third parties.\r\n\nSo  viewed, the Union stands accused  of violating a duty of care\r\n\nthat flowed to it pursuant to the CBA, and the plaintiffs' state-\r\n\nlaw   negligence   claim,   when  recharacterized,   passes   the\r\n\ncolorability test.   It is thus arguably preempted.   See Rawson,\r                                                                          \r\n\n495 U.S. 371-72 (\"Pre-emption by federal law cannot be avoided by\r\n\ncharacterizing  the Union's negligent performance of what it does\r\n\non behalf of  the members of the bargaining  unit pursuant to the\r\n\nterms  of  the  collective-bargaining  contract  as  a  state-law\r\n\ntort.\").\r\n\n          Even were  we to assume  for argument's  sake that  the\r\n\nplaintiffs'  negligence  claim, so  recharacterized  in light  of\r\n\nsection 301, does  not raise a colorable federal  claim, we still\r\n\nwould be bound to affirm the district court's denial of remand on\r\n\nthe ground that the claim also is arguably preempted via the duty\r\n\nof fair  representation.  The  fact that the plaintiffs  were not\r\n\nmembers of the  Union at the time  the statements were  made does\r\n\n                                18\r\r\n\nnot command a contrary conclusion for a union owes a duty of fair\r\n\nrepresentation   to    nonmembers   whom   it    has   undertaken\r\n\nconstructively  to represent.  See,  e.g., Steele v. Louisville &amp;\r                                                                           \r\n\nNashville R.R. Co., 323 U.S. 192, 204 (1944); Nedd v. United Mine\r                                                                           \r\n\nWorkers, 556  F.2d 190, 200  (3d Cir. 1977);  Amalgamated Transit\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnion Div.  822, 305 N.L.R.B.  946, 949-50 (1991).   Here, taking\r                         \r\n\nthe facts as limned by the plaintiffs, the Union plainly acted in\r\n\na  representational  capacity  during  the  recruitment  process.\r\n\nIndeed, the plaintiffs, in their complaint, speak of the \"special\r\n\nrelationship\" that existed between them  and the Union, and their\r\n\ntheory of the case seemingly hinges on their ability to establish\r\n\na  symbiotic relationship of advocacy  and dependence at the time\r\n\nof the  interviews.   Under these  circumstances, the  negligence\r\n\nclaim, when recharacterized,  sufficiently resembles a  DFR claim\r\n\nto pass  the colorability test  and thus support the  exercise of\r\n\nfederal question jurisdiction.\r\n\n          Let us be perfectly clear.  Because of the nearly empty\r\n\nrecord,  we cannot  say  with  certitude  whether we  would  find\r\n\nultimately that federal  preemption applies in the  instant case.\r\n\nAt  this stage of the  proceedings, however, we  need not go that\r\n\nfar; to uphold  the district court's exercise of federal question\r\n\njurisdiction, we need only conclude that, despite the plaintiffs'\r\n\nstate-law  stylings,  the  complaint  articulates  at  least  one\r\n\ncolorable   federal   claim.     Properly   recharacterized,  the\r\n\nplaintiffs' complaint falls into this category.\r\n\n          To  this  point, we  have  trained  our sights  on  the\r\n\n                                19\r\r\n\nnegligence claim.   While we believe that, for the most part, the\r\n\nother  claims contained  in the  plaintiffs' complaint  similarly\r\n\nstate claims that, when recharacterized, are colorably federal in\r\n\nnature, we need not probe the point too deeply.  A  federal court\r\n\nthat  exercises federal question jurisdiction over a single claim\r\n\nmay  also assert  supplemental  jurisdiction over  all  state-law\r\n\nclaims that arise from  the same nucleus of operative facts.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\n28 U.S.C.   1367(a); see  also International College of Surgeons,\r                                                                          \r\n\n66 U.S.L.W. at 4043-44; Roche v.

After delineating  the\r\n\nrelevant facts  and procedural  history, we  address whether  the\r\n\nplaintiffs have waived  their right to appeal  either by inviting\r\n\nthe judgment or by failing to seek our intervention at an earlier\r\n\ndate.   Finding no default, we proceed to  the merits   a journey\r\n\nthat requires  us to touch  upon doctrinal aspects  of preemption\r\n\nunder  federal labor  law  and  to explore  a  question of  first\r\n\nimpression   concerning   the   exercise  of   federal   question\r\n\njurisdiction in the context of  the artful pleading doctrine.  At\r\n\njourney's  end,   we  conclude  that  the  plaintiffs'  complaint\r\n\npresents  a colorable federal  question and that,  therefore, the\r\n\ndistrict court did  not err when it refused to return the case to\r\n\na state venue.\r\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          Because this  action stumbled near  the starting  gate,\r\n\nthe record is  stunted and the  facts before us  are sparse.   We\r\n\npresent them as best they present themselves.\r\n\n          In  the fall  of 1995,  Bath Iron  Works (Bath  or BIW)\r\n\nhired  a  number  of electricians  and  pipefitters.   The  Union\r\n\nparticipated in  the job interviews  pursuant to the terms  of an\r\n\nexisting   collective  bargaining  agreement   (the  CBA).    The\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nplaintiffs allege  that during  these interviews  the Union  told\r\n\nthem that they  would \"be employed at least  until the expiration\r\n\nof the current  Union contract [August 1997]\" and \"probably until\r\n\nthe  end  of   the  decade;\"    that  Bath  \"had  more  work  for\r\n\nelectricians and pipefitters than it could handle;\" and that Bath\r\n\n\"was hiring fewer electricians and pipefitters than it needed, so\r\n\nthat  the employees would  be assured of  continuing employment.\"\r\n\nThe  plaintiffs  further   allege  that  they  relied   on  these\r\n\nblandishments, accepted offers of employment, and left other jobs\r\n\nto move to Maine and work for Bath.  But, the plaintiffs say, the\r\n\nUnion had led them down a primrose path; they were laid off early\r\n\nin 1996.\r\n\nII.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r          II.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\n          Angered by  this  fecklessness,  the  former  employees\r\n\njoined together  to form  \"BIW Deceived\" and  sue the Union  in a\r\n\nMaine  state   court.1    Their  complaint   alleged  negligence,\r\n\nfraudulent misrepresentation, fraud in the inducement, infliction\r\n\nof   emotional   distress,   loss   of  consortium,   intentional\r\n\nnondisclosure, and unjust enrichment.  The Union promptly removed\r\n\nthe action  to the federal  district court.  When  the plaintiffs\r\n\nsought remand on the ground  that their suit involved only state-\r\n\nlaw  claims,  the  Union  responded  by  asserting that  all  the\r\n\nplaintiffs'  claims were subject to preemption under the National\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Two of the plaintiffs are former employees' spouses.  Since\r\ntheir claims for  loss of consortium are derivative,  we refer to\r\nthe informal plaintiff class as if it were composed solely of ex-\r\nemployees.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nLabor Relations Act (NLRA), 29  U.S.C.   151 et seq.,  and/or the\r                                                              \r\n\nLabor Management Relations Act (LMRA), 29 U.S.C.   185 et seq.\r                                                                        \r\n\n          Judge Carter resolved the removal/remand dispute in the\r\n\nUnion's favor.  He denied  the plaintiffs' motion, asserting in a\r\n\ntwo-page  order that  \"the claims  for  relief set  forth in  the\r\n\nComplaint  are  all  derivative  from  and  dependent  for  their\r\n\nresolution  upon duties defined and imposed by federal law, which\r\n\nlaw occupies  the field and,  by mandate of Congress,  closes the\r\n\nfield to state regulation.\"\r\n\n          That order produced a strange reaction:  the plaintiffs\r\n\nmoved for entry of final judgment in the defendant's favor.  They\r\n\nreasoned  that, in  refusing to  remand, the  district  court had\r\n\n\"conclu[ded] that  federal law  preempts all  state claims,\"  and\r\n\nthat  this conclusion  \"le[ft] nothing  more to be  litigated\" in\r\n\nthat court.  Judge Carter denied this motion without elaboration.\r\n\n          Shortly  thereafter,  Magistrate Judge  Cohen  presided\r\n\nover  a status conference during which the plaintiffs represented\r\n\nthat they had \"no interest in [pressing] any federal-law  claims\"\r\n\nand  that they desired  the entry of  final judgment  in order to\r\n\n\"appeal the  [district court's]  preemption ruling.\"   The  Union\r\n\nagreed not to  oppose the entry  of judgment in  its favor.   The\r\n\nnext day, the plaintiffs moved for reconsideration  and for entry\r\n\nof final judgment, specifically \"abandon[ing] any and all federal\r\n\nclaims.\"  This time Judge Carter granted their motion and entered\r\n\nfinal judgment,  without prejudice  to the  plaintiffs' right  to\r\n\nseek review.  This appeal followed.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nIII.  APPELLATE JURISDICTION\r          III.

Their initial motion for entry of final judgment asked\r\n\nthe  court  to  enter  a  \"final  and  appealable judgment;\"  the\r\n\nmagistrate's report  of the  status conference  related that  the\r\n\nplaintiffs \"simply seek the entry  of final judgment so that they\r\n\nmay appeal the court's preemption ruling;\" and the renewed motion\r\n\nfor  entry of  final judgment  solicited  the entry  of a  \"final\r\n\njudgment,  without prejudice  to the  plaintiffs'  right to  seek\r\n\nappeal.\"\r\n\n          This evidence clearly shows the plaintiffs' unequivocal\r\n\nintention.   Under Coughlin, then,  we have discretion  to accept\r                                     \r\n\nthe appeal  insofar as  it relates to  a prior  (contested) order\r\n\nnotwithstanding the plaintiffs' later consent to the entry of the\r\n\nfinal judgment  itself.  See Coughlin, 768 F.2d  at 470.  In this\r                                               \r\n\ninstance, we  are inclined  to exercise  that  discretion in  the\r\n\nplaintiffs' favor.\r\n\n          Even  so, our appellate  jurisdiction is not  free from\r\n\ndoubt.    The  parties  treat  this appeal  as  if  Judge  Carter\r\n\ndismissed the  suit because  the  various causes  of action  were\r\n\npreempted, but  this is  an inaccurate  characterization of  what\r\n\nactually transpired.  There was no dismissal:  while Judge Carter\r\n\nexpressed  his belief that the plaintiffs' claims were preempted,\r\n\nthe  only ruling that he made  on a contested matter consisted of\r\n\ndenying the  plaintiffs' motion to  remand.  This ruling  did not\r\n\nrequire a finding of preemption;  it only required a finding that\r\n\nthe Union had  made a colorable showing of  federal jurisdiction.\r\n\nSee infra Part  V.

THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK\r          IV.  THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK\r\n\n          There are three  interlocking pieces to the  applicable\r\n\nlegal framework.

Several different strains of preemption flourish in\r\n\nthis field,  each possessing  somewhat different  roots and  each\r\n\ncasting a uniquely  configured shadow.   Two of these  preemption\r\n\ntheories bear upon the instant case.\r\n\n                                1.\r                                          1.\r                                            \r\n\n          Section  301  of the  LMRA,  29 U.S.C.     185, confers\r\n\nfederal  jurisdiction over  \"[s]uits for  violation  of contracts\r\n\nbetween  an  employer  and   a  labor  organization  representing\r\n\nemployees in an industry affecting commerce.\"   From this austere\r\n\nbeginning, the Supreme Court determined that it had the authority\r\n\nto craft  a federal  common law that  would effect  section 301's\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nobjectives.

THE LITMUS TEST\r\n\n          The foregoing articulations of complete preemption, the\r\n\nstandard of review, and the artful pleading doctrine are helpful,\r\n\nbut they  do not  tell us  how certain a  court must  be that  an\r\n\nartfully  pleaded complaint  contains a  federal question  before\r\n\ndenying  a motion  to  remand.   Although  our  research has  not\r\n\nrevealed any  ready-made solution  to this  dilemma, we  conclude\r\n\nthat the  artful pleading  doctrine permits  a district  court to\r\n\nrecharacterize a putative state-law claim as a federal claim when\r\n\na review of the complaint,  taken in context, reveals a colorable\r\n\nfederal question within a field  in which state law is completely\r\n\npreempted.    We  summarize the  reasoning  that  undergirds this\r\n\nconclusion.\r\n\n          As  a matter  of  common  practice,  a  district  court\r\n\nconfronted with a question of subject matter jurisdiction reviews\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\na plaintiff's complaint not to judge the merits, but to determine\r\n\nwhether the court has the  authority to proceed.  When conducting\r\n\nthis inquiry, the  court only asks whether the  complaint, on its\r\n\nface, asserts a colorable federal claim.  See Aldinger v. Howard,\r                                                                          \r\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109503\"><a href=\"/opinion/109503/aldinger-v-howard/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7  (1976) (\"[W]here federal jurisdiction is  properly\r\n\nbased on a colorable  federal claim, the  court has the right  to\r\n\ndecide all  the questions  in the case  . .  . .\")  (citation and\r\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted);  Northeast Erectors Assoc.  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nSecretary of Labor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196246\"><a href=\"/opinion/196246/northeast-erectors-v-dol/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 39 n.1 (1st Cir. 1995) (observing\r                            \r\n\nthat \"federal question jurisdiction exists once the plaintiff has\r\n\nalleged even a colorable federal claim\").

Employing  the colorability  standard soothes  such\r             \r\n\nsensitivities,  for  where there  is  complete preemption,  there\r\n\nnecessarily has  been a triad  of judicial determinations:   that\r\n\nCongress intended federal law to occupy the whole of a regulatory\r\n\nfield;  that federal judicial  power properly extends  to actions\r\n\noriginally filed  in state courts  to the extent that  they touch\r\n\nupon that field; and that the exercise of such federal power does\r\n\nnot  offend principles of  federalism.

The claim\r                                            \r\n\nasserts  that,  during  the  recruitment  interviews,  the  Union\r\n\nbreached its duty of care to the interviewees.  At oral argument,\r\n\ncounsel for  BIW Deceived gave  this a gloss,  acknowledging that\r\n\nthe Union participated in  the interview process pursuant  to the\r\n\nCBA.  This being  so, it is plausible  (indeed, likely) that  the\r\n\nCBA details the nature and limits of the Union's participation in\r\n\nthe interview  process and that the Union,  therefore, would have\r\n\nhad a duty of care separate from any duty owed by  third parties.\r\n\nSo  viewed, the Union stands accused  of violating a duty of care\r\n\nthat flowed to it pursuant to the CBA, and the plaintiffs' state-\r\n\nlaw   negligence   claim,   when  recharacterized,   passes   the\r\n\ncolorability test.   It is thus arguably preempted.   See Rawson,\r                                                                          \r\n\n495 U.S. 371-72 (\"Pre-emption by federal law cannot be avoided by\r\n\ncharacterizing  the Union's negligent performance of what it does\r\n\non behalf of  the members of the bargaining  unit pursuant to the\r\n\nterms  of  the  collective-bargaining  contract  as  a  state-law\r\n\ntort.\").\r\n\n          Even were  we to assume  for argument's  sake that  the\r\n\nplaintiffs'  negligence  claim, so  recharacterized  in light  of\r\n\nsection 301, does  not raise a colorable federal  claim, we still\r\n\nwould be bound to affirm the district court's denial of remand on\r\n\nthe ground that the claim also is arguably preempted via the duty\r\n\nof fair  representation.

Here, taking\r                         \r\n\nthe facts as limned by the plaintiffs, the Union plainly acted in\r\n\na  representational  capacity  during  the  recruitment  process.\r\n\nIndeed, the plaintiffs, in their complaint, speak of the \"special\r\n\nrelationship\" that existed between them  and the Union, and their\r\n\ntheory of the case seemingly hinges on their ability to establish\r\n\na  symbiotic relationship of advocacy  and dependence at the time\r\n\nof the  interviews.   Under these  circumstances, the  negligence\r\n\nclaim, when recharacterized,  sufficiently resembles a  DFR claim\r\n\nto pass  the colorability test  and thus support the  exercise of\r\n\nfederal question jurisdiction.\r\n\n          Let us be perfectly clear.  Because of the nearly empty\r\n\nrecord,  we cannot  say  with  certitude  whether we  would  find\r\n\nultimately that federal  preemption applies in the  instant case.\r\n\nAt  this stage of the  proceedings, however, we  need not go that\r\n\nfar; to uphold  the district court's exercise of federal question\r\n\njurisdiction, we need only conclude that, despite the plaintiffs'\r\n\nstate-law  stylings,  the  complaint  articulates  at  least  one\r\n\ncolorable   federal   claim.     Properly   recharacterized,  the\r\n\nplaintiffs' complaint falls into this category.\r\n\n          To  this  point, we  have  trained  our sights  on  the\r\n\n                                19\r\r\n\nnegligence claim.   While we believe that, for the most part, the\r\n\nother  claims contained  in the  plaintiffs' complaint  similarly\r\n\nstate claims that, when recharacterized, are colorably federal in\r\n\nnature, we need not probe the point too deeply.  A  federal court\r\n\nthat  exercises federal question jurisdiction over a single claim\r\n\nmay  also assert  supplemental  jurisdiction over  all  state-law\r\n\nclaims that arise from  the same nucleus of operative facts.
