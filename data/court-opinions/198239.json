WALLACE AND JOAN M. WALLACE,\r\n\n                 Defendants, Appellees.\r\n\n      APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n           FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n    [Hon. Edward F. Harrington, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n           Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n              and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\r\n\nMatthew J. McGowan and Salter, McGowan, Swartz &amp; Sylvia on\r\nbrief for appellant.\r\n\nDecember 2, 1998\r\n\nPer Curiam.  Upon careful review of appellant's brief and the\r\nrecord, we conclude that the district court did not err in\r\ndismissing this appeal from a bankruptcy court order.  The appeal\r\nwas moot for the reasons stated in the district court's Memorandum\r\nand Order dated March 6, 1998. \r\nFurther, the appeal was not excused from the requirement of a\r\nlive case or controversy.  Although the bankruptcy court proceeding\r\nof which appellant complained may be \"capable of repetition,\" we\r\ncannot say that appellant's underlying issue will \"yet evade\r\nreview.\"  See Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. ICC, 219 U.S. 498,\r\n515 (1911).  Appellant may yet be able to litigate the issue in\r\nother cases, in particular ones where the bankruptcy court rejects\r\nthe reaffirmation agreement.  Other avenues may conceivably exist. \r\nCompare Whitehouse v. United States District Court, 53 F.3d 1349,\r\n1353 (1st Cir. 1995) (declaratory judgment action was the \"proper\r\nmethod\" to challenge a local rule); United States v. Arthur\r\nAndersen &amp; Co., 623 F.2d 720, 723 (1st Cir. 1980) (suggesting\r\ncontempt proceedings as a possible method to obtain appellate\r\nreview).\r\nAs an additional ground for dismissal, it appears that\r\nappellant lacks standing to appeal from the order at issue here. \r\nThe show cause order on its face was addressed to another party,\r\ndid not require any action of appellant, and did not threaten or\r\nimpose any sanction against appellant, and so the denial of\r\nappellant's motion to vacate that order had no practical effect on\r\nappellant.  Although appellant  has  complained of various  costs\r\n                           2\r\n\nincurred to prepare for and attend such show cause hearings and\r\nalso of a general \"chilling effect\" arising from the possibility of\r\nsuch hearings, it does not appear that the show cause order or the\r\ndenial of appellant's motion to vacate had any direct, adverse,\r\npecuniary effect on appellant, as required to vest appellant with\r\nstanding to appeal.  See In re El San Juan Hotel, 809 F.2d 151,\r\n154-56 (1st Cir. 1987).\r\nWe intend no comment on the merits, if any, of appellant's\r\nunderlying issue.\r\nAffirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
