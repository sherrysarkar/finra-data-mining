His employers\r\n\n-- Arthur Venios, Christy Venios, and Bel-Art Realty, Inc. (\"Bel-\r\n\nArt\") -- were indicted for the same offenses.\r\n\n          The   Venios'  and  Bel-Art  retained  attorney  Morris\r\n\nGoldings  to represent  them  at trial.   Bucuvalas  subsequently\r\n\nsought to retain  Goldings as  well.  Goldings  was not  willing,\r\n\nhowever, to represent  both Bucuvalas and his co-defendants.  He,\r\n\ntherefore,  referred  Bucuvalas  to Attorney  Terry  Segal,  whom\r\n\nBucuvalas  had retained  on  past occasions.   Segal  represented\r\n\nBucuvalas in a criminal tax investigation which did not result in\r\n\nan  indictment and  in a  trial for bribery  which resulted  in a\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nsplit   verdict.     Apparently  satisfied   with  Segal's   past\r\n\nrepresentation,  Bucuvalas  took  Goldings'  advice  and retained\r\n\nSegal to represent him with respect to the present charges.\r\n\n          On  prior  occasions,  Bucuvalas'   co-defendants,  the\r\n\nVenios'  and Bel-Art, had paid Bucuvalas' legal fees.  In keeping\r\n\nwith this  practice, Bucuvalas arranged  for them to  pay Segal's\r\n\nfee  in  the current  matter.   Upon  retaining  Segal, Bucuvalas\r\n\napprised Segal that he would be paid by Bucuvalas' co-defendants.\r\n\nGoldings was also aware of the payment plan.  Judge Woodlock, the\r\n\ndistrict  judge to whom the case was assigned, was never informed\r\n\nof the arrangement.\r\n\n          Segal took the case to trial.  He adopted a strategy in\r\n\nwhich  he sought to portray Bucuvalas as a low-level employee who\r\n\nwas  merely  following  his  employers'  orders  and  who  lacked\r\n\nknowledge of any wrongdoing.\r\n\n          As  part  of  his   strategy,  Segal  recommended  that\r\n\nBucuvalas  not  testify   at  trial.    Segal  feared   that  the\r\n\ngovernment's  cross-examination  of  Bucuvalas   would  undermine\r\n\nBucuvalas'  defense.    In  particular,  Segal  feared  that  the\r\n\ngovernment's cross-examination would reveal a prior conviction on\r\n\nsimilar charges  and would elicit  admissions to  several of  the\r\n\ncurrent charges.    Segal  was concerned  that  this  would  draw\r\n\nattention away from weaknesses in the government's case and focus\r\n\nit  instead on  Bucuvalas'  credibility.   Bucuvalas agreed  with\r\n\nSegal's analysis and chose not to testify.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n          On  August 16,  1990, Bucuvalas  and his  co-defendants\r\n\nwere convicted on all  counts of the indictment.   Judge Woodlock\r\n\nsentenced  Bucuvalas to  fifty-one months  in prison  followed by\r\n\nthree  years  of supervised  release.    This  court  upheld  his\r\n\nconviction on appeal.   United States v. Bucuvalas, 970  F.2d 937\r                                                            \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 959 (1993).\r                                       \r\n\n          On  November 25,  1994, Bucuvalas  moved to  vacate his\r\n\nsentence, pursuant to  28 U.S.C.   2255, asserting  violations of\r\n\nhis Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.  He\r\n\nclaimed that his rights were violated in two respects.  First, he\r\n\nargued  that  the  payment of  his  attorney's  fees  by his  co-\r\n\ndefendants created an unconstitutional conflict of interest under\r\n\nCuyler  v.  Sullivan,  446  U.S.  335  (1980).    In  particular,\r                              \r\n\nBucuvalas  claimed that  the fee  arrangement  influenced Segal's\r\n\nrecommendation  that Bucuvalas  not  testify, because  Bucuvalas'\r\n\ntestimony would  have shown  that his  co-defendants orchestrated\r\n\nthe  wrongdoing  and would  have  thereby  incriminated the  very\r\n\npersons paying Segal's fees.\r\n\n          Second,   Bucuvalas   claimed   that    Segal's   trial\r\n\nperformance was  deficient under  Strickland  v. Washington,  466\r                                                                     \r\n\nU.S. 668 (1984).  Bucuvalas alleged that Segal's treatment of the\r\n\nfee  arrangement   was  deficient,  because  he   neither  warned\r\n\nBucuvalas  of  the  risks  inherent in  the  payment  scheme, nor\r\n\ndisclosed  the arrangement  to the  trial court.   Bucuvalas also\r\n\nargued  that  Segal's advice  that he  not testify  was deficient\r\n\nbecause  his testimony  would have  been exculpatory.   Bucuvalas\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nclaims  that  it  would  have  demonstrated  that  he  was merely\r\n\nfollowing orders and that he lacked knowledge of any wrongdoing.\r\n\n          On March  4, 1996,  Judge Woodlock held  an evidentiary\r\n\nhearing.   He found that  the fee arrangement  did not create  an\r\n\nunconstitutional   conflict   of   interest   and   that  Segal's\r\n\nperformance was  not, in any  respect, deficient under  the Sixth\r\n\nAmendment.  Bucuvalas' petition, therefore, was denied.\r\n\n                               II.\r                                         II.\r\n\n                             Analysis\r                                       Analysis\r                                               \r\n\n          Bucuvalas   appeals   the   district  court's   rulings\r\n\nregarding both his Cuyler and Strickland claims.  We examine each\r                                                  \r\n\nseriatim.\r                  \r\n\nA.  The Cuyler Claim\r          A.  The Cuyler Claim\r                              \r\n\n          Bucuvalas  claims that  the payment  of his  attorney's\r\n\nfees by his co-defendants created an unconstitutional conflict of\r\n\ninterest.   As a threshold  matter, he asserts  that under United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates  v. Foster,  469 F.2d  1 (1st  Cir. 1972),  the government\r                           \r\n\nbears  the burden of persuasion on the issue, because the alleged\r\n\nconflict of interest was never addressed at trial by the district\r\n\ncourt.\r\n\n          1.  Foster and the Burden of Persuasion\r                    1.  Foster and the Burden of Persuasion\r                                                           \r\n\n          When  the  defendant  fails  to object  to  an  alleged\r\n\nconflict of interest, the  defendant bears the burden of  proving\r\n\nthat the alleged conflict  violates the Sixth Amendment.   United\r                                                                           \r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nStates  v.  Soldevila-L pez, 17  F.3d  480, 486  (1st  Cir. 1994)\r                                     \r\n\n(citing Cuyler, 446 U.S. at 348).\r                        \r\n\n          Pursuant  to  our supervisory  powers,  this  court has\r\n\ncarved out a limited exception to this rule.  Foster, 469 F.2d at\r                                                              \r\n\n4.   In  Foster, we  held that  district courts  are required  to\r                         \r\n\nintervene, sua  sponte, when  one lawyer represents  multiple co-\r                                \r\n\ndefendants.  Id.   In particular,  Foster requires that  district\r                                                   \r\n\ncourts apprise  defendants of the risks  associated with multiple\r\n\nrepresentation and  of their right to  a court-appointed attorney\r\n\nif necessary to avoid the multiple representation.  Id. at 5.  If\r                                                                 \r\n\na court  fails to conduct  an adequate inquiry,  Foster instructs\r                                                                 \r\n\nthat  the  burden  of  persuasion  shifts  to  the government  to\r\n\ndisprove  an alleged  conflict of  interest, given  an  appeal or\r\n\ncollateral  attack.    Id.    This  rule  seeks  to  address  the\r                                    \r\n\nheightened   danger    of   prejudice   inherent    in   multiple\r\n\nrepresentation.  Id. at 4.\r                              \r\n\n          Bucuvalas  argues  that he  was  entitled  to a  Foster\r                                                                           \r\n\nhearing.   Though he  did  not share  an  attorney with  his  co-\r\n\ndefendants, Bucuvalas claims that the fee arrangement  indirectly\r\n\nimplicated  the same concerns as multiple representation, because\r\n\nit subjected his attorney to the influence of  his co-defendants.\r\n\nSince  the district court did not inquire into his attorney's fee\r\n\narrangement, Bucuvalas  argues that  Foster shifts the  burden to\r                                                     \r\n\nthe government.\r\n\n          We reject  Bucuvalas'  argument and  decline to  extend\r\n\nFoster to these facts.  The Foster  rule is narrow.  See Brien v.\r                                                                        \r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nUnited  States,  695 F.2d  10, 14  (1st  Cir. 1982)  (refusing to\r                        \r\n\nextend  Foster and impose broader  duty on district  courts).  By\r                        \r\n\nits  own terms,  Foster  only applies  to \"criminal  prosecutions\r                                 \r\n\nwhere one attorney speaks for two or more defendants.\"  Id.  This\r                                                                     \r\n\ncase,  therefore,  does  not  come within  the  scope  of Foster,\r                                                                          \r\n\nbecause there was no  multiple representation.  Segal represented\r\n\nBucuvalas and no one else.\r\n\n          Moreover, Segal's  fee arrangement does not  foster the\r\n\nsame risks as  multiple representation.  While  we recognize \"the\r\n\ninherent  dangers  that  arise   when  a  criminal  defendant  is\r\n\nrepresented by a lawyer hired and paid by a third party,\" Wood v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nGeorgia, 450 U.S. 261, 268-69 (1981), these dangers are different\r                 \r\n\nfrom  those  arising  in  multiple  representation  cases.    The\r\n\nexistence  of separate  counsel interposes  a buffer  between the\r\n\ninterests of co-defendants which  does not exist when counsel  is\r\n\nshared.    In this  vein, this  court has  distinguished multiple\r\n\nrepresentation  from  independent  representation,  holding  that\r\n\n\"where dual  representation is involved, the  danger of conflicts\r\n\nis not  so great.\"  United  States v. DiCarlo, 575  F.2d 952, 957\r                                                       \r\n\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 834 (1978).\r                                  \r\n\n          As   here,    DiCarlo   did   not    involve   multiple\r                                         \r\n\nrepresentation.  It concerned  allegations that counsel abandoned\r\n\na defense strategy, because  it would have implicated prospective\r\n\nclients of his law partner.   Id. at 955-57.  Rejecting the Sixth\r                                           \r\n\nAmendment  claim, we  held there  to be  a presumption  that \"the\r\n\nlawyer  will subordinate  his pecuniary  interests and  honor his\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nprimary professional responsibility to  his clients in the matter\r\n\nat hand.\"  Id. at 957.  Here, the same presumption applies.\r                        \r\n\n          It  would  be inappropriate  and impractical  to extend\r\n\nFoster to the facts of this case.  To  do so would be to impose a\r                \r\n\nduty  on district courts  to inquire into  potential conflicts of\r\n\ninterest when  they have no  reason to know or  suspect that such\r\n\nconflicts might exist.   District judges  do not ordinarily  have\r\n\nreason to know  who is paying an attorney's fees  and we question\r\n\nwhether  it would  be appropriate  to require  them to  routinely\r\n\ninquire into such matters without any cause to do so.\r\n\n          Here,  Bucuvalas never brought  the alleged conflict of\r\n\ninterest to  Judge Woodlock's attention.   Indeed, Judge Woodlock\r\n\ndid not learn  of the contested  fee arrangement until  Bucuvalas\r\n\nfiled this petition, four years after the fact.\r\n\n          We  hold that,  where an  alleged conflict  of interest\r\n\ndoes not  involve multiple representation, where  no party raises\r\n\nthe   issue  before  the  court,  and  where  the  court  has  no\r\n\nindependent  reason to  know  of the  alleged conflict,  district\r\n\ncourts  have no  duty  to  inquire  into potential  conflicts  of\r\n\ninterest.  In  such circumstances, a district  court's failure to\r\n\ninquire does not shift  the burden of persuasion on  a subsequent\r\n\nSixth Amendment claim  to the  government.  It  follows that,  in\r\n\nthis case,  the district  court had no  duty to  inquire and  the\r\n\nburden of persuasion did not shift to the government.  The burden\r\n\nremained  on Bucuvalas to  establish an unconstitutional conflict\r\n\nof interest.\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\n          2.

To\r                                                    \r\n\nmeet this standard, the defendant must show that (1) the attorney\r\n\ncould have pursued a  plausible alternative defense strategy, and\r\n\n(2) the alternative strategy  was inherently in conflict  with or\r\n\nnot  undertaken   due  to  the  attorney's   other  interests  or\r\n\nloyalties.

When  an alleged  conflict of interest  is at\r\n\nissue, actual  prejudice need not  be established.   Id.; Cuyler,\r                                                                          \r\n\n446 U.S. at 349-50.\r\n\n          No  unconstitutional  conflict of  interest  existed in\r\n\nthis case.  Bucuvalas claims that a plausible alternative defense\r\n\nstrategy  existed in  that he  should have  testified on  his own\r\n\nbehalf to explain  that he was merely carrying out  the orders of\r\n\nhis co-defendants.   According to Bucuvalas,  Segal's advice that\r\n\nhe  not  testify  was  impermissibly  tainted because  Bucuvalas'\r\n\ntestimony would  have incriminated the  very persons  responsible\r\n\nfor Segal's fees.\r\n\n          The flaw in Bucuvalas'  argument is that his testifying\r\n\nwas not a  plausible alternative defense strategy.  Had Bucuvalas\r\n\ntestified,  a prior  conviction  on a  remarkably similar  charge\r\n\nwould have been introduced into evidence.  One of the allegations\r\n\nat  trial was that Bucuvalas  had bribed a  police detective; the\r\n\nprior  conviction was  for bribing  an  I.R.S. agent.   Moreover,\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\naccording to  Bucuvalas' own testimony during  the district court\r\n\nhearing on  his Sixth  Amendment claims,  his testimony  at trial\r\n\nwould have resulted in an  admission to the current charges.   We\r\n\nagree with Judge  Woodlock, who found  that Bucuvalas would  have\r\n\n\"offered  himself up  to  a cross-examinational  meat-grinder  on\r\n\nvirtually  every  relevant issue,  effectively  admitting to  the\r\n\nelements  of the offenses against  him and calling  to the jury's\r\n\nattention in a very specific way his role in this offense.\"1\r\n\n          Even if Bucuvalas had put forth a plausible alternative\r\n\nstrategy,   his  claim   would  still   fail  because   there  is\r\n\ninsufficient  evidence that  Segal's  advice was  tainted by  his\r\n\nrelationship  with Bucuvalas'  co-defendants.   A  defendant must\r\n\nshow   that   his  counsel   \"actively   represented  conflicting\r\n\ninterests.\"  Cuyler, 446 U.S.  at 350.  See also Carey  v.

Id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n1100.\r\n\n          Bucuvalas argues that  an actual  conflict of  interest\r\n\ncan  be inferred from Segal's fee arrangement.  The facts alleged\r\n\nby  Bucuvalas, however, are even less  suspect than those alleged\r\n\nin  Carey.  Bucuvalas had his own attorney, whereas the defendant\r                   \r\n\nin  Carey shared counsel  with a  co-defendant. See  DiCarlo, 575\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d at  957 (individual representation less  risky than multiple\r\n\nrepresentation).  Moreover, Bucuvalas  offers no additional facts\r\n\nto show that Segal had conflicting interests.\r\n\n          Significantly, Judge Woodlock,  who observed  firsthand\r\n\nthe  dynamics  of  the  trial  below,  explicitly  found  that no\r\n\nconflict existed,  stating, \"I do not find  that Mr. Segal in any\r\n\nfashion permitted himself to be directed by any other person  . .\r\n\n.  in his  professional judgment  with respect  to  the strategic\r\n\ndimensions  of this  case.\"   Bucuvalas has  failed to  show that\r\n\nSegal's  representation  was tainted  by  an  actual conflict  of\r\n\ninterest.\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\n          The Eleventh  Circuit addressed a similar  set of facts\r\n\nin Danner v.

Id. at  1168-69.  Like Bucuvalas, the defendant alleged\r                       \r\n\nthat counsel's  advice not  to testify conflicted  with counsel's\r\n\ninterest in receiving his fees because  such testimony would have\r\n\nincriminated  his co-defendants.   Id.   The  court held  that no\r                                                \r\n\nconflict of interest existed.  Id.\r                                            \r\n\n          For all  of these  reasons, we conclude  that Bucuvalas\r\n\nhas not met his burden of demonstrating that his attorney, Segal,\r\n\nlabored under an unconstitutional conflict of interest.\r\n\nB.

In making this determination, \"judicial scrutiny  of\r\n\ncounsel's  performance must  be highly  deferential.\" Strickland,\r                                                                          \r\n\n466 U.S. at 689.  \"A court must indulge a strong presumption that\r\n\ncounsel's  conduct  falls within  the  wide  range of  reasonable\r\n\nprofessional assistance.\"  Id.\r                                        \r\n\n          Bucuvalas   suggests   that  Segal's   performance  was\r\n\ndeficient in two  respects.  First,  Bucuvalas claims that  Segal\r\n\nshould  have discussed the  potential risks presented  by the fee\r\n\narrangement  with Bucuvalas  and  should have  disclosed the  fee\r\n\narrangement  to  the  court.    Segal's  failure  to  take  these\r\n\nmeasures,   however,  was  not   unreasonable.     An  attorney's\r\n\nobligation in such circumstances is encapsulated by Massachusetts\r\n\nSupreme Judicial Court Rule 3:07, DR 5-107.  It states, \"[e]xcept\r\n\nwith  the consent of his  client after full  disclosure, a lawyer\r\n\nshall not . .  . accept compensation for his  legal services from\r\n\none other than his client.\"  Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court\r\n\nRule 3:07, DR 5-107 (West 1996).  Segal fulfilled his obligations\r\n\nunder this  rule.   Bucuvalas' consent  was evident,  and further\r\n\ndisclosure was  not necessary because  Bucuvalas orchestrated the\r\n\nfee arrangement.   Judge Woodlock, in fact,  found that Bucuvalas\r\n\n\"was  fully  aware  of  the relationships  that  are  necessarily\r\n\ninvolved in  this  case  and, consequently,  made  his  own  good\r\n\njudgments or, at least, fair judgments about how to proceed . . .\r\n\n.\"\r\n\n          We agree  that Segal's handling of  the fee arrangement\r\n\ndid not constitute deficient performance.\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\n          Bucuvalas  also claims  that  Segal's  performance  was\r\n\ndeficient, because he should have advised Bucuvalas to testify on\r\n\nhis  own behalf.    In  Lema,  however,  this  court  found  that\r                                      \r\n\ncounsel's  advice that his client  not testify did not constitute\r\n\ndeficient performance  when such testimony would  have divulged a\r\n\nprior conviction.   Lema, 987  F.2d at  50-53.   Lema held  that,\r                                                               \r\n\n\"[u]naccompanied by coercion, legal advice concerning exercise of\r\n\nthe right to testify infringes no  right.\"  Id. at 52.

This case\r\n\nis,  therefore, analogous  to  Lema because  Bucuvalas' testimony\r                                             \r\n\nwould  have  divulged a  prior  conviction  for similar  charges.\r\n\nHere, in fact,  there was  an additional reason  not to  testify.\r\n\nHis testimony at trial  would likely have led to  an admission of\r\n\nseveral of the charges.  Judge Woodlock commented that \"[p]utting\r\n\nMr.  Bucuvalas on  the stand  in  these circumstances  would have\r\n\nopened  him up to a  scorching cross examination,\"  and that \"Mr.\r\n\nSegal  gave  the  recommendation  which,  frankly,  any competent\r\n\ncriminal  defense   attorney  would   have   given  under   these\r\n\ncircumstances, that  Mr. Bucuvalas not  take the witness  stand.\"\r\n\nWe agree.   Segal gave Bucuvalas the  best possible advice.   His\r\n\nperformance was  not constitutionally  deficient in  any respect.\r\n\nBucuvalas has,  therefore, failed to  satisfy the first  prong of\r\n\nStrickland.\r                    \r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\n          Even   if  Bucuvalas   had  established   that  Segal's\r\n\nperformance was deficient,  his claim still fails  because he has\r\n\nnot satisfied  the second prong  of Strickland, which  requires a\r                                                        \r\n\nshowing  of prejudice.  To  establish prejudice, a defendant must\r\n\nshow  that  \"there  is  a reasonable  probability  that,  but for\r\n\ncounsel's unprofessional  errors, the  result  of the  proceeding\r\n\nwould  have  been  different.\"    Strickland, 466  U.S.  at  694;\r                                                      \r\n\nArgencourt, 78 F.3d  at 16.   Bucuvalas claims  that, absent  the\r                    \r\n\nalleged errors,  he would have taken the  stand on his own behalf\r\n\nand, as a result, he would not have been convicted.  We disagree.\r\n\nHad Bucuvalas  testified, the likelihood of  his conviction would\r\n\nhave  been increased by the introduction  of the prior conviction\r\n\nand by Bucuvalas'  inevitable admissions.  We find that Bucuvalas\r\n\nhas  failed  to  establish   prejudice  and  cannot,   therefore,\r\n\nestablish a Sixth Amendment violation under Strickland.\r                                                                \r\n\n                               III.\r                                         III.\r\n\n                            Conclusion\r                                      Conclusion\r\n\n          For the  reasons discussed above, we  find that neither\r\n\ncounsel's fee arrangement nor counsel's advice that Appellant not\r\n\ntestify violated Appellant's  Sixth Amendment right  to effective\r\n\nassistance of counsel.\r\n\n          AFFIRMED.\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n",

Essentially, Bucuvalas asserts that his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel was violated because his attorney's fees were paid by his co-defendants and because his attorney advised him not to testify on his own behalf.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 15, 1989, George Bucuvalas was indicted in the District of Massachusetts for participating in, and conspiring to participate in, a pattern of racketeering activity in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(c)-(d), for mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1341 and 1342, and for conspiracy to commit mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371.  His employers--Arthur Venios, Christy Venios, and Bel-Art Realty, Inc.  (\"Bel-Art\")--were indicted for the same offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Venios' and Bel-Art retained attorney Morris Goldings to represent them at trial.  Bucuvalas subsequently sought to retain Goldings as well.  Goldings was not willing, however, to represent both Bucuvalas and his co-defendants.  He, therefore, referred Bucuvalas to Attorney Terry Segal, whom Bucuvalas had retained on past occasions.  Segal represented Bucuvalas in a criminal tax investigation which did not result in an indictment and in a trial for bribery which resulted in a split verdict.  Apparently satisfied with Segal's past representation, Bucuvalas took Goldings' advice and retained Segal to represent him with respect to the present charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On prior occasions, Bucuvalas' co-defendants, the Venios' and Bel-Art, had paid Bucuvalas' legal fees.  In keeping with this practice, Bucuvalas arranged for them to pay Segal's fee in the current matter.  Upon retaining Segal, Bucuvalas apprised Segal that he would be paid by Bucuvalas' co-defendants.  Goldings was also aware of the payment plan.  Judge Woodlock, the district judge to whom the case was assigned, was never informed of the arrangement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Segal took the case to trial.  He adopted a strategy in which he sought to portray Bucuvalas as a low-level employee who was merely following his employers' orders and who lacked knowledge of any wrongdoing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As part of his strategy, Segal recommended that Bucuvalas not testify at trial.  Segal feared that the government's cross-examination of Bucuvalas would undermine Bucuvalas' defense.  In particular, Segal feared that the government's cross-examination would reveal a prior conviction on similar charges and would elicit admissions to several of the current charges.  Segal was concerned that this would draw attention away from weaknesses in the government's case and focus it instead on Bucuvalas' credibility.  Bucuvalas agreed with Segal's analysis and chose not to testify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 16, 1990, Bucuvalas and his co-defendants were convicted on all counts of the indictment.  Judge Woodlock sentenced Bucuvalas to fifty-one months in prison followed by three years of supervised release.  This court upheld his conviction on appeal.  United States v. Bucuvalas, 970 F.2d 937 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 959, 113 S.Ct. 1382, 122 L.Ed.2d 758 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 25, 1994, Bucuvalas moved to vacate his sentence, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255, asserting violations of his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.  He claimed that his rights were violated in two respects.  First, he argued that the payment of his attorney's fees by his co-defendants created an unconstitutional conflict of interest under Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980).  In particular, Bucuvalas claimed that the fee arrangement influenced Segal's recommendation that Bucuvalas not testify, because Bucuvalas' testimony would have shown that his co-defendants orchestrated the wrongdoing and would have thereby incriminated the very persons paying Segal's fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Bucuvalas claimed that Segal's trial performance was deficient under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).  Bucuvalas alleged that Segal's treatment of the fee arrangement was deficient, because he neither warned Bucuvalas of the risks inherent in the payment scheme, nor disclosed the arrangement to the trial court.  Bucuvalas also argued that Segal's advice that he not testify was deficient because his testimony would have been exculpatory.  Bucuvalas claims that it would have demonstrated that he was merely following orders and that he lacked knowledge of any wrongdoing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 4, 1996, Judge Woodlock held an evidentiary hearing.  He found that the fee arrangement did not create an unconstitutional conflict of interest and that Segal's performance was not, in any respect, deficient under the Sixth Amendment.  Bucuvalas' petition, therefore, was denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bucuvalas appeals the district court's rulings regarding both his Cuyler and Strickland claims.  We examine each seriatim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. The Cuyler Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bucuvalas claims that the payment of his attorney's fees by his co-defendants created an unconstitutional conflict of interest.  As a threshold matter, he asserts that under United States v. Foster, 469 F.2d 1 (1st Cir.1972), the government bears the burden of persuasion on the issue, because the alleged conflict of interest was never addressed at trial by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Foster and the Burden of Persuasion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the defendant fails to object to an alleged conflict of interest, the defendant bears the burden of proving that the alleged conflict violates the Sixth Amendment.  United States v. Soldevila-Lpez, 17 F.3d 480, 486 (1st Cir.1994) (citing Cuyler, 446 U.S. at 348, 100 S.Ct. at 1718).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to our supervisory powers, this court has carved out a limited exception to this rule.  Foster, 469 F.2d at 4. In Foster, we held that district courts are required to intervene, sua sponte, when one lawyer represents multiple co-defendants.  Id. In particular, Foster requires that district courts apprise defendants of the risks associated with multiple representation and of their right to a court-appointed attorney if necessary to avoid the multiple representation.  Id. at 5. If a court fails to conduct an adequate inquiry, Foster instructs that the burden of persuasion shifts to the government to disprove an alleged conflict of interest, given an appeal or collateral attack.  Id. This rule seeks to address the heightened danger of prejudice inherent in multiple representation.  Id. at 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bucuvalas argues that he was entitled to a Foster hearing.  Though he did not share an attorney with his co-defendants, Bucuvalas claims that the fee arrangement indirectly implicated the same concerns as multiple representation, because it subjected his attorney to the influence of his co-defendants.  Since the district court did not inquire into his attorney's fee arrangement, Bucuvalas argues that Foster shifts the burden to the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject Bucuvalas' argument and decline to extend Foster to these facts.  The Foster rule is narrow.  See Brien v. United States, 695 F.2d 10, 14 (1st Cir.1982) (refusing to extend Foster and impose broader duty on district courts).  By its own terms, Foster only applies to \"criminal prosecutions where one attorney speaks for two or more defendants.\"  Id. This case, therefore, does not come within the scope of Foster, because there was no multiple representation.  Segal represented Bucuvalas and no one else.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Segal's fee arrangement does not foster the same risks as multiple representation.  While we recognize \"the inherent dangers that arise when a criminal defendant is represented by a lawyer hired and paid by a third party,\" Wood v. Georgia, 450 U.S. 261, 268-69, 101 S.Ct. 1097, 1102, 67 L.Ed.2d 220 (1981), these dangers are different from those arising in multiple representation cases.  The existence of separate counsel interposes a buffer between the interests of co-defendants which does not exist when counsel is shared.  In this vein, this court has distinguished multiple representation from independent representation, holding that \"where dual representation is involved, the danger of conflicts is not so great.\"  United States v. DiCarlo, 575 F.2d 952, 957 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 834, 99 S.Ct. 115, 58 L.Ed.2d 129 (1978).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As here, DiCarlo did not involve multiple representation.  It concerned allegations that counsel abandoned a defense strategy, because it would have implicated prospective clients of his law partner.  Id. at 955-57.   Rejecting the Sixth Amendment claim, we held there to be a presumption that \"the lawyer will subordinate his pecuniary interests and honor his primary professional responsibility to his clients in the matter at hand.\"  Id. at 957.   Here, the same presumption applies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It would be inappropriate and impractical to extend Foster to the facts of this case.  To do so would be to impose a duty on district courts to inquire into potential conflicts of interest when they have no reason to know or suspect that such conflicts might exist.  District judges do not ordinarily have reason to know who is paying an attorney's fees and we question whether it would be appropriate to require them to routinely inquire into such matters without any cause to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Bucuvalas never brought the alleged conflict of interest to Judge Woodlock's attention.  Indeed, Judge Woodlock did not learn of the contested fee arrangement until Bucuvalas filed this petition, four years after the fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that, where an alleged conflict of interest does not involve multiple representation, where no party raises the issue before the court, and where the court has no independent reason to know of the alleged conflict, district courts have no duty to inquire into potential conflicts of interest.  In such circumstances, a district court's failure to inquire does not shift the burden of persuasion on a subsequent Sixth Amendment claim to the government.  It follows that, in this case, the district court had no duty to inquire and the burden of persuasion did not shift to the government.  The burden remained on Bucuvalas to establish an unconstitutional conflict of interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Conflict of Interest Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel is violated when an actual conflict of interest adversely affects counsel's representation.  Cuyler, 446 U.S. at 348, 100 S.Ct. at 1718.   To meet this standard, the defendant must show that (1) the attorney could have pursued a plausible alternative defense strategy, and (2) the alternative strategy was inherently in conflict with or not undertaken due to the attorney's other interests or loyalties.  United States v. Soldevila-Lpez, 17 F.3d 480, 486 (1st Cir.1994).  When an alleged conflict of interest is at issue, actual prejudice need not be established.  Id.; Cuyler, 446 U.S. at 349-50, 100 S.Ct. at 1718-19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No unconstitutional conflict of interest existed in this case.  Bucuvalas claims that a plausible alternative defense strategy existed in that he should have testified on his own behalf to explain that he was merely carrying out the orders of his co-defendants.  According to Bucuvalas, Segal's advice that he not testify was impermissibly tainted because Bucuvalas' testimony would have incriminated the very persons responsible for Segal's fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The flaw in Bucuvalas' argument is that his testifying was not a plausible alternative defense strategy.  Had Bucuvalas testified, a prior conviction on a remarkably similar charge would have been introduced into evidence.  One of the allegations at trial was that Bucuvalas had bribed a police detective;  the prior conviction was for bribing an I.R.S. agent.  Moreover, according to Bucuvalas' own testimony during the district court hearing on his Sixth Amendment claims, his testimony at trial would have resulted in an admission to the current charges.  We agree with Judge Woodlock, who found that Bucuvalas would have \"offered himself up to a cross-examinational meat-grinder on virtually every relevant issue, effectively admitting to the elements of the offenses against him and calling to the jury's attention in a very specific way his role in this offense.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if Bucuvalas had put forth a plausible alternative strategy, his claim would still fail because there is insufficient evidence that Segal's advice was tainted by his relationship with Bucuvalas' co-defendants.  A defendant must show that his counsel \"actively represented conflicting interests.\"  Cuyler, 446 U.S. at 350, 100 S.Ct. at 1719.   See also Carey v. United States, 50 F.3d 1097, 1100 (1st Cir.1995) (\"the defendant must demonstrate that the alleged conflict is more than 'some attenuated hypothesis having little consequence to the adequacy of representation' \") (citing Brien v. United States, 695 F.2d 10, 15 (1st Cir.1982));  Soldevila- Lpez, 17 F.3d at 487 (\"theoretical or merely speculative conflict of interest\" does not constitute Sixth Amendment violation).  In Carey, for instance, counsel simultaneously represented co-defendants and advised one not to divulge any information regarding the other when cooperating with the government.  Carey, 50 F.3d at 1099-1100.   The cooperating defendant alleged that this advice precluded him from obtaining a sentence reduction.  Id. at 1101.   The court held that the link between counsel's advice and counsel's interest in protecting his other client was too speculative to establish an actual conflict of interest.  Id. at 1100.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bucuvalas argues that an actual conflict of interest can be inferred from Segal's fee arrangement.  The facts alleged by Bucuvalas, however, are even less suspect than those alleged in Carey.   Bucuvalas had his own attorney, whereas the defendant in Carey shared counsel with a co-defendant.  See DiCarlo, 575 F.2d at 957 (individual representation less risky than multiple representation).  Moreover, Bucuvalas offers no additional facts to show that Segal had conflicting interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Significantly, Judge Woodlock, who observed firsthand the dynamics of the trial below, explicitly found that no conflict existed, stating, \"I do not find that Mr. Segal in any fashion permitted himself to be directed by any other person ... in his professional judgment with respect to the strategic dimensions of this case.\"   Bucuvalas has failed to show that Segal's representation was tainted by an actual conflict of interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Eleventh Circuit addressed a similar set of facts in Danner v. United States, 820 F.2d 1166 (11th Cir.1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1012, 108 S.Ct. 713, 98 L.Ed.2d 663 (1988), and arrived at the same conclusion.  In Danner, counsel's fees were paid through co-defendant's counsel.  Id. at 1168-69.   Like Bucuvalas, the defendant alleged that counsel's advice not to testify conflicted with counsel's interest in receiving his fees because such testimony would have incriminated his co-defendants.  Id. The court held that no conflict of interest existed.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For all of these reasons, we conclude that Bucuvalas has not met his burden of demonstrating that his attorney, Segal, labored under an unconstitutional conflict of interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Strickland Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bucuvalas alternatively claims that his Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated by strategic errors made by Segal.  Under Strickland v. Washington, a Sixth Amendment violation occurs when (1) counsel's performance was deficient, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064.   The defendant bears the burden of proving both prongs of this test.  Id. This burden is heavy.  Argencourt v. United States, 78 F.3d 14, 16 (1st Cir.1996);  Lema v. United States, 987 F.2d 48, 51 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counsel's performance is deficient under Strickland 's first prong when it is \"so inferior as to be objectively unreasonable.\"  United States v. McGill, 11 F.3d 223, 226 (1st Cir.1993).  In making this determination, \"judicial scrutiny of counsel's performance must be highly deferential.\"  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065.  \"A court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel's conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bucuvalas suggests that Segal's performance was deficient in two respects.  First, Bucuvalas claims that Segal should have discussed the potential risks presented by the fee arrangement with Bucuvalas and should have disclosed the fee arrangement to the court.  Segal's failure to take these measures, however, was not unreasonable.  An attorney's obligation in such circumstances is encapsulated by Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Rule 3:07, DR 5-107.  It states, \"[e]xcept with the consent of his client after full disclosure, a lawyer shall not ... accept compensation for his legal services from one other than his client.\"   Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Rule 3:07, DR 5-107 (West 1996).  Segal fulfilled his obligations under this rule.  Bucuvalas' consent was evident, and further disclosure was not necessary because Bucuvalas orchestrated the fee arrangement.  Judge Woodlock, in fact, found that Bucuvalas \"was fully aware of the relationships that are necessarily involved in this case and, consequently, made his own good judgments or, at least, fair judgments about how to proceed....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree that Segal's handling of the fee arrangement did not constitute deficient performance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bucuvalas also claims that Segal's performance was deficient, because he should have advised Bucuvalas to testify on his own behalf.  In Lema, however, this court found that counsel's advice that his client not testify did not constitute deficient performance when such testimony would have divulged a prior conviction.  Lema, 987 F.2d at 50-53.  Lema held that, \"[u]naccompanied by coercion, legal advice concerning exercise of the right to testify infringes no right.\"  Id. at 52.   See also United States v. Teague, 953 F.2d 1525, 1534-35 (11th Cir.)  (en banc ), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 842, 113 S.Ct. 127, 121 L.Ed.2d 82 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bucuvalas makes no allegations of coercion.  This case is, therefore, analogous to Lema because Bucuvalas' testimony would have divulged a prior conviction for similar charges.  Here, in fact, there was an additional reason not to testify.  His testimony at trial would likely have led to an admission of several of the charges.  Judge Woodlock commented that \"[p]utting Mr. Bucuvalas on the stand in these circumstances would have opened him up to a scorching cross examination,\" and that \"Mr. Segal gave the recommendation which, frankly, any competent criminal defense attorney would have given under these circumstances, that Mr. Bucuvalas not take the witness stand.\"   We agree.  Segal gave Bucuvalas the best possible advice.  His performance was not constitutionally deficient in any respect.  Bucuvalas has, therefore, failed to satisfy the first prong of Strickland.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if Bucuvalas had established that Segal's performance was deficient, his claim still fails because he has not satisfied the second prong of Strickland, which requires a showing of prejudice.  To establish prejudice, a defendant must show that \"there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\"  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068;  Argencourt, 78 F.3d at 16.   Bucuvalas claims that, absent the alleged errors, he would have taken the stand on his own behalf and, as a result, he would not have been convicted.  We disagree.

Essentially, Bucuvalas asserts that his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel was violated because his attorney's fees were paid by his co-defendants and because his attorney advised him not to testify on his own behalf.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 15, 1989, George Bucuvalas was indicted in the District of Massachusetts for participating in, and conspiring to participate in, a pattern of racketeering activity in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(c)-(d), for mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1341 and 1342, and for conspiracy to commit mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371.  His employers--Arthur Venios, Christy Venios, and Bel-Art Realty, Inc.  (\"Bel-Art\")--were indicted for the same offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Venios' and Bel-Art retained attorney Morris Goldings to represent them at trial.  Bucuvalas subsequently sought to retain Goldings as well.  Goldings was not willing, however, to represent both Bucuvalas and his co-defendants.  He, therefore, referred Bucuvalas to Attorney Terry Segal, whom Bucuvalas had retained on past occasions.  Segal represented Bucuvalas in a criminal tax investigation which did not result in an indictment and in a trial for bribery which resulted in a split verdict.  Apparently satisfied with Segal's past representation, Bucuvalas took Goldings' advice and retained Segal to represent him with respect to the present charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On prior occasions, Bucuvalas' co-defendants, the Venios' and Bel-Art, had paid Bucuvalas' legal fees.  In keeping with this practice, Bucuvalas arranged for them to pay Segal's fee in the current matter.  Upon retaining Segal, Bucuvalas apprised Segal that he would be paid by Bucuvalas' co-defendants.  Goldings was also aware of the payment plan.  Judge Woodlock, the district judge to whom the case was assigned, was never informed of the arrangement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Segal took the case to trial.  He adopted a strategy in which he sought to portray Bucuvalas as a low-level employee who was merely following his employers' orders and who lacked knowledge of any wrongdoing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As part of his strategy, Segal recommended that Bucuvalas not testify at trial.  Segal feared that the government's cross-examination of Bucuvalas would undermine Bucuvalas' defense.  In particular, Segal feared that the government's cross-examination would reveal a prior conviction on similar charges and would elicit admissions to several of the current charges.  Segal was concerned that this would draw attention away from weaknesses in the government's case and focus it instead on Bucuvalas' credibility.  Bucuvalas agreed with Segal's analysis and chose not to testify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 16, 1990, Bucuvalas and his co-defendants were convicted on all counts of the indictment.  Judge Woodlock sentenced Bucuvalas to fifty-one months in prison followed by three years of supervised release.  This court upheld his conviction on appeal.  United States v.

He claimed that his rights were violated in two respects.  First, he argued that the payment of his attorney's fees by his co-defendants created an unconstitutional conflict of interest under Cuyler v. Sullivan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110256\"><a href=\"/opinion/110256/cuyler-v-sullivan/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110256\"><a href=\"/opinion/110256/cuyler-v-sullivan/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">333</span></a></span> (1980).  In particular, Bucuvalas claimed that the fee arrangement influenced Segal's recommendation that Bucuvalas not testify, because Bucuvalas' testimony would have shown that his co-defendants orchestrated the wrongdoing and would have thereby incriminated the very persons paying Segal's fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Bucuvalas claimed that Segal's trial performance was deficient under Strickland v. Washington, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">674</span></a></span> (1984).  Bucuvalas alleged that Segal's treatment of the fee arrangement was deficient, because he neither warned Bucuvalas of the risks inherent in the payment scheme, nor disclosed the arrangement to the trial court.  Bucuvalas also argued that Segal's advice that he not testify was deficient because his testimony would have been exculpatory.  Bucuvalas claims that it would have demonstrated that he was merely following orders and that he lacked knowledge of any wrongdoing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 4, 1996, Judge Woodlock held an evidentiary hearing.  He found that the fee arrangement did not create an unconstitutional conflict of interest and that Segal's performance was not, in any respect, deficient under the Sixth Amendment.  Bucuvalas' petition, therefore, was denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bucuvalas appeals the district court's rulings regarding both his Cuyler and Strickland claims.

Foster, 469 F.2d at 4. In Foster, we held that district courts are required to intervene, sua sponte, when one lawyer represents multiple co-defendants.  Id. In particular, Foster requires that district courts apprise defendants of the risks associated with multiple representation and of their right to a court-appointed attorney if necessary to avoid the multiple representation.  Id. at 5. If a court fails to conduct an adequate inquiry, Foster instructs that the burden of persuasion shifts to the government to disprove an alleged conflict of interest, given an appeal or collateral attack.  Id. This rule seeks to address the heightened danger of prejudice inherent in multiple representation.  Id. at 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bucuvalas argues that he was entitled to a Foster hearing.  Though he did not share an attorney with his co-defendants, Bucuvalas claims that the fee arrangement indirectly implicated the same concerns as multiple representation, because it subjected his attorney to the influence of his co-defendants.  Since the district court did not inquire into his attorney's fee arrangement, Bucuvalas argues that Foster shifts the burden to the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject Bucuvalas' argument and decline to extend Foster to these facts.  The Foster rule is narrow.  See Brien v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"411729\"><a href=\"/opinion/411729/james-a-brien-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">695</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir.1982) (refusing to extend Foster and impose broader duty on district courts).  By its own terms, Foster only applies to \"criminal prosecutions where one attorney speaks for two or more defendants.\"  Id. This case, therefore, does not come within the scope of Foster, because there was no multiple representation.  Segal represented Bucuvalas and no one else.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Segal's fee arrangement does not foster the same risks as multiple representation.  While we recognize \"the inherent dangers that arise when a criminal defendant is represented by a lawyer hired and paid by a third party,\" Wood v. Georgia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110425\"><a href=\"/opinion/110425/wood-v-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">261</span></a></span>, 268-69, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110425\"><a href=\"/opinion/110425/wood-v-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span> (1981), these dangers are different from those arising in multiple representation cases.  The existence of separate counsel interposes a buffer between the interests of co-defendants which does not exist when counsel is shared.  In this vein, this court has distinguished multiple representation from independent representation, holding that \"where dual representation is involved, the danger of conflicts is not so great.\"  United States v. DiCarlo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"355655\"><a href=\"/opinion/355655/united-states-v-joseph-j-c-dicarlo-and-ronald-c-mackenzie/\"><span class=\"volume\">575</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">952</span></a></span>, 957 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">834</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It concerned allegations that counsel abandoned a defense strategy, because it would have implicated prospective clients of his law partner.  Id. at 955-57.   Rejecting the Sixth Amendment claim, we held there to be a presumption that \"the lawyer will subordinate his pecuniary interests and honor his primary professional responsibility to his clients in the matter at hand.\"  Id. at 957.   Here, the same presumption applies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It would be inappropriate and impractical to extend Foster to the facts of this case.  To do so would be to impose a duty on district courts to inquire into potential conflicts of interest when they have no reason to know or suspect that such conflicts might exist.  District judges do not ordinarily have reason to know who is paying an attorney's fees and we question whether it would be appropriate to require them to routinely inquire into such matters without any cause to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Bucuvalas never brought the alleged conflict of interest to Judge Woodlock's attention.  Indeed, Judge Woodlock did not learn of the contested fee arrangement until Bucuvalas filed this petition, four years after the fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that, where an alleged conflict of interest does not involve multiple representation, where no party raises the issue before the court, and where the court has no independent reason to know of the alleged conflict, district courts have no duty to inquire into potential conflicts of interest.  In such circumstances, a district court's failure to inquire does not shift the burden of persuasion on a subsequent Sixth Amendment claim to the government.  It follows that, in this case, the district court had no duty to inquire and the burden of persuasion did not shift to the government.  The burden remained on Bucuvalas to establish an unconstitutional conflict of interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Conflict of Interest Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel is violated when an actual conflict of interest adversely affects counsel's representation.  Cuyler, 446 U.S. at 348, 100 S.Ct. at 1718.   To meet this standard, the defendant must show that (1) the attorney could have pursued a plausible alternative defense strategy, and (2) the alternative strategy was inherently in conflict with or not undertaken due to the attorney's other interests or loyalties.  United States v. Soldevila-Lpez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"664046\"><a href=\"/opinion/664046/united-states-v-angel-a-soldevila-lopez-aka-angelo/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></a></span>, 486 (1st Cir.1994).  When an alleged conflict of interest is at issue, actual prejudice need not be established.  Id.; Cuyler, 446 U.S. at 349-50, 100 S.Ct. at 1718-19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No unconstitutional conflict of interest existed in this case.  Bucuvalas claims that a plausible alternative defense strategy existed in that he should have testified on his own behalf to explain that he was merely carrying out the orders of his co-defendants.  According to Bucuvalas, Segal's advice that he not testify was impermissibly tainted because Bucuvalas' testimony would have incriminated the very persons responsible for Segal's fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The flaw in Bucuvalas' argument is that his testifying was not a plausible alternative defense strategy.  Had Bucuvalas testified, a prior conviction on a remarkably similar charge would have been introduced into evidence.  One of the allegations at trial was that Bucuvalas had bribed a police detective;  the prior conviction was for bribing an I.R.S. agent.  Moreover, according to Bucuvalas' own testimony during the district court hearing on his Sixth Amendment claims, his testimony at trial would have resulted in an admission to the current charges.  We agree with Judge Woodlock, who found that Bucuvalas would have \"offered himself up to a cross-examinational meat-grinder on virtually every relevant issue, effectively admitting to the elements of the offenses against him and calling to the jury's attention in a very specific way his role in this offense.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if Bucuvalas had put forth a plausible alternative strategy, his claim would still fail because there is insufficient evidence that Segal's advice was tainted by his relationship with Bucuvalas' co-defendants.  A defendant must show that his counsel \"actively represented conflicting interests.\"  Cuyler, 446 U.S. at 350, 100 S.Ct. at 1719.   See also Carey v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"692274\"><a href=\"/opinion/692274/martin-carey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1097</span></a></span>, 1100 (1st Cir.1995) (\"the defendant must demonstrate that the alleged conflict is more than 'some attenuated hypothesis having little consequence to the adequacy of representation' \") (citing Brien v.

In Carey, for instance, counsel simultaneously represented co-defendants and advised one not to divulge any information regarding the other when cooperating with the government.  Carey, 50 F.3d at 1099-1100.   The cooperating defendant alleged that this advice precluded him from obtaining a sentence reduction.  Id. at 1101.   The court held that the link between counsel's advice and counsel's interest in protecting his other client was too speculative to establish an actual conflict of interest.  Id. at 1100.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bucuvalas argues that an actual conflict of interest can be inferred from Segal's fee arrangement.  The facts alleged by Bucuvalas, however, are even less suspect than those alleged in Carey.   Bucuvalas had his own attorney, whereas the defendant in Carey shared counsel with a co-defendant.  See DiCarlo, 575 F.2d at 957 (individual representation less risky than multiple representation).

Like Bucuvalas, the defendant alleged that counsel's advice not to testify conflicted with counsel's interest in receiving his fees because such testimony would have incriminated his co-defendants.  Id. The court held that no conflict of interest existed.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For all of these reasons, we conclude that Bucuvalas has not met his burden of demonstrating that his attorney, Segal, labored under an unconstitutional conflict of interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Strickland Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bucuvalas alternatively claims that his Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated by strategic errors made by Segal.  Under Strickland v. Washington, a Sixth Amendment violation occurs when (1) counsel's performance was deficient, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064.   The defendant bears the burden of proving both prongs of this test.  Id. This burden is heavy.  Argencourt v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196633\"><a href=\"/opinion/196633/argencourt-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir.1996);  Lema v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601483\"><a href=\"/opinion/601483/charles-d-lema-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span>, 51 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counsel's performance is deficient under Strickland 's first prong when it is \"so inferior as to be objectively unreasonable.\"  United States v. McGill, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195053\"><a href=\"/opinion/195053/united-states-v-mcgill/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span>, 226 (1st Cir.1993).  In making this determination, \"judicial scrutiny of counsel's performance must be highly deferential.\"  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065.  \"A court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel's conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bucuvalas suggests that Segal's performance was deficient in two respects.  First, Bucuvalas claims that Segal should have discussed the potential risks presented by the fee arrangement with Bucuvalas and should have disclosed the fee arrangement to the court.  Segal's failure to take these measures, however, was not unreasonable.  An attorney's obligation in such circumstances is encapsulated by Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Rule 3:07, DR 5-107.  It states, \"[e]xcept with the consent of his client after full disclosure, a lawyer shall not ... accept compensation for his legal services from one other than his client.\"   Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Rule 3:07, DR 5-107 (West 1996).  Segal fulfilled his obligations under this rule.  Bucuvalas' consent was evident, and further disclosure was not necessary because Bucuvalas orchestrated the fee arrangement.  Judge Woodlock, in fact, found that Bucuvalas \"was fully aware of the relationships that are necessarily involved in this case and, consequently, made his own good judgments or, at least, fair judgments about how to proceed....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree that Segal's handling of the fee arrangement did not constitute deficient performance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bucuvalas also claims that Segal's performance was deficient, because he should have advised Bucuvalas to testify on his own behalf.  In Lema, however, this court found that counsel's advice that his client not testify did not constitute deficient performance when such testimony would have divulged a prior conviction.  Lema, 987 F.2d at 50-53.  Lema held that, \"[u]naccompanied by coercion, legal advice concerning exercise of the right to testify infringes no right.\"  Id. at 52.   See also United States v. Teague, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"576208\"><a href=\"/opinion/576208/united-states-v-donald-teague/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1525</span></a></span>, 1534-35 (11th Cir.)  (en banc ), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">842</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">127</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">82</span></span> (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bucuvalas makes no allegations of coercion.  This case is, therefore, analogous to Lema because Bucuvalas' testimony would have divulged a prior conviction for similar charges.  Here, in fact, there was an additional reason not to testify.  His testimony at trial would likely have led to an admission of several of the charges.  Judge Woodlock commented that \"[p]utting Mr. Bucuvalas on the stand in these circumstances would have opened him up to a scorching cross examination,\" and that \"Mr. Segal gave the recommendation which, frankly, any competent criminal defense attorney would have given under these circumstances, that Mr. Bucuvalas not take the witness stand.\"   We agree.  Segal gave Bucuvalas the best possible advice.  His performance was not constitutionally deficient in any respect.  Bucuvalas has, therefore, failed to satisfy the first prong of Strickland.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if Bucuvalas had established that Segal's performance was deficient, his claim still fails because he has not satisfied the second prong of Strickland, which requires a showing of prejudice.  To establish prejudice, a defendant must show that \"there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\"  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068;  Argencourt, 78 F.3d at 16.   Bucuvalas claims that, absent the alleged errors, he would have taken the stand on his own behalf and, as a result, he would not have been convicted.  We disagree.  Had Bucuvalas testified, the likelihood of his conviction would have been increased by the introduction of the prior conviction and by Bucuvalas' inevitable admissions.  We find that Bucuvalas has failed to establish prejudice and cannot, therefore, establish a Sixth Amendment violation under Strickland.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons discussed above, we find that neither counsel's fee arrangement nor counsel's advice that Appellant not testify violated Appellant's Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Chief Judge of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The standard by which this court reviews findings of the district court in ineffective assistance of counsel claims raised on collateral attack is not clear.
