Defendants Allen\r                                                     \r\n\nAdams  and Tad Page pled guilty to three counts of conspiracy\r\n\nand interference with the civil rights of others in September\r\n\nof  1992.   They now object  to virtually  every step  of the\r\n\ncourt's   application  of   the  Sentencing   Guidelines  and\r\n\nunderlying statutes to their offenses.  We affirm.\r\n\n          According to pre-sentence  reports accepted by  the\r\n\ncourt,  in  the  early  hours of  September  19,  1992, Adams\r\n\naccosted  Ruben Gonzales, Oscar  Luna and Emiliano Valenzuela\r\n\nas they attempted to enter a  convenience store, calling them\r\n\n\"f        Mexicans\" who should  go back to  Mexico where they\r\n\n\"belonged,\" and offering  to send  them back in  a body  bag.\r\n\nPage joined Adams, who grabbed Page's handgun from inside his\r\n\ntruck, stuck it  to Gonzales' temple and  threatened to \"blow\r\n\nhis  head off.\"    An employee  called the  police, whereupon\r\n\nGonzales and his  companions drove off  with a fourth  friend\r\n\nwho had  remained in their car.  Page jumped in his truck and\r\n\nfollowed,  with  Adams  in the  passenger  seat  and  the gun\r\n\nbetween  them, and  two cohorts  riding in  back.   Two other\r\n\ncarloads of their friends joined the chase.  Driving about 75\r\n\nmiles an  hour, Page  pulled up  behind Gonzales'  car, fired\r\n\nseven  shots into  the air,  and at  Adams' urging,  two more\r\n\ndirectly  into the back of the  vehicle and two at the ground\r\n\nbehind it.  One bullet struck Luna in the arm, another lodged\r\n\nin  the headrest behind Gonzales' head.  Page then slowed and\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nturned back.  Luna  was taken to a hospital  shortly, treated\r\n\nfor  a  gunshot wound  to his  right  upper arm  and released\r\n\napproximately 90 minutes  later.  He lost use of  his arm and\r\n\nwas unable to work  for three weeks, and continued  to suffer\r\n\nresidual pain for some time.\r\n\n          Pursuant to  a plea agreement, Adams  and Page each\r\n\npled guilty  to  conspiracy  to hinder  others  in  the  free\r\n\nexercise  of federally  secured  rights, in  violation of  18\r\n\nU.S.C.   241 (count I), racially motivated  interference with\r\n\nGonzales' use of a  public accommodation, in violation  of 18\r\n\nU.S.C.    245(b)(2)(F)  and 2  (count  II), and  interference\r\n\nwith  Luna's  use   of  same,  in  violation   of  18  U.S.C.\r\n\n   245(b)(4)(A) and 2 (count IV).  In return, the  government\r\n\ndismissed the remaining counts charging interference with the\r\n\nrights  of the  two  other  men,  and use  of  a  firearm  in\r\n\nconnection with a crime of violence.\r\n\n          Defendants were sentenced July 21, 1995.  The court\r\n\nmade the same sentencing calculations for both defendants, to\r\n\nwhich  neither objected.   Applying  USSG   2H1.3(a)(3),1 the\r\n\ncourt determined that the  underlying offense for both counts\r\n\nII and  IV was  \"aggravated assault,\" having  determined that\r\n\nboth  involved use of \"a  dangerous weapon with  intent to do\r\n\nbodily  harm.\"   See   2A2.2 and  comment.  (n.1).   Allowing\r                                \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Section  2H1.3 has  been  deleted  by consolidation  with\r\n 2H1.1,  effective Nov. 1,  1995, but was  still operative at\r\nthe time of defendants' sentencing.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nenhancements for Luna's injury,  2A2.2(b)(3)(B), discharge of\r\n\na  firearm,   2A2.2(b)(2)(A),  and  obstruction  of  justice,\r\n\n 3C1.1,  it  arrived  at  a combined  offense  level  of  30,\r\n\ndeducted  three for acceptance of responsibility,  3E1.1, for\r\n\na  total  offense  level   of  27.    Page,  with   no  prior\r\n\nconvictions, faced an imprisonment range of 70 to  87 months,\r\n\nand  Adams, who  has a record,  faced 78  to 97  months.  The\r\n\ncourt  imposed  70  months on  Page,  and  88  on Adams,  and\r\n\nassessed each $370 in restitution.\r\n\n          The  bulk of  defendants'  appeal proceeds  on  the\r\n\nmistaken  notion  that  the  aggravated   assault  provision,\r\n\n 2A2.2, applies  only if the victim  suffered \"serious bodily\r\n\ninjury,\"  which  they contend  was  not the  case  for either\r\n\ncount.    Serious bodily  injury,  however,  is only  one  of\r\n\nseveral alternative bases for applying the aggravated assault\r\n\nprovision:\r\n\n          \"Aggravated  assault\"  means a  felonious\r\n          assault  that  involved  (a) a  dangerous\r\n          weapon  with  intent  to do  bodily  harm\r\n          (i.e.,  not merely  to frighten),  or (b)\r                                                           \r\n          serious bodily injury,  or (c) intent  to\r                                                \r\n          commit another felony.\r\n\nUSSG  2A2.2,  comment. (n.1). (Emphasis added.)   Thus simple\r\n\nintent to do bodily harm of  any kind, without regard to  the\r\n\ndegree actually suffered, if  any,2 may support a finding  of\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Under  2A2.2, degree of bodily injury is relevant only to\r\ndetermining  how  many  levels  to  add  --  two for  \"bodily\r\ninjury,\"  four for  \"serious  bodily injury,\"  and three  for\r\nsomething  in between.   See   2A2.2(b)(3).   Defendants also\r                                        \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\naggravated assault  and application  of the far  heftier base\r\n\noffense level  and enhancements  than provided for  under the\r\n\n\"minor assault\"  guideline that defendants  would prefer  the\r\n\ncourt  to apply.   The court  unassailably found  that firing\r\n\nmultiple gunshots at an occupied and moving vehicle \"is bound\r\n\nto result in hitting a tire, gas tank, person, something that\r\n\ncan  only  be  calculated to  end  up  in  bodily harm,\"  and\r\n\ntherefore that  both  counts II  and  IV fit  the  aggravated\r\n\nassault guideline.   Defendants' effort to  void this finding\r\n\nby pointing out that the bullet that actually struck Luna was\r\n\none  that had been aimed at the ground, and simply ricocheted\r\n\nupward into the vehicle, does not advance their claim.\r\n\n          Neither  the  court   nor  the  parties   focussed,\r\n\nhowever, on  2A2.2's additional  requirement that the assault\r\n\nbe  \"felonious.\"  The argument that count II, resulting in no\r\n\ninjury to  Gonzales, is  not \"felonious\"  for the purpose  of\r\n\napplying   2A2.2  was  not  specifically  articulated  to the\r\n\ndistrict court.  Because  we find it was at  least implicitly\r\n\nraised and pursued by  defendants' multiple efforts to attack\r\n\nthe propriety  of  applying   2A2.2  to  count  II,  and  the\r\n\ngovernment addressed the issue  without contending review was\r\n\nforeclosed,   we   reach   it   despite   perhaps   imperfect\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\ndispute  the  court's  addition  of four  levels  under  this\r\nprovision, which we address post.\r                                            \r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\npreservation below.3\r\n\n          Our first question is,  quite simply, what does the\r\n\nguideline mean by \"felonious?\"  Although commentary to  2A2.2\r\n\ndefines a host of terms and phrases, no definition for felony\r\n\nor \"felonious\" is provided or referenced.  Prior to enactment\r\n\nof  the Guidelines  a felony  had long  been defined  as \"any\r\n\noffense  punishable  by  death  or imprisonment  for  a  term\r\n\nexceeding one year.\"  18 U.S.C.   1 (June 25, 1948), repealed\r                                                                         \r\n\nby Sentencing  Reform Act of  1984, Pub.L. 98-473,  Title II,\r              \r\n\n  218(1)(1), 98  Stat. 2027 (repeal effective  Nov. 1, 1987).\r\n\nThe  Guidelines perhaps  obviated the  necessity of    1, but\r\n\nnowhere  refute or replace its felony definition.  In fact, a\r\n\nprovision  unrelated to   2A2.2  defines  a felony  precisely\r\n\naccording to the repealed  statute.  See USSG  4A1.2(o).   An\r                                                    \r\n\nintent to incorporate  this pre-existing definition into  the\r\n\nGuidelines where appropriate thus  seems clear.  We conclude,\r\n\ntherefore,  that  \"felonious,\"  as  used  in   2A2.2,   means\r\n\n\"punishable by  death or a term of imprisonment exceeding one\r\n\nyear.\"\r\n\n          The penalty  provision of   245(b) in  force at the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  We  note  that  if  count  II  cannot  be  considered  an\r\naggravated  assault, defendants' combined offense level would\r\nbe  no  more than  25, yielding  a  guideline range  of 57-71\r\nmonths for Page, and 63-78 for Adams, permitting sentences of\r\nup to 13 and 15 months less than they received, respectively.\r\nCf.  United States  v. Newman,  982 F.2d  665, 672  (1st Cir.\r                                         \r\n1992),  cert. denied,     U.S.    , 114 S.Ct. 59, 126 L.Ed.2d\r                                \r\n28 (1993).\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\ntime of the assaults provided that offenders\r\n\n          shall  be fined not  more than $1,000, or\r\n          imprisoned  not  more than  one  year, or\r\n          both; and if  bodily injury results shall\r\n          be  fined  not  more  than   $10,000,  or\r\n          imprisoned  not more  than ten  years, or\r\n          both;  and  if  death  results  shall  be\r\n          subject  to imprisonment for  any term of\r\n          years or for life.\r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   245(b)  (amended Sept.  13, 1994).   Count II  is\r                                        \r\n\ntherefore felonious  only if  it resulted in  bodily injury.4\r\n\nGonzales himself suffered none,  thus count II qualifies only\r\n\nif Luna's gunshot  wound can  be said to  have resulted  from\r\n\ndefendants' violation of Gonzales'  rights as well as Luna's.\r\n\nAccording to  defendants, the problem with  this is two-fold:\r\n\nit  unjustifiably stretches  the  language  of   245(b)  and,\r\n\nbecause  Luna's  injury  already  sustains  increase  in  the\r\n\napplicable  punishment  for  count  IV,  runs  afoul  of  the\r\n\nprohibition on  multiple punishments contained  in the double\r\n\njeopardy clause of the Constitution.\r\n\n          We  find  nothing  in  the  statutory  language  to\r\n\nsupport reading  the penalty provision of    245(b) to permit\r\n\nenhancement only  in cases of  bodily injury to  the intended\r\n\nvictim  of the  particular  offense.   Nor is  there anything\r\n\nindicating  an intent  to restrict  penalty enhancement  to a\r\n\nsingle   count  when   multiple   counts  aimed   at  several\r\n                    \r                                \r\nindividuals  end  up  causing  but a  single  bodily  injury.\r\n4.  There  is   no  question  that   Luna's  injury  supports\r\nenhancement for count IV.\r            First,  it is plain from  the structure of    245(b) that the\r\n\n5.  The Senate  Judiciary Committee Report on  the history of\r            penalty enhancement applies to  each and every listed offense\r\nthe  bill   explained  the  graduated  penalty  provision  as\r\nfollows:\r            that \"results\"  in bodily  injury, regardless of  whether the\r\n\n          If no  one is actually  harmed, penalties\r                                \r            victim  of  the  particular  offense was  the  one  injured.5\r\n          are limited  to a $1,000 fine  and 1 year\r\n          imprisonment;  if bodily  injury results,\r\n          the maximum penalties  are a $10,000 fine\r\n          and  10 years imprisonment;  and if death\r\n          results . . . \r\n\nS.  Rep.  No.  721, 90th  Cong.,  2d  Sess.  (Nov. 2,  1967),\r\nreprinted in 1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1837, 1846.  (Emphasis added.)\r                        \r\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\nSecond, the unqualified  phrase, \"if bodily injury  results,\"\r\n\nunambiguously signifies  that there  is no safe  haven for  a\r\n\nperpetrator of  aggravated assault against  many that happens\r\n\nto result in bodily injury only to one.  Cf. United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nBass, 404 U.S.  336, 347-48 (1971).  The court found that the\r                \r\n\noffense behavior underlying both  counts included two bullets\r\n\naimed  directly at the car  -- that only  Luna was physically\r\n\ninjured is  immaterial to the conclusion  that the violations\r\n\nof both  Luna's and Gonzales' civil rights each \"resulted\" in\r                               \r\n\nthe bodily  injury sustained  by Luna, rendering  both counts\r\n\nsubject to penalty  enhancement under   245(b).

We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to pre-sentence reports accepted by the court, in the early hours of September 19, 1992, Adams accosted Ruben Gonzales, Oscar Luna and Emiliano Valenzuela as they attempted to enter a convenience store, calling them \"f______ Mexicans\" who should go back to Mexico where they \"belonged,\" and offering to send them back in a body bag.   Page joined Adams, who grabbed Page's handgun from inside his truck, stuck it to Gonzales' temple and threatened to \"blow his head off.\"   An employee called the police, whereupon Gonzales and his companions drove off with a fourth friend who had remained in their car.   Page jumped in his truck and followed, with Adams in the passenger seat and the gun between them, and two cohorts riding in back.   Two other carloads of their friends joined the chase.   Driving about 75 miles an hour, Page pulled up behind Gonzales' car, fired seven shots into the air, and at Adams' urging, two more directly into the back of the vehicle and two at the ground behind it.   One bullet struck Luna in the arm, another lodged in the headrest behind Gonzales' head.   Page then slowed and turned back.   Luna was taken to a hospital shortly, treated for a gunshot wound to his right upper arm and released approximately 90 minutes later.   He lost use of his arm and was unable to work for three weeks, and continued to suffer residual pain for some time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to a plea agreement, Adams and Page each pled guilty to conspiracy to hinder others in the free exercise of federally secured rights, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 241 (count I), racially motivated interference with Gonzales' use of a public accommodation, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 245(b)(2)(F) and 2 (count II), and interference with Luna's use of same, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 245(b)(4)(A) and 2 (count IV).   In return, the government dismissed the remaining counts charging interference with the rights of the two other men, and use of a firearm in connection with a crime of violence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants were sentenced July 21, 1995.   The court made the same sentencing calculations for both defendants, to which neither objected.   Applying USSG &#167; 2H1.3(a)(3),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> the court determined that the underlying offense for both counts II and IV was \"aggravated assault,\" having determined that both involved use of \"a dangerous weapon with intent to do bodily harm.\"   See &#167; 2A2.2 and comment.  (n.1).   Allowing enhancements for Luna's injury, &#167; 2A2.2(b)(3)(B), discharge of a firearm, &#167; 2A2.2(b)(2)(A), and obstruction of justice, &#167; 3C1.1, it arrived at a combined offense level of 30, deducted three for acceptance of responsibility, &#167; 3E1.1, for a total offense level of 27.   Page, with no prior convictions, faced an imprisonment range of 70 to 87 months, and Adams, who has a record, faced 78 to 97 months.   The court imposed 70 months on Page, and 88 on Adams, and assessed each $370 in restitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bulk of defendants' appeal proceeds on the mistaken notion that the aggravated assault provision, &#167; 2A2.2, applies only if the victim suffered \"serious bodily injury,\" which they contend was not the case for either count.   Serious bodily injury, however, is only one of several alternative bases for applying the aggravated assault provision:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>\"Aggravated assault\" means a felonious assault that involved (a) a dangerous weapon with intent to do bodily harm (i.e., not merely to frighten), or (b) serious bodily injury, or (c) intent to commit another felony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">USSG &#167; 2A2.2, comment.  (n.1).  (Emphasis added.)   Thus simple intent to do bodily harm of any kind, without regard to the degree actually suffered, if any,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> may support a finding of aggravated assault and application of the far heftier base offense level and enhancements than provided for under the \"minor assault\" guideline that defendants would prefer the court to apply.   The court unassailably found that firing multiple gunshots at an occupied and moving vehicle \"is bound to result in hitting a tire, gas tank, person, something that can only be calculated to end up in bodily harm,\" and therefore that both counts II and IV fit the aggravated assault guideline.   Defendants' effort to void this finding by pointing out that the bullet that actually struck Luna was one that had been aimed at the ground, and simply ricocheted upward into the vehicle, does not advance their claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither the court nor the parties focussed, however, on &#167; 2A2.2's additional requirement that the assault be \"felonious.\"   The argument that count II, resulting in no injury to Gonzales, is not \"felonious\" for the purpose of applying &#167; 2A2.2 was not specifically articulated to the district court.   Because we find it was at least implicitly raised and pursued by defendants' multiple efforts to attack the propriety of applying &#167; 2A2.2 to count II, and the government addressed the issue without contending review was foreclosed, we reach it despite perhaps imperfect preservation below.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our first question is, quite simply, what does the guideline mean by \"felonious?\"   Although commentary to &#167; 2A2.2 defines a host of terms and phrases, no definition for felony or \"felonious\" is provided or referenced.   Prior to enactment of the Guidelines a felony had long been defined as \"any offense punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 1 (June 25, 1948), repealed by Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Pub.L. 98-473, Title II, &#167; 218(1)(1), 98 Stat. 2027 (repeal effective Nov. 1, 1987).   The Guidelines perhaps obviated the necessity of &#167; 1, but nowhere refute or replace its felony definition.   In fact, a provision unrelated to &#167; 2A2.2 defines a felony precisely according to the repealed statute.   See USSG &#167; 4A1.2(o).   An intent to incorporate this pre-existing definition into the Guidelines where appropriate thus seems clear.   We conclude, therefore, that \"felonious,\" as used in &#167; 2A2.2, means \"punishable by death or a term of imprisonment exceeding one year.\"The penalty provision of &#167; 245(b) in force at the time of the assaults provided that offenders</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>shall be fined not more than $1,000, or imprisoned not more than one year, or both;  and if bodily injury results shall be fined not more than $10,000, or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both;  and if death results shall be subject to imprisonment for any term of years or for life.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 245(b) (amended Sept. 13, 1994).   Count II is therefore felonious only if it resulted in bodily injury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Gonzales himself suffered none, thus count II qualifies only if Luna's gunshot wound can be said to have resulted from defendants' violation of Gonzales' rights as well as Luna's.   According to defendants, the problem with this is two-fold:  it unjustifiably stretches the language of &#167; 245(b) and, because Luna's injury already sustains increase in the applicable punishment for count IV, runs afoul of the prohibition on multiple punishments contained in the double jeopardy clause of the Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find nothing in the statutory language to support reading the penalty provision of &#167; 245(b) to permit enhancement only in cases of bodily injury to the intended victim of the particular offense.   Nor is there anything indicating an intent to restrict penalty enhancement to a single count when multiple counts aimed at several individuals end up causing but a single bodily injury.   First, it is plain from the structure of &#167; 245(b) that the penalty enhancement applies to each and every listed offense that \"results\" in bodily injury, regardless of whether the victim of the particular offense was the one injured.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Second, the unqualified phrase, \"if bodily injury results,\" unambiguously signifies that there is no safe haven for a perpetrator of aggravated assault against many that happens to result in bodily injury only to one.   Cf. United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 347-48, 92 S.Ct. 515, 522-23, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971).   The court found that the offense behavior underlying both counts included two bullets aimed directly at the car--that only Luna was physically injured is immaterial to the conclusion that the violations of both Luna's and Gonzales' civil rights each \"resulted\" in the bodily injury sustained by Luna, rendering both counts subject to penalty enhancement under &#167; 245(b).   Count II is therefore \"felonious\" for the purpose of applying USSG &#167; 2A2.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants' claim that this reading unconstitutionally subjects them to multiple punishments for the same offense is also unavailing.   There is no question that the offenses in sub-sections (2)(F) and (4)(A) of &#167; 245(b), at least when committed against different individuals, describe discrete and separately punishable crimes, with higher sentences authorized for each offense resulting in bodily injury (or death).   The multiple punishments prohibition of the double jeopardy clause \"merely prohibits a sentencing court from imposing a stiffer punishment than the legislature intended.\"  Catala Fonfrias v. United States, 951 F.2d 423, 425-426 (1st Cir.1991) (citing Missouri v. Hunter, 459 U.S. 359, 366, 103 S.Ct. 673, 678, 74 L.Ed.2d 535 (1983)), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 834, 113 S.Ct. 105, 121 L.Ed.2d 64 (1992).   In Fonfrias, relying on both text and legislative history, we held that a penalty provision identical to &#167; 245(b)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> clearly contemplated that a single \"result\" could be the consequence of more than one covered crime, and consequently upheld imposition of two consecutive life sentences for a single death resulting from defendant's commission of two separate offenses.  Id. at 426.   So, here, Luna's injury, the result of two separate offenses, can support penalty enhancement for each without raising double jeopardy concerns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants next complain of the court's refusal to group all three counts together, which would have saved them at least a two-level increase, see &#167; 3D1.4, but we are unable to discern anything out of step in the court's rote application of the grouping guideline.   See USSG &#167; 3D1.2 and comment.  (n.5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants also attack the court's finding that Luna's wound was a \"serious bodily injury,\" which added four to the offense level for count IV.  See &#167; 2A2.2(b)(3)(B).   Adams asserts, first, error of law in the court's use of the Guideline definition, because it does not follow Congress' language used to define crimes and set minimum or maximum sentences.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  There is no reason why the Guidelines may not make their own classifications within the statutes, and hence definitions which the courts must observe, so long as these are not internally inconsistent or in violation of the Constitution or a federal statute.   See Stinson v. United States, 508 U.S. 36, 38, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 1915, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993).   We see no such problem here.   Second, both defendants claim clear error in the court's factual determination that a bullet wound to the upper arm which took the victim to the hospital (90 minutes) and left him work-disabled for three weeks \"constitute[d] the impairment of a function of a bodily member,\" thereby falling within the Guideline definition of what is serious.   To impair, generally, means to diminish or decrease.   There is no requirement of duration, nor does the Guideline definition impose one with respect to this or any of the other examples given.

They now object to virtually every step of the court's application of the Sentencing Guidelines and underlying statutes to their offenses.   We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to pre-sentence reports accepted by the court, in the early hours of September 19, 1992, Adams accosted Ruben Gonzales, Oscar Luna and Emiliano Valenzuela as they attempted to enter a convenience store, calling them \"f______ Mexicans\" who should go back to Mexico where they \"belonged,\" and offering to send them back in a body bag.   Page joined Adams, who grabbed Page's handgun from inside his truck, stuck it to Gonzales' temple and threatened to \"blow his head off.\"   An employee called the police, whereupon Gonzales and his companions drove off with a fourth friend who had remained in their car.   Page jumped in his truck and followed, with Adams in the passenger seat and the gun between them, and two cohorts riding in back.   Two other carloads of their friends joined the chase.   Driving about 75 miles an hour, Page pulled up behind Gonzales' car, fired seven shots into the air, and at Adams' urging, two more directly into the back of the vehicle and two at the ground behind it.   One bullet struck Luna in the arm, another lodged in the headrest behind Gonzales' head.   Page then slowed and turned back.   Luna was taken to a hospital shortly, treated for a gunshot wound to his right upper arm and released approximately 90 minutes later.   He lost use of his arm and was unable to work for three weeks, and continued to suffer residual pain for some time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to a plea agreement, Adams and Page each pled guilty to conspiracy to hinder others in the free exercise of federally secured rights, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 241 (count I), racially motivated interference with Gonzales' use of a public accommodation, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 245(b)(2)(F) and 2 (count II), and interference with Luna's use of same, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 245(b)(4)(A) and 2 (count IV).   In return, the government dismissed the remaining counts charging interference with the rights of the two other men, and use of a firearm in connection with a crime of violence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants were sentenced July 21, 1995.   The court made the same sentencing calculations for both defendants, to which neither objected.   Applying USSG &#167; 2H1.3(a)(3),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> the court determined that the underlying offense for both counts II and IV was \"aggravated assault,\" having determined that both involved use of \"a dangerous weapon with intent to do bodily harm.\"   See &#167; 2A2.2 and comment.  (n.1).   Allowing enhancements for Luna's injury, &#167; 2A2.2(b)(3)(B), discharge of a firearm, &#167; 2A2.2(b)(2)(A), and obstruction of justice, &#167; 3C1.1, it arrived at a combined offense level of 30, deducted three for acceptance of responsibility, &#167; 3E1.1, for a total offense level of 27.   Page, with no prior convictions, faced an imprisonment range of 70 to 87 months, and Adams, who has a record, faced 78 to 97 months.   The court imposed 70 months on Page, and 88 on Adams, and assessed each $370 in restitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bulk of defendants' appeal proceeds on the mistaken notion that the aggravated assault provision, &#167; 2A2.2, applies only if the victim suffered \"serious bodily injury,\" which they contend was not the case for either count.   Serious bodily injury, however, is only one of several alternative bases for applying the aggravated assault provision:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>\"Aggravated assault\" means a felonious assault that involved (a) a dangerous weapon with intent to do bodily harm (i.e., not merely to frighten), or (b) serious bodily injury, or (c) intent to commit another felony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">USSG &#167; 2A2.2, comment.  (n.1).  (Emphasis added.)   Thus simple intent to do bodily harm of any kind, without regard to the degree actually suffered, if any,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> may support a finding of aggravated assault and application of the far heftier base offense level and enhancements than provided for under the \"minor assault\" guideline that defendants would prefer the court to apply.   The court unassailably found that firing multiple gunshots at an occupied and moving vehicle \"is bound to result in hitting a tire, gas tank, person, something that can only be calculated to end up in bodily harm,\" and therefore that both counts II and IV fit the aggravated assault guideline.   Defendants' effort to void this finding by pointing out that the bullet that actually struck Luna was one that had been aimed at the ground, and simply ricocheted upward into the vehicle, does not advance their claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither the court nor the parties focussed, however, on &#167; 2A2.2's additional requirement that the assault be \"felonious.\"   The argument that count II, resulting in no injury to Gonzales, is not \"felonious\" for the purpose of applying &#167; 2A2.2 was not specifically articulated to the district court.   Because we find it was at least implicitly raised and pursued by defendants' multiple efforts to attack the propriety of applying &#167; 2A2.2 to count II, and the government addressed the issue without contending review was foreclosed, we reach it despite perhaps imperfect preservation below.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our first question is, quite simply, what does the guideline mean by \"felonious?\"   Although commentary to &#167; 2A2.2 defines a host of terms and phrases, no definition for felony or \"felonious\" is provided or referenced.   Prior to enactment of the Guidelines a felony had long been defined as \"any offense punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 1 (June 25, 1948), repealed by Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Pub.L. 98-473, Title II, &#167; 218(1)(1), 98 Stat. 2027 (repeal effective Nov. 1, 1987).   The Guidelines perhaps obviated the necessity of &#167; 1, but nowhere refute or replace its felony definition.   In fact, a provision unrelated to &#167; 2A2.2 defines a felony precisely according to the repealed statute.   See USSG &#167; 4A1.2(o).   An intent to incorporate this pre-existing definition into the Guidelines where appropriate thus seems clear.   We conclude, therefore, that \"felonious,\" as used in &#167; 2A2.2, means \"punishable by death or a term of imprisonment exceeding one year.\"The penalty provision of &#167; 245(b) in force at the time of the assaults provided that offenders</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>shall be fined not more than $1,000, or imprisoned not more than one year, or both;  and if bodily injury results shall be fined not more than $10,000, or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both;  and if death results shall be subject to imprisonment for any term of years or for life.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 245(b) (amended Sept. 13, 1994).   Count II is therefore felonious only if it resulted in bodily injury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Gonzales himself suffered none, thus count II qualifies only if Luna's gunshot wound can be said to have resulted from defendants' violation of Gonzales' rights as well as Luna's.   According to defendants, the problem with this is two-fold:  it unjustifiably stretches the language of &#167; 245(b) and, because Luna's injury already sustains increase in the applicable punishment for count IV, runs afoul of the prohibition on multiple punishments contained in the double jeopardy clause of the Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find nothing in the statutory language to support reading the penalty provision of &#167; 245(b) to permit enhancement only in cases of bodily injury to the intended victim of the particular offense.   Nor is there anything indicating an intent to restrict penalty enhancement to a single count when multiple counts aimed at several individuals end up causing but a single bodily injury.   First, it is plain from the structure of &#167; 245(b) that the penalty enhancement applies to each and every listed offense that \"results\" in bodily injury, regardless of whether the victim of the particular offense was the one injured.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Second, the unqualified phrase, \"if bodily injury results,\" unambiguously signifies that there is no safe haven for a perpetrator of aggravated assault against many that happens to result in bodily injury only to one.   Cf. United States v. Bass, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108421\"><a href=\"/opinion/108421/united-states-v-bass/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">336</span></a></span>, 347-48, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108421\"><a href=\"/opinion/108421/united-states-v-bass/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">488</span></a></span> (1971).   The court found that the offense behavior underlying both counts included two bullets aimed directly at the car--that only Luna was physically injured is immaterial to the conclusion that the violations of both Luna's and Gonzales' civil rights each \"resulted\" in the bodily injury sustained by Luna, rendering both counts subject to penalty enhancement under &#167; 245(b).   Count II is therefore \"felonious\" for the purpose of applying USSG &#167; 2A2.2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants' claim that this reading unconstitutionally subjects them to multiple punishments for the same offense is also unavailing.   There is no question that the offenses in sub-sections (2)(F) and (4)(A) of &#167; 245(b), at least when committed against different individuals, describe discrete and separately punishable crimes, with higher sentences authorized for each offense resulting in bodily injury (or death).   The multiple punishments prohibition of the double jeopardy clause \"merely prohibits a sentencing court from imposing a stiffer punishment than the legislature intended.\"  Catala Fonfrias v.

In Fonfrias, relying on both text and legislative history, we held that a penalty provision identical to &#167; 245(b)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> clearly contemplated that a single \"result\" could be the consequence of more than one covered crime, and consequently upheld imposition of two consecutive life sentences for a single death resulting from defendant's commission of two separate offenses.  Id. at 426.   So, here, Luna's injury, the result of two separate offenses, can support penalty enhancement for each without raising double jeopardy concerns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants next complain of the court's refusal to group all three counts together, which would have saved them at least a two-level increase, see &#167; 3D1.4, but we are unable to discern anything out of step in the court's rote application of the grouping guideline.   See USSG &#167; 3D1.2 and comment.

See &#167; 2A2.2(b)(3)(B).   Adams asserts, first, error of law in the court's use of the Guideline definition, because it does not follow Congress' language used to define crimes and set minimum or maximum sentences.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  There is no reason why the Guidelines may not make their own classifications within the statutes, and hence definitions which the courts must observe, so long as these are not internally inconsistent or in violation of the Constitution or a federal statute.   See Stinson v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112854\"><a href=\"/opinion/112854/stinson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 38, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112854\"><a href=\"/opinion/112854/stinson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Second, both defendants claim clear error in the court's factual determination that a bullet wound to the upper arm which took the victim to the hospital (90 minutes) and left him work-disabled for three weeks \"constitute[d] the impairment of a function of a bodily member,\" thereby falling within the Guideline definition of what is serious.
