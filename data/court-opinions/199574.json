In November, 2000 the National Marine\n\nFisheries Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (collectively,\n\n\"the Services\") issued a final decision designating Atlantic Salmon in\n\nan area comprised of seven Maine rivers to be an endangered species\n\nunder the Endangered Species Act. 16 U.S.C. §§ 1531-1544 (1994 & Supp.\n\nIV 1998). Several weeks later, the State of Maine and business group\n\nplaintiffs sued to have the decision set aside. The United States\n\nappeared to defend the Services.       Several conservation groups,\n\nDefenders of Wildlife, Biodiversity Foundation, Conservation Action\n\nProject, Forest Ecology Network, and Coastal Waters Project\n\n(collectively, \"Defenders\"), sought to intervene also attempting to\n\ndefend the designation of the Atlantic Salmon as an endangered species.\n\nDefenders' chief argument was that the Services had recently been their\n\nadversaries in earlier litigation, which Defenders had brought to force\n\nthe Services to protect the salmon, and this meant the United States\n\ndid not and could not adequately represent the conservation groups'\n\ninterests.   No party opposed the intervention.\n\n          The district court nonetheless denied the intervention, but\n\ndid say it would allow Defenders to participate in the litigation on an\n\namicus-plus status. Maine v. Norton, No. CIV 00-250-B-C, 2001 WL\n\n360991, at *7 (D. Me. Apr. 11, 2001). As amicus-plus, Defenders have\n\nthe right to submit briefs (including arguments not presented by the\n\ngovernment), a limited right to call and cross-examine witnesses, and\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fa right to receive notice and service of all documents and events as if\n\nthey were parties in the case. Defenders appealed from the denial of\n\nintervention. The plaintiff business interests appeared to defend the\n\ndistrict court's order as within its discretion. The State of Maine\n\nhas not taken a position on the appeal.\n\n          With a caveat, we affirm the order as within the trial\n\ncourt's discretion. In doing so, we decline to adopt a per se rule,\n\nurged by Defenders, that the \"inadequacy of representation\" test of\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2) is automatically met where the litigation\n\nchallenges governmental action which the government defends and the\n\nproposed intervenor had earlier sued the government trying to bring\n\nabout a similar action. Rather, the \"inadequacy\" test must be looked\n\nat in context of the facts of the specific case. That context leads to\n\nthe caveat: should, in the course of this litigation, the trial court\n\nconclude that the government appears not to represent adequately the\n\ninterest of Defenders, then it should reconsider afresh, on\n\napplication, the matter of intervention.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          Legend has it that salmon were once so plentiful in the great\n\nrivers of Maine that workers along the Kennebec River negotiated as a\n\nterm of employment that they would not be fed salmon for breakfast,\n\nlunch, and dinner. W.H. Bunting, A Day's Work (2000). In the year\n\n2000, by contrast, very few wild adult salmon returned to the seven\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fMaine Rivers at issue in this case (the Dennys, East Machias, Machias,\n\nPleasant, Narraguagus, Ducktrap, and Sheepscot Rivers). Me. Atl.\n\nSalmon     Comm'n,     2000      Trap     Catch     Statistics,      at\n\nhttp://www.state.me.us/asa/2000catchstats.html (last modified Nov. 3,\n\n2000). This is significant because the Atlantic Salmon spawns in\n\nfreshwater rivers. Young salmon live in those rivers for one to three\n\nyears before they undergo changes which enable them to live in\n\nsaltwater.   The salmon then migrate to the Atlantic Ocean.          In\n\nreproducing, they return to the streams where they were born, where the\n\nfemale salmon delivers the eggs.\n\n           Concerned about the decline in salmon population, in 1993 one\n\nof the conservation groups petitioned the Services to list the salmon\n\nas an \"endangered\" species under the Endangered Species Act (\"ESA\").\n\nSee 16 U.S.C. § 1540(g)(2)(C) (requiring written notice); 65 Fed. Reg.\n\n69,459 at 69,462 (2000) (providing a history of previous federal action\n\nconcerning the salmon).\n\n           \"Endangered species\" is a legal term of art that signifies\n\n\"any species which is in danger of extinction throughout all or a\n\nsignificant portion of its range.\"       16 U.S.C. § 1532(6).     It is\n\ncontrasted with \"threatened species,\" which signifies \"any species\n\nwhich is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable\n\nfuture.\"   Id. § 1532(20).    The ESA requires the Secretary of the\n\nInterior to \"determine whether any species is an endangered species or\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fa threatened species because of any of the following factors: (A) the\n\npresent or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its\n\nhabitat or range; (B) overutilization for commercial, recreational,\n\nscientific, or educational purposes; (C) disease or predation; (D) the\n\ninadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; or (E) other natural or\n\nmanmade factors affecting its continued existence.\" Id. § 1533(a)(1).\n\nThe Secretary must classify species as endangered or threatened \"solely\n\non the basis of the best scientific and commercial data available to\n\nhim after conducting a review of the status of the species and after\n\ntaking into account those efforts, if any, being made by any State . .\n\n. to protect such species.\"      Id. § 1533(b)(1)(A).\n\n          The purpose of such classification is to conserve the\n\nendangered or threatened species. See id. § 1531(b). But there are\n\ndifferences between the two classifications. While the ESA requires\n\nthe Secretary to issue regulations to provide for the conservation of\n\nthreatened species, id. § 1533(d), it also prohibits the import,\n\nexport, or taking of endangered species, id. § 1538(a)(1). When making\n\neither the \"threatened\" or \"endangered\" determination, the Secretary\n\nmust take state efforts to protect the species into account. Id. §\n\n1533(b)(1)(A). If the Secretary enters into a cooperative agreement\n\nwith a state to protect a threatened species, regulations to protect\n\nthat species, with the exception of regulations prohibiting the taking\n\nof that species, apply only to the extent that the state has adopted\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fthem.    Id. § 1533(d).\n\n           This legislative framework sets the stage for the regulatory\n\nhistory, which is essential to understanding Defenders' argument.\n\n                                 II.\n\n           In 1994, in response to the 1993 petition to list the\n\nAtlantic Salmon under the ESA, the Services published a notice in the\n\nFederal Register indicating that such a listing was potentially\n\nwarranted. 59 Fed. Reg. 3067 (1994). In 1995, the Services concluded\n\nthat the requested listing was not warranted because the salmon as they\n\nhad been described in the earlier petition did not meet the ESA's\n\ndefinition of a species. 60 Fed. Reg. 14,410 (1995).1 In this same\n\nnotice, the Services concluded that the Atlantic Salmon in seven Maine\n\nrivers did meet the ESA's criteria for a species because they were\n\nfound to be evolutionarily significant and reproductively isolated from\n\nother populations belonging to the same species.        Id. at 14,411-12.\n\n           In 1995, the Services published a proposed rule listing the\n\nGulf of Maine Distinct Population Segment (\"DPS\") of the Atlantic\n\nSalmon as threatened under the ESA. 60 Fed. Reg. 50,530 (1995). But\n\nin 1997, the Services withdrew the proposed rule because of scientific\n\ndata bearing on the health of the DPS and ongoing and planned actions\n\n     1    The 1993 petition requested the Services to list the\nnaturally spawning anadromous Atlantic Salmon throughout its known\nhistoric range in the United States. The Services \"determined that\navailable biological evidence\" did not support such a listing. 60 Fed.\nReg. at 14,412.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fto protect the Atlantic Salmon, including federal conservation efforts\n\nand the State of Maine's development of the \"Atlantic Salmon\n\nConservation Plan for Seven Maine Rivers.\" 62 Fed. Reg. 66,325 at\n\n66,332-37 (1997).\n\n          Maine's Conservation Plan addresses both ongoing and proposed\n\nactions to reduce threats to the Atlantic Salmon. Id. at 66,335. \"The\n\nstated intent of the Conservation Plan is to minimize human impacts on\n\nthe Atlantic salmon and restore the species . . . .\" Id. The Maine\n\nPlan identifies five categories of threats to the salmon: agriculture,\n\naquaculture, forestry, recreational fishing, and other natural and\n\nhuman related threats. Id. at 66,335-37. For each category of threat,\n\nthe Plan describes ongoing and planned future actions to protect the\n\nsalmon.   Id.\n\n          When deciding whether to classify a species as threatened or\n\nendangered under the ESA, the Secretary must consider the status of the\n\nspecies after accounting for any state efforts to protect the species.\n\n16 U.S.C. § 1533(b)(1)(A).     After doing so, the Services in 1997\n\nconcluded that ongoing actions had \"substantially reduced threats to\n\nthe species\" and that the DPS was \"not likely to become endangered in\n\nthe foreseeable future\" and so listing was \"not warranted\" at the time.\n\n62 Fed. Reg. 66,325 at 66,337.\n\n          In 1999, the proposed intervenors filed suit in the U.S.\n\nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia, challenging the Services'\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f1997 withdrawal of the proposed rule. While the D.C. litigation was\n\nunderway, the Services in November 1999 proposed a new rule that listed\n\nthe Gulf of Maine Salmon as endangered, 64 Fed. Reg. 62,627 (1999), not\n\nmerely threatened. Once a proposed listing rule is promulgated, the\n\nServices ordinarily have one year to make a final decision. 16 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1533(b)(6)(A)(i).\n\n          On June 14, 2000, the parties in the D.C. litigation entered\n\ninto a court-endorsed stipulation agreeing to stay that litigation\n\npending the Services' decision to promulgate or withdraw the proposed\n\nendangered species rule by November 17, 2000.        In entering the\n\nstipulation, the Services were modifying their unilateral ability to\n\nextend the review process by six months, see 16 U.S.C. § 1533(b)(6)(B).\n\nThe stipulation did provide that a party could ask the court to modify\n\nthe terms of the agreement. Eventually, the D.C. litigation concluded\n\nand judgment entered. The Services complied with the stipulation by\n\ndeciding within the stipulated time frame of one year.\n\n          The Services issued a final rule listing the Gulf of Maine\n\nAtlantic Salmon as an endangered species. 65 Fed. Reg. 69,459 (2000)\n\n(to be codified at 50 C.F.R. pts. 17 and 224). In their justification\n\nfor listing the Atlantic Salmon as endangered, the Services considered,\n\namong other factors, the low number of returning adult salmon, 65 Fed.\n\nReg. 69,459 at 69,461, 69,479, the escalating threat of disease, id. at\n\n69,476-77, and threats to the salmon from existing aquaculture\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fpractices, id. at 69,477-79.\n\n          The State of Maine, the Maine State Chamber of Commerce, and\n\nvarious Maine businesses and business associations challenged the\n\nregulation. They alleged, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure\n\nAct, that the Services' designation of the Maine Atlantic Salmon as\n\nendangered was arbitrary and capricious and should therefore be set\n\naside. See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) (1994). Their complaint included\n\nallegations that the Services (1) failed to base their listing decision\n\non the best available data; (2) ignored Maine's Plan to protect and\n\nrestore the salmon; (3) unlawfully agreed to restrict their own ability\n\nto extend the statutory deadline for regulating; and (4) acted\n\ninconsistently with their prior decision not to list the salmon as\n\nthreatened or endangered.\n\n                                 III.\n\n          We start with Defenders' challenge to the district court's\n\ndenial of their motion for intervention of right. Intervention of\n\nright, in the absence of a federal statute granting intervention, is\n\ngoverned by Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2), which states:\n\n          Upon timely application anyone shall be permitted to\n          intervene in an action: . . . (2) when the applicant claims\n          an interest relating to the property or transaction which is\n          the subject of the action and the applicant is so situated\n          that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter\n          impair or impede the applicant's ability to protect that\n          interest, unless the applicant's interest is adequately\n          represented by existing parties.\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fThis suit largely turns2 on the clause \"unless the applicant's interest\n\nis adequately represented by existing parties.\"\n\n          The appellate standard of review in this Circuit is that\n\n\"[w]e will reverse the denial of a motion to intervene as of right 'if\n\nthe court fails to apply the general standard provided by the text of\n\nRule 24(a)(2), or if the court reaches a decision that so fails to\n\ncomport with the standard as to indicate an abuse of discretion.'\"\n\nPublic Serv. Co. of N.H. v. Patch, 136 F.3d 197, 204 (1st Cir. 1998)\n\n(quoting International Paper Co. v. Town of Jay, 887 F.2d 338, 344 (1st\n\nCir. 1989)). As we have said, \"'abuse of discretion' . . . may be a\n\nmisleading phrase. Decisions on abstract issues of law are always\n\nreviewed de novo; and the extent of deference on 'law application'\n\nissues tends to vary with the circumstances.\" Cotter v. Mass. Ass'n of\n\nMinority Law Enforcement Officers, 219 F.3d 31, 34 (1st Cir. 2000),\n\ncert. denied, 531 U.S. 1072 (2001).      \"Despite its nomenclature,\n\nintervention 'as of right' usually turns on judgment calls and fact\n\nassessments that a reviewing court is unlikely to disturb except for\n\nclear mistakes. . . . [I]n practice, the district court enjoys a\n\nreasonable measure of latitude . . . .\"        Daggett v. Comm'n on\n\n\n\n     2    The district court assumed that Defenders' asserted interest\nsatisfied Rule 24(a)(2)'s \"interest relating to the property or\ntransaction which is the subject of the action\" requirement, and held\nthat the disposition of the case may impede Defenders' ability to\nprotect that interest. The business interests' protests need not be\naddressed. Our decision focuses on the \"inadequacy\" point.\n\n                                 -11-\n\fGovernmental Ethics and Election Practices, 172 F.3d 104, 113 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).3\n\n          Some burden of showing inadequacy is placed on the proposed\n\nintervenor. See id. at 111 (not deciding whether burden is one of\n\nproduction or persuasion). The general alignment of interest of the\n\nServices and Defenders in upholding the designation is self-evident.\n\nThis case is not an instance of the government having to make a\n\nregulatory choice which may be adverse to the proposed intervenors; the\n\ngovernment has made the choice to designate the species as endangered,\n\nand the result is what the proposed intervenors wanted. There is no\n\ninadequacy immediately apparent in such a situation.\n\n          Defenders make two arguments as to intervention of right,\n\nonly one of which has any substance. The primary argument is that the\n\nServices, formerly Defenders' antagonists, cannot be trusted to defend\n\nfully the endangered species designation because they will not make an\n\nargument which Defenders would make. The argument the Services are\n\nunlikely to make is that the Services should have protected the\n\nAtlantic Salmon earlier, that they were wrong when they failed to do\n\n\n\n     3     Other circuits, but not this one, apparently review de novo\nmost issues of denial to intervene. E.g., Mausolf v. Babbitt, 85 F.3d\n1295, 1302 (8th Cir. 1996) (reviewing de novo); Coalition of Ariz./N.M.\nCounties for Stable Econ. Growth v. Dep't of the Interior, 100 F.3d\n837, 840 (10th Cir. 1996) (reviewing de novo save for timeliness\nissue); Idaho Farm Bureau Fed'n v. Babbitt, 58 F.3d 1392, 1397 (9th\nCir. 1995) (same); but see In re Sierra Club, 945 F.2d 776, 779 (4th\nCir. 1991) (abuse of discretion review).\n\n                                 -12-\n\fso, particularly in deferring to Maine's State Plan in 1997, and that\n\nthe 2000 designation corrected an earlier mistake. Indeed, the issue\n\non which Defenders focus is in the case as a result of plaintiffs'\n\npleading.    Plaintiffs' complaints claim that the change in the\n\ngovernment's position between 1997 and 2000 is evidence of the\n\narbitrariness of the Services' 2000 designation. More specifically,\n\nDefenders say that the argument they would make is different in kind\n\nfrom the other arguments because it is an argument under step one of\n\nChevron that as a matter of law, the Services could not in 1997 have\n\ndeferred to the Maine Conservation Plan. See Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v.\n\nNatural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984).\n\nThat is because, in their view, that Plan was not an \"existing\"\n\nregulatory mechanism under 16 U.S.C. § 1533(a)(1)(D).\n\n            The Services, having not opposed intervention below, have not\n\nappeared in this appeal, but we assume that they are not likely to\n\nconfess any error as to the 1997 withdrawal of the \"threatened\" species\n\ndesignation. Rather, they will likely say that the sum of information\n\navailable to them justified the 2000 designation.\n\n            Defenders argue that the Supreme Court has said that\n\napplicants for intervention need only make a \"minimal\" showing that\n\nrepresentation \"may be\" inadequate. Trbovich v. United Mine Workers,\n\n404 U.S. 528, 538 n.10 (1972). From this Defenders make a stab at an\n\nargument that the district court made an error of law, reviewed de\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\fnovo, by holding them to the test of demonstrating that the Services\n\n\"will fail to adequately protect their claimed interest.\" Norton, 2001\n\nWL 360991 at *6. \"Will fail,\" they say, is a harsher standard than\n\n\"may be inadequate.\" This argument, which relies on a single phrase\n\nplucked out of a lengthy opinion, is not a fair reading of what the\n\ndistrict court did. The court applied Trbovich and this Circuit's law\n\nand there is no serious argument that the court misapprehended the\n\nlegal standard in its careful analysis. In addition, this case is\n\nmeaningfully different from Trbovich. In Trbovich, the Court's doubts\n\nabout the adequacy of the government's representation stemmed from the\n\nLabor Secretary's statutory duty to represent the \"two distinct\n\ninterests\" of the individual union members and the general public. 404\n\nU.S. at 538-39. Here there is no statutorily imposed conflict and the\n\nServices' interests are closely aligned with Defenders' interests.\n\n          This case presents a recurring situation: a group with\n\nrecognized interests wishes to intervene and defend an action of the\n\ngovernment which the government is itself defending. Trbovich is such\n\na case, as are several of our decisions in the area. E.g., Cotter, 219\n\nF.3d 31 (minority police officers and Massachusetts Association of\n\nMinority Law Enforcement Officers sought to intervene to defend police\n\ndepartment's promotion of minority officers); Mass. Food Ass'n v. Mass.\n\nAlcoholic Beverages Control Comm'n, 197 F.3d 560 (1st Cir. 1999) (trade\n\nassociations sought to intervene to defend Massachusetts liquor\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\fregulation), cert. denied, 529 U.S. 1105 (2000); Daggett, 172 F.3d 104\n\n(parties intending to run for office sought to intervene to defend\n\nMaine Clean Election Act); Patch, 136 F.3d 197 (industry and consumer\n\ngroups sought to intervene to defend New Hampshire electric utility\n\nrestructuring plan); United Nuclear Corp. v. Cannon, 696 F.2d 141 (1st\n\nCir. 1982) (Conservation Law Foundation sought to intervene to defend\n\nRhode Island nuclear power regulation).\n\n          Generally, our decisions have proceeded on the assumption,\n\nsubject to evidence to the contrary, that the government will\n\nadequately defend its actions, at least where its interests appear to\n\nbe aligned with those of the proposed intervenor. E.g., Mass. Food\n\nAss'n, 197 F.3d at 567.     Indeed, our cases use the language of\n\n\"presumption.\"     E.g., id. at 566-67; Daggett, 172 F.3d at 111.\n\nAlthough the bar is raised higher for proposed intervenors in this\n\nsituation, there is danger in a mechanistic application of such\n\nlanguage. \"Presumption\" means no more in this context than calling for\n\nan adequate explanation as to why what is assumed -- here, adequate\n\nrepresentation -- is not so. See Fed. R. Evid. 301; 2 McCormick on\n\nEvidence § 344 at 445-46 (John W. Strong et al. eds., 5th ed. 1999).\n\nThe facts of these cases vary greatly and whether the proposed\n\nintervenors' explanation of inadequacy suffices must be determined \"in\n\nkeeping with a commonsense view of the overall litigation.\" Patch,\n\n136 F.3d at 204.\n\n                                -15-\n\f          Here, Defenders have offered an explanation and the question\n\nis whether the district court abused its discretion in concluding that\n\nthe explanation did not presently suffice.        As the case is now\n\nconfigured, we cannot find abuse of discretion. At bottom Defenders\n\nshow one argument which they wish to present and (we assume) the\n\ngovernment does not. The district court has said, through its grant of\n\namicus-plus status, that it will hear the arguments Defenders wish to\n\npresent. At oral argument before our Court, the plaintiff business\n\ninterests have said they will not object to Defenders presenting\n\narguments on the basis that they are not intervenors (and will respond\n\nto the arguments on the merits).     And our cases have said that a\n\ndifference in tactics as to presenting a legal argument does not\n\nnecessarily an inadequacy make.      E.g., Daggett, 172 F.3d at 112.\n\n          The argument Defenders wish to advance may be thought of as\n\na supplement to the defendants' main argument in the case. The main\n\nargument, under the APA, concerns whether the 2000 designation is\n\n\"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in\n\naccordance with law.\" 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). Whether the Services\n\nshould have earlier so designated the salmon may be a building block in\n\nan argument, but is hardly a necessary one to the defense. Defenders'\n\nadditional argument is better thought of as a rejoinder to plaintiffs'\n\nargument that the Services' different result in 2000 than in 1997 is\n\nevidence that the 2000 decision was arbitrary. There are several\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\fobvious, more direct arguments for the government to make in response\n\nin which the Services and Defenders have a common interest, and which\n\ndo not depend on the alternate argument.\n\n          Defenders seek to wrap themselves in decisions of this Court\n\nreversing district court decisions denying intervention. See Cotter,\n\n219 F.3d 31; Conservation Law Found. v. Mosbacher, 966 F.2d 39 (1st\n\nCir. 1992). But in each of those cases the intervenors had direct\n\nprivate interests (in Cotter, 219 F.3d at 34-37, the jobs and\n\npromotions available to black police officers and in Conservation Law\n\nFoundation, 966 F.2d at 44, commercial fishing interests) which the\n\ngovernment had and could have no interest in protecting. Further, in\n\nConservation Law Foundation, the government did not answer or defend\n\nthe case but simply agreed to a consent decree that imposed additional\n\nburdens on and was unacceptable to intervenors. Id. Those situations\n\nare a far cry from this case, which involves no dissimilar interests,\n\nbut only a tactical disagreement.       It is difficult to analyze\n\n\"inadequacy\" without looking at the strength of the interests the\n\nwould-be intervenors present and the tests of inadequacy may vary with\n\nthe strength of the interests. Daggett, 172 F.3d at 111, 113-14.\n\nThese proposed intervenors, like those in Daggett, are more in the\n\nmiddle of the range as to strength of interests, and, as in Daggett, an\n\nappellate court is hard pressed to reverse a district court's decision,\n\neither way it goes.\n\n                                 -17-\n\f          Given plaintiffs' emphasis on the Services' supposed \"change\"\n\nof position, we might view this case differently if the argument\n\nDefenders wish to present depended on introduction of evidence that the\n\nServices would refuse to present.4      But review of federal agency\n\nadministrative actions is usually confined to the record before the\n\nagency. See SEC v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 87-88 (1943). No one\n\nhas suggested that the record of agency action will not permit the\n\nargument to be made that Defenders wish to pursue. And there is no\n\nsuggestion the case requires presentation of evidence only available\n\nthrough Defenders' participation as intervenors.\n\n          This leaves the argument that because of the prior\n\nlitigation, we should question the government's zeal in adequately\n\ndefending the designation.     The Ninth and the Tenth Circuit have\n\nconsidered this, among other factors, in finding inadequacy in such\n\ncircumstances. Idaho Farm Bureau Fed'n v. Babbitt, 58 F.3d 1392, 1398\n\n(9th Cir. 1995); Coalition of Ariz./N.M. Counties for Stable Econ.\n\nGrowth v. Dep't of the Interior, 100 F.3d 837, 845-46 (10th Cir. 1996).\n\nOur view is that the former adversary relationship between the\n\ngovernment and proposed intervenors may raise questions about adequacy,\n\nbut does not alone answer the questions.         An earlier adverse\n\n\n\n     4    Plaintiff business interests informed the district court they\nwish to discover and introduce evidence outside of the record. The\nUnited States has taken the position review is restricted to the\nrecord. We take no position on the matter.\n\n                                 -18-\n\frelationship with the government does not automatically make for a\n\npresent adverse relationship.\n\n          Here, the Services did not designate the Atlantic Salmon as\n\nendangered under litigation compulsion to reach that result, but rather\n\nof their own accord.    Further, the Services' endangered species\n\ndesignation goes beyond what Defenders sought in the earlier\n\nlitigation. After all, Defenders' suit challenged the 1997 withdrawal\n\nof the designation of the Atlantic Salmon as \"threatened,\" a\n\ndesignation which provides less protection. The articulated reasoning\n\nsupporting the Services' 2000 designation cites to new studies and\n\ninformation not available at the time of the earlier litigation. This\n\nfact distinguishes the subject matter of this litigation from the\n\nearlier case.   The prior litigation was not marked by the sort of\n\nconduct from the government that would evidence bad faith.         Cf.\n\nCoalition of Arizona, 100 F.3d at 845-46 (intransigence of government\n\nin prior litigation resolved only after contempt citation); Mausolf, 85\n\nF.3d at 1303-04 (reversing denial of intervention where inadequacy not\n\nbased on \"nebulous and paranoid 'distrust of government,'\" but on a\n\n\"well-documented history\" of government failure to enforce regulations;\n\ngovernment inevitably has to choose among competing interests and\n\ninterests may be adverse to those of proposed intervenor); In re Sierra\n\nClub, 945 F.2d 776, 780 (4th Cir. 1991) (reversing denial of\n\nintervention where interests of government and intervenors diverge at\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fa number of significant points, including remedy). In another case\n\ninvolving different facts, a prior adversary relationship might\n\nsuffice.     Here it does not and there was no abuse of discretion.\n\n            The second argument5 made by Defenders is that they must be\n\nallowed to intervene to protect what they won in their litigation\n\nagainst the government in the District of Columbia. The main purpose\n\nof the argument seems to be to reinforce the antagonism point discussed\n\nabove.     On its own terms the argument is without merit.       As the\n\ndistrict judge correctly and succinctly concluded, all that Defenders\n\nwon was a stipulation that the Services would decide what to do on\n\nlisting the Atlantic Salmon by a particular date. That bargain was\n\nkept, the decision was made, and there is no risk to that completed\n\nbargain in this litigation.6\n\n            As to permissive intervention, appellate review is even more\n\nrestrictive. Daggett, 172 F.3d at 113. The district court denied\n\nintervention because it felt intervention would delay and complicate\n\nmatters.    This was a judgment call for the court.     It applied the\n\n\n     5     In a footnote, Defenders argue that the change of\nadministration also makes the Services' representation inadequate. The\ndistrict court correctly noted that Defenders have not presented \"any\nevidence\" on inadequacy resulting from the new administration. Norton,\n2001 WL 360991 at *6.\n\n     6    Plaintiff business interests also claim that the stipulation\nas to timing forced USFWS into a precipitous and ill-considered\ndecision. There appears to be a perfect alignment of interests between\nUSFWS and Defenders in denying this.\n\n                                  -20-\n\fappropriate standards and we cannot say it was wrong.\n\n          This litigation is at its early stages. Should it appear to\n\nthe district court from some event that the government may not be\n\nadequately representing the interest, advanced by Defenders, that the\n\nAtlantic Salmon remain listed as an endangered species, the court\n\nshould revisit the matter of intervention. See Mass. Food Ass'n, 197\n\nF.3d at 568 (\"[I]f the [government] refused to appeal from a defeat, a\n\nwould-be intervenor could then seek to intervene.\"); cf. Coalition of\n\nAriz., 100 F.3d at 844-45 (intervention allowed after government had\n\nrefused to take procedural steps which would have helped its case).\n\n          Affirmed.    No costs are awarded.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\f",

In November, 2000 the National Marine\n\nFisheries Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (collectively,\n\n\"the Services\") issued a final decision designating Atlantic Salmon in\n\nan area comprised of seven Maine rivers to be an endangered species\n\nunder the Endangered Species Act. 16 U.S.C. §§ 1531-1544 (1994 & Supp.\n\nIV 1998). Several weeks later, the State of Maine and business group\n\nplaintiffs sued to have the decision set aside. The United States\n\nappeared to defend the Services.       Several conservation groups,\n\nDefenders of Wildlife, Biodiversity Foundation, Conservation Action\n\nProject, Forest Ecology Network, and Coastal Waters Project\n\n(collectively, \"Defenders\"), sought to intervene also attempting to\n\ndefend the designation of the Atlantic Salmon as an endangered species.\n\nDefenders' chief argument was that the Services had recently been their\n\nadversaries in earlier litigation, which Defenders had brought to force\n\nthe Services to protect the salmon, and this meant the United States\n\ndid not and could not adequately represent the conservation groups'\n\ninterests.   No party opposed the intervention.\n\n          The district court nonetheless denied the intervention, but\n\ndid say it would allow Defenders to participate in the litigation on an\n\namicus-plus status. Maine v. Norton, No. CIV 00-250-B-C, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2001</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">360991</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7 (D. Me. Apr. 11, 2001). As amicus-plus, Defenders have\n\nthe right to submit briefs (including arguments not presented by the\n\ngovernment), a limited right to call and cross-examine witnesses, and\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fa right to receive notice and service of all documents and events as if\n\nthey were parties in the case. Defenders appealed from the denial of\n\nintervention. The plaintiff business interests appeared to defend the\n\ndistrict court's order as within its discretion. The State of Maine\n\nhas not taken a position on the appeal.\n\n          With a caveat, we affirm the order as within the trial\n\ncourt's discretion. In doing so, we decline to adopt a per se rule,\n\nurged by Defenders, that the \"inadequacy of representation\" test of\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2) is automatically met where the litigation\n\nchallenges governmental action which the government defends and the\n\nproposed intervenor had earlier sued the government trying to bring\n\nabout a similar action. Rather, the \"inadequacy\" test must be looked\n\nat in context of the facts of the specific case. That context leads to\n\nthe caveat: should, in the course of this litigation, the trial court\n\nconclude that the government appears not to represent adequately the\n\ninterest of Defenders, then it should reconsider afresh, on\n\napplication, the matter of intervention.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          Legend has it that salmon were once so plentiful in the great\n\nrivers of Maine that workers along the Kennebec River negotiated as a\n\nterm of employment that they would not be fed salmon for breakfast,\n\nlunch, and dinner. W.H. Bunting, A Day's Work (2000). In the year\n\n2000, by contrast, very few wild adult salmon returned to the seven\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fMaine Rivers at issue in this case (the Dennys, East Machias, Machias,\n\nPleasant, Narraguagus, Ducktrap, and Sheepscot Rivers). Me. Atl.\n\nSalmon     Comm'n,     2000      Trap     Catch     Statistics,      at\n\nhttp://www.state.me.us/asa/2000catchstats.html (last modified Nov. 3,\n\n2000). This is significant because the Atlantic Salmon spawns in\n\nfreshwater rivers. Young salmon live in those rivers for one to three\n\nyears before they undergo changes which enable them to live in\n\nsaltwater.   The salmon then migrate to the Atlantic Ocean.          In\n\nreproducing, they return to the streams where they were born, where the\n\nfemale salmon delivers the eggs.\n\n           Concerned about the decline in salmon population, in 1993 one\n\nof the conservation groups petitioned the Services to list the salmon\n\nas an \"endangered\" species under the Endangered Species Act (\"ESA\").\n\nSee 16 U.S.C. § 1540(g)(2)(C) (requiring written notice); 65 Fed. Reg.\n\n69,459 at 69,462 (2000) (providing a history of previous federal action\n\nconcerning the salmon).\n\n           \"Endangered species\" is a legal term of art that signifies\n\n\"any species which is in danger of extinction throughout all or a\n\nsignificant portion of its range.\"       16 U.S.C. § 1532(6).     It is\n\ncontrasted with \"threatened species,\" which signifies \"any species\n\nwhich is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable\n\nfuture.\"   Id. § 1532(20).    The ESA requires the Secretary of the\n\nInterior to \"determine whether any species is an endangered species or\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fa threatened species because of any of the following factors: (A) the\n\npresent or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its\n\nhabitat or range; (B) overutilization for commercial, recreational,\n\nscientific, or educational purposes; (C) disease or predation; (D) the\n\ninadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; or (E) other natural or\n\nmanmade factors affecting its continued existence.\" Id. § 1533(a)(1).\n\nThe Secretary must classify species as endangered or threatened \"solely\n\non the basis of the best scientific and commercial data available to\n\nhim after conducting a review of the status of the species and after\n\ntaking into account those efforts, if any, being made by any State . .\n\n. to protect such species.\"      Id. § 1533(b)(1)(A).\n\n          The purpose of such classification is to conserve the\n\nendangered or threatened species. See id. § 1531(b). But there are\n\ndifferences between the two classifications. While the ESA requires\n\nthe Secretary to issue regulations to provide for the conservation of\n\nthreatened species, id. § 1533(d), it also prohibits the import,\n\nexport, or taking of endangered species, id. § 1538(a)(1). When making\n\neither the \"threatened\" or \"endangered\" determination, the Secretary\n\nmust take state efforts to protect the species into account. Id. §\n\n1533(b)(1)(A). If the Secretary enters into a cooperative agreement\n\nwith a state to protect a threatened species, regulations to protect\n\nthat species, with the exception of regulations prohibiting the taking\n\nof that species, apply only to the extent that the state has adopted\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fthem.    Id. § 1533(d).\n\n           This legislative framework sets the stage for the regulatory\n\nhistory, which is essential to understanding Defenders' argument.\n\n                                 II.\n\n           In 1994, in response to the 1993 petition to list the\n\nAtlantic Salmon under the ESA, the Services published a notice in the\n\nFederal Register indicating that such a listing was potentially\n\nwarranted. 59 Fed. Reg. 3067 (1994). In 1995, the Services concluded\n\nthat the requested listing was not warranted because the salmon as they\n\nhad been described in the earlier petition did not meet the ESA's\n\ndefinition of a species. 60 Fed. Reg. 14,410 (1995).1 In this same\n\nnotice, the Services concluded that the Atlantic Salmon in seven Maine\n\nrivers did meet the ESA's criteria for a species because they were\n\nfound to be evolutionarily significant and reproductively isolated from\n\nother populations belonging to the same species.        Id. at 14,411-12.\n\n           In 1995, the Services published a proposed rule listing the\n\nGulf of Maine Distinct Population Segment (\"DPS\") of the Atlantic\n\nSalmon as threatened under the ESA. 60 Fed. Reg. 50,530 (1995). But\n\nin 1997, the Services withdrew the proposed rule because of scientific\n\ndata bearing on the health of the DPS and ongoing and planned actions\n\n     1    The 1993 petition requested the Services to list the\nnaturally spawning anadromous Atlantic Salmon throughout its known\nhistoric range in the United States. The Services \"determined that\navailable biological evidence\" did not support such a listing. 60 Fed.\nReg. at 14,412.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fto protect the Atlantic Salmon, including federal conservation efforts\n\nand the State of Maine's development of the \"Atlantic Salmon\n\nConservation Plan for Seven Maine Rivers.\" 62 Fed. Reg. 66,325 at\n\n66,332-37 (1997).\n\n          Maine's Conservation Plan addresses both ongoing and proposed\n\nactions to reduce threats to the Atlantic Salmon. Id. at 66,335. \"The\n\nstated intent of the Conservation Plan is to minimize human impacts on\n\nthe Atlantic salmon and restore the species . . . .\" Id. The Maine\n\nPlan identifies five categories of threats to the salmon: agriculture,\n\naquaculture, forestry, recreational fishing, and other natural and\n\nhuman related threats. Id. at 66,335-37. For each category of threat,\n\nthe Plan describes ongoing and planned future actions to protect the\n\nsalmon.   Id.\n\n          When deciding whether to classify a species as threatened or\n\nendangered under the ESA, the Secretary must consider the status of the\n\nspecies after accounting for any state efforts to protect the species.\n\n16 U.S.C. § 1533(b)(1)(A).     After doing so, the Services in 1997\n\nconcluded that ongoing actions had \"substantially reduced threats to\n\nthe species\" and that the DPS was \"not likely to become endangered in\n\nthe foreseeable future\" and so listing was \"not warranted\" at the time.\n\n62 Fed. Reg. 66,325 at 66,337.\n\n          In 1999, the proposed intervenors filed suit in the U.S.\n\nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia, challenging the Services'\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f1997 withdrawal of the proposed rule. While the D.C. litigation was\n\nunderway, the Services in November 1999 proposed a new rule that listed\n\nthe Gulf of Maine Salmon as endangered, 64 Fed. Reg. 62,627 (1999), not\n\nmerely threatened. Once a proposed listing rule is promulgated, the\n\nServices ordinarily have one year to make a final decision. 16 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1533(b)(6)(A)(i).\n\n          On June 14, 2000, the parties in the D.C. litigation entered\n\ninto a court-endorsed stipulation agreeing to stay that litigation\n\npending the Services' decision to promulgate or withdraw the proposed\n\nendangered species rule by November 17, 2000.        In entering the\n\nstipulation, the Services were modifying their unilateral ability to\n\nextend the review process by six months, see 16 U.S.C. § 1533(b)(6)(B).\n\nThe stipulation did provide that a party could ask the court to modify\n\nthe terms of the agreement. Eventually, the D.C. litigation concluded\n\nand judgment entered. The Services complied with the stipulation by\n\ndeciding within the stipulated time frame of one year.\n\n          The Services issued a final rule listing the Gulf of Maine\n\nAtlantic Salmon as an endangered species. 65 Fed. Reg. 69,459 (2000)\n\n(to be codified at 50 C.F.R. pts. 17 and 224). In their justification\n\nfor listing the Atlantic Salmon as endangered, the Services considered,\n\namong other factors, the low number of returning adult salmon, 65 Fed.\n\nReg. 69,459 at 69,461, 69,479, the escalating threat of disease, id. at\n\n69,476-77, and threats to the salmon from existing aquaculture\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fpractices, id. at 69,477-79.\n\n          The State of Maine, the Maine State Chamber of Commerce, and\n\nvarious Maine businesses and business associations challenged the\n\nregulation. They alleged, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure\n\nAct, that the Services' designation of the Maine Atlantic Salmon as\n\nendangered was arbitrary and capricious and should therefore be set\n\naside. See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) (1994). Their complaint included\n\nallegations that the Services (1) failed to base their listing decision\n\non the best available data; (2) ignored Maine's Plan to protect and\n\nrestore the salmon; (3) unlawfully agreed to restrict their own ability\n\nto extend the statutory deadline for regulating; and (4) acted\n\ninconsistently with their prior decision not to list the salmon as\n\nthreatened or endangered.\n\n                                 III.\n\n          We start with Defenders' challenge to the district court's\n\ndenial of their motion for intervention of right. Intervention of\n\nright, in the absence of a federal statute granting intervention, is\n\ngoverned by Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2), which states:\n\n          Upon timely application anyone shall be permitted to\n          intervene in an action: . . . (2) when the applicant claims\n          an interest relating to the property or transaction which is\n          the subject of the action and the applicant is so situated\n          that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter\n          impair or impede the applicant's ability to protect that\n          interest, unless the applicant's interest is adequately\n          represented by existing parties.\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fThis suit largely turns2 on the clause \"unless the applicant's interest\n\nis adequately represented by existing parties.\"\n\n          The appellate standard of review in this Circuit is that\n\n\"[w]e will reverse the denial of a motion to intervene as of right 'if\n\nthe court fails to apply the general standard provided by the text of\n\nRule 24(a)(2), or if the court reaches a decision that so fails to\n\ncomport with the standard as to indicate an abuse of discretion.'\"\n\nPublic Serv.

Rather, they will likely say that the sum of information\n\navailable to them justified the 2000 designation.\n\n            Defenders argue that the Supreme Court has said that\n\napplicants for intervention need only make a \"minimal\" showing that\n\nrepresentation \"may be\" inadequate.

The court applied Trbovich and this Circuit's law\n\nand there is no serious argument that the court misapprehended the\n\nlegal standard in its careful analysis. In addition, this case is\n\nmeaningfully different from Trbovich. In Trbovich, the Court's doubts\n\nabout the adequacy of the government's representation stemmed from the\n\nLabor Secretary's statutory duty to represent the \"two distinct\n\ninterests\" of the individual union members and the general public. 404\n\nU.S. at 538-39.

E.g., Mass. Food\n\nAss'n, 197 F.3d at 567.     Indeed, our cases use the language of\n\n\"presumption.\"     E.g., id. at 566-67; Daggett, 172 F.3d at 111.\n\nAlthough the bar is raised higher for proposed intervenors in this\n\nsituation, there is danger in a mechanistic application of such\n\nlanguage. \"Presumption\" means no more in this context than calling for\n\nan adequate explanation as to why what is assumed -- here, adequate\n\nrepresentation -- is not so. See Fed. R. Evid. 301; 2 McCormick on\n\nEvidence § 344 at 445-46 (John W. Strong et al. eds., 5th ed. 1999).\n\nThe facts of these cases vary greatly and whether the proposed\n\nintervenors' explanation of inadequacy suffices must be determined \"in\n\nkeeping with a commonsense view of the overall litigation.\" Patch,\n\n136 F.3d at 204.\n\n                                -15-\n\f          Here, Defenders have offered an explanation and the question\n\nis whether the district court abused its discretion in concluding that\n\nthe explanation did not presently suffice.        As the case is now\n\nconfigured, we cannot find abuse of discretion. At bottom Defenders\n\nshow one argument which they wish to present and (we assume) the\n\ngovernment does not. The district court has said, through its grant of\n\namicus-plus status, that it will hear the arguments Defenders wish to\n\npresent. At oral argument before our Court, the plaintiff business\n\ninterests have said they will not object to Defenders presenting\n\narguments on the basis that they are not intervenors (and will respond\n\nto the arguments on the merits).     And our cases have said that a\n\ndifference in tactics as to presenting a legal argument does not\n\nnecessarily an inadequacy make.      E.g., Daggett, 172 F.3d at 112.\n\n          The argument Defenders wish to advance may be thought of as\n\na supplement to the defendants' main argument in the case. The main\n\nargument, under the APA, concerns whether the 2000 designation is\n\n\"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in\n\naccordance with law.\" 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). Whether the Services\n\nshould have earlier so designated the salmon may be a building block in\n\nan argument, but is hardly a necessary one to the defense. Defenders'\n\nadditional argument is better thought of as a rejoinder to plaintiffs'\n\nargument that the Services' different result in 2000 than in 1997 is\n\nevidence that the 2000 decision was arbitrary. There are several\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\fobvious, more direct arguments for the government to make in response\n\nin which the Services and Defenders have a common interest, and which\n\ndo not depend on the alternate argument.\n\n          Defenders seek to wrap themselves in decisions of this Court\n\nreversing district court decisions denying intervention.

Further, in\n\nConservation Law Foundation, the government did not answer or defend\n\nthe case but simply agreed to a consent decree that imposed additional\n\nburdens on and was unacceptable to intervenors.

It is difficult to analyze\n\n\"inadequacy\" without looking at the strength of the interests the\n\nwould-be intervenors present and the tests of inadequacy may vary with\n\nthe strength of the interests. Daggett, 172 F.3d at 111, 113-14.\n\nThese proposed intervenors, like those in Daggett, are more in the\n\nmiddle of the range as to strength of interests, and, as in Daggett, an\n\nappellate court is hard pressed to reverse a district court's decision,\n\neither way it goes.\n\n                                 -17-\n\f          Given plaintiffs' emphasis on the Services' supposed \"change\"\n\nof position, we might view this case differently if the argument\n\nDefenders wish to present depended on introduction of evidence that the\n\nServices would refuse to present.4      But review of federal agency\n\nadministrative actions is usually confined to the record before the\n\nagency.

An earlier adverse\n\n\n\n     4    Plaintiff business interests informed the district court they\nwish to discover and introduce evidence outside of the record. The\nUnited States has taken the position review is restricted to the\nrecord. We take no position on the matter.\n\n                                 -18-\n\frelationship with the government does not automatically make for a\n\npresent adverse relationship.\n\n          Here, the Services did not designate the Atlantic Salmon as\n\nendangered under litigation compulsion to reach that result, but rather\n\nof their own accord.    Further, the Services' endangered species\n\ndesignation goes beyond what Defenders sought in the earlier\n\nlitigation. After all, Defenders' suit challenged the 1997 withdrawal\n\nof the designation of the Atlantic Salmon as \"threatened,\" a\n\ndesignation which provides less protection. The articulated reasoning\n\nsupporting the Services' 2000 designation cites to new studies and\n\ninformation not available at the time of the earlier litigation. This\n\nfact distinguishes the subject matter of this litigation from the\n\nearlier case.   The prior litigation was not marked by the sort of\n\nconduct from the government that would evidence bad faith.

In another case\n\ninvolving different facts, a prior adversary relationship might\n\nsuffice.

The main purpose\n\nof the argument seems to be to reinforce the antagonism point discussed\n\nabove.     On its own terms the argument is without merit.       As the\n\ndistrict judge correctly and succinctly concluded, all that Defenders\n\nwon was a stipulation that the Services would decide what to do on\n\nlisting the Atlantic Salmon by a particular date. That bargain was\n\nkept, the decision was made, and there is no risk to that completed\n\nbargain in this litigation.6\n\n            As to permissive intervention, appellate review is even more\n\nrestrictive. Daggett, 172 F.3d at 113. The district court denied\n\nintervention because it felt intervention would delay and complicate\n\nmatters.    This was a judgment call for the court.     It applied the\n\n\n     5     In a footnote, Defenders argue that the change of\nadministration also makes the Services' representation inadequate.
