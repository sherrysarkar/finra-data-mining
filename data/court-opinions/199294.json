Ernest C. Torres, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge,\n               Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                  and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     George E. Lieberman and Tillinghast, Licht, Perkins, Smith\n& Cohen on brief for appellant.\n     Gerhard P. Hutter on brief pro se.\n\n\n\n\n                      February 21, 2001\n\f            Per Curiam.        The court has determined that oral\n\nargument may be dispensed with in this case.                    See Fed. R.\n\nApp.   P.   34(a)(2)(C);      1st   Cir.    Loc.   R.    34(b).        After   a\n\nthorough    review     of    the    record     and      of     the     parties’\n\nsubmissions, we find that we do have jurisdiction over this\n\ninterlocutory    appeal,      and   we     reverse      the    lower   court’s\n\ndecision     denying        appellant       George        E.     Lieberman’s\n\n(“Lieberman’s”) motion to withdraw from his representation\n\nof his clients, Industrial Distribution Corporation (“IDC”)\n\nand Gerhard Hutter (“Hutter”).\n\n            This is an appropriate interlocutory appeal under\n\nthe collateral order doctrine.               See   Cohen v. Beneficial\n\nIndus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 546 (1949).                   An order which\n\ndoes not terminate an action by disposing of all rights of\n\nthe parties nevertheless is reviewable if: 1) the order\n\nconclusively resolves an important question 2) which is\n\nentirely separate from the merits and 3) if the matter will\n\nevade adequate review on appeal.               Id.; United States v.\n\nQuintana-Aguayo, 235 F.3d 682, 684 (1 st Cir. 2000).                     It is\n\nclear that the order below conclusively resolved an important\n\nquestion entirely separate from the merits: the question of\n\nwhether appellee’s attorney should be allowed to withdraw.\n\fFurthermore, we find that the matter will evade adequate\n\nreview on appeal.    An order requiring an attorney to continue\n\nrepresenting a client in a civil action without compensation\n\nmay subject the attorney to irreparable harm and amounts to\n\nan order of specific performance.       See Whiting v. Lacara, 187\n\nF.3d 317 (2d Cir. 1999).      We may proceed to the merits.\n\n         “The grant or denial of an attorney’s motion to\n\nwithdraw in a civil case is a matter addressed to the\n\ndiscretion of the trial court and will be reversed on appeal\n\nonly when the trial court has abused its discretion.”           See\n\nAndrews v. Bechtel Power Corp., 780 F.2d 124, 135 (1st Cir.\n\n1985) (quoting Washington v. Sherwin Real Estate, Inc., 694\n\nF.2d 1081, 1087 (7th Cir. 1982)).       We conclude that in this\n\ninstance, the lower court did abuse its discretion.\n\n         Rhode      Island   District   Court    Local   Rule   4(d)\n\nprovides that “[t]he Rules of Professional Conduct of the\n\nRhode Island Supreme Court shall be the standard of conduct\n\nfor all attorneys practicing before this court,” and the\n\nsupreme court rules in turn provide the grounds upon which\n\nan attorney may seek leave to withdraw.         Those rules in part\n\nprovide that an attorney may withdraw if:\n\n         (4) the client fails substantially to\n         fulfill an obligation to the lawyer\n         regarding the lawyer’s services and has\n\n\n                                -4-\n\f          been given reasonable warning that the\n          lawyer   will   withdraw   unless  the\n          obligation is fulfilled;\n\n\n          (5) the representation will result in an\n          unreasonable financial burden on the\n          lawyer or has been rendered unreasonably\n          difficult by the client; or\n\n\n          (6) other      good    cause    for    withdrawal\n          exists.\n\n\nR.I. S. Ct. R. 1.17(b)(4) - (6).              These factors provide\n\ngrounds   for    withdrawal    even   where     withdrawal   cannot    be\n\naccomplished      “without    material    adverse     effect   on     the\n\ninterests of the client.”       See R.I. S. Ct. R. 1.17(b) (“[A]\n\nlawyer may withdraw from representing a client if withdrawal\n\ncan be accomplished without material adverse effect on the\n\ninterests of the client, or if . . . (4) the client fails\n\nsubstantially . . . .”) (emphasis added).\n\n          Clearly     Hutter    has    “fail[ed]    substantially      to\n\nfulfill an obligation to [Lieberman] regarding the lawyer’s\n\nservices,”      R.I. S. Ct. R. 1.17(b)(4), because he has failed\n\nto pay Lieberman over $80,000 in fees owed to him, in\n\nderogation of their written fee agreement.           Before moving to\n\nwithdraw, Lieberman also gave him sufficient warning that a\n\nfailure to bring his account up to date would result in his\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fwithdrawal from the case.           Though only three weeks passed\n\nbetween the time the first bill became past due and the time\n\nLieberman moved to withdraw, three additional weeks passed\n\nbefore the district court heard and denied the motion.                     In\n\nthat interim, Hutter’s private attorney revealed that Hutter\n\nhad no money to pay Lieberman, and Hutter indicated he had\n\nno reasonable prospect of being able to pay him unless the\n\nlitigation     was   successful.          Also,   in     previous    months\n\nLieberman     repeatedly    had    to    remind   Hutter    to    bring   the\n\nretainer back up to its required balance, so Lieberman’s\n\nquick action once the first payment became past due seems\n\nreasonable.\n\n            Thus, withdrawal under the circumstances certainly\n\nwould have been consistent with the Local Rules.                    Further,\n\nLieberman faces substantial additional financial exposure\n\nshould he be required to go forward.                     Several pretrial\n\nmatters have yet to be resolved, and the trial itself will\n\nlast more than a week.           Counsel already has expenses that\n\nhave not been reimbursed, and there may well be additional\n\nsubstantial expenses that will need to be incurred at trial.\n\nIt   simply    expects     too    much    of   counsel     to    expend   the\n\nadditional energy necessary to go to trial, and to front the\n\nnecessary expenses, without any real assurance that he will\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fbe paid for any of it, especially where he already is owed\n\na substantial sum and the client has violated the written fee\n\nagreement. Further, if counsel does not expend the necessary\n\neffort and does not front the trial expenses, he very well\n\ncould expose himself to civil liability to his client.           We\n\nrefuse to place counsel in such a position.           Under these\n\ncircumstances, the lower court abused its discretion in\n\nrefusing to let Lieberman withdraw.\n\n            Furthermore, Hutter was less than forthcoming with\n\nLieberman when he signed the fee agreement.            Apparently\n\nHutter knew from the beginning that he would be unable to pay\n\nhis legal fees if he were not successful in the litigation.\n\nIt appears that he and his wife expected that as a practical\n\nmatter, Lieberman’s representation of them at some point\n\nwould   evolve    into   a   contingency    arrangement,   whereby\n\nLieberman was to be paid (if at all) out of the proceeds of\n\nthe litigation.     But that was not the arrangement to which\n\nLieberman    agreed.      Under   these   circumstances,   fairness\n\ndictates that Hutter, not Lieberman, suffer the consequences\n\nof his own failure to honor his agreement.\n\n            Further, we do not think the decision here should\n\nhinge entirely on the assertion that the case was nearly\n\nready for trial.       Despite the court’s apparent attempts to\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fmove this case to trial quickly, that goal does not seem to\n\nhave been realistic.          At least one discovery dispute was\n\noutstanding; that dispute had been referred to a magistrate\n\njudge,   who   had    not   set   the   matter    for   hearing    until\n\napproximately two weeks after the trial judge had planned to\n\ntry the case.        A partial summary judgment motion was not\n\nfully briefed until approximately two weeks before the trial\n\ndate, and that, too, had been referred to the magistrate\n\njudge.    Moreover,     the    opposing   party   apparently      is   not\n\npushing to get the matter to trial, as it agreed to a stay\n\nof all proceedings pending this appeal.           Though certainly a\n\ndistrict court should consider the stage of the litigation\n\nwhen deciding an attorney’s motion to withdraw, here we find\n\nthat the timing issues should not have been determinative.\n\n          Appellant’s motion to strike is denied. Appellee’s\n\nmotion to file reply brief is allowed.            The decision of the\n\nlower court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this order.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\f",

Counsel already has expenses that\n\nhave not been reimbursed, and there may well be additional\n\nsubstantial expenses that will need to be incurred at trial.\n\nIt   simply    expects     too    much    of   counsel     to    expend   the\n\nadditional energy necessary to go to trial, and to front the\n\nnecessary expenses, without any real assurance that he will\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fbe paid for any of it, especially where he already is owed\n\na substantial sum and the client has violated the written fee\n\nagreement. Further, if counsel does not expend the necessary\n\neffort and does not front the trial expenses, he very well\n\ncould expose himself to civil liability to his client.           We\n\nrefuse to place counsel in such a position.           Under these\n\ncircumstances, the lower court abused its discretion in\n\nrefusing to let Lieberman withdraw.\n\n            Furthermore, Hutter was less than forthcoming with\n\nLieberman when he signed the fee agreement.            Apparently\n\nHutter knew from the beginning that he would be unable to pay\n\nhis legal fees if he were not successful in the litigation.\n\nIt appears that he and his wife expected that as a practical\n\nmatter, Lieberman’s representation of them at some point\n\nwould   evolve    into   a   contingency    arrangement,   whereby\n\nLieberman was to be paid (if at all) out of the proceeds of\n\nthe litigation.     But that was not the arrangement to which\n\nLieberman    agreed.      Under   these   circumstances,   fairness\n\ndictates that Hutter, not Lieberman, suffer the consequences\n\nof his own failure to honor his agreement.\n\n            Further, we do not think the decision here should\n\nhinge entirely on the assertion that the case was nearly\n\nready for trial.       Despite the court’s apparent attempts to\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fmove this case to trial quickly, that goal does not seem to\n\nhave been realistic.          At least one discovery dispute was\n\noutstanding; that dispute had been referred to a magistrate\n\njudge,   who   had    not   set   the   matter    for   hearing    until\n\napproximately two weeks after the trial judge had planned to\n\ntry the case.        A partial summary judgment motion was not\n\nfully briefed until approximately two weeks before the trial\n\ndate, and that, too, had been referred to the magistrate\n\njudge.    Moreover,     the    opposing   party   apparently      is   not\n\npushing to get the matter to trial, as it agreed to a stay\n\nof all proceedings pending this appeal.           Though certainly a\n\ndistrict court should consider the stage of the litigation\n\nwhen deciding an attorney’s motion to withdraw, here we find\n\nthat the timing issues should not have been determinative.\n\n          Appellant’s motion to strike is denied. Appellee’s\n\nmotion to file reply brief is allowed.            The decision of the\n\nlower court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this order.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\f</pre>",
