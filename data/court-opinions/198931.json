VINICK,\n\n                     Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                              v.\n\n                        UNITED STATES,\n\n                     Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n               FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n         [Hon. Robert E. Keeton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                         ERRATA SHEET\n\n     The opinion of this Court issued on March 8, 2000, is\namended as follows:\n\n     Page 20, line 9: Add a new footnote number “8” after the\nperiod ending the sentence: “Responsibility during one period\ndoes not equate to responsibility in all periods.”\n\n     The text for the new footnote 8 is as follows: “We do not\nmean to suggest that in all § 6672 cases a district court is\nprecluded from considering evidence from outside the quarters in\nquestion. For example, behavior in one quarter, depending on\nthe circumstances, could cast light on one's status as a\nresponsible person in other quarters. Because one's function\nand status can change between quarters, however, it would be\nerroneous   based   solely  on   evidence   from   one   quarter\nautomatically to conclude that a person is responsible in\nanother quarter.”\n\fAlter   the   subsequent   footnotes'   numbering   accordingly.\n\f",
