Robert E. Keeton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge,\n               Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                  and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n\n    Van L. Hayhow on brief for appellant.\n    Juan Ortiz on brief pro se.\n\n\n\n\n                        April 12, 2001\n\f           Per Curiam. Defense counsel for Juan R. Ortiz has\n\nsubmitted an Anders brief and motion to withdraw, asserting\n\nthat there are no meritorious issues to be raised on appeal.\n\nSee Anders v. State of California, 386 U.S. 738, 744 (1967).\n\nOrtiz filed a pro se supplemental brief raising a single\n\nissue: that his attorney provided ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel because he failed to seek a downward departure based\n\nupon   Ortiz’   pre-trial   detention     at    the     Wyatt   Detention\n\nFacility   under    unconstitutional       conditions.           Ortiz   is\n\nrepresented by new counsel on appeal.\n\n           Ortiz pled guilty to four counts of conspiracy and\n\ndistributing    and    possessing   with       intent    to     distribute\n\nheroin.    The plea was pursuant to a written plea agreement\n\nin which the parties agreed that they would not seek a\n\ndeparture from the applicable guideline sentencing range.\n\nThe transcript of the guilty plea hearing reveals that the\n\ndistrict    court     complied   with    the     requirements       under\n\nFed.R.Crim.P. 11.\n\n           The PSR recommended a two-level reduction in the\n\nbase offense level, beyond what was specified in the plea\n\nagreement, because Ortiz met the criteria set forth in\n\nU.S.S.G. § 5C1.2.        Accordingly, the five-year statutory\n\nminimum sentence did not apply.         The PSR included a detailed\n\fstatement of facts, to which neither party objected.                         The\n\nsentencing         court    followed     the        PSR’s     recommendations,\n\nincluding      a     three-level       reduction       for     acceptance     of\n\nresponsibility.            The   government     complied       with   the   plea\n\nagreement, by recommending a sentence of 37 months, at the\n\nlow end of the applicable guideline sentencing range, and a\n\nsupervised release term of four years.                      The court accepted\n\nthat recommendation in imposing the sentence.                     Although the\n\nplea agreement had included a waiver by Ortiz of his right\n\nto appeal, the sentencing court did not enforce the waiver\n\nand informed Ortiz of his right to appeal his sentence.\n\n              In a supplemental pro se brief, Ortiz argues that\n\nhis attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel\n\nbecause he did not seek a downward departure on the basis of\n\nthe conditions of Ortiz’ pre-trial detention at the Wyatt\n\nDetention      Facility,         a   non-federal,           maximum   security\n\nfacility.      However, this court does not find the ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel claim to be a meritorious appellate\n\nissue.\n\n              First, this court would not be the proper forum for\n\nOrtiz    to   first    present       this    ineffective        assistance    of\n\ncounsel claim:\n\n              We have       repeatedly       held    that “fact-\n              specific        claims          of      ineffective\n\n                                       -3-\n\f               assistance cannot make their debut on\n               direct review of criminal convictions,\n               but, rather must originally be presented\n               to, and acted upon by, the trial court.\n               United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1063\n               (1st Cir. 1993)(citing cases). We have\n               allowed   exceptions   only   when   the\n               critical facts are not in dispute and\n               the record is sufficiently developed to\n               allow reasoned consideration of the\n               claim. Id.”\n\n\nUnited    States    v.     Hoyle,   237    F.3d    1,    8   (1 st   Cir.   2001)\n\n(quoting United States v. Bierd, 217 F.3d 15, 23-24 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).\n\n               Second, this court has never before held that\n\nconditions of confinement constitute a permissible basis for\n\ndownward departure.           Although some district courts have\n\ngranted    a    downward     departure     on     that   basis,       “no   clear\n\nconsensus exists as to the propriety of granting a downward\n\ndeparture for conditions of pretrial confinement.” United\n\nStates v. Francis, 129 F.Supp.2d 612, 615 (S.D.N.Y. 2001)\n\n(collecting cases).\n\n               Third, in his plea agreement, Ortiz agreed not to\n\nseek a downward departure from the applicable guideline\n\nsentencing range.          Therefore, if his attorney had sought a\n\ndownward       departure    at   sentencing,       he    would       have   acted\n\ncontrary to the terms of Ortiz’ plea agreement.                       Ortiz has\n\nnot indicated a desire to withdraw his plea.                   His attorney’s\n\n                                     -4-\n\ffailure   to   breach   the   plea    agreement    could    scarcely\n\nconstitute     ineffective    assistance   of     counsel   in   such\n\ncircumstances.\n\n          Our careful and thorough review of the entire\n\nrecord, including transcripts of the change of plea and\n\nsentencing hearings, does not reveal any meritorious grounds\n\nfor challenging Ortiz’ sentence or guilty plea.\n\n          Counsel’s motion to withdraw is granted.           Ortiz’\n\nconviction and sentenced are affirmed, without prejudice to\n\nhis raising his ineffective assistance of counsel claim in\n\na motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f",
