As Judge\r\n\nPerez-Gimenez  had   also  been  the  trial   judge  in  that\r\n\nproceeding,  he  was  the   appropriate  judge  to  hear  the\r\n\npetition.      That  petitioner's   challenge  to   the  1986\r\n\nconvictions  and  sentences  was   based  on  the  1985  plea\r\n\nproceeding is immaterial.\r\n\n          Finally, we  find no merit in the argument that the\r\n\ndistrict court was  required to  accept as true,  or hold  an\r\n\nevidentiary   hearing   on,   Rivera-Feliciano's   conclusory\r\n\nallegation  that the  government had  sufficient evidence  to\r\n\nindict him in  1985 for  charges later included  in the  1986\r\n\nindictment.

Here, the government offered a plausible reason for its delay, which the district judge could evaluate based on his having presided over the trial, to wit, that the testimony of Jose Panzardi-Alvarez was deemed essential to the 1986 conspiracy prosecution.  The district court's determination that a separate hearing on the state of the government's evidence in 1985 was not needed in order to permit it to rule intelligently on the petition was well within its discretion.
