Ruben Lopez-Lopez, Ramon Luciano-del-\n\nRosario, and Carlos Santana were convicted of importation of, and\n\npossession with intent to distribute, approximately 700 kilograms of\n\ncocaine and for aiding and abetting these crimes. They were each\n\nsentenced to 235 months, or slightly less than 20 years, in prison.\n\n          Lopez-Lopez, Luciano, and Santana challenge their convictions\n\non numerous grounds. Summing the arguments of all three, they claim\n\nthe district court erred by: (1) denying Santana's motion to dismiss\n\nbased on \"inadequate\" legal instruction to the grand jury; (2) refusing\n\nto suppress evidence obtained from their arrests, which Lopez-Lopez\n\nalleges to have been without probable cause; (3)            admitting\n\nidentification evidence of Luciano, which they allege to have violated\n\ntheir due process rights; (4) admitting testimony that Lopez-Lopez told\n\nLuciano to remain silent when the police were questioning Luciano; (5)\n\nallowing the government's witness to provide expert testimony based on\n\nhis prior experiences prosecuting drug cases; (6) ordering the\n\nprosecutor to demonstrate the use of a spotlight in the courtroom; (7)\n\nrefusing to instruct the jury that it could consider prior testimony by\n\ngovernment witnesses as substantive evidence on behalf of the\n\nappellants under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(1)(A); (8) refusing to instruct\n\nthe jury to acquit Santana if the jury determined that Santana was just\n\nas likely to have been smuggling aliens; (9) sentencing them on the\n\nevidence presented, which they allege is insufficient; (10) sentencing\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fthem in violation of Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000); and\n\n(11) refusing to allow them access to discovery concerning their\n\nconstitutional challenge to the appointment of United States Attorney\n\nGuillermo Gil.\n\n          Although this is a close case on the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence of Santana's guilt, we reject appellants' arguments and uphold\n\ntheir convictions and sentences. We note at the outset that we reject\n\nappellants' argument that the drug laws under which they were sentenced\n\nare unconstitutional under Apprendi.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          On the night of March 23, 1999, at approximately 3:00 a.m.,\n\nthe Rapid Action Force Unit (\"FURA\") of the Puerto Rico Police was on\n\nroutine patrol at sea. Three agents were on the patrol boat: Waldy\n\nVelez, Pedro Rivera, and Hector Camacho. On their radar, the FURA\n\nagents spotted another boat, about a quarter mile out at sea, with its\n\nlights off. The FURA boat approached this other boat. When the FURA\n\nboat was approximately 25 feet from the boat on radar, the agents\n\nshined the FURA boat's two spotlights on the other boat, which both\n\nagents Velez and Rivera saw was a speed boat with three men aboard.\n\nThe speed boat responded by speeding up, colliding with the FURA boat,\n\nand then heading on a zig-zag course toward shore. As the speed boat\n\nsped away, its occupants started to throw items overboard.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f          A few minutes later, when the speed boat neared the shore-\n\nline of Isla Matei, a small uninhabited island off the coast of\n\nmainland Puerto Rico, the speed boat's occupants abandoned ship, swam\n\nor waded to shore, and then ran onto the island. They were carrying\n\nplastic bags. Instead of pursuing the three men, the FURA agents\n\npursued the now unmanned speed boat and gained control of it. They\n\nfound 700 kilograms of cocaine in the speed boat and in the surrounding\n\nsea. The agents also found t-shirts, rain gear, wetsuits, a marine\n\nradio, a Global Positioning System (\"GPS\"), a satellite telephone, and\n\na cellular telephone.\n\n          One hour later, at approximately 4:00 a.m., two police\n\nofficers of the Yauco narcotics unit, Jose Alarcon and Octavio Cruz,\n\nwere driving down Highway 324. They had been advised that FURA agents\n\nwere pursuing a fleeing vessel with a load of drugs, and were headed\n\ntoward the Phosphorescent Bay area where there might be land crews\n\nwaiting to assist the drug-carrying boat.\n\n          On their way to the bay, the Yauco police officers saw three\n\nmen walking along Highway 324 in a rural area at least two miles from\n\nIsla Matei, where the boat's occupants had fled. These three men turned\n\nout to be the appellants: Lopez-Lopez, Luciano, and Santana. Officers\n\nAlarcon and Cruz did not know that the drug boat had been abandoned,\n\nnor did they know that three persons had fled the boat. The three men\n\nran into a field by the roadside and hid. There, officers Alarcon and\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fCruz apprehended them. Officers Alarcon and Cruz, with the assistance\n\nof police officers from the town of Lajas, who had arrived to assist\n\nthem, arrested the men and took them to the Guanica police station. At\n\nthe time of their arrest, only Lopez-Lopez spoke, and he stated that he\n\nhad been robbed and abandoned in the area. All three men appeared damp\n\nand exhausted. Only these three were found in the police search of the\n\narea.\n\n           At approximately 6:00 a.m., agents Velez and Rivera -- two\n\nof the FURA agents who had encountered and pursued the speed boat --\n\narrived at the Guanica station. Lopez-Lopez, Luciano, and Santana were\n\nbeing held in a central area on the first floor of the small, two-story\n\nstructure. Upon seeing the three men in handcuffs, agents Velez and\n\nRivera immediately identified Luciano as the pilot of the speed boat,\n\nbut the agents did not identify Lopez-Lopez or Santana. Neither a\n\nlineup nor a photographic display was ever conducted. The agents later\n\nconducted ion and fiber tests of the three men and their clothing in\n\norder to detect the presence of cocaine or fibers from the bales\n\nrecovered from the speed boat. All of the tests returned negative\n\nresults.\n\n           Three weeks later, Yauco police officer Cruz, accompanied by\n\ncustoms agent Ismael Padilla and other agents, returned to the site of\n\nthe earlier arrests. The purpose of their visit to the field was for\n\nofficer Cruz to show agent Padilla where the arrests occurred, not to\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fgather evidence. Although no evidence was found in the field at the\n\ntime the three were arrested, this time the agents found several items,\n\nincluding a cellular telephone and a bag containing money and two\n\nwallets.   None of the wallets contained identification of the\n\ndefendants. Through telephone record analysis of the telephone found\n\nin the field, it was determined that, at 3:27 a.m. on the night the\n\nspeed boat was apprehended and the defendants were arrested, a call was\n\nplaced from the cellular telephone to a telephone accessible to\n\nresidents in the building where Lopez-Lopez lived.\n\n           Lopez-Lopez, Luciano, and Santana were indicted on two\n\ncounts: (1) possession with intent to distribute, and aiding and\n\nabetting possession with intent to distribute, 700 kilograms of\n\ncocaine, 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1); 18 U.S.C. § 2, and (2) importation, and\n\naiding and abetting importation, of 700 kilograms of cocaine, 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 952(a); 18 U.S.C. § 2. After a month-long jury trial, the three\n\ndefendants were convicted on both counts. At sentencing, the district\n\ncourt determined in separate proceedings that, given the nature of the\n\noffenses and the amount of cocaine involved, each defendant's base\n\noffense level was 38. Given a criminal history category of I, the\n\ndistrict court found that the guidelines imprisonment range was 235 to\n\n293 months. On July 10, 2000, the trial judge sentenced each defendant\n\nto 235 months in prison.\n\n                                 II.\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fA. Grand Jury Instructions (Santana)\n\n          Santana renews his pretrial argument that the indictment\n\nshould be dismissed because he says the grand jury was inadequately\n\ninstructed in violation of Fed. R. Crim. P. 6 and the Due Process\n\nClause of the Fifth Amendment. He requests that we review the grand\n\njury minutes in order to answer several questions he raised in the\n\ndistrict court about the grand jury instructions.1\n\n          We review the district court's refusal to dismiss the\n\nindictment de novo because Santana's claim is a purely legal one.\n\nUnited States v. Balsam, 203 F.3d 72, 81 n.8 (1st Cir. 2000) (de novo\n\nreview). We affirm the district court's denial of Santana's motion to\n\ndismiss the indictment for two reasons. First, under federal law the\n\nprosecutor is not obligated to provide legal instruction to the grand\n\njury. Second, the alleged errors in the grand jury proceedings are\n\nharmless in light of the petit jury proceedings and verdict.\n\n          \"[N]either the Fifth Amendment nor any other constitutional\n\nprovision prescribes the kind of evidence upon which grand juries must\n\nact.\" Costello v. United States, 350 U.S. 359, 362 (1956). \"Courts .\n\n\n\n     1     Santana requests that we determine (1) whether legal\ninstructions were read to the grand jury; (2) if so, whether the\ninstructions were read at the beginning of the proceedings or at the\nend; (3) whether the grand jurors who heard the instructions were the\nsame ones that indicted Santana; (4) whether the grand jury received\ninstructions on the meaning of \"probable cause\"; and (5) whether the\ngrand jury was advised of certain facts alleged to be material. We\ndecline to pursue Santana's suggested inquiries.\n\n                                 -8-\n\f. . generally have found that the prosecutor satisfactorily explains\n\nthe offense to be charged by simply reading the statute to the grand\n\njury.\"2 4 Criminal Procedure § 15.7(g), at 450 (LaFave et al., eds.,\n\n2d ed. 1999). \"The prosecutor is under no obligation to give the grand\n\njury legal instructions.\" United States v. Zangger, 848 F.2d 923, 925\n\n(8th Cir. 1988); accord United States v. Kenny, 645 F.2d 1323, 1347\n\n(9th Cir. 1981).   Santana's motion to dismiss the indictment was\n\nproperly denied.\n\n          In addition, Santana was subsequently and properly convicted\n\nby a petit jury and so the alleged errors in the grand jury proceeding\n\nare harmless. United States v. Mechanik, 475 U.S. 66 (1986) (upholding\n\nconvictions, despite violation of Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(d)); United States\n\nv. Flores-Rivera, 56 F.3d 319, 328 (1st Cir. 1995).      \"[T]he petit\n\njury's verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt demonstrates a\n\nfortiori that there was probable cause to charge the defendants with\n\nthe offenses for which they were convicted.\" Mechanik, 475 U.S. at 67.\n\n\n\n\n     2     Santana relies on New York state case law to the contrary,\nbut this state case law is inapposite. People v. Calbud, Inc., 402\nN.E.2d 1140 (N.Y. 1980), like the other cases on which Santana relies\nfor the proposition that prosecutors must provide legal instructions to\ngrand juries, interprets New York law requiring prosecutors to provide\nlegal guidance to the grand jury, see N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law § 190.25\nsubd. 6 (Consol. 2001). This state law requirement does not bear on\nour interpretation of what federal law requires.\n\n                                 -9-\n\fB. Unlawful Arrest (Lopez-Lopez)\n\n\n\n\n                             -10-\n\f          Lopez-Lopez argues that the district court erred by refusing\n\nto suppress all evidence obtained from his arrest, as well as the\n\narrests of Luciano and Santana,3 all of which he alleges were without\n\nprobable cause.    Lopez-Lopez concedes that he did not raise the\n\nunlawful arrest argument in the district court and that it is therefore\n\nforfeited. Nonetheless, he argues that under United States v. Olano,\n\n507 U.S. 725, 731-32 (1993), there was a plain error affecting\n\nsubstantial rights and, accordingly, this court should provide relief.\n\nWe treat his argument as waived under Rule 12(f) rather than as\n\nforfeited.\n\n          Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(b) requires that motions to suppress be\n\nraised prior to trial. Rule 12(f) provides that a \"[f]ailure by a\n\nparty\" to so move \"shall constitute waiver.\" A court may \"grant relief\n\nfrom the waiver\" if a party shows cause.4 Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(f).\n\nLopez-Lopez did not move to suppress the fruits of the allegedly\n\nunlawful arrests prior to trial and so his argument is waived under\n\nRule 12(f). United States v. Bashorun, 225 F.3d 9, 13 (1st Cir. 2000);\n\n\n\n     3     Because Fourth Amendment rights are personal to each\ndefendant, Lopez-Lopez may not vicariously assert the Fourth Amendment\nrights of his codefendants. United States v. Padilla, 508 U.S. 77, 81-\n82 (1993) (per curiam). We treat Lopez-Lopez's argument as an\nobjection to the evidence obtained from his own arrest.\n     4    The question whether an appellate court may review for plain\nerror despite a Rule 12(f) waiver, provided that the record enables\nreview, is open in this circuit. See United States v. Bashorun, 225\nF.3d 9, 16 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n                                 -11-\n\fUnited States v. Torres, 162 F.3d 6, 10-11 (1st Cir. 1998). Lopez-\n\nLopez has not even attempted to offer an explanation for his failure to\n\nmove to suppress.     He has not shown cause for relief and so his\n\nargument is waived.     Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(f).\n\n          The plain error review that Lopez-Lopez requests would be\n\ninconsistent with, and would allow Lopez-Lopez to escape from, his\n\nnoncompliance with Rule 12. The argument has been waived and he has\n\nshown no cause for relief. The district court record is insufficiently\n\ndeveloped, due to Lopez-Lopez's own failure to raise the issue, to\n\npermit reliable appellate review. United States v. Nuñez, 19 F.3d 719,\n\n722, 723 n.10 (1st Cir. 1994); see also Torres, 162 F.3d at 11 n.2\n\n(plain error review doctrine inapplicable where defendant has failed to\n\ndevelop factual record related to his suppression argument). That ends\n\nthe matter.\n\nC. Identification of Luciano (Lopez-Lopez, Luciano, Santana)\n\n          Lopez-Lopez, Luciano, and Santana challenge the district\n\ncourt's denial of Luciano's motion to suppress agent Velez's and agent\n\nRivera's pretrial identification of Luciano. All three object only to\n\nthe identification of Luciano, as agents Velez and Rivera never\n\nidentified Lopez-Lopez or Santana. Appellants argue that the show-up\n\nof Luciano to agents Velez and Rivera created a substantial likelihood\n\nof misidentification in violation of the Due Process Clause. 5\n\n\n     5    In the district court, neither Lopez-Lopez nor Santana moved\n\n                                 -12-\n\fSpecifically, Luciano appeals the district court's refusal to suppress\n\nevidence that at the Guanica station, about two and one-half hours\n\nafter pursuing the speed boat at sea and observing the boat's driver,\n\nagents Velez and Rivera identified Luciano as the driver.\n\n          The findings of the district court after a hearing on a\n\npretrial motion to suppress are binding on this court unless they are\n\nclearly erroneous. United States v. De Jesus-Rios, 990 F.2d 672, 677\n\n(1st Cir. 1993).     These findings determine the outcome here.\n\n          Pretrial identification evidence is subject to constitutional\n\nlimitations under the Due Process Clause. Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S.\n\n293, 298-99 (1967); United States v. Watson, 76 F.3d 4, 6 (1st Cir.\n\n1996) (citing Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98 (1977)). We employ a\n\ntwo-pronged analysis to determine whether evidence of a pretrial\n\nidentification should be suppressed. Watson, 76 F.3d at 6. \"First,\n\nthe court must determine whether the procedure was impermissibly\n\nsuggestive.\"   Id.   If so, then the court \"must decide whether the\n\nidentification itself was reliable under the totality of the\n\ncircumstances, notwithstanding the suggestive procedure.\" Id. The\n\n\n\n\nto suppress the identification of Luciano and so whatever arguments\nthey might have are waived. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(f). We consider\nLuciano's argument on appeal, which he previously raised in the\nNovember 19, 1999 suppression hearing. Little turns on this waiver,\nhowever, because the district court properly admitted the\nidentification evidence.\n\n                                -13-\n\flikelihood of misidentification must be very strong in order to\n\nsuppress the evidence.     Id.; De Jesus-Rios, 990 F.2d at 677.\n\n          There is little basis to overturn the district court's\n\nconclusion that the procedure was not impermissibly suggestive. This\n\nconclusion eliminates Luciano's due process argument. Watson, 76 F.3d\n\nat 6. The facts, as found by the district court, were that, after a\n\nlong night, agents Velez and Rivera returned to the Guanica station\n\nunaware that specific people had been arrested.       On entering the\n\nstation, the officers did not anticipate seeing detainees suspected of\n\noperating the speed boat, but the officers saw the three detainees, who\n\nwere being held downstairs because of the station's small size and\n\nupstairs offices.   Both officers immediately, spontaneously, and\n\nwithout being prompted, identified Luciano as the speed boat's pilot.\n\nThese facts do not make for an impermissibly suggestive show-up.\n\n          Luciano attempts to undermine the spontaneity of the\n\nidentification by pointing to three separate stories told about the\n\nidentification. Cf. Jackson v. Fogg, 589 F.2d 108 (2d Cir. 1978)\n\n(affirming district court's grant of habeas where conviction was based\n\nsolely on questionable identification procedures). But the district\n\ncourt rejected Luciano's alternative view of the facts and found \"no\n\nevidence whatsoever that the identification happened in any other form\n\nthan the spontaneous form in which the agents testified.\" We cannot\n\nsay that this conclusion was unreasonable.\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\f           Luciano also attempts to undercut the spontaneity of the\n\nidentification by arguing that the police could easily have used less\n\nsuggestive identification procedures and that there was no good reason\n\nfor allowing the detainees to sit on the first floor of the Guanica\n\nstation where agents Velez and Rivera might easily see them. But the\n\nfirst part of this argument assumes that an identification was\n\nintentionally contemplated by the Guanica police. The district court\n\nfound that at the time the identification occurred, the officers in the\n\nGuanica station were not attempting to undertake an identification; the\n\ndetainees were simply sitting downstairs. The government concedes that\n\nit did not attempt less suggestive identification procedures, such as\n\na lineup. But, as the district court concluded, \"there was no need for\n\na lineup\" after the officers immediately identified Luciano. The\n\nsecond part of Luciano's argument is that the police should not have\n\ndetained the suspects downstairs, where anyone walking in could see\n\nthem. No doubt the Guanica police might have been more careful. But\n\nthe detainees were downstairs because the Guanica station is a small,\n\ntwo-story building and it was not unreasonable to opt against holding\n\nthe suspects upstairs where the administrative offices are located.\n\nThese circumstances do not support Luciano's theory that this was all\n\na setup.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fD. Lopez-Lopez's Post-Arrest Statement (Lopez-Lopez, Luciano)\n\n\n\n\n                             -16-\n\f          Lopez-Lopez and Luciano allege that the district court\n\ncommitted reversible error at trial when it denied their objection to\n\nsuppress evidence of a statement Lopez-Lopez made at the Guanica\n\nstation. Lopez-Lopez told Luciano \"don't answer\"6 when Luciano was\n\nasked whether he knew anything about a shipment that had been seized.\n\nThe district court permitted officer Juan Arevalo-Echevarria, a\n\nsergeant in the Yauco drugs division, to testify that Lopez-Lopez had\n\ntold Luciano to remain silent. Both Lopez-Lopez and Luciano now argue\n\nthat officer Arevalo's testimony constituted improper comment on their\n\nrights to remain silent, in violation of their Fifth Amendment rights.\n\nLuciano also argues that the testimony violated the rule of Bruton v.\n\nUnited States, 391 U.S. 123 (1968), which prohibits admission of\n\ntestimony by a nontestifying defendant inculpating a codefendant in a\n\njoint trial.7\n\n          As to the first claim, that the admission of Lopez-Lopez's\n\nstatement telling Luciano not to answer violated both defendants' Fifth\n\nAmendment rights, we first note the general prohibition established in\n\nDoyle v. Ohio, 426 U.S. 610 (1976). Subject to certain exceptions,\n\nadmission of evidence of a defendant's post-arrest silence, after\n\n\n     6    Lopez-Lopez went on to say \"we don't know anything about the\nshipment,\" but that statement was not introduced at trial.\n     7    Lopez-Lopez, in one sentence of his brief, attempts to adopt\nLuciano's Bruton argument. But Bruton is unavailable to Lopez-Lopez\nbecause Lopez-Lopez is the declarant and the statement is therefore\nadmissible against him.\n\n                                 -17-\n\fMiranda warnings have been provided, to impeach an explanation a\n\ndefendant offers at trial, violates a defendant's Due Process rights.\n\nId. at 618-19.    Lopez-Lopez and Luciano say that Lopez-Lopez's\n\nstatement to Luciano fits the pattern governed by Doyle. Lopez-Lopez\n\nand Luciano characterize Lopez-Lopez's direction to Luciano, telling\n\nhim \"don't answer,\" as reminding Luciano of his legal right, under\n\nMiranda, to remain silent. They argue that Lopez-Lopez's reminder to\n\nLuciano of Luciano's right, and Luciano's exercise of his right to\n\nremain silent upon being reminded, are being used against both of them.\n\n          The Doyle argument fails because their post-Miranda silence\n\nwas not used against them at trial. Officer Arevalo testified about\n\nwhat Lopez-Lopez said, not as to the silence of either defendant. There\n\nwas no testimony as to whether Luciano responded to Lopez-Lopez's\n\nsuggestion by remaining silent and there was no testimony about either\n\nparty remaining silent in the face of questioning. That what Lopez-\n\nLopez said involved a statement about not saying anything does not put\n\nthe statement into the category of post-Miranda silence upon which\n\ncomment is impermissible. When an accused is given his Miranda rights,\n\nand then waives those rights by voluntarily making statements, he may\n\nnot rely on Doyle to object to the admission of those statements simply\n\nbecause the statements refer to the act of keeping silent. Cf. United\n\nStates v. Harris, 956 F.2d 177, 181 (8th Cir. 1992) (holding that it is\n\n\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\fpermissible to admit testimony that the accused ceased to answer\n\nquestions once the accused initially begins answering questions).\n\n          The Bruton argument also fails. The argument goes like this.\n\nWhen, in a joint trial, a statement is admitted of a defendant\n\nconfessing to a crime and implicating a codefendant, the codefendant\n\nmay be deprived of his Confrontation Clause rights by being unable to\n\nforce the confessing defendant to take the stand and be cross-examined\n\n(due to the confessing defendant's Fifth Amendment rights). Bruton,\n\n391 U.S. at 137. In such situations, a limiting instruction that the\n\njury should consider the statement only as to the confessing defendant\n\nmay be inadequate to protect the implicated codefendant. Id. The\n\ntheory here is that Lopez-Lopez's statement telling Luciano not to\n\nanswer tends to incriminate them both and is sufficiently like a\n\nconfession to warrant Bruton protection. We agree that it tends to be\n\nincriminating, but that does not answer the question of whether it is\n\nwithin Bruton's scope.\n\n          The challenged testimony here does not fall within Bruton,\n\nas that rule has developed. The statement \"don't answer\" is not a\n\nconfession. As we recently noted in Brown v. Maloney, 267 F.3d 36 (1st\n\nCir. 2001), Bruton does not necessarily apply, if indeed it ever\n\napplies, when such statements are involved. Id. at 41-42. We need not\n\nresolve this ambiguity because Lopez-Lopez's statement is not\n\nsufficiently close to a confession: that is, it is not powerfully\n\n\n                                -19-\n\fincriminating. See United States v. Smith, 46 F.3d 1223, 1227-28 (1st\n\nCir. 1995) (noting Bruton's requirement of \"express[ ]\" and \"powerful[\n\n]\" implication); Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200, 208 (1987) (holding\n\nthat Bruton applies when a nontestifying defendant's statement\n\n\"expressly implicat[es]\" a codefendant, leaving no doubt that it would\n\nbe \"powerfully incriminating\") (quoting Bruton, 391 U.S. at 124 n.1,\n\n135). The argument that the statement was of an \"incriminatory nature\"\n\nis insufficient to clear the hurdle requiring a powerfully\n\nincriminating statement. Cf. Brown, 267 F.3d at 42 (holding that it\n\nwas reasonable for a state court to conclude that Bruton did not apply\n\nin the absence of powerfully incriminating evidence). Lopez-Lopez's\n\n\"don't answer\" statement did not even mention any person or any crime\n\nor any criminal responsibility.\n\n            In addition, Luciano asked for neither a severance nor a\n\nlimiting instruction.      Of course, in a true Bruton confession\n\nsituation, a limiting instruction would not cure the harm. 391 U.S. at\n\n135-37. But Luciano's failure to even ask for a limiting instruction\n\nis a fair gauge for measuring the lack of harm to Luciano from the\n\nevidence.\n\nE. Expert Testimony (Lopez-Lopez, Luciano, Santana)\n\n            All three appellants renew their objections to the district\n\ncourt's decision to allow one of the government's witnesses, U.S.\n\nCustoms Service agent Jiménez, to provide expert testimony based on his\n\n\n                                  -20-\n\fprior experiences investigating drug importation operations. The\n\nparties agree that agent Jiménez was not in any way involved in the\n\ninvestigation of this case. The government characterizes the testimony\n\nas \"expert\" or \"quasi-expert\" and says that it offered it to explain to\n\nthe jury the modus operandi of individuals importing drugs into Puerto\n\nRico and the tools of that unlawful trade. Agent Jiménez testified\n\nabout how drug importation schemes use GPS to facilitate air drops and\n\nboat-to-boat transfers, and about how cellular telephones are used to\n\nenable boat-to-ground communication. The evidence was relevant because\n\na GPS and a cellular telephone were found on the speed boat in this\n\ncase and a cellular telephone was later found in the field where the\n\nthree were arrested.\n\n          Appellants attack on several fronts. They say that, under\n\nDaubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993), and\n\nKumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137 (1999), the district court\n\nfailed to apply the correct standard for admitting expert testimony.\n\nThey also characterize the drug importation scheme as \"plain vanilla\"\n\nand argue that expert testimony was unnecessary to help the jurors\n\nunderstand a type of criminal operation with which the jurors are\n\n\"familiar.\" Furthermore, they argue that agent Jiménez was incompetent\n\nto testify. Fed. R. Evid. 601. Finally, they argue that under Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 403 the evidence's \"probative value [was] substantially\n\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice\" and so the district court\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\fshould have excluded the evidence. We review for abuse of discretion\n\nthe district court's decision to admit this expert testimony. United\n\nStates v. Sebaggala, 256 F.3d 59, 66 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n          As to the wrong standard argument, Daubert, as amplified in\n\nKumho Tire, simply requires that the trial judge, under the Federal\n\nRules of Evidence, ensure that an expert's testimony \"both rests on a\n\nreliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.\" Daubert, 509\n\nU.S. at 597, quoted in Kumho Tire, 526 U.S. at 141; see also Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 702 & advisory committee's note (amended in response to Daubert\n\nand Kumho Tire). As Daubert stated, and Kumho Tire reaffirmed, the\n\ntest for reliability is \"flexible\" and \"Daubert's list of specific\n\nfactors neither necessarily nor exclusively applies to all experts or\n\nin every case.\" Kumho Tire, 526 U.S. at 141-42; see also Fed. R. Evid.\n\n702 advisory committee's note (stating that the Daubert factors are not\n\n\"exclusive [or] dispositive\"). Furthermore, \"the law grants a district\n\ncourt the same broad latitude when it decides how to determine\n\nreliability as it enjoys in respect to its ultimate reliability\n\ndetermination.\"    Kumho Tire, 526 U.S. at 142.\n\n          Both defense counsel and the district court were apprised of\n\nthe government's proposal to introduce agent Jiménez's expert\n\ntestimony. There is no reason to believe that the district court\n\nsomehow failed to perform its gatekeeping function: outside of the\n\npresence of the jury, the district court heard defense counsel's\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\fobjections to the expert testimony and the government's proffer. The\n\ncourt found that agent Jiménez's testimony was based on his experience\n\nwith how GPS and cellular telephones are used in drug operations. That\n\nthe court acted as gatekeeper is evident from its decision to sharply\n\nconstrain agent Jiménez's testimony.      The court permitted him to\n\ntestify where it believed his testimony was relevant and helpful, for\n\nexample, to explain the meaning of GPS coordinates found on the boat\n\nand to explain the range of cellular telephones at sea, but refused to\n\nallow him to testify where it thought the evidence was not relevant or\n\nhelpful, for example, to explain the presence of raincoats and wetsuits\n\non the boat.\n\n          Next is the claim that the expert testimony was improper\n\nbecause it related to subjects that the jurors could understand without\n\nsuch testimony. A district court may admit expert testimony if it\n\nfinds that \"specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to\n\nunderstand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\" Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 702. The district court has \"considerable latitude\" in deciding\n\nwhether expert testimony will be helpful to the jury. Sebaggala, 256\n\nF.3d at 65. We are mindful that \"[t]he trial judge has a hands-on\n\nfamiliarity with the nuances of the case -- nuances which may not\n\nsurvive transplantation into a cold appellate record.\" United States\n\nv. Hoffman, 832 F.2d 1299, 1310 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\f          Here, the trial judge determined that agent Jiménez's\n\ntestimony would help the jury understand the role of a GPS and cellular\n\ntelephones in marine drug importation schemes. Appellants have made no\n\nreasoned argument to support the claim that GPS, GPS coordinates, their\n\nlevel of accuracy, nautical charts, marine navigation, and the role of\n\nall of these things in drug smuggling operations are common knowledge.\n\nNor is there any evidence that cellular telephones, their ranges at\n\nsea, and their role in smuggling operations are within the typical\n\njuror's common knowledge. It is well established that, in drug cases,\n\nthe government may call expert witnesses to testify about criminal\n\nmodus operandi when such testimony would be helpful to the jury. \"We\n\nhave admitted expert testimony regarding the operation of criminal\n\nschemes and activities in a variety of contexts, finding such testimony\n\nhelpful to juries in understanding some obscure or complex aspect of\n\nthe crime.\" United States v. Montas, 41 F.3d 775, 783 (1st Cir. 1994);\n\nsee also United States v. Hensel, 699 F.2d 18, 38 (1st Cir. 1983)\n\n(upholding admission of testimony about drug smugglers' methods because\n\n\"smuggling tons of marijuana is a complex matter\" and thus expert\n\ntestimony would help the jury); accord United States v. Brown, 776 F.2d\n\n397, 400 (2d Cir. 1985).\n\n          Appellants also argue that agent Jiménez was incompetent to\n\ntestify under Fed. R. Evid. 601. They argue that the government, under\n\nthe guise of presenting expert testimony, presented prohibited lay\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\fopinion testimony regarding a matter of which agent Jiménez had no\n\npersonal knowledge. Again, we disagree. The district court cabined\n\nagent Jiménez's testimony, as already described. Agent Jiménez is a\n\nCustoms Service agent. He was a marine enforcement officer charged\n\nwith interdicting suspected vessels entering Puerto Rican waters. He\n\nspent fourteen years as an electronic technician with the Air Force and\n\nhe is an FCC-licensed radio operator. He has a degree in electrical\n\nengineering and has unique knowledge -- about GPS, cellular telephones,\n\nand the logistics of marine drug importation -- gained through\n\ninfiltrating organizations attempting to smuggle large quantities of\n\ncocaine into Puerto Rico. These factors persuade us that the district\n\ncourt was well within its discretion when it found agent Jiménez\n\ncompetent to testify as an expert.\n\n          Appellants' best and final argument is that, under Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 403, the evidence's \"probative value [was] substantially\n\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\" \"Even if admissible\n\nunder Rule 702, expert testimony still may be excluded under Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 403 if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the\n\nrisk of unfair prejudice it creates.\" Montas, 41 F.3d at 783. If a\n\ncellular telephone had not been found in the field as well as on the\n\nboat, appellants would have a better argument. The question at trial\n\nwas not whether there was a drug conspiracy (to which the GPS and\n\ncellular telephone on the boat went), but rather whether these\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\fdefendants were the drug conspirators. The cellular telephone in the\n\nfield went to the identity question of whether these defendants were\n\nthe ones associated with the drug boat. In this context, the district\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the probative\n\nvalue of the evidence outweighed any prejudice.\n\nF. Demonstrative Spotlight Evidence (Lopez-Lopez, Luciano)\n\n          Both Lopez-Lopez and Luciano object to the district court's\n\nsua sponte order requesting the prosecution to demonstrate the use of\n\na spotlight -- one of two different spotlights used on the FURA boat on\n\nthe night of the arrests -- in the courtroom.           They say the\n\ndemonstrative evidence was misleading and lacking in probative value.\n\nSee Fed. R. Evid. 403.       It has long been settled that this\n\ndetermination is within the district court's sound discretion. United\n\nStates v. Cartano, 420 F.2d 362, 364-65 (1st Cir. 1970); see also 4\n\nWeinstein's Federal Evidence § 611.02[2][a][iv] (J.M. McLaughlin ed.,\n\n2d ed. 2001) (noting the court's \"broad discretion\" in admitting\n\ndemonstrative evidence). Here, we do not think the district court\n\nabused its discretion.\n\n          Defendants put into dispute the extent to which the spotlight\n\nwould have permitted the officers to view Luciano under conditions\n\nresembling daylight, as the officers alleged and the defense denied.\n\nAgent Rivera demonstrated the spotlight by turning it on in court under\n\ncontrolled conditions.      The light was turned on for a period\n\n\n                                 -26-\n\fapproximating the two to three second period during which agents Velez\n\nand Rivera testified they witnessed Luciano on the night the speed boat\n\nwas apprehended. Furthermore, the light was flashed only in the corner\n\nof the courtroom, not on any of the appellants.\n\n           This demonstration was highly relevant.     It went to the\n\ncredibility of critical testimony in the case: the testimony of agents\n\nVelez and Rivera, who claimed to have seen Luciano piloting the speed\n\nboat.    There was no error.\n\nG. Failure to Provide Jury Instruction on Prior Inconsistent\n   Testimony (Lopez-Lopez, Luciano)\n\n           Lopez-Lopez and Luciano argue that the district court erred\n\nby refusing to instruct the jury that it could consider prior testimony\n\nby two government witnesses as substantive evidence on behalf of the\n\nappellants under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(1)(A).8 Lopez-Lopez's argument\n\nis forfeited, as he did not assert it at trial, but we consider the\n\nobjection as to Luciano and conclude that it is without merit.\n\n            Luciano argues that the court should have instructed the\n\njury that agent Velez's prior sworn testimony, concerning the length of\n\nhis observation of the driver of the speed boat at sea, could be\n\nconsidered as substantive evidence under Rule 801(d)(1)(A) rather than\n\n\n     8    Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(1)(A) provides: \"A statement is not\nhearsay if . . . [t]he declarant testifies at the trial . . . and is\nsubject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and the\nstatement is (A) inconsistent with the declarant's testimony, and was\ngiven under oath subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial, hearing,\nor other proceeding . . . .\"\n\n                                 -27-\n\fmerely as impeachment evidence. Second, he argues that agent Padilla's\n\nallegedly prior inconsistent testimony, concerning the circumstances\n\nunder which agents Velez and Rivera later encountered Luciano at the\n\nGuanica station, should have been admitted as substantive evidence\n\nunder that same rule. We review such challenges to jury instructions\n\nfor abuse of discretion. United States v. Smith, 145 F.3d 458, 460\n\n(1st Cir. 1998). We address Luciano's arguments on their terms, but\n\nnote that, even if everything he has argued is true, it remains unclear\n\nthat he is entitled to an instruction telling the jury to consider\n\nevidence that it has heard.     Juries are presumed to consider the\n\nevidence before them and, for this reason, courts do not frequently\n\naccompany particular fragments of the evidence before the jury with\n\nspecial instructions that the evidence may be considered as\n\nsubstantive.\n\n          1. The Velez testimony.\n\n          At the November 19, 1999, suppression hearing, agent Velez\n\ntestified that the time period during which he was able to observe\n\nLuciano at sea -- that is, the elapsed time from when agent Velez\n\nturned on the spotlight to when the drug-importing speed boat rammed\n\ninto the FURA vessel -- was \"maybe two or three seconds.\" He said,\n\nmore generally, that it was \"very fast.\" Defense counsel argues that\n\nthis statement is inconsistent with Velez's testimony at trial that the\n\nsame time period was \"[b]etween five and four seconds\" and that it\n\n\n                                 -28-\n\f\"wasn't more than five seconds.\" After counsel moved to admit the\n\nallegedly inconsistent prior statement as \"substantive evidence\" under\n\nFed. R. Evid. 801(d)(1)(A) and the court deferred its determination of\n\nthe motion, counsel said to Velez: \"Two or three seconds is what it\n\ntook; isn't that so?\" Agent Velez responded by saying \"approximately,\"\n\nnoting that he did not have a watch in his hand at the time of the\n\nincident, and then conceding that it could have been two or three\n\nseconds, as he had said at the suppression hearing. He reiterated that\n\nit all \"happened very quickly.\" The cross-examination then continued\n\non the presumption that two to three seconds was the correct time\n\nestimate.\n\n            Ultimately, the court refused to instruct the jury that\n\nprior inconsistent statements could be used not just to impeach, but as\n\nsubstantive evidence. The court told defense counsel \"I will allow you\n\nto argue anything you want on\" the effect of the evidence and explained\n\nthat defense counsel could develop any arguments he pleased on the\n\nbasis of the discrepancy between the statements.9 Counsel objected.\n\n\n\n     9     Indeed, defense counsel took this opportunity and read and\ncited the transcripts from the previous hearings verbatim. At closing\nargument, defense counsel referred to these statements. For example,\nwith respect to agent Padilla's testimony, defense counsel introduced\nverbatim the only statement that they now claim was not properly\nadmitted; that is, agent Padilla's statement that the identification of\nLuciano by agents Velez and Rivera occurred as Luciano was being\nbrought to them. And counsel was permitted to discuss, as substantive\nfact, all three versions of the identification, and to invite the jury\nto believe any one of them, or none of them.\n\n                                 -29-\n\f          As to Velez's statement, we think Luciano's argument fails\n\nfor a very simple reason. Agent Velez, at trial, adopted his allegedly\n\ninconsistent suppression hearing testimony when he affirmatively stated\n\nthat the correct time could have been two or three seconds rather than\n\nfive seconds. On these facts, there is no Rule 801(d)(1) issue, nor is\n\nthere any hearsay issue at all, and thus there are no grounds for\n\ncounsel to object to the district court's refusal to provide an\n\n801(d)(1) instruction.      See Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(1) advisory\n\ncommittee's note (\"If the witness admits on the stand that he made the\n\nstatement and that it was true, he adopts the statement and there is no\n\nhearsay problem.\"); United States v. Klein, 488 F.2d 481, 483 (2d Cir.\n\n1973); 5 Weinstein's Federal Evidence, supra, at § 801.21[4] (\"If a\n\nwitness, questioned about a prior statement, admits on the stand that\n\nhe or she made the statement and acknowledges that it is true, the\n\nwitness thereby adopts the prior statement as his or her testimony.\n\nThis adoption bypasses the requirements of Rule 801(d)(1) and the\n\nentire hearsay problem.\").\n\n          2. The Padilla testimony.\n\n          At a March 25, 1999, preliminary hearing, agent Padilla\n\ntestified that when he interviewed agents Velez and Rivera, they said\n\nthat they identified Luciano as the speed boat's driver as he was being\n\nbrought to them at the station. At trial, agent Padilla testified that\n\nagents Velez and Rivera told him that they could identify Luciano as\n\n\n                                 -30-\n\fthe boat's captain. Defense counsel presented agent Padilla with his\n\npreliminary hearing transcript statement to refresh his recollection of\n\nhis earlier testimony. Agent Padilla admitted to making the statement\n\nin the transcript.\n\n          On these facts, Luciano's argument again fails. First, the\n\npreliminary hearing statement and the trial statement are not at all\n\ninconsistent, and thus Rule 801(d)(1)(A) does not apply. Second,\n\ndefense counsel did not attempt to introduce agent Padilla's testimony\n\nas substantive evidence; it was admitted, at counsel's direction, to\n\nrefresh agent Padilla's recollection. Luciano may not now argue, for\n\nthe first time on appeal, that it was error not to admit the evidence\n\nfor some other purpose.10\n\nH. Failure to Provide Jury Instruction on the Alien Smuggling\n   Theory (Santana)\n\n          Santana alone claims it was reversible error for the district\n\ncourt to refuse to instruct the jury to acquit if the jury determined\n\nthat Santana was just as likely smuggling aliens as importing cocaine.\n\n\n\n     10    Luciano also argues that agent Padilla's preliminary hearing\ntestimony conflicts with the testimony of agents Velez and Rivera.\nAgents Velez and Rivera testified to having observed Luciano while he\nwas seated in the station, not while he was being brought to them.\nLuciano advances this portion of the argument in one sentence in his\nbrief, but we can dispense with it almost as quickly.              Rule\n801(d)(1)(A) by its terms applies when a declarant testifies at trial\nand that testimony is inconsistent with the declarant's own testimony\nunder oath at a prior proceeding. The rule does not apply where, as\nhere, the declarant's prior statement is inconsistent with the in-court\ntestimony of some other witness.\n\n                                 -31-\n\fWe give plenary review to the question of whether the evidence\n\nadequately supported the requested instruction. United Stated v.\n\nRodriguez, 858 F.2d 809, 812 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\n          At the jury instructions conference, Santana's counsel\n\nrequested a jury instruction stating \"if it's equally probable that\n\ndefendants could have been involved in some alien smuggling venture,\n\nthen you must acquit.\" The district court refused to provide the\n\ninstruction because of insufficient evidence in the record to support\n\nthe alien smuggling theory. The court noted that there was no evidence\n\nto connect Santana to any smuggling ring. Counsel responded by stating\n\nthat \"aliens routinely hide for long periods of time before they start\n\nmoving\" and implied that such hiding occurs in the areas where Santana\n\nwas arrested, but conceded that the evidence for these claims was \"not\n\n. . . in this record.\"\n\n          On the facts, the district court was well within its\n\ndiscretion in finding that the evidence in the record was insufficient\n\nto support a claim that it was equally plausible that Santana was\n\ninvolved in an alien smuggling operation. Although a defendant has a\n\nright to have the jury instructed on his theory of the defense, this\n\nright extends only to those defenses for which there is sufficient\n\nevidentiary support. Mathews v. United States, 485 U.S. 58, 63, 66\n\n(1988); United States v. McGill, 953 F.2d 10, 12 (1st Cir. 1992);\n\nUnited States v. Passos-Paternina, 918 F.2d 979, 984 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n\n                                -32-\n\fThe defendant is not entitled to an instruction on a defense when the\n\nevidence in the record does not support that defense. See generally 2A\n\nC.A. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure § 482, at 346-50 & n.20 (3d\n\ned. 2000).\n\n          Here, although the location where Santana was apprehended may\n\nwell have been one where illegal aliens sometimes entered Puerto Rico,\n\nthere was no evidence in the record connecting Santana to any alien\n\nsmuggling operation. Even considering the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to Santana, there was insufficient evidence to conclude that\n\nhe might have been part of an alien smuggling operation, and thus\n\ninsufficient   evidence   to   warrant   his   proposed   instruction.\n\nFurthermore, the district court permitted the defense to present its\n\nalien smuggling theory at closing, so long as the defense presented it\n\nin a way that did not distort the evidence, thereby further undermining\n\nSantana's claim here.\n\nI. Sufficiency of the Evidence (Lopez-Lopez, Luciano, Santana)\n\n          Lopez-Lopez, Luciano,11 and Santana argue that the evidence\n\non which they were convicted is insufficient and that their convictions\n\nshould therefore be vacated. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a) (\"The court .\n\n\n\n     11    Luciano's argument is unclear because he argues that he\nshould have been acquitted under Fed. R. Crim. P. 29 only in the\ncontext of his claim that the district court should have suppressed\nagent Velez's identification testimony. We give Luciano the benefit of\nthe doubt but nonetheless conclude that the evidence on which he was\nconvicted was sufficient.\n\n                                 -33-\n\f. . shall order the entry of judgment of acquittal . . . if the\n\nevidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction . . . .\"). As we\n\nstated in United States v. Sullivan:\n\n             In assessing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence,\n             we \"review the record to determine whether the evidence and\n             reasonable inferences therefrom, taken as a whole and in the\n             light most favorable to the prosecution, would allow a\n             rational jury to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that\n             the defendants were guilty as charged.\"\n\n85 F.3d 743, 747 (1st Cir. 1996) (quoting United States v. Mena-Robles,\n\n4 F.3d 1026, 1031 (1st Cir. 1993)); see also United States v. Ortiz,\n\n966 F.2d 707, 711 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n             The indictment charged each of the three defendants with (1)\n\npossession with intent to distribute, and aiding and abetting\n\npossession with intent to distribute, 700 kilograms of cocaine, 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(a)(1); 18 U.S.C. § 2, and (2) importation, and aiding and\n\nabetting importation, of 700 kilograms of cocaine, 21 U.S.C. § 952(a);\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2. All three defendants were convicted on both counts of\n\nthe indictment. Thus, on count one, the government had the burden of\n\nproving, with respect to each defendant, the essential elements of the\n\ncrime   of   possession   of   cocaine    with   intent   to   distribute.\n\nSpecifically, the government had to prove \"that the defendant[s]\n\npossessed cocaine, either actually or constructively, that [they] did\n\nso with a specific intent to distribute the cocaine over which [they]\n\nhad actual or constructive possession, and that [they] did so knowingly\n\nand intentionally.\" United States v. Latham, 874 F.2d 852, 863 (1st\n\n                                   -34-\n\fCir. 1989).   On count two, the government had to prove that the\n\ndefendants brought cocaine into the country from international waters\n\nor from airspace in excess of twelve miles outward from the coastline.\n\nUnited States v. Nueva, 979 F.2d 880, 884 (1st Cir. 1992).       \"[N]o\n\npremium is placed on direct as opposed to circumstantial evidence.\"\n\nOrtiz, 966 F.2d at 711.12\n\n          On appeal, our role is to determine whether the jury's\n\nverdict is supported by a plausible rendition of the evidence, not to\n\nweigh the evidence or make credibility judgments that are properly\n\nwithin the purview of the jury. United States v. Tierney, 266 F.3d 37,\n\n40 (1st Cir. 2001). Although this case is a close one with respect to\n\nSantana, we conclude that the evidence, taken as a whole and in the\n\nlight most favorable to the prosecution, would permit a rational jury\n\nto determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants were guilty\n\nas charged.\n\n\n\n\n     12    Appellants all deny that they were the speed boat's\noccupants. No one disputes that the intercepted boat had cocaine on\nboard, or that the boat's occupants were all in possession of the\ncocaine, or that the quantity on board was sufficient to give rise to\nan inference that the boat's occupants intended to distribute the\ncocaine, see Latham, 874 F.2d at 862 (noting \"the doctrine that\npossession of large quantities of drugs justifies the inference that\nthe drugs are for distribution and not personal use\" and citing several\ncases applying this inference), or that the boat imported the cocaine\ninto the country from international waters, or that all of this was\ndone knowingly and intentionally. The only question was whether Lopez-\nLopez, Luciano, and Santana were the boat's occupants.\n\n                                 -35-\n\f          A brief description of the evidence on which appellants were\n\nconvicted is helpful. At trial, the evidence established that three\n\nFURA agents encountered at sea a boat occupied by three people and\n\nabout 700 kilograms of cocaine. The FURA agents successfully captured\n\nthe boat and the cocaine, but the boat's three occupants escaped to a\n\nnearby beach at about 3:00 a.m. Fortunately, agents Velez and Rivera\n\nwere able to get a look at the boat's captain. One hour later, at 4:00\n\na.m., Yauco police officers Alarcon and Cruz, responding to the drug\n\nboat capture, saw three men walking along a rural highway at least two\n\nmiles from where the boat's occupants had last been seen. These three\n\nmen turned out to be the appellants: Lopez-Lopez, Luciano, and Santana.\n\nThe three men ran and hid in a field by the roadside. There, officers\n\nAlarcon and Cruz, together with additional officers from the town of\n\nLajas, apprehended and arrested them. At the time, all three men\n\nappeared damp and exhausted.\n\n          At approximately 6:00 a.m., agents Velez and Rivera arrived\n\nat the station where Lopez-Lopez, Luciano, and Santana were being held.\n\nUpon seeing the three individuals in handcuffs, agents Velez and Rivera\n\nimmediately identified Luciano as the pilot on the boat they had seen\n\nonly a few hours earlier, but neither agent was able to identify\n\nSantana or Lopez-Lopez because neither agent had seen the faces of the\n\nother two men on the boat while at sea.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -36-\n\f          Three weeks later, officer Cruz, accompanied by customs agent\n\nPadilla and others, returned to the field where officers Alarcon and\n\nCruz had found and arrested Lopez-Lopez, Luciano, and Santana. The\n\nagents found several items, including a cellular telephone. Through\n\ntelephone record analysis of the telephone found in the field, it was\n\ndetermined that at 3:27 a.m., on the night the speed boat was\n\napprehended and the three were arrested, a call was placed from the\n\ncellular telephone to a telephone accessible to residents in the\n\nbuilding where Lopez-Lopez resided. Between March 1, 1999, and March\n\n23, 1999, several other calls had been placed from the cellular\n\ntelephone to this building.\n\n          On this evidence, a rational jury could have determined\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Luciano was guilty on both counts.\n\nAgents Velez and Rivera testified that they saw Luciano piloting the\n\nboat full of cocaine. If the jury credited this testimony, then the\n\ngovernment made out a case against Luciano.      So the question, for\n\nLuciano, is simply whether a reasonable jury could have credited this\n\ntestimony.\n\n          Luciano says that agents Velez and Rivera observed the boat's\n\ndriver for only two to three noncontinuous seconds, at a distance of\n\nfifty to sixty feet, in poor light conditions, without ever having seen\n\nthe driver before, while the boat was zig-zagging. A reasonable jury\n\ncould have found that the conditions were not nearly as unfavorable as\n\n\n                                 -37-\n\fLuciano argues. Other evidence showed that the identification was\n\naided by an 800,000 candlepower spotlight, which is sufficient to\n\nrender a dark night as bright as day. The identification was from a\n\ndistance of only about twenty feet and became even closer as the speed\n\nboat approached, and ultimately collided with, the FURA boat. And\n\nagents Velez and Rivera were trained to focus their attention on the\n\npilot in this type of encounter.        A reasonable jury could have\n\nconcluded that this was enough to make a reliable identification of the\n\ncaptain.\n\n           In addition to this direct identification, there was\n\ncircumstantial evidence tending to inculpate Luciano, including\n\nevidence that there were three men on the boat and that he was one in\n\na group of three men found just miles from the boat shortly after the\n\nboat's occupants fled.\n\n           As to Lopez-Lopez, the evidence was also sufficient. The\n\nevidence showed that Lopez-Lopez was found, with two others, walking on\n\na rural road, in the middle of the night, within miles of where a group\n\nof three men had fled a boat loaded with cocaine. Lopez-Lopez was found\n\nwith Luciano, who was identified as the boat's driver. In addition,\n\nLopez-Lopez was linked to the crime through telephone record analysis\n\nof the telephone found in the field. Further, Lopez-Lopez gave an\n\nimprobable account of how he ended up in the field and attempted to\n\nsilence Luciano when the police asked Luciano questions.\n\n\n                                 -38-\n\f          This brings us to Santana. Santana's case is much closer;\n\nalthough his case is on the margin, the evidence was sufficient to\n\nconvict. The evidence linking Santana to the crime is hardly abundant.\n\nThree men escaped from the scene of the crime and Santana was found,\n\nwith two other men, about an hour later and not too far from where the\n\nboat's occupants were last seen. He ran when he saw the police and hid\n\nin a field, which suggests awareness of guilt. Santana was damp and\n\nexhausted, consistent with his having fled the boat and run to where he\n\nwas ultimately caught. \"[T]hat [a defendant's] acts appeared not to be\n\nillegal when viewed in isolation does not bar his conviction.\" Ortiz,\n\n966 F.2d at 714 (quoting United States v. LaChance, 817 F.2d 1491, 1494\n\n(11th Cir. 1987) (second alteration in Ortiz)) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). \"[J]uries are not required to examine the evidence in\n\nisolation, for 'individual pieces of evidence, insufficient in\n\nthemselves to prove a point, may in cumulation prove it. The sum of an\n\nevidentiary presentation may well be greater than its constituent\n\nparts.'\" Id. at 711 (quoting Bourjaily v. United States, 483 U.S. 171,\n\n179-80 (1987)).\n\n          Santana was not only found walking by the side of the road,\n\nin the middle of the night, close in place and time to the crime. He\n\nwas also found with two other men, which matches the number of men seen\n\non the boat. And he was not only found with two other men; he was\n\nfound with Luciano, who was identified by two FURA eye witness as\n\n\n                                 -39-\n\fhaving been the boat's pilot, and with Lopez-Lopez, who was linked to\n\nthe crime through telephone records. This is not a case in which the\n\njury impermissibly convicted a defendant on the basis of innocent\n\nassociation with those involved in illegal activities. Instead, the\n\njury reasonably concluded that Santana, by his own conduct and by his\n\npresence in the company of Lopez-Lopez and Luciano, hiding in a field\n\nin rural Puerto Rico at 4:00 a.m., having just run from the police, was\n\nanything but innocent.     We think this evidence was sufficient.\n\nJ. Apprendi (Lopez-Lopez, Luciano, Santana)\n\n            Lopez-Lopez, Luciano,13 and Santana advance two Apprendi\n\narguments: (1) that their sentences are unconstitutional because they\n\nare based on factors found by the district judge under a preponderance\n\nof the evidence standard rather than on findings made by the jury\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, and (2) that 21 U.S.C. §§ 841 and 95214 --\n\nthe drug laws under which they were sentenced -- are unconstitutional\n\nbecause the laws provide for sentence computations based on factors\n\nfound by the judge rather than by the jury. See Apprendi, 530 U.S.\n\n466.     We reject both claims.\n\n\n\n\n       13 On August 6, 2001, we granted Luciano's motion seeking leave\nto join Santana's Apprendi arguments.\n       14  It is unclear whether appellants challenge § 841 only, or\nboth §§ 841 and 952. We give them the benefit of the doubt by assuming\nthat they challenge both.\n\n                                  -40-\n\f           Ordinarily we would review appellants' objections only for\n\nplain error because they failed to make their arguments to the district\n\ncourt. Olano, 507 U.S. at 731-32; United States v. Robinson, 241 F.3d\n\n115, 119 (1st Cir. 2001). Appellants argue, however, that they could\n\nnot have presented their arguments at sentencing because Apprendi was\n\ndecided on June 26, 2000, only two weeks before the July 10 sentencing\n\nhearing.   Although we reject this as an excuse, we will reach the\n\nmerits of defendants' arguments, which we answer easily.\n\n           1. Sentences.\n\n           There was no error at all. Apprendi's prohibition \"applies\n\nonly when the disputed 'fact' enlarges the applicable statutory maximum\n\nand the defendant's sentence exceeds the original maximum.\" United\n\nStates v. Caba, 241 F.3d 98, 101 (1st Cir. 2001); see also Apprendi,\n\n530 U.S. at 490. Appellants recognize the often-stated view of this\n\ncourt, but invite us to overlook our own (and Supreme Court) precedent\n\nin favor of a much more sweeping view of Apprendi. We decline the\n\ninvitation.\n\n           Here the district judge sentenced each defendant to 235\n\nmonths, which is less than the 240-month statutory maximum sentence for\n\ntrafficking even the smallest quantity of cocaine. See 21 U.S.C. §\n\n841(b)(1)(C) (\"catchall\" provision providing a 240-month maximum). \"No\n\nApprendi violation occurs when the district court sentences a defendant\n\nbelow the default statutory maximum, even though drug quantity,\n\n\n                                 -41-\n\fdetermined by the court under a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard,\n\ninfluences the length of the sentence imposed.\" Robinson, 241 F.3d at\n\n119 (collecting cases). \"Apprendi simply does not apply to guideline\n\nfindings (including . . . drug weight calculations) that increase the\n\ndefendant's sentence, but do not elevate the sentence to a point beyond\n\nthe lowest applicable statutory maximum.\"15 Caba, 241 F.3d at 101; see\n\nalso United States v. Houle, 237 F.3d 71, 80 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n          2. Statutes.\n\n          Next, Lopez-Lopez, Luciano, and Santana argue that, under\n\nApprendi, 21 U.S.C. §§ 841 and 952 are facially unconstitutional\n\nbecause they do not specifically assign the drug quantity determination\n\nto the jury and, in certain controlled substance cases, they expose\n\ndefendants to sentences beyond the lowest maximum sentence based on\n\njudicially-determined factors. In United States v. Valdez-Santana, No.\n\n00-2138, 2002 WL 193088 (1st Cir. Feb. 12, 2002), the court rejected\n\nthis argument on plain error review. Id. at *3. Even bypassing the\n\nproblem of forfeiture, we reject appellants' argument.\n\n          As we noted in Valdez-Santana, id., many courts of appeals\n\nhave found § 841 constitutional although it is silent on who should\n\ndetermine drug quantities. E.g. United States v. Buckland, No. 99-\n\n30285, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 756, at *11 (9th Cir. Jan. 18, 2002) (en\n\n\n     15   This same analysis applies to appellants' hint that the\ndistrict court's determination of their respective roles in the offense\nviolates Apprendi.\n\n                                 -42-\n\fbanc); United States v. Cernobyl, 255 F.3d 1215, 1219 (10th Cir. 2001);\n\nUnited States v. Brough, 243 F.3d 1078, 1079 (7th Cir. 2001). Section\n\n952 is similarly silent.       This does not render the statutes\n\nunconstitutional. The statutes' text does not conflict with Apprendi's\n\nrule and a sentence remains valid so long as there is no Apprendi\n\nviolation in the course of its implementation. Valdez-Santana, No. 00-\n\n2138, 2002 WL 193088, at *3 (upholding § 952); Buckland, No. 99-30285,\n\n2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 756, at *3 & n.1 (collecting cases upholding §\n\n841).\n\nK. Appointment of United States Attorney Guillermo Gil\n   (Lopez-Lopez, Santana)\n\n          Lopez-Lopez and Santana argue that the district court erred\n\nby refusing to allow them access to discovery concerning their\n\nconstitutional challenge to the appointment of United States Attorney\n\nGuillermo Gil. Our decision in United States v. Hilario, 218 F.3d 19\n\n(1st Cir. 2000), is controlling here and it defeats appellants' claim.\n\nSee Valdez-Santana, No. 00-2138, 2002 WL 193088, at *4 (holding that\n\nHilario rejects \"as applied\" challenges to Gil's appointment). Indeed,\n\nSantana concedes that his argument in the district court was identical\n\nto the argument rejected by Hilario.         Appellants' attempt to\n\ndistinguish their as applied challenge from the holding of Hilario is\n\nfruitless. We reject appellants' claim as utterly without merit. We\n\ndiscourage parties in the future from making arguments, such as this\n\none, that this court has already rejected.\n\n                                 -43-\n\f                   III.\n\nThe convictions and sentences are affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                   -44-\n\f",

Three agents were on the patrol boat: Waldy Velez, Pedro Rivera, and Hector Camacho. On their radar, the FURA agents spotted another boat, about a quarter mile out at sea, with its lights off. The FURA boat approached this other boat. When the FURA boat was approximately 25 feet from the boat on radar, the agents shined the FURA boat's two spotlights on the other boat, which both agents Velez and Rivera saw was a speed boat with three men aboard. The speed boat responded by speeding up, colliding with the FURA boat, and then heading on a zig-zag course toward shore. As the speed boat sped away, its occupants started to throw items overboard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A few minutes later, when the speed boat neared the shore-line of Isla Matei, a small uninhabited island off the coast of mainland Puerto Rico, the speed boat's occupants abandoned ship, swam or waded to shore, and then ran onto the island. They were carrying plastic bags. Instead of pursuing the three men, the FURA agents pursued the now unmanned speed boat and gained control of it. They found 700 kilograms of cocaine in the speed boat and in the surrounding sea. The agents also found t-shirts, rain gear, wetsuits, a marine radio, a Global Positioning System (\"GPS\"), a satellite telephone, and a cellular telephone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One hour later, at approximately 4:00 a.m., two police officers of the Yauco narcotics unit, Jose Alarcon and Octavio Cruz, were driving down Highway 324. They had been advised that FURA agents were pursuing a fleeing vessel with a load of drugs, and were headed toward the Phosphorescent Bay area where there might be land crews waiting to assist the drug-carrying boat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On their way to the bay, the Yauco police officers saw three men walking along Highway 324 in a rural area at least two miles from Isla Matei, where the boat's occupants had fled. These three men turned out to be the appellants: Lopez-Lopez, Luciano, and Santana. Officers Alarcon and Cruz did not know that the drug boat had been abandoned, nor did they know that three persons had fled the boat. The three men ran into a field by the roadside and hid. There, officers Alarcon and Cruz apprehended them. Officers Alarcon and Cruz, with the assistance of police officers from the town of Lajas, who had arrived to assist them, arrested the men and took them to the Guanica police station. At the time of their arrest, only Lopez-Lopez spoke, and he stated that he had been robbed and abandoned in the area. All three men appeared damp and exhausted. Only these three were found in the police search of the area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately 6:00 a.m., agents Velez and Rivera &#8212; two of the FURA agents who had encountered and pursued the speed boat &#8212; arrived at the Guanica station. Lopez-Lopez, Luciano, and Santana were being held in a central area on the first floor of the small, two-story structure. Upon seeing the three men in handcuffs, agents Velez and Rivera immediately identified Luciano as the pilot of the speed boat, but the agents did not identify Lopez-Lopez or Santana. Neither a lineup nor a photographic display was ever conducted. The agents later conducted ion and fiber tests of the three men and their clothing in order to detect the presence of cocaine or fibers from the bales recovered from the speed boat. All of the tests returned negative results.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three weeks later, Yauco police officer Cruz, accompanied by customs agent Ismael Padilla and other agents, returned to the site of the earlier arrests. The purpose of their visit to the field was for officer Cruz to show agent Padilla where the arrests occurred, not to gather evidence. Although no evidence was found in the field at the time the three were arrested, this time the agents found several items, including a cellular telephone and a bag containing money and two wallets. None of the wallets contained identification of the defendants. Through telephone record analysis of the telephone found in the field, it was determined that, at 3:27 a.m. on the night the speed boat was apprehended and the defendants were arrested, a call was placed from the cellular telephone to a telephone accessible to residents in the building where Lopez-Lopez lived.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lopez-Lopez, Luciano, and Santana were indicted on two counts: (1) possession with intent to distribute, and aiding and abetting possession with intent to distribute, 700 kilograms of cocaine, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1); 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2, and (2) importation, and aiding and abetting importation, of 700 kilograms of cocaine, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 952(a); 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2. After a month-long jury trial, the three defendants were convicted on both counts. At sentencing, the district court determined in separate proceedings that, given the nature of the offenses and the amount of cocaine involved, each defendant's base offense level was 38. Given a criminal history category of I, the district court found that the guidelines imprisonment range was 235 to 293 months. On July 10, 2000, the trial judge sentenced each defendant to 235 months in prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

Unlawful Arrest (Lopez-Lopez)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lopez-Lopez argues that the district court erred by refusing to suppress all evidence obtained from his arrest, as well as the arrests of Luciano and Santana,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> all of which he alleges were without probable cause. Lopez-Lopez concedes that he did not raise the unlawful arrest argument in the district court and that it is therefore forfeited. Nonetheless, he argues that under <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993), there was a plain error affecting substantial rights and, accordingly, this court should provide relief. We treat his argument as waived under Rule 12(f) rather than as forfeited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b) requires that motions to suppress be raised prior to trial. Rule 12(f) provides that a \"[f]ailure by a party\" to so move \"shall constitute waiver.\" A court may \"grant relief from the waiver\" if a party shows cause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Fed. R.Crim.P. 12(f). Lopez-Lopez did not move to suppress the fruits of the allegedly unlawful arrests prior to trial and so his argument is waived under Rule 12(f). <i>United States v. Bashorun,</i> 225 F.3d 9, 13 (1st Cir.2000); <i>United States v. Torres,</i> 162 F.3d 6, 10-11 (1st Cir.1998). Lopez-Lopez has not even attempted to offer an explanation for his failure to move to suppress. He has not shown cause for relief and so his argument is waived. Fed.

The argument has been waived and he has shown no cause for relief. The district court record is insufficiently developed, due to Lopez-Lopez's own failure to raise the issue, to permit reliable appellate review. <i>United States v. Nu&#241;ez,</i> 19 F.3d 719, 722, 723 n. 10 (1st Cir.1994); <i>see also Torres,</i> 162 F.3d at 11 n. 2 (plain error review doctrine inapplicable where defendant has failed to develop factual record related to his suppression argument).

All three object only to the identification of Luciano, as agents Velez and Rivera never identified Lopez-Lopez or Santana. Appellants argue that the show-up of Luciano to agents Velez and Rivera created a substantial likelihood of misidentification in violation of the Due Process Clause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Specifically, Luciano appeals the district court's refusal to suppress evidence that at the Guanica station, about two and one-half hours after pursuing the speed boat at sea and observing the boat's driver, agents Velez and Rivera identified Luciano as the driver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The findings of the district court after a hearing on a pretrial motion to suppress are binding on this court unless they are clearly erroneous. <i>United States v. de Jesus-Rios,</i> 990 F.2d 672, 677 (1st Cir.1993). These findings determine the outcome here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pretrial identification evidence is subject to constitutional limitations under the Due Process Clause. <i>Stovall v.

Brathwaite,</i> 432 U.S. 98, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 53 L.Ed.2d 140 (1977)). We employ a two-pronged analysis to determine whether evidence of a pretrial identification should be suppressed. <i>Watson,</i> 76 F.3d at 6. \"First, the court must determine whether the procedure was impermissibly suggestive.\" <i>Id.</i> If so, then the court \"must decide whether the identification itself was reliable under the totality of the circumstances, notwithstanding the suggestive procedure.\" <i>Id.</i> The likelihood of misidentification must be very strong in order to suppress the evidence. <i>Id.; de Jesus-Rios,</i> 990 F.2d at 677.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is little basis to overturn the district court's conclusion that the procedure was not impermissibly suggestive. This conclusion eliminates Luciano's due process argument. <i>Watson,</i> 76 F.3d at 6. The facts, as found by the district court, were that, after a long night, agents Velez and Rivera returned to the Guanica station unaware that specific people had been arrested. On entering the station, the officers did not anticipate seeing detainees suspected of operating the speed boat, but the officers saw the three detainees, who were being held downstairs because of the station's small size and upstairs offices. Both officers immediately, spontaneously, and without being prompted, identified Luciano as the speed boat's pilot. These facts do not make for an impermissibly suggestive show-up.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luciano attempts to undermine the spontaneity of the identification by pointing to three separate stories told about the identification. <i>Cf. Jackson v. Fogg,</i> 589 F.2d 108 (2d Cir.1978) (affirming district court's grant of habeas where conviction was based solely on questionable identification procedures). But the district court rejected Luciano's alternative view of the facts and found \"no evidence whatsoever that the identification happened in any other form than the spontaneous form in which the agents testified.\" We cannot say that this conclusion was unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luciano also attempts to undercut the spontaneity of the identification by arguing that the police could easily have used less suggestive identification procedures and that there was no good reason for allowing the detainees to sit on the first floor of the Guanica station where agents Velez and Rivera might easily see them. But the first part of this argument assumes that an identification was intentionally contemplated by the Guanica police. The district court found that at the time the identification occurred, the officers in the Guanica station were not attempting to undertake an identification; the detainees were simply sitting downstairs. The government concedes that it did not attempt less suggestive identification procedures, such as a lineup. But, as the district court concluded, \"there was no need for a lineup\" after the officers immediately identified Luciano. The second part of Luciano's argument is that the police should not have detained the suspects downstairs, where anyone walking in could see them. No doubt the Guanica police might have been more careful. But the detainees were downstairs because the Guanica station is a small, two-story building and it was not unreasonable to opt against holding the suspects upstairs where the administrative offices are located. These circumstances do not support Luciano's theory that this was all a setup.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. Lopez-Lopez's Post-Arrest Statement (Lopez-Lopez, Luciano)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lopez-Lopez and Luciano allege that the district court committed reversible error at trial when it denied their objection to suppress evidence of a statement Lopez-Lopez made at the Guanica station. Lopez-Lopez told Luciano \"don't answer\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> when Luciano was asked whether he knew anything about a shipment that had been seized. The district court permitted officer Juan Arevalo-Echevarria, a sergeant in the Yauco drugs division, to testify that Lopez-Lopez had told Luciano to remain silent. Both Lopez-Lopez and Luciano now argue that officer Arevalo's testimony constituted improper comment on their rights to remain silent, in violation of their Fifth Amendment rights. Luciano also argues that the testimony violated the rule of <i>Bruton v. United States,</i> 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), which prohibits admission of testimony by a nontestifying defendant inculpating a codefendant in a joint trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first claim, that the admission of Lopez-Lopez's statement telling Luciano not to answer violated both defendants' Fifth Amendment rights, we first note the general prohibition established in <i>Doyle v. Ohio,</i> 426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976). Subject to certain exceptions, admission of evidence of a defendant's post-arrest silence, after <i>Miranda</i> warnings have been provided, to impeach an explanation a defendant offers at trial, violates a defendant's Due Process rights. <i>Id.</i> at 618-19, 96 S.Ct. 2240. Lopez-Lopez and Luciano say that Lopez-Lopez's statement to Luciano fits the pattern governed by <i>Doyle.</i> Lopez-Lopez and Luciano characterize Lopez-Lopez's direction to Luciano, telling him \"don't answer,\" as reminding Luciano of his legal right, under <i>Miranda,</i> to remain silent. They argue that Lopez-Lopez's reminder to Luciano of Luciano's right, and Luciano's exercise of his right to remain silent upon being reminded, are being used against both of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Doyle</i> argument fails because their post-<i>Miranda</i> silence was not used against them at trial. Officer Arevalo testified about what Lopez-Lopez said, not as to the silence of either defendant. There was no testimony as to whether Luciano responded to Lopez-Lopez's suggestion by remaining silent and there was no testimony about either party remaining silent in the face of questioning. That what Lopez-Lopez said involved a statement about not saying anything does not put the statement into the category of post-<i>Miranda</i> silence upon which comment is impermissible. When an accused is given his <i>Miranda</i> rights, and then waives those rights by voluntarily making statements, he may not rely on <i>Doyle</i> to object to the admission of those statements simply because the statements refer to the act of keeping silent. <i>Cf. United States v. Harris,</i> 956 F.2d 177, 181 (8th Cir.1992) (holding that it is permissible to admit testimony that the accused ceased to answer questions once the accused initially begins answering questions).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Bruton</i> argument also fails. The argument goes like this. When, in a joint trial, a statement is admitted of a defendant confessing to a crime and implicating a codefendant, the codefendant may be deprived of his Confrontation Clause rights by being unable to force the confessing defendant to take the stand and be cross-examined (due to the confessing defendant's Fifth Amendment rights). <i>Bruton,</i> 391 U.S. at 137, 88 S.Ct. 1620. In such situations, a limiting instruction that the jury should consider the statement only as to the confessing defendant may be inadequate to protect the implicated codefendant. <i>Id.</i> The theory here is that Lopez-Lopez's statement telling Luciano not to answer tends to incriminate them both and is sufficiently like a confession to warrant <i>Bruton</i> protection. We agree that it tends to be incriminating, but that does not answer the question of whether it is within <i>Bruton</i>'s scope.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The challenged testimony here does not fall within <i>Bruton,</i> as that rule has developed. The statement \"don't answer\" is not a confession. As we recently noted in <i>Brown v. Maloney,</i> 267 F.3d 36 (1st Cir. 2001), <i>Bruton</i> does not necessarily apply, if indeed it ever applies, when such statements are involved. <i>Id.</i> at 41-42. We need not resolve this ambiguity because Lopez-Lopez's statement is not sufficiently close to a confession: that is, it is not powerfully incriminating. <i>See United States v. Smith,</i> 46 F.3d 1223, 1227-28 (1st Cir.1995) (noting <i>Bruton</i>'s requirement of \"express[]\" and \"powerful[]\" implication); <i>Richardson v. Marsh,</i> 481 U.S. 200, 208, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 95 L.Ed.2d 176 (1987) (holding that <i>Bruton</i> applies when a nontestifying defendant's statement \"expressly implicat[es]\" a codefendant, leaving no doubt that it would be \"powerfully incriminating\") (quoting <i>Bruton,</i> 391 U.S. at 124 n. 1, 135, 88 S.Ct. 1620). The argument that the statement was of an \"incriminatory nature\" is insufficient to clear the hurdle requiring a powerfully incriminating statement. <i>Cf. Brown,</i> 267 F.3d at 42 (holding that it was reasonable for a state court to conclude that <i>Bruton</i> did not apply in the absence of powerfully incriminating evidence). Lopez-Lopez's \"don't answer\" statement did not even mention any person or any crime or any criminal responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, Luciano asked for neither a severance nor a limiting instruction. Of course, in a true <i>Bruton</i> confession situation, a limiting instruction would not cure the harm. 391 U.S. at 135-37, 88 S.Ct. 1620. But Luciano's failure to even ask for a limiting instruction is a fair gauge for measuring the lack of harm to Luciano from the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">E.

The parties agree that agent Jim&#233;nez was not in any way involved in the investigation of this case. The government characterizes the testimony as \"expert\" or \"quasi-expert\" and says that it offered it to explain to the jury the modus operandi of individuals importing drugs into Puerto Rico and the tools of that unlawful trade. Agent Jim&#233;nez testified about how drug importation schemes use GPS to facilitate air drops and boat-to-boat transfers, and about how cellular telephones are used to enable boat-to-ground communication. The evidence was relevant because a GPS and a cellular telephone were found on the speed boat in this case and a cellular telephone was later found in the field where the three were arrested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants attack on several fronts. They say that, under <i>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,</i> 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993), and <i>Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael,</i> 526 U.S. 137, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999), the district court failed to apply the correct standard for admitting expert testimony. They also characterize the drug importation scheme as \"plain vanilla\" and argue that expert testimony was unnecessary to help the jurors understand a type of criminal operation with which the jurors are \"familiar.\" Furthermore, they argue that agent Jim&#233;nez was incompetent to testify. Fed.R.Evid. 601. Finally, they argue that under Fed.R.Evid. 403 the evidence's \"probative value [was] substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice\" and so the district court should have excluded the evidence. We review for abuse of discretion the district court's decision to admit this expert testimony. <i>United States v. Sebaggala,</i> 256 F.3d 59, 66 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the wrong standard argument, <i>Daubert,</i> as amplified in <i>Kumho Tire,</i> simply requires that the trial judge, under the Federal Rules of Evidence, ensure that an expert's testimony \"both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.\" <i>Daubert,</i> 509 U.S. at 597, 113 S.Ct. 2786, <i>quoted in Kumho Tire,</i> 526 U.S. at 141, 119 S.Ct. 1167; <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Evid. 702 &amp; advisory committee's note (amended in response to <i>Daubert</i> and <i>Kumho Tire</i>). As <i>Daubert</i> stated, and <i>Kumho Tire</i> reaffirmed, the test for reliability is \"flexible\" and \"<i>Daubert</i>'s list of specific factors neither necessarily nor exclusively applies to all experts or in every case.\" <i>Kumho Tire,</i> 526 U.S. at 141-42, 119 S.Ct. 1167; <i>see also</i> Fed.R.Evid. 702 advisory committee's note (stating that the <i>Daubert</i> factors are not \"exclusive [or] dispositive\"). Furthermore, \"the law grants a district court the same broad latitude when it decides <i>how</i> to determine reliability as it enjoys in respect to its ultimate reliability determination.\" <i>Kumho Tire,</i> 526 U.S. at 142, 119 S.Ct. 1167.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both defense counsel and the district court were apprised of the government's proposal to introduce agent Jim&#233;nez's expert testimony. There is no reason to believe that the district court somehow failed to perform its gatekeeping function: outside of the presence of the jury, the district court heard defense counsel's objections to the expert testimony and the government's proffer. The court found that agent Jim&#233;nez's testimony was based on his experience with how GPS and cellular telephones are used in drug operations. That the court acted as gatekeeper is evident from its decision to sharply constrain agent Jim&#233;nez's testimony. The court permitted him to testify where it believed his testimony was relevant and helpful, for example, to explain the meaning of GPS coordinates found on the boat and to explain the range of cellular telephones at sea, but refused to allow him to testify where it thought the evidence was not relevant or helpful, for example, to explain the presence of raincoats and wetsuits on the boat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next is the claim that the expert testimony was improper because it related to subjects that the jurors could understand without such testimony. A district court may admit expert testimony if it finds that \"specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\" Fed.R.Evid. 702. The district court has \"considerable latitude\" in deciding whether expert testimony will be helpful to the jury. <i>Sebaggala,</i> 256 F.3d at 65. We are mindful that \"[t]he trial judge has a hands-on familiarity with the nuances of the case &#8212; nuances which may not survive transplantation into a cold appellate record.\" <i>United States v. Hoffman,</i> 832 F.2d 1299, 1310 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the trial judge determined that agent Jim&#233;nez's testimony would help the jury understand the role of a GPS and cellular telephones in marine drug importation schemes. Appellants have made no reasoned argument to support the claim that GPS, GPS coordinates, their level of accuracy, nautical charts, marine navigation, and the role of all of these things in drug smuggling operations are common knowledge. Nor is there any evidence that cellular telephones, their ranges at sea, and their role in smuggling operations are within the typical juror's common knowledge. It is well established that, in drug cases, the government may call expert witnesses to testify about criminal modus operandi when such testimony would be helpful to the jury. \"We have admitted expert testimony regarding the operation of criminal schemes and activities in a variety of contexts, finding such testimony helpful to juries in understanding some obscure or complex aspect of the crime.\" <i>United States v. Montas,</i> 41 F.3d 775, 783 (1st Cir.1994); <i>see also United States v. Hensel,</i> 699 F.2d 18, 38 (1st Cir. 1983) (upholding admission of testimony about drug smugglers' methods because \"smuggling tons of marijuana is a complex matter\" and thus expert testimony would help the jury); <i>accord United States v. Brown,</i> 776 F.2d 397, 400 (2d Cir.1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants also argue that agent Jim&#233;nez was incompetent to testify under Fed.R.Evid. 601. They argue that the government, under the guise of presenting expert testimony, presented prohibited lay opinion testimony regarding a matter of which agent Jim&#233;nez had no personal knowledge. Again, we disagree. The district court cabined agent Jim&#233;nez's testimony, as already described. Agent Jim&#233;nez is a Customs Service agent. He was a marine enforcement officer charged with interdicting suspected vessels entering Puerto Rican waters. He spent fourteen years as an electronic technician with the Air Force and he is an FCC-licensed radio operator. He has a degree in electrical engineering and has unique knowledge &#8212; about GPS, cellular telephones, and the logistics of marine drug importation &#8212; gained through infiltrating organizations attempting to smuggle large quantities of cocaine into Puerto Rico. These factors persuade us that the district court was well within its discretion when it found agent Jim&#233;nez competent to testify as an expert.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants' best and final argument is that, under Fed.R.Evid. 403, the evidence's \"probative value [was] substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\" \"Even if admissible under Rule 702, expert testimony still may be excluded under Fed.R.Evid. 403 if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice it creates.\" <i>Montas,</i> 41 F.3d at 783. If a cellular telephone had not been found in the field as well as on the boat, appellants would have a better argument. The question at trial was not whether there was a drug conspiracy (to which the GPS and cellular telephone on the boat went), but rather whether these defendants were the drug conspirators. The cellular telephone in the field went to the identity question of whether these defendants were the ones associated with the drug boat. In this context, the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the probative value of the evidence outweighed any prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">F.

They say the demonstrative evidence was misleading and lacking in probative value. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 403.

Agent Rivera demonstrated the spotlight by turning it on in court under controlled conditions. The light was turned on for a period approximating the two to three second period during which agents Velez and Rivera testified they witnessed Luciano on the night the speed boat was apprehended.

Second, he argues that agent Padilla's allegedly prior inconsistent testimony, concerning the circumstances under which agents Velez and Rivera later encountered Luciano at the Guanica station, should have been admitted as substantive evidence under that same rule. We review such challenges to jury instructions for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Smith,</i> 145 F.3d 458, 460 (1st Cir.1998). We address Luciano's arguments on their terms, but note that, even if everything he has argued is true, it remains unclear that he is entitled to an instruction telling the jury to consider evidence that it has heard. Juries are presumed to consider the evidence before them and, for this reason, courts do not frequently accompany particular fragments of the evidence before the jury with special instructions that the evidence may be considered as substantive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The Velez testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the November 19, 1999, suppression hearing, agent Velez testified that the time period during which he was able to observe Luciano at sea &#8212; that is, the elapsed time from when agent Velez turned on the spotlight to when the drug-importing speed boat rammed into the FURA vessel &#8212; was \"maybe two or three seconds.\" He said, more generally, that it was \"very fast.\" Defense counsel argues that this statement is inconsistent with Velez's testimony at trial that the same time period was \"[b]etween five and four seconds\" and that it \"wasn't more than five seconds.\" After counsel moved to admit the allegedly inconsistent prior statement as \"substantive evidence\" under Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(1)(A) and the court deferred its determination of the motion, counsel said to Velez: \"Two or three seconds is what it took; isn't that so?\" Agent Velez responded by saying \"approximately,\" noting that he did not have a watch in his hand at the time of the incident, and then conceding that it could have been two or three seconds, as he had said at the suppression hearing. He reiterated that it all \"happened very quickly.\" The cross-examination then continued on the presumption that two to three seconds was the correct time estimate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, the court refused to instruct the jury that prior inconsistent statements could be used not just to impeach, but as substantive evidence. The court told defense counsel \"I will allow you to argue anything you want on\" the effect of the evidence and explained that defense counsel could develop any arguments he pleased on the basis of the discrepancy between the statements.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Counsel objected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Velez's statement, we think Luciano's argument fails for a very simple reason. Agent Velez, at trial, adopted his allegedly inconsistent suppression hearing testimony when he affirmatively stated that the correct time could have been two or three seconds rather than five seconds. On these facts, there is no Rule 801(d)(1) issue, nor is there any hearsay issue at all, and thus there are no grounds for counsel to object to the district court's refusal to provide an 801(d)(1) instruction. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Evid. 801(d)(1) advisory committee's note (\"If the witness admits on the stand that he made the statement and that it was true, he adopts the statement and there is no hearsay problem.\"); <i>United States v.

At trial, agent Padilla testified that agents Velez and Rivera told him that they could identify Luciano as the boat's captain. Defense counsel presented agent Padilla with his preliminary hearing transcript statement to refresh his recollection of his earlier testimony.

First, the preliminary hearing statement and the trial statement are not at all inconsistent, and thus Rule 801(d)(1)(A) does not apply. Second, defense counsel did not attempt to introduce agent Padilla's testimony as substantive evidence; it was admitted, at counsel's direction, to refresh agent Padilla's recollection. Luciano may not now argue, for the first time on appeal, that it was error not to admit the evidence for some other purpose.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">H.

We give plenary review to the question of whether the evidence adequately supported the requested instruction. <i>United States v. Rodriguez,</i> 858 F.2d 809, 812 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the jury instructions conference, Santana's counsel requested a jury instruction stating \"if it's equally probable that defendants could have been involved in some alien smuggling venture, then you must acquit.\" The district court refused to provide the instruction because of insufficient evidence in the record to support the alien smuggling theory. The court noted that there was no evidence to connect Santana to any smuggling ring. Counsel responded by stating that \"aliens routinely hide for long periods of time before they start moving\" and implied that such hiding occurs in the areas where Santana was arrested, but conceded that the evidence for these claims was \"not ... in this record.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the facts, the district court was well within its discretion in finding that the evidence in the record was insufficient to support a claim that it was equally plausible that Santana was involved in an alien smuggling operation. Although a defendant has a right to have the jury instructed on his theory of the defense, this right extends only to those defenses for which there is sufficient evidentiary support. <i>Mathews v. United States,</i> 485 U.S. 58, 63, 66, 108 S.Ct. 883, 99 L.Ed.2d 54 (1988); <i>United States v. McGill,</i> 953 F.2d 10, 12 (1st Cir.1992); <i>United States v. Passos-Paternina,</i> 918 F.2d 979, 984 (1st Cir. 1990). The defendant is not entitled to an instruction on a defense when the evidence in the record does not support that defense. <i>See generally</i> 2A C.A.

Even considering the evidence in the light most favorable to Santana, there was insufficient evidence to conclude that he might have been part of an alien smuggling operation, and thus insufficient evidence to warrant his proposed instruction. Furthermore, the district court permitted the defense to present its alien smuggling theory at closing, so long as the defense presented it in a way that did not distort the evidence, thereby further undermining Santana's claim here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I.

All three defendants were convicted on both counts of the indictment. Thus, on count one, the government had the burden of proving, with respect to each defendant, the essential elements of the crime of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. Specifically, the government had to prove \"that the defendant[s] possessed cocaine, either actually or constructively, that [they] did so with a specific intent to distribute the cocaine over which [they] had actual or constructive possession, and that [they] did so knowingly and intentionally.\" <i>United States v.

Although this case is a close one with respect to Santana, we conclude that the evidence, taken as a whole and in the light most favorable to the prosecution, would permit a rational jury to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants were guilty as charged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A brief description of the evidence on which appellants were convicted is helpful. At trial, the evidence established that three FURA agents encountered at sea a boat occupied by three people and about 700 kilograms of cocaine. The FURA agents successfully captured the boat and the cocaine, but the boat's three occupants escaped to a nearby beach at about 3:00 a.m. Fortunately, agents Velez and Rivera were able to get a look at the boat's captain. One hour later, at 4:00 a.m., Yauco police officers Alarcon and Cruz, responding to the drug boat capture, saw three men walking along a rural highway at least two miles from where the boat's occupants had last been seen. These three men turned out to be the appellants: Lopez-Lopez, Luciano, and Santana. The three men ran and hid in a field by the roadside. There, officers Alarcon and Cruz, together with additional officers from the town of Lajas, apprehended and arrested them. At the time, all three men appeared damp and exhausted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately 6:00 a.m., agents Velez and Rivera arrived at the station where Lopez-Lopez, Luciano, and Santana were being held. Upon seeing the three individuals in handcuffs, agents Velez and Rivera immediately identified Luciano as the pilot on the boat they had seen only a few hours earlier, but neither agent was able to identify Santana or Lopez-Lopez because neither agent had seen the faces of the other two men on the boat while at sea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three weeks later, officer Cruz, accompanied by customs agent Padilla and others, returned to the field where officers Alarcon and Cruz had found and arrested Lopez-Lopez, Luciano, and Santana. The agents found several items, including a cellular telephone. Through telephone record analysis of the telephone found in the field, it was determined that at 3:27 a.m., on the night the speed boat was apprehended and the three were arrested, a call was placed from the cellular telephone to a telephone accessible to residents in the building where Lopez-Lopez resided. Between March 1, 1999, and March 23, 1999, several other calls had been placed from the cellular telephone to this building.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this evidence, a rational jury could have determined beyond a reasonable doubt that Luciano was guilty on both counts. Agents Velez and Rivera testified that they saw Luciano piloting the boat full of cocaine. If the jury credited this testimony, then the government made out a case against Luciano. So the question, for Luciano, is simply whether a reasonable jury could have credited this testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luciano says that agents Velez and Rivera observed the boat's driver for only two to three noncontinuous seconds, at a distance of fifty to sixty feet, in poor light conditions, without ever having seen the driver before, while the boat was zig-zagging. A reasonable jury could have found that the conditions were not nearly as unfavorable as Luciano argues. Other evidence showed that the identification was aided by an 800,000 candlepower spotlight, which is sufficient to render a dark night as bright as day. The identification was from a distance of only about twenty feet and became even closer as the speed boat approached, and ultimately collided with, the FURA boat. And agents Velez and Rivera were trained to focus their attention on the pilot in this type of encounter. A reasonable jury could have concluded that this was enough to make a reliable identification of the captain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to this direct identification, there was circumstantial evidence tending to inculpate Luciano, including evidence that there were three men on the boat and that he was one in a group of three men found just miles from the boat shortly after the boat's occupants fled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Lopez-Lopez, the evidence was also sufficient. The evidence showed that Lopez-Lopez was found, with two others, walking on a rural road, in the middle of the night, within miles of where a group of three men had fled a boat loaded with cocaine. Lopez-Lopez was found with Luciano, who was identified as the boat's driver. In addition, Lopez-Lopez was linked to the crime through telephone record analysis of the telephone found in the field. Further, Lopez-Lopez gave an improbable account of how he ended up in the field and attempted to silence Luciano when the police asked Luciano questions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to Santana. Santana's case is much closer; although his case is on the margin, the evidence was sufficient to convict. The evidence linking Santana to the crime is hardly abundant. Three men escaped from the scene of the crime and Santana was found, with two other men, about an hour later and not too far from where the boat's occupants were last seen. He ran when he saw the police and hid in a field, which suggests awareness of guilt. Santana was damp and exhausted, consistent with his having fled the boat and run to where he was ultimately caught. \"[T]hat [a defendant's] acts appeared not to be illegal when viewed in isolation does not bar his conviction.\" <i>Ortiz,</i> 966 F.2d at 714 (quoting <i>United States v. LaChance,</i> 817 F.2d 1491, 1494 (11th Cir.1987) (second alteration in <i>Ortiz</i>)) (internal quotation marks omitted). \"[J]uries are not required to examine the evidence in isolation, for `individual pieces of evidence, insufficient in themselves to prove a point, may in cumulation prove it. The sum of an evidentiary presentation may well be greater than its constituent parts.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 711 (quoting <i>Bourjaily v. United States,</i> 483 U.S. 171, 179-80, 107 S.Ct. 2775, 97 L.Ed.2d 144 (1987)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santana was not <i>only</i> found walking by the side of the road, in the middle of the night, close in place and time to the crime. He was also found with two other men, which matches the number of men seen on the boat. And he was not only found with two other men; he was found with Luciano, who was identified by two FURA eye witness as having been the boat's pilot, and with Lopez-Lopez, who was linked to the crime through telephone records. This is not a case in which the jury impermissibly convicted a defendant on the basis of innocent association with those involved in illegal activities. Instead, the jury reasonably concluded that Santana, by his own conduct and by his presence in the company of Lopez-Lopez and Luciano, hiding in a field in rural Puerto Rico at 4:00 a.m., having just run from the police, was anything but innocent.

In <i>United States v. Valdez-Santana,</i> 279 F.3d 143 (1st Cir.2002), the court rejected this argument on plain error review. <i>Id.</i> at 146. Even bypassing the problem of forfeiture, we reject appellants' argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we noted in <i>Valdez-Santana, id.,</i> many courts of appeals have found &#167; 841 constitutional although it is silent on who should determine drug quantities. <i>E.g. United States v. Buckland,</i> 277 F.3d 1173 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc); <i>United States v. Cernobyl,</i> 255 F.3d 1215, 1219 (10th Cir. 2001); <i>United States v. Brough,</i> 243 F.3d 1078, 1079 (7th Cir.2001). Section 952 is similarly silent. This does not render the statutes unconstitutional. The statutes' text does not conflict with <i>Apprendi</i>'s rule and a sentence remains valid so long as there is no <i>Apprendi</i> violation in the course of its implementation. <i>Valdez-Santana,</i> at 146 (upholding &#167; 952); <i>Buckland,</i> 277 F.3d at 1176 &amp; n. 1 (collecting cases upholding &#167; 841).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">K.

Our decision in <i>United States v.

Indeed, Santana concedes that his argument in the district court was identical to the argument rejected by <i>Hilario.</i> Appellants' attempt to distinguish their as applied challenge from the holding of <i>Hilario</i> is fruitless.

Three agents were on the patrol boat: Waldy Velez, Pedro Rivera, and Hector Camacho. On their radar, the FURA agents spotted another boat, about a quarter mile out at sea, with its lights off. The FURA boat approached this other boat. When the FURA boat was approximately 25 feet from the boat on radar, the agents shined the FURA boat's two spotlights on the other boat, which both agents Velez and Rivera saw was a speed boat with three men aboard. The speed boat responded by speeding up, colliding with the FURA boat, and then heading on a zig-zag course toward shore. As the speed boat sped away, its occupants started to throw items overboard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A few minutes later, when the speed boat neared the shore-line of Isla Matei, a small uninhabited island off the coast of mainland Puerto Rico, the speed boat's occupants abandoned ship, swam or waded to shore, and then ran onto the island. They were carrying plastic bags. Instead of pursuing the three men, the FURA agents pursued the now unmanned speed boat and gained control of it. They found 700 kilograms of cocaine in the speed boat and in the surrounding sea. The agents also found t-shirts, rain gear, wetsuits, a marine radio, a Global Positioning System (\"GPS\"), a satellite telephone, and a cellular telephone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One hour later, at approximately 4:00 a.m., two police officers of the Yauco narcotics unit, Jose Alarcon and Octavio Cruz, were driving down Highway 324. They had been advised that FURA agents were pursuing a fleeing vessel with a load of drugs, and were headed toward the Phosphorescent Bay area where there might be land crews waiting to assist the drug-carrying boat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On their way to the bay, the Yauco police officers saw three men walking along Highway 324 in a rural area at least two miles from Isla Matei, where the boat's occupants had fled. These three men turned out to be the appellants: Lopez-Lopez, Luciano, and Santana. Officers Alarcon and Cruz did not know that the drug boat had been abandoned, nor did they know that three persons had fled the boat. The three men ran into a field by the roadside and hid. There, officers Alarcon and Cruz apprehended them. Officers Alarcon and Cruz, with the assistance of police officers from the town of Lajas, who had arrived to assist them, arrested the men and took them to the Guanica police station. At the time of their arrest, only Lopez-Lopez spoke, and he stated that he had been robbed and abandoned in the area. All three men appeared damp and exhausted. Only these three were found in the police search of the area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately 6:00 a.m., agents Velez and Rivera &#8212; two of the FURA agents who had encountered and pursued the speed boat &#8212; arrived at the Guanica station. Lopez-Lopez, Luciano, and Santana were being held in a central area on the first floor of the small, two-story structure. Upon seeing the three men in handcuffs, agents Velez and Rivera immediately identified Luciano as the pilot of the speed boat, but the agents did not identify Lopez-Lopez or Santana. Neither a lineup nor a photographic display was ever conducted. The agents later conducted ion and fiber tests of the three men and their clothing in order to detect the presence of cocaine or fibers from the bales recovered from the speed boat. All of the tests returned negative results.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three weeks later, Yauco police officer Cruz, accompanied by customs agent Ismael Padilla and other agents, returned to the site of the earlier arrests. The purpose of their visit to the field was for officer Cruz to show agent Padilla where the arrests occurred, not to gather evidence. Although no evidence was found in the field at the time the three were arrested, this time the agents found several items, including a cellular telephone and a bag containing money and two wallets. None of the wallets contained identification of the defendants. Through telephone record analysis of the telephone found in the field, it was determined that, at 3:27 a.m. on the night the speed boat was apprehended and the defendants were arrested, a call was placed from the cellular telephone to a telephone accessible to residents in the building where Lopez-Lopez lived.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lopez-Lopez, Luciano, and Santana were indicted on two counts: (1) possession with intent to distribute, and aiding and abetting possession with intent to distribute, 700 kilograms of cocaine, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1); 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2, and (2) importation, and aiding and abetting importation, of 700 kilograms of cocaine, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 952(a); 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2. After a month-long jury trial, the three defendants were convicted on both counts. At sentencing, the district court determined in separate proceedings that, given the nature of the offenses and the amount of cocaine involved, each defendant's base offense level was 38. Given a criminal history category of I, the district court found that the guidelines imprisonment range was 235 to 293 months. On July 10, 2000, the trial judge sentenced each defendant to 235 months in prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

This conclusion eliminates Luciano's due process argument. <i>Watson,</i> 76 F.3d at 6. The facts, as found by the district court, were that, after a long night, agents Velez and Rivera returned to the Guanica station unaware that specific people had been arrested. On entering the station, the officers did not anticipate seeing detainees suspected of operating the speed boat, but the officers saw the three detainees, who were being held downstairs because of the station's small size and upstairs offices. Both officers immediately, spontaneously, and without being prompted, identified Luciano as the speed boat's pilot. These facts do not make for an impermissibly suggestive show-up.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luciano attempts to undermine the spontaneity of the identification by pointing to three separate stories told about the identification. <i>Cf.

But the district court rejected Luciano's alternative view of the facts and found \"no evidence whatsoever that the identification happened in any other form than the spontaneous form in which the agents testified.\" We cannot say that this conclusion was unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luciano also attempts to undercut the spontaneity of the identification by arguing that the police could easily have used less suggestive identification procedures and that there was no good reason for allowing the detainees to sit on the first floor of the Guanica station where agents Velez and Rivera might easily see them. But the first part of this argument assumes that an identification was intentionally contemplated by the Guanica police. The district court found that at the time the identification occurred, the officers in the Guanica station were not attempting to undertake an identification; the detainees were simply sitting downstairs. The government concedes that it did not attempt less suggestive identification procedures, such as a lineup. But, as the district court concluded, \"there was no need for a lineup\" after the officers immediately identified Luciano. The second part of Luciano's argument is that the police should not have detained the suspects downstairs, where anyone walking in could see them. No doubt the Guanica police might have been more careful. But the detainees were downstairs because the Guanica station is a small, two-story building and it was not unreasonable to opt against holding the suspects upstairs where the administrative offices are located. These circumstances do not support Luciano's theory that this was all a setup.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D.

Lopez-Lopez told Luciano \"don't answer\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> when Luciano was asked whether he knew anything about a shipment that had been seized. The district court permitted officer Juan Arevalo-Echevarria, a sergeant in the Yauco drugs division, to testify that Lopez-Lopez had told Luciano to remain silent. Both Lopez-Lopez and Luciano now argue that officer Arevalo's testimony constituted improper comment on their rights to remain silent, in violation of their Fifth Amendment rights. Luciano also argues that the testimony violated the rule of <i>Bruton v.

Ohio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109491\"><a href=\"/opinion/109491/doyle-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">610</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109491\"><a href=\"/opinion/109491/doyle-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></a></span> (1976). Subject to certain exceptions, admission of evidence of a defendant's post-arrest silence, after <i>Miranda</i> warnings have been provided, to impeach an explanation a defendant offers at trial, violates a defendant's Due Process rights. <i>Id.</i> at 618-19, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109491\"><a href=\"/opinion/109491/doyle-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2240</span></a></span>. Lopez-Lopez and Luciano say that Lopez-Lopez's statement to Luciano fits the pattern governed by <i>Doyle.</i> Lopez-Lopez and Luciano characterize Lopez-Lopez's direction to Luciano, telling him \"don't answer,\" as reminding Luciano of his legal right, under <i>Miranda,</i> to remain silent. They argue that Lopez-Lopez's reminder to Luciano of Luciano's right, and Luciano's exercise of his right to remain silent upon being reminded, are being used against both of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Doyle</i> argument fails because their post-<i>Miranda</i> silence was not used against them at trial. Officer Arevalo testified about what Lopez-Lopez said, not as to the silence of either defendant. There was no testimony as to whether Luciano responded to Lopez-Lopez's suggestion by remaining silent and there was no testimony about either party remaining silent in the face of questioning. That what Lopez-Lopez said involved a statement about not saying anything does not put the statement into the category of post-<i>Miranda</i> silence upon which comment is impermissible. When an accused is given his <i>Miranda</i> rights, and then waives those rights by voluntarily making statements, he may not rely on <i>Doyle</i> to object to the admission of those statements simply because the statements refer to the act of keeping silent. <i>Cf. United States v. Harris,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577243\"><a href=\"/opinion/577243/united-states-v-leslie-gordon-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">956</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">177</span></a></span>, 181 (8th Cir.1992) (holding that it is permissible to admit testimony that the accused ceased to answer questions once the accused initially begins answering questions).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Bruton</i> argument also fails. The argument goes like this. When, in a joint trial, a statement is admitted of a defendant confessing to a crime and implicating a codefendant, the codefendant may be deprived of his Confrontation Clause rights by being unable to force the confessing defendant to take the stand and be cross-examined (due to the confessing defendant's Fifth Amendment rights). <i>Bruton,</i> 391 U.S. at 137, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107684\"><a href=\"/opinion/107684/bruton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1620</span></a></span>. In such situations, a limiting instruction that the jury should consider the statement only as to the confessing defendant may be inadequate to protect the implicated codefendant. <i>Id.</i> The theory here is that Lopez-Lopez's statement telling Luciano not to answer tends to incriminate them both and is sufficiently like a confession to warrant <i>Bruton</i> protection. We agree that it tends to be incriminating, but that does not answer the question of whether it is within <i>Bruton</i>'s scope.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The challenged testimony here does not fall within <i>Bruton,</i> as that rule has developed. The statement \"don't answer\" is not a confession. As we recently noted in <i>Brown v. Maloney,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199630\"><a href=\"/opinion/199630/brown-v-maloney/\"><span class=\"volume\">267</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 2001), <i>Bruton</i> does not necessarily apply, if indeed it ever applies, when such statements are involved. <i>Id.</i> at 41-42. We need not resolve this ambiguity because Lopez-Lopez's statement is not sufficiently close to a confession: that is, it is not powerfully incriminating. <i>See United States v.

The argument that the statement was of an \"incriminatory nature\" is insufficient to clear the hurdle requiring a powerfully incriminating statement. <i>Cf. Brown,</i> 267 F.3d at 42 (holding that it was reasonable for a state court to conclude that <i>Bruton</i> did not apply in the absence of powerfully incriminating evidence).

There is no reason to believe that the district court somehow failed to perform its gatekeeping function: outside of the presence of the jury, the district court heard defense counsel's objections to the expert testimony and the government's proffer. The court found that agent Jim&#233;nez's testimony was based on his experience with how GPS and cellular telephones are used in drug operations. That the court acted as gatekeeper is evident from its decision to sharply constrain agent Jim&#233;nez's testimony. The court permitted him to testify where it believed his testimony was relevant and helpful, for example, to explain the meaning of GPS coordinates found on the boat and to explain the range of cellular telephones at sea, but refused to allow him to testify where it thought the evidence was not relevant or helpful, for example, to explain the presence of raincoats and wetsuits on the boat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next is the claim that the expert testimony was improper because it related to subjects that the jurors could understand without such testimony.

The district court has \"considerable latitude\" in deciding whether expert testimony will be helpful to the jury. <i>Sebaggala,</i> 256 F.3d at 65.

Nor is there any evidence that cellular telephones, their ranges at sea, and their role in smuggling operations are within the typical juror's common knowledge. It is well established that, in drug cases, the government may call expert witnesses to testify about criminal modus operandi when such testimony would be helpful to the jury. \"We have admitted expert testimony regarding the operation of criminal schemes and activities in a variety of contexts, finding such testimony helpful to juries in understanding some obscure or complex aspect of the crime.\" <i>United States v.

They argue that the government, under the guise of presenting expert testimony, presented prohibited lay opinion testimony regarding a matter of which agent Jim&#233;nez had no personal knowledge. Again, we disagree. The district court cabined agent Jim&#233;nez's testimony, as already described. Agent Jim&#233;nez is a Customs Service agent. He was a marine enforcement officer charged with interdicting suspected vessels entering Puerto Rican waters. He spent fourteen years as an electronic technician with the Air Force and he is an FCC-licensed radio operator. He has a degree in electrical engineering and has unique knowledge &#8212; about GPS, cellular telephones, and the logistics of marine drug importation &#8212; gained through infiltrating organizations attempting to smuggle large quantities of cocaine into Puerto Rico.

If a cellular telephone had not been found in the field as well as on the boat, appellants would have a better argument. The question at trial was not whether there was a drug conspiracy (to which the GPS and cellular telephone on the boat went), but rather whether these defendants were the drug conspirators. The cellular telephone in the field went to the identity question of whether these defendants were the ones associated with the drug boat.

We address Luciano's arguments on their terms, but note that, even if everything he has argued is true, it remains unclear that he is entitled to an instruction telling the jury to consider evidence that it has heard.

He reiterated that it all \"happened very quickly.\" The cross-examination then continued on the presumption that two to three seconds was the correct time estimate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, the court refused to instruct the jury that prior inconsistent statements could be used not just to impeach, but as substantive evidence.

On these facts, there is no Rule 801(d)(1) issue, nor is there any hearsay issue at all, and thus there are no grounds for counsel to object to the district court's refusal to provide an 801(d)(1) instruction. <i>See</i> Fed.

At trial, the evidence established that three FURA agents encountered at sea a boat occupied by three people and about 700 kilograms of cocaine. The FURA agents successfully captured the boat and the cocaine, but the boat's three occupants escaped to a nearby beach at about 3:00 a.m. Fortunately, agents Velez and Rivera were able to get a look at the boat's captain. One hour later, at 4:00 a.m., Yauco police officers Alarcon and Cruz, responding to the drug boat capture, saw three men walking along a rural highway at least two miles from where the boat's occupants had last been seen. These three men turned out to be the appellants: Lopez-Lopez, Luciano, and Santana. The three men ran and hid in a field by the roadside. There, officers Alarcon and Cruz, together with additional officers from the town of Lajas, apprehended and arrested them. At the time, all three men appeared damp and exhausted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately 6:00 a.m., agents Velez and Rivera arrived at the station where Lopez-Lopez, Luciano, and Santana were being held. Upon seeing the three individuals in handcuffs, agents Velez and Rivera immediately identified Luciano as the pilot on the boat they had seen only a few hours earlier, but neither agent was able to identify Santana or Lopez-Lopez because neither agent had seen the faces of the other two men on the boat while at sea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three weeks later, officer Cruz, accompanied by customs agent Padilla and others, returned to the field where officers Alarcon and Cruz had found and arrested Lopez-Lopez, Luciano, and Santana. The agents found several items, including a cellular telephone. Through telephone record analysis of the telephone found in the field, it was determined that at 3:27 a.m., on the night the speed boat was apprehended and the three were arrested, a call was placed from the cellular telephone to a telephone accessible to residents in the building where Lopez-Lopez resided. Between March 1, 1999, and March 23, 1999, several other calls had been placed from the cellular telephone to this building.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this evidence, a rational jury could have determined beyond a reasonable doubt that Luciano was guilty on both counts. Agents Velez and Rivera testified that they saw Luciano piloting the boat full of cocaine. If the jury credited this testimony, then the government made out a case against Luciano. So the question, for Luciano, is simply whether a reasonable jury could have credited this testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Luciano says that agents Velez and Rivera observed the boat's driver for only two to three noncontinuous seconds, at a distance of fifty to sixty feet, in poor light conditions, without ever having seen the driver before, while the boat was zig-zagging. A reasonable jury could have found that the conditions were not nearly as unfavorable as Luciano argues. Other evidence showed that the identification was aided by an 800,000 candlepower spotlight, which is sufficient to render a dark night as bright as day. The identification was from a distance of only about twenty feet and became even closer as the speed boat approached, and ultimately collided with, the FURA boat. And agents Velez and Rivera were trained to focus their attention on the pilot in this type of encounter. A reasonable jury could have concluded that this was enough to make a reliable identification of the captain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to this direct identification, there was circumstantial evidence tending to inculpate Luciano, including evidence that there were three men on the boat and that he was one in a group of three men found just miles from the boat shortly after the boat's occupants fled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Lopez-Lopez, the evidence was also sufficient. The evidence showed that Lopez-Lopez was found, with two others, walking on a rural road, in the middle of the night, within miles of where a group of three men had fled a boat loaded with cocaine. Lopez-Lopez was found with Luciano, who was identified as the boat's driver. In addition, Lopez-Lopez was linked to the crime through telephone record analysis of the telephone found in the field. Further, Lopez-Lopez gave an improbable account of how he ended up in the field and attempted to silence Luciano when the police asked Luciano questions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to Santana. Santana's case is much closer; although his case is on the margin, the evidence was sufficient to convict. The evidence linking Santana to the crime is hardly abundant. Three men escaped from the scene of the crime and Santana was found, with two other men, about an hour later and not too far from where the boat's occupants were last seen. He ran when he saw the police and hid in a field, which suggests awareness of guilt. Santana was damp and exhausted, consistent with his having fled the boat and run to where he was ultimately caught. \"[T]hat [a defendant's] acts appeared not to be illegal when viewed in isolation does not bar his conviction.\" <i>Ortiz,</i> 966 F.2d at 714 (quoting <i>United States v.

He was also found with two other men, which matches the number of men seen on the boat. And he was not only found with two other men; he was found with Luciano, who was identified by two FURA eye witness as having been the boat's pilot, and with Lopez-Lopez, who was linked to the crime through telephone records. This is not a case in which the jury impermissibly convicted a defendant on the basis of innocent association with those involved in illegal activities. Instead, the jury reasonably concluded that Santana, by his own conduct and by his presence in the company of Lopez-Lopez and Luciano, hiding in a field in rural Puerto Rico at 4:00 a.m., having just run from the police, was anything but innocent.

Little turns on this waiver, however, because the district court properly admitted the identification evidence.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Lopez-Lopez went on to say \"we don't know anything about the shipment,\" but that statement was not introduced at trial</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Lopez-Lopez, in one sentence of his brief, attempts to adopt Luciano's<i>Bruton</i> argument. But <i>Bruton</i> is unavailable to Lopez-Lopez because Lopez-Lopez is the declarant and the statement is therefore admissible against him.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(1)(A) provides: \"A statement is not hearsay if ... [t]he declarant testifies at the trial ... and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and the statement is (A) inconsistent with the declarant's testimony, and was given under oath subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial, hearing, or other proceeding ....\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Indeed, defense counsel took this opportunity and read and cited the transcripts from the previous hearings verbatim. At closing argument, defense counsel referred to these statements. For example, with respect to agent Padilla's testimony, defense counsel introduced verbatim the only statement that they now claim was not properly admitted; that is, agent Padilla's statement that the identification of Luciano by agents Velez and Rivera occurred as Luciano was being brought to them. And counsel was permitted to discuss, as substantive fact, all three versions of the identification, and to invite the jury to believe any one of them, or none of them</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Luciano also argues that agent Padilla's preliminary hearing testimony conflicts with the testimony of agents Velez and Rivera. Agents Velez and Rivera testified to having observed Luciano while he was seated in the station, not while he was being brought to them. Luciano advances this portion of the argument in one sentence in his brief, but we can dispense with it almost as quickly. Rule 801(d)(1)(A) by its terms applies when a declarant testifies at trial and that testimony is inconsistent with the declarant's own testimony under oath at a prior proceeding. The rule does not apply where, as here, the declarant's prior statement is inconsistent with the in-court testimony of some other witness</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> Luciano's argument is unclear because he argues that he should have been acquitted under Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 only in the context of his claim that the district court should have suppressed agent Velez's identification testimony. We give Luciano the benefit of the doubt but nonetheless conclude that the evidence on which he was convicted was sufficient</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> Appellants all deny that they were the speed boat's occupants. No one disputes that the intercepted boat had cocaine on board, or that the boat's occupants were all in possession of the cocaine, or that the quantity on board was sufficient to give rise to an inference that the boat's occupants intended to distribute the cocaine,<i>see Latham,</i> 874 F.2d at 862 (noting \"the doctrine that possession of large quantities of drugs justifies the inference that the drugs are for distribution and not personal use\" and citing several cases applying this inference), or that the boat imported the cocaine into the country from international waters, or that all of this was done knowingly and intentionally. The only question was whether Lopez-Lopez, Luciano, and Santana were the boat's occupants.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> On August 6, 2001, we granted Luciano's motion seeking leave to join Santana's<i>Apprendi</i> arguments.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> It is unclear whether appellants challenge &#167; 841 only, or both &#167;&#167; 841 and 952. We give them the benefit of the doubt by assuming that they challenge both</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> This same analysis applies to appellants' hint that the district court's determination of their respective roles in the offense violates<i>Apprendi.</i></p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
