(\"Cambridge\") has filed\na petition for writ of mandamus asking this court to direct the\ndistrict court to approve a proffered statement, pursuant to\nFed. R. App. P. 10(c) (\"Rule 10(c) Statement\"). Mandamus is an\nextraordinary remedy requiring \"(1) a showing of some special\nrisk of irreparable harm, and (2) a demonstration of clear\nentitlement to the relief requested, i.e., that the district\ncourt's order is palpably erroneous.\"       Bennett v. City of\nBoston, 54 F.3d 18, 21 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n     To the extent that the district court declined to approve\nthe Rule 10(c) Statement on the ground that, as a general\nprinciple, Rule 10(c) does not apply to an informal pretrial\nconference, that contention appears incorrect. See Athridge v.\nRivas, 141 F.3d 357 (D.C. Cir. 1998); see also Rogan v. Menino,\n175 F.3d 75, 79 (1st Cir.) (discussing a Rule 10(c) statement\napproved by a district court judge that recited what had been\nsaid at an unrecorded chambers conference), cert. denied, 528\nU.S. 1062 (1999); Barilaro v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 876 F.2d\n260, 263 (1st Cir. 1989) (suggesting that appellant should have\nutilized Rule 10(c) to memorialize what had occurred at a\npretrial conference).    Nonetheless, this error, in and of\nitself, does not entitle Cambridge to a writ of mandamus.\n\n     Unlike Athridge, in which the failure to resolve what had\noccurred at the unrecorded conference precluded consideration of\n\fa dispositive appellate issue, Cambridge has made no such\nshowing here.     Cambridge's mandamus petition argues that,\ncontrary to the district court's contention, there is a material\ndispute of fact regarding the activities of sales representative\nSchwab on behalf of the defendants and that, at the unrecorded\nconference, it sought leave to depose Schwab on these matters.\nHowever, the district court determined that it lacked personal\njurisdiction over the defendants because Cambridge's cause of\naction involves proof of its copyright claim and that cause of\naction is not established by Cambridge's proffered evidence that\nthe defendants conducted business in Massachusetts. In other\nwords, the district court assumed that the defendants'\nactivities sufficed for the \"transacting business\" clause of the\nlong-arm statute but concluded that Cambridge had failed to\ndemonstrate that its cause of action arose from these business\nactivities.   Cambridge's allegation that there is a dispute\nabout the scope and extent of Schwab's activities on behalf of\nthe defendants and its complaint that it was foreclosed at the\nunrecorded conference from pursuing its deposition of Schwab\ntherefore appears off-point.\n\n     Similarly, Cambridge has not demonstrated how the district\ncourt's refusal to approve its Rule 10(c) Statement prejudices\nits presentation of a claim that the district court failed to\naddress its contention that the court had general, as well as\nspecific, personal jurisdiction.1 The Rule 10(c) Statement did\nnot add anything to the issue of general personal jurisdiction\nwhen the district court, in fact, accepted, for purposes of its\ndecision, that the defendants' business contacts constituted the\ntransaction of business in Massachusetts.\n\n     Accordingly, because Cambridge has not shown that its\nproffered Rule 10(c) Statement has relevance to its pending\nappeal, it has not demonstrated \"some special risk of\nirreparable harm\" and \"palpable\" error by the district court in\nrefusing to approve it.\n\n    The petition for writ of mandamus is denied.\n\n                                      By the Court:\n\n                                      Janice Oâ€™Neil, Acting Clerk.\n\n\n    1For    purposes of disposing of this petition for writ of\nmandamus,   we assume, without deciding, that Cambridge's failure\nto move     for reconsideration after entry of the order of\ndismissal   did not constitute a waiver of this claim.\n\fBy: Julie Gregg,\n    Appeals Attorney.\n\f",
