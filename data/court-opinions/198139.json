Appellants Larry and\r\nKathleen H. reside in Mansfield, Massachusetts with Daniel H.,\r\ntheir son.  Daniel is a child with disabilities within the meaning\r\nof the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20\r\nU.S.C.  1400-1485.  When Daniel's parents and the Mansfield\r\npublic school system were unable to agree on the services to be\r\nprovided Daniel, the parents removed him from the public school,\r\nunilaterally enrolled him in the Learning Prep School (LPS) and\r\nrequested a hearing with the Massachusetts Bureau of Special\r\nEducation Appeals (BSEA).  Following the hearings, the BSEA ruled\r\nin favor of the Mansfield School Committee (Mansfield), finding\r\nthat with some modifications to their program, Mansfield was and is\r\ncapable of meeting the child's needs, LPS was overly restrictive,\r\nand the parents were not entitled to be reimbursed for the LPS\r\nexpenses.  Appellants then sought judicial review in district\r\ncourt, which upheld the BSEA's decision and denied their\r\napplication for attorneys' fees.  They now appeal from the judgment\r\nof the district court.  We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\r\n1331, and we affirm.\r\n                        OVERVIEW\r\nThe IDEA was enacted to ensure that all children with disabilities\r\nreceive a \"free appropriate public education [FAPE] . . . designed\r\nto meet their unique needs.\"  20 U.S.C.  1400(c).  \"While a state\r\nmay not depart downward from the minimum level of appropriateness\r\nmandated under federal law, 'a state is free to exceed, both\r\nsubstantively and procedurally, the protection and services to be\r\nprovided to its disabled children.'\"  Roland M. v. Concord Sch.\r\nComm., 910 F.2d 983, 987 (1st Cir. 1990) (quoting Burlington v. \r\nDepartment of Educ., 736 F.2d 773, 784-85 (1st Cir. 1984)\r\n(\"Burlington II\")).  Massachusetts has chosen a higher standard: \r\nThe Department of Education is required to administer programs that\r\n\"'assure the maximum possible development of a child with special\r\nneeds.'\"  Stock v. Massachusetts Hosp. Sch., 392 Mass. 205, 211,\r\n467 N.E.2d 448, 453 (1984) (quoting Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 71B  2);\r\nsee also Roland M., 910 F.2d at 987; David D. v. Dartmouth Sch.\r\nComm., 775 F.2d 411, 423 (1st Cir. 1985). \r\n     The FAPE is implemented through an individual education\r\nplan (IEP), a written statement that sets out an educational\r\nprogram to meet the particularized needs of a child with\r\ndisabilities.  20 U.S.C.  1301(a)(20).  In Massachusetts, an IEP\r\nfor a child is developed by TEAM, a group of individuals including\r\n\"the parents, the child's teacher, designated specialists, and a\r\nrepresentative of the [local education agency].\"  Roland M., 910\r\nF.2d at 988.  The IEP must be reviewed annually and revised when\r\nnecessary.  See id.\r\n     Parents who are dissatisfied with their child's IEP can\r\npresent a complaint and obtain a due process hearing to resolve the\r\nproblem.  See 20 U.S.C.  1415(b)(1)(E) &amp; (2).  In Massachusetts,\r\nthis function is performed by the BSEA.  See Roland M., 910 F.2d at\r\n987.  During the pendency of proceedings under  1415, the child is\r\nto \"remain in the then current educational placement.\"  20 U.S.C.\r\n1415(e)(3).  If the school district cannot provide the FAPE\r\nitself, it can recommend that the child be placed in a private\r\nfacility at no cost to the parents.  See 34 C.F.R.  300.401(a)(2). \r\nHowever, parents who \"'unilaterally change their child's placement\r\nduring the pendency of review proceedings, without the consent of\r\nstate or local school officials,' . . . are entitled to\r\nreimbursement only if . . . the public placement violated IDEA and\r\n[] the private school placement was proper under the Act.\" \r\nFlorence County Sch. Dist. Four v. Carter, 510 U.S. 7, 15, 114\r\nS. Ct. 361, 366, 126 L. Ed. 2d 284 (1993) (quoting School Comm. v. Department of Educ., 471 U.S. 359, 373-74, 105 S. Ct. 1996, 2004-\r\n05, 85 L. Ed. 2d 385 (1985)).  \r\n     Judicial review of the decision of the BSEA presents a\r\ntwo-fold inquiry:  Whether the state has complied with the\r\nprocedures of the Act, and whether the IEP developed through those\r\nprocedures is \"reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive\r\neducational benefits.\"  Board of Educ. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176,\r\n206-07, 102 S. Ct. 3034, 3051, 73 L. Ed. 2d 690 (1982).  The Act\r\nimposes procedural requirements upon state and local education\r\nagencies to \"assure that children with disabilities and their\r\nparents . . . are guaranteed procedural safeguards with respect to\r\nthe provision of free appropriate public education.\"  20 U.S.C.\r\n1415(a).  \"The primary safeguard is the obligatory development of\r\nan individualized education program (IEP).\"  Roland M., 910 F.2d at\r\n987 (citing Rowley, 458 U.S. at 181).  The IEP must contain\r\n\"statements about the child's current performance, long-term and\r\nshort-term instructional targets, and objective criteria for\r\nmeasuring the student's advance.\"  Id. (citing 20 U.S.C.  1401(19)\r\nand 34 C.F.R.  300.346); see also Rowley, 458 U.S. at 206 n.27. \r\nAnd, as noted, a school's programs must \"assure the maximum\r\npossible development of a child with special needs,\" subject to the\r\nAct's preference for \"mainstreaming,\" i.e., educating handicapped\r\nchildren and non-handicapped children together \"to the maximum\r\nextent appropriate\" and providing special education in \"the least\r\nrestrictive environment.\"  Id. (citing 20 U.S.C.  1412(5) and 34\r\nC.F.R.  300.552(d)).  \r\n             FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n     Daniel H. suffers from a language-based learning\r\ndisorder.  From kindergarten through the sixth grade, Daniel\r\nattended Mansfield public schools.  In the first, second and third\r\ngrades, Daniel received special education services in accordance\r\nwith his IEP with a 502.4 prototype.  In the fourth grade,\r\nDaniel's TEAM modified his IEP to a 502.3 prototype, and he was\r\nmainstreamed for mathematics.  In the fifth grade, Daniel was\r\nmainstreamed in all content areas after he successfully completed\r\nthe Stevenson Reading and Literature Program, a special education\r\ncurriculum, in accordance with his 1992-93 IEP.\r\nIn 1993, before Daniel entered the sixth grade, TEAM\r\ndetermined that a 502.1 program would provide him with the least\r\nrestrictive appropriate educational environment.  The 1993-94 IEP\r\nproposed that Daniel participate in a regular education program,\r\nwith one-half hour per week of speech and language monitoring and \r\nuse of a notebook to exchange information between the home and the\r\nschool.  Daniel's parents deferred their approval of the IEP until\r\nthey could obtain an independent evaluation of Daniel by the New\r\nEngland Medical Center (NEMC).\r\nNEMC evaluated Daniel in November 1993 and Daniel's\r\nmother gave a copy of the evaluation to Mansfield school officials. \r\nNEMC determined that Daniel had difficulties processing auditory\r\ninformation, retrieving words, and formulating sentences.  He\r\nperformed below average on reading and language tests but scored\r\nwell in mathematics.  NEMC recommended small group speech therapy\r\nas well as weekly consultations between a speech pathologist and\r\nDaniel's classroom teacher.  \r\nAround the same time, Daniel began having several\r\nproblems.  Academically, Daniel's mother felt that he was\r\nstruggling with his homework because it often took him three to\r\nfour hours to complete.  Socially, he incurred several disciplinary\r\ninfractions for fighting with other students and he began\r\ndefecating in his pants.  As a result, Kathleen H. arranged for\r\nDaniel to be counseled by a psychologist.\r\nAfter receiving NEMC's evaluation, Kathleen H. asked TEAM\r\nto modify the 1993-94 IEP to incorporate NEMC's recommendations. \r\nTEAM met in December 1993 and rewrote the IEP to reflect the\r\nspecial services that Daniel was then actually receiving, which\r\nincluded thirteen forty-minute support periods each week in the\r\nmainstream classroom, but refused to formally adopt NEMC's\r\nrecommendations.  In turn, Daniel's parents rejected the modified\r\nIEP on January 2, 1994.  On February 7, 1994, the school offered to\r\nsupplement Daniel's special education program by providing small\r\ngroup speech and language services twice a week, to fund regular\r\nconsultations between NEMC evaluators and Mansfield personnel, and\r\nto provide Daniel with a homework organization sheet to supplement\r\nhis notebook.  Daniel's parents never responded to this offer.\r\nTEAM met again in March 1994, to prepare Daniel's seventh\r\ngrade IEP.  The 1994-95 IEP proposed a 502.2 prototype program\r\nconsisting of the thirteen forty-minute support periods per week in\r\nthe mainstream classroom he was then receiving, supplemented by two\r\nforty-minute periods of speech and language instruction and\r\nconsultation to Daniel's classroom teachers by the speech and\r\nlanguage providers.  Attached to the IEP were NEMC's\r\nrecommendations which Mansfield would implement \"where\r\nappropriate,\" and Mansfield offered to fund consultations between\r\nDaniel's teacher and NEMC evaluators.  Daniel's parents rejected\r\nthe proposed IEP on March 31, 1994, and enrolled Daniel at LPS for\r\nthe 1994-95 school year.  \r\nDaniel's parents then appealed to the BSEA.  Following\r\nhearings, the hearing officer issued her decision.  Her salient\r\nfindings were that (1) with some modifications, Mansfield is and\r\nwas capable of meeting Daniel's needs; (2) while Mansfield made\r\nprocedural errors in the 1993-94 and 1994-95 IEPs, they did not\r\nrise to the level of noncompliance; (3) LPS was overly restrictive;\r\nand (4) the parents should not be reimbursed for the LPS expenses\r\nincurred during the 1994-95 period.  The hearing officer found that\r\ngiven Daniel's progress during his first five years, it was\r\nreasonable for Mansfield to place him in an integrated class. \r\nHowever, she faulted Mansfield for placing too much emphasis on\r\nDaniel's classroom performance as an evaluation tool and agreed\r\nwith appellants that the special services provided Daniel in the\r\nsixth grade were insufficient to maximize his potential.  She\r\nlisted several technical deficiencies in the IEPs:  (1) They failed\r\nto specify Daniel's current level of performance and his learning\r\nstyle; (2) they failed to provide sufficient criteria for measuring\r\nhis achievement; (3) they failed to specify one-on-one instruction\r\nin speech and language skills and individualized counseling on\r\nissues associated with adolescence; and (4) they failed to gather\r\nall this relevant information before writing Daniel's sixth grade\r\nIEP.  Nevertheless, she found, that Mansfield had not acted in bad\r\nfaith and that the IEPs lack of specificity did not deny Daniel\r\nsubstantive services.  And she concluded, \"The procedural mistakes\r\nin the writing of the IEP are not grave enough to assume that\r\n[Mansfield] lacks the capacity to develop or implement a special\r\neducation program for Daniel.\"\r\nDaniel's parents then sought judicial review.  The\r\ndistrict court upheld the BSEA decision, finding that (1)\r\nappellants had failed to show that the 1993-94 and 1994-95 IEPs\r\nwere not adequate and appropriate for Daniel, and (2) the drafting\r\ndeficiencies were matters of form rather than substance and do not\r\nimpeach the results actually achieved.  Because it found that\r\nDaniel thrived in the mainstream experience and Mansfield was\r\nwilling and able to provide the further help he needed, it held\r\nthat Daniel's parents were not entitled to recover the cost of\r\nenrolling Daniel in LPS.  Finally, the court determined that\r\nDaniel's parents were not prevailing parties, and therefore not\r\nentitled to recover their attorneys' fees and costs.\r\n                       DISCUSSION\r\nI.   BSEA DECISION\r\nA.   Standard of Review\r\n\"The ultimate question for a court under the Act is\r\nwhether a proposed IEP is adequate and appropriate for a particular\r\nchild at a given point in time.\"  Burlington II, 736 F.2d at 788. \r\nThe district court's resolution of that question is a mixed\r\nquestion of law and fact that we review for clear error \"[a]bsent\r\na showing that the wrong legal rule was employed.\"  Roland M., 910\r\nF.2d at 990.  We \"accept a district court's resolution of questions\r\nanent adequacy and appropriateness of an IEP so long as the court's\r\nconclusions are not clearly erroneous on the record as a whole.\" \r\nId. at 990-91. \r\nB.   Merits\r\nAppellants contend that the district court erred in\r\nconcluding that the IEPs were adequate and appropriate to maximize\r\nDaniel's development in the least restrictive environment and claim\r\nthe court's decision is unsupported by the record.  They fail,\r\nhowever, to demonstrate clear error.\r\nWith regard to the 1993-94 IEP, appellants claim that the\r\ncourt erred in finding that Daniel made encouraging progress in the\r\nregular classroom in the first through fifth grades.  They allege\r\nthat Daniel \"was being taught in a resource room outside of the\r\nregular education classroom\" during these years, and that the court\r\n\"totally ignored the facts contained in the record regarding\r\nDaniel's lack of progress during the sixth grade.\"  The court's\r\nfinding was based on the detailed findings of the hearing officer\r\nwho reached the same conclusion.  Its review was appropriately\r\n\"thorough yet deferential.\"  Roland M., 910 F.2d at 989. \r\nAppellants have failed to demonstrate that the court committed\r\nerror.\r\nWith respect to the 1994-95 IEP, appellants contend that\r\nthe court erred in finding that the changes ordered by the hearing\r\nofficer simply gave a more accurate account of the services Daniel\r\nhad actually received.  The hearing officer ordered Mansfield to\r\nadopt certain NEMC recommendations regarding increased speech and\r\nlanguage instruction, small-group reading and writing instruction,\r\nand bi-weekly counseling.  She also found, however, that with\r\nproper accommodations, Daniel's needs can be met at Mansfield,\r\nwhich is the least restrictive environment for him.  And she\r\nconcluded that Mansfield's procedural errors did not rise to the\r\nlevel of noncompliance.    Thus, even if the IEP was initially\r\ndeficient, our focus in assessing its adequacy is on the IEP as it\r\nemerges from the administrative review process.  See Roland M., 910\r\nF.2d at 988; see also Amann v. Stow Sch. Sys., 982 F.2d 644, 650-51\r\n(1st Cir. 1992) (IEP adequate and appropriate even though hearing\r\nofficer ordered modifications).  We discern no error.   \r\nAppellants also rest their argument on the IEP proposed\r\nfor 1995-96, pointing out that its recommendation to place Daniel\r\nin a 502.4 prototype program (as opposed to the 502.2 prototype in\r\nthe 1994-95 IEP) contradicts the court's findings.  Under the\r\nIDEA's scheme, however, an IEP must be reviewed annually and\r\nrevised when necessary.  The fact that Mansfield revised Daniel's\r\nIEP between the 1994-95 and the 1995-96 school years is not\r\nevidence that the IEP for the previous year was inadequate.\r\nWe conclude that appellants have failed to demonstrate\r\nclear error in the district court's ruling that the IEPs were\r\nadequate and appropriate.  See Burlington II, 736 F.2d at 794\r\n(parents bear burden of proving IEP's inadequacy); see also Amann,\r\n982 F.2d at 650 (same).  As we stated in Roland M., \"[b]efore an\r\nIEP is set aside, there must be some rational basis to believe that\r\nprocedural inadequacies compromised the pupil's right to an\r\nappropriate education, seriously hampered the parents' opportunity\r\nto participate in the formulation process, or caused a deprivation\r\nof educational benefits.\"  910 F.2d at 994.  The district court was\r\nsatisfied that appellants' showing failed to meet that test and we\r\nsee no clear error in its conclusion.II.  ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS\r\nThe IDEA provides that a \"prevailing party\" may be\r\nawarded attorneys' fees and costs:\r\nIn any action or proceeding brought under this\r\nsubsection, the court, in its discretion, may\r\naward reasonable attorneys' fees as part of\r\nthe costs to the parents or guardian of a\r\nchild or youth with a disability who is the\r\nprevailing party.\r\n\n20 U.S.C.  1415(e)(4)(B).  The standards governing the award of\r\nattorneys' fees under 42 U.S.C.  1988 are applicable to awards\r\nunder the IDEA.  See Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433 n.7,\r\n103 S. Ct. 1933, 1939, 76 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1983); Jodlowski v. Valley\r\nView Community Unit Sch. Dist. # 365-U, 109 F.3d 1250, 1253 n.2\r\n(7th Cir. 1997); Urban v. Jefferson County Sch. Dist. R-1, 89 F.3d\r\n720, 729 (10th Cir. 1996); Aby-Sahyun v. Palo Alto Unified Sch.\r\nDist., 843 F.2d 1250, 1252 (9th Cir. 1988).  The district court\r\ndenied the application for fees, finding that appellants were not\r\nprevailing parties because:  (1) They did not receive \"the\r\nprincipal relief they requested, that is, reimbursement of the LPS\r\ntuition\" and (2) the changes made in the IEPs either \"simply gave\r\na more accurate account of the services Daniel had actually\r\nreceived\" or reflected minor and technical changes.  We review the\r\ndistrict court's denial of attorneys' fees for abuse of discretion. \r\nSee Williams v. Hanover Hous. Auth., 113 F.3d 1294, 1301 (1st Cir.\r\n1997) (denial of attorneys' fees under 42 U.S.C.  1988). \r\nTo qualify as a prevailing party, a litigant must\r\ndemonstrate that:  (1) He obtained relief on a significant claim in\r\nthe litigation; (2) such relief effected a material alteration in\r\nhis legal relationship with the defendant; and (3) the alteration\r\nis not merely technical or de minimis in nature.  See  Texas State\r\nTeachers Ass'n v. Garland Indep. Sch. Dist., 489 U.S. 782, 791-93,\r\n109 S. Ct. 1486, 103 L. Ed. 2d 866 (1989); Farrar v. Hobby, 506\r\nU.S. 103, 111-12, 113 S. Ct. 566, 573, 121 L. Ed. 2d 494 (1992) (\"a\r\nplaintiff 'prevails' when actual relief on the merits of his claim\r\nmaterially alters the legal relationship between the parties by\r\nmodifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits\r\nthe plaintiff\"); see also Hensley, 461 U.S. at 433 (litigant is a\r\nprevailing party \"if [he] succeed[s] on any significant issue in\r\nlitigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in\r\nbringing the suit\").  A party may demonstrate the changed legal\r\nrelationship in one of two ways:  \"The party either must enjoy\r\nbottom-line success in the litigation or act as a catalyst in\r\ncausing the desired alteration.\"  Paris v. U.S. Dept. of Hous. &amp;\r\nUrban Dev., 988 F.2d 236, 238 (1st Cir. 1993); see also Nadeau v. Helgemoe, 581 F.2d 275, 278-79 (1st Cir. 1978). \r\nAppellants contend that they were prevailing parties\r\nbecause they succeeded on several significant issues.  They contend\r\nthat their overall goal was to increase the special education\r\nservices provided to their son, \"not to obtain reimbursement of the\r\nprivate school tuition.\"  The record belies that contention.  The\r\nspecific relief appellants sought in their complaint was a\r\ndetermination that LPS was appropriate for Daniel and that they\r\nwere entitled to reimbursement for the expenses of LPS.  The\r\nhearing officer denied this relief.  We agree with the district\r\ncourt's finding (which appellants do not dispute) that the only\r\nrelief they received from the BSEA decision was in the form of some\r\nmodifications to the 1993-94 and the 1994-95 IEPs.  \"[T]he\r\nplaintiff cannot qualify as a 'prevailing party' if his 'success on\r\na legal claim can be characterized as purely technical or de\r\nminimis. . . .'\"  Kerry B. v. Union 53 Pub. Sch., 882 F. Supp. 184,\r\n187 (D. Mass. 1995) (quoting Texas State Teachers Ass'n, 489 U.S.\r\nat 792).  Even if the BSEA decision were seen as resulting in some\r\nimprovements in Daniel's program, it was not an abuse of discretion\r\nfor the district court to deny attorneys' fees where the changes\r\nordered are de minimis \"in the context of the Parents' broader\r\ngoals in this case.\"  Monticello Sch. Dist. No. 25 v. George L.,\r\n102 F.3d 895, 908 (7th Cir. 1996) (affirming denial of attorneys'\r\nfees despite changes to IEP ordered by hearing officer).  \r\nNor can appellants prevail under a catalyst theory.  To\r\nqualify, appellants must show \"'(1) a causal connection between the\r\nlitigation and the relief obtained, and (2) that the fee-target did\r\nnot act gratuitously.'\"  Williams, 113 F.3d at 1299 (quoting\r\nGuglietti v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Servs., 900 F.2d 397, 401\r\n(1st Cir. 1990)); see also Payne v. Board of Educ., Cleveland City\r\nSch., 88 F.3d 392, 398 (6th Cir. 1996).  Appellants argue that\r\ntheir pursuit of their legal remedies caused Mansfield to provide\r\nadditional educational services under the 1995-96 IEP (changes\r\nwhich the district court found to be minor and mostly technical in\r\nnature).  There is no indication, however, that Mansfield would \r\nhave failed to include a 502.4 prototype and additional special\r\neducation services in Daniel's 1995-96 IEP but for the\r\nadministrative hearing.

Appellants Larry and\r\nKathleen H. reside in Mansfield, Massachusetts with Daniel H.,\r\ntheir son.  Daniel is a child with disabilities within the meaning\r\nof the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20\r\nU.S.C.  1400-1485.  When Daniel's parents and the Mansfield\r\npublic school system were unable to agree on the services to be\r\nprovided Daniel, the parents removed him from the public school,\r\nunilaterally enrolled him in the Learning Prep School (LPS) and\r\nrequested a hearing with the Massachusetts Bureau of Special\r\nEducation Appeals (BSEA).  Following the hearings, the BSEA ruled\r\nin favor of the Mansfield School Committee (Mansfield), finding\r\nthat with some modifications to their program, Mansfield was and is\r\ncapable of meeting the child's needs, LPS was overly restrictive,\r\nand the parents were not entitled to be reimbursed for the LPS\r\nexpenses.  Appellants then sought judicial review in district\r\ncourt, which upheld the BSEA's decision and denied their\r\napplication for attorneys' fees.

(citing 20 U.S.C.  1412(5) and 34\r\nC.F.R.  300.552(d)).  \r\n             FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n     Daniel H. suffers from a language-based learning\r\ndisorder.  From kindergarten through the sixth grade, Daniel\r\nattended Mansfield public schools.  In the first, second and third\r\ngrades, Daniel received special education services in accordance\r\nwith his IEP with a 502.4 prototype.  In the fourth grade,\r\nDaniel's TEAM modified his IEP to a 502.3 prototype, and he was\r\nmainstreamed for mathematics.  In the fifth grade, Daniel was\r\nmainstreamed in all content areas after he successfully completed\r\nthe Stevenson Reading and Literature Program, a special education\r\ncurriculum, in accordance with his 1992-93 IEP.\r\nIn 1993, before Daniel entered the sixth grade, TEAM\r\ndetermined that a 502.1 program would provide him with the least\r\nrestrictive appropriate educational environment.  The 1993-94 IEP\r\nproposed that Daniel participate in a regular education program,\r\nwith one-half hour per week of speech and language monitoring and \r\nuse of a notebook to exchange information between the home and the\r\nschool.  Daniel's parents deferred their approval of the IEP until\r\nthey could obtain an independent evaluation of Daniel by the New\r\nEngland Medical Center (NEMC).\r\nNEMC evaluated Daniel in November 1993 and Daniel's\r\nmother gave a copy of the evaluation to Mansfield school officials. \r\nNEMC determined that Daniel had difficulties processing auditory\r\ninformation, retrieving words, and formulating sentences.  He\r\nperformed below average on reading and language tests but scored\r\nwell in mathematics.  NEMC recommended small group speech therapy\r\nas well as weekly consultations between a speech pathologist and\r\nDaniel's classroom teacher.  \r\nAround the same time, Daniel began having several\r\nproblems.  Academically, Daniel's mother felt that he was\r\nstruggling with his homework because it often took him three to\r\nfour hours to complete.  Socially, he incurred several disciplinary\r\ninfractions for fighting with other students and he began\r\ndefecating in his pants.  As a result, Kathleen H. arranged for\r\nDaniel to be counseled by a psychologist.\r\nAfter receiving NEMC's evaluation, Kathleen H. asked TEAM\r\nto modify the 1993-94 IEP to incorporate NEMC's recommendations. \r\nTEAM met in December 1993 and rewrote the IEP to reflect the\r\nspecial services that Daniel was then actually receiving, which\r\nincluded thirteen forty-minute support periods each week in the\r\nmainstream classroom, but refused to formally adopt NEMC's\r\nrecommendations.  In turn, Daniel's parents rejected the modified\r\nIEP on January 2, 1994.  On February 7, 1994, the school offered to\r\nsupplement Daniel's special education program by providing small\r\ngroup speech and language services twice a week, to fund regular\r\nconsultations between NEMC evaluators and Mansfield personnel, and\r\nto provide Daniel with a homework organization sheet to supplement\r\nhis notebook.  Daniel's parents never responded to this offer.\r\nTEAM met again in March 1994, to prepare Daniel's seventh\r\ngrade IEP.  The 1994-95 IEP proposed a 502.2 prototype program\r\nconsisting of the thirteen forty-minute support periods per week in\r\nthe mainstream classroom he was then receiving, supplemented by two\r\nforty-minute periods of speech and language instruction and\r\nconsultation to Daniel's classroom teachers by the speech and\r\nlanguage providers.  Attached to the IEP were NEMC's\r\nrecommendations which Mansfield would implement \"where\r\nappropriate,\" and Mansfield offered to fund consultations between\r\nDaniel's teacher and NEMC evaluators.  Daniel's parents rejected\r\nthe proposed IEP on March 31, 1994, and enrolled Daniel at LPS for\r\nthe 1994-95 school year.  \r\nDaniel's parents then appealed to the BSEA.  Following\r\nhearings, the hearing officer issued her decision.  Her salient\r\nfindings were that (1) with some modifications, Mansfield is and\r\nwas capable of meeting Daniel's needs; (2) while Mansfield made\r\nprocedural errors in the 1993-94 and 1994-95 IEPs, they did not\r\nrise to the level of noncompliance; (3) LPS was overly restrictive;\r\nand (4) the parents should not be reimbursed for the LPS expenses\r\nincurred during the 1994-95 period.  The hearing officer found that\r\ngiven Daniel's progress during his first five years, it was\r\nreasonable for Mansfield to place him in an integrated class. \r\nHowever, she faulted Mansfield for placing too much emphasis on\r\nDaniel's classroom performance as an evaluation tool and agreed\r\nwith appellants that the special services provided Daniel in the\r\nsixth grade were insufficient to maximize his potential.  She\r\nlisted several technical deficiencies in the IEPs:  (1) They failed\r\nto specify Daniel's current level of performance and his learning\r\nstyle; (2) they failed to provide sufficient criteria for measuring\r\nhis achievement; (3) they failed to specify one-on-one instruction\r\nin speech and language skills and individualized counseling on\r\nissues associated with adolescence; and (4) they failed to gather\r\nall this relevant information before writing Daniel's sixth grade\r\nIEP.  Nevertheless, she found, that Mansfield had not acted in bad\r\nfaith and that the IEPs lack of specificity did not deny Daniel\r\nsubstantive services.  And she concluded, \"The procedural mistakes\r\nin the writing of the IEP are not grave enough to assume that\r\n[Mansfield] lacks the capacity to develop or implement a special\r\neducation program for Daniel.\"\r\nDaniel's parents then sought judicial review.  The\r\ndistrict court upheld the BSEA decision, finding that (1)\r\nappellants had failed to show that the 1993-94 and 1994-95 IEPs\r\nwere not adequate and appropriate for Daniel, and (2) the drafting\r\ndeficiencies were matters of form rather than substance and do not\r\nimpeach the results actually achieved.  Because it found that\r\nDaniel thrived in the mainstream experience and Mansfield was\r\nwilling and able to provide the further help he needed, it held\r\nthat Daniel's parents were not entitled to recover the cost of\r\nenrolling Daniel in LPS.  Finally, the court determined that\r\nDaniel's parents were not prevailing parties, and therefore not\r\nentitled to recover their attorneys' fees and costs.\r\n                       DISCUSSION\r\nI.   BSEA DECISION\r\nA.   Standard of Review\r\n\"The ultimate question for a court under the Act is\r\nwhether a proposed IEP is adequate and appropriate for a particular\r\nchild at a given point in time.\"  Burlington II, 736 F.2d at 788. \r\nThe district court's resolution of that question is a mixed\r\nquestion of law and fact that we review for clear error \"[a]bsent\r\na showing that the wrong legal rule was employed.\"  Roland M., 910\r\nF.2d at 990.  We \"accept a district court's resolution of questions\r\nanent adequacy and appropriateness of an IEP so long as the court's\r\nconclusions are not clearly erroneous on the record as a whole.\" \r\nId. at 990-91. \r\nB.   Merits\r\nAppellants contend that the district court erred in\r\nconcluding that the IEPs were adequate and appropriate to maximize\r\nDaniel's development in the least restrictive environment and claim\r\nthe court's decision is unsupported by the record.  They fail,\r\nhowever, to demonstrate clear error.\r\nWith regard to the 1993-94 IEP, appellants claim that the\r\ncourt erred in finding that Daniel made encouraging progress in the\r\nregular classroom in the first through fifth grades.  They allege\r\nthat Daniel \"was being taught in a resource room outside of the\r\nregular education classroom\" during these years, and that the court\r\n\"totally ignored the facts contained in the record regarding\r\nDaniel's lack of progress during the sixth grade.\"  The court's\r\nfinding was based on the detailed findings of the hearing officer\r\nwho reached the same conclusion.  Its review was appropriately\r\n\"thorough yet deferential.\"  Roland M., 910 F.2d at 989. \r\nAppellants have failed to demonstrate that the court committed\r\nerror.\r\nWith respect to the 1994-95 IEP, appellants contend that\r\nthe court erred in finding that the changes ordered by the hearing\r\nofficer simply gave a more accurate account of the services Daniel\r\nhad actually received.  The hearing officer ordered Mansfield to\r\nadopt certain NEMC recommendations regarding increased speech and\r\nlanguage instruction, small-group reading and writing instruction,\r\nand bi-weekly counseling.  She also found, however, that with\r\nproper accommodations, Daniel's needs can be met at Mansfield,\r\nwhich is the least restrictive environment for him.  And she\r\nconcluded that Mansfield's procedural errors did not rise to the\r\nlevel of noncompliance.    Thus, even if the IEP was initially\r\ndeficient, our focus in assessing its adequacy is on the IEP as it\r\nemerges from the administrative review process.  See Roland M., 910\r\nF.2d at 988; see also Amann v. Stow Sch. Sys., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597411\"><a href=\"/opinion/597411/christopher-amann-v-stow-school-system/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">644</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 650-51\r\n(1st Cir. 1992) (IEP adequate and appropriate even though hearing\r\nofficer ordered modifications).  We discern no error.   \r\nAppellants also rest their argument on the IEP proposed\r\nfor 1995-96, pointing out that its recommendation to place Daniel\r\nin a 502.4 prototype program (as opposed to the 502.2 prototype in\r\nthe 1994-95 IEP) contradicts the court's findings.  Under the\r\nIDEA's scheme, however, an IEP must be reviewed annually and\r\nrevised when necessary.  The fact that Mansfield revised Daniel's\r\nIEP between the 1994-95 and the 1995-96 school years is not\r\nevidence that the IEP for the previous year was inadequate.\r\nWe conclude that appellants have failed to demonstrate\r\nclear error in the district court's ruling that the IEPs were\r\nadequate and appropriate.  See Burlington II, 736 F.2d at 794\r\n(parents bear burden of proving IEP's inadequacy); see also Amann,\r\n982 F.2d at 650 (same).  As we stated in Roland M., \"[b]efore an\r\nIEP is set aside, there must be some rational basis to believe that\r\nprocedural inadequacies compromised the pupil's right to an\r\nappropriate education, seriously hampered the parents' opportunity\r\nto participate in the formulation process, or caused a deprivation\r\nof educational benefits.\"  910 F.2d at 994.  The district court was\r\nsatisfied that appellants' showing failed to meet that test and we\r\nsee no clear error in its conclusion.II.  ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS\r\nThe IDEA provides that a \"prevailing party\" may be\r\nawarded attorneys' fees and costs:\r\nIn any action or proceeding brought under this\r\nsubsection, the court, in its discretion, may\r\naward reasonable attorneys' fees as part of\r\nthe costs to the parents or guardian of a\r\nchild or youth with a disability who is the\r\nprevailing party.\r\n\n20 U.S.C.  1415(e)(4)(B).  The standards governing the award of\r\nattorneys' fees under 42 U.S.C.  1988 are applicable to awards\r\nunder the IDEA.  See Hensley v.

They contend\r\nthat their overall goal was to increase the special education\r\nservices provided to their son, \"not to obtain reimbursement of the\r\nprivate school tuition.\"  The record belies that contention.  The\r\nspecific relief appellants sought in their complaint was a\r\ndetermination that LPS was appropriate for Daniel and that they\r\nwere entitled to reimbursement for the expenses of LPS.  The\r\nhearing officer denied this relief.  We agree with the district\r\ncourt's finding (which appellants do not dispute) that the only\r\nrelief they received from the BSEA decision was in the form of some\r\nmodifications to the 1993-94 and the 1994-95 IEPs.  \"[T]he\r\nplaintiff cannot qualify as a 'prevailing party' if his 'success on\r\na legal claim can be characterized as purely technical or de\r\nminimis. . . .'\"  Kerry B. v.

Even if the BSEA decision were seen as resulting in some\r\nimprovements in Daniel's program, it was not an abuse of discretion\r\nfor the district court to deny attorneys' fees where the changes\r\nordered are de minimis \"in the context of the Parents' broader\r\ngoals in this case.\"  Monticello Sch.

Appellants argue that\r\ntheir pursuit of their legal remedies caused Mansfield to provide\r\nadditional educational services under the 1995-96 IEP (changes\r\nwhich the district court found to be minor and mostly technical in\r\nnature).  There is no indication, however, that Mansfield would \r\nhave failed to include a 502.4 prototype and additional special\r\neducation services in Daniel's 1995-96 IEP but for the\r\nadministrative hearing.  See Payne, 88 F.3d at 400 (\"Even where a\r\ndefendant makes some changes following administrative proceedings\r\nthat comport with a plaintiff's demands, if the actions are taken\r\nunilaterally by the defendant and there is no indication that they\r\nwould not have transpired had the plaintiff not pursued the\r\nadministrative process, the plaintiff cannot qualify as a\r\n'prevailing party' for fee-shifting purposes.\") (citing Combs v.
