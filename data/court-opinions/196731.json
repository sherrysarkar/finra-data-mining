See\r                                                                           \r\n\n18 U.S.C.     1341, 1343,  2314; 42 U.S.C.    408(a)(7)(B).   The\r\n\ndistrict court convened a disposition hearing on  August 3, 1995.\r\n\nUsing the  version of the  guidelines that was in  effect on that\r\n\ndate, see United  States v.  Harotunian, 920  F.2d 1040,  1041-42\r                                                 \r\n\n(1st  Cir. 1990),  the  court computed  the guideline  sentencing\r\n\nrange (GSR) at 30-37 months  and imposed a 33-month incarcerative\r\n\nsentence.   Feldman now  challenges the court's  determination of\r\n\nthe GSR and, ultimately, the sentence imposed.  We affirm.\r\n\nI.  OVERVIEW\r          I.  OVERVIEW\r\n\n          We  draw an  overview of  the facts  necessary  to shed\r\n\nlight on  this appeal  from the Presentence  Investigation Report\r\n\n(PSI  Report) and the transcript of the disposition hearing.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited States v. Dietz, 950 F.2d 50, 51 (1st Cir. 1991).\r                                \r\n\n          The defendant worked  for Norman and Eleanor Rabb  as a\r\n\nhome attendant from May  to October of 1993, assisting  them with\r\n\ntheir personal care.  The Rabbs were octogenarians.  In addition,\r\n\nMr. Rabb was in  failing health and afflicted by  a deteriorating\r\n\nmental condition.   The couple  could not  handle their  personal\r\n\nfinances and  a long-time  retainer, herself  seventy-eight years\r\n\nold, wrote checks to pay their household expenses.\r\n\n          During  the  course of  his  employment,  the defendant\r\n\nbecame  privy to the Rabbs' finances.  Having obtained Mr. Rabb's\r\n\nsocial security  number and  the account numbers  for a  Fidelity\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nInvestments trust account and a Bank of Boston checking  account,\r\n\nhe set out to defraud  the Rabbs upon leaving their employ.   His\r\n\nmodus  operandi involved siphoning funds from  both the trust and\r                         \r\n\nchecking  accounts by impersonating  Mr. Rabb, forging negotiable\r\n\ninstruments, and  similar  artifices.   To cover  his tracks,  he\r\n\nsubmitted to the postal service change of address forms directing\r\n\nthat all  the Rabbs' business mail be forwarded to the address of\r\n\nhis  own dwelling.   The  defendant then  retained the  mail that\r\n\nwould have  revealed his skulduggery  (such as the  monthly trust\r\n\naccount statements)  and forwarded the remainder to  the Rabbs to\r\n\nquell  any   suspicions.    All  told,   the  defendant  pilfered\r\n\n$139,972.00  from  the  trust  account and  $59,423.68  from  the\r\n\nchecking account before his shenanigans were discovered.\r\n\nII.  DISCUSSION\r          II.  DISCUSSION\r\n\n          The  defendant  challenges  two  rulings  made  by  the\r\n\ndistrict court in constructing the GSR.  We address these rulings\r\n\nseriatim.\r\n\n                   A.  Obstruction of Justice.\r                             A.  Obstruction of Justice.\r                                                       \r\n\n          Invoking   U.S.S.G.    3C1.1,1   the   district   court\r\n\nincreased  the  defendant's  offense  level  for  obstruction  of\r\n\njustice.  In requesting  the two-level enhancement the government\r\n\nargued  that  the defendant  burned  bank  statements and  checks\r\n\nbelonging  to the  Rabbs in  his fireplace  on October  13, 1994,\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1This  guideline directs  a  two-level  increase  \"[i]f  the\r\ndefendant  willfully  obstructed  or  impeded,  or  attempted  to\r\nobstruct  or impede,  the  administration of  justice during  the\r\ninvestigation,   prosecution,  or   sentencing  of   the  instant\r\noffense.\"  U.S.S.G.  3C1.1 (Nov. 1994).\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nafter learning that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had\r\n\nlaunched an  investigation.  The  defendant admitted that  he had\r\n\ndestroyed  documents after  learning  of the  investigation.   He\r\n\nnonetheless  objected to the upward  adjustment on the basis that\r\n\nhe had  not burned financial data but had only burned drafts of a\r\n\nwill  and  letters of  apology that  he  had written  (though not\r\n\nmailed) to  the Rabbs.  The district court did not choose between\r\n\nthese  versions but stated in effect that, on either version, the\r\n\nenhancement applied.\r\n\n          1.   Adequacy of Findings.  The  defendant asserts that\r                    1.   Adequacy of Findings.\r                                             \r\n\nthe  district  court  erred  in leaving  unresolved  the  factual\r\n\ncontroversy concerning  what the flames  consumed.   We review  a\r\n\nsentencing court's factual findings under section 3C1.1 for clear\r\n\nerror,  see United States  v. Aymelek, 926 F.2d  64, 68 (1st Cir.\r                                               \r\n\n1991),  but  we  afford   plenary  review  to  essentially  legal\r\n\ndeterminations  (such   as  whether  section  3C1.1   includes  a\r\n\ndefendant's allegedly obstructive conduct within its scope),  see\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited States v. Emery, 991 F.2d 907, 910 (1st Cir. 1993).\r                                \r\n\n          When a  defendant alleges that a PSI  Report contains a\r\n\nfactual inaccuracy,  the district  court  ordinarily must  either\r\n\nmake  a  finding, up  or  down,  as to  the  allegation, or  else\r\n\ndetermine that  no finding is necessary  because the controverted\r\n\nmatter will not be taken  into consideration in connection  with,\r\n\nor  will not affect, the sentencing decision.   See Fed. R. Crim.\r                                                             \r\n\nP. 32(c)(1); see  also U.S.S.G.   6A1.3 (Nov. 1994).   Thus,  the\r                                \r\n\nsentencing court need not resolve factual conflicts when doing so\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nwill  serve no  useful purpose.   See  United States  v. Fuentes-\r                                                                           \r\n\nVazquez, 52 F.3d 394, 397 (1st Cir. 1995); see also United States\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.  Sepulveda, 15  F.3d  1161, 1199-1200  (1st Cir.  1993), cert.\r                                                                           \r\n\ndenied, 114 S. Ct. 2714 (1994).  The instant case exemplifies the\r                \r\n\npoint:   the  judge was  not obliged  to choose  between the  two\r\n\nconflicting  accounts  if  under  either  version  the  documents\r\n\nconstituted material evidence.  We explain briefly.\r\n\n          Given  that the defendant knew of the ongoing FBI probe\r\n\nand  nonetheless intentionally  incinerated  documents, the  only\r\n\nquestion that remained was whether the documents in the pyre were\r\n\nmaterial to the investigation.  See United States v. St. Cyr, 977\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d  698, 705  (1st  Cir. 1992)  (explaining that  a defendant's\r\n\nactions  must  impede  the  government's  investigation  in  some\r\n\nmaterial  way to trigger  an obstruction enhancement).   The bank\r\n\nrecords that  the government described  plainly met the  test for\r\n\nmateriality.  In the alternative, the government argued that even\r\n\nif  the defendant  had been  toasting  letters of  apology, those\r\n\nletters would  also be material  and, hence, the  defendant would\r\n\nstill  be  guilty  of  an  obstruction  of  justice  within   the\r\n\ncontemplation of  section 3C1.1.   The record indicates  that the\r\n\nlower court accepted this reasoning.  The court stated:\r\n\n          [T]he defendant burned certain material after\r\n          he knew  about the investigation  that was in\r\n          progress and  that he did so  in this Court's\r\n          mind   with   an  idea   of   preventing  the\r\n          Government  from obtaining  relevant material\r\n          evidence.\r\n\n          Three   principles    guide   our   review    of   this\r\n\ndetermination.    First,  the  test  for  materiality  under  the\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nobstruction-of-justice guideline  is not  stringent.   See United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Ovalle-Marquez, 36 F.3d 212, 226 (1st Cir. 1994), cert.\r                                                                           \r\n\ndenied, 115  S. Ct. 947, 1322  (1995); St. Cyr, 977  F.2d at 705.\r                                                        \r\n\nSecond, a  sentencing judge's finding of  materiality is reviewed\r\n\nonly for clear error.   See United States v. Biyaga, 9  F.3d 204,\r                                                             \r\n\n205 (1st Cir. 1993); United States v. Pineda, 981  F.2d 569, 574-\r                                                      \r\n\n75 (1st Cir.  1992).   Third, the  Sentencing Commission  defines\r\n\n\"material\"  evidence in this context as evidence that \"would tend\r\n\nto influence or affect the  issue under determination.\"  U.S.S.G.\r\n\n 3C1.1,  comment. (n.5)  (Nov. 1994); see  also United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nKelley, 76 F.3d 436, 441 (1st Cir. 1996).\r                \r\n\n          These  three   principles  counsel  rejection   of  the\r\n\ndefendant's  assignment of error.   The papers that the defendant\r\n\nburned  were material if  they could have  influenced or affected\r\n\nthe  official investigation  into  his fraud.    If those  papers\r\n\nincluded  the  Rabbs'  bank  statements  and  checks  (which  the\r\n\ndefendant  had intercepted  and which  were never  located), they\r\n\nwere obviously material.2   If, however, the  papers included the\r\n\ndefendant's written apologia  to the Rabbs,  then they were  also\r\n\nmaterial.  A letter of apology to the victims of a crime, even in\r\n\ndraft form,  is tantamount  to a confession  of guilt.   Had this\r\n\nvoluntary   confession,  in  the  defendant's  handwriting,  been\r\n\nuncovered  in his home on  that October afternoon,  it would have\r\n\nhad the potential to influence the investigation of the fraud.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2The defendant claims somewhat unconvincingly that he \"lost\"\r\nall the bank records and checks belonging to the Rabbs.\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\n          In  this case, all roads  lead to Rome.   Regardless of\r\n\nwhich  version  of events  the  sentencing  court believed,  both\r\n\nentailed  the destruction of material  evidence in the  face of a\r\n\nknown  investigation.   Thus,  we descry  no  clear error  in the\r\n\nsentencing court's determination that the defendant's burning  of\r\n\nevidence   whether bank records or letters of apology   warranted\r\n\nan upward adjustment under section 3C1.1.  By the same token, the\r\n\ndistrict court  did not  err in  declining to  spin the  web more\r\n\nfinely  by making a particularized finding as to the exact nature\r\n\nof the documents that were burned.\r\n\n          This conclusion  likewise  stills the  defendant's  cry\r\n\nthat the district court  abused its discretion when it  failed to\r\n\nhold  an  evidentiary  hearing  to resolve  the  factual  dispute\r\n\nconcerning the  nature  of the  burned  documents.   Because  the\r\n\ndefendant  destroyed evidence  material to  the investigation  on\r\n\neither  version  of the  facts, the  evidentiary hearing  that he\r\n\ndemanded would have  amounted to  an empty charade.   A  district\r\n\ncourt need not   indeed, should not   hold an evidentiary hearing\r\n\nwhen nothing will turn on it.3\r\n\n          2.   Fifth Amendment.  The  defendant's backup argument\r                    2.   Fifth Amendment.\r                                        \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3The defendant  also contends that the  district court erred\r\nin failing to  make a  factual finding that  the defendant  acted\r\nwillfully and  with specific  intent to avoid  responsibility for\r\nthe fraud.    This contention  misperceives  the record.    Judge\r\nGorton did make  an explicit finding  of specific intent,  noting\r\nthat the  defendant's act of burning documents occurred \"after he\r\nknew about the investigation  that was in progress\" and  that the\r\ndefendant  had in mind \"an idea of preventing the Government from\r\nobtaining  relevant material  evidence.\"   We require  no greater\r\nprecision  from  a  sentencing  court.    See  United  States  v.\r                                                                       \r\nGonzales, 12 F.3d 298, 299-300 (1st Cir. 1993).\r                  \r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\non obstruction  of justice involves a  strained interpretation of\r\n\nthe  constitutional  right against  compelled self-incrimination.\r\n\nHe  posits that  the  papers he  burned  were personal  papers   \r\n\nletters of apology   not prepared in the course of committing the\r\n\noffense, and he asseverates that it was  his constitutional right\r\n\nto   incinerate  these   personal  papers   in  order   to  avoid\r\n\nincriminating   himself.     This   argument   misconstrues   the\r\n\nprotections that the Fifth Amendment offers.\r\n\n          The  law  is clear  that,  though  the Fifth  Amendment\r\n\nprotects  against  the  compelled  preparation  of  incriminating\r\n\ndocuments  as  well  as   the  compelled  production  of  private\r\n\ndocuments when the act of production itself is incriminating, the\r\n\nAmendment does  not act  as a  general bar  to the production  of\r\n\nprivate information  voluntarily prepared.  See  United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nDoe,  465 U.S. 605, 610-11  (1984); Fisher v.  United States, 425\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. 391, 400-01 (1976).  Once  an individual chooses voluntarily\r\n\nto prepare a written account, the act of preparation serves as an\r\n\neffective waiver of the Fifth  Amendment's protections.  See Doe,\r                                                                          \r\n\n465  U.S. at 610-11.  In other  words, just as a defendant cannot\r\n\nbegin to testify  at trial and  then change his  mind, a  suspect\r\n\ncannot create a testimonial communication embodying incriminating\r\n\nadmissions and then  choose to destroy it  when he knows that  it\r\n\nhas become relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation.\r\n\n          In  this  instance,  the  defendant  concedes  that  he\r\n\nvoluntarily  prepared  letters  of   apology,  but  he  claims  a\r\n\nprivilege on  the  basis that  the  letters were  private  papers\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nunrelated to the commission  of the crime.   This point does  not\r\n\naid the defendant's quest.\r\n\n          The  Fifth Amendment does not deal  with the privacy of\r\n\nthe contents of documents, but, rather, with the voluntariness of\r\n\ntheir preparation and production.   See Fisher, 425 U.S.  at 401.\r                                                        \r\n\nThis  court has  stated  that  if  the  privilege  against  self-\r\n\nincrimination applies at all  to the contents of  private papers,\r\n\nit does so  \"only in rare situations, where  compelled disclosure\r\n\nwould break the heart of our sense of privacy.\"  In re Grand Jury\r                                                                           \r\n\nSubpoena, 973 F.2d 45, 51 (1st Cir. 1992) (citations and internal\r                  \r\n\nquotation  marks  omitted).    The  defendant's  letters,  as  he\r\n\ndescribes them, do not fit this mold.\r\n\n          The appellant  goes one  step further when  he suggests\r\n\nthat the  privilege against self-incrimination includes the right\r\n\nto  destroy  voluntarily  prepared   documents.    Otherwise,  he\r\n\nmaintains, any time a defendant authors personal notes that might\r\n\naid  an investigation, and  later decides to  eradicate them, the\r\n\nfact  of destruction  could be  used to  enhance his  punishment.\r\n\nThis may be so   but the contention that such a rule violates the\r\n\nprivilege against self-inculpation  distorts the contours  of the\r\n\nFifth  Amendment.   There  is simply  no constitutional  right to\r\n\ndestroy evidence.\r\n\n          The Supreme Court made the  point bluntly in Segura  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nUnited States, 468 U.S.  796 (1984).

Though a\r                                           \r\n\nperson  ordinarily may refuse to prepare  or produce any evidence\r\n\nthat is self-incriminating, see,  e.g., Andresen v. Maryland, 427\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. 463, 475 (1976), that privilege  in no way suggests that the\r\n\nperson  may take  affirmative action  to destroy evidence    even\r\n\nevidence that  he himself  has created    once he  is aware  that\r\n\nauthorities  are searching for it  (or something like  it).  That\r\n\nact  of affirmative  misconduct,  undertaken with  the intent  of\r\n\nhindering an extant investigation, is the paradigmatic example of\r\n\nan  obstruction  of  justice.    See  U.S.S.G.   3C1.1,  comment.\r                                              \r\n\n(n.3(d)) (Nov. 1994).\r\n\n          Nor  do  the sentencing  guidelines  provide a  special\r\n\nlayer  of swaddling.  To be sure, the Sentencing Commission wrote\r\n\nthat the  enhancement for obstruction of justice \"is not intended\r\n\nto  punish  a  defendant for  the  exercise  of a  constitutional\r\n\nright.\"   U.S.S.G.   3C1.1, comment.  (n.1)  (Nov. 1994).    This\r\n\nreminder  of Fifth  Amendment  safeguards simply  means that  the\r\n\nenhancement should not apply to a defendant who does no more than\r\n\nstand  upon  his  rights,  say, by  maintaining  his  silence  or\r\n\nrefusing  voluntarily to  disclose  evidence of  his guilt.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nThomas W.

Affirmative\r                  \r\n\nmisconduct, however,  is the intended target  of the obstruction-\r\n\nof-justice  enhancement, and, as  such, increasing  a defendant's\r\n\nsentence  for  affirmative  misconduct  does  not  trespass  upon\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nprotected terrain.\r\n\n          In sum,  the defendant's  act of  burning incriminating\r\n\ndocuments was not shielded  by the Fifth Amendment even  if those\r\n\ndocuments comprised  personal  papers that  he  himself  created.\r\n\nHence,  the  sentencing court  did not  err  when it  applied the\r\n\nsection 3C1.1 enhancement in this case.4\r\n\n                     B.

We are in  general agreement with\r\n\nthe  defendant's premise:   in  determining  the propriety  of an\r\n\nupward  adjustment  for  vulnerability,  the  sentencing  court's\r\n\nsights   must    be   trained   on    the   victim's   individual\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4At oral  argument defense counsel suggested  that the Fifth\r\nAmendment  applied here  because  the  letters  were  preliminary\r\ndrafts  rather than finished products.   We do  not consider that\r\nargument.  It was not made below,  it was not made in the briefs,\r\nand it was  not developed at any time.   It is, therefore, triply\r\nwaived.\r\n\n     5The guidelines provide  for a  two-level upward  adjustment\r\nwhen an  offender \"knew or should have known that a victim of the\r\noffense was unusually vulnerable  due to age, physical  or mental\r\ncondition,   or  that   a  victim   was  otherwise   particularly\r\nsusceptible  to the  criminal  conduct.\"   U.S.S.G.  3A1.1  (Nov.\r\n1994).\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\ncharacteristics.   Thus, in order to warrant a finding of unusual\r\n\nvulnerability, there must be some evidence, above and beyond mere\r\n\nmembership  in a large class, that the victim possessed a special\r\n\nweakness  that the  defendant exploited.   See  United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nSmith,  930 F.2d 1450,  1455 (10th  Cir.)

Rowe, 999 F.2d 14,  17 (1st Cir. 1993) (cautioning that\r                        \r\n\ncourts  cannot predicate  a finding  of unusual  vulnerability on\r\n\ngeneralizations about large classes to which the victim belongs).\r\n\n           Contrary  to the  defendant's importuning,  the record\r\n\nreflects  that the  district  court apprehended  and applied  the\r\n\nstandard enunciated above.   This conclusion is buttressed in two\r\n\nseparate  ways.  First,  at the  sentencing hearing  Judge Gorton\r\n\nexplicitly found  (a) that \"the  defendant knew that  the victim,\r\n\nNorman  Rabb,  was elderly  and  that his  mental  faculties were\r                                                                           \r\n\nfailing\"  (emphasis  supplied),   and  (b)  that  the   defendant\r                 \r\n\nproceeded to exploit this condition.  Second, the judge expressly\r\n\nadopted  the factual  findings contained  in the  PSI Report    a\r\n\ndocument  that  made  clear,  inter   alia,  that  Mr.  Rabb  was\r                                                    \r\n\nphysically  debilitated and that the Rabbs  were unable to handle\r\n\ntheir  personal finances.  We have accepted such findings as long\r\n\nas the purport and intent of the sentencing court is clear.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited  States  v. Savoie,  985 F.2d  612,  620 (1st  Cir. 1993).\r                                   \r\n\nThese adopted findings qualify under that test.\r\n\n          To say more would be supererogatory.  The record simply\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\ndoes not bear out the claim that the sentencing court applied the\r\n\nenhancement only  because the Rabbs were  octogenarians or shared\r\n\ncertain generic aspects of a class of elderly persons.\r\n\n          2.  Targeting.   The defendant  also contends that  the\r                    2.  Targeting.\r                                 \r\n\nsentencing  court erred  in  applying section  3A1.1 because  the\r\n\ngovernment  did not show that he  targeted the Rabbs due to their\r\n\nparticular  vulnerability to  the planned  fraud.   This argument\r\n\nprescinds from the Sentencing Commission's advisory (now revoked,\r\n\nbut  in  effect on  the date  of  Feldman's sentencing)  that the\r\n\nadjustment  here  in  question  \"applies  to  offenses  where  an\r\n\nunusually vulnerable victim is made a target of criminal activity\r\n\nby the defendant.\"  U.S.S.G.  3A1.1, comment. (n.1)  (Nov. 1994).\r\n\nThe defendant maintains that, unless we are prepared to disregard\r\n\nRowe's interpretation  of the  \"target\" language, the  government\r              \r\n\nmust demonstrate  that the offender selected  his victims because\r\n\nof some \"special susceptibility.\"  Rowe, 999 F.2d at 17.\r                                                 \r\n\n          A backward glance helps to place this asseveration into\r\n\nperspective.  Application Note 1, in its pre-1995 form, proved to\r\n\nbe controversial.  In particular, the \"target\" language split the\r\n\ncircuits on the issue of whether the government had to prove that\r\n\nthe defendant was motivated by the victim's special vulnerability\r\n\nin  order to  lay a  foundation for  the upward  adjustment, see,\r                                                                          \r\n\ne.g., United States  v.

See\r                                                                           \r\n\nRowe, 999 F.2d at 17.\r              \r\n\n          We  need not probe the point more deeply.  For purposes\r\n\nof the  case at hand,  the dispute is  academic; either  way, the\r\n\nproof suffices.  As  for future cases, the  Sentencing Commission\r\n\nhas  removed all reasonable  doubt by amending  the commentary to\r\n\nsection  3A1.1.  In an  effort to resolve  \"some inconsistency in\r\n\nthe  application  of   3A1.1  regarding whether  this  adjustment\r\n\nrequired proof  that the  defendant had  `targeted the  victim on\r\n\naccount of the victim's vulnerability,'\" U.S.S.G. App. C., Amend.\r\n\n521,  at 430  (Nov. 1995),  the Commission  deleted  the \"target\"\r\n\nlanguage.   The revised  note merely  states that  the vulnerable\r\n\nvictim  provision \"applies  to  offenses  involving an  unusually\r\n\nvulnerable victim in  which the  defendant knows  or should  have\r\n\nknown of  the victim's unusual vulnerability.\"   U.S.S.G.  3A1.1,\r\n\ncomment.  (n.2) (Nov. 1995).  In future cases this provision, not\r\n\nour statements in Rowe, will govern.\r                                \r\n\n          Applying  Rowe  generously,  i.e.,  assuming  arguendo,\r                                                                          \r\n\nfavorably to Feldman, that targeting was an essential  element of\r\n\nthe government's proof, the  defendant's argument founders.  Rowe\r                                                                           \r\n\nmerely requires that a special susceptibility have  been a factor\r\n\nin the offender's process of selecting  his prey.  See id. at 16-\r                                                                    \r\n\n17 &amp; n.3.  This means that  the government did not need to  prove\r\n\nhere  that  the defendant  set  out  to  defraud elderly,  infirm\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\npeople,  and targeted the  Rabbs because they  fit the bill.   It\r\n\nalso means that  the government  did not need  to prove that  the\r\n\nRabbs' infirmities were the sole reason that the defendant zeroed\r\n\nin on them.   Even under the Rowe regime,  expansively construed,\r                                           \r\n\nthe government had to  show only that the defendant  selected the\r\n\nRabbs  as his  victims  in part  because  they were  elderly  and\r\n\ninfirm.   See Cree, 915 F.2d at 354 (explaining that \"enhancing a\r                            \r\n\ndefendant's sentence  based on victim vulnerability  is justified\r\n\nonly when a  defendant's actions  in some way  exploited or  took\r                                                       \r\n\nadvantage of that vulnerability\") (emphasis supplied).\r\n\n          The  record  in this  case  contains  more than  enough\r\n\nevidence to  justify a finding  that the  defendant targeted  the\r\n\nRabbs  because of their vulnerability.  After all, he entered the\r\n\nRabbs'  employ  only  because  of  their  infirmity and,  in  his\r\n\ncapacity as a home care assistant, he gained copious knowledge of\r\n\ntheir  afflictions.   Knowing  of their  diminished capacity,  he\r\n\nobtained  information necessary  to carry  out  his plot.   Given\r\n\nthese and other facts,  we believe that the record  establishes a\r\n\nnexus   between   victims'   susceptibility    and   victimizer's\r\n\ncriminality adequate  to establish targeting.   See United States\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Pavao,  948 F.2d 74, 78  (1st Cir. 1991).   Thus, the district\r                  \r\n\ncourt's  finding  that  the  defendant targeted  his  victims  on\r\n\naccount of their age and infirmity warrants our approbation.\r\n\n          We need  go no further.   Here, the  defendant selected\r\n\nhis  victims because he had been their personal caretaker and had\r\n\ndiscovered their vulnerabilities at first hand.

See 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1341, 1343, 2314;  42 U.S.C. &#167; 408(a)(7)(B).   The district court convened a disposition hearing on August 3, 1995.   Using the version of the guidelines that was in effect on that date, see United States v. Harotunian, 920 F.2d 1040, 1041-42 (1st Cir.1990), the court computed the guideline sentencing range (GSR) at 30-37 months and imposed a 33-month incarcerative sentence.   Feldman now challenges the court's determination of the GSR and, ultimately, the sentence imposed.   We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. OVERVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We draw an overview of the facts necessary to shed light on this appeal from the Presentence Investigation Report (PSI Report) and the transcript of the disposition hearing.   See United States v. Dietz, 950 F.2d 50, 51 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant worked for Norman and Eleanor Rabb as a home attendant from May to October of 1993, assisting them with their personal care.   The Rabbs were octogenarians.   In addition, Mr. Rabb was in failing health and afflicted by a deteriorating mental condition.   The couple could not handle their personal finances and a long-time retainer, herself seventy-eight years old, wrote checks to pay their household expenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the course of his employment, the defendant became privy to the Rabbs' finances.   Having obtained Mr. Rabb's social security number and the account numbers for a Fidelity Investments trust account and a Bank of Boston checking account, he set out to defraud the Rabbs upon leaving their employ.   His modus operandi involved siphoning funds from both the trust and checking accounts by impersonating Mr. Rabb, forging negotiable instruments, and similar artifices.   To cover his tracks, he submitted to the postal service change of address forms directing that all the Rabbs' business mail be forwarded to the address of his own dwelling.   The defendant then retained the mail that would have revealed his skulduggery (such as the monthly trust account statements) and forwarded the remainder to the Rabbs to quell any suspicions.   All told, the defendant pilfered $139,972.00 from the trust account and $59,423.68 from the checking account before his shenanigans were discovered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant challenges two rulings made by the district court in constructing the GSR.   We address these rulings seriatim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>A. Obstruction of Justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Invoking U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> the district court increased the defendant's offense level for obstruction of justice.   In requesting the two-level enhancement the government argued that the defendant burned bank statements and checks belonging to the Rabbs in his fireplace on October 13, 1994, after learning that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had launched an investigation.   The defendant admitted that he had destroyed documents after learning of the investigation.   He nonetheless objected to the upward adjustment on the basis that he had not burned financial data but had only burned drafts of a will and letters of apology that he had written (though not mailed) to the Rabbs.   The district court did not choose between these versions but stated in effect that, on either version, the enhancement applied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.   Adequacy of Findings.   The defendant asserts that the district court erred in leaving unresolved the factual controversy concerning what the flames consumed.   We review a sentencing court's factual findings under section 3C1.1 for clear error, see United States v. Aymelek, 926 F.2d 64, 68 (1st Cir.1991), but we afford plenary review to essentially legal determinations (such as whether section 3C1.1 includes a defendant's allegedly obstructive conduct within its scope), see United States v. Emery, 991 F.2d 907, 910 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a defendant alleges that a PSI Report contains a factual inaccuracy, the district court ordinarily must either make a finding, up or down, as to the allegation, or else determine that no finding is necessary because the controverted matter will not be taken into consideration in connection with, or will not affect, the sentencing decision.   See Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(1);  see also U.S.S.G. &#167; 6A1.3 (Nov.1994).   Thus, the sentencing court need not resolve factual conflicts when doing so will serve no useful purpose.   See United States v. Fuentes-Vazquez, 52 F.3d 394, 397 (1st Cir.1995);  see also United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1199-1200 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 2714, 129 L.Ed.2d 840 (1994).   The instant case exemplifies the point:  the judge was not obliged to choose between the two conflicting accounts if under either version the documents constituted material evidence.   We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given that the defendant knew of the ongoing FBI probe and nonetheless intentionally incinerated documents, the only question that remained was whether the documents in the pyre were material to the investigation.   See United States v. St. Cyr, 977 F.2d 698, 705 (1st Cir.1992) (explaining that a defendant's actions must impede the government's investigation in some material way to trigger an obstruction enhancement).   The bank records that the government described plainly met the test for materiality.   In the alternative, the government argued that even if the defendant had been toasting letters of apology, those letters would also be material and, hence, the defendant would still be guilty of an obstruction of justice within the contemplation of section 3C1.1.   The record indicates that the lower court accepted this reasoning.   The court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>[T]he defendant burned certain material after he knew about the investigation that was in progress and that he did so in this Court's mind with an idea of preventing the Government from obtaining relevant material evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three principles guide our review of this determination.   First, the test for materiality under the obstruction-of-justice guideline is not stringent.   See United States v. Ovalle-Marquez, 36 F.3d 212, 226 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, ----, 115 S.Ct. 947, 1322, 130 L.Ed.2d 891, 202 (1995);  St. Cyr, 977 F.2d at 705.   Second, a sentencing judge's finding of materiality is reviewed only for clear error.   See United States v. Biyaga, 9 F.3d 204, 205 (1st Cir.1993);  United States v. Pineda, 981 F.2d 569, 574-75 (1st Cir.1992).   Third, the Sentencing Commission defines \"material\" evidence in this context as evidence that \"would tend to influence or affect the issue under determination.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1, comment.  (n. 5) (Nov.1994);  see also United States v. Kelley, 76 F.3d 436, 441 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These three principles counsel rejection of the defendant's assignment of error.   The papers that the defendant burned were material if they could have influenced or affected the official investigation into his fraud.   If those papers included the Rabbs' bank statements and checks (which the defendant had intercepted and which were never located), they were obviously material.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  If, however, the papers included the defendant's written apologia to the Rabbs, then they were also material.   A letter of apology to the victims of a crime, even in draft form, is tantamount to a confession of guilt.   Had this voluntary confession, in the defendant's handwriting, been uncovered in his home on that October afternoon, it would have had the potential to influence the investigation of the fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, all roads lead to Rome.   Regardless of which version of events the sentencing court believed, both entailed the destruction of material evidence in the face of a known investigation.   Thus, we descry no clear error in the sentencing court's determination that the defendant's burning of evidence--whether bank records or letters of apology--warranted an upward adjustment under section 3C1.1.   By the same token, the district court did not err in declining to spin the web more finely by making a particularized finding as to the exact nature of the documents that were burned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion likewise stills the defendant's cry that the district court abused its discretion when it failed to hold an evidentiary hearing to resolve the factual dispute concerning the nature of the burned documents.   Because the defendant destroyed evidence material to the investigation on either version of the facts, the evidentiary hearing that he demanded would have amounted to an empty charade.   A district court need not--indeed, should not--hold an evidentiary hearing when nothing will turn on it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Fifth Amendment.   The defendant's backup argument on obstruction of justice involves a strained interpretation of the constitutional right against compelled self-incrimination.   He posits that the papers he burned were personal papers--letters of apology--not prepared in the course of committing the offense, and he asseverates that it was his constitutional right to incinerate these personal papers in order to avoid incriminating himself.   This argument misconstrues the protections that the Fifth Amendment offers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The law is clear that, though the Fifth Amendment protects against the compelled preparation of incriminating documents as well as the compelled production of private documents when the act of production itself is incriminating, the Amendment does not act as a general bar to the production of private information voluntarily prepared.   See United States v. Doe, 465 U.S. 605, 610-11, 104 S.Ct. 1237, 1240-42, 79 L.Ed.2d 552 (1984);  Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 391, 400-01, 96 S.Ct. 1569, 1575-76, 48 L.Ed.2d 39 (1976).   Once an individual chooses voluntarily to prepare a written account, the act of preparation serves as an effective waiver of the Fifth Amendment's protections.   See Doe, 465 U.S. at 610-11, 104 S.Ct. at 1240-42.   In other words, just as a defendant cannot begin to testify at trial and then change his mind, a suspect cannot create a testimonial communication embodying incriminating admissions and then choose to destroy it when he knows that it has become relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the defendant concedes that he voluntarily prepared letters of apology, but he claims a privilege on the basis that the letters were private papers unrelated to the commission of the crime.   This point does not aid the defendant's quest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fifth Amendment does not deal with the privacy of the contents of documents, but, rather, with the voluntariness of their preparation and production.   See Fisher, 425 U.S. at 401, 96 S.Ct. at 1576.   This court has stated that if the privilege against self-incrimination applies at all to the contents of private papers, it does so \"only in rare situations, where compelled disclosure would break the heart of our sense of privacy.\"  In re Grand Jury Subpoena, 973 F.2d 45, 51 (1st Cir.1992) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).   The defendant's letters, as he describes them, do not fit this mold.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant goes one step further when he suggests that the privilege against self-incrimination includes the right to destroy voluntarily prepared documents.   Otherwise, he maintains, any time a defendant authors personal notes that might aid an investigation, and later decides to eradicate them, the fact of destruction could be used to enhance his punishment.   This may be so--but the contention that such a rule violates the privilege against self-inculpation distorts the contours of the Fifth Amendment.   There is simply no constitutional right to destroy evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court made the point bluntly in Segura v. United States, 468 U.S. 796, 104 S.Ct. 3380, 82 L.Ed.2d 599 (1984).   There the Court stated that the very idea of such a right \"defies both logic and common sense.\"  Id. at 816, 104 S.Ct. at 3391;  accord United States v. Corral-Corral, 899 F.2d 927, 930 (10th Cir.1990);  Hancock v. Nelson, 363 F.2d 249, 254 (1st Cir.1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 984, 87 S.Ct. 1292, 18 L.Ed.2d 234 (1967).   Though a person ordinarily may refuse to prepare or produce any evidence that is self-incriminating, see, e.g., Andresen v. Maryland, 427 U.S. 463, 475, 96 S.Ct. 2737, 2745-46, 49 L.Ed.2d 627 (1976), that privilege in no way suggests that the person may take affirmative action to destroy evidence--even evidence that he himself has created--once he is aware that authorities are searching for it (or something like it).   That act of affirmative misconduct, undertaken with the intent of hindering an extant investigation, is the paradigmatic example of an obstruction of justice.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1, comment.  (n. 3(d)) (Nov.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do the sentencing guidelines provide a special layer of swaddling.   To be sure, the Sentencing Commission wrote that the enhancement for obstruction of justice \"is not intended to punish a defendant for the exercise of a constitutional right.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1, comment.  (n. 1) (Nov.1994).   This reminder of Fifth Amendment safeguards simply means that the enhancement should not apply to a defendant who does no more than stand upon his rights, say, by maintaining his silence or refusing voluntarily to disclose evidence of his guilt.   See Thomas W. Hutchison &amp; David Yellen, Federal Sentencing Law and Practice &#167; 3C1.1 author's comment 4 (1994).   Affirmative misconduct, however, is the intended target of the obstruction-of-justice enhancement, and, as such, increasing a defendant's sentence for affirmative misconduct does not trespass upon protected terrain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the defendant's act of burning incriminating documents was not shielded by the Fifth Amendment even if those documents comprised personal papers that he himself created.   Hence, the sentencing court did not err when it applied the section 3C1.1 enhancement in this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>B. Vulnerable Victims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Feldman's second assignment of error calumnizes the district court's imposition of a two-level upward adjustment attributable to the Rabbs' status as vulnerable victims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Generic Traits.   The defendant's first sally--which contends that the sentencing court applied the wrong legal standard because it based the enhancement on the Rabbs' membership in a generic class of elderly persons rather than on some individualized vulnerability that they might have possessed--need not occupy us for long.   We are in general agreement with the defendant's premise:  in determining the propriety of an upward adjustment for vulnerability, the sentencing court's sights must be trained on the victim's individual characteristics.   Thus, in order to warrant a finding of unusual vulnerability, there must be some evidence, above and beyond mere membership in a large class, that the victim possessed a special weakness that the defendant exploited.   See United States v. Smith, 930 F.2d 1450, 1455 (10th Cir.)  (holding that advanced age, without more, does not render a victim unusually vulnerable), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 879, 112 S.Ct. 225, 116 L.Ed.2d 182 (1991);  see also United States v. Rowe, 999 F.2d 14, 17 (1st Cir.1993) (cautioning that courts cannot predicate a finding of unusual vulnerability on generalizations about large classes to which the victim belongs).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to the defendant's importuning, the record reflects that the district court apprehended and applied the standard enunciated above.   This conclusion is buttressed in two separate ways.   First, at the sentencing hearing Judge Gorton explicitly found (a) that \"the defendant knew that the victim, Norman Rabb, was elderly and that his mental faculties were failing \" (emphasis supplied), and (b) that the defendant proceeded to exploit this condition.   Second, the judge expressly adopted the factual findings contained in the PSI Report--a document that made clear, inter alia, that Mr. Rabb was physically debilitated and that the Rabbs were unable to handle their personal finances.   We have accepted such findings as long as the purport and intent of the sentencing court is clear.   See United States v. Savoie, 985 F.2d 612, 620 (1st Cir.1993).   These adopted findings qualify under that test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more would be supererogatory.   The record simply does not bear out the claim that the sentencing court applied the enhancement only because the Rabbs were octogenarians or shared certain generic aspects of a class of elderly persons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Targeting.   The defendant also contends that the sentencing court erred in applying section 3A1.1 because the government did not show that he targeted the Rabbs due to their particular vulnerability to the planned fraud.   This argument prescinds from the Sentencing Commission's advisory (now revoked, but in effect on the date of Feldman's sentencing) that the adjustment here in question \"applies to offenses where an unusually vulnerable victim is made a target of criminal activity by the defendant.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 3A1.1, comment.  (n. 1) (Nov.1994).   The defendant maintains that, unless we are prepared to disregard Rowe 's interpretation of the \"target\" language, the government must demonstrate that the offender selected his victims because of some \"special susceptibility.\"  Rowe, 999 F.2d at 17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A backward glance helps to place this asseveration into perspective.   Application Note 1, in its pre-1995 form, proved to be controversial.   In particular, the \"target\" language split the circuits on the issue of whether the government had to prove that the defendant was motivated by the victim's special vulnerability in order to lay a foundation for the upward adjustment, see, e.g., United States v. Smith, 39 F.3d 119, 124 (6th Cir.1994);  United States v. Cree, 915 F.2d 352, 354 (8th Cir.1990), or whether the government merely had to show that the defendant targeted his victim with the knowledge (actual or constructive) that the victim was unusually vulnerable, see, e.g., United States v. O'Brien, 50 F.3d 751, 754-55 (9th Cir.1995).   Dictum in Rowe tended to edge this court toward the former view.   See Rowe, 999 F.2d at 17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not probe the point more deeply.   For purposes of the case at hand, the dispute is academic;  either way, the proof suffices.   As for future cases, the Sentencing Commission has removed all reasonable doubt by amending the commentary to section 3A1.1.   In an effort to resolve \"some inconsistency in the application of &#167; 3A1.1 regarding whether this adjustment required proof that the defendant had 'targeted the victim on account of the victim's vulnerability,' \" U.S.S.G.App. C., Amend. 521, at 430 (Nov.1995), the Commission deleted the \"target\" language.   The revised note merely states that the vulnerable victim provision \"applies to offenses involving an unusually vulnerable victim in which the defendant knows or should have known of the victim's unusual vulnerability.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 3A1.1, comment.  (n. 2) (Nov.1995).   In future cases this provision, not our statements in Rowe, will govern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying Rowe generously, i.e., assuming arguendo, favorably to Feldman, that targeting was an essential element of the government's proof, the defendant's argument founders.  Rowe merely requires that a special susceptibility have been a factor in the offender's process of selecting his prey.   See id. at 16-17 &amp; n. 3.   This means that the government did not need to prove here that the defendant set out to defraud elderly, infirm people, and targeted the Rabbs because they fit the bill.   It also means that the government did not need to prove that the Rabbs' infirmities were the sole reason that the defendant zeroed in on them.   Even under the Rowe regime, expansively construed, the government had to show only that the defendant selected the Rabbs as his victims in part because they were elderly and infirm.   See Cree, 915 F.2d at 354 (explaining that \"enhancing a defendant's sentence based on victim vulnerability is justified only when a defendant's actions in some way exploited or took advantage of that vulnerability\") (emphasis supplied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record in this case contains more than enough evidence to justify a finding that the defendant targeted the Rabbs because of their vulnerability.   After all, he entered the Rabbs' employ only because of their infirmity and, in his capacity as a home care assistant, he gained copious knowledge of their afflictions.   Knowing of their diminished capacity, he obtained information necessary to carry out his plot.   Given these and other facts, we believe that the record establishes a nexus between victims' susceptibility and victimizer's criminality adequate to establish targeting.   See United States v. Pavao, 948 F.2d 74, 78 (1st Cir.1991).   Thus, the district court's finding that the defendant targeted his victims on account of their age and infirmity warrants our approbation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.   Here, the defendant selected his victims because he had been their personal caretaker and had discovered their vulnerabilities at first hand.   The victims were elderly, in failing health, and no longer in control of their finances.   The defendant enacted his scheme with full knowledge that these vulnerabilities would make his crime easier to accomplish.   Consequently, the district court did not clearly err in determining that the Rabbs were vulnerable victims within the scope of U.S.S.G. &#167; 3A1.1, and that the defendant had targeted them on that basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> This guideline directs a two-level increase \"[i]f the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1 (Nov.1994)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The defendant claims somewhat unconvincingly that he \"lost\" all the bank records and checks belonging to the Rabbs</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The defendant also contends that the district court erred in failing to make a factual finding that the defendant acted willfully and with specific intent to avoid responsibility for the fraud.   This contention misperceives the record.

Using the version of the guidelines that was in effect on that date, see United States v. Harotunian, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552769\"><a href=\"/opinion/552769/united-states-v-dennis-harotunian/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1040</span></a></span>, 1041-42 (1st Cir.1990), the court computed the guideline sentencing range (GSR) at 30-37 months and imposed a 33-month incarcerative sentence.

OVERVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We draw an overview of the facts necessary to shed light on this appeal from the Presentence Investigation Report (PSI Report) and the transcript of the disposition hearing.   See United States v. Dietz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572657\"><a href=\"/opinion/572657/united-states-v-william-a-dietz/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 51 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant worked for Norman and Eleanor Rabb as a home attendant from May to October of 1993, assisting them with their personal care.   The Rabbs were octogenarians.   In addition, Mr. Rabb was in failing health and afflicted by a deteriorating mental condition.   The couple could not handle their personal finances and a long-time retainer, herself seventy-eight years old, wrote checks to pay their household expenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the course of his employment, the defendant became privy to the Rabbs' finances.   Having obtained Mr. Rabb's social security number and the account numbers for a Fidelity Investments trust account and a Bank of Boston checking account, he set out to defraud the Rabbs upon leaving their employ.   His modus operandi involved siphoning funds from both the trust and checking accounts by impersonating Mr. Rabb, forging negotiable instruments, and similar artifices.   To cover his tracks, he submitted to the postal service change of address forms directing that all the Rabbs' business mail be forwarded to the address of his own dwelling.   The defendant then retained the mail that would have revealed his skulduggery (such as the monthly trust account statements) and forwarded the remainder to the Rabbs to quell any suspicions.   All told, the defendant pilfered $139,972.00 from the trust account and $59,423.68 from the checking account before his shenanigans were discovered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant challenges two rulings made by the district court in constructing the GSR.

In requesting the two-level enhancement the government argued that the defendant burned bank statements and checks belonging to the Rabbs in his fireplace on October 13, 1994, after learning that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had launched an investigation.   The defendant admitted that he had destroyed documents after learning of the investigation.   He nonetheless objected to the upward adjustment on the basis that he had not burned financial data but had only burned drafts of a will and letters of apology that he had written (though not mailed) to the Rabbs.   The district court did not choose between these versions but stated in effect that, on either version, the enhancement applied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.   Adequacy of Findings.   The defendant asserts that the district court erred in leaving unresolved the factual controversy concerning what the flames consumed.   We review a sentencing court's factual findings under section 3C1.1 for clear error, see United States v. Aymelek, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556393\"><a href=\"/opinion/556393/united-states-v-kaya-aymelek/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span>, 68 (1st Cir.1991), but we afford plenary review to essentially legal determinations (such as whether section 3C1.1 includes a defendant's allegedly obstructive conduct within its scope), see United States v. Emery, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"605526\"><a href=\"/opinion/605526/united-states-v-charles-e-emery/\"><span class=\"volume\">991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">907</span></a></span>, 910 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a defendant alleges that a PSI Report contains a factual inaccuracy, the district court ordinarily must either make a finding, up or down, as to the allegation, or else determine that no finding is necessary because the controverted matter will not be taken into consideration in connection with, or will not affect, the sentencing decision.   See Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(1);  see also U.S.S.G. &#167; 6A1.3 (Nov.1994).   Thus, the sentencing court need not resolve factual conflicts when doing so will serve no useful purpose.   See United States v. Fuentes-Vazquez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196040\"><a href=\"/opinion/196040/united-states-v-fuentes-vazquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">394</span></a></span>, 397 (1st Cir.1995);  see also United States v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">840</span></span> (1994).   The instant case exemplifies the point:  the judge was not obliged to choose between the two conflicting accounts if under either version the documents constituted material evidence.   We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given that the defendant knew of the ongoing FBI probe and nonetheless intentionally incinerated documents, the only question that remained was whether the documents in the pyre were material to the investigation.   See United States v. St. Cyr, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593172\"><a href=\"/opinion/593172/united-states-v-john-l-st-cyr/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">698</span></a></span>, 705 (1st Cir.1992) (explaining that a defendant's actions must impede the government's investigation in some material way to trigger an obstruction enhancement).   The bank records that the government described plainly met the test for materiality.   In the alternative, the government argued that even if the defendant had been toasting letters of apology, those letters would also be material and, hence, the defendant would still be guilty of an obstruction of justice within the contemplation of section 3C1.1.   The record indicates that the lower court accepted this reasoning.   The court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>[T]he defendant burned certain material after he knew about the investigation that was in progress and that he did so in this Court's mind with an idea of preventing the Government from obtaining relevant material evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three principles guide our review of this determination.   First, the test for materiality under the obstruction-of-justice guideline is not stringent.   See United States v. Ovalle-Marquez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195633\"><a href=\"/opinion/195633/united-states-v-ovalle-marquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></a></span>, 226 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">947</span></span>, 1322, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">891</span></span>, 202 (1995);  St. Cyr, 977 F.2d at 705.   Second, a sentencing judge's finding of materiality is reviewed only for clear error.   See United States v. Biyaga, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195032\"><a href=\"/opinion/195032/united-states-v-biyaga/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">204</span></a></span>, 205 (1st Cir.1993);  United States v. Pineda, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596482\"><a href=\"/opinion/596482/united-states-v-ramon-pineda/\"><span class=\"volume\">981</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">569</span></a></span>, 574-75 (1st Cir.1992).   Third, the Sentencing Commission defines \"material\" evidence in this context as evidence that \"would tend to influence or affect the issue under determination.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1, comment.  (n. 5) (Nov.1994);  see also United States v. Kelley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196587\"><a href=\"/opinion/196587/united-states-v-kelley/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span>, 441 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These three principles counsel rejection of the defendant's assignment of error.   The papers that the defendant burned were material if they could have influenced or affected the official investigation into his fraud.   If those papers included the Rabbs' bank statements and checks (which the defendant had intercepted and which were never located), they were obviously material.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  If, however, the papers included the defendant's written apologia to the Rabbs, then they were also material.   A letter of apology to the victims of a crime, even in draft form, is tantamount to a confession of guilt.   Had this voluntary confession, in the defendant's handwriting, been uncovered in his home on that October afternoon, it would have had the potential to influence the investigation of the fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, all roads lead to Rome.   Regardless of which version of events the sentencing court believed, both entailed the destruction of material evidence in the face of a known investigation.   Thus, we descry no clear error in the sentencing court's determination that the defendant's burning of evidence--whether bank records or letters of apology--warranted an upward adjustment under section 3C1.1.   By the same token, the district court did not err in declining to spin the web more finely by making a particularized finding as to the exact nature of the documents that were burned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion likewise stills the defendant's cry that the district court abused its discretion when it failed to hold an evidentiary hearing to resolve the factual dispute concerning the nature of the burned documents.   Because the defendant destroyed evidence material to the investigation on either version of the facts, the evidentiary hearing that he demanded would have amounted to an empty charade.   A district court need not--indeed, should not--hold an evidentiary hearing when nothing will turn on it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Fifth Amendment.   The defendant's backup argument on obstruction of justice involves a strained interpretation of the constitutional right against compelled self-incrimination.   He posits that the papers he burned were personal papers--letters of apology--not prepared in the course of committing the offense, and he asseverates that it was his constitutional right to incinerate these personal papers in order to avoid incriminating himself.   This argument misconstrues the protections that the Fifth Amendment offers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The law is clear that, though the Fifth Amendment protects against the compelled preparation of incriminating documents as well as the compelled production of private documents when the act of production itself is incriminating, the Amendment does not act as a general bar to the production of private information voluntarily prepared.   See United States v. Doe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111110\"><a href=\"/opinion/111110/united-states-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">605</span></a></span>, 610-11, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111110\"><a href=\"/opinion/111110/united-states-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span> (1976).   Once an individual chooses voluntarily to prepare a written account, the act of preparation serves as an effective waiver of the Fifth Amendment's protections.   See Doe, 465 U.S. at 610-11, 104 S.Ct. at 1240-42.   In other words, just as a defendant cannot begin to testify at trial and then change his mind, a suspect cannot create a testimonial communication embodying incriminating admissions and then choose to destroy it when he knows that it has become relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the defendant concedes that he voluntarily prepared letters of apology, but he claims a privilege on the basis that the letters were private papers unrelated to the commission of the crime.   This point does not aid the defendant's quest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fifth Amendment does not deal with the privacy of the contents of documents, but, rather, with the voluntariness of their preparation and production.   See Fisher, 425 U.S. at 401, 96 S.Ct. at 1576.   This court has stated that if the privilege against self-incrimination applies at all to the contents of private papers, it does so \"only in rare situations, where compelled disclosure would break the heart of our sense of privacy.\"  In re Grand Jury Subpoena, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"589649\"><a href=\"/opinion/589649/in-re-grand-jury-subpoena/\"><span class=\"volume\">973</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 51 (1st Cir.1992) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).   The defendant's letters, as he describes them, do not fit this mold.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant goes one step further when he suggests that the privilege against self-incrimination includes the right to destroy voluntarily prepared documents.   Otherwise, he maintains, any time a defendant authors personal notes that might aid an investigation, and later decides to eradicate them, the fact of destruction could be used to enhance his punishment.   This may be so--but the contention that such a rule violates the privilege against self-inculpation distorts the contours of the Fifth Amendment.   There is simply no constitutional right to destroy evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court made the point bluntly in Segura v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">627</span></a></span> (1976), that privilege in no way suggests that the person may take affirmative action to destroy evidence--even evidence that he himself has created--once he is aware that authorities are searching for it (or something like it).   That act of affirmative misconduct, undertaken with the intent of hindering an extant investigation, is the paradigmatic example of an obstruction of justice.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1, comment.  (n. 3(d)) (Nov.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do the sentencing guidelines provide a special layer of swaddling.   To be sure, the Sentencing Commission wrote that the enhancement for obstruction of justice \"is not intended to punish a defendant for the exercise of a constitutional right.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1, comment.  (n. 1) (Nov.1994).   This reminder of Fifth Amendment safeguards simply means that the enhancement should not apply to a defendant who does no more than stand upon his rights, say, by maintaining his silence or refusing voluntarily to disclose evidence of his guilt.   See Thomas W. Hutchison &amp; David Yellen, Federal Sentencing Law and Practice &#167; 3C1.1 author's comment 4 (1994).   Affirmative misconduct, however, is the intended target of the obstruction-of-justice enhancement, and, as such, increasing a defendant's sentence for affirmative misconduct does not trespass upon protected terrain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the defendant's act of burning incriminating documents was not shielded by the Fifth Amendment even if those documents comprised personal papers that he himself created.   Hence, the sentencing court did not err when it applied the section 3C1.1 enhancement in this case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>B.

Generic Traits.   The defendant's first sally--which contends that the sentencing court applied the wrong legal standard because it based the enhancement on the Rabbs' membership in a generic class of elderly persons rather than on some individualized vulnerability that they might have possessed--need not occupy us for long.   We are in general agreement with the defendant's premise:  in determining the propriety of an upward adjustment for vulnerability, the sentencing court's sights must be trained on the victim's individual characteristics.   Thus, in order to warrant a finding of unusual vulnerability, there must be some evidence, above and beyond mere membership in a large class, that the victim possessed a special weakness that the defendant exploited.   See United States v. Smith, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"559571\"><a href=\"/opinion/559571/united-states-v-stan-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">930</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1450</span></a></span>, 1455 (10th Cir.)

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">182</span></span> (1991);  see also United States v. Rowe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"611607\"><a href=\"/opinion/611607/united-states-v-richard-l-rowe/\"><span class=\"volume\">999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1993) (cautioning that courts cannot predicate a finding of unusual vulnerability on generalizations about large classes to which the victim belongs).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to the defendant's importuning, the record reflects that the district court apprehended and applied the standard enunciated above.   This conclusion is buttressed in two separate ways.   First, at the sentencing hearing Judge Gorton explicitly found (a) that \"the defendant knew that the victim, Norman Rabb, was elderly and that his mental faculties were failing \" (emphasis supplied), and (b) that the defendant proceeded to exploit this condition.   Second, the judge expressly adopted the factual findings contained in the PSI Report--a document that made clear, inter alia, that Mr. Rabb was physically debilitated and that the Rabbs were unable to handle their personal finances.   We have accepted such findings as long as the purport and intent of the sentencing court is clear.   See United States v. Savoie, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600257\"><a href=\"/opinion/600257/united-states-v-paul-j-savoie/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">612</span></a></span>, 620 (1st Cir.1993).   These adopted findings qualify under that test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more would be supererogatory.   The record simply does not bear out the claim that the sentencing court applied the enhancement only because the Rabbs were octogenarians or shared certain generic aspects of a class of elderly persons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Targeting.   The defendant also contends that the sentencing court erred in applying section 3A1.1 because the government did not show that he targeted the Rabbs due to their particular vulnerability to the planned fraud.   This argument prescinds from the Sentencing Commission's advisory (now revoked, but in effect on the date of Feldman's sentencing) that the adjustment here in question \"applies to offenses where an unusually vulnerable victim is made a target of criminal activity by the defendant.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 3A1.1, comment.  (n. 1) (Nov.1994).   The defendant maintains that, unless we are prepared to disregard Rowe 's interpretation of the \"target\" language, the government must demonstrate that the offender selected his victims because of some \"special susceptibility.\"  Rowe, 999 F.2d at 17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A backward glance helps to place this asseveration into perspective.   Application Note 1, in its pre-1995 form, proved to be controversial.   In particular, the \"target\" language split the circuits on the issue of whether the government had to prove that the defendant was motivated by the victim's special vulnerability in order to lay a foundation for the upward adjustment, see, e.g., United States v. Smith, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"681338\"><a href=\"/opinion/681338/united-states-v-priscilla-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">119</span></a></span>, 124 (6th Cir.1994);  United States v. Cree, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548738\"><a href=\"/opinion/548738/united-states-v-melvin-francis-cree-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">352</span></a></span>, 354 (8th Cir.1990), or whether the government merely had to show that the defendant targeted his victim with the knowledge (actual or constructive) that the victim was unusually vulnerable, see, e.g., United States v. O'Brien, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"692045\"><a href=\"/opinion/692045/united-states-v-thomas-m-obrien-united-states-of-america-v-edward-b/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">751</span></a></span>, 754-55 (9th Cir.1995).   Dictum in Rowe tended to edge this court toward the former view.   See Rowe, 999 F.2d at 17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not probe the point more deeply.   For purposes of the case at hand, the dispute is academic;  either way, the proof suffices.   As for future cases, the Sentencing Commission has removed all reasonable doubt by amending the commentary to section 3A1.1.   In an effort to resolve \"some inconsistency in the application of &#167; 3A1.1 regarding whether this adjustment required proof that the defendant had 'targeted the victim on account of the victim's vulnerability,' \" U.S.S.G.App. C., Amend. 521, at 430 (Nov.1995), the Commission deleted the \"target\" language.   The revised note merely states that the vulnerable victim provision \"applies to offenses involving an unusually vulnerable victim in which the defendant knows or should have known of the victim's unusual vulnerability.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 3A1.1, comment.  (n. 2) (Nov.1995).   In future cases this provision, not our statements in Rowe, will govern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying Rowe generously, i.e., assuming arguendo, favorably to Feldman, that targeting was an essential element of the government's proof, the defendant's argument founders.  Rowe merely requires that a special susceptibility have been a factor in the offender's process of selecting his prey.   See id. at 16-17 &amp; n. 3.   This means that the government did not need to prove here that the defendant set out to defraud elderly, infirm people, and targeted the Rabbs because they fit the bill.   It also means that the government did not need to prove that the Rabbs' infirmities were the sole reason that the defendant zeroed in on them.   Even under the Rowe regime, expansively construed, the government had to show only that the defendant selected the Rabbs as his victims in part because they were elderly and infirm.   See Cree, 915 F.2d at 354 (explaining that \"enhancing a defendant's sentence based on victim vulnerability is justified only when a defendant's actions in some way exploited or took advantage of that vulnerability\") (emphasis supplied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record in this case contains more than enough evidence to justify a finding that the defendant targeted the Rabbs because of their vulnerability.   After all, he entered the Rabbs' employ only because of their infirmity and, in his capacity as a home care assistant, he gained copious knowledge of their afflictions.   Knowing of their diminished capacity, he obtained information necessary to carry out his plot.   Given these and other facts, we believe that the record establishes a nexus between victims' susceptibility and victimizer's criminality adequate to establish targeting.   See United States v. Pavao, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"571260\"><a href=\"/opinion/571260/united-states-v-luis-m-pavao/\"><span class=\"volume\">948</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span>, 78 (1st Cir.1991).   Thus, the district court's finding that the defendant targeted his victims on account of their age and infirmity warrants our approbation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.   Here, the defendant selected his victims because he had been their personal caretaker and had discovered their vulnerabilities at first hand.   The victims were elderly, in failing health, and no longer in control of their finances.   The defendant enacted his scheme with full knowledge that these vulnerabilities would make his crime easier to accomplish.   Consequently, the district court did not clearly err in determining that the Rabbs were vulnerable victims within the scope of U.S.S.G. &#167; 3A1.1, and that the defendant had targeted them on that basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> This guideline directs a two-level increase \"[i]f the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 3C1.1 (Nov.1994)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The defendant claims somewhat unconvincingly that he \"lost\" all the bank records and checks belonging to the Rabbs</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The defendant also contends that the district court erred in failing to make a factual finding that the defendant acted willfully and with specific intent to avoid responsibility for the fraud.   This contention misperceives the record.   Judge Gorton did make an explicit finding of specific intent, noting that the defendant's act of burning documents occurred \"after he knew about the investigation that was in progress\" and that the defendant had in mind \"an idea of preventing the Government from obtaining relevant material evidence.\"   We require no greater precision from a sentencing court.   See United States v. Gonzales, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195106\"><a href=\"/opinion/195106/united-states-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">298</span></a></span>, 299-300 (1st Cir.1993)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> At oral argument defense counsel suggested that the Fifth Amendment applied here because the letters were preliminary drafts rather than finished products.   We do not consider that argument.   It was not made below, it was not made in the briefs, and it was not developed at any time.   It is, therefore, triply waived</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The guidelines provide for a two-level upward adjustment when an offender \"knew or should have known that a victim of the offense was unusually vulnerable due to age, physical or mental condition, or that a victim was otherwise particularly susceptible to the criminal conduct.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 3A1.1 (Nov.1994)</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
