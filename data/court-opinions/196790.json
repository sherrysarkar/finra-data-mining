We have carefully reviewed defendant's\r                                \r\r\n\nappellate arguments, and, finding no merit in them, we affirm\r\n\nthe sentence imposed by the district court.\r\n\n     Contrary to  defendant's first argument,   both the form\r\n\nand the substance of the district court's findings adequately\r\n\nsupport  the  two-level  enhancement under  USSG    3B1.1(c).\r\n\nSpecifically, the  formal requirement of 18  U.S.C.   3553(c)\r\n\nwas  satisfied  by  the  district  court's  adoption  of  the\r\n\nunambiguous and  undisputed PSR.  That  report indicated that\r\n\ndefendant committed  to and executed the sales by himself and\r\n\nthrough  others,  supplied  the  drugs,  and  supervised   or\r\n\ndirected at least  one other person (e.g., \"Anna\"  and Mota),\r                                                     \r\n\nso  that  defendant's  role   in  the  offense  was  properly\r\n\ncharacterized  as  supervisory  or managerial.

Defendant only  indicated a conditional\r\n\nagreement  to   plead  guilty  some  six   months  after  his\r\n\narraignment and when the  government was already prepared for\r\n\ntrial;  he  renounced  the agreement  that  was  subsequently\r\n\nnegotiated;  and he  did not  enter his  plea until  some ten\r\n\nmonths after arraignment.
