Joseph L. Tauro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                     Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n               Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                  and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Stephen F. Reardon on brief for appellant.\n     Edward J. Barshak and Sugarman, Rogers, Barshak & Cohen,\nP.C. on brief for appellee.\n\f           Per Curiam.      This personal injury action arises out of\n\na highway accident that occurred in Texas.             The district court\n\ndetermined      that   it   lacked   personal     jurisdiction    over        the\n\ndefendant, a Texas firm, and dismissed the action on that basis.\n\nThe   court     thereafter    denied       the   plaintiff's    motion        for\n\nreconsideration.\n\n           We have scoured the record and carefully considered the\n\nparties' briefs and arguments.         We conclude that this appeal is\n\ntimely only as to the district court's denial of the plaintiff's\n\nmotion for reconsideration. 1          See Rodriguez-Antuna v. Chase\n\nManhattan Bank, 871 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1989).                   Given the\n\nexiguous showing made by the plaintiff, that denial plainly was\n\nwithin    the    district    court's   discretion.        See    id.     at     3\n\n(\"Plaintiffs, if they had a case to make, should have made it in\n\na timely fashion.\").\n\n           We add, moreover, that even if we were to consider the\n\nunderlying question of personal jurisdiction, we would uphold\n\n\n      1\n     While a motion to alter or amend a judgment may toll the\nrunning of the appeal period, the plaintiff's motion for\nreconsideration was not filed within ten days of the date of the\nentry of the judgment and, thus, did not operate to toll the\nappeal period.    See Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) (fixing ten-day\nwindow). Since the plaintiff's notice of appeal was filed more\nthan thirty days after the date of entry of judgment, it is\nuntimely vis-à-vis the judgment. See Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1).\nThe notice of appeal was, however, filed within thirty days of\nthe district court's denial of the motion for reconsideration.\nIt is, therefore, timely as to that order.\n\n                                     -2-\n\fthe   district   court's   order   of    dismissal.   The   plaintiff's\n\nreliance on the unsupported allegations in her complaint and\n\nmemorandum in opposition to the motion to dismiss is manifestly\n\ninsufficient to make out a prima facie case for             in personam\n\njurisdiction.    See, e.g., Barrett v. Lombardi, 239 F.3d 23, 26-\n\n27 (1st Cir. 2001); Boit v. Gar-Tec Prods., Inc., 967 F.2d 671,\n\n675 (1st Cir. 1992); see also Donatelli v. Nat'l Hockey League,\n\n893 F.2d 459, 463 (1st Cir. 1990) (explaining that a finding of\n\ngeneral personal jurisdiction requires a showing of \"continuous\n\nand systematic contacts\" with the forum state).\n\n            We need go no further.       This appeal is groundless and,\n\ntherefore, the judgment below may be summarily affirmed.            See\n\n1st Cir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f",
