Gibson, Senior  Circuit Judge.   Vinson Mangos\r                                                          \r\n\nappeals from  a sentence imposed  upon him  following his  guilty\r\n\nplea to  transferring a firearm knowing that  it would be used to\r\n\ncommit  a drug  trafficking crime,  in violation  of 18  U.S.C.  \r\n\n924(h)  (1994).   He contends  that the  district court  erred in\r\n\nimposing an eighty-eight month sentence.  He argues that: (1) his\r\n\nearlier assault  conviction in  a Massachusetts court  was not  a\r\n\ncrime  of violence  under  the  sentencing  guidelines;  (2)  the\r\n\ndistrict  court misinterpreted the guidelines in its treatment of\r\n\nthis issue; (3)  the district court erred  as a matter of  law in\r\n\nnot  departing  downward  because of  the  overcounting  of prior\r\n\noffenses;  and (4) in  not granting him a role  reduction because\r\n\nhe  was the  least  culpable  of the  various  participants.   We\r\n\naffirm.\r\n\n          The primary issues in this appeal  are the attacks upon\r\n\nthe sentence,  and  thus an  abbreviated  outline of  the  events\r\n\ngiving  rise to  his  guilty  plea suffices.    Mangos and  three\r\n\nothers, Gordon Higgins, Cathy Tremblay, and Luis Morey, attempted\r\n\nto rob John Collins, whom they believed was selling crack cocaine\r\n\nfrom  his trailer.   In  doing  so, Mangos  carried his  20-gauge\r\n\nshotgun with  a pistol grip  when he, Higgins, and  Morey entered\r\n\nCollins's trailer.  This robbery attempt was aborted. \r\n\n          Four  days  later  Mangos  declined  to  join  Higgins,\r\n\nTremblay,  and Morey  in  a  second effort  to  rob Collins,  but\r\n\nallowed  Higgins to use his shotgun, knowing that Higgins planned\r\n\nto use it in the robbery.   Collins fled through a window but the\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nrobbers  injured Collins's  girlfriend, Jennifer  Hanscomb.   The\r\n\nrobbers found no drugs and left the trailer.\r\n\n          Mangos  was charged with a  drug conspiracy count and a\r\n\ncount for  the use  of a  firearm in  a  drug trafficking  crime.\r\n\nThese  charges were  dismissed  when  Mangos  pleaded  guilty  to\r\n\ntransferring a firearm knowing it would be used to commit a  drug\r\n\ntrafficking crime.\r\n\n          In sentencing Mangos, the  district court assessed  two\r\n\npoints for a 1992 Massachusetts conviction for larceny, one point\r\n\nfor a 1992  assault and battery under Massachusetts  law, and yet\r\n\nanother  point for a 1992 Massachusetts conviction for possession\r\n\nof crack cocaine.   A 1994 Maine conviction  for assault resulted\r\n\nin  two points,  and a  1994 guilty  plea to  a separate  assault\r\n\ncharge  in Maine  resulted in one  point.   After failing  to pay\r\n\nfines for operating  a vehicle under the influence  of alcohol in\r\n\n1994, Mangos was sentenced to incarceration in lieu of the fines,\r\n\nwhich resulted  in two additional  criminal history points.   The\r\n\nsubtotal of the  criminal history score was nine,  but two points\r\n\nwere added  because Mangos  committed the  offense of  conviction\r\n\nless  than two  years  after  he was  released  from custody  for\r\n\nviolating  his probation  on the  assault  charge.   He thus  had\r\n\neleven  criminal  history  points,  which  gave  him  a  criminal\r\n\ncategory of V.\r\n\n          The district court placed the base offense level at 24.\r\n\nThe  district  court  added four  levels,  producing  an adjusted\r\n\noffense level of 28, because  Mangos transferred the firearm with\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nthe knowledge and intent that it would be used in connection with\r\n\nanother  felony  offense.    With  a  three-level  reduction  for\r\n\nacceptance of responsibility, the total offense level was 25 with\r\n\na criminal history  category of V.  The government made a section\r\n\n5K1.1 motion,  and the district court departed downward by twelve\r\n\nmonths to reach the sentence of eighty-eight months imprisonment,\r\n\nto be followed by  three years of supervised  release and a  $100\r\n\nspecial assessment.\r\n\n                               I.\r                                         I.\r\n\n                               A.\r                                         A.\r\n\n          Mangos  argues  that   the  district  court  erred   in\r\n\ncharacterizing his earlier assault and battery  of Manuel Herrera\r\n\nin Massachusetts  as a  \"crime of violence\"  for the  purposes of\r\n\nsentencing.  Mangos contends that the description in the charging\r\n\ninstrument that he \"did assault and  beat\" Herrera is boilerplate\r\n\nlanguage  and as such  does not sufficiently  distinguish whether\r\n\nthe assault and battery involved violence or merely nonconsensual\r\n\noffensive  touching.  The  government responds that  the language\r\n\n\"assault and beat\" indicates that  the crime involved violence or\r\n\nthreatened violence, and, in any event, created a serious risk of\r\n\npotential injury to another.  \r\n\n          Under  the U.S.  Sentencing  Guidelines Manual  section\r\n\n2K2.1,  a defendant convicted of illegally transferring a firearm\r\n\nis assigned a  base offense level of  24 if the defendant  has at\r\n\nleast two prior felony convictions  of either a crime of violence\r\n\nor a controlled  substance offense, as opposed to  a base offense\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nlevel  of 22  if the defendant  has only one  such prior offense.\r\n\nThe district court determined that Mangos's prior convictions for\r\n\nthe assault and battery of Herrera and the assault and battery of\r\n\nEvagelio Rodr guez qualified  Mangos for the higher  base offense\r\n\nlevel.\r\n\n          Whether the assault and battery of Herrera was a \"crime\r\n\nof violence\"  under the  Sentencing Guidelines is  a question  of\r\n\nlaw,  which we review  de novo.  See  United States v. Fern ndez,\r                                                                          \r\n\n121 F.3d 777, 778 (1st Cir. 1997).   The term \"crime of violence\"\r\n\nis defined in the Sentencing Guidelines as any offense punishable\r\n\nby imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that:\r\n\n            (i) has as an element the  use, attempted\r\n            use, or threatened use of physical  force\r\n            against the person of another, or        \r\n                       (ii)   is   burglary    of   a\r\n            dwelling,  arson,  or  extortion  ...  or\r\n            otherwise involves conduct  that presents\r\n            a  serious  potential  risk  of  physical\r\n            injury to another.\r\n\nU.S.S.G.   4B1.2.   In determining whether a  prior offense meets\r\n\nthis definition, we  take a formal categorical  approach, looking\r\n\nto the statutory formulation of  the crime charged rather than to\r\n\nthe facts  behind the  actual conviction.   See United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nDamon, 127  F.3d 139,  142 (1st Cir.  1997); United States  v. De\r                                                                           \r\n\nJes s, 984 F.2d 21, 23 (1st Cir. 1993).  \r               \r\n\n          Massachusetts statutory law makes assault and battery a\r\n\ncriminal  offense punishable  by  up to  two  and one-half  years\r\n\nimprisonment, but does not define assault and battery.  See Mass.\r                                                                     \r\n\nGen. Laws ch. 265,   13A (1996).  We look to Massachusetts common\r\n\nlaw for the meaning of \"assault and battery.\"  In Commonwealth v.\r                                                                        \r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nBurke, 457 N.E.2d 622 (Mass. 1983), the Supreme Judicial Court of\r               \r\n\nMassachusetts defined  assault as  an \"offer or  attempt to  do a\r\n\nbattery\" and stated that every  battery includes an assault.  Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nat 624 (citations omitted.).  The court in Burke then stated that\r                                                          \r\n\nthe  law of  battery  is bifurcated  into  harmful batteries  and\r\n\noffensive batteries.  Id.\r                                   \r\n\n          We  reject Mangos's contention that because assault and\r\n\nbattery  includes offensive but nonharmful conduct, it should not\r\n\nbe  considered  a  crime  of  violence.    Under  the  Sentencing\r\n\nGuidelines, the term \"crime of  violence\" is not limited to those\r\n\ncrimes for  which violence is  a necessary  element, but  instead\r\n\nextends  to  any  crime which  \"otherwise  involves  conduct that\r\n\npresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\"\r\n\nU.S.S.G.   4B1.2(1)(ii).  \r\n\n          In   Fern ndez,   this   court   determined  that   the\r                                  \r\n\nMassachusetts  crime of assault and battery upon a police officer\r\n\nwas  properly  classified  as  a  crime  of  violence  under  the\r\n\nsentencing guidelines.  121  F.3d at 780.  We reasoned, \"While it\r\n\nis true  that  neither violence,  nor  the use  of force,  is  an\r\n\nessential element  of the  crime as  statutorily defined,  still,\r\n\nviolence, the use  of force, and a serious risk  of physical harm\r\n\nare all likely to accompany an assault and battery  upon a police\r\n\nofficer.\"  Id.  While we recognize that the risks inherent in the\r                        \r\n\nassault and battery  upon a police officer may  differ from those\r\n\ninvolved in  a simple  assault and battery,  we believe  that the\r\n\nreasoning in Fern ndez applies with similar force to this case. \r                                \r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n          When  the  state  criminal statute  involves  different\r\n\ntypes of  offenses, some arguably  violent and some not,  we look\r\n\nfirst to the  charging document to  see which type of  offense is\r\n\ninvolved.  See Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 602 (1990);\r                                                \r\n\nDamon, 127 F.3d  at 142-143.  Here, the  charging document states\r               \r\n\nthat Mangos \"did assault and  beat\" Manuel Herrera.  The district\r\n\ncourt, following United States v. Harris, 964 F.2d 1234 (1st Cir.\r                                                  \r\n\n1992), found that  this statement that the assault  amounted to a\r\n\nbeating of Herrera  qualified the crime charged as  a violent and\r\n\nfelony offense.   This places  Mangos's offense into  the harmful\r\n\nbattery  type,  and thus  meets  the  definition  of a  crime  of\r\n\nviolence under  U.S.S.G.   4B1.2.  There is nothing in the record\r\n\nor the charging document that  refers to an offensive touching or\r\n\na touching without consent, such as described in Burke.  \r                                                                \r\n\n                                B.\r                                          B.\r\n\n          Mangos  additionally  argues  that the  district  court\r\n\nerred in counting Mangos's conviction for the assault and battery\r\n\nof  Herrera and  his conviction  for the  assault and  battery of\r\n\nRodr guez as  separate  prior felony  convictions  and  therefore\r\n\nsentencing  Mangos to a base offense level of 24.  Mangos asserts\r\n\nthat  the sentences for these  offenses were related because they\r\n\nwere consolidated for sentencing.   He contends that because  the\r\n\nsentences  were related,  the  offenses should  be  treated as  a\r\n\nsingle  prior  felony  conviction  under  section  2K2.1.    This\r\n\nargument,  however, is based upon a misreading of the guidelines.\r\n\nMangos cites section 4A1.2(a)(2), which states,  \"Prior sentences\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nimposed in  related cases are to  be treated as  one sentence for\r\n\npurposes of    4A1.1(a), (b), and (c).\"   By its own  terms, this\r\n\nprovision   does  not  govern  the  treatment  of  \"prior  felony\r\n\nconvictions\" under section 2K2.1.   As a result, we conclude that\r\n\nMangos's argument regarding related sentences is without merit.  \r\n\n                               II.\r                                         II.\r\n\n          Mangos  contends  that  the  district  court  erred  in\r\n\nincluding his  conviction in a  Maine state court  for assaulting\r\n\nhis  sister as part of  his criminal history  for the purposes of\r\n\nsentencing.  Mangos claims that  the conviction was not counseled\r\n\nand is  not a reliable  indicator that he actually  committed the\r\n\nassault.   The government responds  that the Maine conviction was\r\n\ncounseled and that no basis exists for  rejecting that conviction\r\n\nas  unreliable.   Because the  parties dispute whether  the Maine\r\n\nconviction  was  counseled,  the questions  we  must  address are\r\n\nquestions of  fact.  Therefore,  we review only for  clear error.\r\n\nSee United States v. Goldberg, 105 F.3d 770, 777 (1st Cir. 1997).\r                                       \r\n\n          On November 1, 1993, the State of Maine arrested Mangos\r\n\nfor assaulting  his sister, Roxanna  Mangos.  In March  1994, the\r\n\nstate moved to have the charge \"filed\" with no costs.  Later that\r\n\nyear,  however, the charge  was brought forward  again when Mango\r\n\nwas  also charged  with  operating  a  vehicle  while  under  the\r\n\ninfluence  and operating after suspension.  Mangos pleaded guilty\r\n\nto all of the charges.  Mangos was sentenced to  ten days for the\r\n\nassault,  to be  served concurrently  with a  seven day  sentence\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nimposed for the offenses. \r\n\n          The   current  dispute   arises   from   the  form   of\r\n\nrepresentation Mangos was assigned on  the day he plead guilty to\r\n\nthe above charges.  At the  time Mangos was arraigned, the  state\r\n\ncourt had  a pilot  program known  as \"lawyer  for a  day.\"   The\r\n\npurpose of the  program was  to facilitate  early resolutions  of\r\n\ncases by  allowing people  who were  considering entering  guilty\r\n\npleas to consult with an attorney.  Typically, the lawyer for the\r\n\nday, usually an  experienced criminal defense attorney,  would be\r\n\nassigned to about fifteen defendants.  The lawyer would meet with\r\n\nthe defendants  for anywhere  from five minutes  to a  half hour.\r\n\nDuring  that  time,   the  lawyer  would  review   any  available\r\n\npaperwork,  discuss apparent  defenses,  and negotiate  with  the\r\n\ndistrict attorney.\r\n\n          Mangos   appears   to   argue   that   this   form   of\r\n\nrepresentation was too limited to be considered legal counseling.\r\n\nWe  are  not  persuaded.   Mangos  was  assigned  an  experienced\r\n\ncriminal defense attorney  charged with the professional  duty of\r\n\nzealous advocacy.  Mangos's lawyer appears to have had discretion\r\n\nboth in how  long to consult with  Mangos and in what  courses of\r\n\naction  to advise.  Nothing  indicates that Mangos's attorney was\r\n\nin  any way  prohibited from  advising against  a guilty  plea or\r\n\nsuggesting that Mangos  seek further counsel.  In  light of these\r\n\nfacts, it is clear that Mangos's  claim that he was not counseled\r\n\nis, in actuality, an ineffective  assistance of counsel claim.  A\r\n\nsentencing  court  is  an  inappropriate  forum  for  ineffective\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nassistance of counsel claims addressed to prior convictions.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nCustis v. United States, 511 U.S. 485, 496 (1994). \r                                 \r\n\n          We  also conclude  that  the  Maine  conviction  was  a\r\n\nreliable  indicator  that Mangos  committed the  charged offense.\r\n\nMangos pleaded  guilty to assaulting his sister and was sentenced\r\n\nto ten  days in  prison.  We  refuse to  probe Mangos's  possible\r\n\nmotives for entering that  plea, and accept the guilty plea as an\r\n\nadmission  of guilt.   We hold  that the  district court  did not\r\n\nclearly err in including the Maine conviction as part of Mangos's\r\n\ncriminal history. \r\n\n                               III.\r                                         III.\r\n\n          Mangos  argues that the district court erred in failing\r\n\nto grant  an additional  downward departure  (beyond the  section\r\n\n5K1.1  downward  departure)   under  U.S.S.G.      4A1.3  (Policy\r\n\nStatement).  Section 4A1.3  provides, in part, that  a sentencing\r\n\ncourt  may depart from  the applicable guideline  range when \"the\r\n\ncourt  concludes that  a  defendant's  criminal history  category\r\n\nsignificantly over-represents  the seriousness  of a  defendant's\r\n\ncriminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit\r\n\nfurther crimes.\"   \r\n\n          Generally,  an  appellate court  lacks  jurisdiction to\r\n\nreview  a sentencing court's discretionary decision not to depart\r\n\nbelow the guideline sentencing  range.  United States v.  Pierro,\r                                                                          \r\n\n32  F.3d 611,  619 (1st  Cir 1994),  cert. denied,  513 U.S.  111\r                                                           \r\n\n(1995).   An  exception to  this  general rule  applies when  the\r\n\nsentencing  court's decision  not  to depart  is  based upon  its\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nbelief that  it lacks  the authority  or power to  depart.

Mangos  made   the\r\n\noverrepresentation  argument to the district court.  The district\r\n\ncourt expressed that it had  taken into account the arguments for\r\n\na downward  departure but  concluded that  the assigned  criminal\r\n\nhistory  category  \"adequately   and  appropriately\"  represented\r\n\nMangos's  extensive criminal history.   Thus, the  district court\r\n\nrecognized its  authority to depart  downward on this  ground and\r\n\nexercised its discretion in declining to do so.  Consequently, we\r\n\nlack jurisdiction to review its determination.  \r\n\n                               IV.\r                                         IV.\r\n\n          Finally, Mangos maintains that the district court erred\r\n\nin failing  to grant  a downward adjustment  for his role  in the\r\n\noffense  of transferring a firearm.  Specifically, Mangos asserts\r\n\nthat the  district court should  have considered his role  in the\r\n\ncontext  of the overall  criminal activity including  the robbery\r\n\nand not just in the  context of the transfer of the firearm.   He\r\n\nfurther argues that, even  in the context of the  transfer of the\r\n\nfirearm, he was still less culpable than other participants.\r\n\n          Under the Sentencing  Guidelines, a defendant's offense\r\n\nlevel may be adjusted downward if the defendant was substantially\r\n\nless culpable than  other participants  in the  crime.   U.S.S.G.\r\n\n  3B1.2  (1995).   The burden,  however, is  on the  defendant to\r\n\nestablish that a downward adjustment is warranted.  United States\r                                                                           \r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nv.

In  addition,  because  role-in-the-offense\r\n\ndeterminations  are fact-bound,  we review  them  only for  clear\r\n\nerror.   United States  v. Jackson,  3 F.3d  506,  508 (1st  Cir.\r                                            \r\n\n1993).\r\n\n          The   district  court   considered  sentencing   Mangos\r\n\naccording  to the guidelines  for robbery, U.S.S.G.    2B3.1, but\r\n\nultimately  sentenced Mangos  according  to  the  guidelines  for\r\n\nprohibited   transactions  involving   firearms  or   ammunition,\r\n\nU.S.S.G.   2K2.1.   Mangos was therefore not  convicted of either\r\n\nthe robbery  or the  attack on Jennifer  Hanscomb, and  the court\r\n\nheld that he  was not substantially less culpable  than the other\r\n\nparticipants for his convicted offense of illegally  transferring\r\n\na firearm.   At  sentencing, the district  court assumed  for the\r\n\npurposes   of  sentencing  that  Sam  Gaiewski  was  involved  in\r\n\ntransferring the  firearm and  may have been  the individual  who\r\n\nactually  removed  the  firearm  from  Mangos'  apartment.    The\r\n\ndistrict  court,  nevertheless,  found  that   Mangos  owned  the\r\n\nfirearm, knew of  its intended use, and  authorized its transfer.\r\n\nThe district court held  that, as a result, a  role reduction was\r\n\nnot appropriate.  The district court  did not clearly err in this\r\n\ndetermination.  \r\n\n          We affirm the sentence imposed by the district court.\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n",

GIBSON, Senior Circuit Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vinson Mangos appeals from a sentence imposed upon him following his guilty plea to transferring a firearm knowing that it would be used to commit a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(h) (1994).  He contends that the district court erred in imposing an eighty-eight month sentence.  He argues that:  (1) his earlier assault conviction in a Massachusetts court was not a crime of violence under the sentencing guidelines;  (2) the district court misinterpreted the guidelines in its treatment of this issue;  (3) the district court erred as a matter of law in not departing downward because of the overcounting of prior offenses;  and (4) in not granting him a role reduction because he was the least culpable of the various participants.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The primary issues in this appeal are the attacks upon the sentence, and thus an abbreviated outline of the events giving rise to his guilty plea suffices.  Mangos and three others, Gordon Higgins, Cathy Tremblay, and Luis Morey, attempted to rob John Collins, whom they believed was selling crack cocaine from his trailer.  In doing so, Mangos carried his 20-gauge shotgun with a pistol grip when he, Higgins, and Morey entered Collins's trailer.  This robbery attempt was aborted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Four days later Mangos declined to join Higgins, Tremblay, and Morey in a second effort to rob Collins, but allowed Higgins to use his shotgun, knowing that Higgins planned to use it in the robbery.  Collins fled through a window but the robbers injured Collins's girlfriend, Jennifer Hanscomb.  The robbers found no drugs and left the trailer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mangos was charged with a drug conspiracy count and a count for the use of a firearm in a drug trafficking crime.  These charges were dismissed when Mangos pleaded guilty to transferring a firearm knowing it would be used to commit a drug trafficking crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sentencing Mangos, the district court assessed two points for a 1992 Massachusetts conviction for larceny, one point for a 1992 assault and battery under Massachusetts law, and yet another point for a 1992 Massachusetts conviction for possession of crack cocaine.  A 1994 Maine conviction for assault resulted in two points, and a 1994 guilty plea to a separate assault charge in Maine resulted in one point.  After failing to pay fines for operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol in 1994, Mangos was sentenced to incarceration in lieu of the fines, which resulted in two additional criminal history points.  The subtotal of the criminal history score was nine, but two points were added because Mangos committed the offense of conviction less than two years after he was released from custody for violating his probation on the assault charge.  He thus had eleven criminal history points, which gave him a criminal category of V.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court placed the base offense level at 24.  The district court added four levels, producing an adjusted offense level of 28, because Mangos transferred the firearm with the knowledge and intent that it would be used in connection with another felony offense.  With a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, the total offense level was 25 with a criminal history category of V. The government made a section 5K1.1 motion, and the district court departed downward by twelve months to reach the sentence of eighty-eight months imprisonment, to be followed by three years of supervised release and a $100 special assessment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mangos argues that the district court erred in characterizing his earlier assault and battery of Manuel Herrera in Massachusetts as a \"crime of violence\" for the purposes of sentencing.  Mangos contends that the description in the charging instrument that he \"did assault and beat\" Herrera is boilerplate language and as such does not sufficiently distinguish whether the assault and battery involved violence or merely nonconsensual offensive touching.  The government responds that the language \"assault and beat\" indicates that the crime involved violence or threatened violence, and, in any event, created a serious risk of potential injury to another.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual section 2K2.1, a defendant convicted of illegally transferring a firearm is assigned a base offense level of 24 if the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense, as opposed to a base offense level of 22 if the defendant has only one such prior offense.  The district court determined that Mangos's prior convictions for the assault and battery of Herrera and the assault and battery of Evagelio Rodrguez qualified Mangos for the higher base offense level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether the assault and battery of Herrera was a \"crime of violence\" under the Sentencing Guidelines is a question of law, which we review de novo.  See United States v. Fernandez, 121 F.3d 777, 778 (1st Cir.1997).   The term \"crime of violence\" is defined in the Sentencing Guidelines as any offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or (ii) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion ... or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2.  In determining whether a prior offense meets this definition, we take a formal categorical approach, looking to the statutory formulation of the crime charged rather than to the facts behind the actual conviction.  See United States v. Damon, 127 F.3d 139, 142 (1st Cir.1997);  United States v. De Jesus, 984 F.2d 21, 23 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts statutory law makes assault and battery a criminal offense punishable by up to two and one-half years imprisonment, but does not define assault and battery.  See Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 265, &#167; 13A (1996).  We look to Massachusetts common law for the meaning of \"assault and battery.\"   In Commonwealth v. Burke, 390 Mass. 480, 457 N.E.2d 622 (1983), the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts defined assault as an \"offer or attempt to do a battery\" and stated that every battery includes an assault.  Id. 457 N.E.2d at 624 (citations omitted.).  The court in Burke then stated that the law of battery is bifurcated into harmful batteries and offensive batteries.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject Mangos's contention that because assault and battery includes offensive but nonharmful conduct, it should not be considered a crime of violence.  Under the Sentencing Guidelines, the term \"crime of violence\" is not limited to those crimes for which violence is a necessary element, but instead extends to any crime which \"otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2(1)(ii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Fernandez, this court determined that the Massachusetts crime of assault and battery upon a police officer was properly classified as a crime of violence under the sentencing guidelines.  121 F.3d at 780.   We reasoned, \"While it is true that neither violence, nor the use of force, is an essential element of the crime as statutorily defined, still, violence, the use of force, and a serious risk of physical harm are all likely to accompany an assault and battery upon a police officer.\"  Id. While we recognize that the risks inherent in the assault and battery upon a police officer may differ from those involved in a simple assault and battery, we believe that the reasoning in Fernandez applies with similar force to this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the state criminal statute involves different types of offenses, some arguably violent and some not, we look first to the charging document to see which type of offense is involved.  See Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2160, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990);  Damon, 127 F.3d at 142-143.   Here, the charging document states that Mangos \"did assault and beat\" Manuel Herrera.  The district court, following United States v. Harris, 964 F.2d 1234 (1st Cir.1992), found that this statement that the assault amounted to a beating of Herrera qualified the crime charged as a violent and felony offense.  This places Mangos's offense into the harmful battery type, and thus meets the definition of a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2.  There is nothing in the record or the charging document that refers to an offensive touching or a touching without consent, such as described in Burke.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mangos additionally argues that the district court erred in counting Mangos's conviction for the assault and battery of Herrera and his conviction for the assault and battery of Rodrguez as separate prior felony convictions and therefore sentencing Mangos to a base offense level of 24.  Mangos asserts that the sentences for these offenses were related because they were consolidated for sentencing.  He contends that because the sentences were related, the offenses should be treated as a single prior felony conviction under section 2K2.1.  This argument, however, is based upon a misreading of the guidelines.  Mangos cites section 4A1.2(a)(2), which states, \"Prior sentences imposed in related cases are to be treated as one sentence for purposes of &#167; 4A1.1(a), (b), and (c).\"   By its own terms, this provision does not govern the treatment of \"prior felony convictions\" under section 2K2.1.  As a result, we conclude that Mangos's argument regarding related sentences is without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mangos contends that the district court erred in including his conviction in a Maine state court for assaulting his sister as part of his criminal history for the purposes of sentencing.  Mangos claims that the conviction was not counseled and is not a reliable indicator that he actually committed the assault.  The government responds that the Maine conviction was counseled and that no basis exists for rejecting that conviction as unreliable.  Because the parties dispute whether the Maine conviction was counseled, the questions we must address are questions of fact.  Therefore, we review only for clear error.  See United States v. Goldberg, 105 F.3d 770, 777 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 1, 1993, the State of Maine arrested Mangos for assaulting his sister, Roxanna Mangos.  In March 1994, the state moved to have the charge \"filed\" with no costs.  Later that year, however, the charge was brought forward again when Mango was also charged with operating a vehicle while under the influence and operating after suspension. Mangos pleaded guilty to all of the charges.  Mangos was sentenced to ten days for the assault, to be served concurrently with a seven day sentence imposed for the offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The current dispute arises from the form of representation Mangos was assigned on the day he plead guilty to the above charges.  At the time Mangos was arraigned, the state court had a pilot program known as \"lawyer for a day.\"   The purpose of the program was to facilitate early resolutions of cases by allowing people who were considering entering guilty pleas to consult with an attorney.  Typically, the lawyer for the day, usually an experienced criminal defense attorney, would be assigned to about fifteen defendants.  The lawyer would meet with the defendants for anywhere from five minutes to a half hour.  During that time, the lawyer would review any available paperwork, discuss apparent defenses, and negotiate with the district attorney.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mangos appears to argue that this form of representation was too limited to be considered legal counseling.  We are not persuaded.  Mangos was assigned an experienced criminal defense attorney charged with the professional duty of zealous advocacy.  Mangos's lawyer appears to have had discretion both in how long to consult with Mangos and in what courses of action to advise.  Nothing indicates that Mangos's attorney was in any way prohibited from advising against a guilty plea or suggesting that Mangos seek further counsel.  In light of these facts, it is clear that Mangos's claim that he was not counseled is, in actuality, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.  A sentencing court is an inappropriate forum for ineffective assistance of counsel claims addressed to prior convictions.  See Custis v. United States, 511 U.S. 485, 496, 114 S.Ct. 1732, 1738-39, 128 L.Ed.2d 517 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also conclude that the Maine conviction was a reliable indicator that Mangos committed the charged offense.  Mangos pleaded guilty to assaulting his sister and was sentenced to ten days in prison.  We refuse to probe Mangos's possible motives for entering that plea, and accept the guilty plea as an admission of guilt.  We hold that the district court did not clearly err in including the Maine conviction as part of Mangos's criminal history.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mangos argues that the district court erred in failing to grant an additional downward departure (beyond the section 5K1.1 downward departure) under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3 (Policy Statement).  Section 4A1.3 provides, in part, that a sentencing court may depart from the applicable guideline range when \"the court concludes that a defendant's criminal history category significantly over-represents the seriousness of a defendant's criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit further crimes.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally, an appellate court lacks jurisdiction to review a sentencing court's discretionary decision not to depart below the guideline sentencing range.  United States v. Pierro, 32 F.3d 611, 619 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1119, 115 S.Ct. 919, 130 L.Ed.2d 799 (1995).   An exception to this general rule applies when the sentencing court's decision not to depart is based upon its belief that it lacks the authority or power to depart.  Id.; United States v. Morrison, 46 F.3d 127, 130 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing the record, we do not believe the exception is applicable in this case.  Mangos made the overrepresentation argument to the district court.  The district court expressed that it had taken into account the arguments for a downward departure but concluded that the assigned criminal history category \"adequately and appropriately\" represented Mangos's extensive criminal history.  Thus, the district court recognized its authority to depart downward on this ground and exercised its discretion in declining to do so.  Consequently, we lack jurisdiction to review its determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Mangos maintains that the district court erred in failing to grant a downward adjustment for his role in the offense of transferring a firearm.  Specifically, Mangos asserts that the district court should have considered his role in the context of the overall criminal activity including the robbery and not just in the context of the transfer of the firearm.

Mangos was therefore not convicted of either the robbery or the attack on Jennifer Hanscomb, and the court held that he was not substantially less culpable than the other participants for his convicted offense of illegally transferring a firearm.  At sentencing, the district court assumed for the purposes of sentencing that Sam Gaiewski was involved in transferring the firearm and may have been the individual who actually removed the firearm from Mangos' apartment.

He contends that the district court erred in imposing an eighty-eight month sentence.  He argues that:  (1) his earlier assault conviction in a Massachusetts court was not a crime of violence under the sentencing guidelines;  (2) the district court misinterpreted the guidelines in its treatment of this issue;  (3) the district court erred as a matter of law in not departing downward because of the overcounting of prior offenses;  and (4) in not granting him a role reduction because he was the least culpable of the various participants.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The primary issues in this appeal are the attacks upon the sentence, and thus an abbreviated outline of the events giving rise to his guilty plea suffices.  Mangos and three others, Gordon Higgins, Cathy Tremblay, and Luis Morey, attempted to rob John Collins, whom they believed was selling crack cocaine from his trailer.  In doing so, Mangos carried his 20-gauge shotgun with a pistol grip when he, Higgins, and Morey entered Collins's trailer.  This robbery attempt was aborted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Four days later Mangos declined to join Higgins, Tremblay, and Morey in a second effort to rob Collins, but allowed Higgins to use his shotgun, knowing that Higgins planned to use it in the robbery.  Collins fled through a window but the robbers injured Collins's girlfriend, Jennifer Hanscomb.  The robbers found no drugs and left the trailer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mangos was charged with a drug conspiracy count and a count for the use of a firearm in a drug trafficking crime.  These charges were dismissed when Mangos pleaded guilty to transferring a firearm knowing it would be used to commit a drug trafficking crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sentencing Mangos, the district court assessed two points for a 1992 Massachusetts conviction for larceny, one point for a 1992 assault and battery under Massachusetts law, and yet another point for a 1992 Massachusetts conviction for possession of crack cocaine.  A 1994 Maine conviction for assault resulted in two points, and a 1994 guilty plea to a separate assault charge in Maine resulted in one point.  After failing to pay fines for operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol in 1994, Mangos was sentenced to incarceration in lieu of the fines, which resulted in two additional criminal history points.  The subtotal of the criminal history score was nine, but two points were added because Mangos committed the offense of conviction less than two years after he was released from custody for violating his probation on the assault charge.  He thus had eleven criminal history points, which gave him a criminal category of V.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court placed the base offense level at 24.  The district court added four levels, producing an adjusted offense level of 28, because Mangos transferred the firearm with the knowledge and intent that it would be used in connection with another felony offense.  With a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, the total offense level was 25 with a criminal history category of V. The government made a section 5K1.1 motion, and the district court departed downward by twelve months to reach the sentence of eighty-eight months imprisonment, to be followed by three years of supervised release and a $100 special assessment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mangos argues that the district court erred in characterizing his earlier assault and battery of Manuel Herrera in Massachusetts as a \"crime of violence\" for the purposes of sentencing.  Mangos contends that the description in the charging instrument that he \"did assault and beat\" Herrera is boilerplate language and as such does not sufficiently distinguish whether the assault and battery involved violence or merely nonconsensual offensive touching.  The government responds that the language \"assault and beat\" indicates that the crime involved violence or threatened violence, and, in any event, created a serious risk of potential injury to another.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual section 2K2.1, a defendant convicted of illegally transferring a firearm is assigned a base offense level of 24 if the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense, as opposed to a base offense level of 22 if the defendant has only one such prior offense.  The district court determined that Mangos's prior convictions for the assault and battery of Herrera and the assault and battery of Evagelio Rodrguez qualified Mangos for the higher base offense level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether the assault and battery of Herrera was a \"crime of violence\" under the Sentencing Guidelines is a question of law, which we review de novo.  See United States v. Fernandez, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">777</span></span>, 778 (1st Cir.1997).   The term \"crime of violence\" is defined in the Sentencing Guidelines as any offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or (ii) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion ... or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2.  In determining whether a prior offense meets this definition, we take a formal categorical approach, looking to the statutory formulation of the crime charged rather than to the facts behind the actual conviction.  See United States v. Damon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197584\"><a href=\"/opinion/197584/united-states-v-damon/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span>, 142 (1st Cir.1997);  United States v.

See Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 265, &#167; 13A (1996).  We look to Massachusetts common law for the meaning of \"assault and battery.\"   In Commonwealth v. Burke, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2076621\"><a href=\"/opinion/2076621/commonwealth-v-burke/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2076621\"><a href=\"/opinion/2076621/commonwealth-v-burke/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">622</span></a></span> (1983), the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts defined assault as an \"offer or attempt to do a battery\" and stated that every battery includes an assault.  Id. 457 N.E.2d at 624 (citations omitted.).  The court in Burke then stated that the law of battery is bifurcated into harmful batteries and offensive batteries.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject Mangos's contention that because assault and battery includes offensive but nonharmful conduct, it should not be considered a crime of violence.  Under the Sentencing Guidelines, the term \"crime of violence\" is not limited to those crimes for which violence is a necessary element, but instead extends to any crime which \"otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2(1)(ii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Fernandez, this court determined that the Massachusetts crime of assault and battery upon a police officer was properly classified as a crime of violence under the sentencing guidelines.  121 F.3d at 780.   We reasoned, \"While it is true that neither violence, nor the use of force, is an essential element of the crime as statutorily defined, still, violence, the use of force, and a serious risk of physical harm are all likely to accompany an assault and battery upon a police officer.\"  Id. While we recognize that the risks inherent in the assault and battery upon a police officer may differ from those involved in a simple assault and battery, we believe that the reasoning in Fernandez applies with similar force to this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the state criminal statute involves different types of offenses, some arguably violent and some not, we look first to the charging document to see which type of offense is involved.  See Taylor v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112435\"><a href=\"/opinion/112435/taylor-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span>, 602, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112435\"><a href=\"/opinion/112435/taylor-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></a></span> (1990);  Damon, 127 F.3d at 142-143.   Here, the charging document states that Mangos \"did assault and beat\" Manuel Herrera.  The district court, following United States v. Harris, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583860\"><a href=\"/opinion/583860/united-states-v-gerald-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">964</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1234</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1992), found that this statement that the assault amounted to a beating of Herrera qualified the crime charged as a violent and felony offense.  This places Mangos's offense into the harmful battery type, and thus meets the definition of a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2.  There is nothing in the record or the charging document that refers to an offensive touching or a touching without consent, such as described in Burke.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mangos additionally argues that the district court erred in counting Mangos's conviction for the assault and battery of Herrera and his conviction for the assault and battery of Rodrguez as separate prior felony convictions and therefore sentencing Mangos to a base offense level of 24.  Mangos asserts that the sentences for these offenses were related because they were consolidated for sentencing.  He contends that because the sentences were related, the offenses should be treated as a single prior felony conviction under section 2K2.1.  This argument, however, is based upon a misreading of the guidelines.  Mangos cites section 4A1.2(a)(2), which states, \"Prior sentences imposed in related cases are to be treated as one sentence for purposes of &#167; 4A1.1(a), (b), and (c).\"   By its own terms, this provision does not govern the treatment of \"prior felony convictions\" under section 2K2.1.  As a result, we conclude that Mangos's argument regarding related sentences is without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mangos contends that the district court erred in including his conviction in a Maine state court for assaulting his sister as part of his criminal history for the purposes of sentencing.  Mangos claims that the conviction was not counseled and is not a reliable indicator that he actually committed the assault.  The government responds that the Maine conviction was counseled and that no basis exists for rejecting that conviction as unreliable.  Because the parties dispute whether the Maine conviction was counseled, the questions we must address are questions of fact.  Therefore, we review only for clear error.  See United States v. Goldberg, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"734112\"><a href=\"/opinion/734112/united-states-v-richard-goldberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">770</span></a></span>, 777 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 1, 1993, the State of Maine arrested Mangos for assaulting his sister, Roxanna Mangos.  In March 1994, the state moved to have the charge \"filed\" with no costs.  Later that year, however, the charge was brought forward again when Mango was also charged with operating a vehicle while under the influence and operating after suspension. Mangos pleaded guilty to all of the charges.  Mangos was sentenced to ten days for the assault, to be served concurrently with a seven day sentence imposed for the offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The current dispute arises from the form of representation Mangos was assigned on the day he plead guilty to the above charges.  At the time Mangos was arraigned, the state court had a pilot program known as \"lawyer for a day.\"   The purpose of the program was to facilitate early resolutions of cases by allowing people who were considering entering guilty pleas to consult with an attorney.  Typically, the lawyer for the day, usually an experienced criminal defense attorney, would be assigned to about fifteen defendants.  The lawyer would meet with the defendants for anywhere from five minutes to a half hour.  During that time, the lawyer would review any available paperwork, discuss apparent defenses, and negotiate with the district attorney.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mangos appears to argue that this form of representation was too limited to be considered legal counseling.  We are not persuaded.  Mangos was assigned an experienced criminal defense attorney charged with the professional duty of zealous advocacy.  Mangos's lawyer appears to have had discretion both in how long to consult with Mangos and in what courses of action to advise.  Nothing indicates that Mangos's attorney was in any way prohibited from advising against a guilty plea or suggesting that Mangos seek further counsel.  In light of these facts, it is clear that Mangos's claim that he was not counseled is, in actuality, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.  A sentencing court is an inappropriate forum for ineffective assistance of counsel claims addressed to prior convictions.  See Custis v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087955\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087955/custis-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">485</span></a></span>, 496, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087955\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087955/custis-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Mangos pleaded guilty to assaulting his sister and was sentenced to ten days in prison.  We refuse to probe Mangos's possible motives for entering that plea, and accept the guilty plea as an admission of guilt.  We hold that the district court did not clearly err in including the Maine conviction as part of Mangos's criminal history.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mangos argues that the district court erred in failing to grant an additional downward departure (beyond the section 5K1.1 downward departure) under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3 (Policy Statement).  Section 4A1.3 provides, in part, that a sentencing court may depart from the applicable guideline range when \"the court concludes that a defendant's criminal history category significantly over-represents the seriousness of a defendant's criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit further crimes.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally, an appellate court lacks jurisdiction to review a sentencing court's discretionary decision not to depart below the guideline sentencing range.  United States v. Pierro, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195522\"><a href=\"/opinion/195522/united-states-v-pierro/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">611</span></a></span>, 619 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1119</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">799</span></span> (1995).   An exception to this general rule applies when the sentencing court's decision not to depart is based upon its belief that it lacks the authority or power to depart.  Id.; United States v. Morrison, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195889\"><a href=\"/opinion/195889/united-states-v-morrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">127</span></a></span>, 130 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing the record, we do not believe the exception is applicable in this case.  Mangos made the overrepresentation argument to the district court.  The district court expressed that it had taken into account the arguments for a downward departure but concluded that the assigned criminal history category \"adequately and appropriately\" represented Mangos's extensive criminal history.  Thus, the district court recognized its authority to depart downward on this ground and exercised its discretion in declining to do so.  Consequently, we lack jurisdiction to review its determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Mangos maintains that the district court erred in failing to grant a downward adjustment for his role in the offense of transferring a firearm.  Specifically, Mangos asserts that the district court should have considered his role in the context of the overall criminal activity including the robbery and not just in the context of the transfer of the firearm.  He further argues that, even in the context of the transfer of the firearm, he was still less culpable than other participants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Sentencing Guidelines, a defendant's offense level may be adjusted downward if the defendant was substantially less culpable than other participants in the crime.  U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.2 (1995).  The burden, however, is on the defendant to establish that a downward adjustment is warranted.  United States v. Ortiz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584511\"><a href=\"/opinion/584511/united-states-v-ruben-ortiz-aka-ruben-ortiz-de-jesus-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">966</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">707</span></a></span>, 717 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1063</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Mangos was therefore not convicted of either the robbery or the attack on Jennifer Hanscomb, and the court held that he was not substantially less culpable than the other participants for his convicted offense of illegally transferring a firearm.  At sentencing, the district court assumed for the purposes of sentencing that Sam Gaiewski was involved in transferring the firearm and may have been the individual who actually removed the firearm from Mangos' apartment.  The district court, nevertheless, found that Mangos owned the firearm, knew of its intended use, and authorized its transfer.  The district court held that, as a result, a role reduction was not appropriate.
