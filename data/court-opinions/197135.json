Plaintiff James  Murray appeals  from\r                      PER CURIAM\r\n\nthe entry of summary judgment on his employment-related claim\r\n\nagainst  the City of Boston.  Murray, a former city employee,\r\n\nbrought claims against  the City of  Boston and Mayor  Menino\r\n\nunder  42 U.S.C.    1983 and  the Massachusetts  Civil Rights\r\n\nAct, Mass. Gen. L. ch. 12,   11I (\"MCRA\").\r\n\n          Murray  alleges that,  in 1992,  he was  terminated\r\n\nfrom his position as  Executive Assistant to the Commissioner\r\n\nfor Elderly Affairs, and that, in 1994, he was constructively\r\n\nterminated  from his  subsequent position  as a  reporter for\r\n\nBoston   Seniority,   a   Commission   for   Elderly  Affairs\r                              \r\n\npublication.   Murray  resigned from  the latter  position in\r\n\nMarch 1994.    Murray alleges  that these employment  actions\r\n\nwere   punishment  for  expressing   his  political  beliefs,\r\n\nspecifically for  running for City  Council in  1991 and  for\r\n\nMayor in 1993 against the incumbent Mayor of Boston.\r\n\n          The district court granted summary judgment for the\r\n\ndefendants  on all  claims.   Murray  appeals  only from  the\r\n\njudgment against him as  to the City.  Because Murray has not\r\n\nadduced evidence sufficient to establish  municipal liability\r\n\nunder   1983, we affirm the district court's grant of summary\r\n\njudgment on that  claim.1  As Murray has failed  to show that\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Defendant also  argues that Murray was not constructively\r\nterminated  and that,  on the  merits, he  has not  shown any\r\nretaliation, much  less for  the expression of  his political\r\nviews.  We find  it unnecessary to reach these  arguments but\r\nnote that they appear well taken.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nhe was subject to  any threats, intimidation, or  coercion, a\r\n\nnecessary  element of claims  under the MCRA,  we also affirm\r\n\nthe grant of summary judgment on the state law claim.\r\n\n          In order to make out a claim of municipal liability\r\n\nunder    1983, Murray  must  show that  the  \"execution of  a\r\n\ngovernment's policy  or custom, whether made  by lawmakers or\r\n\nby those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent\r\n\nofficial  policy, inflicts the  injury.\"  Monell  v. New York\r                                                                         \r\n\nDep't of Social Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 694 (1978).  The theory\r                                  \r\n\nof respondeat superior has  no place in such claims.   Id. at\r                                                                      \r\n\n691.  The \"custom\" on which liability is premised must be \"so\r\n\npermanent  and well  settled as  to constitute  a 'custom  or\r\n\nusage' with the force  of law.\" Id. (quoting Adickes  v. S.H.\r                                                                         \r\n\nKress  Co., 398  U.S. 144,  167-68 (1970)(internal  quotation\r                      \r\n\nmarks omitted)).   Murray does  not contend that  there is  a\r\n\nformal  act or  written policy  which embodies  the so-called\r\n\npolicy of retaliation.   Nor does he contend that  \"anyone in\r\n\ncity government ever promulgated, or even articulated, such a\r\n\npolicy.\"  City of  St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U.S. 112, 128\r                                                      \r\n\n(1988).  Rather, he says that there is  an informal policy or\r\n\ncustom  of punishing  city  employees  who express  political\r\n\nviews different than those of the administration.\r\n\n          This  court   had   said  that   there   are   \"two\r\n\nrequirements for  plaintiffs to meet in  maintaining a   1983\r\n\naction grounded upon an unconstitutional municipal custom\":\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n               First,  the  custom or  practice  must be\r\n               attributable  to  the  municipality. .  .\r\n               .[I]t   must   be  so   well-settled  and\r\n               widespread    that    the    policymaking\r\n               officials of the municipality can be said\r\n               to  have  either  actual or  constructive\r\n               knowledge  of it  yet did nothing  to end\r\n               the  practice.   Second, the  custom must\r\n               have  been the  cause of  and  the moving\r\n               force    behind   the    deprivation   of\r\n               constitutional rights.\r\n\nBordanaro v. McLeod, 871  F.2d 1151, 1156 (1st Cir.)(internal\r                               \r\n\ncitations omitted), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 820 (1989).\r                                            \r\n\n          On the first point,  Murray naturally relies on his\r\n\nown employment history, which  need not be detailed  here, to\r\n\nsupport  his   claim  that  there  is   a  \"well-settled  and\r\n\nwidespread\" custom.   But evidence of a  single occurrence is\r\n\nusually  insufficient,  in  and  of itself,  to  establish  a\r\n\nmunicipal  \"custom  and  usage.\"   St.  Hilaire  v.  City  of\r                                                                         \r\n\nLaconia, 71 F.3d 20, 29 (1st Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 116 S.\r                                                                 \r\n\nCt.  2548   (1996);  Mahan   v.  Plymouth  County   House  of\r                                                                         \r\n\nCorrections, 64 F.3d 14, 16-17 (1st Cir. 1995). \r                       \r\n\n          Murray tries  to buttress his claim that there is a\r\n\n\"custom\" by pointing  to three lawsuits  filed in the  United\r\n\nStates District  Court for the District  of Massachusetts and\r\n\none  complaint  filed  before  the  Massachusetts  Commission\r\n\nAgainst Discrimination by present or  former city employees.2\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  We   assume  arguendo  that  the  deposition  transcripts\r                                     \r\nproffered  by Murray  constitute admissible  evidence.    The\r\nCity  argues that they are inadmissible hearsay.  See Garside\r                                                                         \r\nv. Osco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46 (1st Cir. 1990).\r                              \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nThere is  considerable doubt that three  individual law suits\r\n\nand   one  administrative  complaint,   even  if   each  made\r\n\nallegations comparable  to Murray's, would suffice  to show a\r\n\ncustom with  the force of law.   But these other disputes are\r\n\nnot  comparable to  the  present action  and  do not  involve\r\n\nsimilar  allegations  of  retaliation  because  of  political\r\n\nopposition  to the  incumbent  administration.   None of  the\r\n\ncomplaining individuals was,  from the evidence presented,  a\r\n\ncandidate  for office.  Even if Murray's complaint is read to\r\n\nallege  a broader  theory  of retaliation,  encompassing more\r\n\nthan  just retaliation  against  city employees  who run  for\r\n\noffice  against incumbent  city  officials,  the  other  fact\r\n\nsettings he proffers do  not support his claim that  there is\r\n\nsuch a custom or policy.\r\n\n          These  claims involve  diverse  city agencies,  and\r\n\ndifferent city officials were responsible for  the employment\r\n\nactions at issue.  One  claimant makes allegations of  denial\r\n\nof due process  in how  his job was  terminated, one  alleges\r\n\ntermination following  her criticism of her employing agency,\r\n\none alleges  sexual harassment,  and one  alleges retaliation\r\n\nfor speaking out against sexual  harassment.  Murray makes no\r\n\nattempt   to  link   these  various   claims  to   a  central\r\n\npolicymaker.  These disparate facts  do not fall easily under\r\n\neven the  broader category of  a \"custom\"  of punishing  city\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nemployees  for expression,  in any  form, of  political views\r\n\ncontrary to those of the city administration.  \r\n\n          Such a protean view as that offered by Murray would\r\n\nrender the  \"custom\" requirement  meaningless.   In  contrast\r\n\nwith the  showing made here,  this court has  credited proof,\r\n\nsuch as that offered in Bordanaro, of uncontroverted evidence\r                                             \r\n\nfrom witnesses  with first  hand knowledge  of a practice  of\r\n\nparticular  city  officials who  repeatedly  engaged,  over a\r\n\nperiod of  time, in exactly the same sort of unconstitutional\r\n\nbehavior.   See Bordanaro, 871 F.2d  at 1156.

The Supreme Judicial Court has said that:\r\n\n          \"[t]hreat\" in this  context involves  the\r\n          intentional exertion of pressure  to make\r\n          another fearful or apprehensive of injury\r\n          or harm.  \"Intimidation\" involves putting\r\n          in fear for the  purpose of compelling or\r\n          deterring  conduct. . .  .

Murray presents no evidence from which a\r\n\ncourt  could  conclude that  he  was  subjected to  \"threats,\r\n\nintimidation, or  coercion\" of  this nature.   Therefore, his\r\n\nstate law claim fails on the merits as well.\r\n\n          The judgment of the district court granting summary\r\n\njudgment to the defendant on all claims is affirmed.\r                                                               \r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n",

Murray, a former city employee, brought claims against the City of Boston and Mayor Menino under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 12, &#167; 11I (\"MCRA\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Murray alleges that, in 1992, he was terminated from his position as Executive Assistant to the Commissioner for Elderly Affairs, and that, in 1994, he was constructively terminated from his subsequent position as a reporter for Boston Seniority, a Commission for Elderly Affairs publication.  Murray resigned from the latter position in March 1994.  Murray alleges that these employment actions were punishment for expressing his political beliefs, specifically for running for City Council in 1991 and for Mayor in 1993 against the incumbent Mayor of Boston.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants on all claims.  Murray appeals only from the judgment against him as to the City.  Because Murray has not adduced evidence sufficient to establish municipal liability under &#167; 1983, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment on that claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  As Murray has failed to show that he was subject to any threats, intimidation, or coercion, a necessary element of claims under the MCRA, we also affirm the grant of summary judgment on the state law claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to make out a claim of municipal liability under &#167; 1983, Murray must show that the \"execution of a government's policy or custom, whether made by lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy, inflicts the injury.\"  Monell v.
