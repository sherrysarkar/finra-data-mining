Under  the legal  certainty\r                            \r\n\ntest, plaintiffs must establish \"that it does not appear to a\r                                                             \r\n\nlegal certainty  that the  claim is below  the jurisdictional\r                                                     \r\n\nminimum.\" Id.,  102.106[1].\r                         \r\n\n          We assume  for purposes  of this appeal  that these\r\n\nplaintiffs'  claims  cannot  be  aggregated  for purposes  of\r\n\ncalculating  the requisite  jurisdictional  amount.   See  15\r                                                                     \r\n\nMoore's Federal  Practice, supra,   102.108[3][b].

Pain and suffering damages are recognized under\r\n\nPuerto  Rico tort and contract law.  See Serrano v.

Puerto Rico, 1994).\r                          \r\n\nWe   conclude  that   each  plaintiff   met  his   burden  of\r\n\ndemonstrating  that it does  not appear to  a legal certainty\r\n\nthat his claim is below $50,000.\r\n\n          II.  Judgment as  a Matter of Law  and Failure\r                                                                    \r\n     to        State a Claim\r                                        \r\n\n          Appellant argues  that the district  court erred in\r\n\ndenying  her motion  pursuant  to Fed.  R.  Civ. P.  50,  for\r\n\njudgment  as a  matter  of law  where  \"there is  no  legally\r\n\nsufficient evidentiary  basis for  a reasonable jury  to find\r\n\nfor that  party on that issue.\"  In reviewing the denial of a\r\n\nmotion for judgment as a matter of law,  we review the record\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nto  determine  whether it  \"provides an  adequate evidentiary\r\n\nbasis  for the district court's decision to submit the matter\r\n\nto the jury.\"  Santiago Hodge v. Parke Davis &amp;  Co., 909 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n628,  634 (1st  Cir. 1990).   Without the  trial transcripts,\r\n\nwhich appellant has not provided, this court cannot make that\r\n\ndetermination.    Therefore,  appellant is  not  entitled  to\r\n\nrelief on the ground that the district court erred in denying\r\n\nher motion for  judgment as  a matter of  law.1  See  Valedon\r                                                          1              \r\n\nMartinez v. Hospital Presbiteriano de la Comunidad, Inc., 806\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 1128, 1135 (1st Cir. 1986) (this court will not review a\r\n\nclaim   of  error  if  appellant  has  failed  to  include  a\r\n\ntranscript  of the  pertinent  proceedings in  the record  on\r\n\nappeal).\r\n\n          Appellant argued  in her motion to  dismiss, as she\r\n\ndoes  on appeal, that the  complaint failed to  state a claim\r\n\nagainst her for fraud or breach of contract.  She argued that\r\n\nshe  was not  a  party  to  the  contracts  between  MHC  and\r\n\nplaintiffs  and,  therefore, was  not  liable  thereon.   She\r\n\nfurther  contended   that  \"in  the  absence  of  contractual\r\n\nobligation  a  party cannot  be  charged  with  fraud.\"   The\r\n\nelements  of a  fraud claim  under Puerto Rico  law are  1) a\r\n\nfalse   representation   by  defendant,   (2)the  plaintiff's\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1  Similarly, Rivera's claim that, as a matter of law, co-\r               1\r\nplaintiff Carlos  Fernandez \"did not  have a cause  of action\r\nagainst  Delia Rivera  based  on his  testimony [at  trial],\"\r\ncannot be reviewed without the trial transcripts.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nreasonable   and  foreseeable  reliance  thereon,  injury  to\r\n\nplaintiff from  his reliance,  and (4) intent  to defraud  by\r\n\nplaintiff.  See Wadsworth, Inc.  v. Schwarz-Nin, 951 F. Supp.\r                                                           \r\n\n314, 323  (D. Puerto Rico 1996).   The complaint sufficiently\r\n\nalleged each of the required elements.\r\n\n          III.  Attachment\r                                      \r\n\n          We affirm  the district court's order  dated August\r\n\n1, 1995 essentially for  the reasons stated therein.   We add\r\n\nonly the following  comments concerning appellant's arguments\r\n\non  appeal that the bond amount was insufficient and that the\r\n\nhearing was inadequate because no evidence was introduced.  \r\n\n          Under Rule 56.3  of the Puerto Rico  Rules of Civil\r\n\nProcedure, P.R.Laws Ann. Tit.  32, App. III, the amount  of a\r\n\nbond to support an ex parte attachment must be \"sufficient to\r\n\nsecure  all damages arising from the remedy.\"  P.R.R. Civ. P.\r\n\n56.3. The  Supreme Court  of Puerto  Rico has cautioned  that\r\n\n\"the  amount  [of  an  attachment  bond]  should  not  be  so\r\n\nexcessive as  to thwart  the plaintiffs' purpose  of securing\r\n\nthe  effectiveness of  the judgment  to be  timely rendered.\"\r\n\nConjugal  Partnership v.  Rodriguez, 116  D.P.R. 463  (1985).\r                                               \r\n\nMoreover,  \"the amount of the bond would always be subject to\r\n\nchange  if the  defendant  could  show  that the  damage  the\r\n\nattachment causes  him exceeds the  amount of the  bond.\" Id.\r                                                                         \r\n\nAppellant did  not object to the amount of the bond until the\r\n\nhearing  requested  by plaintiffs  and  she did  not  seek to\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nintroduce any evidence to demonstrate that  the amount of the\r\n\nbond  was  inadequate to  cover  potential  damages from  the\r\n\nattachment.   Under these circumstances,  the district  court\r\n\ndid not err in setting the amount of the bond at $20,000.\r\n\n          Appellant argues that  the post-attachment  hearing\r\n\nwas inadequate because it was not a full evidentiary hearing.\r\n\nFrom the minutes of  the hearing, it appears that  Rivera did\r\n\nnot request the opportunity to present evidence  or object to\r\n\nplaintiffs' failure  to present evidence.   Rule 56.5  of the\r\n\nPuerto  Rico Rules of Civil Procedure does not require a full\r\n\nevidentiary hearing.  Cf. HMG  Property  Investors v.  Parzue\r                                                                         \r\n\nIndus.  Rio Canas, 847 F.2d 908, 914 (1st Cir. 1988) (holding\r                             \r\n\nthat  Rule 56.2 \"requires notice and a fair chance to marshal\r\n\nsupporting facts  and theories -- nothing  more\").  Appellant\r\n\nstill  has not  explained  what evidence  ought to  have been\r\n\npresented  and how it would  have changed the  outcome of the\r\n\nattachment hearing.  \r\n\n          The district  court order affirming  the attachment\r\n\norder is affirmed.   The district court judgment in  favor of\r                             \r\n\nplaintiffs dated June  10, 1996,  is affirmed.   See Loc.

Attachment\r                                      \r\n\n          We affirm  the district court's order  dated August\r\n\n1, 1995 essentially for  the reasons stated therein.   We add\r\n\nonly the following  comments concerning appellant's arguments\r\n\non  appeal that the bond amount was insufficient and that the\r\n\nhearing was inadequate because no evidence was introduced.  \r\n\n          Under Rule 56.3  of the Puerto Rico  Rules of Civil\r\n\nProcedure, P.R.Laws Ann. Tit.  32, App. III, the amount  of a\r\n\nbond to support an ex parte attachment must be \"sufficient to\r\n\nsecure  all damages arising from the remedy.\"  P.R.R. Civ. P.\r\n\n56.3. The  Supreme Court  of Puerto  Rico has cautioned  that\r\n\n\"the  amount  [of  an  attachment  bond]  should  not  be  so\r\n\nexcessive as  to thwart  the plaintiffs' purpose  of securing\r\n\nthe  effectiveness of  the judgment  to be  timely rendered.\"\r\n\nConjugal  Partnership v.  Rodriguez, 116  D.P.R. 463  (1985).\r                                               \r\n\nMoreover,  \"the amount of the bond would always be subject to\r\n\nchange  if the  defendant  could  show  that the  damage  the\r\n\nattachment causes  him exceeds the  amount of the  bond.\" Id.\r                                                                         \r\n\nAppellant did  not object to the amount of the bond until the\r\n\nhearing  requested  by plaintiffs  and  she did  not  seek to\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nintroduce any evidence to demonstrate that  the amount of the\r\n\nbond  was  inadequate to  cover  potential  damages from  the\r\n\nattachment.   Under these circumstances,  the district  court\r\n\ndid not err in setting the amount of the bond at $20,000.\r\n\n          Appellant argues that  the post-attachment  hearing\r\n\nwas inadequate because it was not a full evidentiary hearing.\r\n\nFrom the minutes of  the hearing, it appears that  Rivera did\r\n\nnot request the opportunity to present evidence  or object to\r\n\nplaintiffs' failure  to present evidence.   Rule 56.5  of the\r\n\nPuerto  Rico Rules of Civil Procedure does not require a full\r\n\nevidentiary hearing.  Cf. HMG  Property  Investors v.
