Grant, Senior Legal  Counsel, Rhode Island  Department\r                             \r\nof  Corrections,  on Memorandum  in  Support  of  Motion  for  Summary\r\nDisposition, for appellees.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n          Per Curiam.  Bernardo Figueroa, who is incarcerated\r                                \r\r\n\nin  the Maximum  Security  prison at  the Adult  Correctional\r\n\nInstitution  in  Rhode  Island,  appeals  from  the  district\r\n\ncourt's dismissal of his  suit against state prison officials\r\n\nunder 42 U.S.C.    1983.   We affirm,  substantially for  the\r\n\nreasons given in the magistrate judge's report dated July 11,\r\n\n1995, which the district  court adopted as its decision.   We\r\n\nadd only the following comments.\r\n\n          1.  Figueroa suggests that Sandin v. Conner, 115 S.\r                                                                 \r\n\nCt. 2293 (1995), would not bar his due process claims because\r\n\nthe  disciplinary decision  against  him could  affect future\r\n\nclassification  or parole  decisions.   The  chairman of  the\r\n\nstate parole board testified  below that inmate misconduct is\r\n\nonly  one of  the factors considered  in granting  or denying\r\n\nparole and  that an  inmate may explain  adverse disciplinary\r\n\ndecisions  to  the  parole  board.   Thus,  the  disciplinary\r\n\ndecision  against Figueroa will  not \"inevitably\"  affect the\r\n\nlength of his sentence  and its existence does not  give rise\r\n\nto a protected liberty interest.  See id. at 2302 (dictum).  \r                                                     \r\n\n          2.  Although the complaint asserted that defendants\r\n\nhad  harassed Figueroa because of his race or for retaliatory\r\n\nreasons, Figueroa failed  to raise that claim  at the hearing\r\n\nbefore the magistrate.   Nor did he raise it  with sufficient\r\n\nclarity  in his  objections  to the  magistrate's report  and\r\n\nrecommendation.  We therefore deem that claim abandoned.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nBorden v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 836 F.2d 4,\r                                                            \r\n\n6 (1st Cir. 1987) (per curiam).\r\n\n          3.   The district court  did not err  in failing to\r\n\naddress Figueroa's  claim that  defendants  had violated  the\r\n\nMorris  v.  Travisono consent  decree.    We have  held  that\r                                 \r\n\ninmates  may not  bring individual  section 1983  actions for\r\n\ninjunctive or  declaratory relief which are  based on consent\r\n\ndecree violations.  See Martel v. Fridovich, 14 F.3d 1, 3 n.4\r                                                       \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1993).\r\n\n          4.  The magistrate  judge was authorized to conduct\r\n\nall   necessary  hearings   and   to  issue   a  report   and\r\n\nrecommendation  for review  by the  district court,  which he\r\n\ndid.   Because he  was not  authorized to and  did not  enter\r\n\njudgment in this case, the parties' consent was not required.\r\n\nSee 28 U.S.C.   636(b)(1)(B) &amp; (c)(1).1\r                                                  1\r               \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1We  note  one  problem with  Magistrate  Judge Boudewyns'\r               1\r\nreport and  recommendation to  the district court  which does\r\nnot affect the disposition of this appeal.  At the end of his\r\nreport, the  magistrate judge  stated that the  \"[f]ailure to\r\nfile  specific objections  in a  timely manner  constitutes a\r\nwaiver of the right to  review by the district court.\"   In a\r\nfootnote, he cites Park  Motor Mart, Inc. v. Ford  Motor Co.,\r                                                                        \r\n616  F.2d 603 (1st Cir. 1980), and United States v. Valencia-\r                                                                         \r\nCopete, 792 F.2d 4 (1st Cir.  1986) (per curiam).  The quoted\r                  \r\nlanguage accurately states our holding in Park Motor.  But it\r                                                                \r\ndoes not  encompass our holding in  Valencia-Copete, where we\r                                                               \r\ndirected all magistrates to include in their reports a notice\r\nthat  failure to timely object  to a report  would waive \"the\r\nright  to appeal the district court's decision.\"  792 F.2d at\r                                                          \r\n6 (emphasis added).  We  reiterate that all magistrate judges\r\nin  this Circuit are required to include in their reports the\r\nstatement that failure to file specific objections to reports\r\nin a  timely manner waives  both the right  to review by  the\r\ndistrict  court and the right  to appeal the district court's\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\ndecision.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
