This  case  comes  to  us  on\r                                       \r\n\npetition for writ of mandamus directing the district judge to\r\n\nrecuse himself in  this case.  The district  judge denied the\r\n\nmotion  to recuse  without  an  evidentiary  hearing  or  any\r\n\ndetailed  submission by the opposing parties.   Thus, the raw\r\n\nfacts set forth below, and assumed to be true for purposes of\r\n\nthis  opinion,  are  largely  drawn  from  the  petition  for\r\n\nmandamus and related filings by petitioners.  \r\n\n                        I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n     After  the 1992 municipal  elections in  Florida, Puerto\r\n\nRico, the candidate for mayor  of Florida affiliated with the\r\n\nNew  Progressive Party unseated  the incumbent mayor  who was\r\n\naffiliated with the  Popular Democratic Party.   According to\r\n\nthe  complaint later filed by petitioners, who are plaintiffs\r\n\nin  the district  court, all  14  of them  were dismissed  or\r\n\ndemoted in  early January 1993.   Some of the  plaintiffs had\r\n\nserved  as assistants  to  the  mayor  and  others  had  been\r\n\nemployees of Florida's elder community center.  \r\n\n     The suit was  brought as a civil rights  action under 42\r\n\nU.S.C.   1983.  Plaintiffs charged that their firing violated\r\n\ntheir constitutional free speech rights under Elrod v. Burns,\r                                                                        \r\n\n427 U.S. 347  (1976), Branti v. Finkel, 445  U.S. 507 (1980),\r                                                  \r\n\nand Rutan  v. Republican  Party, 497 U.S.  62 (1990).   These\r                                           \r\n\ncases  limit,  although  they do  not  wholly  eliminate, the\r\n\nability   of  a  new  administration  to  dismiss  or  demote\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nemployees  of  the  old administration  on  account  of party\r\n\naffiliation.  Plaintiffs sought damages and reinstatement.\r\n\n     In  November 1995,  a motion  for  summary judgment  was\r\n\nfiled on  behalf of defendants,  who included the  new mayor,\r\n\nthe municipality  and others.   The  summary judgment  motion\r\n\nurged  that the  former mayoral  assistants  had confidential\r\n\npositions  that excepted  them from  the  limit on  political\r\n\nfirings and also asserted that in other cases, the assistants\r\n\nhad been hired  illegally.  Defendants  said that the  former\r\n\nworkers at the elder community center had been discharged due\r\n\nto lack of funds.\r\n\n     On June  13, 1996, in  an effort to reach  a settlement,\r\n\nthe district  judge met  in chambers  with counsel  from both\r\n\nsides, with the  defendant mayor, and with  Florida's interim\r\n\ndirector  of human  resources.   Then  the judge,  apparently\r\n\nwithout   objection,   met   separately  with   both   sides.\r\n\nPlaintiffs'  counsel  was  Carlos  Del  Valle  Cruz;  defense\r\n\ncounsel  included Jose Gaztambide,  who at some  earlier time\r\n\nhad served as a law clerk to the district judge.  \r\n\n     Following  their  separate  meetings  with  the   judge,\r\n\ncounsel for both  sides met privately to  discuss settlement.\r\n\nDel  Valle later  filed  an  unsworn  statement,  made  under\r\n\npenalty of perjury,  describing his  meeting with  Gaztambide\r\n\nand  with  Luis  Plaza, another  defense  attorney.   Crucial\r\n\nlanguage from the unsworn statement follows:\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\n     In  said conference,  they [the  defense attorneys]\r\n     made a settlement  offer on the  basis on (sic)  of\r\n     the Court's  prospective ruling on  their [defense]\r\n     motion  for summary  judgment.   Counsel Gaztambide\r\n     stated  that the Court would be dismissing the case\r\n     as to five (5) of the plaintiffs, was yet unsure of\r\n     his decision as to three (3) of the plaintiffs, and\r\n     would  deny the motion  for summary judgment  as to\r\n     the remaining six (6) plaintiffs.\r\n\n     Defense  counsel   then  reviewed   an  earlier   letter\r\n\ncontaining  settlement  offers  for   each  plaintiff.    The\r\n\nstatement continues:   \"Next to  the name of  each plaintiff,\r\n\ncounsel Gaztambide made a downward slant  for all those cases\r\n\nwhich the  Court  would be  dismissing . . . an upward  slant\r\n\nnext to the names of the cases  the Court was yet unsure of .\r\n\n. . and  a circle next to the names of those cases [in which]\r\n\nthe Court would deny the motion for summary judgment . . . .\"\r\n\n     Del Valle objected that  defense counsel had information\r\n\nabout \"a prospective dismissal\" of certain of the cases.  All\r\n\nthree  lawyers returned to  the judge  who continued  to urge\r\n\nsettlement of the case.  When defense counsel Plaza said that\r\n\nDel Valle had an ethical obligation  to report the settlement\r\n\noffers to his  clients, Del Valle said that  his clients were\r\n\nin court \"because they believed in the Constitution and their\r\n\nright to be made whole.\"\r\n\n     According to  Del Valle's statement, the  district judge\r\n\nthen  intervened  \"to  express  that the  undersigned  should\r\n\n`forget the Constitution,' because several of my clients were\r\n\n`political  sweet potatoes' that cared more about having some\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nmoney  in  their  pockets  than  about  their  Constitutional\r\n\nrights.\"   The  judge then  proposed a  settlement figure  of\r\n\napproximately  $200,000 that \"counsel  agreed to recommend to\r\n\ntheir clients.\"  Del Valle did meet with his clients, but the\r\n\nupshot  was  a  motion  by  Del  Valle,  accompanied  by  the\r\n\nstatement just  described, requesting  the district judge  to\r\n\nrecuse himself pursuant to 28 U.S.C.    144, 455(a) and (b).\r\n\n     The motion for recusal was filed on June 17, 1996.  When\r\n\nno action  had been taken  on the motion after  eight months,\r\n\nplaintiffs, on February 26, 1997, filed a motion requesting a\r\n\nruling.   When  again there  was no  response, plaintiffs  on\r\n\nApril 19, 1997, filed a petition for writ of mandamus in this\r\n\ncourt.  Ten days later, on April 29, 1997, the district court\r\n\nissued an opinion and order denying the motion for recusal.  \r\n\n     In the  28-page opinion  and order,  the district  court\r\n\nconcluded that disqualification was not required under either\r\n\nsection 144 or  section 455.  The district  judge stated that\r\n\nhe  had, \"as  is customary,  discussed  separately with  each\r\n\nparty's counsel the perceived strengths and weaknesses of the\r\n\ncase . . . .\"   The opinion continued:  \"The undersigned  did\r\n\nnot  tell either party  definitively what his  decision would\r\n\nbe--he merely gave both parties his preliminary impression of\r\n\nthe possibilities for success as to each claim.\"\r\n\n     This  decision mooted plaintiffs'  request to us  for an\r\n\norder directing the district judge to rule.  But the mandamus\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\npetition  also requested that  this court order  the district\r\n\njudge to recuse himself.   Accordingly, on May 23, 1997, this\r\n\ncourt  asked the  parties to  file  memoranda addressing  the\r\n\nmerits of  the recusal  claims and  the overhanging  question\r\n\nwhether   review  by  mandamus  was  warranted.    Del  Valle\r\n\ncomplied;  defense  counsel  relied largely  on  the district\r\n\njudge's decision.\r\n\n     On June  6, 1997, the  district court issued  an opinion\r\n\nand partial  judgment disposing  of the  pending motions  for\r\n\nsummary   judgment  filed  by  the  defendants.    The  court\r\n\ndismissed  certain claims  and, as  to  others, scheduled  an\r\n\nevidentiary hearing  for later  in June and  a trial  date in\r\n\nAugust 1997.   At the request of plaintiffs,  this court then\r\n\ngranted a stay of further proceedings in the district court.\r\n\n                    II.  DISCUSSION       \r\n\n     In this case, there is  no final judgment appealable  as\r\n\nof right.  Ordinarily,  a district judge's refusal to  recuse\r\n\nis  reviewable  only  on  appeal  of a  final  judgment;  the\r\n\ncollateral order doctrine  does not apply.   Nevertheless, in\r\n\nunusual  situations,  interim  review of  such  a  refusal is\r\n\navailable through writ of mandamus.  See In re Cargill, Inc.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n66 F.3d 1256, 1260 (1st Cir. 1995),  cert. denied, 116 S. Ct.\r                                                             \r\n\n1545 (1996) (collecting cases).\r\n\n     The  usual first requirement  for mandamus in  a recusal\r\n\nmatter is that the party  seeking the writ show a \"clear  and\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nindisputable\"  entitlement to relief.   In re  United States,\r                                                                        \r\n\n666 F.2d  690, 695  (1st Cir.  1981); see  13A C. Wright,  A.\r                                                     \r\n\nMiller &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure   3553, at\r                                                              \r\n\n661   (2d  ed.  1984).    Interlocutory  review,  after  all,\r\n\ninterferes with the  ordinary processes of trial  and appeal;\r\n\nand absent interlocutory  review, many issues wash  out along\r\n\nthe way.  But over  the years, appeals courts have  held that\r\n\ngiven  a clear  error by  the district  judge in  refusing to\r                          \r\n\nrecuse,  a stronger argument  exists for immediate  review by\r\n\nmandamus.\r\n\n     Mandamus is  a discretionary  writ and,  even where  the\r\n\nmerits clearly favor  the petitioner, relief may  be withheld\r\n\nfor  lack of  irreparable injury  or  based on  a balance  of\r\n\nequities.  These are malleable concepts and often  matters of\r\n\ndegree.  Some  opinions suggest that  a clear entitlement  to\r                                                         \r\n\nrecusal  may  itself  warrant  immediate  relief,  absent  an\r\n\nequitable bar, because    public confidence is enhanced where\r\n\na clearly disqualified judge is removed  swiftly.  See, e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nIn re United States, 666 F.2d at 694.\r                               \r\n\n     In  all events,  in recusal  cases,  mandamus is  almost\r\n\nalways withheld--we do not  say always--unless the petitioner\r\n\ndemonstrates that  it is \"clearly\"  entitled to relief.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nCargill, 66 F.3d at 1262.   Here, the plaintiffs have invoked\r                   \r\n\ntwo separate  bases  for disqualification,  sections 144  and\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\n455, whose procedural  incidents differ widely.   We consider\r\n\nthem separately and in order.  \r\n\n     Section  144.   This provision begins  with a  core one-\r                             \r\n\nsentence paragraph:\r\n\n          Whenever  a  party  to  any  proceeding  in  a\r\n     district  court  makes  and  files   a  timely  and\r\n     sufficient affidavit that the judge before whom the\r\n     matter  is pending has a personal bias or prejudice\r\n     either  against  him  or in  favor  of  any adverse\r\n     party, such judge shall proceed no further therein,\r\n     but  another judge shall  be assigned to  hear such\r\n     proceeding.\r\n\nA second paragraph  sets forth a timeliness  requirement (not\r\n\nhere in dispute),  provides that the party can  only file one\r\n\nsuch affidavit  in any case,  and  requires a  certificate of\r\n\ncounsel of record that the affidavit is made in good faith.\r\n\n     Section  144 is  unusual because  it  requires that  the\r\n\ndistrict  judge accept the  affidavit as true  even though it\r\n\nmay contain averments that are false  and may be known to  be\r\n\nso to the judge.  See United  States v. Kelley, 712 F.2d 884,\r                                                          \r\n\n889 (1st Cir. 1983).   However, penalties for perjury and the\r\n\ncertificate of counsel tend to discourage outright falsehood.\r\n\nAnd  the possibility remains,  although not developed  in the\r\n\nstatute,  that the  transferee judge  might  hold a  hearing,\r\n\nconclude that the affidavit was false and transfer the action\r\n\nback to the original judge.\r\n\n     Nevertheless,  courts have  responded  to the  draconian\r\n\nprocedure--automatic transfer  based  solely  on  one  side's\r\n\naffidavit--by  insisting on a  firm showing in  the affidavit\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\nthat the judge does have  a personal bias or prejudice toward\r\n\na party, and also by  insisting on strict compliance with the\r\n\nprocedural  requirements of the  section.1  And,  while there\r\n\nare various bases  at law for recusal, the  only one governed\r\n\nby  section 144 and subject to  its procedural advantages for\r\n\nthe recusing party are \"personal bias or prejudice.\"  \r\n\n     We start with  procedural issues.  Section  144's second\r\n\nparagraph requires the  affidavit of \"a party\"  setting forth\r\n\n\"the  facts and  the  reasons  for the  belief  that bias  or\r\n\nprejudice exists\" and  a separate \"certificate of  counsel of\r\n\nrecord  stating  that it  [the  affidavit]  is made  in  good\r\n\nfaith.\"  Here, there was neither an affidavit of a party  nor\r\n\na  certificate of counsel--only a single unsworn statement of\r\n\ncounsel setting  forth facts under  penalty of perjury.   The\r\n\npapers are thus doubly defective.\r\n\n     Still, an unsworn statement under penalty of perjury has\r\n\nthe  same effect  as an affidavit.   28  U.S.C.   1746.   The\r\n\nmissing  certificate   of  counsel  may   also  be  redundant\r\n\n(although it still should have been supplied) where, as here,\r\n\nthe motion and unsworn statement  are both signed by counsel,\r\n\nmaking counsel  subject to the good faith  strictures of Fed.\r\n\nR. Civ. P. 11.  One might be more concerned about the lack of\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     1See,  e.g., Glass v.

It seems\r\n\nto  us  to  satisfy the  underlying  purpose  of the  recusal\r\n\nstatute to  allow  Del Valle  to  make the  necessary  filing\r\n\nrather than to  insist that the plaintiffs  themselves repeat\r\n\nthe same facts on a hearsay basis.\r\n\n     Starting with defense counsel's alleged inside knowledge\r\n\nof the judge's intentions, the problem is not one of ex parte\r                                                                         \r\n\ncontacts as  such; absent objection, separate  discussions in\r\n\nthe context of settlement agreements  are common occurrences.\r\n\nAnd,  in pressing each side to  take a reasonable view of its\r\n\nsituation,  judges   often  give  the   parties  the  court's\r\n\nimpression of apparent  strengths and weaknesses.   There are\r\n\ndangers in  this practice, of  course, but clients  are often\r\n\nwell served by settlements, and settlements often result from\r\n\nrealistic appraisals of strengths and weaknesses.\r\n\n     Rather,  the claim  of  bias  or  prejudice  here  rests\r\n\nprimarily on  the  inference, drawn  by plaintiffs'  counsel,\r\n\nthat the judge told defense counsel more or less definitively\r                               \r\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\nhow the judge planned to rule on the summary judgment motions\r\n\nand  on  the  implication  that the  judge  gave  no  similar\r\n\ninformation  to plaintiffs'  counsel.    If  so,  this  would\r\n\nobviously   give  one   side   a  substantial   advantage  in\r\n\nnegotiations.    We   will  assume  arguendo  that   such  an\r                                                        \r\n\nindiscretion  could  at  least  arguably  be  grounds  for  a\r\n\nreasonable  inference of  bias  or  prejudice toward  someone\r\n\n(whether  toward a  party or  counsel  might require  further\r\n\ninformation).\r\n\n     Under  section 144, recusal must be based upon the facts\r\n\nalleged  in  the  affidavit,  so we  have  to  disregard  the\r\n\ndistrict judge's own  later denial that  he revealed how  the\r\n\nmotions were  to be  decided.   See Kelly,  712 F.2d at  889.\r                                                     \r\n\nBut, by the same token,  automatic removal of the judge under\r\n\nthat  section requires  averment of  facts  showing that  the\r\n\njudge \"has\" a personal bias  or prejudice, not that the judge\r\n\nmight have such a bias or prejudice or that grounds exist for\r\n\nfurther  inquiry.  As  explained below, \"mights\"  and further\r\n\ninquiries can  always be  pursued  under section  455--where,\r\n\nhowever, the affidavit itself can be challenged.\r\n\n     The  difficulty with  Del Valle's  unsworn statement  is\r\n\nthat it  does not show  that the district judge  revealed his\r                             \r\n\nintended disposition of  any of the summary  judgment motions\r\n\nto defense  counsel.   The statement does  not even  say that\r\n\ndefense counsel  made  such a  claim.   Instead, the  remarks\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\nattributed to  defense counsel--the pertinent ones  have been\r\n\nquoted in full  above--show only that defense  counsel sought\r\n\nto convey  the impression  that he knew  how the  judge would\r\n\nrule, while carefully refraining from explaining how he knew.\r\n\n     The unsworn statement itself shows that both plaintiffs'\r\n\ncounsel and defense counsel had come from separate settlement\r\n\nconferences where (in common experience) judges often discuss\r\n\nthe strengths and weaknesses of the claims.  There is nothing\r\n\nin the unsworn statement to indicate that defense counsel was\r\n\ndoing more  than  making an  intelligent prediction,  perhaps\r\n\npuffing a bit to enhance  his bargaining position.  This does\r\n\nnot prove that the judge  revealed to defense counsel how the\r                                    \r\n\njudge intended to rule on the pending motions.\r\n\n     We turn next to the judge's alleged statement  that some\r\n\nof  the plaintiffs  were  \"political  sweet  potatoes.\"    We\r\n\nunderstand this term  to mean political hack,  see Rodriguez-\r                                                                         \r\n\nGarcia  v. Davila, 904 F.2d 90,  100 n.10 (1st Cir. 1990), or\r                             \r\n\nas the district  judge put  it in  another instance,  \"people\r\n\nappointed  to more or less useless jobs as political favors,\"\r\n\nsee  Rodriguez-Garcia v. Davila, No. 87-1411, 1988 WL 124046,\r                                           \r\n\n*2 (D.P.R.  Nov. 9, 1988).   Under section 144,  the question\r\n\nagain  is whether  such a  reference shows  personal bias  or\r\n\nprejudice.\r\n\n     Assuming that the statement does show  a predisposition,\r\n\nthere  is no  evidence that  the statement  was improper.   A\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                         -12-\r\r\n\njudge is  ordinarily entitled to  form a view of  the parties\r\n\nthat is favorable or unfavorable,  so long as it derives from\r\n\ninformation in the case; there may be exceptions but they are\r\n\n\"rare\" indeed.   See Liteky  v. United States, 510  U.S. 540,\r                                                         \r\n\n554  (1994).   Here, the  district judge  had before  him the\r\n\nsummary judgment  filing in  which the defendants  challenged\r\n\nthe bona fides of various plaintiffs.  There is no indication\r\n\nthat  the judge  knew  the  individual  plaintiffs  from  any\r\n\ncontext other than the current judicial proceedings.\r\n\n    Judges   constantly   form   personal   opinions   during\r\n\nproceedings.  It may be wiser not  to express such views, and\r\n\nalmost always prudent to avoid epithets, but disqualification\r\n\nis almost never required where the judge's opinions are based\r\n\non  the  proceedings.   Inaccurate  findings  based  on those\r\n\nopinions may lead  to reversal on appeal but  not to recusal.\r\n\nWhether the words  used by the district judge  suggest a lack\r\n\nof impartiality  is  a different  question,  properly  raised\r\n\nunder the  objective standard  of section  455 and  addressed\r\n\nbelow.\r\n\n     There is even less to the claim that the judge  showed a\r\n\npersonal bias or  prejudice when he said, if he did say, that\r\n\nthe  plaintiffs should  \"forget the  Constitution.\"   However\r\n\ndramatic the phrase may sound  in the abstract, in context it\r\n\nwas  here used as part  of a perfectly permissible suggestion\r\n\nby the district judge, namely,  that counsel ask his  clients\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                         -13-\r\r\n\nwhether  they were more  interested in a  monetary settlement\r\n\nthan  in an  opportunity to  express principle.   Judges  say\r\n\nsomething of the sort in many settlement conferences.   \r\n\n     Section 455.  In its  present version section 455 is the\r                            \r\n\nmore  modern and complete recusal statute  and applies to all\r\n\nfederal  judges.   There is  no threshold  requirement  of an\r\n\naffidavit  or any other  format for raising  a recusal issue.\r\n\nIn fact,  the judge is  expected to recuse sua  sponte, where\r                                                                  \r\n\nnecessary, even  if no party has requested  it.  Nor is there\r\n\nanything  to prevent the party seeking recusal from trying to\r\n\nengage  in discovery incident  to a recusal  motion, although\r\n\nthe  allowance  of   such  discovery  is  within   the  sound\r\n\ndiscretion  of the  court.   See, e.g.,  Cheeves v.  Southern\r                                                                         \r\n\nClays, Inc., 797 F. Supp. 1570, 1580 (M.D. Ga. 1992).\r                       \r\n\n     On the  other hand,  under section 455,  a judge  is not\r\n\ncompelled  automatically  to accept  as true  the allegations\r\n\nmade by the party seeking recusal.  To the  extent that facts\r\n\nare in dispute, factual determinations are  made by the judge\r\n\nwhose recusal is in question, and the same judge also decides\r\n\nwhether the facts trigger disqualification, subject always to\r\n\nreview  on appeal,  normally for abuse  of discretion.   See,\r                                                                         \r\n\ne.g.,  Town  of  Norfolk  v.  United  States  Army  Corps  of\r                                                                         \r\n\nEngineers, 968 F.2d 1438, 1460 (1st Cir. 1992).\r                     \r\n\n     It might seem  odd that recusal issues should be decided\r\n\nby  the very judge  whose recusal is in  question.  But there\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                         -14-\r\r\n\nare  other considerations  at work,  including  a desire  for\r\n\nexpedition and  a concern to  discourage judge shopping.   In\r\n\naddition, one of the grounds for recusal under section 455 is\r\n\nthe far-reaching direction  that the judge recuse  himself or\r\n\nherself \"in any proceeding in which his [or her] impartiality\r\n\nmight reasonably be questioned.\"   28 U.S.C.   455(a).  Thus,\r\n\ntaken together, the provisions of section 455  tend to strike\r\n\na reasonable balance.\r\n\n     In  our case, the  plaintiffs have invoked  both section\r\n\n455(a)  and section  455(b)(1), which  repeats  the bias  and\r\n\nprejudice language of section 144.   For present purposes, we\r\n\nfocus  on the impartiality language of section 455(a) because\r\n\nit covers the same ground  and reaches even further.  Section\r\n\n455(a) is in  no way limited to \"personal\"  bias or prejudice\r\n\n\"concerning a party\" and--unlike sections 144 and 455(b)(1)--\r\n\ndoes  not  require  that  bias   or  prejudice  in  fact   be\r                                                                    \r\n\nestablished.

Chantel, 902 F.2d 1018,  1023\r                                                   \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1990).\r\n\n          Rather,  section 455(a)  requires recusal  wherever\r\n\nthe   objective  circumstances   create   an  appearance   of\r                                                                    \r\n\npartiality.  This does not  mean that required recusal can be\r\n\nbased  on  an  \"unsupported, irrational,  or  highly  tenuous\r\n\nspeculation.\"  In re United States, 666 F.2d at 694.  It does\r                                              \r\n\nmean  that where the appearance of partiality exists, recusal\r\n\nis  required regardless of  the judge's own  inner conviction\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                         -15-\r\r\n\nthat  he  or she  can  decide  the  case fairly  despite  the\r\n\ncircumstances.

As we  have  said, section  455,\r\n\nunlike section  144, is  not limited to  facts alleged  in an\r\n\naffidavit.  But Del Valle's statement was itself insufficient\r\n\nto show that  the judge made the alleged  disclosure; and the\r\n\nonly  additional pertinent fact  beyond the statement  is the\r\n\njudge's  denial  that  he  did  so, hardly  of  help  to  the\r                           \r\n\nplaintiff.\r\n\n     Plaintiffs now attack the judge's statement that he gave\r\n\nboth sides a preliminary appraisal:   Del Valle now claims in\r\n\nhis mandamus  memorandum  that in  the settlement  conference\r\n\nwith  the  judge he  was  told virtually  nothing  even about\r\n\nlikely outcomes.   But new  assertions of fact by  counsel in\r\n\nappellate briefs  come too  late, see  Hurney v.  Carver, 602\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 993, 996 (1st Cir. 1979); Renovitch v.

Without\r                                           \r\n\nknowing both, any comparison is hopeless.\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                         -16-\r\r\n\n     We  return now, under the standard of section 455(a), to\r\n\nthe   district  court's  alleged  remark  that  some  of  the\r\n\nplaintiffs  were  \"political  sweet  potatoes.\"   As  already\r\n\nnoted, a  judge is  normally free to  develop views  from the\r\n\nrecord as  the case  proceeds, and there  is no  showing here\r\n\nthat  the  judge's  assessment came  from  any  other source.\r\n\nFurther,  the  judge's  supposed  comment--like  his  alleged\r\n\nadmonition  to  \"forget  the  Constitution\"--was  in  context\r\n\nlittle  more than  a warning  to  plaintiffs' counsel,  quite\r\n\nrelevant to the settlement then being urged, that some of his\r\n\nclients might do better by compromise than at trial.  \r\n\n     Two  other assertions  remain to be  addressed.   In his\r\n\nunsworn statement, plaintiffs' counsel  referred to the  fact\r\n\nthat  one of  the defense  counsel had  once clerked  for the\r\n\njudge,  an issue  unrelated to  party bias  or  prejudice but\r                                                 \r\n\nperhaps  pertinent to  appearance  of  partiality.    And  on\r\n\nappeal, plaintiffs'  counsel  widens his  claims slightly  by\r\n\nsaying  that  the  district  judge  had  once  been  actively\r\n\nconnected  with  political  causes  opposed  by  the  Popular\r\n\nDemocratic Party.  Neither ground  is expressly offered as an\r\n\nindependent basis for recusal, and for good reason.\r\n\n     It is common knowledge in the profession that former law\r\n\nclerks  practice regularly before  judges for whom  they once\r\n\nclerked.  Courts  often have prophylactic rules that forbid a\r\n\nformer law clerk from appearing  in that court for a year  or\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                         -17-\r\r\n\nmore after the  clerkship, see, e.g., 1st Cir.  R. 46, but no\r                                                \r\n\nsuch rule is claimed to have been violated in this case.  And\r\n\nany lawyer  who studies  a judge's past  rulings can  make an\r\n\ninformed guess as to  how the judge is likely  to approach an\r\n\nissue.\r\n\n     So, too, appointees  to the bench  have sometimes had  a\r\n\nformer  active connection with  a political party.   But many\r\n\njudges also  sit, usually  after a  self-imposed cooling  off\r\n\nperiod, on cases involving former clients (assuming always no\r\n\ncurrent financial ties and that the judge did not work on the\r\n\nsame  or  a  related  matter  while  in  practice).    Former\r                                                                         \r\n\naffiliations with  a party may  persuade a judge not  to sit;\r\n\nbut  they are  rarely a  basis for  compelled recusal.   See,\r                                                                         \r\n\ne.g., In re United States, 666 F.2d at  696; Matter of Mason,\r                                                                        \r\n\n916 F.2d 384, 386 (7th Cir. 1990).\r\n\n     All this being said, the whole is sometimes greater than\r\n\nthe sum  of the parts.   The cumulative  effect of  a judge's\r\n\nindividual  actions,  comments  and  past associations  could\r\n\nraise  some  question about  impartiality,  even though  none\r\n\n(taken alone) would require recusal.  And, while the abuse of\r\n\ndiscretion standard is a forgiving one, perhaps in an extreme\r\n\ncase the cumulative  effect would warrant reversal  on direct\r\n\nappeal if the judge refused to recuse.  \r\n\n     But  the primary  condition  of  mandamus  is  that  the\r\n\npetitioner be clearly entitled to relief.   Judges may choose\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                         -18-\r\r\n\nto step aside  in close cases; the \"duty  to sit\" concept has\r\n\nbeen modified by amended section  455.  See Blizard, 601 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\nat 1220-21; see also 13A  Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper   3549,  at\r                                \r\n\n611.   But mandamus requires  a case not  merely close to the\r\n\nline but clearly  over it; and the line  itself is especially\r\n\nblurred where no incident is  sufficient and the claim is one\r\n\nof cumulative effects.  This case is certainly not so clearly\r\n\nover the line as to justify the shortcut of mandamus.\r\n\n                       III.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n     When  this case returns  to the district  court, section\r\n\n144 will  be out  of the picture;  Del Valle's  statement was\r\n\ninsufficient on  its face  to show bias  or prejudice,  so it\r\n\nfails  regardless of mandamus requirements, and only one such\r\n\naffidavit  may be  filed  in  an action.    The situation  is\r\n\notherwise under section  455(a); our decision, resting  as it\r\n\ndoes   partly   upon   the   mandamus  standard,   does   not\r\n\nautomatically prevent the further development of  the record,\r\n\nnor an appeal after a final judgment.\r\n\n     The possibility left  open may carry some  suggestion of\r\n\nreproof.   We therefore  note that as  yet no  showing exists\r\n\nthat the district  judge gave any  improper advantage in  his\r\n\ndisclosures to  defense counsel,  which is  the closest  that\r\n\nplaintiffs have come  to a specific and serious  charge.  Our\r\n\nonly  present stricture  is that  a  district judge,  however\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                         -19-\r\r\n\nbusy, ought not  let a recusal motion alleging  personal bias\r\n\nand prejudice sit dormant for eight months.\r\n\n     The petition for a writ of mandamus is denied.  The stay\r                                                              \r\n\nof proceedings in  the district court is vacated.   Each side\r                                                            \r\n\nshall bear its own costs.\r\n\n     It is so ordered.\r                                 \r\n\n                             -20-\r                                         -20-\r\r\n",

The district judge denied the motion to recuse without an evidentiary hearing or any detailed submission by the opposing parties.  Thus, the raw facts set forth below, and assumed to be true for purposes of this opinion, are largely drawn from the petition for mandamus and related filings by petitioners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the 1992 municipal elections in Florida, Puerto Rico, the candidate for mayor of Florida affiliated with the New Progressive Party unseated the incumbent mayor who was affiliated with the Popular Democratic Party.  According to the complaint later filed by petitioners, who are plaintiffs in the district court, all 14 of them were dismissed or demoted in early January 1993.  Some of the plaintiffs had served as assistants to the mayor and others had been employees of Florida's elder community center.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The suit was brought as a civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983.  Plaintiffs charged that their firing violated their constitutional free speech rights under Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976), Branti v. Finkel, 445 U.S. 507, 100 S.Ct. 1287, 63 L.Ed.2d 574 (1980), and Rutan v. Republican Party, 497 U.S. 62, 110 S.Ct. 2729, 111 L.Ed.2d 52 (1990).  These cases limit, although they do not wholly eliminate, the ability of a new administration to dismiss or demote employees of the old administration on account of party affiliation.  Plaintiffs sought damages and reinstatement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1995, a motion for summary judgment was filed on behalf of defendants, who included the new mayor, the municipality and others.  The summary judgment motion urged that the former mayoral assistants had confidential positions that excepted them from the limit on political firings and also asserted that in other cases, the assistants had been hired illegally.  Defendants said that the former workers at the elder community center had been discharged due to lack of funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 13, 1996, in an effort to reach a settlement, the district judge met in chambers with counsel from both sides, with the defendant mayor, and with Florida's interim director of human resources.  Then the judge, apparently without objection, met separately with both sides.  Plaintiffs' counsel was Carlos Del Valle Cruz;  defense counsel included Jose Gaztambide, who at some earlier time had served as a law clerk to the district judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following their separate meetings with the judge, counsel for both sides met privately to discuss settlement.  Del Valle later filed an unsworn statement, made under penalty of perjury, describing his meeting with Gaztambide and with Luis Plaza, another defense attorney.  Crucial language from the unsworn statement follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>In said conference, they [the defense attorneys] made a settlement offer on the basis on (sic) of the Court's prospective ruling on their [defense] motion for summary judgment.  Counsel Gaztambide stated that the Court would be dismissing the case as to five (5) of the plaintiffs, was yet unsure of his decision as to three (3) of the plaintiffs, and would deny the motion for summary judgment as to the remaining six (6) plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense counsel then reviewed an earlier letter containing settlement offers for each plaintiff.  The statement continues:  \"Next to the name of each plaintiff, counsel Gaztambide made a downward slant for all those cases which the Court would be dismissing ... an upward slant next to the names of the cases the Court was yet unsure of ... and a circle next to the names of those cases [in which] the Court would deny the motion for summary judgment....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Del Valle objected that defense counsel had information about \"a prospective dismissal\" of certain of the cases.  All three lawyers returned to the judge who continued to urge settlement of the case.  When defense counsel Plaza said that Del Valle had an ethical obligation to report the settlement offers to his clients, Del Valle said that his clients were in court \"because they believed in the Constitution and their right to be made whole.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Del Valle's statement, the district judge then intervened \"to express that the undersigned should 'forget the Constitution,' because several of my clients were 'political sweet potatoes' that cared more about having some money in their pockets than about their Constitutional rights.\"   The judge then proposed a settlement figure of approximately $200,000 that \"counsel agreed to recommend to their clients.\"   Del Valle did meet with his clients, but the upshot was a motion by Del Valle, accompanied by the statement just described, requesting the district judge to recuse himself pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 144, 455(a) and (b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The motion for recusal was filed on June 17, 1996.  When no action had been taken on the motion after eight months, plaintiffs, on February 26, 1997, filed a motion requesting a ruling.  When again there was no response, plaintiffs on April 19, 1997, filed a petition for writ of mandamus in this court.  Ten days later, on April 29, 1997, the district court issued an opinion and order denying the motion for recusal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the 28-page opinion and order, the district court concluded that disqualification was not required under either section 144 or section 455.  The district judge stated that he had, \"as is customary, discussed separately with each party's counsel the perceived strengths and weaknesses of the case....\"  The opinion continued:  \"The undersigned did not tell either party definitively what his decision would be--he merely gave both parties his preliminary impression of the possibilities for success as to each claim.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This decision mooted plaintiffs' request to us for an order directing the district judge to rule.  But the mandamus petition also requested that this court order the district judge to recuse himself.  Accordingly, on May 23, 1997, this court asked the parties to file memoranda addressing the merits of the recusal claims and the overhanging question whether review by mandamus was warranted.  Del Valle complied;  defense counsel relied largely on the district judge's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 6, 1997, the district court issued an opinion and partial judgment disposing of the pending motions for summary judgment filed by the defendants.  The court dismissed certain claims and, as to others, scheduled an evidentiary hearing for later in June and a trial date in August 1997.  At the request of plaintiffs, this court then granted a stay of further proceedings in the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, there is no final judgment appealable as of right.  Ordinarily, a district judge's refusal to recuse is reviewable only on appeal of a final judgment;  the collateral order doctrine does not apply.  Nevertheless, in unusual situations, interim review of such a refusal is available through writ of mandamus.  See In re Cargill, Inc., 66 F.3d 1256, 1260 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1545, 134 L.Ed.2d 648 (1996) (collecting cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The usual first requirement for mandamus in a recusal matter is that the party seeking the writ show a \"clear and indisputable\" entitlement to relief.  In re United States, 666 F.2d 690, 695 (1st Cir.1981);  see 13A C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 3553, at 661 (2d ed.1984).  Interlocutory review, after all, interferes with the ordinary processes of trial and appeal;  and absent interlocutory review, many issues wash out along the way.  But over the years, appeals courts have held that given a clear error by the district judge in refusing to recuse, a stronger argument exists for immediate review by mandamus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mandamus is a discretionary writ and, even where the merits clearly favor the petitioner, relief may be withheld for lack of irreparable injury or based on a balance of equities.  These are malleable concepts and often matters of degree.  Some opinions suggest that a clear entitlement to recusal may itself warrant immediate relief, absent an equitable bar, because public confidence is enhanced where a clearly disqualified judge is removed swiftly.  See, e.g., In re United States, 666 F.2d at 694.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, in recusal cases, mandamus is almost always withheld--we do not say always--unless the petitioner demonstrates that it is \"clearly\" entitled to relief.  See Cargill, 66 F.3d at 1262.   Here, the plaintiffs have invoked two separate bases for disqualification, sections 144 and 455, whose procedural incidents differ widely.  We consider them separately and in order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 144.  This provision begins with a core one-sentence paragraph:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whenever a party to any proceeding in a district court makes and files a timely and sufficient affidavit that the judge before whom the matter is pending has a personal bias or prejudice either against him or in favor of any adverse party, such judge shall proceed no further therein, but another judge shall be assigned to hear such proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second paragraph sets forth a timeliness requirement (not here in dispute), provides that the party can only file one such affidavit in any case, and requires a certificate of counsel of record that the affidavit is made in good faith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 144 is unusual because it requires that the district judge accept the affidavit as true even though it may contain averments that are false and may be known to be so to the judge.  See United States v. Kelley, 712 F.2d 884, 889 (1st Cir.1983).  However, penalties for perjury and the certificate of counsel tend to discourage outright falsehood.  And the possibility remains, although not developed in the statute, that the transferee judge might hold a hearing, conclude that the affidavit was false and transfer the action back to the original judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, courts have responded to the draconian procedure--automatic transfer based solely on one side's affidavit--by insisting on a firm showing in the affidavit that the judge does have a personal bias or prejudice toward a party, and also by insisting on strict compliance with the procedural requirements of the section.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  And, while there are various bases at law for recusal, the only one governed by section 144 and subject to its procedural advantages for the recusing party are \"personal bias or prejudice.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with procedural issues.  Section 144's second paragraph requires the affidavit of \"a party\" setting forth \"the facts and the reasons for the belief that bias or prejudice exists\" and a separate \"certificate of counsel of record stating that it [the affidavit] is made in good faith.\"   Here, there was neither an affidavit of a party nor a certificate of counsel--only a single unsworn statement of counsel setting forth facts under penalty of perjury.  The papers are thus doubly defective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, an unsworn statement under penalty of perjury has the same effect as an affidavit.  28 U.S.C. &#167; 1746.  The missing certificate of counsel may also be redundant (although it still should have been supplied) where, as here, the motion and unsworn statement are both signed by counsel, making counsel subject to the good faith strictures of Fed.R.Civ.P. 11.  One might be more concerned about the lack of any affidavit or statement from \"a party,\" especially in view of the tradition of construing section 144 strictly in light of its drastic consequences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But probably the drafters of the statute expected that \"a party\" would possess the necessary knowledge showing (for example) personal hostility of the judge against that party.  In this case, plaintiffs' counsel was much closer than his clients to being a firsthand witness to the events.  It seems to us to satisfy the underlying purpose of the recusal statute to allow Del Valle to make the necessary filing rather than to insist that the plaintiffs themselves repeat the same facts on a hearsay basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starting with defense counsel's alleged inside knowledge of the judge's intentions, the problem is not one of ex parte contacts as such;  absent objection, separate discussions in the context of settlement agreements are common occurrences.  And, in pressing each side to take a reasonable view of its situation, judges often give the parties the court's impression of apparent strengths and weaknesses.  There are dangers in this practice, of course, but clients are often well served by settlements, and settlements often result from realistic appraisals of strengths and weaknesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather, the claim of bias or prejudice here rests primarily on the inference, drawn by plaintiffs' counsel, that the judge told defense counsel more or less definitively how the judge planned to rule on the summary judgment motions and on the implication that the judge gave no similar information to plaintiffs' counsel.  If so, this would obviously give one side a substantial advantage in negotiations.  We will assume arguendo that such an indiscretion could at least arguably be grounds for a reasonable inference of bias or prejudice toward someone (whether toward a party or counsel might require further information).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under section 144, recusal must be based upon the facts alleged in the affidavit, so we have to disregard the district judge's own later denial that he revealed how the motions were to be decided.  See Kelley, 712 F.2d at 889.   But, by the same token, automatic removal of the judge under that section requires averment of facts showing that the judge \"has\" a personal bias or prejudice, not that the judge might have such a bias or prejudice or that grounds exist for further inquiry.  As explained below, \"mights\" and further inquiries can always be pursued under section 455--where, however, the affidavit itself can be challenged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty with Del Valle's unsworn statement is that it does not show that the district judge revealed his intended disposition of any of the summary judgment motions to defense counsel.  The statement does not even say that defense counsel made such a claim.  Instead, the remarks attributed to defense counsel--the pertinent ones have been quoted in full above--show only that defense counsel sought to convey the impression that he knew how the judge would rule, while carefully refraining from explaining how he knew.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The unsworn statement itself shows that both plaintiffs' counsel and defense counsel had come from separate settlement conferences where (in common experience) judges often discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the claims.  There is nothing in the unsworn statement to indicate that defense counsel was doing more than making an intelligent prediction, perhaps puffing a bit to enhance his bargaining position.  This does not prove that the judge revealed to defense counsel how the judge intended to rule on the pending motions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn next to the judge's alleged statement that some of the plaintiffs were \"political sweet potatoes.\"   We understand this term to mean political hack, see Rodriguez-Garcia v. Davila, 904 F.2d 90, 100 n. 10 (1st Cir.1990), or as the district judge put it in another instance, \"people appointed to more or less useless jobs as political favors,\" see Rodriguez-Garcia v. Davila, No. 87-1411, 1988 WL 124046, * 2 (D.P.R. Nov. 9, 1988).  Under section 144, the question again is whether such a reference shows personal bias or prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming that the statement does show a predisposition, there is no evidence that the statement was improper.  A judge is ordinarily entitled to form a view of the parties that is favorable or unfavorable, so long as it derives from information in the case;  there may be exceptions but they are \"rare\" indeed.  See Liteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, 554, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 1156-57, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994).  Here, the district judge had before him the summary judgment filing in which the defendants challenged the bona fides of various plaintiffs.  There is no indication that the judge knew the individual plaintiffs from any context other than the current judicial proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judges constantly form personal opinions during proceedings.  It may be wiser not to express such views, and almost always prudent to avoid epithets, but disqualification is almost never required where the judge's opinions are based on the proceedings.  Inaccurate findings based on those opinions may lead to reversal on appeal but not to recusal.  Whether the words used by the district judge suggest a lack of impartiality is a different question, properly raised under the objective standard of section 455 and addressed below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is even less to the claim that the judge showed a personal bias or prejudice when he said, if he did say, that the plaintiffs should \"forget the Constitution.\"   However dramatic the phrase may sound in the abstract, in context it was here used as part of a perfectly permissible suggestion by the district judge, namely, that counsel ask his clients whether they were more interested in a monetary settlement than in an opportunity to express principle.  Judges say something of the sort in many settlement conferences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 455.  In its present version section 455 is the more modern and complete recusal statute and applies to all federal judges.  There is no threshold requirement of an affidavit or any other format for raising a recusal issue.  In fact, the judge is expected to recuse sua sponte, where necessary, even if no party has requested it.  Nor is there anything to prevent the party seeking recusal from trying to engage in discovery incident to a recusal motion, although the allowance of such discovery is within the sound discretion of the court.  See, e.g., Cheeves v. Southern Clays, Inc., 797 F.Supp. 1570, 1580 (M.D.Ga.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, under section 455, a judge is not compelled automatically to accept as true the allegations made by the party seeking recusal.  To the extent that facts are in dispute, factual determinations are made by the judge whose recusal is in question, and the same judge also decides whether the facts trigger disqualification, subject always to review on appeal, normally for abuse of discretion.  See, e.g., Town of Norfolk v. United States Army Corps of Engineers, 968 F.2d 1438, 1460 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It might seem odd that recusal issues should be decided by the very judge whose recusal is in question.  But there are other considerations at work, including a desire for expedition and a concern to discourage judge shopping.  In addition, one of the grounds for recusal under section 455 is the farreaching direction that the judge recuse himself or herself \"in any proceeding in which his [or her] impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\"  28 U.S.C. &#167; 455(a).  Thus, taken together, the provisions of section 455 tend to strike a reasonable balance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our case, the plaintiffs have invoked both section 455(a) and section 455(b)(1), which repeats the bias and prejudice language of section 144.  For present purposes, we focus on the impartiality language of section 455(a) because it covers the same ground and reaches even further.  Section 455(a) is in no way limited to \"personal\" bias or prejudice \"concerning a party\" and--unlike sections 144 and 455(b)(1)--does not require that bias or prejudice in fact be established.  United States v. Chantal, 902 F.2d 1018, 1023 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather, section 455(a) requires recusal wherever the objective circumstances create an appearance of partiality.  This does not mean that required recusal can be based on an \"unsupported, irrational, or highly tenuous speculation.\"  In re United States, 666 F.2d at 694.   It does mean that where the appearance of partiality exists, recusal is required regardless of the judge's own inner conviction that he or she can decide the case fairly despite the circumstances.  See Chantal, 902 F.2d at 1023.   See also Liteky, 510 U.S. at 548, 114 S.Ct. at 1153-54;  Blizard v. Frechette, 601 F.2d 1217, 1220 (1st Cir.1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With this gloss, we revisit plaintiffs' first and sharpest claim, namely, that the judge told the defense but not the plaintiffs how he planned to rule on the pending summary judgment motions.  As we have said, section 455, unlike section 144, is not limited to facts alleged in an affidavit.  But Del Valle's statement was itself insufficient to show that the judge made the alleged disclosure;  and the only additional pertinent fact beyond the statement is the judge's denial that he did so, hardly of help to the plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs now attack the judge's statement that he gave both sides a preliminary appraisal:  Del Valle now claims in his mandamus memorandum that in the settlement conference with the judge he was told virtually nothing even about likely outcomes.  But new assertions of fact by counsel in appellate briefs come too late, see Hurney v. Carver, 602 F.2d 993, 996 (1st Cir.1979);  Renovitch v. Kaufman, 905 F.2d 1040, 1049 n. 12 (7th Cir.1990), and plaintiffs have made no effort to prove what defense counsel was told.  Without knowing both, any comparison is hopeless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We return now, under the standard of section 455(a), to the district court's alleged remark that some of the plaintiffs were \"political sweet potatoes.\"   As already noted, a judge is normally free to develop views from the record as the case proceeds, and there is no showing here that the judge's assessment came from any other source.  Further, the judge's supposed comment--like his alleged admonition to \"forget the Constitution\"--was in context little more than a warning to plaintiffs' counsel, quite relevant to the settlement then being urged, that some of his clients might do better by compromise than at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two other assertions remain to be addressed.  In his unsworn statement, plaintiffs' counsel referred to the fact that one of the defense counsel had once clerked for the judge, an issue unrelated to party bias or prejudice but perhaps pertinent to appearance of partiality.  And on appeal, plaintiffs' counsel widens his claims slightly by saying that the district judge had once been actively connected with political causes opposed by the Popular Democratic Party.  Neither ground is expressly offered as an independent basis for recusal, and for good reason.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is common knowledge in the profession that former law clerks practice regularly before judges for whom they once clerked.  Courts often have prophylactic rules that forbid a former law clerk from appearing in that court for a year or more after the clerkship, see, e.g., 1st Cir.  R. 46, but no such rule is claimed to have been violated in this case.  And any lawyer who studies a judge's past rulings can make an informed guess as to how the judge is likely to approach an issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So, too, appointees to the bench have sometimes had a former active connection with a political party.  But many judges also sit, usually after a self-imposed cooling off period, on cases involving former clients (assuming always no current financial ties and that the judge did not work on the same or a related matter while in practice).  Former affiliations with a party may persuade a judge not to sit;  but they are rarely a basis for compelled recusal.  See, e.g., In re United States, 666 F.2d at 696;  Matter of Mason, 916 F.2d 384, 386 (7th Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All this being said, the whole is sometimes greater than the sum of the parts.  The cumulative effect of a judge's individual actions, comments and past associations could raise some question about impartiality, even though none (taken alone) would require recusal.  And, while the abuse of discretion standard is a forgiving one, perhaps in an extreme case the cumulative effect would warrant reversal on direct appeal if the judge refused to recuse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the primary condition of mandamus is that the petitioner be clearly entitled to relief.  Judges may choose to step aside in close cases;  the \"duty to sit\" concept has been modified by amended section 455.  See Blizard, 601 F.2d at 1220-21;  see also 13A Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper &#167; 3549, at 611.  But mandamus requires a case not merely close to the line but clearly over it;  and the line itself is especially blurred where no incident is sufficient and the claim is one of cumulative effects.  This case is certainly not so clearly over the line as to justify the shortcut of mandamus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When this case returns to the district court, section 144 will be out of the picture;  Del Valle's statement was insufficient on its face to show bias or prejudice, so it fails regardless of mandamus requirements, and only one such affidavit may be filed in an action.  The situation is otherwise under section 455(a);  our decision, resting as it does partly upon the mandamus standard, does not automatically prevent the further development of the record, nor an appeal after a final judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The possibility left open may carry some suggestion of reproof.  We therefore note that as yet no showing exists that the district judge gave any improper advantage in his disclosures to defense counsel, which is the closest that plaintiffs have come to a specific and serious charge.  Our only present stricture is that a district judge, however busy, ought not let a recusal motion alleging personal bias and prejudice sit dormant for eight months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petition for a writ of mandamus is denied.   The stay of proceedings in the district court is vacated.

The district judge denied the motion to recuse without an evidentiary hearing or any detailed submission by the opposing parties.  Thus, the raw facts set forth below, and assumed to be true for purposes of this opinion, are largely drawn from the petition for mandamus and related filings by petitioners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the 1992 municipal elections in Florida, Puerto Rico, the candidate for mayor of Florida affiliated with the New Progressive Party unseated the incumbent mayor who was affiliated with the Popular Democratic Party.  According to the complaint later filed by petitioners, who are plaintiffs in the district court, all 14 of them were dismissed or demoted in early January 1993.  Some of the plaintiffs had served as assistants to the mayor and others had been employees of Florida's elder community center.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The suit was brought as a civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983.

These cases limit, although they do not wholly eliminate, the ability of a new administration to dismiss or demote employees of the old administration on account of party affiliation.  Plaintiffs sought damages and reinstatement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1995, a motion for summary judgment was filed on behalf of defendants, who included the new mayor, the municipality and others.  The summary judgment motion urged that the former mayoral assistants had confidential positions that excepted them from the limit on political firings and also asserted that in other cases, the assistants had been hired illegally.  Defendants said that the former workers at the elder community center had been discharged due to lack of funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 13, 1996, in an effort to reach a settlement, the district judge met in chambers with counsel from both sides, with the defendant mayor, and with Florida's interim director of human resources.  Then the judge, apparently without objection, met separately with both sides.  Plaintiffs' counsel was Carlos Del Valle Cruz;  defense counsel included Jose Gaztambide, who at some earlier time had served as a law clerk to the district judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following their separate meetings with the judge, counsel for both sides met privately to discuss settlement.  Del Valle later filed an unsworn statement, made under penalty of perjury, describing his meeting with Gaztambide and with Luis Plaza, another defense attorney.  Crucial language from the unsworn statement follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>In said conference, they [the defense attorneys] made a settlement offer on the basis on (sic) of the Court's prospective ruling on their [defense] motion for summary judgment.  Counsel Gaztambide stated that the Court would be dismissing the case as to five (5) of the plaintiffs, was yet unsure of his decision as to three (3) of the plaintiffs, and would deny the motion for summary judgment as to the remaining six (6) plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense counsel then reviewed an earlier letter containing settlement offers for each plaintiff.  The statement continues:  \"Next to the name of each plaintiff, counsel Gaztambide made a downward slant for all those cases which the Court would be dismissing ... an upward slant next to the names of the cases the Court was yet unsure of ... and a circle next to the names of those cases [in which] the Court would deny the motion for summary judgment....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Del Valle objected that defense counsel had information about \"a prospective dismissal\" of certain of the cases.  All three lawyers returned to the judge who continued to urge settlement of the case.  When defense counsel Plaza said that Del Valle had an ethical obligation to report the settlement offers to his clients, Del Valle said that his clients were in court \"because they believed in the Constitution and their right to be made whole.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Del Valle's statement, the district judge then intervened \"to express that the undersigned should 'forget the Constitution,' because several of my clients were 'political sweet potatoes' that cared more about having some money in their pockets than about their Constitutional rights.\"   The judge then proposed a settlement figure of approximately $200,000 that \"counsel agreed to recommend to their clients.\"   Del Valle did meet with his clients, but the upshot was a motion by Del Valle, accompanied by the statement just described, requesting the district judge to recuse himself pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 144, 455(a) and (b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The motion for recusal was filed on June 17, 1996.  When no action had been taken on the motion after eight months, plaintiffs, on February 26, 1997, filed a motion requesting a ruling.  When again there was no response, plaintiffs on April 19, 1997, filed a petition for writ of mandamus in this court.  Ten days later, on April 29, 1997, the district court issued an opinion and order denying the motion for recusal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the 28-page opinion and order, the district court concluded that disqualification was not required under either section 144 or section 455.  The district judge stated that he had, \"as is customary, discussed separately with each party's counsel the perceived strengths and weaknesses of the case....\"  The opinion continued:  \"The undersigned did not tell either party definitively what his decision would be--he merely gave both parties his preliminary impression of the possibilities for success as to each claim.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This decision mooted plaintiffs' request to us for an order directing the district judge to rule.  But the mandamus petition also requested that this court order the district judge to recuse himself.  Accordingly, on May 23, 1997, this court asked the parties to file memoranda addressing the merits of the recusal claims and the overhanging question whether review by mandamus was warranted.  Del Valle complied;  defense counsel relied largely on the district judge's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 6, 1997, the district court issued an opinion and partial judgment disposing of the pending motions for summary judgment filed by the defendants.  The court dismissed certain claims and, as to others, scheduled an evidentiary hearing for later in June and a trial date in August 1997.  At the request of plaintiffs, this court then granted a stay of further proceedings in the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, there is no final judgment appealable as of right.  Ordinarily, a district judge's refusal to recuse is reviewable only on appeal of a final judgment;  the collateral order doctrine does not apply.  Nevertheless, in unusual situations, interim review of such a refusal is available through writ of mandamus.  See In re Cargill, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196338\"><a href=\"/opinion/196338/in-re-v-cargill-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1256</span></a></span>, 1260 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">648</span></span> (1996) (collecting cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The usual first requirement for mandamus in a recusal matter is that the party seeking the writ show a \"clear and indisputable\" entitlement to relief.  In re United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"398012\"><a href=\"/opinion/398012/in-re-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">666</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">690</span></a></span>, 695 (1st Cir.1981);  see 13A C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure &#167; 3553, at 661 (2d ed.1984).  Interlocutory review, after all, interferes with the ordinary processes of trial and appeal;  and absent interlocutory review, many issues wash out along the way.  But over the years, appeals courts have held that given a clear error by the district judge in refusing to recuse, a stronger argument exists for immediate review by mandamus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mandamus is a discretionary writ and, even where the merits clearly favor the petitioner, relief may be withheld for lack of irreparable injury or based on a balance of equities.  These are malleable concepts and often matters of degree.  Some opinions suggest that a clear entitlement to recusal may itself warrant immediate relief, absent an equitable bar, because public confidence is enhanced where a clearly disqualified judge is removed swiftly.  See, e.g., In re United States, 666 F.2d at 694.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, in recusal cases, mandamus is almost always withheld--we do not say always--unless the petitioner demonstrates that it is \"clearly\" entitled to relief.  See Cargill, 66 F.3d at 1262.   Here, the plaintiffs have invoked two separate bases for disqualification, sections 144 and 455, whose procedural incidents differ widely.  We consider them separately and in order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 144.  This provision begins with a core one-sentence paragraph:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whenever a party to any proceeding in a district court makes and files a timely and sufficient affidavit that the judge before whom the matter is pending has a personal bias or prejudice either against him or in favor of any adverse party, such judge shall proceed no further therein, but another judge shall be assigned to hear such proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second paragraph sets forth a timeliness requirement (not here in dispute), provides that the party can only file one such affidavit in any case, and requires a certificate of counsel of record that the affidavit is made in good faith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 144 is unusual because it requires that the district judge accept the affidavit as true even though it may contain averments that are false and may be known to be so to the judge.  See United States v. Kelley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"421829\"><a href=\"/opinion/421829/united-states-v-henry-francis-kelley/\"><span class=\"volume\">712</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">884</span></a></span>, 889 (1st Cir.1983).  However, penalties for perjury and the certificate of counsel tend to discourage outright falsehood.  And the possibility remains, although not developed in the statute, that the transferee judge might hold a hearing, conclude that the affidavit was false and transfer the action back to the original judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, courts have responded to the draconian procedure--automatic transfer based solely on one side's affidavit--by insisting on a firm showing in the affidavit that the judge does have a personal bias or prejudice toward a party, and also by insisting on strict compliance with the procedural requirements of the section.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  And, while there are various bases at law for recusal, the only one governed by section 144 and subject to its procedural advantages for the recusing party are \"personal bias or prejudice.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with procedural issues.  Section 144's second paragraph requires the affidavit of \"a party\" setting forth \"the facts and the reasons for the belief that bias or prejudice exists\" and a separate \"certificate of counsel of record stating that it [the affidavit] is made in good faith.\"   Here, there was neither an affidavit of a party nor a certificate of counsel--only a single unsworn statement of counsel setting forth facts under penalty of perjury.  The papers are thus doubly defective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, an unsworn statement under penalty of perjury has the same effect as an affidavit.  28 U.S.C. &#167; 1746.  The missing certificate of counsel may also be redundant (although it still should have been supplied) where, as here, the motion and unsworn statement are both signed by counsel, making counsel subject to the good faith strictures of Fed.R.Civ.P. 11.  One might be more concerned about the lack of any affidavit or statement from \"a party,\" especially in view of the tradition of construing section 144 strictly in light of its drastic consequences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But probably the drafters of the statute expected that \"a party\" would possess the necessary knowledge showing (for example) personal hostility of the judge against that party.  In this case, plaintiffs' counsel was much closer than his clients to being a firsthand witness to the events.  It seems to us to satisfy the underlying purpose of the recusal statute to allow Del Valle to make the necessary filing rather than to insist that the plaintiffs themselves repeat the same facts on a hearsay basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starting with defense counsel's alleged inside knowledge of the judge's intentions, the problem is not one of ex parte contacts as such;  absent objection, separate discussions in the context of settlement agreements are common occurrences.  And, in pressing each side to take a reasonable view of its situation, judges often give the parties the court's impression of apparent strengths and weaknesses.  There are dangers in this practice, of course, but clients are often well served by settlements, and settlements often result from realistic appraisals of strengths and weaknesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather, the claim of bias or prejudice here rests primarily on the inference, drawn by plaintiffs' counsel, that the judge told defense counsel more or less definitively how the judge planned to rule on the summary judgment motions and on the implication that the judge gave no similar information to plaintiffs' counsel.  If so, this would obviously give one side a substantial advantage in negotiations.  We will assume arguendo that such an indiscretion could at least arguably be grounds for a reasonable inference of bias or prejudice toward someone (whether toward a party or counsel might require further information).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under section 144, recusal must be based upon the facts alleged in the affidavit, so we have to disregard the district judge's own later denial that he revealed how the motions were to be decided.  See Kelley, 712 F.2d at 889.   But, by the same token, automatic removal of the judge under that section requires averment of facts showing that the judge \"has\" a personal bias or prejudice, not that the judge might have such a bias or prejudice or that grounds exist for further inquiry.  As explained below, \"mights\" and further inquiries can always be pursued under section 455--where, however, the affidavit itself can be challenged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty with Del Valle's unsworn statement is that it does not show that the district judge revealed his intended disposition of any of the summary judgment motions to defense counsel.  The statement does not even say that defense counsel made such a claim.  Instead, the remarks attributed to defense counsel--the pertinent ones have been quoted in full above--show only that defense counsel sought to convey the impression that he knew how the judge would rule, while carefully refraining from explaining how he knew.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The unsworn statement itself shows that both plaintiffs' counsel and defense counsel had come from separate settlement conferences where (in common experience) judges often discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the claims.  There is nothing in the unsworn statement to indicate that defense counsel was doing more than making an intelligent prediction, perhaps puffing a bit to enhance his bargaining position.  This does not prove that the judge revealed to defense counsel how the judge intended to rule on the pending motions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn next to the judge's alleged statement that some of the plaintiffs were \"political sweet potatoes.\"   We understand this term to mean political hack, see Rodriguez-Garcia v. Davila, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"542294\"><a href=\"/opinion/542294/edwin-rodriguez-garcia-v-esteban-davila-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">904</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span>, 100 n. 10 (1st Cir.1990), or as the district judge put it in another instance, \"people appointed to more or less useless jobs as political favors,\" see Rodriguez-Garcia v. Davila, No. 87-1411, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">124046</span></span>, * 2 (D.P.R. Nov. 9, 1988).  Under section 144, the question again is whether such a reference shows personal bias or prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming that the statement does show a predisposition, there is no evidence that the statement was improper.  A judge is ordinarily entitled to form a view of the parties that is favorable or unfavorable, so long as it derives from information in the case;  there may be exceptions but they are \"rare\" indeed.  See Liteky v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112935\"><a href=\"/opinion/112935/liteky-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">540</span></a></span>, 554, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112935\"><a href=\"/opinion/112935/liteky-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1147</span></a></span>, 1156-57, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112935\"><a href=\"/opinion/112935/liteky-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">474</span></a></span> (1994).  Here, the district judge had before him the summary judgment filing in which the defendants challenged the bona fides of various plaintiffs.  There is no indication that the judge knew the individual plaintiffs from any context other than the current judicial proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judges constantly form personal opinions during proceedings.  It may be wiser not to express such views, and almost always prudent to avoid epithets, but disqualification is almost never required where the judge's opinions are based on the proceedings.  Inaccurate findings based on those opinions may lead to reversal on appeal but not to recusal.  Whether the words used by the district judge suggest a lack of impartiality is a different question, properly raised under the objective standard of section 455 and addressed below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is even less to the claim that the judge showed a personal bias or prejudice when he said, if he did say, that the plaintiffs should \"forget the Constitution.\"   However dramatic the phrase may sound in the abstract, in context it was here used as part of a perfectly permissible suggestion by the district judge, namely, that counsel ask his clients whether they were more interested in a monetary settlement than in an opportunity to express principle.  Judges say something of the sort in many settlement conferences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 455.  In its present version section 455 is the more modern and complete recusal statute and applies to all federal judges.  There is no threshold requirement of an affidavit or any other format for raising a recusal issue.  In fact, the judge is expected to recuse sua sponte, where necessary, even if no party has requested it.  Nor is there anything to prevent the party seeking recusal from trying to engage in discovery incident to a recusal motion, although the allowance of such discovery is within the sound discretion of the court.  See, e.g., Cheeves v. Southern Clays, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">797</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1570</span></span>, 1580 (M.D.Ga.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, under section 455, a judge is not compelled automatically to accept as true the allegations made by the party seeking recusal.  To the extent that facts are in dispute, factual determinations are made by the judge whose recusal is in question, and the same judge also decides whether the facts trigger disqualification, subject always to review on appeal, normally for abuse of discretion.  See, e.g., Town of Norfolk v. United States Army Corps of Engineers, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"586821\"><a href=\"/opinion/586821/town-of-norfolk-and-town-of-walpole-v-united-states-army-corps-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">968</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1438</span></a></span>, 1460 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It might seem odd that recusal issues should be decided by the very judge whose recusal is in question.  But there are other considerations at work, including a desire for expedition and a concern to discourage judge shopping.  In addition, one of the grounds for recusal under section 455 is the farreaching direction that the judge recuse himself or herself \"in any proceeding in which his [or her] impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\"  28 U.S.C. &#167; 455(a).  Thus, taken together, the provisions of section 455 tend to strike a reasonable balance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our case, the plaintiffs have invoked both section 455(a) and section 455(b)(1), which repeats the bias and prejudice language of section 144.  For present purposes, we focus on the impartiality language of section 455(a) because it covers the same ground and reaches even further.  Section 455(a) is in no way limited to \"personal\" bias or prejudice \"concerning a party\" and--unlike sections 144 and 455(b)(1)--does not require that bias or prejudice in fact be established.  United States v. Chantal, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541061\"><a href=\"/opinion/541061/united-states-v-paul-frederic-chantal-iii/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1018</span></a></span>, 1023 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather, section 455(a) requires recusal wherever the objective circumstances create an appearance of partiality.  This does not mean that required recusal can be based on an \"unsupported, irrational, or highly tenuous speculation.\"  In re United States, 666 F.2d at 694.   It does mean that where the appearance of partiality exists, recusal is required regardless of the judge's own inner conviction that he or she can decide the case fairly despite the circumstances.  See Chantal, 902 F.2d at 1023.   See also Liteky, 510 U.S. at 548, 114 S.Ct. at 1153-54;  Blizard v. Frechette, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"368186\"><a href=\"/opinion/368186/20-fair-emplpraccas-102-20-empl-prac-dec-p-30043-margaret-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">601</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1217</span></a></span>, 1220 (1st Cir.1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With this gloss, we revisit plaintiffs' first and sharpest claim, namely, that the judge told the defense but not the plaintiffs how he planned to rule on the pending summary judgment motions.  As we have said, section 455, unlike section 144, is not limited to facts alleged in an affidavit.  But Del Valle's statement was itself insufficient to show that the judge made the alleged disclosure;  and the only additional pertinent fact beyond the statement is the judge's denial that he did so, hardly of help to the plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs now attack the judge's statement that he gave both sides a preliminary appraisal:  Del Valle now claims in his mandamus memorandum that in the settlement conference with the judge he was told virtually nothing even about likely outcomes.  But new assertions of fact by counsel in appellate briefs come too late, see Hurney v. Carver, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"368395\"><a href=\"/opinion/368395/john-hurney-v-norman-carver/\"><span class=\"volume\">602</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">993</span></a></span>, 996 (1st Cir.1979);  Renovitch v. Kaufman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543143\"><a href=\"/opinion/543143/fed-sec-l-rep-p-95313-paul-renovitch-barbara-renovitch-donald-k/\"><span class=\"volume\">905</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1040</span></a></span>, 1049 n. 12 (7th Cir.1990), and plaintiffs have made no effort to prove what defense counsel was told.  Without knowing both, any comparison is hopeless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We return now, under the standard of section 455(a), to the district court's alleged remark that some of the plaintiffs were \"political sweet potatoes.\"   As already noted, a judge is normally free to develop views from the record as the case proceeds, and there is no showing here that the judge's assessment came from any other source.  Further, the judge's supposed comment--like his alleged admonition to \"forget the Constitution\"--was in context little more than a warning to plaintiffs' counsel, quite relevant to the settlement then being urged, that some of his clients might do better by compromise than at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two other assertions remain to be addressed.  In his unsworn statement, plaintiffs' counsel referred to the fact that one of the defense counsel had once clerked for the judge, an issue unrelated to party bias or prejudice but perhaps pertinent to appearance of partiality.  And on appeal, plaintiffs' counsel widens his claims slightly by saying that the district judge had once been actively connected with political causes opposed by the Popular Democratic Party.  Neither ground is expressly offered as an independent basis for recusal, and for good reason.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is common knowledge in the profession that former law clerks practice regularly before judges for whom they once clerked.  Courts often have prophylactic rules that forbid a former law clerk from appearing in that court for a year or more after the clerkship, see, e.g., 1st Cir.  R. 46, but no such rule is claimed to have been violated in this case.  And any lawyer who studies a judge's past rulings can make an informed guess as to how the judge is likely to approach an issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So, too, appointees to the bench have sometimes had a former active connection with a political party.  But many judges also sit, usually after a self-imposed cooling off period, on cases involving former clients (assuming always no current financial ties and that the judge did not work on the same or a related matter while in practice).  Former affiliations with a party may persuade a judge not to sit;  but they are rarely a basis for compelled recusal.  See, e.g., In re United States, 666 F.2d at 696;  Matter of Mason, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"549800\"><a href=\"/opinion/549800/in-the-matter-of-bradford-mason/\"><span class=\"volume\">916</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">384</span></a></span>, 386 (7th Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All this being said, the whole is sometimes greater than the sum of the parts.  The cumulative effect of a judge's individual actions, comments and past associations could raise some question about impartiality, even though none (taken alone) would require recusal.  And, while the abuse of discretion standard is a forgiving one, perhaps in an extreme case the cumulative effect would warrant reversal on direct appeal if the judge refused to recuse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the primary condition of mandamus is that the petitioner be clearly entitled to relief.  Judges may choose to step aside in close cases;  the \"duty to sit\" concept has been modified by amended section 455.  See Blizard, 601 F.2d at 1220-21;  see also 13A Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper &#167; 3549, at 611.  But mandamus requires a case not merely close to the line but clearly over it;  and the line itself is especially blurred where no incident is sufficient and the claim is one of cumulative effects.  This case is certainly not so clearly over the line as to justify the shortcut of mandamus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When this case returns to the district court, section 144 will be out of the picture;  Del Valle's statement was insufficient on its face to show bias or prejudice, so it fails regardless of mandamus requirements, and only one such affidavit may be filed in an action.  The situation is otherwise under section 455(a);  our decision, resting as it does partly upon the mandamus standard, does not automatically prevent the further development of the record, nor an appeal after a final judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The possibility left open may carry some suggestion of reproof.  We therefore note that as yet no showing exists that the district judge gave any improper advantage in his disclosures to defense counsel, which is the closest that plaintiffs have come to a specific and serious charge.  Our only present stricture is that a district judge, however busy, ought not let a recusal motion alleging personal bias and prejudice sit dormant for eight months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petition for a writ of mandamus is denied.   The stay of proceedings in the district court is vacated.   Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> See, e.g., Glass v.
