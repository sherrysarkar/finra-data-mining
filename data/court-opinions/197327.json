Stephen  Michael Dion appeals  from a\r                                \r\n\nsentence  imposed upon  revocation  of a  term of  supervised\r\n\nrelease.   None of the  arguments Dion raises  on appeal were\r\n\npresented  to  the sentencing  court.    Having reviewed  the\r\n\nbriefs and record, we find no error (much less plain error).\r\n\n          First,  the imposition  of  an  additional term  of\r\n\nsupervised release was within the district court's authority.\r\n\nSee  United  States v.  O'Neil, 11  F.3d  292, 301  (1st Cir.\r                                          \r\n\n1993).

The two new special conditions of\r\n\nsupervised release  were clearly directed at  addressing this\r\n\nproblem.   Cf. United States v. Thurlow,  44 F.3d 46, 47 (1st\r                                                   \r\n\nCir.)
