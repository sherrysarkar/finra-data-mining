After  being denied  parole, he  sought a  writ of\r\n\nhabeas corpus, arguing  that the  Parole Commission  violated\r\n\nits  own  rules  and  that its  decision  was  arbitrary  and\r\n\ncapricious.  The district court denied relief.  We affirm. \r\n\n                              I\r                                          I\r\n\n          The  infamous Cerro  Maravilla incident  underlying\r\n\nthe criminal conviction of  Moreno-Morales, a police officer,\r\n\nhas been well described in other opinions.  See, e.g., United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates  v.

Moreno-Morales, 815  F.2d  725  (1st Cir.\r                                              \r\n\n1987); In re Grand Jury Investigations of the Cerro Maravilla\r                                                                         \r\n\nEvents, 783 F.2d  20 (1st Cir. 1986).   For present purposes,\r                  \r\n\nwe sketch the  facts pertinent to the decision  of the Parole\r\n\nCommission.\r\n\n          On  July  25,  1978,  members  of  the  \"Movimiento\r\n\nRevolucionario   Armado,\"   a  radical   Puerto   Rican  pro-\r\n\nindependence  movement,  attempted  to destroy  a  television\r\n\ntower at Cerro Maravilla.  The members included Arnaldo Dar o\r\n\nRosado, Carlos Soto Arriv , and  a third individual who was a\r\n\npolice informant.   The  Puerto Rico Police  learned of  this\r\n\nplanned  sabotage  through  the informant  and  ambushed  the\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\ngroup.    Appellant  Moreno-Morales   was  among  the  police\r\n\nofficers at the scene.  \r\n\n          After a  shoot-out,  Dar o Rosado  and Soto  Arriv \r\n\nsurrendered and were  taken into custody.   In custody, while\r\n\nhandcuffed, Dar o Rosado  and Soto Arriv  were  brutalized by\r\n\nthe police.   One police  officer killed Dar o Rosado  with a\r\n\nshotgun blast to the chest.  A second police officer shot and\r\n\nwounded Soto Arriv  with  a pistol.  Moreno-Morales took  the\r\n\npistol and shot Soto Arriv  again, killing him.\r\n\n          The police concealed their deeds by rearranging the\r\n\nscene to  make it seem  the two men  had not been  taken into\r\n\ncustody.  They fabricated a  story that Dar o Rosado and Soto\r\n\nArriv  had been killed in a shoot-out while resisting arrest.\r\n\nMoreno-Morales  and the  other officers  told  this story  to\r\n\nlocal district  attorneys investigating the shootings.   When\r\n\nthe  victims' survivors brought a civil rights action against\r\n\nthe  Commonwealth  of  Puerto  Rico  in  federal  court,  the\r\n\nofficers told the same  story in deposition testimony.   They\r\n\nalso  told this story  to a federal  grand jury investigating\r\n\nthe event.  \r\n\n          In February 1984, after  prolonged investigation, a\r\n\nfederal  grand  jury  returned  indictments  against  Moreno-\r\n\nMorales  and  he  was convicted  after  trial  of obstructing\r\n\njustice,  giving  false  testimony,  suborning  perjury,  and\r\n\ncommitting perjury.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          In January  1985, Moreno-Morales was  charged under\r\n\nPuerto Rico  law with murder  for the deaths of  Dar o Rosado\r\n\nand Soto  Arriv .   Moreno-Morales was  convicted of  second-\r\n\ndegree murder as to the death of Soto Arriv  and sentenced to\r\n\ntwenty-two  to  thirty  years  in  jail.    That sentence  is\r\n\nconsecutive to his federal sentence.\r\n\n                              II\r                                          II\r\n\n          Moreno-Morales    was    eligible     for    parole\r\n\nconsideration on March 27, 1995.   Under 18 U.S.C.   4208(a),\r\n\nan initial parole  hearing is to be held,  when feasible, not\r\n\nlater than thirty days prior  to the parole eligibility date.\r\n\nThe Parole Commission  delayed the hearing beyond  the thirty\r\n\ndays until  it obtained  additional information.   By  letter\r\n\ndated March  8, 1995, the  Parole Commission asked  the Chief\r\n\nProbation  Officer for  the District  of Puerto  Rico  for an\r\n\nexplanation  of  Moreno-Morales's  involvement in  the  Cerro\r\n\nMaravilla killings.  The letter explained that the Commission\r\n\nneeded \"further information  . . . to conduct  the hearing in\r\n\nconformity  with  the  Commission procedures.\"      The Chief\r\n\nProbation Officer  referred the  matter to  attorneys at  the\r\n\nCriminal Section  of the Civil Rights Division  of the United\r\n\nStates Department of Justice.   On June 30, 1995, an attorney\r\n\nfrom  the Justice  Department  wrote a  letter to  the Parole\r\n\nCommission explaining Moreno-Morales's role  in the killings.\r\n\nMoreno-Morales was not copied on the letter.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n          The  Parole  Commission  scheduled Moreno-Morales's\r\n\nhearing for July 20,  1995.  On July 17, 1995, the Commission\r\n\nsent a copy of the Justice Department letter to the Bureau of\r\n\nPrisons with instructions  to disclose the letter  to Moreno-\r\n\nMorales  but not to furnish a copy of  it to him.  The Bureau\r\n\nof Prisons did this on July 18, 1995.  \r\n\n          On July 20, the hearing occurred before one hearing\r\n\nexaminer, as  permitted by  Commission regulations.   See  28\r                                                                     \r\n\nC.F.R.   2.13(a).   At the  hearing, Moreno-Morales  admitted\r\n\nshooting Soto Arriv , saying he did so when he \"lost control\"\r\n\nafter Soto  Arriv  shot at  him.  Moreno-Morales  also argued\r\n\nthat some witnesses had been  paid by the government to alter\r\n\ntheir testimony.  The hearing examiner instructed that a copy\r\n\nof  the Justice  Department  letter  should  be  provided  to\r\n\nMoreno-Morales.\r\n\n          On August 9, 1995, the Commission issued its Notice\r\n\nof Action denying parole.  The Notice stated:\r\n\n          Your offense behavior has been rated as a\r\n          Category   Eight   severity   because  it\r\n          involved  murder.   Your  salient  factor\r\n          score (SFS-81) is  10.  You have  been in\r\n          federal confinement  as a result  of your\r\n          behavior  for  a  total  of  124  months.\r\n          Guidelines established by  the Commission\r\n          indicate  a range  of  100+ months  to be\r\n          served before release for cases with good\r\n          institutional   adjustment   and  program\r\n          achievement.     After   review  of   all\r\n          relevant    factors    and    information\r\n          presented a decision more  than 48 months\r\n          above  the  minimum   guidelines  appears\r\n          warranted because  your offense  behavior\r\n          involved   the   following    aggravating\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n          factors:   An unarmed person  detained by\r\n          police  and   handcuffed  was   shot  and\r\n          killed.\r\n\nAlthough the Notice was issued  on August 9, 1995, the Bureau\r\n\nof Prisons did not deliver the Notice to Moreno-Morales until\r\n\nDecember 8, 1995.  \r\n\n          On December 15,  1995, Moreno-Morales appealed  the\r\n\ndecision  to the  National Appeals  Board,  arguing that  the\r\n\nCommission  did not follow correct procedures in deciding his\r\n\ncase   and  that  the  Commission  should  have  granted  him\r\n\nleniency.  On March 13,  1996, the Board affirmed the hearing\r\n\nexaminer's  decision.   The  Board rejected  Moreno-Morales's\r\n\narguments:\r\n\n          You were  not prejudiced by the fact that\r\n          your initial hearing was held four months\r\n          after  your  completion of  your  minimum\r\n          term.       The   Commission's    current\r\n          regulations   state   that   \"an  initial\r\n          hearing shall  be conducted  by a  single\r\n          hearing  examiner  unless   the  Regional\r\n          Commissioner orders  that the  hearing be\r\n          conducted by  a panel of  two examiners.\"\r\n          28  C.F.R.    2.13(A).   Therefore, there\r\n          was  no error in  the fact that  only one\r\n          examiner  conducted your  hearing.   Your\r\n          notice  of action was issued on August 9,\r\n          1995, within 21 days after  your July 20,\r\n          1995 hearing, as  required by regulation.\r\n          The  fact that the  Bureau of Prisons may\r\n          not have immediately delivered the NOA to\r\n          you is not the fault of the Commission.\r\n\nThe Board  also  rejected  Moreno-Morales's  claim  that  the\r\n\nCommission  did not  disclose the  Justice  Department letter\r\n\nprior to  the hearing by pointing  out that, in fact,  he had\r\n\nbeen shown  the letter.  Finally, the  Board rejected Moreno-\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nMorales's claim  that he  should have  been granted  leniency\r\n\nbecause a co-defendant had been  granted leniency.  The Board\r\n\nstated there  were  significant mitigating  factors  in  that\r\n\ncase,  and leniency  granted  in one  case  does not  require\r\n\nleniency in another.\r\n\n          On  May  16,  1996, Moreno-Morales  filed  a habeas\r\n\ncorpus petition, again arguing that the Parole Commission had\r\n\nacted  capriciously and  that  it had  failed  to follow  its\r\n\ninternal regulations.  The district court denied the petition\r\n\nwithout a hearing.  Moreno-Morales appeals.\r\n\n                             III\r                                         III\r\n\n          While  there is  some debate  among  the courts  of\r\n\nappeal as  to the scope  and standard of review  of different\r\n\ntypes of  Parole Commission decisions,1 for  present purposes\r\n\nwe will  assume this decision  is reviewable and test  it for\r\n\nwhether  it  is  irrational, arbitrary  or  capricious.   The\r\n\ndecision is plainly none of these things.\r\n\n          Under  the Parole  Commission's guidelines,  parole\r\n\ndeterminations  are based upon two factors:  offense category\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  For  cases holding decisions of the Parole Commission are\r\nnot reviewable for abuse of  discretion, see, e.g., Jones  v.\r                                                                     \r\nUnited  States Bureau  of Prisons, 903  F.2d 1178,  1183 (8th\r                                             \r\nCir. 1990);  Wallace v.

See id. \r                                                                        \r\n\nAs to  the second prong,  the Commission assigned  to Moreno-\r\n\nMorales a  salient factor  score of  ten, the most  favorable\r\n\nrating.   \r\n\n          There are eight offense  categories, and the parole\r\n\nguidelines  provide  upper and  lower confinement  limits for\r\n\ncategories one through  seven, from which the  Commission may\r\n\ndepart for good cause.  See 18 U.S.C.   4206(c).  There is no\r                                       \r\n\nupper  limit for  category  eight  offenses  because  of  the\r\n\n\"extreme variability of the cases  within this category.\"  28\r\n\nC.F.R.   2.20 n.1.   If the Commission decides to exceed  the\r\n\nlower limit of category eight parole eligibility by more than\r\n\nforty-eight  months,  it  must  \"specify the  pertinent  case\r\n\nfactors upon which it relied  in reaching its decision.\"  Id.\r                                                                         \r\n\n          The base  offense category  for  perjury is  three,\r\n\nexcept when the perjury concerns a criminal offense, in which\r\n\ncase  the  offense  category  is  two  categories  below  the\r\n\nunderlying offense.  Because Moreno-Morales committed perjury\r\n\nwhile attempting  to conceal  a murder,  an offense  category\r\n\neight  crime, his offense  category would ordinarily  be six.\r\n\nSee 28 C.F.R.    2.20 ch.6.  The  Parole Commission, however,\r               \r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nelevated Moreno-Morales's  offense category to  eight because\r\n\nof the fact  he had committed murder.   The Parole Commission\r\n\nmay  take into account  any substantial information available\r\n\nto it  when assessing the  offense category, see 28  C.F.R.  \r                                                            \r\n\n2.19(c), and this decision was entirely rational in  light of\r\n\nthe conviction,  the Justice  Department letter, and  Moreno-\r\n\nMorales's own admissions.  \r\n\n          Under the guidelines, the Commission was  obligated\r\n\nto state the reasons for its decision to deny parole.  See 28\r                                                                      \r\n\nC.F.R.    2.20  n.1.   The Commission  did this,  stating the\r\n\ndecision  was premised upon  the aggravating factor  that \"an\r\n\nunarmed person detained by police and handcuffed was shot and\r\n\nkilled.\"  That is enough.\r\n\n                              IV\r                                          IV\r\n\n          Moreno-Morales's  arguments  that   the  Commission\r\n\nfailed  to  follow  its  own rules  are  also  without merit.\r\n\nMoreno-Morales  argues that the  Parole Commission denied him\r\n\n\"reasonable  access\" to the  Justice Department letter  and a\r\n\nmeaningful  opportunity to respond to it.  Moreno-Morales saw\r\n\nthe  letter two  days before  his  hearing, a  fact which  he\r\n\nadmits,  and  he  declined the  hearing  examiner's  offer to\r\n\ncontinue  the hearing  until a  later date  -- an  offer made\r\n\nspecifically  to  give  Moreno-Morales  the  opportunity   to\r\n\nconsider his response.  Moreno-Morales complains he could not\r\n\nfully  explain his version  of events because  his translator\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nwas not fluent in  Spanish, but does  not explain how he  was\r\n\nprejudiced on this  account.  See Sacasas v.  Rison, 755 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n1533, 1535 (11th  Cir. 1985) (petitioner must  demonstrate he\r\n\nwas prejudiced by Parole Commission's  acts to be entitled to\r\n\nhabeas  relief).  In any event,  the hearing examiner plainly\r\n\nunderstood at  least the gist of Moreno-Morales's assertions,\r\n\nas he refers to them in his Initial Hearing Summary.  \r\n\n          Moreno-Morales   also   argues  that   the   Parole\r\n\nCommission failed to  state the reasons  for its denial  with\r\n\nparticularity as  required by 18  U.S.C.   4206(b).   This is\r\n\nplainly  incorrect,  as  the  Notice  of  Action specifically\r\n\nexplained that  parole was  denied because  \"an armed  person\r\n\ndetained by police and handcuffed was shot and killed.\"\r\n\n        We affirm the decision of the district court.2\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  At oral  argument, the  government informed  us that  the\r\nParole Commission conducted another hearing regarding Moreno-\r\nMorales in October  1997 and has yet to  render its decision.\r\nNothing  in this decision should  be construed to prevent the\r\nParole  Commission from  reaching its  own  decision in  that\r\nmatter.\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n",

For present purposes,\r                  \r\n\nwe sketch the  facts pertinent to the decision  of the Parole\r\n\nCommission.\r\n\n          On  July  25,  1978,  members  of  the  \"Movimiento\r\n\nRevolucionario   Armado,\"   a  radical   Puerto   Rican  pro-\r\n\nindependence  movement,  attempted  to destroy  a  television\r\n\ntower at Cerro Maravilla.  The members included Arnaldo Dar o\r\n\nRosado, Carlos Soto Arriv , and  a third individual who was a\r\n\npolice informant.   The  Puerto Rico Police  learned of  this\r\n\nplanned  sabotage  through  the informant  and  ambushed  the\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\ngroup.    Appellant  Moreno-Morales   was  among  the  police\r\n\nofficers at the scene.  \r\n\n          After a  shoot-out,  Dar o Rosado  and Soto  Arriv \r\n\nsurrendered and were  taken into custody.   In custody, while\r\n\nhandcuffed, Dar o Rosado  and Soto Arriv  were  brutalized by\r\n\nthe police.   One police  officer killed Dar o Rosado  with a\r\n\nshotgun blast to the chest.  A second police officer shot and\r\n\nwounded Soto Arriv  with  a pistol.  Moreno-Morales took  the\r\n\npistol and shot Soto Arriv  again, killing him.\r\n\n          The police concealed their deeds by rearranging the\r\n\nscene to  make it seem  the two men  had not been  taken into\r\n\ncustody.  They fabricated a  story that Dar o Rosado and Soto\r\n\nArriv  had been killed in a shoot-out while resisting arrest.\r\n\nMoreno-Morales  and the  other officers  told  this story  to\r\n\nlocal district  attorneys investigating the shootings.   When\r\n\nthe  victims' survivors brought a civil rights action against\r\n\nthe  Commonwealth  of  Puerto  Rico  in  federal  court,  the\r\n\nofficers told the same  story in deposition testimony.   They\r\n\nalso  told this story  to a federal  grand jury investigating\r\n\nthe event.  \r\n\n          In February 1984, after  prolonged investigation, a\r\n\nfederal  grand  jury  returned  indictments  against  Moreno-\r\n\nMorales  and  he  was convicted  after  trial  of obstructing\r\n\njustice,  giving  false  testimony,  suborning  perjury,  and\r\n\ncommitting perjury.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          In January  1985, Moreno-Morales was  charged under\r\n\nPuerto Rico  law with murder  for the deaths of  Dar o Rosado\r\n\nand Soto  Arriv .   Moreno-Morales was  convicted of  second-\r\n\ndegree murder as to the death of Soto Arriv  and sentenced to\r\n\ntwenty-two  to  thirty  years  in  jail.    That sentence  is\r\n\nconsecutive to his federal sentence.\r\n\n                              II\r                                          II\r\n\n          Moreno-Morales    was    eligible     for    parole\r\n\nconsideration on March 27, 1995.   Under 18 U.S.C.   4208(a),\r\n\nan initial parole  hearing is to be held,  when feasible, not\r\n\nlater than thirty days prior  to the parole eligibility date.\r\n\nThe Parole Commission  delayed the hearing beyond  the thirty\r\n\ndays until  it obtained  additional information.   By  letter\r\n\ndated March  8, 1995, the  Parole Commission asked  the Chief\r\n\nProbation  Officer for  the District  of Puerto  Rico  for an\r\n\nexplanation  of  Moreno-Morales's  involvement in  the  Cerro\r\n\nMaravilla killings.  The letter explained that the Commission\r\n\nneeded \"further information  . . . to conduct  the hearing in\r\n\nconformity  with  the  Commission procedures.\"      The Chief\r\n\nProbation Officer  referred the  matter to  attorneys at  the\r\n\nCriminal Section  of the Civil Rights Division  of the United\r\n\nStates Department of Justice.   On June 30, 1995, an attorney\r\n\nfrom  the Justice  Department  wrote a  letter to  the Parole\r\n\nCommission explaining Moreno-Morales's role  in the killings.\r\n\nMoreno-Morales was not copied on the letter.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n          The  Parole  Commission  scheduled Moreno-Morales's\r\n\nhearing for July 20,  1995.  On July 17, 1995, the Commission\r\n\nsent a copy of the Justice Department letter to the Bureau of\r\n\nPrisons with instructions  to disclose the letter  to Moreno-\r\n\nMorales  but not to furnish a copy of  it to him.  The Bureau\r\n\nof Prisons did this on July 18, 1995.  \r\n\n          On July 20, the hearing occurred before one hearing\r\n\nexaminer, as  permitted by  Commission regulations.   See  28\r                                                                     \r\n\nC.F.R.   2.13(a).   At the  hearing, Moreno-Morales  admitted\r\n\nshooting Soto Arriv , saying he did so when he \"lost control\"\r\n\nafter Soto  Arriv  shot at  him.  Moreno-Morales  also argued\r\n\nthat some witnesses had been  paid by the government to alter\r\n\ntheir testimony.  The hearing examiner instructed that a copy\r\n\nof  the Justice  Department  letter  should  be  provided  to\r\n\nMoreno-Morales.\r\n\n          On August 9, 1995, the Commission issued its Notice\r\n\nof Action denying parole.  The Notice stated:\r\n\n          Your offense behavior has been rated as a\r\n          Category   Eight   severity   because  it\r\n          involved  murder.   Your  salient  factor\r\n          score (SFS-81) is  10.  You have  been in\r\n          federal confinement  as a result  of your\r\n          behavior  for  a  total  of  124  months.\r\n          Guidelines established by  the Commission\r\n          indicate  a range  of  100+ months  to be\r\n          served before release for cases with good\r\n          institutional   adjustment   and  program\r\n          achievement.     After   review  of   all\r\n          relevant    factors    and    information\r\n          presented a decision more  than 48 months\r\n          above  the  minimum   guidelines  appears\r\n          warranted because  your offense  behavior\r\n          involved   the   following    aggravating\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n          factors:   An unarmed person  detained by\r\n          police  and   handcuffed  was   shot  and\r\n          killed.\r\n\nAlthough the Notice was issued  on August 9, 1995, the Bureau\r\n\nof Prisons did not deliver the Notice to Moreno-Morales until\r\n\nDecember 8, 1995.  \r\n\n          On December 15,  1995, Moreno-Morales appealed  the\r\n\ndecision  to the  National Appeals  Board,  arguing that  the\r\n\nCommission  did not follow correct procedures in deciding his\r\n\ncase   and  that  the  Commission  should  have  granted  him\r\n\nleniency.  On March 13,  1996, the Board affirmed the hearing\r\n\nexaminer's  decision.   The  Board rejected  Moreno-Morales's\r\n\narguments:\r\n\n          You were  not prejudiced by the fact that\r\n          your initial hearing was held four months\r\n          after  your  completion of  your  minimum\r\n          term.       The   Commission's    current\r\n          regulations   state   that   \"an  initial\r\n          hearing shall  be conducted  by a  single\r\n          hearing  examiner  unless   the  Regional\r\n          Commissioner orders  that the  hearing be\r\n          conducted by  a panel of  two examiners.\"\r\n          28  C.F.R.    2.13(A).   Therefore, there\r\n          was  no error in  the fact that  only one\r\n          examiner  conducted your  hearing.   Your\r\n          notice  of action was issued on August 9,\r\n          1995, within 21 days after  your July 20,\r\n          1995 hearing, as  required by regulation.\r\n          The  fact that the  Bureau of Prisons may\r\n          not have immediately delivered the NOA to\r\n          you is not the fault of the Commission.\r\n\nThe Board  also  rejected  Moreno-Morales's  claim  that  the\r\n\nCommission  did not  disclose the  Justice  Department letter\r\n\nprior to  the hearing by pointing  out that, in fact,  he had\r\n\nbeen shown  the letter.  Finally, the  Board rejected Moreno-\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nMorales's claim  that he  should have  been granted  leniency\r\n\nbecause a co-defendant had been  granted leniency.  The Board\r\n\nstated there  were  significant mitigating  factors  in  that\r\n\ncase,  and leniency  granted  in one  case  does not  require\r\n\nleniency in another.\r\n\n          On  May  16,  1996, Moreno-Morales  filed  a habeas\r\n\ncorpus petition, again arguing that the Parole Commission had\r\n\nacted  capriciously and  that  it had  failed  to follow  its\r\n\ninternal regulations.  The district court denied the petition\r\n\nwithout a hearing.  Moreno-Morales appeals.\r\n\n                             III\r                                         III\r\n\n          While  there is  some debate  among  the courts  of\r\n\nappeal as  to the scope  and standard of review  of different\r\n\ntypes of  Parole Commission decisions,1 for  present purposes\r\n\nwe will  assume this decision  is reviewable and test  it for\r\n\nwhether  it  is  irrational, arbitrary  or  capricious.   The\r\n\ndecision is plainly none of these things.\r\n\n          Under  the Parole  Commission's guidelines,  parole\r\n\ndeterminations  are based upon two factors:  offense category\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.

See 28 C.F.R.   2.20.  The offense\r                                          \r\n\ncategory rates  the severity  of the  inmate's offense.   The\r\n\nsalient factor  score  rates the  inmate's  parole  prognosis\r\n\nbased on  such factors as criminal record and  age.  See id. \r                                                                        \r\n\nAs to  the second prong,  the Commission assigned  to Moreno-\r\n\nMorales a  salient factor  score of  ten, the most  favorable\r\n\nrating.   \r\n\n          There are eight offense  categories, and the parole\r\n\nguidelines  provide  upper and  lower confinement  limits for\r\n\ncategories one through  seven, from which the  Commission may\r\n\ndepart for good cause.  See 18 U.S.C.   4206(c).  There is no\r                                       \r\n\nupper  limit for  category  eight  offenses  because  of  the\r\n\n\"extreme variability of the cases  within this category.\"  28\r\n\nC.F.R.   2.20 n.1.   If the Commission decides to exceed  the\r\n\nlower limit of category eight parole eligibility by more than\r\n\nforty-eight  months,  it  must  \"specify the  pertinent  case\r\n\nfactors upon which it relied  in reaching its decision.\"  Id.\r                                                                         \r\n\n          The base  offense category  for  perjury is  three,\r\n\nexcept when the perjury concerns a criminal offense, in which\r\n\ncase  the  offense  category  is  two  categories  below  the\r\n\nunderlying offense.  Because Moreno-Morales committed perjury\r\n\nwhile attempting  to conceal  a murder,  an offense  category\r\n\neight  crime, his offense  category would ordinarily  be six.\r\n\nSee 28 C.F.R.    2.20 ch.6.  The  Parole Commission, however,\r               \r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nelevated Moreno-Morales's  offense category to  eight because\r\n\nof the fact  he had committed murder.   The Parole Commission\r\n\nmay  take into account  any substantial information available\r\n\nto it  when assessing the  offense category, see 28  C.F.R.  \r                                                            \r\n\n2.19(c), and this decision was entirely rational in  light of\r\n\nthe conviction,  the Justice  Department letter, and  Moreno-\r\n\nMorales's own admissions.  \r\n\n          Under the guidelines, the Commission was  obligated\r\n\nto state the reasons for its decision to deny parole.  See 28\r                                                                      \r\n\nC.F.R.    2.20  n.1.   The Commission  did this,  stating the\r\n\ndecision  was premised upon  the aggravating factor  that \"an\r\n\nunarmed person detained by police and handcuffed was shot and\r\n\nkilled.\"  That is enough.\r\n\n                              IV\r                                          IV\r\n\n          Moreno-Morales's  arguments  that   the  Commission\r\n\nfailed  to  follow  its  own rules  are  also  without merit.\r\n\nMoreno-Morales  argues that the  Parole Commission denied him\r\n\n\"reasonable  access\" to the  Justice Department letter  and a\r\n\nmeaningful  opportunity to respond to it.  Moreno-Morales saw\r\n\nthe  letter two  days before  his  hearing, a  fact which  he\r\n\nadmits,  and  he  declined the  hearing  examiner's  offer to\r\n\ncontinue  the hearing  until a  later date  -- an  offer made\r\n\nspecifically  to  give  Moreno-Morales  the  opportunity   to\r\n\nconsider his response.  Moreno-Morales complains he could not\r\n\nfully  explain his version  of events because  his translator\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nwas not fluent in  Spanish, but does  not explain how he  was\r\n\nprejudiced on this  account.

In any event,  the hearing examiner plainly\r\n\nunderstood at  least the gist of Moreno-Morales's assertions,\r\n\nas he refers to them in his Initial Hearing Summary.  \r\n\n          Moreno-Morales   also   argues  that   the   Parole\r\n\nCommission failed to  state the reasons  for its denial  with\r\n\nparticularity as  required by 18  U.S.C.   4206(b).   This is\r\n\nplainly  incorrect,  as  the  Notice  of  Action specifically\r\n\nexplained that  parole was  denied because  \"an armed  person\r\n\ndetained by police and handcuffed was shot and killed.\"\r\n\n        We affirm the decision of the district court.2\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  At oral  argument, the  government informed  us that  the\r\nParole Commission conducted another hearing regarding Moreno-\r\nMorales in October  1997 and has yet to  render its decision.\r\nNothing  in this decision should  be construed to prevent the\r\nParole  Commission from  reaching its  own  decision in  that\r\nmatter.\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n</pre>",
