William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                 Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n           Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n Alfred Almeder on brief pro se.\r\n\nJune 1, 1998\r\n\n                                           Per Curiam.  Alfred Almeder filed a notice of appeal\r\nseeking review of the district court's denial of his motion to\r\nvacate a default and his motion to reconsider that denial.  His\r\nfailure to procure a transcript of the hearing held on June 6,\r\n1997, at which, it appears, the district court explained its\r\nreasons for the denial of these two motions, however, precludes\r\na reasoned review of that determination.  See Fed. R. App.\r\n10(b) (outlining the appellant's duty); see also Moore v.\r\nMurphy, 47 F.3d 8, 10-11 (1st Cir. 1995) (reciting the\r\nconsequences of appellant's failure to procure a necessary\r\ntranscript).\r\n          From aught that appears in the limited record\r\nprovided by appellant, we could find no abuse of discretion in\r\nthe court's rulings.  In particular, Almeder's claim that he\r\n\"never received a request to file a response to any\r\nallegations\" is simply refuted by the record.  The summons,\r\nitself, which Almeder acknowledges that he received, along with\r\na copy of the complaint, stated that he was\r\n          required to serve upon Plaintiff's\r\n          Attorney [] an answer to the complaint\r\n          which is herewith served upon you, within\r\n          twenty days after service of this summons\r\n          upon you, exclusive of the day of service. \r\n          If you fail to do so, judgment by default\r\n          will be taken against you for the relief\r\n          demanded in the complaint.  You must also\r\n          file your answer with the Clerk of this\r\n          Court within a reasonable period of time\r\n          after service.\r\n\n          Therefore, we affirm the order of the district court\r\ndenying Almeder's motion for reconsideration of the denial of\r\nhis motion to vacate the default.\r\n          Affirmed.  Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
