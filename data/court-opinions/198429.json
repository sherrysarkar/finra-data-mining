FORD,\r\n\n                      Appellant.\r\n\nAPPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \r\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\r\n[Hon. D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                        Before\r\n\n                Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n          Boudin and Stahl, Circuit Judges.\r\n\nRichard N. Foley for appellant.\r\nMargaret D. McGaughey, Assistant United States Attorney, with\r\nwhom Jay P. McCloskey, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\r\nappellee.\r\n\nApril 14, 1999\r\n\nPer Curiam.  Defendant Edward Ford appeals the revocation\r\nof his supervised release on two grounds.  First, he challenges the\r\nmagistrate's denial of his motion to subpoena several witnesses. \r\nSecond, he argues, for the first time on appeal, that he did not\r\nreceive effective assistance of counsel.  We affirm.\r\nIn 1993, Ford pleaded guilty to credit card fraud charges\r\nand was sentenced to a prison term followed by thirty-three months\r\nof supervised release.  The supervised release was conditioned on\r\nseveral things, including, inter alia, not committing new crimes\r\nand informing his supervisor of address changes.  In 1998, claiming\r\nthat Ford violated various terms of the release, Ford's probation\r\nofficer petitioned the court to revoke Ford's supervised release. \r\nThe magistrate issued a warrant for Ford based on the officer's\r\ncharges.\r\nFord's attorney filed an ex parte motion to issue and\r\nserve subpoenas on thirteen people.  The motion stated only that\r\nthe witnesses \"may testify that some of Defendant's alleged\r\nviolations are only civil in nature and not criminal.\"  The motion\r\ndid not supply street addresses for most of the witnesses, and\r\nneglected to even supply the cities or states for four of the\r\nwitnesses.  The magistrate denied the motion, and Ford did not\r\nraise this issue in the district court.  After a revocation\r\nhearing, the district court entered an order revoking the\r\nsupervised release and imposing a new sentence.\r\nOn appeal, Ford argues that the magistrate abused his\r\ndiscretion in refusing to issue the subpoenas.  We do not, however,\r\nhave jurisdiction to hear an appeal of the magistrate's order.  See28 U.S.C.  1291 (giving the courts of appeals jurisdiction over\r\nappeals \"from all final decisions of the district courts of the\r\nUnited States\") (emphasis added); United States v. Ecker, 923 F.2d\r\n7, 8 (1st Cir. 1991) (per curiam) (\"[A] magistrate's order is not\r\na 'final' order which can be reviewed directly by a court of\r\nappeals.\").   Ford attempts to distinguish an ex parte motion for\r\nsubpoenas from the usual types of pre-trial motions before a\r\nmagistrate.  We have stated, however, that we are not authorized to\r\nreview any magistrate orders.  See id. at 9.  Indeed, this court\r\nhas rejected a similar argument that a magistrate's commitment\r\norder was an \"anomalous\" order that qualified for immediate review\r\nin the circuit court.  See id.  (\"[N]othing in the Magistrates Act\r\npermits [defendant] to bypass the first level of review simply\r\nbecause commitment decisions may qualify as 'collateral orders.'\"). \r\nTherefore, we need not reach the merits of Ford's argument.\r\nFord also argues, for the first time on appeal, that he\r\nwas denied his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of\r\ncounsel, suggesting that his trial attorney was deficient in the\r\nmanner in which he sought the subpoenas.  We do not ordinarily\r\naccept ineffective assistance of counsel claims for the first time\r\non appeal.  See United States v. Martinez-Martinez, 69 F.3d 1215,\r\n1225 (1st Cir. 1995).  We only accept such claims \"where the\r\ncritical facts are not genuinely in dispute and the record is\r\nsufficiently developed to allow reasoned consideration of an\r\nineffective assistance of counsel claim. . . .\"  United States v.\r\nNatanel, 938 F.2d 302, 309 (1st Cir. 1991).  This is not such a\r\ncase.  Ford has provided no affidavit from the trial attorney, and\r\nthere is nothing in the record that would indicate the attorney's\r\nthought process.  On such a scant record, we have no means to\r\ndivine what happened.  Therefore, we see no reason to deviate from\r\nour usual rule.  See Martinez-Martinez, 69 F.3d at 1225.\r\nFor the aforementioned reasons, we affirm the revocation\r\nof the supervised release.\r\nAffirmed.\n",
