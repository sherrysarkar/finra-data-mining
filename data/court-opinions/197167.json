Jose Tomas Disla  appeals from his sentence\r                           \r\n\non three grounds.  First, he argues that the sentencing court\r\n\nerred  in failing  to grant  him a  reduction in  his offense\r\n\nlevel for  his role in the offense  as a \"minimal\" or \"minor\"\r\n\nparticipant, pursuant  to Section 3B1.2 of  the United States\r\n\nSentencing Guidelines.   Second,  Disla faults the  court for\r\n\nfailing  to  consider sua  sponte  a  downward departure  for\r                                             \r\n\naberrant  behavior  and  extraordinary family  circumstances.\r\n\nFinally,  he  raises a  claim  of  ineffective assistance  of\r\n\ncounsel.  \r\n\nI. Role in the Offense\r                                  \r\n\n     The  guidelines   define  a  \"minimal\"   participant  as\r\n\n\"plainly among the  least culpable of  those involved in  the\r\n\nconduct  of  a group.  .  .  .    [T]he defendant's  lack  of\r\n\nknowledge or understanding of the scope and structure  of the\r\n\nenterprise and of the activities of others is indicative of a\r\n\nrole as  minimal participant.\" U.S.S.G.    3B1.2(a), comment.\r\n\n(n.1).  A \"minor\"  participant is  defined as  \"less culpable\r\n\nthan most other participants, but whose  conduct could not be\r\n\ndescribed as minimal.\"   U.S.S.G.   3B1.2(b), comment. (n.3).\r\n\nAt  sentencing,  Disla  argued  that  his  participation  was\r\n\n\"minimal.\"  On  appeal, for  the first time,  he argues  that\r\n\neven  if  he did  not qualify  as  a minimal  participant, he\r\n\nshould have received an adjustment for \"minor\" participation.\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n     \"Assessing a defendant's role in the  offense is a fact-\r\n\nspecific  task,   suggesting   by  its   very  nature   'that\r\n\nconsiderable respect be paid  to the views of the  nisi prius\r\n\ncourt.'   It follows, therefore, that unless a mistake of law\r\n\nlooms  .  . .  [,] a  sentencing  court's determination  of a\r\n\ndefendant's role  will be set  aside only  for clear  error.\"\r\n\nUnited  States v.  Tejada-Beltran, 50  F.3d 105,  110-11 (1st\r                                             \r\n\nCir. 1995).\r\n\n     The  district  court  found  that Disla  was  an  \"equal\r\n\npartner  in  the  transaction.   He  knew  the  scope of  the\r\n\nactivity.   He knew it was for the purchase of a large amount\r\n\nof cocaine. .  . . He knew the location of where the drug was\r\n\nto be taken and  sold.\"  The record supports  those findings.\r\n\nDisla  was  one  of  only two  charged  codefendants  in  the\r\n\nconspiracy  to distribute  cocaine.   The record  contains no\r\n\nevidence that  there were participants other  than Disla, his\r\n\nco-defendant  and   the  government  agents.     Under  those\r\n\ncircumstances,  the district  court's  assessment of  Disla's\r\n\nrole  in  the offense  was  not clearly  erroneous.   Disla's\r\n\nadditional claims of legal error are also without merit.\r\n\n     II. Downward Departure\r                                       \r\n\n     For the  first time  on  appeal, Disla  argues that  the\r\n\ndistrict court erred in failing  to make a downward departure\r\n\nfor aberrant behavior and extraordinary family circumstances.\r\n\nDisla's  failure to  request a  downward departure  on either\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nground in the district  court forecloses our consideration of\r\n\nthe issue.  See United  States v. Field, 39 F.3d 15,  21 (1st\r                                                   \r\n\nCir. 1994), cert. denied,    U.S.   , 115 S. Ct. 1806 (1995).\r                                    \r\n\n     III. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\r                                                       \r\n\n     To the  extent that  Disla is  arguing that  he received\r\n\nineffective assistance  of counsel  because his  attorney did\r\n\nnot  move   for  a   departure  for  aberrant   behavior  and\r\n\nextraordinary family circumstances, the claim  is unavailing.\r\n\nThe  record contains scant  evidence of  family circumstances\r\n\nthat  would permit a departure.  See United States v. Rushby,\r                                                                        \r\n\n936  F.2d 41,  42  (1st Cir.  1991)  (holding, on  record  of\r\n\nsimilar   family  circumstances,   that  departure   was  not\r\n\npermitted).   With  respect  to the  failure  to move  for  a\r\n\ndeparture based  upon aberrant behavior, Disla  has failed to\r\n\n\"demonstrate that there  was a  reasonable probability  that,\r\n\nbut  for  counsel's  [alleged]  errors,  the  result  in  the\r\n\nproceeding  would  have  been  different.\"  Carey  v.  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates, 50 F.3d 1097, 1101 (1st Cir. 1995).\r                  \r\n\n     The sentence is summarily affirmed.
