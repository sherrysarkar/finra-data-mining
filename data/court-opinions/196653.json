Plaintiff-appellant Charlotte Flanagan\r                                \r\n\nfiled this diversity action against her  parents, defendants-\r\n\nappellees  Gary  and  Mercia  Grant,  in  the  United  States\r\n\nDistrict Court for the  District of Massachusetts on November\r\n\n12, 1993.   Her  complaint alleged  that her  father sexually\r\n\nabused her for  four years,  beginning in 1980  when she  was\r\n\nfourteen, and that her mother actively helped to cover up the\r\n\nabuse  and  to  coerce  her  to  drop charges  against  him.1\r\n\nDefendants  moved  for  summary  judgment, and,  in  a  well-\r\n\nreasoned  report and  recommendation,  the  magistrate  judge\r\n\nrecommended  allowing  the  motion  on the  ground  that  the\r\n\ncomplaint  was  time-barred   by  the  applicable  three-year\r\n\nstatute  of limitations.  Flanagan v. Grant, 897 F. Supp. 637\r                                                       \r\n\n(D.   Mass.  1995).     The   district  court   accepted  the\r\n\nrecommendation.  Plaintiff appeals. \r\n\n          Having  considered the record, the parties' briefs,\r\n\nand  oral  argument,  we  essentially agree  with  the  lower\r\n\ncourt's reasoning and  result and see no need  to go over the\r\n\nsame ground  in the same detail.   See In re  San Juan Dupont\r                                                                         \r\n\nPlaza Hotel Fire  Litig., 989  F.2d 36, 38  (1st Cir.  1993).\r                                    \r\n\nThe  magistrate  judge  correctly applied  the  Massachusetts\r\n\ndiscovery rule to the facts of this case, taking into account\r\n\nthe controlling  Massachusetts  cases including  the  leading\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.   Plaintiff  claimed assault  and battery,  intentional or\r\nnegligent   infliction  of  emotional   distress,  breach  of\r\nfiduciary duty, and violation of her civil rights.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nauthority, Riley v.

Since issuance  of the lower  court's opinion,  the\r\n\nAppeals  Court  of  Massachusetts  has  handed  down  another\r\n\nrelevant decision, Phinney v. Morgan, 39 Mass. App. Ct.  202,\r                                                \r\n\n654 N.E.2d 77, rev.  denied, 421 Mass. 1104, 656  N.E.2d 1258\r                                       \r\n\n(1995).   Phinney  gives  further support  to the  magistrate\r                             \r\n\njudge's view  that the limitations period  and discovery rule\r\n\nconsidered in  Riley, a  malpractice case, will  apply here.2\r                                \r\n\nIt also lends support to  the present outcome, in that, in  a\r\n\nfairly analogous situation involving parental incest, summary\r\n\njudgment was awarded absent  plaintiffs' showing of a triable\r\n\nissue  as to  whether they  or a  reasonable person  in their\r\n\nposition would have lacked sufficient notice of the cause  of\r\n\ntheir harm within  the applicable time period.   See Phinney,\r                                                                        \r\n\n654 N.E.2d at 81-82.\r\n\n          Focusing, as the lower  court properly did, on when\r\n\nplaintiff knew or had  sufficient notice of the cause  of her\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.    Plaintiff's attempt  to  apply  retroactively a  recent\r\nMassachusetts enactment codifying the discovery rule in cases\r\nof sexual abuse of a minor  does not carry her far.  Even  if\r\nMassachusetts  General Laws ch.260,   4C were to apply, as it\r\nbecame effective December 17, 1993, after plaintiff filed her\r\ncomplaint but  before the  answer was  filed, cf.  Riley, 565\r                                                                    \r\nN.E.2d  at 788 &amp; n.3 (looking at whether stage of proceedings\r\ngoverned  by legislative  change on  tolling had  passed), it\r\nappears in the present circumstances to set out substantially\r\nthe same standard and criteria announced in Riley. \r                                                             \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nharm,3  we  agree that  the  record  demonstrates no  triable\r\n\nissue over whether such knowledge or notice may have occurred\r\n\nonly after November 12, 1990  (the relevant date, three years\r\n\nbefore  the  complaint was  filed).   The  record  contains a\r\n\nplethora of  undisputed  evidence showing  plaintiff's  early\r\n\nawareness of distress resulting from her father's abuse.  She\r\n\nfiled, withdrew, and later refiled (in October 1990) criminal\r\n\ncharges against her father.  She manifested  from 1984 onward\r\n\nher  strong  desire  to   escape  the  repeated  abuse  (and,\r\n\nsubsequently, to help her  sister escape the risk  of abuse).\r\n\nHer own  suicidal  inclinations in  1984  are linked  in  her\r\n\naffidavit  with going  to the  police in  that year  with her\r\n\nmother and  sisters to  protest  her father's  conduct.   Her\r\n\npsychologist,  Dr.  Wayment,  opined  that   plaintiff  could\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.   Appellant concedes, as  the magistrate judge found, that\r\nthere is no  dispute over  the first prong  of the  discovery\r\nrule,  i.e., that plaintiff knew she had been harmed prior to\r                       \r\nNovember  1990.    The  sole  issue  is  whether,  given  Dr.\r\nWayment's   and  plaintiff's   affidavits  relating   to  her\r\ndissociation --  rendering her unable causally  to relate her\r\npsychological injuries to  her father's conduct  -- plaintiff\r\nor a reasonable person who had been subject to her experience\r\nwould have lacked sufficient  knowledge until after  November\r\n12, 1990 that her father caused her injuries.  We believe, in\r\nthis regard,  that the  magistrate judge misspoke  in resting\r\nher  prong  one  finding  solely  on  plaintiff's remembrance\r\nbefore then of \"the incestuous acts.\"  Flanagan, 897 F. Supp.\r                                                           \r\nat 642.  The relevant harm referred to in Riley is not simply\r                                                           \r\nthe  abusive  conduct  itself  but the  psychological  injury\r\ntherefrom.   See Riley, 565  N.E.2d at 786.   Here, appellant\r                                  \r\nconsidered suicide  and  manifested other  forms of  distress\r\nprior to November 1990, making it clear that she was aware of\r\nthe psychological harm prior  to then so as to  satisfy prong\r\none of the discovery rule.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nintellectually  understand  the   relationship  between   her\r\n\nfather's  incest and her feelings, although she did not fully\r\n\nassociate  emotionally   the  incestuous  conduct   with  her\r\n\nfeelings until the fall of 1993.\r\n\n          Riley  held   that   even  though   emotional   and\r                           \r\n\npsychological barriers  may prevent  a plaintiff  from taking\r\n\naction against an abusive  defendant, a plaintiff's knowledge\r\n\nof a causal association between  the abuse and the  resulting\r\n\npsychological  harm suffices  to trigger  the running  of the\r\n\nstatute of limitations.   Riley, 565 N.E.2d at 787;  see also\r                                                                         \r\n\nPhinney,  654 N.E.2d at 81-82.  We think the magistrate judge\r                   \r\n\ndid  not  err  in finding  no  triable  issue  here, and  are\r\n\nconstrained  to agree  with her conclusion  in this  sad case\r\n\nthat  \"[i]n the case at bar, although plaintiff did not fully\r\n\nexperience the extent of the damage inflicted by  her father,\r\n\nshe  nevertheless realized  that  her father  was the  likely\r\n\ncause of her injuries prior to November 12, 1990.\"  Flanagan,\r                                                                        \r\n\n897 F. Supp. at 643.\r\n\n          There is  no merit  in plaintiff's second  argument\r\n\nthat  the district  court inadequately  performed its  review\r\n\nduties because it simply noted its approval on the magistrate\r\n\njudge's  report  itself.

Her complaint alleged that her father sexually abused her for four years, beginning in 1980 when she was fourteen, and that her mother actively helped to cover up the abuse and to coerce her to drop charges against him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Defendants moved for summary judgment, and, in a well-reasoned report and recommendation, the magistrate judge recommended allowing the motion on the ground that the complaint was time-barred by the applicable three-year statute of limitations.  Flanagan v. Grant, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">897</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">637</span></span> (D.Mass.1995).   The district court accepted the recommendation.   Plaintiff appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having considered the record, the parties' briefs, and oral argument, we essentially agree with the lower court's reasoning and result and see no need to go over the same ground in the same detail.   See In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602834\"><a href=\"/opinion/602834/in-re-san-juan-dupont-plaza-hotel-fire-litigation-holders-capital/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 38 (1st Cir.1993).   The magistrate judge correctly applied the Massachusetts discovery rule to the facts of this case, taking into account the controlling Massachusetts cases including the leading authority, Riley v. Presnell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2090844\"><a href=\"/opinion/2090844/riley-v-presnell/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">239</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2090844\"><a href=\"/opinion/2090844/riley-v-presnell/\"><span class=\"volume\">565</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">780</span></a></span> (1991).   Since issuance of the lower court's opinion, the Appeals Court of Massachusetts has handed down another relevant decision, Phinney v. Morgan, 39 Mass.App.Ct. 202, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">654</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></span>, rev. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">1104</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">656</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1258</span></span> (1995).  Phinney gives further support to the magistrate judge's view that the limitations period and discovery rule considered in Riley, a malpractice case, will apply here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  It also lends support to the present outcome, in that, in a fairly analogous situation involving parental incest, summary judgment was awarded absent plaintiffs' showing of a triable issue as to whether they or a reasonable person in their position would have lacked sufficient notice of the cause of their harm within the applicable time period.   See Phinney, 654 N.E.2d at 81-82.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Focusing, as the lower court properly did, on when plaintiff knew or had sufficient notice of the cause of her harm,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> we agree that the record demonstrates no triable issue over whether such knowledge or notice may have occurred only after November 12, 1990 (the relevant date, three years before the complaint was filed).   The record contains a plethora of undisputed evidence showing plaintiff's early awareness of distress resulting from her father's abuse.   She filed, withdrew, and later refiled (in October 1990) criminal charges against her father.   She manifested from 1984 onward her strong desire to escape the repeated abuse (and, subsequently, to help her sister escape the risk of abuse).   Her own suicidal inclinations in 1984 are linked in her affidavit with going to the police in that year with her mother and sisters to protest her father's conduct.   Her psychologist, Dr. Wayment, opined that plaintiff could intellectually understand the relationship between her father's incest and her feelings, although she did not fully associate emotionally the incestuous conduct with her feelings until the fall of 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Riley held that even though emotional and psychological barriers may prevent a plaintiff from taking action against an abusive defendant, a plaintiff's knowledge of a causal association between the abuse and the resulting psychological harm suffices to trigger the running of the statute of limitations.
