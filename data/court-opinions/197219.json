Plaintiffs-appellants  Leila\r                    TORRUELLA, Chief Judge.  \r                                          \r\n\nFrances-Col n and  Juan Enrique  Rodr guez brought  a malpractice\r\n\naction  on  behalf  of  their minor  son  Eric  Rodr guez-Frances\r\n\n(\"Eric\")  against  two  doctors,  a municipal  hospital  and  the\r\n\nmunicipality  of San Juan, on both federal and state law grounds.\r\n\nThey alleged  that the  doctors' mishandling of  Eric's delivery1\r\n\namounted to a violation of Eric's substantive due process rights,\r\n\nactionable under 42 U.S.C.    1983, and that the  defendants were\r\n\nliable for negligence under  Puerto Rico tort law.   The district\r\n\ncourt  granted  defendants' summary  judgment  motion  as to  all\r\n\ncounts, for the  following reasons: (1) the  plaintiffs failed to\r\n\nidentify  a protected  substantive  due process  liberty interest\r\n\ngiving  rise  to  their  federal  civil  rights  claim;  (2)  the\r\n\ndefendants'  actions  were  not  state conduct  that  shocks  the\r\n\nconscience  for the  purposes of  sustaining their  federal civil\r\n\nrights claim; (3) the defendant doctors are immune from liability\r\n\nunder   Puerto  Rico  law;    (4)  the  tort  claim  against  the\r\n\nmunicipality was time-barred under Puerto Rico law.  See Col n v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nRam rez,  913 F. Supp. 112 (D.P.R. 1996).

Plaintiffs  allege  that  the\r\ndefendant doctors acted  with reckless  disregard and  deliberate\r\nindifference by  delivering Eric  vaginally, using forceps,  even\r\nthough his mother  told the  doctors that she  could not  deliver\r\nvaginally.   Eric was born  in poor physical  condition, suffered\r\nsevere   perinatal   asphyxia,   and   has   suffered   permanent\r\ndisabilities. \r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n           Having reviewed the record  and the parties' briefs on\r\n\nappeal, we are satisfied with the reasoning of the decision below\r\n\nand affirm the judgment  for substantially the reasons elucidated\r\n\nin the  district court opinion.   Cf. Lawton  v. State Mut.  Life\r                                                                           \r\n\nAssurance Co., 101  F.3d 218, 220 (1st Cir. 1996)  (\"We have long\r                       \r\n\nproclaimed  that when  a  lower court  produces a  comprehensive,\r\n\nwell-reasoned decision,  an appellate  court should refrain  from\r\n\nwriting at  length to no  other end  than to hear  its own  words\r\n\nresonate.\")  We need only note the following.\r\n\n                I.  The Federal Civil Rights Claim\r                          I.  The Federal Civil Rights Claim\r                                                            \r\n\n          The  district  court  correctly  held  that plaintiffs-\r\n\nappellants  failed to  establish  a violation  of  constitutional\r\n\nrights actionable under section 1983.  Appellants claim on appeal\r\n\nthat, in making this determination, the district court improperly\r\n\nresolved  an issue of fact in favor of defendants by holding that\r\n\nthe  doctors  failed  to   act  with  the  requisite   degree  of\r\n\nculpability  to sustain a section 1983  claim.  See Col n, 913 F.\r                                                                   \r\n\nSupp.  at 119.  Appellants urge us to consider certain affidavits\r\n\nthey produced in support  of the view that the  defendant doctors\r\n\nwere reckless, and not merely negligent.  First, it is  not clear\r\n\nthat the  district court's  statement that plaintiffs  \"failed to\r\n\nshow  that   defendants  acted  with  the   requisite  degree  of\r\n\nculpability\" means that the  district court explicitly found that\r\n\ndefendants were not reckless.  More importantly, there is no need\r\n\nto arrive at a  factual conclusion regarding whether  the doctors\r\n\nwere negligent or something  more than negligent, because, either\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nway, the plaintiffs fail to state a cause of action under section\r\n\n1983.   As the district  court opinion explains,  plaintiffs must\r\n\nfail  on their civil rights claim because they do not demonstrate\r\n\neither of the following:  that there was an interest protected by\r\n\nthe due process clause  at stake, or that there  was governmental\r\n\nconduct  that  \"shocks  the conscience.\"    See  id.   at  116-18\r                                                              \r\n\n(applying Pittsley v. Warish, 927 F.2d 3, 6 (1st Cir. 1991)).\r                                      \r\n\n          It is surprising,  in light of clear Supreme  Court and\r\n\nFirst Circuit precedent, that  appellants would consider it worth\r\n\ntheir while to try their luck, or, rather, waste time and energy,\r\n\nwith what is  essentially a malpractice claim  clothed in section\r\n\n1983, civil rights,  language.   This is  plainly not a situation\r\n\nin which the  state \"takes  a person into  custody and holds  him\r\n\nthere  against   his  will,\"   thereby  implicating  a   possible\r\n\nconstitutional  due process  interest in  adequate medical  care.\r\n\nDeShaney v. Winnebago  County Dept.  of Social  Servs., 489  U.S.\r                                                                \r\n\n189,   199-200  (1989).    To  avoid  future  waste  of  judicial\r\n\nresources, we wish to underscore  the decisive legal principle in\r\n\nthis  case.    A  substantive  due  process  interest  in \"bodily\r\n\nintegrity\" or  \"adequate medical  care\" cannot support a personal\r\n\ninjury  claim  under  section  1983  against  the  provider of  a\r\n\ngovernmental  service unless:  (a) the  government has  taken the\r\n\nclaimant  into custody or  otherwise coerced the  claimant into a\r\n\nsituation where  he cannot  attend to  his  own well-being,  see,\r                                                                          \r\n\ne.g., Monahan v.

Daniels v. Williams,  474 U.S. 327,\r                                                           \r\n\n332 (1986).  Appellant's counsel would have done well to consider\r\n\nmore carefully the  cases it cites  for support in  its brief  --\r\n\nsuch  as the following passage from Estate of Gilmore v. Buckley,\r                                                                          \r\n\n787  F.2d  714, 722  (1st Cir.  1986)  (holding failure  of state\r\n\nemployees  to protect victim  from murderous attack  by inmate on\r\n\nfurlough not actionable under section 1983):2\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  See Brief for Appellants at 17.\r                \r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n          Enormous  economic consequences  could follow\r\n          from the reading  of the fourteenth amendment\r\n          that plaintiff here urges.   Firemen who have\r\n          been alerted to a  victim's peril but fail to\r\n          take  effective action;  municipal ambulances\r\n          which,  when called, arrive  late; and myriad\r\n          other  errors by state officials in providing\r\n          protective  services, could  all be  found to\r\n          violate  the  Constitution.    It  would seem\r\n          appropriate   that   the  citizenry,   acting\r\n          through state legislatures and  state courts,\r\n          should determine  how far it wishes  to go in\r\n          reimbursing claims of this  type.  We can see\r\n          no  justification  for   rewriting  the   due\r\n          process clause of the federal Constitution so\r\n          as to  construct a basis for  relief that can\r\n          be more flexibly  provided elsewhere, if that\r\n          is deemed advisable.\r\n\n         II.  Defendants' Immunity under Puerto Rico Law\r                   II.  Defendants' Immunity under Puerto Rico Law\r                                                                  \r\n\n          It is undisputed that the defendant doctors were acting\r\n\nas government employees when they were attending to Eric's birth.\r\n\nThe district court correctly held  that the doctors are protected\r\n\nunder  the  immunity  for  government  health care  professionals\r\n\nprovided by  P.R. Laws Ann. tit.  26,   4105 (1989).   On appeal,\r\n\nappellants  repeat  their  argument  that  the  doctors'  alleged\r\n\nrecklessness brings them  outside of this immunity provision.  We\r\n\nnote  that the Puerto  Rico Supreme  Court's decision  in V squez\r                                                                           \r\n\nNegr n v.  E.L.A., 113  D.P.R. 148,  151  (1982), interprets  the\r                           \r\n\nimmunity  provision  broadly,  adding  further  strength  to  the\r\n\ndistrict  court's holding  that the  sole inquiry  required under\r\n\nPuerto  Rico  law  in  determining whether  immunity  applies  is\r\n\nwhether the health care professional was acting as an employee of\r\n\nthe government at the time of the events giving rise to the suit.\r\n\n          This much said, we allow the district court  opinion to\r\n\nspeak for itself.\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                    Affirmed\r                            \r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n",

To avoid future waste of judicial resources, we wish to underscore the decisive legal principle in this case.  A substantive due process interest in \"bodily integrity\" or \"adequate medical care\" cannot support a personal injury claim under section 1983 against the provider of a governmental service unless:  (a) the government has taken the claimant into custody or otherwise coerced the claimant into a situation where he cannot attend to his own well-being, see, e.g., Monahan v. Dorchester Counseling Ctr., Inc., 961 F.2d 987, 990-93 (1st Cir.1992) (no due process claim where claimant voluntarily entered mental institution) (applying DeShaney );  or (b) the government employee, in the rare and exceptional case, affirmatively acts to increase the threat of harm to the claimant or affirmatively prevents the individual from receiving assistance, see Dwares v. City of New York, 985 F.2d 94, 96 (2d Cir.1993) (due process implicated where complaint under section 1983 alleged that police assured skin-heads that they could attack protestors with impunity, thereby affirmatively increasing threat of harm to protestors) (distinguishing DeShaney );  Ross v. United States, 910 F.2d 1422, 1429-34 (7th Cir.1990) (due process interest in life implicated where county officials prevented city officials from rescuing drowning boy, thereby affirmatively restricting source of aid) (distinguishing DeShaney ).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A proximate causal link between a government agent's actions and a personal injury does not, in itself, bring a case out of the realm of tort law and into the domain of constitutional due process.  Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327, 332, 106 S.Ct. 662, 665-666, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986).  Appellant's counsel would have done well to consider more carefully the cases it cites for support in its brief--such as the following passage from Estate of Gilmore v. Buckley, 787 F.2d 714, 722 (1st Cir.1986) (holding failure of state employees to protect victim from murderous attack by inmate on furlough not actionable under section 1983):<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>Enormous economic consequences could follow from the reading of the fourteenth amendment that plaintiff here urges.  Firemen who have been alerted to a victim's peril but fail to take effective action;  municipal ambulances which, when called, arrive late;  and myriad other errors by state officials in providing protective services, could all be found to violate the Constitution.  It would seem appropriate that the citizenry, acting through state legislatures and state courts, should determine how far it wishes to go in reimbursing claims of this type.  We can see no justification for rewriting the due process clause of the federal Constitution so as to construct a basis for relief that can be more flexibly provided elsewhere, if that is deemed advisable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>II.

They alleged that the doctors' mishandling of Eric's delivery<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> amounted to a violation of Eric's substantive due process rights, actionable under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, and that the defendants were liable for negligence under Puerto Rico tort law.  The district court granted defendants' summary judgment motion as to all counts, for the following reasons:  (1) the plaintiffs failed to identify a protected substantive due process liberty interest giving rise to their federal civil rights claim;  (2) the defendants' actions were not state conduct that shocks the conscience for the purposes of sustaining their federal civil rights claim;  (3) the defendant doctors are immune from liability under Puerto Rico law;  (4) the tort claim against the municipality was time-barred under Puerto Rico law.

The Federal Civil Rights Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court correctly held that plaintiffs-appellants failed to establish a violation of constitutional rights actionable under section 1983.  Appellants claim on appeal that, in making this determination, the district court improperly resolved an issue of fact in favor of defendants by holding that the doctors failed to act with the requisite degree of culpability to sustain a section 1983 claim.  See Coln, 913 F.Supp. at 119.   Appellants urge us to consider certain affidavits they produced in support of the view that the defendant doctors were reckless, and not merely negligent.  First, it is not clear that the district court's statement that plaintiffs \"failed to show that defendants acted with the requisite degree of culpability\" means that the district court explicitly found that defendants were not reckless.  More importantly, there is no need to arrive at a factual conclusion regarding whether the doctors were negligent or something more than negligent, because, either way, the plaintiffs fail to state a cause of action under section 1983.  As the district court opinion explains, plaintiffs must fail on their civil rights claim because they do not demonstrate either of the following:  that there was an interest protected by the due process clause at stake, or that there was governmental conduct that \"shocks the conscience.\"   See id. at 116-18 (applying Pittsley v. Warish, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556634\"><a href=\"/opinion/556634/danielle-j-pittsley-v-sergeant-philip-warish/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir.1991)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is surprising, in light of clear Supreme Court and First Circuit precedent, that appellants would consider it worth their while to try their luck, or, rather, waste time and energy, with what is essentially a malpractice claim clothed in section 1983, civil rights, language.  This is plainly not a situation in which the state \"takes a person into custody and holds him there against his will,\" thereby implicating a possible constitutional due process interest in adequate medical care.
