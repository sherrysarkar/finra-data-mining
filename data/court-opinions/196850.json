Prior  to   its  repeal   in  1994,   a\r                            \r\n\nMassachusetts  statute providing for  the award  of good-time\r\n\ncredits to state prisoners specifically withheld such credits\r\n\nfrom  inmates  who  had  been  convicted  of  enumerated  sex\r\n\noffenses.   See Mass.  Gen. L., ch.  127,   129.   Plaintiffs\r                           \r\n\nhere, a group of prisoners serving sentences for  sex crimes,\r\n\nhave brought  an action  under 42  U.S.C.   1983  challenging\r\n\nthis statutory exclusion on various  constitutional grounds.1\r                                                                        1\r\n\nThe  lower court rejected each of their claims at the summary\r\n\njudgment stage.  On  the arguendo assumption that plaintiffs'\r                                             \r\n\ncontentions are cognizable  in a civil-rights  action (rather\r\n\nthan a habeas corpus proceeding), we summarily affirm for the\r\n\nreasons recited by the magistrate-judge in his June 23,  1995\r\n\nreport.  We add only the following.\r\n\n     Underlying   several  of   plaintiffs'  claims   is  the\r\n\nassertion  that their inability  to obtain  good-time credits\r\n\nconstitutes a separate \"punishment\" apart from that  incurred\r\n\nat sentencing.   This is  mistaken.  The  statutory exclusion\r\n\nwas enacted in 1965,  see Amado v. Superintendent,  366 Mass.\r                                                             \r\n\n45, 48 (1974) (reviewing  statutory history)--long before any\r\n\nof  the plaintiffs  had been  convicted.   Accordingly, their\r\n\nineligibility  for such credits can only be viewed as part of\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1   Of the  more than fifty  plaintiffs who  joined in the\r               1\r\naction  below, only  some fourteen  are participating  in the\r\ninstant appeals.    We  assume  arguendo  that  each  of  the\r                                                    \r\nappellants has properly invoked this court's jurisdiction.  \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nthe punishment  imposed by the sentencing  court after trial.\r\n\nPlaintiffs'  assertion that the  exclusion constitutes a bill\r\n\nof  attainder fails  for this  reason (among  others).   See,\r                                                                        \r\n\ne.g.,  United  States v.  Brown,  381 U.S.  437,  450 (1965).\r                                           \r\n\nTheir  additional claim  that the  exclusion  violates double\r\n\njeopardy (a claim which we assume arguendo is properly before\r                                                      \r\n\nus) falters on  the same ground.  Even  if the exclusion were\r\n\nviewed  as  a cumulative  punishment  for  the same  offense,\r\n\ndouble  jeopardy would  not be  offended.  See,  e.g., United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates  v.  Centeno-Torres, 50  F.3d 84,  85 (1st  Cir.)

Ct. 208 (1995).\r                                 \r\n\n     The allegation that the  exclusion violates due  process\r\n\nproves  equally unavailing.   Plaintiffs  possess no  liberty\r\n\ninterest in  receiving good-time credits.   See, e.g., Sandin\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Conner, 115 S.

And the statutory\r\n\nscheme found violative of substantive due process in Young v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nWeston, 898 F. Supp. 744, 748-51 (W.D. Wash. 1995), a case on\r                  \r\n\nwhich plaintiffs rely, bears no resemblance to the one before\r\n\nus.   Finally,  the  contention that  the exclusion  violates\r\n\nequal  protection  runs into  a  wall  of caselaw  indicating\r\n\notherwise.   See, e.g., Riddle, 83 F.3d at 1207-08; Artway v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nAttorney General  of New  Jersey, 81  F.3d 1235,  1267-68 (3d\r                                            \r\n\nCir. 1996);  Lustgarden v.
