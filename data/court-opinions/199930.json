Héctor M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n           Torruella, Selya, and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Harry Anduze Montaño for appellants Kennedy and Rivera.\n\n     Linda Backiel for appellants Ayala and Ortíz.\n\n     Stella Song, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nGuillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Jorge E. Vega-Pacheco,\nAssistant United States Attorney, and Frank J. Bustamonte, Special\nAssistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n                         April 29, 2002\n\f           LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.           Rafael Ayala Ayala, Robert F.\n\nKennedy, Jr., Dennis Hickey Rivera, and Armando Torres Ortíz were\n\nconvicted of entering onto the Camp García Naval Installation on\n\nthe   island   of   Vieques,   in    violation    of   18    U.S.C.   §   1382.\n\nUnpersuaded    by   their   arguments      on   appeal,     we   affirm   their\n\nconvictions.\n\n                               I. Background\n\n           On April 28, 2001, appellants participated in a campaign\n\nof civil disobedience aimed at disrupting live-fire artillery and\n\nbombardment exercises which the Navy periodically conducts in and\naround Vieques.     Each was charged with violating 18 U.S.C. § 1382\n(barring   entry    \"upon   any     military,    naval,     or   Coast    Guard\nreservation, post, fort, arsenal, yard, station, or installation,\n\nfor any purpose prohibited by law or lawful regulation\"). The four\ncases (along with four others) were consolidated for trial in the\ndistrict court on July 6, 2001.            Appellants were convicted and\n\nsentenced to thirty days' imprisonment.\n           On appeal, Ayala and Ortíz argue that the informations\nagainst them should have been dismissed because the government\nfailed to take them before a magistrate within 48 hours of their\n\narrest; that the government did not prove that they had entered\n\nonto a naval installation in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1382; and\n\nthat the evidence at trial was insufficient to establish that they\n\nwere among the individuals detained on Vieques on April 28, 2001.\n\nKennedy and Rivera argue that the district court judge erred in\n\nrefusing to permit them to put on a defense of necessity, and in\n\n                                     -2-\n\fnot recusing himself from the case.         We address these issues in\n\nturn.\n\n                        II. The 48-Hour Rule\n\n          Federal   Rule    of   Criminal   Procedure   5(a)   states,    in\npertinent part, that \"any person making an arrest without a warrant\n\nshall take the arrested person without unnecessary delay before the\n\nnearest available federal magistrate judge.\"        Although Rule 5(a)\ndoes not specify what would constitute an \"unnecessary delay,\"\n\ncourts   have   construed   the    Fourth   Amendment    as    imposing    a\n\npresumptive 48-hour time limit on detentions in the absence of a\nprobable cause determination.1      \"Where an arrested individual does\nnot receive a probable cause determination within 48 hours,\" the\nburden is on the government \"to demonstrate the existence of a bona\n\nfide emergency or other extraordinary circumstance.\"             County of\n\nRiverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 57 (1991).               Having been\nbrought before a magistrate approximately 51 hours after their\n\ninitial detention, Ayala and Ortíz argue that the district court\nerred in denying their motion to dismiss the informations against\nthem on that ground.   We review the district court's construction\nof Rule 5(a) and the Fourth Amendment de novo, and its factual\n\ndeterminations for clear error.      United States v. Encarnacíon, 239\n\nF.3d 395, 397 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n     1\n        On the interaction of Rule 5(a) and the Fourth Amendment,\nwe have observed that \"[w]hile the Rule 5(a) and Fourth Amendment\ncontexts are certainly analogous, the 48-hours rule is a\nrequirement of the Fourth Amendment, not Rule 5(a).\" United States\nv. Encarnacíon, 239 F.3d 395, 398 n.2 (1st Cir. 2001) (citation and\ninternal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                                   -3-\n\f          Ayala    and   Ortíz's   motion   to   dismiss   asserted   the\n\nfollowing facts, which the government has not disputed. Appellants\n\nwere detained by military personnel at approximately 11:20 a.m. on\nApril 28 and transported to a detention/processing center at Camp\n\nGarcía (on Vieques), where they were searched, questioned, and\n\nphotographed. The next morning appellants were transported by boat\nto Roosevelt Roads, a naval installation on the main island of\n\nPuerto Rico, where they were again searched, questioned, and\n\nphotographed.     \"Late on Sunday night,\" April 29, appellants were\n\nmoved to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Guaynabo.        Some time\n\nafter 2:00 p.m. on April 30, Ayala and Ortíz were taken before a\n\nmagistrate.\n\n          The government filed a cursory response: \"The motion is\nwithout merit.    It has been rejected by the sections of this Court\n\nconsidering this issue.     See e.g. Memorandum Order by Judge José\n\nAntonio Fusté, dated June 1, 2001, in the case of United States v.\n\nCecilio Lebron, #01-330.      Based upon the extraordinary demands\n\nfixed by the large number of arrestees brought over from Vieques\n\nIsland, the time elapsed was not unreasonable.\"\n\n          At trial, in denying the motion to dismiss, the district\n\ncourt said that 181 individuals had been arrested in the \"wave\" of\n\ntrespassers which included Ayala and Ortíz, and that the large\n\nnumber of detainees, and the transportation required to get them\n\nbefore a magistrate, constituted \"extraordinary circumstances\" that\n\nwarranted an exception to the 48-hour rule. The district court was\n\nentitled to take judicial notice of the 181 arrests, a circumstance\n\n                                   -4-\n\freadily ascertainable by the district court.              See Fed. R. Evid.\n\n201(b)(2)    (authorizing    judicial     notice   of    facts   \"capable   of\n\naccurate    and   ready   determination    by   resort    to   sources   whose\naccuracy cannot reasonably be questioned\").         Although the relevant\n\nfacts in the record are regrettably sparse, the district court\n\nconcluded correctly that over 100 civil disobedience arrests at a\nnaval base on an island off the coast of Puerto Rico, executed in\n\nthe midst of a military exercise, constitute an extraordinary\n\ncircumstance sufficient to justify the slight delay beyond 48 hours\n\nin bringing Ayala and Ortíz before a magistrate.2\n\n     2\n        In United States v. Salivas-González, 147 F. Supp. 2d 58\n(D.P.R. 2001), a case arising out of the same Vieques protest,\nJudge Fusté ruled that delays in excess of 48 hours in taking\ndetainees before a magistrate were justified by extraordinary\ncircumstances. This is presumably the opinion the government had\nin mind in its motion to dismiss, which cited a \"Memorandum Order\nby Judge José Antonio Fusté, dated June 1, 2001\" (same date as\nSalivas-González). Judge Fusté gave a detailed explanation of the\ncircumstances which he deemed extraordinary:\n\n          The logistics entailed by the Navy arrest and\n     processing, and the eventual civil processing and\n     transportation of the arrestees to the metropolitan area\n     was not a simple task.     The majority of Deputy U.S.\n     Marshals available had been previously assigned to secure\n     the perimeters within the naval base at Camp García,\n     leaving a small number of Deputy U.S. Marshals available\n     for the processing of arrestees.          Thus, special\n     consideration should be given to:\n\n            (a) the limited transportation means between\n            Vieques and Puerto Rico;\n\n            (b) the burdensome conditions being faced by\n            the U.S. Marshals (limited available personnel\n            to arrest, process, and transport over one-\n            hundred   arrestees,   while   still   meeting\n            security requirements);\n\n            (c) the large number of violent incidents\n            being reported (which excluded the possibility\n\n                                   -5-\n\f           In Encarnacíon, we reserved the question \"whether Rule\n\n5(a) can ever be a basis for dismissal of an indictment absent\n\nevidence   of   unwarranted   interrogation   during   the   period   of\ndetention.\"     239 F.3d at 400 n.5.     Without now deciding that\n\nquestion, we also note the absence in this case of any claim of\n\nprejudice arising out of appellants' detention beyond 48 hours.\n\n                        III. The Informations\n\n           The informations charged that Ayala and Ortíz had entered\n\nonto \"lands reserved for the exclusive jurisdiction of the United\n\nStates\" in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1382, which provides for\npunishment of \"[w]hoever, within the jurisdiction of the United\n\nStates, goes upon any military, naval, or Coast Guard reservation,\npost, fort, arsenal, yard, station, or installation, for any\npurpose prohibited by law or lawful regulation.\"       Ayala and Ortíz\n\nmoved under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29 for a judgment of\n\n\n           of assigning a judicial officer to conduct\n           initial proceedings to any other place than\n           secure/court premises) . . . .\n\n     [U]pon receiving notice that the U.S. Marshals did not\n     have sufficient personnel to escort over one-hundred\n     arrestees to court, arrangements were made to hold the\n     initial appearances at MDC-Guaynabo, the most logical\n     place that could accommodate the large number of people\n     to be handled.   All regular visits to MDC had to be\n     canceled by the Bureau of Prisons.       Equipment was\n     gathered for use, such as copy machines and faxes.\n     Personnel was assigned to process the individuals,\n     including two magistrates, two courtroom deputy clerks,\n     two interpreters, and various other court employees. A\n     system had to be devised between the Clerk's Office and\n     MDC to coordinate bond, bond setting and taking of the\n     bond monies.\n\nId. at 61-62 (footnote omitted).\n\n                                 -6-\n\facquittal at the close of the prosecution's case, arguing, inter\n\nalia, that the piece of land on which they were arrested, the South\n\nSalinas Finger, is not \"reserved for the exclusive jurisdiction of\nthe United States,\" as the informations allege. In their view, the\n\nSouth Salinas Finger is not part of a \"military, naval, or Coast\n\nGuard reservation,\" but instead is \"submerged land[]\" which has\nbeen placed \"under the control of the government of Puerto Rico\"\n\npursuant to 48 U.S.C. § 749.   Our review of the district court's\n\ndenial of a Rule 29 motion is de novo.   United States v. Frigerio-\n\nMigiano, 254 F.3d 30, 33 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n          We agree with Ayala and Ortíz that the government failed\n\nto prove that the South Salinas Finger is encompassed within the\n\nboundaries of the Camp García naval reservation proper.       Petty\nOfficer Larry Werner Roberts II described the South Salinas Finger\n\nas \"a little island on the south\" side of Vieques.     He testified\n\nthat \"[i]t has a little land that connects the beach to the\nisland,\" a natural bridge of approximately 35 feet.3    However, a\n\nline on the map the prosecution offered into evidence depicting the\n\nordinary high-tide line at Vieques -- the boundary of the Navy's\n\nholdings -- does not encompass the location of the South Salinas\n\n\n     3\n        Although Roberts described the South Salinas Finger as an\n\"island,\" the government says that it is a peninsula.          The\nevidence, however, did not establish whether, at high tide, the\nSouth Salinas Finger is connected to Vieques by land.      Roberts\ntestified that he did not recall his feet getting wet as he walked\nout to this \"island,\" but there was no testimony concerning the\nstatus of the tide at the time of the arrests. We need not resolve\nthis question, because, as explained infra, the government was not\nrequired to prove that the South Salinas Finger was part of Camp\nGarcía proper.\n\n                               -7-\n\fFinger.       Instead, the portion of the map that corresponds to its\n\nlocation is blank.\n\n               As the line on the Navy's map marking the mean high-tide\nline around Camp García does not depict the South Salinas Finger,\n\nAyala and Ortíz argue that it must therefore be among Puerto Rico's\n\n\"submerged lands,\" which are \"under the control of the government\nof Puerto Rico.\"          48 U.S.C. § 749.4       The statute defines \"control\"\n\nto     include     \"all    right,   title       and   interest   in   and   to   and\n\njurisdiction and authority over the submerged lands underlying the\n\nharbor areas and navigable streams and bodies of water in and\n\naround the island of Puerto Rico and the adjacent islands and\n\nwaters.\"       Id. § 749(3).        Ayala and Ortíz assert that the South\n\nSalinas Finger \"is a classic example of submerged coastal [lands]\nover       which   'all    right,   title      and    interest   in   and   to   and\n\njurisdiction and authority' has been placed in the hands of Puerto\n\nRico\" (quoting 48 U.S.C. § 749(3)), and that their venture onto the\nSouth Salinas Finger thus could not have been an entrance onto\n\nlands \"reserved for the exclusive jurisdiction of the United\n\nStates,\" as the informations allege.\n\n               Again,     Ayala   and   Ortíz    have   a   point.    Because    the\n\ngovernment failed to prove that the South Salinas Finger is above\n\nthe mean high-tide line, we must accept the proposition in this\n\ncase that it is indeed \"submerged land[]\" placed \"under the control\n\n\n       4\n       \"Submerged lands\" are defined to \"include lands permanently\nor periodically covered by tidal waters up to but not above the\nline of mean high tide.\" 48 U.S.C. § 749(1).\n\n                                         -8-\n\fof the government of Puerto Rico\" by 48 U.S.C. § 749.              Such\n\nsubmerged lands are not \"reserved for the exclusive jurisdiction of\n\nthe   United   States,\"   as   the   informations   allege.    However,\n\"[c]onvictions generally have been sustained as long as the proof\n\nupon which they are based corresponds to an offense that was\n\nclearly set out in the indictment.           A part of the indictment\nunnecessary to and independent of the allegations of the offense\n\nproved may normally be treated as a useless averment that may be\n\nignored.\"      United States v. Miller, 471 U.S. 130, 136 (1985)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).        In other words, \"[s]urplusage\n\nin an indictment need not be proved.\"         United States v. McVeigh,\n\n153 F.3d 1166, 1196 (10th Cir. 1998).             The phrase \"on lands\n\nreserved for the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States\" is\nsurplusage.5    If we disregard it, the informations still charge\n\nunmistakably that Ayala and Ortíz knowingly and unlawfully entered\n\n\n\n\n      5\n       The text of the information charging Ortíz with a violation\nof § 1382 reads as follows:\n\n      On or about April 28, 2001, in the District of Puerto\n      Rico and within the jurisdiction of this Court, that is,\n      on Camp Garcia Naval Installation at Vieques, Puerto\n      Rico, that is, on lands reserved for the exclusive\n      jurisdiction of the United States, ARMANDO TORRES ORTIZ,\n      defendant, did knowingly and unlawfully go upon said\n      Naval installation for any purpose prohibited by law or\n      lawful regulation, that is, 32 CFR Section 770.35 through\n      770.40, without first having obtained permission from the\n      Commanding Officer as required by the aforesaid\n      regulations. All in violation of Title 18, United States\n      Code, Section 1382.\n\nThe text of the information charging Ayala is identical in all\nmaterial respects.\n\n                                     -9-\n\fthe Camp García Naval Installation in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1382.6\n\n               The government's proof at trial established this unlawful\nentry.        In United States v. Ventura-Meléndez, another Vieques\n\ntrespassing case, we held that \"'government ownership of the\n\nproperty in question is not a requisite to violating Section\n1382.'\"       275 F.3d 9, 16 (1st Cir. 2001) (quoting United States v.\n\nAllen, 924 F.2d 29, 31 (2d Cir. 1991)).               Instead, a conviction\n\nunder    18    U.S.C.   §   1382   \"requires   only   that   the   government\n\ndemonstrate either a possessory interest in, or occupation or\n\ncontrol of, the area reserved by the military.\"                    Id. at 17.\n\nApplying that rule to the installation on Vieques, we held that a\n\nportion of \"the area beyond the mean high-tide lines [was] under\nthe occupation and control of the Navy for purposes of § 1382\"\n\nbecause \"a large swath of area extending beyond the shoreline of\n\nthe beach was permissibly designated as part of a 'danger zone' by\nfederal regulation\" and therefore was subject to Navy occupation\n\nand control.      Id. at 17 (citing 33 C.F.R. §§ 334.2, 334.1480).           We\n\nexplained that \"Puerto Rico's jurisdiction over the shoreline was\n\nestablished subject to the control of the United States.\"              Id.\n\n\n\n     6\n        The surplus language in the informations does not obscure\nthe conduct that the government alleges violated § 1382: entry onto\nthe Camp García Naval Installation. Ayala and Ortíz do not claim\nto have been in any way misled or unfairly prejudiced in their\ndefense by the government's inaccurate description of the land as\n\"reserved for the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.\"\nSee Miller, 471 U.S. at 138 n.5. (disregarding surplusage where\nappellant \"show[ed] no prejudice to his ability to defend himself\nat trial\").\n\n                                      -10-\n\f          There was uncontested evidence at trial that the South\n\nSalinas Finger, the land on which Ayala and Ortíz were found, was\n\nlocated inside a \"danger zone\" established by federal regulation.\nSee 33 C.F.R. §§ 334.2, 334.1470.   A \"danger zone\" is \"[a] defined\n\nwater area . . . used for target practice, bombing, rocket firing\n\nor other especially hazardous operations, normally for the armed\nforces,\" and \"may be closed to the public on a full-time or\n\nintermittent basis, as stated in the regulations.\"7      33 C.F.R.\n\n§ 334.2(a).\n\n          Ayala and Ortíz counter that they were not charged with\n\nviolating 33 C.F.R. § 334.1470 (barring entry into a danger zone),\n\nbut rather 32 C.F.R. § 770.40 (barring entry onto \"U.S. Naval\n\ninstallations and properties\").       However, we held in Ventura-\n\nMeléndez, 275 F.3d at 16-18, that the language of § 1382, which on\n\nits face is limited to \"[w]hoever . . . goes upon any military,\n\nnaval, or Coast Guard reservation, post, fort, arsenal, yard,\n\n\n\n     7\n        The boundaries of the danger zone that encompasses the\nSouth Salinas Finger are as follows:\n\n     From Punta Conejo on the south coast of Vieques       at\n     latitude 18°06'30\", longitude 65°22'33\"; thence       to\n     latitude 18°03'00\", longitude 65°21'00\"; thence       to\n     latitude 18°03'00\", longitude 65°15'30\"; thence       to\n     latitude 18°11'30\", longitude 65°14'30\"; thence       to\n     latitude 18°12'00\", longitude 65°20'00\"; and thence   to\n     Cabellos Colorados on the north coast of Vieques      at\n     latitude 18°09'49\", longitude 65°23'27\".\n\n§ 334.1470(a). The danger zone is \"open to navigation at all times\nexcept when firing is being conducted.        At such times, no\npersons . . . shall enter or remain within the danger area.\"\n§ 334.1470(b)(1).\n\n                               -11-\n\fstation, or installation,\" also extends to those who enter into a\n\ndanger zone in proximity to a reservation, post, fort, arsenal,\n\nyard, station, or installation.       That being so, the distinction\nAyala and    Ortíz   advance,   between   entering   a   danger   zone   and\n\nentering a naval installation, is without significance in this\n\ncontext.8\n\n                                IV. Notice\n\n            Section 1382 bars entry into a military installation \"for\n\nany purpose prohibited by law or lawful regulation.\"         To establish\n\na prohibited purpose, the informations cited 32 C.F.R. § 770.40,\nwhich provides that \"[a]ny person entering or remaining on U.S.\n\nNaval installations and properties in Puerto Rico, without the\nadvance consent of [enumerated officials], shall be . . . subject\nto the penalties prescribed by 18 U.S.C. § 1382.\"        This reliance on\n\nthe regulation is consistent with our holding in United States v.\n\nParrilla Bonilla, 648 F.2d 1373, 1377 (1st Cir. 1981), that \"the\n\n\n\n     8\n         There was also uncontroverted evidence that the South\nSalinas Finger was inside a security zone that was in existence on\nApril 28, 2001. A security zone is \"an area of land, water, or\nland and water which is so designated by the Captain of the Port or\nDistrict Commander for such time as is necessary to prevent damage\nor injury to any vessel or waterfront facility, to safeguard ports,\nharbors, territories, or waters of the United States or to secure\nthe observance of the rights and obligations of the United States.\"\n33 C.F.R. § 165.30(a). The regulations provide that \"[n]o person\nor vessel may enter or remain in a security zone without the\npermission of the Captain of the Port.\" 33 C.F.R. § 165.33(a). In\nAllen, the Second Circuit held that unauthorized entry into a\nsecurity zone around a naval reservation was itself a violation of\n18 U.S.C. § 1382. 924 F.2d at 30-31. As appellants' entry into\nthe danger zone is sufficient to support their conviction, we need\nnot decide whether entry into the security zone alone in this case\nviolated § 1382.\n\n                                  -12-\n\frequisite prohibited 'purpose' under section 1382 can consist of\n\nunauthorized entry itself.\"\n\n           We have said that \"when a section 1382 prosecution\nproceeds on the basis that the defendant has entered a restricted\n\nmilitary reservation 'for the purpose of' unauthorized entry, . . .\n\nit must be shown that the defendant had knowledge or notice that\nsuch entry was, in fact, prohibited.\"             Id.   In the case of the\n\nregulation establishing the danger zone at issue in Ventura-\n\nMeléndez, the regulation itself states that \"[n]o person or vessel\n\nshall enter or remain within the restricted areas at any time\n\nunless on official business.\"           § 334.1480(b).        The regulation\n\nestablishing the danger zone at issue in this case, however,\n\nstipulates that \"[i]t will be open to navigation at all times\nexcept   when   firing   is   being    conducted.       At   such   times,   no\n\npersons . . . shall enter or remain within the danger area.\"\n\n§ 334.1470(b)(1).        To prove a violation of § 1382, then, the\ngovernment was required to demonstrate that notice was given that\n\nthe danger zone was closed to the public at the time of the\n\narrests.\n\n           There was testimony to that effect at trial.             Lieutenant\n\nCommander Russell Gottfried indicated that notice of imminent\n\nmilitary activities within the danger zone had been given in the\n\nform of a fishermen's notice that was distributed around Vieques a\n\nweek in advance of the exercises.            In addition to the fishermen's\n\nnotice, Gottfried testified that a temporary security zone was\n\nestablished to prevent intrusions into the danger zone during the\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\flive-fire exercises, and that he heard notice of the security zone\n\nbroadcast over marine band radio \"several times a day in the course\n\nof the operations.\"9   In the Navy's view, these broadcasts supplied\nadditional notice that entry into the danger zone -- and thus onto\n\nthe South Salinas Finger -- was prohibited.10\n\n            Although there are two vague references to lack of notice\nin their brief, Ayala and Ortíz do not make a developed mens rea\n\nargument to the effect that they personally lacked knowledge or\n\nnotice of the exclusion of the public from the South Salinas\n\nFinger.    The two references appear in the section of the brief\n\nchallenging the government's failure to prove that appellants were\n\nfound on land \"reserved for the exclusive jurisdiction of the\n\nUnited States.\"    There Ayala and Ortíz assert that \"the Navy had\ntaken no action to warn others that it considered [the South\n\nSalinas Finger] part of its exclusive domain in Vieques\" (emphasis\n\nadded). This statement is explicitly linked to the exclusive\njurisdiction argument that we have rejected. They subsequently add\n\nthat the land was \"in no way posted or otherwise identified to the\npublic as part of Camp García or land controlled by the Navy.\"11\n\n     9\n          The security zone is described supra at note 8.\n     10\n        Of course, the broadcasts also served to give notice that\nentry into the security zone itself was prohibited.\n     11\n        There is arguably a third, even more oblique reference, to\na lack of warning that the South Salinas Finger was off limits to\nthe public.    Appellants say that the danger zone created for\nexercises in Vieques did not warn that violation would result in\nprosecution. This statement seems to register a complaint about an\ninadequate warning of the consequences of a violation. Notably,\nthe comment does not suggest a misapprehension about the fact that\nentry into the danger zone would be a violation.\n\n                                 -14-\n\fThis unelaborated reference to inadequate notice falls far short of\n\na developed argument that the government's proof did not satisfy\n\nthe mens rea element of § 1382.      To the extent that there is a mens\nrea claim lurking in the exclusive jurisdiction argument of Ayala\n\nand Ortíz, we deem it waived.        See United States v. Zannino, 895\n\nF.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"Issues adverted to in a perfunctory\nmanner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,\n\nare deemed waived.\").\n\n                  V. Identification of Ayala and Ortíz\n\n            Petty Officer Roberts testified that on April 28, 2001,\nhe detained four people on the South Salinas Finger.           Rather than\n\nidentify those individuals in court, or testify to an out-of-court\nidentification pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(C),\nRoberts simply stated that he recognized four photographs the\n\nprosecutor displayed to him as having been taken on April 28 in his\npresence.12 Although appellants acknowledge that the thrust of this\ntestimony was that the individuals in the photographs were the\n\npersons arrested on April 28 on the South Salinas Finger, they\npoint     out   that   Petty   Officer    Roberts   never   identified   the\nindividuals in the photographs.          Instead, the prosecutor submitted\n\nthe photographs to the court, with the explanation that \"Government\nExhibit 9 is the photograph of Rafael Ayala-Ayala; No. 10 is that\nof Defendant Armando Torres-Ortiz.\"          The district court overruled\n\nappellants' objection to the prosecutor's explanation.\n\n\n     12\n        Petty Officer Roberts himself appeared in the photographs\nof Ayala and Ortíz.\n\n                                    -15-\n\f             Ayala and Ortíz argued in their Rule 29 motion that there\n\nwas insufficient evidence to support a finding that they were the\n\nindividuals detained on the South Salinas Finger.13 The court ruled\nthat in-court identification was not required, \"[a]s long as there\n\nis evidence in the record that shows that the person that was\n\narrested is the person that is being accused.\"\n             \"Identification       of   the    defendant         as    the    person    who\n\ncommitted the charged crime is always an essential element which\n\nthe government must establish beyond a reasonable doubt.                         However,\n\nin-court identification by a witness is not necessarily required.\n\n'Identification      can    be     inferred         from     all      the     facts     and\n\ncircumstances that are in evidence.'\" United States v. Alexander,\n\n48 F.3d 1477, 1490 (9th Cir. 1995) (citations omitted) (quoting\nUnited States v. Weed, 689 F.2d 752, 754 (7th Cir. 1982)).                            Petty\n\nOfficer Roberts testified that the individuals he arrested on April\n\n28   on    the   South   Salinas    Finger         were    those      depicted    in    the\nphotographs which the prosecutor submitted to the court.                          At the\n\noutset of the trial defense counsel had indicated to the court that\nshe was appearing \"on behalf of Armando Torres-Ortiz and Rafael\nAyala-Ayala.\"        See   Alexander,         48    F.3d    at     1490      (\"[I]n-court\n\nidentification is not necessary when the defendant's attorney\nhimself identifies his client at trial.\").                       The trial judge was\n\n\n\n      13\n        A heading in appellants' brief includes Rivera among the\nappellants raising the identification issue. The argument under\nthat heading, however, refers only to Ayala and Ortíz.       To the\nextent that Rivera has stated an appeal on this issue, we reject it\nfor the same reasons we reject the appeals of Ayala and Ortíz.\n\n                                        -16-\n\ftherefore in a position to make the necessary identification\n\nfinding based on a visual comparison of the photographs with the\n\ndefendants in the courtroom.                The evidence was sufficient to\nsupport a finding, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendants Ayala\n\nand Ortíz were among those detained on the South Salinas Finger on\n\nApril 28.\n\n                      VI. The Necessity Defense\n\n            Appellants Kennedy and Rivera argue that the district\n\ncourt erred in refusing to permit them to present the defense of\n\nnecessity. Kennedy and Rivera assert that they reasonably believed\nthat entering the Camp García installation was necessary to avert\n\na greater evil, which they characterize as \"the Navy's violation of\nthe procedural and substantive requirements of the Endangered\nSpecies Act [16 U.S.C. § 1531 et seq.] by continuously bombing\n\nVieques without completing or submitting to the United States Fish\nand   Wildlife   Service   .   .   .    a    proper   biological   assessment,\ndetailing the [likely] impact of the bombing on 13 separate species\n\nof endangered or threatened animals and [plants] in the Vieques\narea and the attendant harm to the species.\"             We review a decision\nto bar presentation of a specific defense at trial de novo.             United\n\nStates v. Maxwell, 254 F.3d 21, 26 (1st Cir. 2001).\n            \"The necessity defense requires the defendant[s] to show\nthat [they] (1) [were] faced with a choice of evils and chose the\n\nlesser evil, (2) acted to prevent imminent harm, (3) reasonably\nanticipated a direct causal relationship between [their] acts and\n\nthe harm to be averted, and (4) had no legal alternative but to\n\n                                       -17-\n\fviolate the law.\"           Id. at 27.      Before putting on a necessity\n\ndefense, however, an initial hurdle must be cleared: if a \"proffer\n\nin support of an anticipated [necessity] defense is insufficient as\na matter of law to create a triable issue, a district court may\n\npreclude the presentation of that defense entirely.\"                Id. at 26.\n\n          We    need    not    address     the   sufficiency   of   appellants'\nproffer on the first two elements of the necessity defense because\n\nwe conclude that they failed to establish the third and fourth\n\nelements of the defense.          Appellants were required to show that\n\nthey \"reasonably anticipated a direct causal relationship between\n\n[their] acts and the harm to be averted.\"              Id. at 27.     They argue\n\nthat because    it     is   the   Navy's    practice   to   suspend    live-fire\n\nexercises when civilians are spotted in the area, it was reasonable\nfor them to have believed that their presence on Vieques would\n\ncause at least a temporary suspension of the exercises.                 However,\n\nwe rejected a similar necessity defense advanced in another Vieques\ntrespassing case, observing that \"[a]ppellants offered no evidence\n\nto support their claim that their trespassory protests will result\n\nin a change of U.S. Naval policy so that the bombing and ammunition\n\ntesting in Vieques will cease.\" United States v. Sued-Jiménez, 275\n\nF.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2001).         In short, there is not a direct causal\n\nrelationship between the trespassing and the harm to be averted,\n\nbeyond the sort of \"temporary cessation\" of the bombing that we\n\nhave found insufficient to support a necessity defense.                 Id.\n\n          Nor    have       Kennedy   and    Rivera    exhausted      all   legal\n\nalternatives to violating the law.               We have observed that \"the\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\fdecided cases teach that a defendant's legal alternatives will\n\nrarely, if ever, be deemed exhausted when the harm of which he\n\ncomplains can be palliated by political action.\" Maxwell, 254 F.3d\nat 29.    Appellants submit that the district court's failure to act\n\non their demand for a preliminary injunction barring military\n\nexercises on Vieques indicates that they had no legal alternative\nto   engaging   in   civil    disobedience.14     There   are,   however,\n\ninnumerable forms of political and legal action that Kennedy and\n\nRivera could have undertaken in pursuit of their objective of\n\nstopping the bombing on Vieques.       See Maxwell, 254 F.3d at 28-29.\n\nWhile legally sanctioned forms of activism might not have achieved\n\nan immediate halt to the military exercises, \"appellants cannot\n\nclaim they have no legal alternatives merely because their law-\nabiding efforts are unlikely to effect a change in policy as soon\n\nas they would like.\"         Sued-Jiménez, 275 F.3d at 7. A contrary\n\nholding \"would be tantamount to giving an individual carte blanche\nto interpose a necessity defense whenever he becomes disaffected by\n\nthe workings of the political process.\"         Maxwell, 254 F.3d at 29.\n\n\n\n\n     14\n         That demand was made in a lawsuit filed by Water Keeper\nAlliance, of which appellants Kennedy and Rivera are members, in\nOctober of 2000. As of April 28, 2001, the district court had not\nacted on the demand for a preliminary injunction. See Water Keeper\nAlliance v. United States Dept. of Def., 152 F. Supp. 2d 155\n(D.P.R. 2001). Appellant Kennedy is also an attorney for Water\nKeeper Alliance.    The district court denied the motion for a\npreliminary injunction in June of 2001, and we affirmed that denial\nin November of 2001. See Water Keeper Alliance v. United States\nDept. of Def., 271 F.3d 21 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n                                   -19-\n\f               VII. Recusal of the District Court Judge\n\n            Kennedy and Rivera appeal the district court judge's\n\ndenial of their motion that he recuse himself from the case.            Under\n\n28 U.S.C. § 455(a), a federal judge \"shall disqualify himself in\n\nany proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be\n\nquestioned.\"     They argue that because the judge had presided over\n\na lawsuit seeking to halt the bombing exercises on Vieques that was\n\nfiled by the Water Keeper Alliance, an organization of which\n\nKennedy and Rivera were members and for whom Kennedy was an\n\nattorney,   \"a    reasonable    observer      could   conclude   that   [his]\nimpartiality     in   the   criminal   case    was    compromised.\"15     The\n\nallegation is not one of actual bias, but rather that an appearance\nof partiality existed.       See United States v. Snyder, 235 F.3d 42,\n\n45 (1st Cir. 2000) (28 U.S.C. § 455 \"forbids not only the reality\n\nof partiality but its objective appearance as well\").            Kennedy and\nRivera suggest that recusal is in order \"when participants in a\ncivil case . . . become criminal defendants before the same judge,\n\naccused, in essence, of attempting to obtain by 'self-help' the\nrelief they had sought to obtain . . . in the civil action.\"16             We\n\n\n     15\n       See supra at note 14 for the history of the Water Keeper\nlitigation.\n     16\n         In the view of Kennedy and Rivera, the recusal issue is\nlinked to the necessity defense. Kennedy and Rivera argue that\nrecusal was required because \"an objective person . . . could\nreasonably perceive one of the factual elements of [the necessity]\ndefense -- . . . Kennedy and Rivera'[s] belief that [the] Court's\nfailure to rule on their preliminary injunction motion prior to the\nbombing on April 27, 2001 left them with no alternative but to\nenter [Camp García] in order to stop [the] bombing -- to be an\naffront to the Court's authority in the civil case.\"\n\n                                   -20-\n\freview the refusal of a trial judge to recuse himself for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.   Id. at 46.\n\n           We discern no abuse of discretion in the district court\njudge's   decision   not    to   recuse    himself.   We   have   said   that\n\ndisqualification is appropriate when \"the facts asserted provide\n\nwhat an objective, knowledgeable member of the public would find to\nbe a reasonable basis for doubting the judge's impartiality.\"              In\n\nre Boston's Children First, 244 F.3d 164, 167 (1st Cir. 2001)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).         \"Prior judicial exposure to a\n\ndefendant or defendants, without more, is . . . not enough [to\n\nestablish bias].\" United States v. Parrilla Bonilla, 626 F.2d 177,\n\n180 (1st Cir. 1980).       Kennedy and Rivera made no showing that the\n\ndistrict court judge's impartiality could reasonably be questioned.\nWe therefore conclude that the judge did not abuse his discretion\n\nin declining to recuse himself.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\f",

Unpersuaded by their arguments on appeal, we affirm their convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 28, 2001, appellants participated in a campaign of civil disobedience aimed at disrupting live-fire artillery and bombardment exercises which the Navy periodically conducts in and around Vieques. Each was charged with violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1382 (barring entry \"upon any military, naval, or Coast Guard reservation, post, fort, arsenal, yard, station, or installation, for any purpose prohibited by law or lawful regulation\"). The four cases (along with four others) were consolidated for trial in the district court on July 6, 2001.

Kennedy and Rivera argue that the district court judge erred in refusing to permit them to put on a defense of necessity, and in not recusing himself from the case. We address these issues in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

Having been brought before a magistrate approximately 51 hours after their initial detention, Ayala and Ort&#237;z argue that the district court erred in denying their motion to dismiss the informations against them on that ground. We review the district court's construction of Rule 5(a) and the Fourth Amendment de novo, and its factual determinations for clear error. <i>United</i> <i>States v.

Appellants were detained by military personnel at approximately 11:20 a.m. on April 28 and transported to a detention/processing center at Camp Garc&#237;a (on Vieques), where they were searched, questioned, and photographed. The next morning appellants were transported by boat to Roosevelt Roads, a naval installation on the main island of Puerto Rico, where they were again searched, questioned, and photographed. \"Late on Sunday night,\" April 29, appellants were moved to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Guaynabo.

Based upon the extraordinary demands fixed by the large number of arrestees brought over from Vieques Island, the time elapsed was not unreasonable.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, in denying the motion to dismiss, the district court said that 181 individuals had been arrested in the \"wave\" of trespassers which included Ayala and Ort&#237;z, and that the large number of detainees, and the transportation required to get them before a magistrate, constituted \"extraordinary circumstances\" that warranted an exception to the 48-hour rule. The district court was entitled to take judicial notice of the 181 arrests, a circumstance readily ascertainable by the district court. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 201(b)(2) (authorizing judicial notice of facts \"capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned\"). Although the relevant facts in the record are regrettably sparse, the district court concluded correctly that over 100 civil disobedience arrests at a naval base on an island off the coast of Puerto Rico, executed in the midst of a military exercise, constitute an extraordinary circumstance sufficient to justify the slight delay beyond 48 hours in bringing Ayala and Ort&#237;z before a magistrate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Encarnac&#237;on,</i> we reserved the question \"whether Rule 5(a) can ever be a basis for dismissal of an indictment absent evidence of unwarranted interrogation during the period of detention.\" 239 F.3d at 400 n. 5. Without now deciding that question, we also note the absence in this case of any claim of prejudice arising out of appellants' detention beyond 48 hours.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. The Informations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The informations charged that Ayala and Ort&#237;z had entered onto \"lands reserved for the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States\" in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1382, which provides for punishment of \"[w]hoever, within the jurisdiction of the United States, goes upon any military, naval, or Coast Guard reservation, post, fort, arsenal, yard, station, or installation, for any purpose prohibited by law or lawful regulation.\" Ayala and Ort&#237;z moved under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29 for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the prosecution's case, arguing, inter alia, that the piece of land on which they were arrested, the South Salinas Finger, is not \"reserved for the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States,\" as the informations allege. In their view, the South Salinas Finger is not part of a \"military, naval, or Coast Guard reservation,\" but instead is \"submerged land[]\" which has been placed \"under the control of the government of Puerto Rico\" pursuant to 48 U.S.C. &#167; 749. Our review of the district court's denial of a Rule 29 motion is de novo. <i>United States v. Frigerio-Migiano,</i> 254 F.3d 30, 33 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with Ayala and Ort&#237;z that the government failed to prove that the South Salinas Finger is encompassed within the boundaries of the Camp Garc&#237;a naval reservation proper. Petty Officer Larry Werner Roberts II described the South Salinas Finger as \"a little island on the south\" side of Vieques. He testified that \"[i]t has a little land that connects the beach to the island,\" a natural bridge of approximately 35 feet.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> However, a line on the map the prosecution offered into evidence depicting the ordinary high-tide line at Vieques &#8212; the boundary of the Navy's holdings &#8212; does not encompass the location of the South Salinas Finger. Instead, the portion of the map that corresponds to its location is blank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the line on the Navy's map marking the mean high-tide line around Camp Garc&#237;a does not depict the South Salinas Finger, Ayala and Ort&#237;z argue that it must therefore be among Puerto Rico's \"submerged lands,\" which are \"under the control of the government of Puerto Rico.\" 48 U.S.C. &#167; 749.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The statute defines \"control\" to include \"all right, title and interest in and to and jurisdiction and authority over the submerged lands underlying the harbor areas and navigable streams and bodies of water in and around the island of Puerto Rico and the adjacent islands and waters.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 749(3). Ayala and Ort&#237;z assert that the South Salinas Finger \"is a classic example of submerged coastal [lands] over which `all right, title and interest in and to and jurisdiction and authority' has been placed in the hands of Puerto Rico\" (quoting 48 U.S.C. &#167; 749(3)), and that their venture onto the South Salinas Finger thus could not have been an entrance onto lands \"reserved for the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States,\" as the informations allege.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, Ayala and Ort&#237;z have a point. Because the government failed to prove that the South Salinas Finger is above the mean high-tide line, we must accept the proposition in this case that it is indeed \"submerged land[]\" placed \"under the control of the government of Puerto Rico\" by 48 U.S.C. &#167; 749. Such submerged lands are not \"<i>reserved</i> for the <i>exclusive</i> jurisdiction of the United States,\" as the informations allege. However, \"[c]onvictions generally have been sustained as long as the proof upon which they are based corresponds to an offense that was clearly set out in the indictment. A part of the indictment unnecessary to and independent of the allegations of the offense proved may normally be treated as a useless averment that may be ignored.\" <i>United States v. Miller,</i> 471 U.S. 130, 136, 105 S.Ct. 1811, 85 L.Ed.2d 99 (1985) (internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, \"[s]urplusage in an indictment need not be proved.\" <i>United States v. McVeigh,</i> 153 F.3d 1166, 1196 (10th Cir.1998). The phrase \"on lands reserved for the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States\" is surplusage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> If we disregard it, the informations still charge unmistakably that Ayala and Ort&#237;z knowingly and unlawfully entered the Camp Garc&#237;a Naval Installation in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1382.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's proof at trial established this unlawful entry. In <i>United States v. Ventura-Mel&#233;ndez,</i> another Vieques trespassing case, we held that \"`government ownership of the property in question is not a requisite to violating Section 1382.'\" 275 F.3d 9, 16 (1st Cir.2001) (quoting <i>United States v. Allen,</i> 924 F.2d 29, 31 (2d Cir.1991)). Instead, a conviction under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1382 \"requires only that the government demonstrate either a possessory interest in, or occupation or control of, the area reserved by the military.\" <i>Id.</i> at 17. Applying that rule to the installation on Vieques, we held that a portion of \"the area beyond the mean high-tide lines [was] under the occupation and control of the Navy for purposes of &#167; 1382\" because \"a large swath of area extending beyond the shoreline of the beach was permissibly designated as part of a `danger zone' by federal regulation\" and therefore was subject to Navy occupation and control. <i>Id.</i> at 17 (citing 33 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 334.2, 334.1480). We explained that \"Puerto Rico's jurisdiction over the shoreline was established subject to the control of the United States.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was uncontested evidence at trial that the South Salinas Finger, the land on which Ayala and Ort&#237;z were found, was located inside a \"danger zone\" established by federal regulation. <i>See</i> 33 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 334.2, 334.1470. A \"danger zone\" is \"[a] defined water area ... used for target practice, bombing, rocket firing or other especially hazardous operations, normally for the armed forces,\" and \"may be closed to the public on a full-time or intermittent basis, as stated in the regulations.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> 33 C.F.R. &#167; 334.2(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ayala and Ort&#237;z counter that they were not charged with violating 33 C.F.R. &#167; 334.1470 (barring entry into a danger zone), but rather 32 C.F.R. &#167; 770.40 (barring entry onto \"U.S. Naval installations and properties\"). However, we held in <i>Ventura-Mel&#233;ndez,</i> 275 F.3d at 16-18, that the language of &#167; 1382, which on its face is limited to \"[w]hoever ... goes upon any military, naval, or Coast Guard reservation, post, fort, arsenal, yard, station, or installation,\" also extends to those who enter into a danger zone in proximity to a reservation, post, fort, arsenal, yard, station, or installation. That being so, the distinction Ayala and Ort&#237;z advance, between entering a danger zone and entering a naval installation, is without significance in this context.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Notice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1382 bars entry into a military installation \"for any purpose prohibited by law or lawful regulation.\" To establish a prohibited purpose, the informations cited 32 C.F.R. &#167; 770.40, which provides that \"[a]ny person entering or remaining on U.S. Naval installations and properties in Puerto Rico, without the advance consent of [enumerated officials], shall be ... subject to the penalties prescribed by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1382.\" This reliance on the regulation is consistent with our holding in <i>United States v. Parrilla Bonilla,</i> 648 F.2d 1373, 1377 (1st Cir.1981), that \"the requisite prohibited `purpose' under section 1382 can consist of unauthorized entry itself.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have said that \"when a section 1382 prosecution proceeds on the basis that the defendant has entered a restricted military reservation `for the purpose of' unauthorized entry, ... it must be shown that the defendant had knowledge or notice that such entry was, in fact, prohibited.\" <i>Id.</i> In the case of the regulation establishing the danger zone at issue in <i>Ventura-Mel&#233;ndez,</i> the regulation itself states that \"[n]o person or vessel shall enter or remain within the restricted areas at any time unless on official business.\" &#167; 334.1480(b). The regulation establishing the danger zone at issue in this case, however, stipulates that \"[i]t will be open to navigation at all times except when firing is being conducted. At such times, no persons ... shall enter or remain within the danger area.\" &#167; 334.1470(b)(1). To prove a violation of &#167; 1382, then, the government was required to demonstrate that notice was given that the danger zone was closed to the public at the time of the arrests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was testimony to that effect at trial. Lieutenant Commander Russell Gottfried indicated that notice of imminent military activities within the danger zone had been given in the form of a fishermen's notice that was distributed around Vieques a week in advance of the exercises. In addition to the fishermen's notice, Gottfried testified that a temporary security zone was established to prevent intrusions into the danger zone during the live-fire exercises, and that he heard notice of the security zone broadcast over marine band radio \"several times a day in the course of the operations.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> In the Navy's view, these broadcasts supplied additional notice that entry into the danger zone &#8212; and thus onto the South Salinas Finger &#8212; was prohibited.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although there are two vague references to lack of notice in their brief, Ayala and Ort&#237;z do not make a developed mens rea argument to the effect that they personally lacked knowledge or notice of the exclusion of the public from the South Salinas Finger. The two references appear in the section of the brief challenging the government's failure to prove that appellants were found on land \"reserved for the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.\" There Ayala and Ort&#237;z assert that \"the Navy had taken no action to warn others that it considered [the South Salinas Finger] part of its <i>exclusive</i> domain in Vieques\" (emphasis added). This statement is explicitly linked to the exclusive jurisdiction argument that we have rejected. They subsequently add that the land was \"in no way posted or otherwise identified to the public as part of Camp Garc&#237;a or land controlled by the Navy.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> This unelaborated reference to inadequate notice falls far short of a developed argument that the government's proof did not satisfy the mens rea element of &#167; 1382. To the extent that there is a mens rea claim lurking in the exclusive jurisdiction argument of Ayala and Ort&#237;z, we deem it waived. <i>See United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (\"Issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. Identification of Ayala and Ort&#237;z</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petty Officer Roberts testified that on April 28, 2001, he detained four people on the South Salinas Finger. Rather than identify those individuals in court, or testify to an out-of-court identification pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(C), Roberts simply stated that he recognized four photographs the prosecutor displayed to him as having been taken on April 28 in his presence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Although appellants acknowledge that the thrust of this testimony was that the individuals in the photographs were the persons arrested on April 28 on the South Salinas Finger, they point out that Petty Officer Roberts never identified the individuals in the photographs. Instead, the prosecutor submitted the photographs to the court, with the explanation that \"Government Exhibit 9 is the photograph of Rafael Ayala-Ayala; No. 10 is that of Defendant Armando Torres-Ortiz.\" The district court overruled appellants' objection to the prosecutor's explanation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ayala and Ort&#237;z argued in their Rule 29 motion that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that they were the individuals detained on the South Salinas Finger.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> The court ruled that in-court identification was not required, \"[a]s long as there is evidence in the record that shows that the person that was arrested is the person that is being accused.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Identification of the defendant as the person who committed the charged crime is always an essential element which the government must establish beyond a reasonable doubt. However, in-court identification by a witness is not necessarily required. `Identification can be inferred from all the facts and circumstances that are in evidence.'\" <i>United States v. Alexander,</i> 48 F.3d 1477, 1490 (9th Cir.1995) (citations omitted) (quoting <i>United States v. Weed,</i> 689 F.2d 752, 754 (7th Cir.1982)). Petty Officer Roberts testified that the individuals he arrested on April 28 on the South Salinas Finger were those depicted in the photographs which the prosecutor submitted to the court. At the outset of the trial defense counsel had indicated to the court that she was appearing \"on behalf of Armando Torres-Ortiz and Rafael Ayala-Ayala.\" <i>See Alexander,</i> 48 F.3d at 1490 (\"[I]n-court identification is not necessary when the defendant's attorney himself identifies his client at trial.\"). The trial judge was therefore in a position to make the necessary identification finding based on a visual comparison of the photographs with the defendants in the courtroom. The evidence was sufficient to support a finding, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendants Ayala and Ort&#237;z were among those detained on the South Salinas Finger on April 28.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI. The Necessity Defense</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants Kennedy and Rivera argue that the district court erred in refusing to permit them to present the defense of necessity. Kennedy and Rivera assert that they reasonably believed that entering the Camp Garc&#237;a installation was necessary to avert a greater evil, which they characterize as \"the Navy's violation of the procedural and substantive requirements of the Endangered Species Act [16 U.S.C. &#167; 1531 et seq.] by continuously bombing Vieques without completing or submitting to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service ... a proper biological assessment, detailing the [likely] impact of the bombing on 13 separate species of endangered or threatened animals and [plants] in the Vieques area and the attendant harm to the species.\" We review a decision to bar presentation of a specific defense at trial de novo. <i>United States v. Maxwell,</i> 254 F.3d 21, 26 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The necessity defense requires the defendant[s] to show that [they] (1) [were] faced with a choice of evils and chose the lesser evil, (2) acted to prevent imminent harm, (3) reasonably anticipated a direct causal relationship between [their] acts and the harm to be averted, and (4) had no legal alternative but to violate the law.\" <i>Id.</i> at 27. Before putting on a necessity defense, however, an initial hurdle must be cleared: if a \"proffer in support of an anticipated [necessity] defense is insufficient as a matter of law to create a triable issue, a district court may preclude the presentation of that defense entirely.\" <i>Id.</i> at 26.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not address the sufficiency of appellants' proffer on the first two elements of the necessity defense because we conclude that they failed to establish the third and fourth elements of the defense. Appellants were required to show that they \"reasonably anticipated a direct causal relationship between [their] acts and the harm to be averted.\" <i>Id.</i> at 27. They argue that because it is the Navy's practice to suspend live-fire exercises when civilians are spotted in the area, it was reasonable for them to have believed that their presence on Vieques would cause at least a temporary suspension of the exercises. However, we rejected a similar necessity defense advanced in another Vieques trespassing case, observing that \"[a]ppellants offered no evidence to support their claim that their trespassory protests will result in a change of U.S. Naval policy so that the bombing and ammunition testing in Vieques will cease.\" <i>United States v. Sued-Jim&#233;nez,</i> 275 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2001). In short, there is not a direct causal relationship between the trespassing and the harm to be averted, beyond the sort of \"temporary cessation\" of the bombing that we have found insufficient to support a necessity defense. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor have Kennedy and Rivera exhausted all legal alternatives to violating the law. We have observed that \"the decided cases teach that a defendant's legal alternatives will rarely, if ever, be deemed exhausted when the harm of which he complains can be palliated by political action.\" <i>Maxwell,</i> 254 F.3d at 29. Appellants submit that the district court's failure to act on their demand for a preliminary injunction barring military exercises on Vieques indicates that they had no legal alternative to engaging in civil disobedience.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> There are, however, innumerable forms of political and legal action that Kennedy and Rivera could have undertaken in pursuit of their objective of stopping the bombing on Vieques. <i>See Maxwell,</i> 254 F.3d at 28-29. While legally sanctioned forms of activism might not have achieved an <i>immediate</i> halt to the military exercises, \"appellants cannot claim they have no legal alternatives merely because their law-abiding efforts are unlikely to effect a change in policy as soon as they would like.\" <i>Sued-Jim&#233;nez,</i> 275 F.3d at 7. A contrary holding \"would be tantamount to giving an individual carte blanche to interpose a necessity defense whenever he becomes disaffected by the workings of the political process.\" <i>Maxwell,</i> 254 F.3d at 29.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VII. Recusal of the District Court Judge</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kennedy and Rivera appeal the district court judge's denial of their motion that he recuse himself from the case. Under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 455(a), a federal judge \"shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\" They argue that because the judge had presided over a lawsuit seeking to halt the bombing exercises on Vieques that was filed by the Water Keeper Alliance, an organization of which Kennedy and Rivera were members and for whom Kennedy was an attorney, \"a reasonable observer could conclude that [his] impartiality in the criminal case was compromised.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> The allegation is not one of actual bias, but rather that an appearance of partiality existed. <i>See United States v. Snyder,</i> 235 F.3d 42, 45 (1st Cir.2000) (28 U.S.C. &#167; 455 \"forbids not only the reality of partiality but its objective appearance as well\"). Kennedy and Rivera suggest that recusal is in order \"when participants in a civil case ... become criminal defendants before the same judge, accused, in essence, of attempting to obtain by `self-help' the relief they had sought to obtain ... in the civil action.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> We review the refusal of a trial judge to recuse himself for abuse of discretion. <i>Id.</i> at 46.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discern no abuse of discretion in the district court judge's decision not to recuse himself. We have said that disqualification is appropriate when \"the facts asserted provide what an objective, knowledgeable member of the public would find to be a reasonable basis for doubting the judge's impartiality.\" <i>In re Boston's Children First,</i> 244 F.3d 164, 167 (1st Cir. 2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). \"Prior judicial exposure to a defendant or defendants, without more, is ... not enough [to establish bias].\" <i>United States v. Parrilla Bonilla,</i> 626 F.2d 177, 180 (1st Cir.1980). Kennedy and Rivera made no showing that the district court judge's impartiality could reasonably be questioned. We therefore conclude that the judge did not abuse his discretion in declining to recuse himself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> On the interaction of Rule 5(a) and the Fourth Amendment, we have observed that \"[w]hile the Rule 5(a) and Fourth Amendment contexts are certainly analogous, the 48-hours rule is a requirement of the Fourth Amendment, not Rule 5(a).\"<i>United States v. Encarnac&#237;on,</i> 239 F.3d 395, 398 n. 2 (1st Cir.2001) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In<i>United States v. Salivas-Gonz&#225;lez,</i> 147 F.Supp.2d 58 (D.P.R.2001), a case arising out of the same Vieques protest, Judge Fust&#233; ruled that delays in excess of 48 hours in taking detainees before a magistrate were justified by extraordinary circumstances. This is presumably the opinion the government had in mind in its motion to dismiss, which cited a \"Memorandum Order by Judge Jos&#233; Antonio Fust&#233;, dated June 1, 2001\" (same date as <i>Salivas-Gonz&#225;lez</i>). Judge Fust&#233; gave a detailed explanation of the circumstances which he deemed extraordinary:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The logistics entailed by the Navy arrest and processing, and the eventual civil processing and transportation of the arrestees to the metropolitan area was not a simple task. The majority of Deputy U.S. Marshals available had been previously assigned to secure the perimeters within the naval base at Camp Garc&#237;a, leaving a small number of Deputy U.S. Marshals available for the processing of arrestees. Thus, special consideration should be given to:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(a) the limited transportation means between Vieques and Puerto Rico;</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(b) the burdensome conditions being faced by the U.S. Marshals (limited available personnel to arrest, process, and transport over one-hundred arrestees, while still meeting security requirements);</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(c) the large number of violent incidents being reported (which excluded the possibility of assigning a judicial officer to conduct initial proceedings to any other place than secure/court premises)....</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">[U]pon receiving notice that the U.S. Marshals did not have sufficient personnel to escort over one-hundred arrestees to court, arrangements were made to hold the initial appearances at MDC-Guaynabo, the most logical place that could accommodate the large number of people to be handled. All regular visits to MDC had to be canceled by the Bureau of Prisons. Equipment was gathered for use, such as copy machines and faxes. Personnel was assigned to process the individuals, including two magistrates, two courtroom deputy clerks, two interpreters, and various other court employees. A system had to be devised between the Clerk's Office and MDC to coordinate bond, bond setting and taking of the bond monies.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 61-62 (footnote omitted).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Although Roberts described the South Salinas Finger as an \"island,\" the government says that it is a peninsula. The evidence, however, did not establish whether, at high tide, the South Salinas Finger is connected to Vieques by land.

Unpersuaded by their arguments on appeal, we affirm their convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 28, 2001, appellants participated in a campaign of civil disobedience aimed at disrupting live-fire artillery and bombardment exercises which the Navy periodically conducts in and around Vieques. Each was charged with violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1382 (barring entry \"upon any military, naval, or Coast Guard reservation, post, fort, arsenal, yard, station, or installation, for any purpose prohibited by law or lawful regulation\"). The four cases (along with four others) were consolidated for trial in the district court on July 6, 2001. Appellants were convicted and sentenced to thirty days' imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Ayala and Ort&#237;z argue that the informations against them should have been dismissed because the government failed to take them before a magistrate within 48 hours of their arrest; that the government did not prove that they had entered onto a naval installation in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1382; and that the evidence at trial was insufficient to establish that they were among the individuals detained on Vieques on April 28, 2001. Kennedy and Rivera argue that the district court judge erred in refusing to permit them to put on a defense of necessity, and in not recusing himself from the case. We address these issues in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. The 48-Hour Rule</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 5(a) states, in pertinent part, that \"any person making an arrest without a warrant shall take the arrested person without unnecessary delay before the nearest available federal magistrate judge.\" Although Rule 5(a) does not specify what would constitute an \"unnecessary delay,\" courts have construed the Fourth Amendment as imposing a presumptive 48-hour time limit on detentions in the absence of a probable cause determination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> \"Where an arrested individual does not receive a probable cause determination within 48 hours,\" the burden is on the government \"to demonstrate the existence of a bona fide emergency or other extraordinary circumstance.\" <i>County of Riverside v.

Having been brought before a magistrate approximately 51 hours after their initial detention, Ayala and Ort&#237;z argue that the district court erred in denying their motion to dismiss the informations against them on that ground. We review the district court's construction of Rule 5(a) and the Fourth Amendment de novo, and its factual determinations for clear error. <i>United</i> <i>States v. Encarnac&#237;on,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199276\"><a href=\"/opinion/199276/united-states-v-encarnacion/\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">395</span></a></span>, 397 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ayala and Ort&#237;z's motion to dismiss asserted the following facts, which the government has not disputed. Appellants were detained by military personnel at approximately 11:20 a.m. on April 28 and transported to a detention/processing center at Camp Garc&#237;a (on Vieques), where they were searched, questioned, and photographed. The next morning appellants were transported by boat to Roosevelt Roads, a naval installation on the main island of Puerto Rico, where they were again searched, questioned, and photographed. \"Late on Sunday night,\" April 29, appellants were moved to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Guaynabo. Some time after 2:00 p.m. on April 30, Ayala and Ort&#237;z were taken before a magistrate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government filed a cursory response: \"The motion is without merit. It has been rejected by the sections of this Court considering this issue. See e.g. Memorandum Order by Judge Jos&#233; Antonio Fust&#233;, dated June 1, 2001, in the case of <i>United States v. Cecilio Lebron,</i> #01-330.

The district court was entitled to take judicial notice of the 181 arrests, a circumstance readily ascertainable by the district court. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 201(b)(2) (authorizing judicial notice of facts \"capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned\"). Although the relevant facts in the record are regrettably sparse, the district court concluded correctly that over 100 civil disobedience arrests at a naval base on an island off the coast of Puerto Rico, executed in the midst of a military exercise, constitute an extraordinary circumstance sufficient to justify the slight delay beyond 48 hours in bringing Ayala and Ort&#237;z before a magistrate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Encarnac&#237;on,</i> we reserved the question \"whether Rule 5(a) can ever be a basis for dismissal of an indictment absent evidence of unwarranted interrogation during the period of detention.\" 239 F.3d at 400 n. 5. Without now deciding that question, we also note the absence in this case of any claim of prejudice arising out of appellants' detention beyond 48 hours.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. The Informations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The informations charged that Ayala and Ort&#237;z had entered onto \"lands reserved for the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States\" in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1382, which provides for punishment of \"[w]hoever, within the jurisdiction of the United States, goes upon any military, naval, or Coast Guard reservation, post, fort, arsenal, yard, station, or installation, for any purpose prohibited by law or lawful regulation.\" Ayala and Ort&#237;z moved under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29 for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the prosecution's case, arguing, inter alia, that the piece of land on which they were arrested, the South Salinas Finger, is not \"reserved for the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States,\" as the informations allege. In their view, the South Salinas Finger is not part of a \"military, naval, or Coast Guard reservation,\" but instead is \"submerged land[]\" which has been placed \"under the control of the government of Puerto Rico\" pursuant to 48 U.S.C. &#167; 749. Our review of the district court's denial of a Rule 29 motion is de novo. <i>United States v. Frigerio-Migiano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199477\"><a href=\"/opinion/199477/united-states-v-frigerio-migiano/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 33 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with Ayala and Ort&#237;z that the government failed to prove that the South Salinas Finger is encompassed within the boundaries of the Camp Garc&#237;a naval reservation proper. Petty Officer Larry Werner Roberts II described the South Salinas Finger as \"a little island on the south\" side of Vieques. He testified that \"[i]t has a little land that connects the beach to the island,\" a natural bridge of approximately 35 feet.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> However, a line on the map the prosecution offered into evidence depicting the ordinary high-tide line at Vieques &#8212; the boundary of the Navy's holdings &#8212; does not encompass the location of the South Salinas Finger. Instead, the portion of the map that corresponds to its location is blank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the line on the Navy's map marking the mean high-tide line around Camp Garc&#237;a does not depict the South Salinas Finger, Ayala and Ort&#237;z argue that it must therefore be among Puerto Rico's \"submerged lands,\" which are \"under the control of the government of Puerto Rico.\" 48 U.S.C. &#167; 749.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The statute defines \"control\" to include \"all right, title and interest in and to and jurisdiction and authority over the submerged lands underlying the harbor areas and navigable streams and bodies of water in and around the island of Puerto Rico and the adjacent islands and waters.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 749(3). Ayala and Ort&#237;z assert that the South Salinas Finger \"is a classic example of submerged coastal [lands] over which `all right, title and interest in and to and jurisdiction and authority' has been placed in the hands of Puerto Rico\" (quoting 48 U.S.C. &#167; 749(3)), and that their venture onto the South Salinas Finger thus could not have been an entrance onto lands \"reserved for the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States,\" as the informations allege.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, Ayala and Ort&#237;z have a point. Because the government failed to prove that the South Salinas Finger is above the mean high-tide line, we must accept the proposition in this case that it is indeed \"submerged land[]\" placed \"under the control of the government of Puerto Rico\" by 48 U.S.C. &#167; 749. Such submerged lands are not \"<i>reserved</i> for the <i>exclusive</i> jurisdiction of the United States,\" as the informations allege. However, \"[c]onvictions generally have been sustained as long as the proof upon which they are based corresponds to an offense that was clearly set out in the indictment. A part of the indictment unnecessary to and independent of the allegations of the offense proved may normally be treated as a useless averment that may be ignored.\" <i>United States v. Miller,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111404\"><a href=\"/opinion/111404/united-states-v-miller/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span>, 136, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111404\"><a href=\"/opinion/111404/united-states-v-miller/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The phrase \"on lands reserved for the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States\" is surplusage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> If we disregard it, the informations still charge unmistakably that Ayala and Ort&#237;z knowingly and unlawfully entered the Camp Garc&#237;a Naval Installation in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1382.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's proof at trial established this unlawful entry.

Instead, a conviction under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1382 \"requires only that the government demonstrate either a possessory interest in, or occupation or control of, the area reserved by the military.\" <i>Id.</i> at 17. Applying that rule to the installation on Vieques, we held that a portion of \"the area beyond the mean high-tide lines [was] under the occupation and control of the Navy for purposes of &#167; 1382\" because \"a large swath of area extending beyond the shoreline of the beach was permissibly designated as part of a `danger zone' by federal regulation\" and therefore was subject to Navy occupation and control. <i>Id.</i> at 17 (citing 33 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 334.2, 334.1480).

The regulation establishing the danger zone at issue in this case, however, stipulates that \"[i]t will be open to navigation at all times except when firing is being conducted. At such times, no persons ... shall enter or remain within the danger area.\" &#167; 334.1470(b)(1). To prove a violation of &#167; 1382, then, the government was required to demonstrate that notice was given that the danger zone was closed to the public at the time of the arrests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was testimony to that effect at trial. Lieutenant Commander Russell Gottfried indicated that notice of imminent military activities within the danger zone had been given in the form of a fishermen's notice that was distributed around Vieques a week in advance of the exercises. In addition to the fishermen's notice, Gottfried testified that a temporary security zone was established to prevent intrusions into the danger zone during the live-fire exercises, and that he heard notice of the security zone broadcast over marine band radio \"several times a day in the course of the operations.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> In the Navy's view, these broadcasts supplied additional notice that entry into the danger zone &#8212; and thus onto the South Salinas Finger &#8212; was prohibited.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although there are two vague references to lack of notice in their brief, Ayala and Ort&#237;z do not make a developed mens rea argument to the effect that they personally lacked knowledge or notice of the exclusion of the public from the South Salinas Finger. The two references appear in the section of the brief challenging the government's failure to prove that appellants were found on land \"reserved for the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.\" There Ayala and Ort&#237;z assert that \"the Navy had taken no action to warn others that it considered [the South Salinas Finger] part of its <i>exclusive</i> domain in Vieques\" (emphasis added). This statement is explicitly linked to the exclusive jurisdiction argument that we have rejected. They subsequently add that the land was \"in no way posted or otherwise identified to the public as part of Camp Garc&#237;a or land controlled by the Navy.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> This unelaborated reference to inadequate notice falls far short of a developed argument that the government's proof did not satisfy the mens rea element of &#167; 1382.

Identification of Ayala and Ort&#237;z</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petty Officer Roberts testified that on April 28, 2001, he detained four people on the South Salinas Finger. Rather than identify those individuals in court, or testify to an out-of-court identification pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(C), Roberts simply stated that he recognized four photographs the prosecutor displayed to him as having been taken on April 28 in his presence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Although appellants acknowledge that the thrust of this testimony was that the individuals in the photographs were the persons arrested on April 28 on the South Salinas Finger, they point out that Petty Officer Roberts never identified the individuals in the photographs. Instead, the prosecutor submitted the photographs to the court, with the explanation that \"Government Exhibit 9 is the photograph of Rafael Ayala-Ayala; No. 10 is that of Defendant Armando Torres-Ortiz.\" The district court overruled appellants' objection to the prosecutor's explanation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ayala and Ort&#237;z argued in their Rule 29 motion that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that they were the individuals detained on the South Salinas Finger.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> The court ruled that in-court identification was not required, \"[a]s long as there is evidence in the record that shows that the person that was arrested is the person that is being accused.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Identification of the defendant as the person who committed the charged crime is always an essential element which the government must establish beyond a reasonable doubt.

Alexander,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"691023\"><a href=\"/opinion/691023/united-states-v-gary-edward-alexander-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1477</span></a></span>, 1490 (9th Cir.1995) (citations omitted) (quoting <i>United States v.

Petty Officer Roberts testified that the individuals he arrested on April 28 on the South Salinas Finger were those depicted in the photographs which the prosecutor submitted to the court. At the outset of the trial defense counsel had indicated to the court that she was appearing \"on behalf of Armando Torres-Ortiz and Rafael Ayala-Ayala.\" <i>See Alexander,</i> 48 F.3d at 1490 (\"[I]n-court identification is not necessary when the defendant's attorney himself identifies his client at trial.\"). The trial judge was therefore in a position to make the necessary identification finding based on a visual comparison of the photographs with the defendants in the courtroom. The evidence was sufficient to support a finding, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendants Ayala and Ort&#237;z were among those detained on the South Salinas Finger on April 28.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI. The Necessity Defense</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants Kennedy and Rivera argue that the district court erred in refusing to permit them to present the defense of necessity. Kennedy and Rivera assert that they reasonably believed that entering the Camp Garc&#237;a installation was necessary to avert a greater evil, which they characterize as \"the Navy's violation of the procedural and substantive requirements of the Endangered Species Act [16 U.S.C. &#167; 1531 et seq.] by continuously bombing Vieques without completing or submitting to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service ... a proper biological assessment, detailing the [likely] impact of the bombing on 13 separate species of endangered or threatened animals and [plants] in the Vieques area and the attendant harm to the species.\" We review a decision to bar presentation of a specific defense at trial de novo. <i>United States v. Maxwell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199478\"><a href=\"/opinion/199478/united-states-v-maxwell-anthony/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The necessity defense requires the defendant[s] to show that [they] (1) [were] faced with a choice of evils and chose the lesser evil, (2) acted to prevent imminent harm, (3) reasonably anticipated a direct causal relationship between [their] acts and the harm to be averted, and (4) had no legal alternative but to violate the law.\" <i>Id.</i> at 27. Before putting on a necessity defense, however, an initial hurdle must be cleared: if a \"proffer in support of an anticipated [necessity] defense is insufficient as a matter of law to create a triable issue, a district court may preclude the presentation of that defense entirely.\" <i>Id.</i> at 26.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not address the sufficiency of appellants' proffer on the first two elements of the necessity defense because we conclude that they failed to establish the third and fourth elements of the defense. Appellants were required to show that they \"reasonably anticipated a direct causal relationship between [their] acts and the harm to be averted.\" <i>Id.</i> at 27. They argue that because it is the Navy's practice to suspend live-fire exercises when civilians are spotted in the area, it was reasonable for them to have believed that their presence on Vieques would cause at least a temporary suspension of the exercises. However, we rejected a similar necessity defense advanced in another Vieques trespassing case, observing that \"[a]ppellants offered no evidence to support their claim that their trespassory protests will result in a change of U.S. Naval policy so that the bombing and ammunition testing in Vieques will cease.\" <i>United States v. Sued-Jim&#233;nez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775955\"><a href=\"/opinion/775955/united-states-v-jalil-gazir-sued-jimenez-united-states-of-america-v-elga/\"><span class=\"volume\">275</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.2001). In short, there is not a direct causal relationship between the trespassing and the harm to be averted, beyond the sort of \"temporary cessation\" of the bombing that we have found insufficient to support a necessity defense. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor have Kennedy and Rivera exhausted all legal alternatives to violating the law. We have observed that \"the decided cases teach that a defendant's legal alternatives will rarely, if ever, be deemed exhausted when the harm of which he complains can be palliated by political action.\" <i>Maxwell,</i> 254 F.3d at 29. Appellants submit that the district court's failure to act on their demand for a preliminary injunction barring military exercises on Vieques indicates that they had no legal alternative to engaging in civil disobedience.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> There are, however, innumerable forms of political and legal action that Kennedy and Rivera could have undertaken in pursuit of their objective of stopping the bombing on Vieques. <i>See Maxwell,</i> 254 F.3d at 28-29. While legally sanctioned forms of activism might not have achieved an <i>immediate</i> halt to the military exercises, \"appellants cannot claim they have no legal alternatives merely because their law-abiding efforts are unlikely to effect a change in policy as soon as they would like.\" <i>Sued-Jim&#233;nez,</i> 275 F.3d at 7. A contrary holding \"would be tantamount to giving an individual carte blanche to interpose a necessity defense whenever he becomes disaffected by the workings of the political process.\" <i>Maxwell,</i> 254 F.3d at 29.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VII. Recusal of the District Court Judge</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kennedy and Rivera appeal the district court judge's denial of their motion that he recuse himself from the case. Under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 455(a), a federal judge \"shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\" They argue that because the judge had presided over a lawsuit seeking to halt the bombing exercises on Vieques that was filed by the Water Keeper Alliance, an organization of which Kennedy and Rivera were members and for whom Kennedy was an attorney, \"a reasonable observer could conclude that [his] impartiality in the criminal case was compromised.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> The allegation is not one of actual bias, but rather that an appearance of partiality existed. <i>See United States v.

Kennedy and Rivera suggest that recusal is in order \"when participants in a civil case ... become criminal defendants before the same judge, accused, in essence, of attempting to obtain by `self-help' the relief they had sought to obtain ... in the civil action.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> We review the refusal of a trial judge to recuse himself for abuse of discretion. <i>Id.</i> at 46.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discern no abuse of discretion in the district court judge's decision not to recuse himself.

Judge Fust&#233; gave a detailed explanation of the circumstances which he deemed extraordinary:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The logistics entailed by the Navy arrest and processing, and the eventual civil processing and transportation of the arrestees to the metropolitan area was not a simple task. The majority of Deputy U.S. Marshals available had been previously assigned to secure the perimeters within the naval base at Camp Garc&#237;a, leaving a small number of Deputy U.S. Marshals available for the processing of arrestees. Thus, special consideration should be given to:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(a) the limited transportation means between Vieques and Puerto Rico;</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(b) the burdensome conditions being faced by the U.S. Marshals (limited available personnel to arrest, process, and transport over one-hundred arrestees, while still meeting security requirements);</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(c) the large number of violent incidents being reported (which excluded the possibility of assigning a judicial officer to conduct initial proceedings to any other place than secure/court premises)....</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">[U]pon receiving notice that the U.S. Marshals did not have sufficient personnel to escort over one-hundred arrestees to court, arrangements were made to hold the initial appearances at MDC-Guaynabo, the most logical place that could accommodate the large number of people to be handled. All regular visits to MDC had to be canceled by the Bureau of Prisons. Equipment was gathered for use, such as copy machines and faxes. Personnel was assigned to process the individuals, including two magistrates, two courtroom deputy clerks, two interpreters, and various other court employees.

As appellants' entry into the danger zone is sufficient to support their conviction, we need not decide whether entry into the security zone alone in this case violated &#167; 1382.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The security zone is described supra at note 8</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Of course, the broadcasts also served to give notice that entry into the security zone itself was prohibited</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> There is arguably a third, even more oblique reference, to a lack of warning that the South Salinas Finger was off limits to the public. Appellants say that the danger zone created for exercises in Vieques did not warn that violation would result in prosecution. This statement seems to register a complaint about an inadequate warning of the consequences of a violation. Notably, the comment does not suggest a misapprehension about the fact that entry into the danger zone would be a violation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> Petty Officer Roberts himself appeared in the photographs of Ayala and Ort&#237;z</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> A heading in appellants' brief includes Rivera among the appellants raising the identification issue. The argument under that heading, however, refers only to Ayala and Ort&#237;z. To the extent that Rivera has stated an appeal on this issue, we reject it for the same reasons we reject the appeals of Ayala and Ort&#237;z</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> That demand was made in a lawsuit filed by Water Keeper Alliance, of which appellants Kennedy and Rivera are members, in October of 2000. As of April 28, 2001, the district court had not acted on the demand for a preliminary injunction<i>See Water Keeper Alliance v. United States Dept. of Def.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2482859\"><a href=\"/opinion/2482859/water-keeper-alliance-v-usdod/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">155</span></a></span> (D.P.R.2001). Appellant Kennedy is also an attorney for Water Keeper Alliance. The district court denied the motion for a preliminary injunction in June of 2001, and we affirmed that denial in November of 2001. <i>See Water Keeper Alliance v. United States Dept. of Def.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199678\"><a href=\"/opinion/199678/water-keeper-allianc-v-dept-of-defense/\"><span class=\"volume\">271</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> <i>See supra</i> at note 14 for the history of the <i>Water Keeper</i> litigation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> In the view of Kennedy and Rivera, the recusal issue is linked to the necessity defense. Kennedy and Rivera argue that recusal was required because \"an objective person... could reasonably perceive one of the factual elements of [the necessity] defense &#8212; ... Kennedy and Rivera'[s] belief that [the] Court's failure to rule on their preliminary injunction motion prior to the bombing on April 27, 2001 left them with no alternative but to enter [Camp Garc&#237;a] in order to stop [the] bombing &#8212; to be an affront to the Court's authority in the civil case.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
