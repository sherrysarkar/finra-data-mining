The United Kingdom,  on behalf of Hong  Kong,\r\n\nhad  sought Lui's extradition on a warrant for his arrest for\r\n\nthe crime of bribery.   Lui's petition for habeas  corpus was\r\n\npremised on the fact that  the reversion of Hong Kong to  the\r\n\nPeople's Republic of China  will take place on July  1, 1997,\r\n\nand it  will be impossible for the Crown Colony to try and to\r\n\npunish Lui before that date.  The United States  appeals.  We\r\n\nreverse  the order of the district court granting the writ of\r\n\nhabeas corpus.\r\n\n          The  United States  argues that  Lui is  within the\r\n\nliteral terms of the  extradition treaties between the United\r\n\nStates and the United  Kingdom, that the courts may  not vary\r\n\nfrom the language of the treaties, and that the certification\r\n\nmust issue.   Lui argues  that the language  of the  treaties\r\n\ndoes  not permit  extradition,  an argument  which is  surely\r\n\nwrong.   Lui's more serious  argument is that  the Senate, in\r\n\napproving the treaties, did not mean to permit extradition of\r\n\nsomeone to  be tried and  punished by a  government different\r\n\nfrom the  government which has  given its  assurances in  the\r\n\ntreaties.  \r\r\n\n          Lui  does not  claim that  he faces  prosecution in\r\n\nHong Kong on  account of his race, religion,  nationality, or\r\n\npolitical opinion.   He does not  claim to be charged  with a\r\n\npolitical offense.   The treaties give  the courts a  greater\r\n\nrole  when  such considerations  are  present.   Here,  Lui's\r\n\nposture is that of  one charged with an ordinary crime.   His\r\n\nclaim is  that  to surrender  him  now to  Hong  Kong is,  in\r\n\neffect, to send him  to trial and punishment in  the People's\r\n\nRepublic of  China.  The  Senate, in approving  the treaties,\r\n\ncould  not have intended such a result, he argues, and so the\r\n\ncourt should interpret the  treaties as being inapplicable to\r\n\nhis case.  Absent a treaty permitting extradition, he argues,\r\n\nhe may not be extradited.\r\n\n          While Lis it persuasive.  The Senate was well aware\r\n\nof the reversion when it approved a supplementary treaty with\r\n\nthe United Kingdom  in 1986.   The Senate  could easily  have\r\n\nsought language to address  the reversion of Hong Kong  if it\r\n\nwere  concerned,  but  did not  do  so.    The President  has\r\n\nrecently executed  a new treaty with  the incoming government\r\n\nof  Hong Kong, containing the same guarantees that Lui points\r\n\nto  in  the  earlier  treaties,  and  that  treaty  has  been\r\n\nsubmitted  to the  Senate.  In  addition, governments  of our\r\n\ntreaty partners often change, sometimes by  ballot, sometimes\r\n\nby revolution  or other means,  and the  possibility or  even\r\n\ncertainty of  such change  does not itself  excuse compliance\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nwith  the  terms of  the agreement  embodied in  the treaties\r\n\nbetween the countries.  Treaties contain  reciprocal benefits\r\n\nand  obligations.    The  United  States  benefits  from  the\r\n\ntreaties  at   issue  and,   under  their  terms,   may  seek\r\n\nextradition  to the date of  reversion of those  it wants for\r\n\ncriminal offenses.\r\n\n          Fundamental  principles  in our  American democracy\r\n\nlimit the role of courts in certain matters, out of deference\r\n\nto the  powers allocated by the Constitution to the President\r\n\nand to the  Senate, particularly  in the  conduct of  foreign\r\n\nrelations.   Those  separation  of  powers  principles,  well\r\n\nrehearsed in extradition law,  preclude us from rewriting the\r\n\ntreaties which  the President  and the Senate  have approved.\r\n\nThe  plain language  of the  treaties does  not support  Lui.\r\n\nUnder the treaties  as written,  the courts may  not, on  the\r\n\nbasis of the  reversion, avoid certifying to the Secretary of\r\n\nState  that Lui may be  extradited.  The  decision whether to\r\n\nsurrender  Lui,  in  light  of  his  arguments,  is  for  the\r\n\nSecretary of State to make.\r\n\n          This is not to say American courts acting under the\r\n\nwrit of habeas corpus, itself guaranteed in the Constitution,\r\n\nhave no independent  role.  There  is the ultimate  safeguard\r\n\nthat  extradition  proceedings  before  United  States courts\r\n\ncomport  with the Due Process Clause of the Constitution.  On\r\n\nthe facg presenting a  serious constitutional issue of denial\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nof due process.  Some future case may, on  facts amounting to\r\n\na  violation of  constitutional guarantees,  warrant judicial\r\n\nintervention.  This case does not.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n          We repeat  the facts essentially as  we stated them\r\n\nin  our earlier opinion.   United States v.  Lui Kin-Hong, 83\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d 523 (1st Cir. 1996) (reversing district court's decision\r\n\nto release Lui on bail).\r\n\n          Lui  is charged  in  Hong Kong  with conspiring  to\r\n\nreceive and receiving over US $3 million in bribes from Giant\r\n\nIsland  Ltd. (\"GIL\")  or GIL's  subsidiary, Wing  Wah Company\r\n\n(\"WWC\").    Lui, formerly  a senior  officer  of the  Brown &amp;\r\n\nWilliamson  Co., was  \"seconded\"  in 1990  to its  affiliated\r\n\ncompany, the  British American  Tobacco Co. (Hong  Kong) Ltd.\r\n\n(\"BAT-HK\"), where he became Director of Exports in 1992.  The\r\n\ncharges  result  from  an  investigation  by  the  Hong  Kong\r\n\nIndependent Commission Against Corruption (\"ICAC\").  The Hong\r\n\nKong authorities charge  that GIL  and WWC,  to which  BAT-HK\r\n\ndistributed  cigarettes, paid  bribes  in excess  of HK  $100\r\n\nmillion  (approximately US $14 to $15 million) to a series of\r\n\nBAT-HK executives, including Lui.   The bribes were allegedly\r\n\ngiven in exchange  for a  virtual monopoly on  the export  of\r\n\ncertain  brands of  cigarettes  to the  People's Republic  of\r\n\nChina  (\"PRC\")   and  to   Taiwan.    Among   the  cigarettes\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\ndistributed  were the  popular Brown  &amp; Williamson  brands of\r\n\nKent,  Viceroy,  and  Lucky  Strike.   GIL  purchased  three-\r\n\nquarters  of a  billion dollars  in cigarettes  from 1991  to\r\n\n1994, mostly from BAT-HK.\r\n\n           A  former GIL  shareholder, Chui  To-Yan (\"Chui\"),\r\n\ncooperated  with the authorities and, it  is said, would have\r\n\nprovided evidence  of Lui's  acceptance of  bribes.  Some  of\r\n\nLui's alleged co-conspirators attempted to dissuade Chui from\r\n\ncooperating.     Chui  was   later  abducted,  tortured,  and\r\n\nmurdered.  The ICAC  claims that the murder was  committed to\r\n\nstop Chui from testifying.  Lui  is not charged in the murder\r\n\nconspiracy.    Lui  was  in the  Philippines  (which  has  no\r\n\nextradition treaty with  Hong Kong) on  a business trip  when\r\n\nthe Hong  Kong authorities unsuccessfully sought  to question\r\n\nhim in April  1994.  Lui has not returned  to Hong Kong since\r\n\nthen. \r\n\n          At the request of the United Kingdom (\"UK\"), acting\r\n\non behalf of Hong  Kong, United States marshals arrested  Lui\r\n\nas  he got off a plane at  Boston's Logan Airport on December\r\n\n20, 1995.  The arrest was for the  purpose of extraditing Lui\r\n\nto Hong Kong.1   The  government asked that  Lui be  detained\r\n\npending  completion  of  the  extradition proceedings.    The\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The most recent warrant for Lui's arrest from the Hong\r\nKong authorities is dated February 5, 1996; there were\r\nearlier warrants.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nmagistrate judge, after a hearing, denied Lui's request to be\r\n\nreleased on bail.\r\n\n          The district court, on April 25, 1996, reversed the\r\n\norder  of the magistrate judge  and released Lui  on bail and\r\n\nconditions.  Lui Kin-Hong v. United States, 926 F. Supp. 1180\r                                                      \r\n\n(D.  Mass. 1996).  The district court held that the reversion\r\n\nof Hong Kong to the PRC on July 1, 1997, raised complex legal\r\n\nissues  that  would  result  in  protracted  proceedings  and\r\n\npresented a \"special circumstance\" overriding the presumption\r\n\nagainst bail.  Id. at 1189.  That court also found that there\r                              \r\n\nwere conditions of release that would adequately ensure Lui's\r\n\npresence at future  proceedings.   Id. at 1196.   This  court\r                                                  \r\n\nreversed the district court and, on May 14, 1996, ordered Lui\r\n\nheld pending the resolution  of the extradition certification\r\n\nissue.  Lui, 83 F.3d at 525.\r                       \r\n\n          The magistrate judge commenced extradition hearings\r\n\non  May 28, 1996.   Those proceedings,  during which evidence\r\n\nwas  taken, lasted  three days.   The magistrate  judge found\r\n\nthat  there  was  probable  cause  to believe  that  Lui  had\r\n\nviolated Hong Kong law on  all but one of the charges  in the\r\n\nwarrant.2   Magistrate Judge Karol,  pursuant to 18  U.S.C.  \r\n\n3184,    issued   a   careful   decision   certifying   Lui's\r\n\nextraditability on August 29, 1996.  In re Extradition of Lui\r                                                                         \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  The magistrate judge found the government had not met its\r\nburden of showing probable cause as to Count 2, concerning a\r\npayment of HK $1,953,260 made on or about October 21, 1988.\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nKin-Hong  (\"Lui Extradition\"),  939  F. Supp.  934 (D.  Mass.\r                                       \r\n\n1996).  On September  3, 1996, Lui filed an  amended petition\r\n\nfor  a writ  of habeas  corpus, the  only avenue  by which  a\r\n\nfugitive sought for extradition  (a \"relator\") may attack the\r\n\nmagistrate judge's decision,3 with the district court.\r\n\n          After  a  hearing,  the  district  court  issued  a\r\n\nmemorandum and order  granting the writ  on January 7,  1997.\r\n\nLui Kin-Hong v. United States (\"Lui Habeas\"), --- F. Supp. --\r                                                      \r\n\n-,   1997 WL  37477 (D.  Mass. Jan. 7,  1997).   The district\r\n\ncourt reasoned that, because  the Crown Colony could  not try\r\n\nLui and punish him before the reversion date, the extradition\r\n\ntreaty  between  the  United  States and  the  UK,  which  is\r\n\napplicable to Hong Kong, prohibited extradition.  Id. at ---,\r                                                                 \r\n\n*4-*5.   Because  no  extradition treaty  between the  United\r\n\nStates and the new government of Hong Kong has been confirmed\r\n\nby the United States Senate, the district court reasoned, the\r\n\nmagistrate    judge    lacked    jurisdiction   to    certify\r\n\nextraditability.  See id. at ---, *5-*11.  The district court\r                                     \r\n\ndenied the government's motion for reconsideration on January\r\n\n13,  1997.  This court then stayed the district court's order\r\n\nand expedited the present appeal.  \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  Due to the limited function of an extradition proceeding,\r\nthere is no direct appeal from a judicial officer's\r\ncertification of extraditability.  See Collins v. Miller, 252\r                                                                    \r\nU.S. 364, 369-70 (1920).  A habeas petition is therefore the\r\nonly mechanism by which a relator may seek review.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\n          At the time Lui was arrested  in Boston in December\r\n\n1995, more than eighteen months remained before the reversion\r\n\nof  Hong Kong  to  the PRC  on  July 1,  1997.   The  various\r\n\nproceedings in our court system have now occupied fifteen  of\r\n\nthose months, as the magistrate judge and district judge have\r\n\ngiven careful consideration to the issues.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n          The extradition request  was made  pursuant to  the\r\n\nExtradition  Treaty  Between  the  Government  of the  United\r\n\nStates of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of\r\n\nGreat Britain and  Northern Ireland, June 8, 1972,  28 U.S.T.\r\n\n227 (the  \"Treaty\"), as  amended by the  Supplementary Treaty\r\n\nBetween the Government  of the United  States of America  and\r\n\nthe Government  of the  United Kingdom  of Great  Britain and\r\n\nNorthern  Ireland, June  25,  1985, T.I.A.S.

By its terms, the Treaty applies to the UK, and, in\r\naddition, to \"any territory for the international relations\r\nof which the United Kingdom is responsible and to which the\r\nTreaty shall have been extended by agreement between the\r\nContracting Parties embodied in an Exchange of Notes.\" \r\nTreaty, art.

The  impending reversion, at the expiration  of the\r\n\nUK's ninety-nine year leasehold,  was formally agreed upon by\r\n\nthe UK and the PRC in 1984; the United States was not a party\r\n\nto this agreement.  See  Joint Declaration of the  Government\r                                   \r\n\nof the United Kingdom  of Great Britain and Northern  Ireland\r\n\nand the Government of  the People's Republic of China  on the\r\n\nQuestion  of Hong Kong,  Dec. 19, 1984,  ratified and entered\r\n\ninto  force  May 27,  1985, T.S.  No.  26 (1985)  (the \"Joint\r\n\nDeclaration\").  Under the terms of the Joint Declaration, the\r\n\nPRC  \"declares\" its  \"basic  policies\" with  respect to  Hong\r\n\nKong.   Id.   art.  3.   The PRC  states that  it intends  to\r                       \r\n\nestablish  a  \"Hong   Kong  Special  Administrative   Region\"\r\n\n(\"HKSAR\"),  id. art. 3(1), which will enjoy a \"high degree of\r                           \r\n\nautonomy except  in foreign and  defence affairs.\"   Id. art.\r                                                                    \r\n\n3(2).  In addition,  the PRC states that  the HKSAR \"will  be\r\n\nvested  with . . . independent judicial power, including that\r\n\nof final adjudication\" and that  the \"laws currently in force\r\n\nin Hong  Kong will  remain  basically unchanged.\"   Id.  art.\r                                                                   \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nof the Treaty as to any territory to which the Treaty was\r\nextended under article II(1)(a).

Clearly, the Senate was aware\r\n\nof the  planned reversion when it  approved the applicability\r\n\nto Hong Kong of the Supplementary Treaty.6  The Supplementary\r\n\nTreaty does not  contain an  exception for  relators who  can\r\n\nshow that their trial or punishment will occur after the date\r\n\nof reversion.   Indeed, the Supplementary  Treaty is entirely\r\n\nsilent on the question of reversion.\r\n\n          The  United States  does  not  have an  extradition\r\n\ntreaty  with the  PRC.   However, on  December 20,  1996, the\r\n\nUnited   States  signed  an   extradition  treaty   with  the\r\n\ngovernment  of   the  nascent  HKSAR,   which  provides   for\r\n\nreciprocal post-reversion extradition.  See Agreement Between\r                                                       \r\n\nthe  Government  of  the United  States  of  America and  the\r\n\nGovernment  of  Hong  Kong  for  the  Surrender  of  Fugitive\r\n\nOffenders,  Dec. 20, 1996 (the \"New Treaty\").

See 18 U.S.C. ch. 209.\r                                                      \r\n\nThe statute  establishes a  two-step procedure  which divides\r\n\nresponsibility  for extradition  between a  judicial officer7\r\n\nand  the Secretary of  State.  The  judicial officer's duties\r\n\nare set  out in  18 U.S.C.    3184.   In brief,  the judicial\r\n\nofficer,  upon complaint,  issues  an arrest  warrant for  an\r\n\nindividual sought for extradition,  provided that there is an\r\n\nextradition treaty between the United States and the relevant\r\n\nforeign government  and that the crime charged  is covered by\r\n\nthe  treaty.   See id.   If  a warrant  issues, the  judicial\r                                  \r\n\nofficer then conducts a hearing to determine if \"he deems the\r\n\nevidence   sufficient  to  sustain   the  charge   under  the\r\n\nprovisions  of  the proper  treaty.\"   Id.   If  the judicial\r                                                      \r\n\nofficer makes such a determination, he \"shall certify\" to the\r                                                         \r\n\nSecretary  of State that a  warrant for the  surrender of the\r\n\nrelator \"may  issue.\"   Id. (emphases added).   The  judicial\r                                       \r\n\nofficer is  also directed to  provide the Secretary  of State\r\n\nwith  a   copy  of  the  testimony  and   evidence  from  the\r\n\nextradition hearing.

The judicial officer may be any federal judge, any\r\nauthorized magistrate, or any state judge of a court of\r\ngeneral jurisdiction.

See 18 U.S.C.   3186 (\"The Secretary\r                                        \r\n\nof  State  may order  the  person  committed under  section[]\r                          \r\n\n3184 . . . of this  title to  be delivered to  any authorized\r\n\nagent of such  foreign government . . . .\") (emphasis added).\r\n\nThe  Secretary  has  the  authority to  review  the  judicial\r\n\nofficer's findings  of fact and conclusions  of law de novo,8\r                                                                       \r\n\nand  to  reverse  the  judicial  officer's  certification  of\r\n\nextraditability   if   she   believes   that   it   was  made\r\n\nerroneously.9 See 4  Abbell &amp; Ristau,  International Judicial\r                                                                         \r\n\nAssistance:  Criminal -  Extradition    13-3-8(2),  at 266-69\r                                                \r\n\n(1995); Note, Executive Discretion  in Extradition, 62 Colum.\r                                                              \r\n\nL.

Both institutional  competence rationales  and our\r\n\nconstitutional structure, which places primary responsibility\r\n\nfor  foreign  affairs in  the  executive  branch, see,  e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nUnited States  v.

For  example,  the\r\n\nexecutive branch's  construction of  a  treaty, although  not\r\n\nbinding upon the courts, is entitled to great weight.

For  that\r\n          reason, if  a treaty fairly admits of two\r\n          constructions, one restricting the rights\r\n          which may  be claimed  under it,  and the\r\n          other  enlarging  it,  the  more  liberal\r\n          construction is to be preferred.\"\r\n\nHoward, 996 F.2d at 1330-31 (quoting Factor, 290 U.S. at 293-\r                                                       \r\n\n94).\r\n\n          Another  principle that  guides  courts in  matters\r\n\nconcerning extradition is the rule of non-inquiry.  More than\r\n\njust a  principle of  treaty construction, the  rule of  non-\r\n\ninquiry  tightly limits  the  appropriate  scope of  judicial\r\n\nanalysis  in an  extradition proceeding.   Under the  rule of\r\n\nnon-inquiry, courts refrain from \"investigating  the fairness\r\n\nof a  requesting nation's justice  system,\" id. at  1329, and\r                                                           \r\n\nfrom inquiring \"into the  procedures or treatment which await\r\n\na   surrendered   fugitive   in   the   requesting  country.\"\r\n\nArnbjornsdottir-Mendler v. United States,  721 F.2d 679,  683\r                                                    \r\n\n(9th Cir. 1983).   The rule of non-inquiry,  like extradition\r\n\nprocedures   generally,   is   shaped   by   concerns   about\r\n\ninstitutional  competence  and by  notions  of  separation of\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\npowers.   See United States  v. Smyth, 61 F.3d  711, 714 (9th\r                                                 \r\n\nCir. 1995).11  It is not that questions about what awaits the\r\n\nrelator  in   the  requesting  country   are  irrelevant   to\r\n\nextradition;  it   is  that   there  is  another   branch  of\r\n\ngovernment, which  has both final say  and greater discretion\r\n\nin  these  proceedings,  to  whom these  questions  are  more\r\n\nproperly addressed.12\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n11.  One commentator has analogized the rule of non-inquiry\r\nto the \"act of state\" doctrine, which prohibits United States\r\ncourts from judging the governmental acts of a foreign\r\ncountry performed within its own territory.  See Semmelman,\r                                                            \r\nFederal Courts, The Constitution, and The Rule of Non-Inquiry\r                                                                         \r\nin International Extradition Proceedings, 76 Cornell L. Rev.\r                                                    \r\n1198 (1991).  The \"act of state\" doctrine, the Supreme Court\r\nhas said, \"arises out of the basic relationships between\r\nbranches of government in a system of separation of powers. \r\nIt concerns the competency of dissimilar institutions to make\r\nand implement particular kinds of decisions in the area of\r\ninternational relations.\"  Banco Nacional de Cuba v.\r                                                             \r\nSabbatino, 376 U.S. 398, 423 (1964).  This court has doubted,\r                     \r\nin dicta, that the rule of non-inquiry is constitutionally\r\nmandated.  Howard, 996 F.2d at 1330 n.6.  Whether the\r                             \r\ndoctrine is constitutionally mandated is immaterial here.\r\n\n12.  Nor is it true, as Lui suggests, that the rule of non-\r\ninquiry is only appropriate where the existence of a treaty\r\nreflects a substantive judgment about the fairness of another\r\nnation's procedures.  The United States has maintained, over\r\ntime, extradition treaties with some of the world's most\r\noppressive and arbitrary regimes.  See 18 U.S.C.   3181\r                                                  \r\n(listing treaties of extradition and dates entered into). \r\nThe rule of non-inquiry expresses no judgment about a foreign\r                                                \r\nnation's ability and willingness to provide justice; it\r\nsimply defers that assessment to the second part of every\r\nextradition proceeding -- review of extraditability and\r\ndetermination of the appropriateness of surrender by the\r\nSecretary of State.  Indeed, a leading commentator, in\r\ndiscussing the scope of the Secretary's discretion under 18\r\nU.S.C.   3186, has argued that it is precisely \"because of\r                                                                      \r\nthe rule of non-inquiry\" that it is appropriate for the\r\nSecretary to exercise discretion on humanitarian grounds.  II\r\nBassiouni, supra, at 602 (emphasis added).\r                            \r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\n          Lui contends  that, on July 1,  1997, the reversion\r\n\nof Hong Kong to the PRC will result in his being subjected to\r\n\ntrial and punishment by a regime with which the United States\r\n\nhas no extradition  treaty.  This  future event, Lui  argues,\r\n\noperates retroactively  to render his extradition illegal, as\r                                                                         \r\n\nof today,  because, he  says, extradition is  only legitimate\r                    \r\n\nwhere trial and punishment will be administered by the regime\r\n\nwith which the United States has a treaty.  \r\n\n          Although Lui  is  correct that  the government  has\r\n\nconceded  that he will not  be tried before  reversion, it is\r\n\nalso quite  possible that  the scenario he  depicts will  not\r\n\narise.   The  new extradition  treaty with  the HKSAR  may be\r\n\napproved  by   the  United  States  Senate,   establishing  a\r\n\ncontinuity  of treaties  through and  beyond July  1, 1997.13\r\n\nThe United States government may choose to extend the current\r\n\nTreaty by executive  agreement.14  To  the extent that  Lui's\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n13.  The government does not argue that, absent any other\r\naction and of their own accord, the Treaties would continue\r\nbeyond reversion to apply to Hong Kong.  Accordingly, on the\r\nfacts of this case, we find the discussion of the state\r\nsuccession doctrine in Terlinden v. Ames, 184 U.S. 270\r                                                    \r\n(1902), a case heavily relied upon by the district court, see\r                                                                         \r\nLui Habeas, --- F. Supp. at ---, 1997 WL 37477, at *4-*5, to\r                      \r\nbe of little assistance to Lui.  Of course, the discussion in\r\nTerlinden of the rule of non-inquiry is relevant, and\r                     \r\nsupports our analysis.\r\n\n14.  It may be argued that this alternative infringes upon\r\nthe Senate's prerogative, under the Treaty Clause, U.S.\r\nConst., art. II,   2, to give its advice and consent.  But it\r\nis hardly an appropriate judicial task to attempt to resolve\r\na hypothetical and not ripe dispute between the legislature\r\nand the executive.\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\nargument depends on the fairness of the procedures he will be\r\n\nsubjected to,  he asks this court to decide that the PRC will\r\n\nnot adhere to the Joint Declaration  with the UK, in which it\r\n\ndeclared its  intention to maintain Hong  Kong's legal system\r\n\nfor fifty years.\r\n\n          All  of these  questions involve  an evaluation  of\r\n\ncontingent political events.  The Supreme Court has said that\r\n\nthe indicia of a non-justiciable political question include: \r\n\n          a  textually demonstrable  constitutional\r\n          commitment  of the issue  to a coordinate\r\n          political  department;  or   a  lack   of\r\n          judicially  discoverable  and  manageable\r\n          standards  for  resolving   it;  or   the\r\n          impossibility  of   deciding  without  an\r\n          initial  policy  determination of  a kind\r\n          clearly  for  nonjudicial discretion;  or\r\n          the    impossibility    of   a    court's\r\n          undertaking     independent    resolution\r\n          without  expressing  lack of  respect due\r\n          coordinate branches of government;  or an\r\n          unusual need  for unquestioning adherence\r\n          to a political decision already  made; or\r\n          the  potentiality  of embarrassment  from\r\n          multifarious  pronouncements  by  various\r\n          departments on one question.\r\n\nBaker v.  Carr, 369 U.S. 186,  217 (1962).  While  not all of\r                          \r\n\nthese ingredients  are present here, several  are.  Moreover,\r\n\nunlike  many \"political questions,\"  whose resolution, absent\r\n\njudicial  determination,  must  await  the  vagaries  of  the\r\n\npolitical  process, here  there is  a statutory  scheme which\r\n\nprovides  for  the  resolution   of  these  questions  by  an\r\n\nidentified  member of  the  executive branch.   The  case for\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\njudicial  resolution  is  thus  weaker than  with  many  such\r\n\nquestions.\r\n\n          The   principles   of   reciprocity   and   liberal\r\n\nconstruction  also counsel against construing the Treaties so\r\n\nas to  prohibit Lui's  extradition.   Hong Kong,  through the\r\n\nUnited  Kingdom,  has  entered bilateral  treaties  with  the\r\n\nUnited  States.  The United  States has sought extradition of\r\n\ncriminals  from  Hong  Kong in  the  past,  and  may wish  to\r\n\ncontinue to  do so up until  July 1, 1997.   If the executive\r\n\nchooses  to modify or abrogate the terms of the Treaties that\r\n\nit negotiated, it has ample discretion to do so.  However, if\r\n\nthis court were to read a cut-off date vis-a-vis extraditions\r\n\nto  Hong Kong into the Treaties, it would risk depriving both\r\n\nparties of the benefit of their bargain.\r\n\n          None  of  these principles,  including non-inquiry,\r\n\nmay be regarded as an absolute.  We, like the Second Circuit,\r\n\n\"can imagine situations where the relator, upon  extradition,\r\n\nwould be subject to  procedures or punishment so antipathetic\r\n\nto  a  federal  court's  sense  of   decency  as  to  require\r\n\nreexamination of the principle[s]\"  discussed above.  Gallina\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Fraser,  278 F.2d 77, 79 (2d Cir. 1960).  This is not such\r                     \r\n\na  case.    Lui  is  wanted  for  economic,  not   political,\r\n\nactivities  whose  criminality  is  fully  recognized in  the\r\n\nUnited States.  His extradition is sought by the current Hong\r                                                                    \r\n\nKong regime, a colony of Great Britain, which, as Lui himself\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\npoints  out,  is one  of this  country's most  trusted treaty\r\n\npartners.  Moreover, Lui  has been a fugitive from  Hong Kong\r\n\nsince  1994.    He  has been  subject  to  extradition  since\r\n\nentering the United States in December 1995.  That now only a\r\n\nfew months remain before the reversion of Hong Kong is partly\r\n\nattributable to strategic choices made by Lui himself.  There\r\n\nis nothing here which shocks the conscience of this court.\r\n\nB.  The Treaties\r                            \r\n\n          There  is   no   dispute  that   the   Treaty,   as\r\n\nsupplemented  by the  Supplementary  Treaty, is  currently in\r\n\neffect and is applicable  to Hong Kong.  The  district court,\r\n\nin granting Lui's habeas petition, reasoned that \"the Treaty,\r\n\nby its  own terms, does not allow the extradition of a person\r\n\nto Hong  Kong if the Crown  Colony of Hong Kong  is unable to\r\n\ntry and to punish that person.\"   Lui Habeas, --- F. Supp. at\r                                                        \r\n\n---, 1997 WL  37477, at *5.  The government counters that the\r\n\nterms of the Treaty clearly  allow Lui's extradition.   There\r\n\nis nothing in the  plain language of the Treaties  that would\r\n\npermit  the  construction made  by the  district court.   The\r\n\nprinciples discussed above argue persuasively against reading\r\n\njudicially created limitations into the Treaties' unambiguous\r\n\ntext. \r\n\n1.  Overview\r                        \r\n\n          We begin our analysis of the Treaties with  a brief\r\n\noverview of the Treaties' operative provisions.  Article I of\r\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\nthe  Treaty  states the  basic reciprocal  compact, providing\r\n\nthat:\r\n\n               Each Contracting Party undertakes to\r\n          extradite   to   the   other,    in   the\r\n          circumstances   and    subject   to   the\r\n          conditions specified in this  Treaty, any\r\n          person found  in  its territory  who  has\r\n          been  accused or convicted of any offense\r\n          within Article III, committed  within the\r\n          jurisdiction of the other Party.\r\n\nTreaty, art. I.\r\n\n          Article   III   contains  the   \"dual  criminality\"\r\n\nrequirement, a  requirement that is \"central   to extradition\r\n\nlaw and  [one that] has  been embodied  either explicitly  or\r\n\nimplicitly  in  all prior  extradition  treaties  between the\r\n\nUnited States and Great Britain.\"  Brauch v. Raiche, 618 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n843, 847 (1st  Cir. 1980).   Article III,  in relevant  part,\r\n\nprovides that:\r\n\n               Extradition shall be granted  for an\r\n          act   or  omission  the  facts  of  which\r\n          disclose  an offense  within  any of  the\r\n          descriptions   listed  in   the  Schedule\r\n          annexed to this Treaty . . . or any other\r\n          offense,   if:   (a)   the   offense   is\r\n          punishable under the laws of both Parties\r\n          by   imprisonment   or   other  form   of\r\n          detention  for more than  one year  or by\r\n          the death penalty . . . .\r\n\nTreaty, art. III(1).   The annexed Schedule lists twenty-nine\r\n\ngeneral crimes, including bribery, the crime of which Lui  is\r\n\naccused.  See Treaty, Schedule, No. 23.  \r                         \r\n\n          Article  V  contains various  affirmative defenses,\r\n\nincluding the  \"political offense\"  exception.  As  a general\r\n\n                             -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n\nmatter, the  political offense  exception \"is now  a standard\r\n\nclause in almost all  extradition treaties of the world.\"   I\r\n\nBassiouni, supra, at 384.  The political offense exception in\r                            \r\n\nthe Treaty  prohibits extradition where \"(i)  the offense for\r\n\nwhich extradition  is requested is regarded  by the requested\r\n\nParty as one  of a  political character; or  (ii) the  person\r\n\nsought proves  that the  request for  his extradition has  in\r\n\nfact  been  made with  a view  to try  or  punish him  for an\r\n\noffense of a political character.\"  Treaty, art. V(1)(c).\r\n\n          The Supplementary Treaty  narrows the  availability\r\n\nof this political  offense exception.   It lists  a range  of\r\n\ncrimes -- all crimes  of violence -- that may not be regarded\r\n\nas  political  offenses  for   the  purpose  of  raising  the\r\n\npolitical offense exception.   See Supplementary Treaty, art.\r                                              \r\n\n1.    The Supplementary  Treaty  also  offers an  affirmative\r\n\ndefense to fugitives  sought for crimes  of violence who,  by\r\n\nvirtue  of its article 1,  are unable to  raise the political\r\n\noffense exception.  See Supplementary Treaty, art. 3(a), (b).\r                                   \r\n\nSuch a fugitive may block extradition by establishing:\r\n\n          by  a preponderance of  the evidence that\r\n          the request for  extradition has in  fact\r\n          been made  with a  view to try  or punish\r\n          him on  account  of his  race,  religion,\r\n          nationality,  or  political opinions,  or\r\n          that   he   would,  if   surrendered,  be\r\n          prejudiced  at  his  trial  or  punished,\r\n          detained  or  restricted in  his personal\r\n          liberty by reason  of his race, religion,\r\n          nationality or political opinions.\r\n\nId. art. 3(a).\r               \r\n\n                             -24-\r                                          24\r\r\n\n          The procedural requisites of an extradition request\r\n\nare specified in article VII of the Treaty.

Specialty  has two\r\n\nbasic components.   First, the  requesting state may  not try\r\n\nthe fugitive for any crimes other than the specific crime for\r\n\nwhich  extradition  was  sought  and granted.    Second,  the\r\n\nrequesting state may not re-extradite the fugitive to a third\r\n\nstate.  See Treaty, art. XII. \r                       \r\n\n2.  Analysis\r                        \r\n\n          Both  the  district court  and  Lui  focus on  four\r\n\nTreaty   provisions   in  concluding   that  the   Treaty  is\r\n\ninapplicable to  Lui.  See  Lui Habeas, --- F.  Supp. at ---,\r                                                  \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n15.  Article IX(1), in turn, states that extradition shall\r\nnot be granted if the evidentiary showing required by article\r\nVII(3) is not made by the requesting party.\r\n\n                             -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n\n1997  WL 37477,  at *5-*7.   We  address these  provisions in\r\n\nturn,  concluding that the obligation of the United States to\r\n\nextradite Lui, specified in  article I of the Treaty,  is not\r\n\nundermined  by any of these provisions.  We base our analysis\r\n\non  the plain  language  of the  Treaty.   United  States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nAlvarez-Machain, 504 U.S 655, 663 (1992); Sumitomo Shoji Am.,\r                                                                         \r\n\nInc. v. Avagliano, 457 U.S. 176, 180 (1982).  Underlying this\r                             \r\n\nanalysis  is the court's awareness of the limited role of the\r\n\njudiciary in extradition proceedings. \r\n\nThe Warrant Requirement \r                                   \r\n\n          The   district   court   understood   the   warrant\r\n\nrequirement  of  article  VII(3)  to  serve  the  purpose  of\r\n\npermitting \"the requested sovereign  to know that the relator\r\n\nhas been accused . . . pursuant to the laws of the requesting\r\n\nsovereign,  and  that  he  will  be  tried  and  punished  in\r\n\naccordance  with that sovereign's laws.\"   Lui Habeas, --- F.\r                                                                 \r\n\nSupp.  at  ---, 1997  WL 37477,  at *6.    In this  case, the\r\n\ndistrict court  reasoned, since  Lui would  not  be tried  in\r\n\naccordance  with the  present  Hong Kong  regime's laws,  the\r\n\nwarrant requirement was not met.  Id. \r                                                 \r\n\n          There is nothing in the language of article VII(3),\r\n\nor  the rest of article VII, which indicates that the warrant\r\n\nrequirement serves  the greater function attributed  to it by\r\n\nthe district court.   Indeed, the warrant requirement appears\r\n\nto do nothing  more than to help the judicial  officer in the\r\n\n                             -26-\r                                          26\r\r\n\nrequested country to confirm  that there are in  fact charges\r\n\nproperly  pending  against  the  relator  in   the  requested\r\n\ncountry, and that the relator  is actually the person sought.\r\n\nIt does  not authorize  the investigation which  the district\r\n\ncourt  envisioned,   and  indeed  such  an  investigation  is\r\n\nforeclosed  by  the  rule  of  non-inquiry.    A warrant  was\r\n\nprovided  by the Hong Kong authorities here, and Lui does not\r\n\nattack its validity or authenticity.  The warrant requirement\r\n\nwas plainly satisfied.\r\n\nThe Dual Criminality Requirement \r                                            \r\n\n          The  district court  understood the purpose  of the\r\n\ndual criminality requirement, as stated in article III of the\r\n\nTreaty, to be  \"to provide the  requested sovereign with  the\r\n\nopportunity to examine the  substantive law of the requesting\r\n\nsovereign in the context of the Treaty.\"  Lui Habeas,  --- F.\r                                                                \r\n\nSupp. at  ---, 1997 WL 37477,  at *6.  The  court stated that\r\n\nthe  requirement  serves  to  \"underscore[]  the  expectation\r\n\nrunning through the Treaty that [Lui] is to be tried, judged,\r\n\nand punished in  accordance with the  laws of the  requesting\r\n\nsovereign.\"  Id.\r                            \r\n\n          There  is nothing in the text of article III of the\r\n\nTreaty  that supports  this  sweeping conclusion.   The  dual\r\n\ncriminality requirement, by its  plain terms, is satisfied if\r\n\nthe  crime of  which the  relator is  accused appears  on the\r\n\nannexed Schedule  or is  punishable in  both countries by  at\r\n\n                             -27-\r                                          27\r\r\n\nleast  one year's  imprisonment.   Bribery,  as noted  above,\r\n\nappears on the annexed Schedule.  \r\n\n          The purpose of the dual criminality requirement  is\r\n\nsimply to ensure that extradition is granted only for  crimes\r\n\nthat are regarded as  serious in both countries.   See United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.

Supp. at  ---, 1997 WL 37477, at *6.   In this\r                  \r\n\ncase, stated  the district  court, article  3(a) \"underscores\r\n\nagain   the  Treaty's   requirement   and  expectation   that\r\n\nextradition  . .  .  may not  take  place if  the  requesting\r\n\nsovereign  .  . .  is unable  to try  and  punish Lui  in the\r\n\nrelatively few days left before its reversion to China.\"  Id.\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -28-\r                                          28\r\r\n\n          The  Supplementary Treaty  article 3(a)  defense is\r\n\nsimply inapplicable here.  Supplementary Treaty  article 3(a)\r\n\ndescribes  a defense  which  is available  only to  fugitives\r\n\ncharged with one of the crimes specified in article 1  of the\r\n\nSupplementary Treaty,  all of  which are crimes  of violence.\r\n\nLui's  alleged crime -- bribery -- is  not  among the  crimes\r\n\nenumerated in the Supplementary Treaty's article 1.\r\n\n          Indeed,  the  very  purpose  of  the  Supplementary\r\n\nTreaty was to cabin  the political offense exception so  that\r\n\nperpetrators of  certain violent offenses  would be precluded\r\n\nfrom  avoiding  extradition  simply  because  their  criminal\r\n\nactivity was  inspired by political motivation.   See Howard,\r                                                                        \r\n\n996 F.2d at 1324-25.   Because this contraction of  the time-\r\n\nhonored political  offense exception stirred up  a great deal\r\n\nof controversy during negotiations, a compromise position was\r\n\nultimately  agreed  upon,  so  that  fugitives   barred  from\r\n\ninvoking the political offense  defense might still claim the\r\n\nprotection  of the more limited defense of article 3(a).  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nid. at 1324 (discussing  negotiating history and  legislative\r               \r\n\nhistory).  \r\n\n          Lui properly does not claim  that he is entitled to\r\n\nthe   article  V(1)(c)  political  offense  exception.16  The\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n16.

Lui made no  such showing of  discrimination, and the\r\n\ndistrict court, in making its own predictions about the post-\r\n\nreversion justice  system in  Hong Kong, exceeded  the narrow\r\n\ninquiry permitted by article 3(a). \r\n\nThe Rule of Specialty\r                                 \r\n\n          The   district   court   understood  the   Treaty's\r\n\nspecialty provision  to signify that \"the  Treaty allows only\r\n\nfor extradition for  offenses that can be  tried and punished\r\n\nby the requesting sovereign.\"  Lui Habeas, --- F.

Because the specialty obligation\r\n\ncannot  be enforced  by  the United  States after  reversion,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n169, 172 (1st Cir. 1991) (citing cases).\r\n\n                             -30-\r                                          30\r\r\n\nreasoned  the  district court,  article  XII  is violated  ab\r                                                                         \r\n\ninitio, and Lui cannot be extradited.

The rule has two basic requirements: that the relator\r\n\nbe tried  for the crimes  charged in the  extradition warrant\r\n\nand that the relator not be re-extradited to another country.\r\n\nThere is no claim that either of these is violated.   Indeed,\r\n\nas the district court properly recognized, Lui is not arguing\r\n\nthat  the reversion  itself would  constitute a de  facto re-\r\n\nextradition  from  Hong Kong  to  China in  violation  of the\r\n\nspecialty provision.  Lui  Habeas, --- F. Supp. at  ---, 1997\r                                             \r\n\nWL 37477, at *12 n.15; see also Oen Yin-Choy v.

The  responses to  that\r\n\nargument  are largely those outlined at the beginning of this\r\n\nopinion.   We add only our thoughts directed to the specialty\r\n\nclause itself.\r\n\n          If Lui's position were correct,  the enforceability\r\n\nof  many extradition treaties to which the United States is a\r\n\nparty would be thrown into grave doubt.  Regimes come and go,\r\n\n                             -31-\r                                          31\r\r\n\nas, indeed, do  states.   Moreover, 18 U.S.C.    3184,  which\r\n\ndefines  the role of  the courts in  the extradition process,\r\n\ngives  no discretion  to the  judicial officer  to refuse  to\r\n\ncertify extraditability  on the ground that  a treaty partner\r\n\ncannot  assure  the requested  country  that  rights under  a\r\n\ntreaty  will be enforced or protected.  See Saccocia, 58 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\nat 766-67.\r\n\n          The Ninth Circuit, writing in 1988, also rejected a\r\n\nsimilar argument made by a fugitive who fought extradition by\r\n\narguing that the United States would be unable to compel Hong\r\n\nKong's  compliance  with  the  specialty  obligation because,\r\n\nalthough  he  would  face  trial in  the  Crown  Colony,  his\r\n\nimprisonment might extend past the reversion date.  \"Were the\r\n\nTreaty to be interpreted  as [the fugitive] asks, extradition\r\n\nto  Hong Kong  would be  the exception  rather than  the rule\r\n\nbecause it would  be limited in practice only to extraditions\r\n\nfor crimes which could be punished for a term expiring before\r\n\nthe  reversion date.\"    Oen  Yin-Choy,  858  F.2d  at  1404.\r                                                  \r\n\nIndeed,  if we  interpreted the  specialty provision  in this\r\n\nway,  we  would  be  forced  to  conclude  that  any  relator\r\n\nextradited from the United  States to Hong Kong at  any point\r\n\nsince  the signing of the Joint Declaration, was, if he faced\r\n\na term of imprisonment upon conviction that could conceivably\r\n\nextend  past  the date  of reversion,  sent  to Hong  Kong in\r\n\nviolation of the Treaty.\r\n\n                             -32-\r                                          32\r\r\n\n          Of course,  Lui may express his  concerns about the\r\n\npost-reversion  enforceability of specialty  to the Secretary\r\n\nof State, who, in her discretion, may choose not to surrender\r\n\nhim.    We note  that the  newly  signed, as  yet unratified,\r\n\nextradition treaty  between the  United States and  the HKSAR\r\n\nprovides that  specialty protection \"shall apply  to fugitive\r\n\noffenders who have been surrendered between the parties prior\r\n\nto the  entry into  force\" of  the new  treaty.

It is  not  the role  of  the judiciary  to\r\n\nspeculate about the  future ability of  the United States  to\r\n\nenforce treaty obligations.\r\n\n                             III.\r\n\n          Lui   also  challenges  the  determination  of  the\r\n\nmagistrate  judge that  there was  probable cause  to believe\r\n\nthat  Lui had  violated Hong Kong  law on  eight of  the nine\r\n\ncharges in the warrant.  Although the district court declined\r\n\nto review this issue, we do reach it.\r\n\n          Lui  protests  that we  lack  power  to reach  this\r\n\nissue,  and that  we must  remand to  the district  court for\r\n\nfurther findings.   However, the issue was fully  briefed and\r\n\nargued  to the district court.  The record is complete.  This\r\n\nis  a habeas corpus appeal,  in which the  district court was\r\n\nnot  the fact finder but had  only a review function over the\r\n\nfindings  made by the magistrate  judge.  The  function to be\r\n\nexercised by  the district  court is  more akin to  appellate\r\n\n                             -33-\r                                          33\r\r\n\nreview,  and is  done  on the  same record  as is  before us.\r\n\nUnder these circumstances, the  district court had no greater\r\n\ninstitutional competence to perform  this review task than do\r\n\nwe.

There is no unfairness to Lui.  He has had full\r\nopportunity to address the issue of whether there is probable\r\ncause for extradition before the magistrate judge and full\r\nopportunity to address the magistrate judge's determination\r\nbefore the district court.  In the extradition proceedings\r\nbefore the magistrate judge, Lui filed a 45 page memorandum\r\non the probable cause issue accompanied by a copious\r\nappendix.  He also filed motions to exclude certain of the\r\ngovernment's evidence, called witnesses, and presented both\r\nlive testimony and testimony by affidavit.\r\n\n                             -35-\r                                          35\r\r\n\nengaged in a more  rigorous review of the  evidence presented\r\n\nbefore the judicial officer, thus raising questions about the\r\n\nactual content  of the \"any  evidence\" standard.

The Supreme\r                 \r\n\nCourt  last addressed  the scope  of a  court's  authority on\r\n\nhabeas corpus review of a finding of extraditability in 1925,\r\n\nwhen  it said that \"the alleged fugitive from justice has had\r\n\nhis hearing\" and  that \"habeas  corpus is  available only  to\r\n\ninquire\"  into a very limited list of issues.

The existence of \"any  evidence warranting\r\n\nthe finding  that there was reasonable ground  to believe the\r\n\naccused  guilty\"  was  one  of only  three  issues  that  the\r\n\nFernandez court said might  permissibly be reached on habeas.\r                     \r\n\nId.   At  that time, the scope of habeas corpus review of all\r                                                                         \r\n\nproceedings was  very limited, and  Fernandez's strictures on\r                                                         \r\n\nreview in extradition  proceedings, including the deferential\r\n\n\"any evidence\"  standard, may  simply reflect that  generally\r\n\nnarrower  view of the  writ.

Thus,  it is  arguable\r                          \r\n\nthat the \"any evidence\" standard is  an anachronism, and that\r\n\nthis  court should engage in  a more searching  review of the\r\n\nmagistrate's probable cause findings.\r\n\n          There is no reason to predict a resolution of  this\r\n\nissue  here.  Whatever the prism through which this record is\r\n\nreviewed, ranging from  a strictly  construed \"any  evidence\"\r\n\nstandard to  de  novo  review, our  conclusion  is  that  the\r                                 \r\n\ngovernment has met its burden.\r\n\n          The purpose  of  the  evidentiary  portion  of  the\r\n\nextradition  hearing  is  to  determine  whether  the  United\r\n\nStates, on behalf of  the requesting government, has produced\r\n\nsufficient  evidence  to hold  the  person  for trial.    The\r\n\nstandard of  sufficiency is  derived from United  States law,\r\n\nincluding the  Treaty between the  United States and  the UK.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n18.

(citing\r\n\ncases).  The Supplementary Treaty defines probable cause:\r\n\n               Probable  cause means  whether there\r\n          is sufficient evidence  to warrant a  man\r\n          of  reasonable  caution  in   the  belief\r\n          that . . . an offense  has been committed\r\n          by the accused.\r\n\nSupplementary Treaty, art. 2.   The actual trial, if  any, is\r\n\nin  the foreign  court,  and it  is not  the  purpose of  the\r\n\nextradition  hearing to  determine  whether the  evidence  is\r\n\nsufficient  to justify conviction.   Thus it  is the probable\r\n\ncause determination which is subject to our review.\r\n\n          There is no  dispute that payments  of over HK  $21\r\n\nmillion (approximately US $3  million) and unsecured loans of\r\n\nHK $10 million  (approximately US $1.4 million)  were made to\r\n\n                             -38-\r                                          38\r\r\n\nLui, that the payments  were made into foreign  bank accounts\r\n\nin Lui's name, and  that the payments were not  made directly\r\n\nby check but  through a series of steps which  made them more\r\n\ndifficult  to trace.    There is  also  no dispute  that  the\r\n\npayments  were  made on  the dates  charged.   The  timing is\r\n\nsignificant.  The payments  coincided with the knowledge that\r\n\nLui was being  considered as Director  of Exports for  BAT-HK\r\n\nand with his  appointment to  that position in  1992.19   The\r\n\nloans  were  made  within three  days  of  Lui's  leaving his\r\n\nemployment  at  Brown &amp;  Williamson and  BAT-HK.   It  is not\r\n\ncontested that BAT-HK was the major supplier of cigarettes to\r\n\nGIL and WWC, that Brown  &amp; Williamson prohibits its employees\r\n\nfrom  accepting \"inducements\"  from those  with whom  it does\r\n\nbusiness and requires disclosure  statements to be completed,\r\n\nand that Lui failed to disclose any of these payments  on his\r\n\ndisclosure form.   The dispute between the government and Lui\r\n\nis basically over the purpose of these payments.\r\n\n          Two  competing theories  explaining the  purpose of\r\n\nthe payments were  presented to  the magistrate  judge.   The\r\n\ngovernment argued  that the  payments were bribes.   Although\r\n\nLui  had no  burden to  produce any evidence  at all  and the\r\n\nburden  of  showing probable  cause  rested  entirely on  the\r\n\ngovernment, Lui did present an  explanation for the loans and\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n19.  The one exception to this was the October 1988 payment\r\nalleged in Count II, as to which the magistrate judge found a\r\nlack of probable cause.\r\n\n                             -39-\r                                          39\r\r\n\npayments,  primarily  in  the  affidavit  of  Hung  Wing  Wah\r\n\n(\"Hung\"),  a former GIL director and sole proprietor of GIL's\r\n\nsubsidiary,  WWC.20  In essence, Hung said that, in or around\r\n\n1987, prior  to Lui's employment with Brown  &amp; Williamson, he\r\n\nand Lui  first began discussing \"cigarette business matters.\"\r\n\nHung  stated that  these  discussions eventually  led to  the\r\n\nestablishment of a profitable  business relationship in which\r\n\nHung  purchased  Japanese cigarettes  and  resold  them at  a\r\n\nprofit for  the account of  Chen Ying-Jen (\"Chen\"),  a former\r\n\nGIL principal.  The  payments to Lui's foreign  bank accounts\r\n\nwere filtered through Chen's account.\r\n\n          Hung stated  he was told  by Chen that,  because of\r\n\nthe   substantial   profits   generated   by   the   business\r\n\nrelationship Lui had been  instrumental in establishing, Chen\r\n\nhad agreed to pay  Lui for his assistance and  would continue\r\n\npaying Lui as  long as the relationship continued to generate\r\n\nsuch substantial profits.  Hung indicated that  the sums paid\r\n\nto  Lui bore  a reasonable  relationship to the  magnitude of\r\n\nChen's profits.  And finally, Hung  stated that the unsecured\r\n\nshort term  loans  had been  made to  Lui so  that Lui  could\r\n\ninvest  in the  then-booming Hong  Kong stock  market.   Hung\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n20.  Lui chose not to testify on his own behalf, as was his\r\nprerogative.  The magistrate judge properly excluded the\r\npolygraph evidence offered by Lui to corroborate his\r\ntestimony.  The polygraph evidence was not relevant, there\r\nbeing no such testimony in evidence to corroborate.  Whether\r\nit would be admissible if he did testify, we do not address.\r\n\n                             -40-\r                                          40\r\r\n\nstated  that  both the  principal  and  interest were  repaid\r\n\nshortly after the loans were made.  During the hearing before\r\n\nthe magistrate judge, Lui's  counsel indicated that Lui would\r\n\ntestify, and described  what that testimony  would be.   This\r\n\ndescription  matched  the  testimony  given  by  Hung.    Lui\r\n\nultimately declined to testify.\r\n\n          Lui  argued  that  the  government's  evidence  was\r\n\ninsufficient  to support  an  inference of  bribery and  that\r\n\nthere  was,  in  any event,  an  innocent  explanation.   The\r\n\ngovernment argued  that the undisputed  facts were sufficient\r\n\nto  establish probable  cause, and  that the  explanation was\r\n\ninherently implausible.   In addition, the government argued,\r\n\nit  had  two \"smoking  gun\"  statements  directly saying  the\r\n\npayments  were bribes.  We return to these two statements and\r\n\nLui's attack on them later.\r\n\n          The magistrate judge concluded that the explanation\r\n\nproffered  by  Lui's  counsel  --  \"to  the effect  that  the\r\n\npayments represented a gratuitous gesture of gratitude by one\r\n\nof   GIL's  former   principals  for   Lui's   assistance  in\r\n\nintroducing him to a supplier of Japanese cigarettes in 1987,\r\n\nsome six years  before the  last payments were  made\" --  was\r\n\ninherently implausible.

Without consideration of\r\n\nthe two  \"smoking gun\"  statements, the magistrate  judge was\r\n\nfully warranted in finding probable cause.\r\n\n          In addition,  the two statements, which  Lui argues\r\n\nwere  inadmissible,  were properly  admitted at  the probable\r\n\ncause stage  of the extradition hearing and further support a\r\n\nfinding of probable cause.\r\n\n          The  first  statement   was  given  to   Hong  Kong\r\n\ninvestigators  in July 1994 by Chui, one of Lui's alleged co-\r\n\nconspirators.   Chui was one  of the principals  of GIL until\r\n\nApril 1993.   In his  statement, Chui implicated  himself and\r\n\nother principals  of GIL in a scheme  to bribe Lui and others\r\n\nto  secure favorable allocations  of cigarettes  from BAT-HK.\r\n\nAccording to Chui, GIL  began paying bribes to Lui  when they\r\n\nfirst   anticipated  that  Lui  might  eventually  become  an\r\n\nimportant  BAT-HK   decisionmaker.

One of  Haddon-Cave's responsibilities was  to foster\r\n\nrelationships between  GIL and  major suppliers  like BAT-HK.\r\n\nHaddon-Cave testified  that Chui  told him in  Lui's presence\r\n\nthat Lui  was \"our man\" and an important link with GIL.  Lui,\r\n\nthen  BAT-HK's Director of Exports, did not deny it.  Haddon-\r\n\nCave further testified that later, outside of Lui's presence,\r\n\nChui  told him  that Lui  was \"on  the take\"  and had  become\r\n\nwealthy as a result of the payments that distributors made to\r\n\nhim to secure favorable allocations of cigarettes.  \r\n\n          The  framework  for  determining  admissibility  of\r\n\nevidence  here is  determined  by the  Treaty  itself and  by\r\n\nUnited   States  legal   rules  governing   admissibility  in\r\n\nextradition proceedings.      Pursuant  to  federal  statute,\r\n\ndocuments offered as evidence in an extradition hearing:\r\n\n          shall   be   received  and   admitted  as\r\n          evidence  . . . for  all the  purposes of\r\n          such  hearing if  they shall  be properly\r\n          and  legally  authenticated   so  as   to\r\n          entitle them  to be received  for similar\r\n          purposes by the tribunals of  the foreign\r\n          country  from  which  the  accused  party\r\n          shall have escaped . . . .\r\n\n                             -43-\r                                          43\r\r\n\n18  U.S.C.    3190.22   Proof of  such authentication  is the\r\n\ncertificate  of the principal  diplomatic or consular officer\r\n\nof the United States  resident in such foreign country.   Id.\r                                                                         \r\n\nAdditionally, article VII(5) of  the Treaty provides that any\r\n\nevidence given upon oath or affirmation \"shall be received in\r\n\nevidence in  any proceedings for  extradition\" if it  is duly\r\n\nauthenticated.   Treaty, art.  VII(5).  Both  the Haddon-Cave\r\n\ntestimony  and  the  Chui  statement meet  this  authenticity\r\n\nrequirement  and  were  thus  admissible  at the  extradition\r\n\nhearing by the terms of the relevant statute and treaties.\r\n\n          Lui argues nonetheless that the two statements were\r\n\nimproperly  admitted because  they would  be  inadmissible at\r\n\ntrial under  Hong Kong law.  Lui argues that it is inherently\r\n\nunfair to certify  that he  is extraditable on  the basis  of\r\n\nevidence that  would be inadmissible  in the  court where  he\r\n\nwould  face trial.  He  also argues that  failure to consider\r\n\nthe  Hong  Kong  High  Court's  declaratory  judgment  (later\r\n\nreversed) that the Chui statement would be inadmissible would\r\n\nevince great disrespect for the judicial system of Hong Kong.\r\n\nBoth of these arguments are misplaced.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n22.  Lui does not rely on the language of 18 U.S.C.   3190. \r\nMost courts reviewing the language have concluded that   3190\r\nrequires only that the evidence meet any authentication\r\nrequirement imposed by a foreign tribunal, not that it be\r\nadmissible, much less that it be admissible at trial.  See\r                                                                      \r\nOen Yin-Choy, 858 F.2d at 1406; Lui Extradition, 939 F.

Indeed, at a preliminary hearing in federal court\r\n\na \"finding of  probable cause  may be based  upon hearsay  in\r\n\nwhole or in part.\"  Fed. R. Crim. P. 5.1(a).  This is because\r\n\na \"preliminary hearing  is not  a minitrial of  the issue  of\r\n\nguilt,\" Coleman v.  Burnett, 477 F.2d  1187, 1201 (D.C.  Cir.\r                                       \r\n\n1973); rather,  \"its  function is  the  more limited  one  of\r\n\ndetermining whether probable cause exists to hold the accused\r\n\nfor trial.\"   Barber v. Page,  390 U.S. 719, 725  (1968).  An\r                                        \r\n\nextradition   hearing   similarly   involves  a   preliminary\r\n\nexamination of the evidence and is not a trial.   Charlton v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nKelly,  229 U.S. 447, 461  (1913); Romeo v.

An extradition  hearing does not\r\n\nrequire  a higher standard of evidence  than a probable cause\r\n\nhearing.    The special  and  limited  nature of  extradition\r\n\nhearings  is  manifested  in  a  more  lenient  standard  for\r\n\nadmissibility  of evidence.    Neither the  Federal Rules  of\r\n\nCriminal Procedure, see  Fed. R. Crim.  P. 54(b)(5), nor  the\r                                   \r\n\nFederal  Rules of  Evidence,  see Fed.  R. Evid.  1101(d)(3),\r                                             \r\n\napply to extradition hearings.   The evidence may coU.S. 309,\r\n\n317 (1922).    So  American domestic law has already resolved\r\n\nagainst  Lui  any   claim  that  there  is   a  violation  of\r\n\nConstitutional rights from the admission of hearsay  evidence\r\n\n                             -45-\r                                          45\r\r\n\nat  a probable cause hearing  which would not  be admitted at\r\n\ntrial.\r\n\n          Under Hong Kong law, the Haddon-Cave statement  and\r\n\nthe Chui statement present separate and distinct issues.  The\r\n\nHaddon-Cave statement was ruled inadmissible at the Hong Kong\r\n\ntrial of Chong Tsoi-Jun (\"Chong\"), an alleged co-conspirator,\r\n\non an objection that  it was not  made in furtherance of  the\r\n\nconspiracy.\r\n\n          As to  the Chui statement,  a Hong Kong  High Court\r\n\njudge   issued  a   declaration   that  the   statement   was\r\n\ninadmissible  hearsay.   On appeal,  the  Hong Kong  Court of\r\n\nAppeal vacated this ruling, finding  that Lui's request for a\r\n\ndeclaratory  judgment was  not justiciable  in the  Hong Kong\r\n\ncourts, but  that even if it  were, the judge's grant  of the\r\n\ndeclaration  would be an abuse  of discretion.   The Court of\r\n\nAppeal reasoned that  the issue of  the admissibility of  the\r\n\nChui statement in the extradition proceeding was a matter for\r\n\nthe United States court to decide.  The court noted, however,\r\n\nthat the  parties agreed that the  statement was inadmissible\r\n\nhearsay under  Hong  Kong law.   In  light of  the Hong  Kong\r\n\ncourt's  statement   that  the  admissibility  of   the  Chui\r\n\nstatement in  the extradition  hearing  is a  matter for  the\r\n\nUnited  States court  to decide,  admission of  the statement\r\n\ninto evidence  cannot be viewed as a sign of disrespect for a\r\n\nsister court.\r\n\n                             -46-\r                                          46\r\r\n\n          The focus on admissibility is, we think, misplaced,\r\n\nboth  based  on  these  facts and  on  larger,  institutional\r\n\nconcerns about the operation  of habeas corpus in extradition\r\n\ncertifications.   While in Manzi we  \"recognized that serious\r                                            \r\n\ndue process concerns may merit review beyond the narrow scope\r\n\nof inquiry  in extradition proceedings,\" there  is no serious\r\n\ndue process issue here.  See Manzi, 888 F.2d at 206; see also\r                                                                         \r\n\nKoskotas,  931 F.2d  at  174; cf.  Burt,  737 F.2d  at  1481;\r                                                   \r\n\nGallina,  278 F.2d  at  78.    Lui's  liberty  interests  are\r                   \r\n\nprotected  by  the very  existence  of  \"an unbiased  hearing\r\n\nbefore an independent judiciary.\"   In re Kaine, 55  U.S. (14\r                                                           \r\n\nHow.) 103 (1852).  \r\n\n          Inherent  in the  probable  cause  standard is  the\r\n\nnecessity  of  a  determination  that the  evidence  is  both\r\n\nsufficiently reliable and of sufficient weight to warrant the\r\n\nconclusion.    The  probable  cause standard  does  not  even\r\n\nrequire   that  the   government  make   its  showing   by  a\r\n\npreponderance of  the evidence.  But neither is it toothless.\r\n\nAll evidence does not  have the same importance even if it is\r\n\nauthentic and admissible.  For example, a confession obtained\r\n\nby duress is inherently unreliable  and would be given little\r\n\nweight even  if the confession were authenticated.   See Gill\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Imundi, 747 F.  Supp. 1028, 1042-47 (S.D.N.Y. 1990).   The\r                     \r\n\nreliability of  the evidence is  a factor  for the  reviewing\r\n\ncourt   to  consider  as  well,  and  potentially  unreliable\r\n\n                             -47-\r                                          47\r\r\n\nevidence  may  be  accorded  reduced  weight  by  the  court.\r\n\nRestatement, supra,   478.\r                              \r\n\n          No such  concerns about reliability  are implicated\r\n\nhere.    First,   the  statements  themselves   were  neither\r\n\ninvoluntary  nor  obtained under  questionable circumstances.\r\n\nFurther, the  Hong  Kong  courts  did not  rule  that  either\r\n\nstatement  was   untrue  or  otherwise  cast   doubt  on  the\r\n\nstatements'   credibility.     Each  statement   was  thought\r\n\ninadmissible in  Hong Kong on grounds  pertaining to hearsay.\r\n\nThe Haddon-Cave statement was deemed inadmissible because  it\r\n\ndid not meet one  of the requirements for admissibility  of a\r\n\nco-conspirator's statement.  The  Chui statement was  thought\r\n\ninadmissible because  the declarant was dead.   The Hong Kong\r\n\ngovernment alleges  that Chui was involved  in the conspiracy\r\n\nuntil  he became a government informant  and witness and that\r\n\nhe was murdered in order to prevent him from testifying.  GIL\r\n\ndirectors,  including  Hung  and  Chong,  allegedly  tried to\r\n\ndissuade  Chui from cooperating with  the ICAC.   We need not\r\n\nreach  the  issue of  whether the  statement of  a declarant,\r\n\nmurdered  to keep him from testifying, might be admissible at\r\n\na criminal trial in  the United States, cf. United  States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nHoulihan,  92  F.3d  1271   (1st  Cir.  1996),  whatever  the\r                    \r\n\nconsequence   of   these   facts   under   Hong   Kong   law.\r\n\nNevertheless,  we note that the Chui  statement might well be\r\n\nadmissible  under United  States law  as a  statement against\r\n\n                             -48-\r                                          48\r\r\n\ninterest.  See Fed. R. Evid. 804(b)(3).  The magistrate judge\r                          \r\n\ncorrectly ruled that the two statements were not unreliable.\r\n\n          One final  argument need not  detain us long.   Lui\r\n\nargues, from  his counsel's tactical decision  not to present\r\n\nhis  testimony  at  the  extradition  hearing,  that  he  was\r\n\nprecluded  from testifying.   He  argues that  the magistrate\r\n\njudge  drew an  unfavorable  inference, in  violation of  his\r\n\nFifth  Amendment rights, from  his failure  to testify.   The\r\n\nargument  misapprehends what happened.   The magistrate judge\r\n\ndid no such  thing.   Lui presented testimony  from Hung  and\r\n\nfive  other   affiants,  as  well  as   argument  of  counsel\r\n\nattempting to explain the payments and loans.  The magistrate\r\n\njudge  disbelieved  the explanation,  as  it  was within  his\r\n\ndiscretion to do.  There is nothing in this objection.\r\n\n          For these  reasons we  reverse the grant  of habeas\r\n\ncorpus  by the  district court.   We  continue in  effect the\r\n\nrequirement that Lui be held without bail.  If Lui  wishes to\r\n\nfile a petition for rehearing and/or a petition for rehearing\r\n\nen banc with  this court,  he must do  so within 14  calendar\r\n\ndays.  See Fed.  R. App. P. 40(a) &amp;  35(c).  We stay,  in any\r                      \r\n\nevent, delivery  of the  certification of  extraditability to\r\n\nthe  Secretary of State during this 14 calendar day period to\r\n\npermit  Lui to  seek relief  from the  United States  Supreme\r\n\nCourt.\r\n\n          So ordered.\r\n\n                             -49-\r                                          49\r\r\n",

Lui's petition for habeas  corpus was\r\n\npremised on the fact that  the reversion of Hong Kong to  the\r\n\nPeople's Republic of China  will take place on July  1, 1997,\r\n\nand it  will be impossible for the Crown Colony to try and to\r\n\npunish Lui before that date.  The United States  appeals.  We\r\n\nreverse  the order of the district court granting the writ of\r\n\nhabeas corpus.\r\n\n          The  United States  argues that  Lui is  within the\r\n\nliteral terms of the  extradition treaties between the United\r\n\nStates and the United  Kingdom, that the courts may  not vary\r\n\nfrom the language of the treaties, and that the certification\r\n\nmust issue.   Lui argues  that the language  of the  treaties\r\n\ndoes  not permit  extradition,  an argument  which is  surely\r\n\nwrong.   Lui's more serious  argument is that  the Senate, in\r\n\napproving the treaties, did not mean to permit extradition of\r\n\nsomeone to  be tried and  punished by a  government different\r\n\nfrom the  government which has  given its  assurances in  the\r\n\ntreaties.  \r\r\n\n          Lui  does not  claim that  he faces  prosecution in\r\n\nHong Kong on  account of his race, religion,  nationality, or\r\n\npolitical opinion.   He does not  claim to be charged  with a\r\n\npolitical offense.   The treaties give  the courts a  greater\r\n\nrole  when  such considerations  are  present.   Here,  Lui's\r\n\nposture is that of  one charged with an ordinary crime.   His\r\n\nclaim is  that  to surrender  him  now to  Hong  Kong is,  in\r\n\neffect, to send him  to trial and punishment in  the People's\r\n\nRepublic of  China.  The  Senate, in approving  the treaties,\r\n\ncould  not have intended such a result, he argues, and so the\r\n\ncourt should interpret the  treaties as being inapplicable to\r\n\nhis case.  Absent a treaty permitting extradition, he argues,\r\n\nhe may not be extradited.\r\n\n          While Lis it persuasive.  The Senate was well aware\r\n\nof the reversion when it approved a supplementary treaty with\r\n\nthe United Kingdom  in 1986.   The Senate  could easily  have\r\n\nsought language to address  the reversion of Hong Kong  if it\r\n\nwere  concerned,  but  did not  do  so.    The President  has\r\n\nrecently executed  a new treaty with  the incoming government\r\n\nof  Hong Kong, containing the same guarantees that Lui points\r\n\nto  in  the  earlier  treaties,  and  that  treaty  has  been\r\n\nsubmitted  to the  Senate.  In  addition, governments  of our\r\n\ntreaty partners often change, sometimes by  ballot, sometimes\r\n\nby revolution  or other means,  and the  possibility or  even\r\n\ncertainty of  such change  does not itself  excuse compliance\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nwith  the  terms of  the agreement  embodied in  the treaties\r\n\nbetween the countries.  Treaties contain  reciprocal benefits\r\n\nand  obligations.    The  United  States  benefits  from  the\r\n\ntreaties  at   issue  and,   under  their  terms,   may  seek\r\n\nextradition  to the date of  reversion of those  it wants for\r\n\ncriminal offenses.\r\n\n          Fundamental  principles  in our  American democracy\r\n\nlimit the role of courts in certain matters, out of deference\r\n\nto the  powers allocated by the Constitution to the President\r\n\nand to the  Senate, particularly  in the  conduct of  foreign\r\n\nrelations.   Those  separation  of  powers  principles,  well\r\n\nrehearsed in extradition law,  preclude us from rewriting the\r\n\ntreaties which  the President  and the Senate  have approved.\r\n\nThe  plain language  of the  treaties does  not support  Lui.\r\n\nUnder the treaties  as written,  the courts may  not, on  the\r\n\nbasis of the  reversion, avoid certifying to the Secretary of\r\n\nState  that Lui may be  extradited.  The  decision whether to\r\n\nsurrender  Lui,  in  light  of  his  arguments,  is  for  the\r\n\nSecretary of State to make.\r\n\n          This is not to say American courts acting under the\r\n\nwrit of habeas corpus, itself guaranteed in the Constitution,\r\n\nhave no independent  role.  There  is the ultimate  safeguard\r\n\nthat  extradition  proceedings  before  United  States courts\r\n\ncomport  with the Due Process Clause of the Constitution.

Some future case may, on  facts amounting to\r\n\na  violation of  constitutional guarantees,  warrant judicial\r\n\nintervention.  This case does not.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n          We repeat  the facts essentially as  we stated them\r\n\nin  our earlier opinion.   United States v.

(\"GIL\")  or GIL's  subsidiary, Wing  Wah Company\r\n\n(\"WWC\").    Lui, formerly  a senior  officer  of the  Brown &amp;\r\n\nWilliamson  Co., was  \"seconded\"  in 1990  to its  affiliated\r\n\ncompany, the  British American  Tobacco Co. (Hong  Kong) Ltd.\r\n\n(\"BAT-HK\"), where he became Director of Exports in 1992.  The\r\n\ncharges  result  from  an  investigation  by  the  Hong  Kong\r\n\nIndependent Commission Against Corruption (\"ICAC\").  The Hong\r\n\nKong authorities charge  that GIL  and WWC,  to which  BAT-HK\r\n\ndistributed  cigarettes, paid  bribes  in excess  of HK  $100\r\n\nmillion  (approximately US $14 to $15 million) to a series of\r\n\nBAT-HK executives, including Lui.   The bribes were allegedly\r\n\ngiven in exchange  for a  virtual monopoly on  the export  of\r\n\ncertain  brands of  cigarettes  to the  People's Republic  of\r\n\nChina  (\"PRC\")   and  to   Taiwan.    Among   the  cigarettes\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\ndistributed  were the  popular Brown  &amp; Williamson  brands of\r\n\nKent,  Viceroy,  and  Lucky  Strike.   GIL  purchased  three-\r\n\nquarters  of a  billion dollars  in cigarettes  from 1991  to\r\n\n1994, mostly from BAT-HK.\r\n\n           A  former GIL  shareholder, Chui  To-Yan (\"Chui\"),\r\n\ncooperated  with the authorities and, it  is said, would have\r\n\nprovided evidence  of Lui's  acceptance of  bribes.  Some  of\r\n\nLui's alleged co-conspirators attempted to dissuade Chui from\r\n\ncooperating.     Chui  was   later  abducted,  tortured,  and\r\n\nmurdered.  The ICAC  claims that the murder was  committed to\r\n\nstop Chui from testifying.  Lui  is not charged in the murder\r\n\nconspiracy.    Lui  was  in the  Philippines  (which  has  no\r\n\nextradition treaty with  Hong Kong) on  a business trip  when\r\n\nthe Hong  Kong authorities unsuccessfully sought  to question\r\n\nhim in April  1994.  Lui has not returned  to Hong Kong since\r\n\nthen. \r\n\n          At the request of the United Kingdom (\"UK\"), acting\r\n\non behalf of Hong  Kong, United States marshals arrested  Lui\r\n\nas  he got off a plane at  Boston's Logan Airport on December\r\n\n20, 1995.  The arrest was for the  purpose of extraditing Lui\r\n\nto Hong Kong.1   The  government asked that  Lui be  detained\r\n\npending  completion  of  the  extradition proceedings.

The most recent warrant for Lui's arrest from the Hong\r\nKong authorities is dated February 5, 1996; there were\r\nearlier warrants.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nmagistrate judge, after a hearing, denied Lui's request to be\r\n\nreleased on bail.\r\n\n          The district court, on April 25, 1996, reversed the\r\n\norder  of the magistrate judge  and released Lui  on bail and\r\n\nconditions.

The district\r\n\ncourt reasoned that, because  the Crown Colony could  not try\r\n\nLui and punish him before the reversion date, the extradition\r\n\ntreaty  between  the  United  States and  the  UK,  which  is\r\n\napplicable to Hong Kong, prohibited extradition.

Because  no  extradition treaty  between the  United\r\n\nStates and the new government of Hong Kong has been confirmed\r\n\nby the United States Senate, the district court reasoned, the\r\n\nmagistrate    judge    lacked    jurisdiction   to    certify\r\n\nextraditability.

See 18 U.S.C. ch. 209.\r                                                      \r\n\nThe statute  establishes a  two-step procedure  which divides\r\n\nresponsibility  for extradition  between a  judicial officer7\r\n\nand  the Secretary of  State.  The  judicial officer's duties\r\n\nare set  out in  18 U.S.C.    3184.   In brief,  the judicial\r\n\nofficer,  upon complaint,  issues  an arrest  warrant for  an\r\n\nindividual sought for extradition,  provided that there is an\r\n\nextradition treaty between the United States and the relevant\r\n\nforeign government  and that the crime charged  is covered by\r\n\nthe  treaty.   See id.   If  a warrant  issues, the  judicial\r                                  \r\n\nofficer then conducts a hearing to determine if \"he deems the\r\n\nevidence   sufficient  to  sustain   the  charge   under  the\r\n\nprovisions  of  the proper  treaty.\"   Id.   If  the judicial\r                                                      \r\n\nofficer makes such a determination, he \"shall certify\" to the\r                                                         \r\n\nSecretary  of State that a  warrant for the  surrender of the\r\n\nrelator \"may  issue.\"   Id. (emphases added).   The  judicial\r                                       \r\n\nofficer is  also directed to  provide the Secretary  of State\r\n\nwith  a   copy  of  the  testimony  and   evidence  from  the\r\n\nextradition hearing.

The judicial officer may be any federal judge, any\r\nauthorized magistrate, or any state judge of a court of\r\ngeneral jurisdiction.

The \"act of state\" doctrine, the Supreme Court\r\nhas said, \"arises out of the basic relationships between\r\nbranches of government in a system of separation of powers. \r\nIt concerns the competency of dissimilar institutions to make\r\nand implement particular kinds of decisions in the area of\r\ninternational relations.\"  Banco Nacional de Cuba v.\r                                                             \r\nSabbatino, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106775\"><a href=\"/opinion/106775/banco-nacional-de-cuba-v-sabbatino/\"><span class=\"volume\">376</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 423 (1964).  This court has doubted,\r                     \r\nin dicta, that the rule of non-inquiry is constitutionally\r\nmandated.  Howard, 996 F.2d at 1330 n.6.  Whether the\r                             \r\ndoctrine is constitutionally mandated is immaterial here.\r\n\n12.  Nor is it true, as Lui suggests, that the rule of non-\r\ninquiry is only appropriate where the existence of a treaty\r\nreflects a substantive judgment about the fairness of another\r\nnation's procedures.  The United States has maintained, over\r\ntime, extradition treaties with some of the world's most\r\noppressive and arbitrary regimes.  See 18 U.S.C.   3181\r                                                  \r\n(listing treaties of extradition and dates entered into). \r\nThe rule of non-inquiry expresses no judgment about a foreign\r                                                \r\nnation's ability and willingness to provide justice; it\r\nsimply defers that assessment to the second part of every\r\nextradition proceeding -- review of extraditability and\r\ndetermination of the appropriateness of surrender by the\r\nSecretary of State.  Indeed, a leading commentator, in\r\ndiscussing the scope of the Secretary's discretion under 18\r\nU.S.C.   3186, has argued that it is precisely \"because of\r                                                                      \r\nthe rule of non-inquiry\" that it is appropriate for the\r\nSecretary to exercise discretion on humanitarian grounds.  II\r\nBassiouni, supra, at 602 (emphasis added).\r                            \r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\n          Lui contends  that, on July 1,  1997, the reversion\r\n\nof Hong Kong to the PRC will result in his being subjected to\r\n\ntrial and punishment by a regime with which the United States\r\n\nhas no extradition  treaty.  This  future event, Lui  argues,\r\n\noperates retroactively  to render his extradition illegal, as\r                                                                         \r\n\nof today,  because, he  says, extradition is  only legitimate\r                    \r\n\nwhere trial and punishment will be administered by the regime\r\n\nwith which the United States has a treaty.  \r\n\n          Although Lui  is  correct that  the government  has\r\n\nconceded  that he will not  be tried before  reversion, it is\r\n\nalso quite  possible that  the scenario he  depicts will  not\r\n\narise.   The  new extradition  treaty with  the HKSAR  may be\r\n\napproved  by   the  United  States  Senate,   establishing  a\r\n\ncontinuity  of treaties  through and  beyond July  1, 1997.13\r\n\nThe United States government may choose to extend the current\r\n\nTreaty by executive  agreement.14  To  the extent that  Lui's\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n13.  The government does not argue that, absent any other\r\naction and of their own accord, the Treaties would continue\r\nbeyond reversion to apply to Hong Kong.  Accordingly, on the\r\nfacts of this case, we find the discussion of the state\r\nsuccession doctrine in Terlinden v.

Of course, the discussion in\r\nTerlinden of the rule of non-inquiry is relevant, and\r                     \r\nsupports our analysis.\r\n\n14.  It may be argued that this alternative infringes upon\r\nthe Senate's prerogative, under the Treaty Clause, U.S.\r\nConst., art. II,   2, to give its advice and consent.  But it\r\nis hardly an appropriate judicial task to attempt to resolve\r\na hypothetical and not ripe dispute between the legislature\r\nand the executive.\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\nargument depends on the fairness of the procedures he will be\r\n\nsubjected to,  he asks this court to decide that the PRC will\r\n\nnot adhere to the Joint Declaration  with the UK, in which it\r\n\ndeclared its  intention to maintain Hong  Kong's legal system\r\n\nfor fifty years.\r\n\n          All  of these  questions involve  an evaluation  of\r\n\ncontingent political events.  The Supreme Court has said that\r\n\nthe indicia of a non-justiciable political question include: \r\n\n          a  textually demonstrable  constitutional\r\n          commitment  of the issue  to a coordinate\r\n          political  department;  or   a  lack   of\r\n          judicially  discoverable  and  manageable\r\n          standards  for  resolving   it;  or   the\r\n          impossibility  of   deciding  without  an\r\n          initial  policy  determination of  a kind\r\n          clearly  for  nonjudicial discretion;  or\r\n          the    impossibility    of   a    court's\r\n          undertaking     independent    resolution\r\n          without  expressing  lack of  respect due\r\n          coordinate branches of government;  or an\r\n          unusual need  for unquestioning adherence\r\n          to a political decision already  made; or\r\n          the  potentiality  of embarrassment  from\r\n          multifarious  pronouncements  by  various\r\n          departments on one question.\r\n\nBaker v.

While  not all of\r                          \r\n\nthese ingredients  are present here, several  are.  Moreover,\r\n\nunlike  many \"political questions,\"  whose resolution, absent\r\n\njudicial  determination,  must  await  the  vagaries  of  the\r\n\npolitical  process, here  there is  a statutory  scheme which\r\n\nprovides  for  the  resolution   of  these  questions  by  an\r\n\nidentified  member of  the  executive branch.   The  case for\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\njudicial  resolution  is  thus  weaker than  with  many  such\r\n\nquestions.\r\n\n          The   principles   of   reciprocity   and   liberal\r\n\nconstruction  also counsel against construing the Treaties so\r\n\nas to  prohibit Lui's  extradition.   Hong Kong,  through the\r\n\nUnited  Kingdom,  has  entered bilateral  treaties  with  the\r\n\nUnited  States.  The United  States has sought extradition of\r\n\ncriminals  from  Hong  Kong in  the  past,  and  may wish  to\r\n\ncontinue to  do so up until  July 1, 1997.   If the executive\r\n\nchooses  to modify or abrogate the terms of the Treaties that\r\n\nit negotiated, it has ample discretion to do so.  However, if\r\n\nthis court were to read a cut-off date vis-a-vis extraditions\r\n\nto  Hong Kong into the Treaties, it would risk depriving both\r\n\nparties of the benefit of their bargain.\r\n\n          None  of  these principles,  including non-inquiry,\r\n\nmay be regarded as an absolute.  We, like the Second Circuit,\r\n\n\"can imagine situations where the relator, upon  extradition,\r\n\nwould be subject to  procedures or punishment so antipathetic\r\n\nto  a  federal  court's  sense  of   decency  as  to  require\r\n\nreexamination of the principle[s]\"  discussed above.

This is not such\r                     \r\n\na  case.    Lui  is  wanted  for  economic,  not   political,\r\n\nactivities  whose  criminality  is  fully  recognized in  the\r\n\nUnited States.  His extradition is sought by the current Hong\r                                                                    \r\n\nKong regime, a colony of Great Britain, which, as Lui himself\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\npoints  out,  is one  of this  country's most  trusted treaty\r\n\npartners.  Moreover, Lui  has been a fugitive from  Hong Kong\r\n\nsince  1994.    He  has been  subject  to  extradition  since\r\n\nentering the United States in December 1995.  That now only a\r\n\nfew months remain before the reversion of Hong Kong is partly\r\n\nattributable to strategic choices made by Lui himself.  There\r\n\nis nothing here which shocks the conscience of this court.\r\n\nB.  The Treaties\r                            \r\n\n          There  is   no   dispute  that   the   Treaty,   as\r\n\nsupplemented  by the  Supplementary  Treaty, is  currently in\r\n\neffect and is applicable  to Hong Kong.  The  district court,\r\n\nin granting Lui's habeas petition, reasoned that \"the Treaty,\r\n\nby its  own terms, does not allow the extradition of a person\r\n\nto Hong  Kong if the Crown  Colony of Hong Kong  is unable to\r\n\ntry and to punish that person.\"   Lui Habeas, --- F.

The government counters that the\r\n\nterms of the Treaty clearly  allow Lui's extradition.   There\r\n\nis nothing in the  plain language of the Treaties  that would\r\n\npermit  the  construction made  by the  district court.

Overview\r                        \r\n\n          We begin our analysis of the Treaties with  a brief\r\n\noverview of the Treaties' operative provisions.

I.\r\n\n          Article   III   contains  the   \"dual  criminality\"\r\n\nrequirement, a  requirement that is \"central   to extradition\r\n\nlaw and  [one that] has  been embodied  either explicitly  or\r\n\nimplicitly  in  all prior  extradition  treaties  between the\r\n\nUnited States and Great Britain.\"  Brauch v.

The political offense exception in\r                            \r\n\nthe Treaty  prohibits extradition where \"(i)  the offense for\r\n\nwhich extradition  is requested is regarded  by the requested\r\n\nParty as one  of a  political character; or  (ii) the  person\r\n\nsought proves  that the  request for  his extradition has  in\r\n\nfact  been  made with  a view  to try  or  punish him  for an\r\n\noffense of a political character.\"  Treaty, art. V(1)(c).\r\n\n          The Supplementary Treaty  narrows the  availability\r\n\nof this political  offense exception.   It lists  a range  of\r\n\ncrimes -- all crimes  of violence -- that may not be regarded\r\n\nas  political  offenses  for   the  purpose  of  raising  the\r\n\npolitical offense exception.

We add only our thoughts directed to the specialty\r\n\nclause itself.\r\n\n          If Lui's position were correct,  the enforceability\r\n\nof  many extradition treaties to which the United States is a\r\n\nparty would be thrown into grave doubt.

However, the issue was fully  briefed and\r\n\nargued  to the district court.  The record is complete.  This\r\n\nis  a habeas corpus appeal,  in which the  district court was\r\n\nnot  the fact finder but had  only a review function over the\r\n\nfindings  made by the magistrate  judge.

(citing\r\n\ncases).  The Supplementary Treaty defines probable cause:\r\n\n               Probable  cause means  whether there\r\n          is sufficient evidence  to warrant a  man\r\n          of  reasonable  caution  in   the  belief\r\n          that . . . an offense  has been committed\r\n          by the accused.\r\n\nSupplementary Treaty, art. 2.   The actual trial, if  any, is\r\n\nin  the foreign  court,  and it  is not  the  purpose of  the\r\n\nextradition  hearing to  determine  whether the  evidence  is\r\n\nsufficient  to justify conviction.   Thus it  is the probable\r\n\ncause determination which is subject to our review.\r\n\n          There is no  dispute that payments  of over HK  $21\r\n\nmillion (approximately US $3  million) and unsecured loans of\r\n\nHK $10 million  (approximately US $1.4 million)  were made to\r\n\n                             -38-\r                                          38\r\r\n\nLui, that the payments  were made into foreign  bank accounts\r\n\nin Lui's name, and  that the payments were not  made directly\r\n\nby check but  through a series of steps which  made them more\r\n\ndifficult  to trace.    There is  also  no dispute  that  the\r\n\npayments  were  made on  the dates  charged.   The  timing is\r\n\nsignificant.  The payments  coincided with the knowledge that\r\n\nLui was being  considered as Director  of Exports for  BAT-HK\r\n\nand with his  appointment to  that position in  1992.19   The\r\n\nloans  were  made  within three  days  of  Lui's  leaving his\r\n\nemployment  at  Brown &amp;  Williamson and  BAT-HK.   It  is not\r\n\ncontested that BAT-HK was the major supplier of cigarettes to\r\n\nGIL and WWC, that Brown  &amp; Williamson prohibits its employees\r\n\nfrom  accepting \"inducements\"  from those  with whom  it does\r\n\nbusiness and requires disclosure  statements to be completed,\r\n\nand that Lui failed to disclose any of these payments  on his\r\n\ndisclosure form.   The dispute between the government and Lui\r\n\nis basically over the purpose of these payments.\r\n\n          Two  competing theories  explaining the  purpose of\r\n\nthe payments were  presented to  the magistrate  judge.   The\r\n\ngovernment argued  that the  payments were bribes.   Although\r\n\nLui  had no  burden to  produce any evidence  at all  and the\r\n\nburden  of  showing probable  cause  rested  entirely on  the\r\n\ngovernment, Lui did present an  explanation for the loans and\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n19.  The one exception to this was the October 1988 payment\r\nalleged in Count II, as to which the magistrate judge found a\r\nlack of probable cause.\r\n\n                             -39-\r                                          39\r\r\n\npayments,  primarily  in  the  affidavit  of  Hung  Wing  Wah\r\n\n(\"Hung\"),  a former GIL director and sole proprietor of GIL's\r\n\nsubsidiary,  WWC.20  In essence, Hung said that, in or around\r\n\n1987, prior  to Lui's employment with Brown  &amp; Williamson, he\r\n\nand Lui  first began discussing \"cigarette business matters.\"\r\n\nHung  stated that  these  discussions eventually  led to  the\r\n\nestablishment of a profitable  business relationship in which\r\n\nHung  purchased  Japanese cigarettes  and  resold  them at  a\r\n\nprofit for  the account of  Chen Ying-Jen (\"Chen\"),  a former\r\n\nGIL principal.  The  payments to Lui's foreign  bank accounts\r\n\nwere filtered through Chen's account.\r\n\n          Hung stated  he was told  by Chen that,  because of\r\n\nthe   substantial   profits   generated   by   the   business\r\n\nrelationship Lui had been  instrumental in establishing, Chen\r\n\nhad agreed to pay  Lui for his assistance and  would continue\r\n\npaying Lui as  long as the relationship continued to generate\r\n\nsuch substantial profits.  Hung indicated that  the sums paid\r\n\nto  Lui bore  a reasonable  relationship to the  magnitude of\r\n\nChen's profits.  And finally, Hung  stated that the unsecured\r\n\nshort term  loans  had been  made to  Lui so  that Lui  could\r\n\ninvest  in the  then-booming Hong  Kong stock  market.   Hung\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n20.  Lui chose not to testify on his own behalf, as was his\r\nprerogative.  The magistrate judge properly excluded the\r\npolygraph evidence offered by Lui to corroborate his\r\ntestimony.  The polygraph evidence was not relevant, there\r\nbeing no such testimony in evidence to corroborate.  Whether\r\nit would be admissible if he did testify, we do not address.\r\n\n                             -40-\r                                          40\r\r\n\nstated  that  both the  principal  and  interest were  repaid\r\n\nshortly after the loans were made.  During the hearing before\r\n\nthe magistrate judge, Lui's  counsel indicated that Lui would\r\n\ntestify, and described  what that testimony  would be.   This\r\n\ndescription  matched  the  testimony  given  by  Hung.    Lui\r\n\nultimately declined to testify.\r\n\n          Lui  argued  that  the  government's  evidence  was\r\n\ninsufficient  to support  an  inference of  bribery and  that\r\n\nthere  was,  in  any event,  an  innocent  explanation.   The\r\n\ngovernment argued  that the undisputed  facts were sufficient\r\n\nto  establish probable  cause, and  that the  explanation was\r\n\ninherently implausible.   In addition, the government argued,\r\n\nit  had  two \"smoking  gun\"  statements  directly saying  the\r\n\npayments  were bribes.  We return to these two statements and\r\n\nLui's attack on them later.\r\n\n          The magistrate judge concluded that the explanation\r\n\nproffered  by  Lui's  counsel  --  \"to  the effect  that  the\r\n\npayments represented a gratuitous gesture of gratitude by one\r\n\nof   GIL's  former   principals  for   Lui's   assistance  in\r\n\nintroducing him to a supplier of Japanese cigarettes in 1987,\r\n\nsome six years  before the  last payments were  made\" --  was\r\n\ninherently implausible.

Without consideration of\r\n\nthe two  \"smoking gun\"  statements, the magistrate  judge was\r\n\nfully warranted in finding probable cause.\r\n\n          In addition,  the two statements, which  Lui argues\r\n\nwere  inadmissible,  were properly  admitted at  the probable\r\n\ncause stage  of the extradition hearing and further support a\r\n\nfinding of probable cause.\r\n\n          The  first  statement   was  given  to   Hong  Kong\r\n\ninvestigators  in July 1994 by Chui, one of Lui's alleged co-\r\n\nconspirators.   Chui was one  of the principals  of GIL until\r\n\nApril 1993.   In his  statement, Chui implicated  himself and\r\n\nother principals  of GIL in a scheme  to bribe Lui and others\r\n\nto  secure favorable allocations  of cigarettes  from BAT-HK.\r\n\nAccording to Chui, GIL  began paying bribes to Lui  when they\r\n\nfirst   anticipated  that  Lui  might  eventually  become  an\r\n\nimportant  BAT-HK   decisionmaker.    Chui  was  murdered  in\r\n\nSingapore nine months after giving this statement.\r\n\n          The second  statement was made by  Francis McNamara\r\n\nHaddon-Cave, who worked with  Chui.  Haddon-Cave testified in\r\n\nHong  Kong  in October  1995 at  a  hearing to  determine the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\noversight.

Haddon-Cave testified that he was hired by Chui to work\r\n\nas  a consultant for GIL  and began working  there in October\r\n\n1992.   One of  Haddon-Cave's responsibilities was  to foster\r\n\nrelationships between  GIL and  major suppliers  like BAT-HK.\r\n\nHaddon-Cave testified  that Chui  told him in  Lui's presence\r\n\nthat Lui  was \"our man\" and an important link with GIL.  Lui,\r\n\nthen  BAT-HK's Director of Exports, did not deny it.  Haddon-\r\n\nCave further testified that later, outside of Lui's presence,\r\n\nChui  told him  that Lui  was \"on  the take\"  and had  become\r\n\nwealthy as a result of the payments that distributors made to\r\n\nhim to secure favorable allocations of cigarettes.  \r\n\n          The  framework  for  determining  admissibility  of\r\n\nevidence  here is  determined  by the  Treaty  itself and  by\r\n\nUnited   States  legal   rules  governing   admissibility  in\r\n\nextradition proceedings.      Pursuant  to  federal  statute,\r\n\ndocuments offered as evidence in an extradition hearing:\r\n\n          shall   be   received  and   admitted  as\r\n          evidence  . . . for  all the  purposes of\r\n          such  hearing if  they shall  be properly\r\n          and  legally  authenticated   so  as   to\r\n          entitle them  to be received  for similar\r\n          purposes by the tribunals of  the foreign\r\n          country  from  which  the  accused  party\r\n          shall have escaped . . . .\r\n\n                             -43-\r                                          43\r\r\n\n18  U.S.C.    3190.22   Proof of  such authentication  is the\r\n\ncertificate  of the principal  diplomatic or consular officer\r\n\nof the United States  resident in such foreign country.   Id.\r                                                                         \r\n\nAdditionally, article VII(5) of  the Treaty provides that any\r\n\nevidence given upon oath or affirmation \"shall be received in\r\n\nevidence in  any proceedings for  extradition\" if it  is duly\r\n\nauthenticated.   Treaty, art.  VII(5).  Both  the Haddon-Cave\r\n\ntestimony  and  the  Chui  statement meet  this  authenticity\r\n\nrequirement  and  were  thus  admissible  at the  extradition\r\n\nhearing by the terms of the relevant statute and treaties.\r\n\n          Lui argues nonetheless that the two statements were\r\n\nimproperly  admitted because  they would  be  inadmissible at\r\n\ntrial under  Hong Kong law.  Lui argues that it is inherently\r\n\nunfair to certify  that he  is extraditable on  the basis  of\r\n\nevidence that  would be inadmissible  in the  court where  he\r\n\nwould  face trial.  He  also argues that  failure to consider\r\n\nthe  Hong  Kong  High  Court's  declaratory  judgment  (later\r\n\nreversed) that the Chui statement would be inadmissible would\r\n\nevince great disrespect for the judicial system of Hong Kong.\r\n\nBoth of these arguments are misplaced.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n22.  Lui does not rely on the language of 18 U.S.C.   3190. \r\nMost courts reviewing the language have concluded that   3190\r\nrequires only that the evidence meet any authentication\r\nrequirement imposed by a foreign tribunal, not that it be\r\nadmissible, much less that it be admissible at trial.

An extradition  hearing does not\r\n\nrequire  a higher standard of evidence  than a probable cause\r\n\nhearing.    The special  and  limited  nature of  extradition\r\n\nhearings  is  manifested  in  a  more  lenient  standard  for\r\n\nadmissibility  of evidence.    Neither the  Federal Rules  of\r\n\nCriminal Procedure, see  Fed. R. Crim.  P. 54(b)(5), nor  the\r                                   \r\n\nFederal  Rules of  Evidence,  see Fed.  R.

So  American domestic law has already resolved\r\n\nagainst  Lui  any   claim  that  there  is   a  violation  of\r\n\nConstitutional rights from the admission of hearsay  evidence\r\n\n                             -45-\r                                          45\r\r\n\nat  a probable cause hearing  which would not  be admitted at\r\n\ntrial.\r\n\n          Under Hong Kong law, the Haddon-Cave statement  and\r\n\nthe Chui statement present separate and distinct issues.  The\r\n\nHaddon-Cave statement was ruled inadmissible at the Hong Kong\r\n\ntrial of Chong Tsoi-Jun (\"Chong\"), an alleged co-conspirator,\r\n\non an objection that  it was not  made in furtherance of  the\r\n\nconspiracy.\r\n\n          As to  the Chui statement,  a Hong Kong  High Court\r\n\njudge   issued  a   declaration   that  the   statement   was\r\n\ninadmissible  hearsay.   On appeal,  the  Hong Kong  Court of\r\n\nAppeal vacated this ruling, finding  that Lui's request for a\r\n\ndeclaratory  judgment was  not justiciable  in the  Hong Kong\r\n\ncourts, but  that even if it  were, the judge's grant  of the\r\n\ndeclaration  would be an abuse  of discretion.   The Court of\r\n\nAppeal reasoned that  the issue of  the admissibility of  the\r\n\nChui statement in the extradition proceeding was a matter for\r\n\nthe United States court to decide.  The court noted, however,\r\n\nthat the  parties agreed that the  statement was inadmissible\r\n\nhearsay under  Hong  Kong law.   In  light of  the Hong  Kong\r\n\ncourt's  statement   that  the  admissibility  of   the  Chui\r\n\nstatement in  the extradition  hearing  is a  matter for  the\r\n\nUnited  States court  to decide,  admission of  the statement\r\n\ninto evidence  cannot be viewed as a sign of disrespect for a\r\n\nsister court.\r\n\n                             -46-\r                                          46\r\r\n\n          The focus on admissibility is, we think, misplaced,\r\n\nboth  based  on  these  facts and  on  larger,  institutional\r\n\nconcerns about the operation  of habeas corpus in extradition\r\n\ncertifications.   While in Manzi we  \"recognized that serious\r                                            \r\n\ndue process concerns may merit review beyond the narrow scope\r\n\nof inquiry  in extradition proceedings,\" there  is no serious\r\n\ndue process issue here.

Lui's  liberty  interests  are\r                   \r\n\nprotected  by  the very  existence  of  \"an unbiased  hearing\r\n\nbefore an independent judiciary.\"   In re Kaine, 55  U.S. (14\r                                                           \r\n\nHow.) 103 (1852).  \r\n\n          Inherent  in the  probable  cause  standard is  the\r\n\nnecessity  of  a  determination  that the  evidence  is  both\r\n\nsufficiently reliable and of sufficient weight to warrant the\r\n\nconclusion.    The  probable  cause standard  does  not  even\r\n\nrequire   that  the   government  make   its  showing   by  a\r\n\npreponderance of  the evidence.  But neither is it toothless.\r\n\nAll evidence does not  have the same importance even if it is\r\n\nauthentic and admissible.  For example, a confession obtained\r\n\nby duress is inherently unreliable  and would be given little\r\n\nweight even  if the confession were authenticated.   See Gill\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Imundi, 747 F.  Supp. 1028, 1042-47 (S.D.N.Y. 1990).   The\r                     \r\n\nreliability of  the evidence is  a factor  for the  reviewing\r\n\ncourt   to  consider  as  well,  and  potentially  unreliable\r\n\n                             -47-\r                                          47\r\r\n\nevidence  may  be  accorded  reduced  weight  by  the  court.\r\n\nRestatement, supra,   478.\r                              \r\n\n          No such  concerns about reliability  are implicated\r\n\nhere.    First,   the  statements  themselves   were  neither\r\n\ninvoluntary  nor  obtained under  questionable circumstances.\r\n\nFurther, the  Hong  Kong  courts  did not  rule  that  either\r\n\nstatement  was   untrue  or  otherwise  cast   doubt  on  the\r\n\nstatements'   credibility.     Each  statement   was  thought\r\n\ninadmissible in  Hong Kong on grounds  pertaining to hearsay.\r\n\nThe Haddon-Cave statement was deemed inadmissible because  it\r\n\ndid not meet one  of the requirements for admissibility  of a\r\n\nco-conspirator's statement.  The  Chui statement was  thought\r\n\ninadmissible because  the declarant was dead.   The Hong Kong\r\n\ngovernment alleges  that Chui was involved  in the conspiracy\r\n\nuntil  he became a government informant  and witness and that\r\n\nhe was murdered in order to prevent him from testifying.  GIL\r\n\ndirectors,  including  Hung  and  Chong,  allegedly  tried to\r\n\ndissuade  Chui from cooperating with  the ICAC.   We need not\r\n\nreach  the  issue of  whether the  statement of  a declarant,\r\n\nmurdered  to keep him from testifying, might be admissible at\r\n\na criminal trial in  the United States, cf. United  States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nHoulihan,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196936\"><a href=\"/opinion/196936/united-states-v-houlihan/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>  <span class=\"page\">1271</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">   (1st  Cir.  1996),  whatever  the\r                    \r\n\nconsequence   of   these   facts   under   Hong   Kong   law.\r\n\nNevertheless,  we note that the Chui  statement might well be\r\n\nadmissible  under United  States law  as a  statement against\r\n\n                             -48-\r                                          48\r\r\n\ninterest.  See Fed. R. Evid. 804(b)(3).  The magistrate judge\r                          \r\n\ncorrectly ruled that the two statements were not unreliable.\r\n\n          One final  argument need not  detain us long.   Lui\r\n\nargues, from  his counsel's tactical decision  not to present\r\n\nhis  testimony  at  the  extradition  hearing,  that  he  was\r\n\nprecluded  from testifying.   He  argues that  the magistrate\r\n\njudge  drew an  unfavorable  inference, in  violation of  his\r\n\nFifth  Amendment rights, from  his failure  to testify.   The\r\n\nargument  misapprehends what happened.   The magistrate judge\r\n\ndid no such  thing.   Lui presented testimony  from Hung  and\r\n\nfive  other   affiants,  as  well  as   argument  of  counsel\r\n\nattempting to explain the payments and loans.  The magistrate\r\n\njudge  disbelieved  the explanation,  as  it  was within  his\r\n\ndiscretion to do.  There is nothing in this objection.\r\n\n          For these  reasons we  reverse the grant  of habeas\r\n\ncorpus  by the  district court.   We  continue in  effect the\r\n\nrequirement that Lui be held without bail.  If Lui  wishes to\r\n\nfile a petition for rehearing and/or a petition for rehearing\r\n\nen banc with  this court,  he must do  so within 14  calendar\r\n\ndays.  See Fed.  R.
