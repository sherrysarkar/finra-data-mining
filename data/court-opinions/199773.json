Plaintiffs-appellants Thomas J.\n\nMacone and Frank Bramante, Trustees of the BRAMAC Development Trust,\n\nappeal from a grant of summary judgment for appellee, the Town of\n\nWakefield (\"Wakefield\"). Appellants brought suit against Wakefield\n\nalleging violations of the Federal Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3604,\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983, and the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of\n\nthe United States Constitution. These violations allegedly occurred\n\nwhen Wakefield rescinded its support for appellants' proposed\n\naffordable-housing project.     Upon appellee's motion for summary\n\njudgment, the district court found no material facts in dispute and,\n\nthereafter, ruled in appellee's favor as a matter of law.          We affirm.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          This suit arose out of appellants' dealings with Wakefield\n\nwhen appellants sought, obtained, and, subsequently, lost local backing\n\nfor a proposed residential housing development. As designed, the\n\ndevelopment, Hillside Estates, would consist of 133 to 160\n\ncondominiums, a significant percentage of which would be targeted to\n\nlow-income and minority families. It would be located on a 12.3 acre\n\nparcel of land in Wakefield which the appellants already owned and\n\nwhich had already been approved for a 28-lot subdivision by the\n\nWakefield Planning Board.    Appellants hoped to move this project\n\nthrough the Local Initiative Program (\"LIP\"), allowing them to bypass\n\nmany local zoning and regulatory hurdles.\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f          The Commonwealth of Massachusetts Department of Housing and\n\nCommunity Development (\"DHCD\") established LIP in order to provide\n\ncities and towns in Massachusetts with incentives to initiate the\n\nconstruction and sale of minority and low-income family housing. In\n\nfurtherance of that goal, LIP provides non-financial assistance and\n\nallows developers to obtain legal standing to appear before local\n\nZoning Boards of Appeals and request comprehensive permits. These\n\ncomprehensive permits potentially allow developers to circumvent local\n\nrequirements and regulations, including zoning laws.\n\n          As a first step in the LIP application process, a developer\n\nmust get the written endorsement of the chief elected official of the\n\nmunicipality where the project is proposed. In Wakefield, this is the\n\nBoard of Selectmen (\"Board\"). The involvement and support of local\n\nelected officials is important because proposed LIP developments enjoy\n\nstreamlined approval processes and participating municipalities may\n\nshare in the marketing and design of projects. While genuine local\n\nsupport is important, DHCD expects local officials to act in good faith\n\nand not unreasonably withhold support.\n\n          Additionally, Massachusetts has established a target goal\n\nthat ten percent of available housing stock in each community should be\n\naffordable.1 See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40B, § 20. Wakefield has never\n\n\n\n1 For the purposes of this opinion, affordable housing is defined as\nhousing that low- and moderate-income families can afford.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fachieved that target percentage. Rather, the percentage of affordable\n\nhousing in Wakefield hovers around 4.5 percent of the total available\n\nhousing.\n\n           According to LIP regulations, appellants sought approval for\n\nHillview Estates from the Board.       In their letter to the Board,\n\nappellants stated, \" It is important to note that in communities where\n\nthe percentage of available low to moderate income housing is below\n\n10%, the DHCD expects local support for LIP Program proposed housing.\"\n\n           On May 13, 1998, the Board voted to approve the Hillview\n\nEstates project proposed by appellants. Appellants suggest that the\n\nBoard originally gave this approval because it wanted to maintain some\n\ncontrol over the project, particularly over the type of residents.\n\nAccording to appellants, the Board feared that the project would be\n\nbuilt even without Wakefield's participation, in which case Wakefield\n\nwould have no local preference and, thus, no control over who would\n\nfill the low-income and minority units. They base that contention on\n\nthe statement of one Board member who said, in regard to the Hillview\n\nEstates development, \"I don't think that gives the flavor to what we\n\nwant in Wakefield and unfortunately - and I understand how the\n\nneighbors down there probably feel, I'm not sure that's what they're\n\ngoing to want to see at the end either.\"         In response to this\n\ncontention, all deposed Board members2 explained that their initial\n\n2   Appellants deposed all but one Board member.\n\n                                 -5-\n\fapproval stemmed from their concern that the town would suffer adverse\n\nconsequences, including a possible loss of funding from the state, if\n\nthey failed to approve all LIP proposals.\n\n          After the Board approved the Hillview Estates proposal,\n\nappellants submitted their application to DHCD. Pursuant to this\n\napplication, appellants met with DHCD representatives on November 5,\n\n1998. At that meeting, DHCD asked appellants to consider reducing the\n\nsize of the Hillview Estates project and obtain additional confirmation\n\nof Wakefield's support for the project. Therefore, on November 9,\n\n1998, appellants resubmitted the Hillview Estates proposal to the\n\nBoard, reducing the number of units by twenty.       Four days later,\n\nWakefield responded that the Board was happy to see that the number of\n\nunits had been reduced and that the Board continued to support the\n\nHillview Estates project.\n\n          On November 30, 1998, members of the Board met with DHCD\n\nrepresentatives to discuss LIP and related projects. At this meeting,\n\nit became clear to the Board that Wakefield would not suffer adverse\n\nconsequences from the simple failure to approve all LIP proposals. The\n\nDHCD representatives made clear that they believed that the Board had\n\nbeen making a good faith effort to comply with program goals.\n\n          In a letter dated December 21, 1998, DHCD informed the Board\n\nthat it had approved the Hillview Estates project. However, the letter\n\nalso noted that \"both the size of the proposed project and the density\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fper acre are greater than the size or density typically allowed by\n\n[DHCD] within the [LIP]. However since the [Board] has endorsed the\n\nHillview Estates [project] application, [DHCD] grants certification.\"\n\nThe letter also required that five of the affordable units be set aside\n\nfor minority applicants.\n\n          On March 8, 1999, the Board voted to rescind their prior\n\napproval of the Hillview Estates project. This vote occurred without\n\nany prior notice to appellants.     The next day, March 9, the Board\n\nnotified DHCD of the rescission and asked whether the Hillview Estates\n\nproject remained eligible to seek a comprehensive permit from the\n\nZoning Board of Appeals. The Board did not notify appellants of the\n\nrescission until two days after the vote, March 10. On March 19, 1999,\n\nDHCD cancelled its prior certification and site approval letter for the\n\nHillview Estates project, preventing appellants from obtaining a\n\ncomprehensive permit.\n\n                                 II.\n\n          We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de\n\nnovo after drawing all reasonable conclusions of fact in favor of the\n\nappellants. See Rubinovitz v. Rogato, 60 F.3d 906 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\nOnly if no genuine dispute of material fact exists will we affirm the\n\ngrant of summary judgment. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. Appellants are\n\n\"entitled to all inferences which are fairly supported by the evidence,\n\nbut are not permitted to build their case on mere 'opprobrious\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fepithets' of malice . . . or the 'gossamer threads of whimsey,\n\nspeculation and conjecture.'\" Creative Env'ts, Inc. v. Estabrook, 680\n\nF.2d 822, 830 (1st Cir. 1982) (citations omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                -8-\n\f                                III.\n\n          Two of appellants' claims are brought under the Federal Fair\n\nHousing Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-3631. They allege that the Board, by\n\nrescinding its support for the Hillview Estates project, violated the\n\nFair Housing Act.   To prove a violation of the Fair Housing Act,\n\nappellants can show either discriminatory intent or disparate impact.\n\nSee Gamble v. City of Escondido, 104 F.3d 300, 304-05 (9th Cir. 1997).\n\nAppellants advance both theories here, so we address each in turn.\n\n                                 A.\n\n          Appellants argue that the Board and Wakefield intended to\n\neliminate thirty-four affordable and five minority-owned housing units\n\nwhen they rescinded their support for the Hillview Estates project. In\n\nsupport of this argument, appellants point to several pieces of\n\nevidence. First, at the original hearing granting approval, a Board\n\nmember said, \"I don't think that gives the flavor to what we want in\n\nWakefield.\" Second, appellants contend that the Board only approved\n\nthe project in an effort to take advantage of local preference\n\nprovisions of LIP. These local preference provisions would supposedly\n\nlimit the number of minorities accepted as residents of the Hillview\n\nEstates project. Third, the revocation was admittedly a substantial\n\ndeparture from normal procedures.      This departure includes the\n\nunannounced reconsideration of the Hillview Estates proposal and the\n\nallegation that one Board member orchestrated the unprecedented\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\frescission. Fourth, appellants declare that this same Board member\n\nnotified the DHCD that he would file an appeal on behalf of local\n\nresidents if appellants received a comprehensive permit. Fifth is the\n\nrelated point that local officials allegedly assisted in local\n\nopposition to the Hillview Estates project. Sixth, the Board failed to\n\nstate any reasons for its decision at the time of rescission and later\n\npointed to facts which were properly before the Zoning Board of\n\nAppeals. Such reliance is allegedly questionable because the Board did\n\nnot have the factual background to adequately assess the project and\n\nbecause the Zoning Board of Appeals was more than equipped to deal with\n\nthose issues.    Finally, the Board knew that its decision would\n\neliminate thirty-four affordable and five minority-owned housing units\n\nfrom being built in Wakefield.\n\n          None of the facts pointed to by appellants demonstrates any\n\ndiscriminatory intent, except for arguably the \"flavor\" comment. Even\n\nif we grant appellants that this comment betrays a racial concern by\n\none Board member, we still cannot find that this one comment supports\n\nappellants' contention that the earlier rescission was racially\n\nmotivated. First, this comment was made months earlier, during a\n\nhearing where the Board voted to support the Hillview Estates project.\n\nSecond, appellants can point to no other evidence which supports a\n\nfinding of discriminatory intent on the part of the Board.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f          Appellants suggest that they have sufficient corroborating\n\nevidence of discriminatory intent, but we disagree.       Most of the\n\narguments raised by the appellants relate to the procedural\n\nabnormalities surrounding the Board's rescission.3 While procedural\n\nabnormalities can provide a basis for finding discriminatory intent,\n\nsee Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S.\n\n252, 267 (1977) (\"Departures from the normal procedural sequence also\n\nmight afford evidence that improper purposes are playing a role.\"),\n\nsuch abnormalities are only relevant within a larger scope. Id. Here,\n\nappellants can point only to the \"flavor\" comment, made months earlier,\n\nto create that larger context. Additionally, appellants would have us\n\nignore a whole host of events which occurred between the original\n\napproval and the rescission. Most importantly, the Board learned a\n\nsignificant amount about LIP and the Board's responsibilities under it.\n\nThis is an undisputed fact.\n\n          Appellants attempt to deal with the Board's increased\n\nknowledge by arguing that the additional information simply led the\n\nBoard to realize that it could entirely eliminate the Hillview Estates\n\nproject without penalty, not just limit its impact. This argument\n\n\n3  Appellants point to the fact that the vote was not previously\nscheduled and appellants received no notice of the vote. However,\nappellants also raise several related points which we consider\ntogether. These include the facts that an individual Board member\nthreatened to appeal any grant of a comprehensive permit, Board members\nallegedly assisted in local opposition to the Hillview Estates project,\nand the Board provided no reason for the rescission at the time.\n\n                                 -11-\n\fhinges on appellants' assertion that the Board originally approved the\n\nproject in order to take advantage of the local preference provisions\n\nof LIP,4 as this would supposedly limit the number of minority families\n\nmoving into Wakefield. However, there is no support in the record for\n\nthis assertion. The record of the Board meeting shows quite clearly\n\nthat the members were very concerned about the absolute level of\n\ndevelopment in the town. They were also afraid of losing control of\n\nthe project entirely and allowing appellants to bypass the local\n\nplanning process.    Finally, the Board members expressed a clear\n\ninterest in developing Wakefield so that residents could become\n\n\"lifelong\" residents, instead of being forced to leave at retirement,\n\nwhen their income might decrease.       None of the comments by Board\n\nmembers reflects any racial concerns, just legitimate concerns about\n\nthe amount and type of development.\n\n          The Board also received information regarding DHCD's\n\nexpectations. They learned that the Hillview Estates project was\n\nlarger and more dense than the typical projects approved under the LIP.\n\nIn fact, DHCD was quite clear that it had significant reservations\n\nabout the project and only granted its approval because of the Board's\n\nsupport for the project. Combining that knowledge with the fact that\n\n\n\n4 As represented in the record, the local preference provision allows\na community to require that up to 70 percent of the low- and moderate-\nincome units be granted preferentially to local residents or their\nrelatives.\n\n                                 -12-\n\fDHCD believed the Board and Wakefield to be working steadily toward\n\nproviding the target percentage of affordable housing, the evidence\n\nwould not support a finding that racial considerations drove the\n\nBoard's rescission.    Larger concerns about the Hillview Estates\n\nproposal predominated.\n\n          Finally, appellants argue that we should look to the Board's\n\nknowledge that its rescission would prevent affordable and minority-\n\nowned housing units from being built in Wakefield. While the Board may\n\nhave prevented these few units from being constructed, the Board also\n\nknows that it must continue to make progress toward the ten-percent\n\ngoal of affordable housing. Future projects may or may not include the\n\nlocal preference provision which was included in the Hillview Estates\n\nproposal. Therefore, the Board, if anything, faces a more uncertain\n\nfuture regarding the movement of minorities into Wakefield. If keeping\n\nminorities out of Wakefield were actually a concern for the Board,\n\nblocking the Hillview Estates project would hardly further that goal.\n\n          In this context, it is clear that the \"flavor\" comment does\n\nnot get appellants past summary judgment. See Nat'l Amusements, Inc.\n\nv. Town of Dedham, 43 F.3d 731, 743-44 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"While\n\nambiguous remarks may, under some circumstances, help to illuminate the\n\nsummary judgment record, such remarks rarely will suffice to conceive\n\nan issue of material fact when none otherwise exists.\"). We are not\n\nrequired to enter into the realm of fantasy and conjecture when\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\freviewing a grant of summary judgment, see id. at 735, and appellants\n\ncannot show discriminatory intent on such flimsy evidence. Therefore,\n\nthe district court properly granted summary judgment on the\n\ndiscriminatory intent claim.\n\n                                  B.\n\n          Another route to establishing a prima facie case of racial\n\ndiscrimination under the Fair Housing Act is to show that appellee's\n\nactions \"actually or predictably [result] in racial discrimination.\"\n\nUnited States v. City of Black Jack, 508 F.2d 1179, 1184 (8th Cir.\n\n1975). The important distinction here is that we look only at the\n\neffect of the Board's actions, not its motivation. See id. at 1185.\n\nAppellants argue that the Board's rescission of its support for the\n\nHillview Estates project has a discriminatory impact. However, we find\n\nthat appellants provide no evidence and can only speculate about any\n\nsuch impact. Therefore, we hold that they fail to establish a prima\n\nfacie case of discriminatory impact.\n\n          We begin by noting that the Federal Fair Housing Act\n\ncertainly imposes no affirmative obligation on municipalities to\n\napprove all proposed affordable or minority housing projects. See\n\nVill. of Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 270-71 (holding that the simple\n\nfailure of the village to rezone property, so that a low-income,\n\nracially diverse housing project could be built, did not violate the\n\nFair Housing Act). At the same time, municipalities cannot frustrate\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\fthe underlying policy of providing fair housing within their\n\ncommunities. See Smith v. Town of Clarkton, 682 F.2d 1055, 1068 (4th\n\nCir. 1982). Therefore, actions that have a discriminatory effect can\n\nviolate the Fair Housing Act.\n\n          In trying to show a discriminatory effect, appellants rely\n\nheavily on City of Black Jack, but the case before us fails to present\n\nsimilar evidence. 508 F.2d at 1179. There, the record contained\n\nextensive information regarding the racial segregation of the immediate\n\narea. Id.; see also Kennedy Park Homes Ass'n v. City of Lackawanna,\n\n436 F.2d 108, 113 (2d Cir. 1970) (relying on evidence of blatant\n\nsegregation within the defendant city in affirming the judgment against\n\nthe city). The court also found that this racial segregation was the\n\nresult of \"deliberate racial discrimination in the housing market.\"\n\nCity of Black Jack, 508 F.2d at 1186.     We have no such comparable\n\ninformation here.\n\n          Appellant would have us look exclusively to the fact that\n\nWakefield is a predominately white community. However, they present no\n\ninformation regarding the surrounding area and certainly no information\n\nabout historical patterns of racial housing discrimination in the\n\nWakefield area. The fact that a community is not racially integrated\n\ndoes not automatically mean that we will find a violation of the Fair\n\nHousing Act. Arlington Heights had 27 black residents out of a total\n\npopulation of 64,000 when the village refused to rezone a parcel of\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fland to accommodate a proposed low-income housing development. Vill.\n\nof Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 255. Yet, the Supreme Court found no\n\nviolation of the Fair Housing Act.       Id.\n\n          Appellants also fail to address an even more salient\n\ndistinction between their case and City of Black Jack.      In City of\n\nBlack Jack, plaintiffs presented \"ample proof\" of minority interest in\n\nthe blocked development. 508 F.2d at 1179.         Here, there is no\n\ninformation that any minorities would actually move into the Hillview\n\nEstates project. At best, appellants can point to the requirement that\n\nfive of the affordable units be set aside for minority applicants.\n\nThere is no assurance that any minority applicants would appear or that\n\nany would actually secure housing in Hillview Estates. In short, there\n\nis absolutely no proof that any minority would actually be denied\n\nhousing in Wakefield due to the Board's rescission of its approval for\n\nthe Hillview Estates project. Therefore, we find that appellants have\n\nfailed to produce sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case\n\nof discriminatory impact under the Fair Housing Act and that the\n\ndistrict court properly granted summary judgment on this count.\n\n                                 IV.\n\n          Appellants also brought a variety of constitutional claims.\n\nFirst, they allege that the Board's actions deprived them of property\n\nwithout due process of law. Second, appellants allege that the Board's\n\nactions were arbitrary, capricious and confiscatory, violating their\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\fsubstantive due process rights. Finally, they allege that the Board's\n\nactions deprived them of equal protection of the laws. All of these\n\nclaims were brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. We address these claims\n\nbelow and find that, for each, appellants fail to present sufficient\n\nevidence to survive a motion for summary judgment.\n\n          To bring a successful section 1983 action, appellants must\n\nestablish two elements: (1) the conduct complained of was carried out\n\nunder color of state law and (2) this conduct deprived appellants of\n\nrights, privileges or immunities secured by the Constitution or laws of\n\nthe United States. See Chiplin Enters. v. City of Lebanon, 712 F.2d\n\n1524, 1526-27 (1st Cir. 1983). There is no question that the first\n\nrequirement is met here, so we proceed to the second element for each\n\nof appellants' claims.\n\n                                  A.\n\n          First, we address the due process concerns raised by\n\nappellants.    To establish a due process claim, substantive or\n\nprocedural, appellants must first establish a property interest. See\n\nBd. of Regents of State Colls. v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 569-70 (1972).\n\nThey contend that because the Board issued three written indications of\n\nsupport for the Hillview Estates project, they had a property interest\n\nin the Board's support which triggers due process rights. Appellants\n\nalso point to the fact that the Board knew they had spent thousands of\n\ndollars in continuing to develop the Hillview Estates proposal.\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\f          However, the discretionary nature of the Board's act in\n\nrescinding its approval negates any entitlement claim asserted by\n\nappellants. See Bd. of Regents, 408 U.S. at 577 (\"To have a property\n\ninterest in a benefit, a person clearly must have more than an abstract\n\nneed or desire for it. He must have more than a unilateral expectation\n\nof it. He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to\n\nit.\"). We have consistently rejected substantive due process claims\n\narising out of disputes between developers and land planning\n\nauthorities while leaving the door \"slightly ajar\" for \"truly\n\nhorrendous situations.\" Néstor Colón Medina & Sucesores, Inc. v.\n\nCustodio, 964 F.2d 32, 45 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n          Simply put, appellants cannot demonstrate a property interest\n\nin the Board's prior approval of the Hillview Estates project. The\n\nrecord contains nothing but evidence that local approval of LIP\n\nprojects is entirely discretionary. Additionally, appellants had not\n\neven obtained the comprehensive permit which they sought. This simple\n\nfact distinguishes their case from that of Acorn Ponds at North Hills\n\nv. Inc. Vill. of North Hills, 623 F. Supp. 688 (E.D.N.Y. 1985), on\n\nwhich appellants rely. There, a district court distinguished the case\n\nwhere all permits had issued and construction was largely complete from\n\nthe case where building permits had not been granted. Id. at 692.\n\nWhen a developer has actually constructed a structure with the\n\nappropriate permits, the court found that a property right may attach.\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\fId. In contrast, here, there is simply no evidence that appellants\n\nwould have obtained a comprehensive permit and been allowed to continue\n\nwith their development, much less begun any construction. Furthermore,\n\nany support from the Board and any money expended by appellants would\n\nhave failed to move the project along had such a permit been denied.\n\nTherefore, appellants fall far short of showing any cognizable property\n\ninterest.\n\n            On the substantive due process element, it is true that we\n\nhave left the door open in truly horrendous situations. See Néstor\n\nColón Medina, 964 F.2d at 45. However, this is not such a case. As\n\ndiscussed above, there is no indication that the Board acted with any\n\ndiscriminatory intent. In fact, the evidence shows only that the Board\n\nwas legitimately concerned about the impact of this large development\n\non Wakefield.\n\n            Because appellants fail to show any property interest and\n\ncannot demonstrate that the Board acted improperly in revoking its\n\nprior support, the district court properly granted summary judgment to\n\nthe Board on the due process counts.\n\n                                  B.\n\n            Finally, we address appellants' equal protection claim.\n\nHere, we look for two elements: (1) whether the appellant was treated\n\ndifferently than others similarly situated, and (2) whether such a\n\ndifference was based on an impermissible consideration, such as race.\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fSee Rubinovitz, 60 F.3d at 909-10 (citing Yerardi's Moody St. Rest. &\n\nLounge, Inc. v. Bd. of Selectmen, 878 F.2d 12, 21 (1st Cir. 1989)).\n\nAppellants allege that they were treated differently than other LIP\n\ndevelopments based on the Board's desire to exclude minority residents\n\nfrom Wakefield.\n\n          On appeal, appellants argue exclusively that the district\n\ncourt erred when it found that appellants had not been treated\n\ndifferently than others similarly situated.           In making this\n\ndetermination, the district court found that Hillview Estates was not\n\nsimilarly situated in comparison to other LIP developments in Wakefield\n\ndue to its larger size. Appellants contend that such a finding by the\n\ndistrict court simply allows the Board to continue denying larger\n\nprojects, thereby furthering its allegedly discriminatory purpose.\n\nSimply put, this argument fails to get appellants anywhere. Regardless\n\nof whether the district court erred in holding that appellants were not\n\nsimilarly situated to other LIP developers, appellants fail to present\n\nany evidence to support their claim that the Board acted with\n\ndiscriminatory intent, as discussed above. Absent such a showing,\n\nappellants cannot make out either a due process or an equal protection\n\nclaim.   See Rubinovitz, 60 F.3d at 909-10.\n\n          Additionally, we note our extreme reluctance to entertain\n\nequal protection challenges to local planning decisions:\n\n\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\f          Every appeal by a disappointed developer from an\n          adverse ruling by a local Massachusetts planning\n          board necessarily involves some claim that the\n          board exceeded, abused, or \"distorted\" its legal\n          authority in some manner, often for some\n          allegedly perverse (from the developer's point of\n          view) reason. It is not enough simply to give\n          these state law claims constitutional labels such\n          as \"due process\" or \"equal protection\" in order\n          to raise a substantial federal question under\n          section 1983.\n\nCreative Env'ts, Inc., 680 F.2d at 833; see also Néstor Colón Medina,\n\n964 F.2d at 44-45 (citing Vill. of Belle Terre v.

Plaintiffs-appellants Thomas J.\n\nMacone and Frank Bramante, Trustees of the BRAMAC Development Trust,\n\nappeal from a grant of summary judgment for appellee, the Town of\n\nWakefield (\"Wakefield\"). Appellants brought suit against Wakefield\n\nalleging violations of the Federal Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3604,\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983, and the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of\n\nthe United States Constitution. These violations allegedly occurred\n\nwhen Wakefield rescinded its support for appellants' proposed\n\naffordable-housing project.     Upon appellee's motion for summary\n\njudgment, the district court found no material facts in dispute and,\n\nthereafter, ruled in appellee's favor as a matter of law.          We affirm.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          This suit arose out of appellants' dealings with Wakefield\n\nwhen appellants sought, obtained, and, subsequently, lost local backing\n\nfor a proposed residential housing development. As designed, the\n\ndevelopment, Hillside Estates, would consist of 133 to 160\n\ncondominiums, a significant percentage of which would be targeted to\n\nlow-income and minority families. It would be located on a 12.3 acre\n\nparcel of land in Wakefield which the appellants already owned and\n\nwhich had already been approved for a 28-lot subdivision by the\n\nWakefield Planning Board.    Appellants hoped to move this project\n\nthrough the Local Initiative Program (\"LIP\"), allowing them to bypass\n\nmany local zoning and regulatory hurdles.\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f          The Commonwealth of Massachusetts Department of Housing and\n\nCommunity Development (\"DHCD\") established LIP in order to provide\n\ncities and towns in Massachusetts with incentives to initiate the\n\nconstruction and sale of minority and low-income family housing. In\n\nfurtherance of that goal, LIP provides non-financial assistance and\n\nallows developers to obtain legal standing to appear before local\n\nZoning Boards of Appeals and request comprehensive permits. These\n\ncomprehensive permits potentially allow developers to circumvent local\n\nrequirements and regulations, including zoning laws.\n\n          As a first step in the LIP application process, a developer\n\nmust get the written endorsement of the chief elected official of the\n\nmunicipality where the project is proposed. In Wakefield, this is the\n\nBoard of Selectmen (\"Board\"). The involvement and support of local\n\nelected officials is important because proposed LIP developments enjoy\n\nstreamlined approval processes and participating municipalities may\n\nshare in the marketing and design of projects. While genuine local\n\nsupport is important, DHCD expects local officials to act in good faith\n\nand not unreasonably withhold support.\n\n          Additionally, Massachusetts has established a target goal\n\nthat ten percent of available housing stock in each community should be\n\naffordable.1 See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 40B, § 20. Wakefield has never\n\n\n\n1 For the purposes of this opinion, affordable housing is defined as\nhousing that low- and moderate-income families can afford.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fachieved that target percentage. Rather, the percentage of affordable\n\nhousing in Wakefield hovers around 4.5 percent of the total available\n\nhousing.\n\n           According to LIP regulations, appellants sought approval for\n\nHillview Estates from the Board.       In their letter to the Board,\n\nappellants stated, \" It is important to note that in communities where\n\nthe percentage of available low to moderate income housing is below\n\n10%, the DHCD expects local support for LIP Program proposed housing.\"\n\n           On May 13, 1998, the Board voted to approve the Hillview\n\nEstates project proposed by appellants. Appellants suggest that the\n\nBoard originally gave this approval because it wanted to maintain some\n\ncontrol over the project, particularly over the type of residents.\n\nAccording to appellants, the Board feared that the project would be\n\nbuilt even without Wakefield's participation, in which case Wakefield\n\nwould have no local preference and, thus, no control over who would\n\nfill the low-income and minority units. They base that contention on\n\nthe statement of one Board member who said, in regard to the Hillview\n\nEstates development, \"I don't think that gives the flavor to what we\n\nwant in Wakefield and unfortunately - and I understand how the\n\nneighbors down there probably feel, I'm not sure that's what they're\n\ngoing to want to see at the end either.\"         In response to this\n\ncontention, all deposed Board members2 explained that their initial\n\n2   Appellants deposed all but one Board member.\n\n                                 -5-\n\fapproval stemmed from their concern that the town would suffer adverse\n\nconsequences, including a possible loss of funding from the state, if\n\nthey failed to approve all LIP proposals.\n\n          After the Board approved the Hillview Estates proposal,\n\nappellants submitted their application to DHCD. Pursuant to this\n\napplication, appellants met with DHCD representatives on November 5,\n\n1998. At that meeting, DHCD asked appellants to consider reducing the\n\nsize of the Hillview Estates project and obtain additional confirmation\n\nof Wakefield's support for the project. Therefore, on November 9,\n\n1998, appellants resubmitted the Hillview Estates proposal to the\n\nBoard, reducing the number of units by twenty.       Four days later,\n\nWakefield responded that the Board was happy to see that the number of\n\nunits had been reduced and that the Board continued to support the\n\nHillview Estates project.\n\n          On November 30, 1998, members of the Board met with DHCD\n\nrepresentatives to discuss LIP and related projects. At this meeting,\n\nit became clear to the Board that Wakefield would not suffer adverse\n\nconsequences from the simple failure to approve all LIP proposals. The\n\nDHCD representatives made clear that they believed that the Board had\n\nbeen making a good faith effort to comply with program goals.\n\n          In a letter dated December 21, 1998, DHCD informed the Board\n\nthat it had approved the Hillview Estates project. However, the letter\n\nalso noted that \"both the size of the proposed project and the density\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fper acre are greater than the size or density typically allowed by\n\n[DHCD] within the [LIP]. However since the [Board] has endorsed the\n\nHillview Estates [project] application, [DHCD] grants certification.\"\n\nThe letter also required that five of the affordable units be set aside\n\nfor minority applicants.\n\n          On March 8, 1999, the Board voted to rescind their prior\n\napproval of the Hillview Estates project. This vote occurred without\n\nany prior notice to appellants.     The next day, March 9, the Board\n\nnotified DHCD of the rescission and asked whether the Hillview Estates\n\nproject remained eligible to seek a comprehensive permit from the\n\nZoning Board of Appeals. The Board did not notify appellants of the\n\nrescission until two days after the vote, March 10. On March 19, 1999,\n\nDHCD cancelled its prior certification and site approval letter for the\n\nHillview Estates project, preventing appellants from obtaining a\n\ncomprehensive permit.\n\n                                 II.\n\n          We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de\n\nnovo after drawing all reasonable conclusions of fact in favor of the\n\nappellants.

To prove a violation of the Fair Housing Act,\n\nappellants can show either discriminatory intent or disparate impact.\n\nSee Gamble v. City of Escondido, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"732529\"><a href=\"/opinion/732529/john-gamble-fie-a-gamble-life-care-residences-inc-doing-business-as-oak/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 304-05 (9th Cir. 1997).\n\nAppellants advance both theories here, so we address each in turn.\n\n                                 A.\n\n          Appellants argue that the Board and Wakefield intended to\n\neliminate thirty-four affordable and five minority-owned housing units\n\nwhen they rescinded their support for the Hillview Estates project. In\n\nsupport of this argument, appellants point to several pieces of\n\nevidence. First, at the original hearing granting approval, a Board\n\nmember said, \"I don't think that gives the flavor to what we want in\n\nWakefield.\" Second, appellants contend that the Board only approved\n\nthe project in an effort to take advantage of local preference\n\nprovisions of LIP. These local preference provisions would supposedly\n\nlimit the number of minorities accepted as residents of the Hillview\n\nEstates project. Third, the revocation was admittedly a substantial\n\ndeparture from normal procedures.      This departure includes the\n\nunannounced reconsideration of the Hillview Estates proposal and the\n\nallegation that one Board member orchestrated the unprecedented\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\frescission. Fourth, appellants declare that this same Board member\n\nnotified the DHCD that he would file an appeal on behalf of local\n\nresidents if appellants received a comprehensive permit. Fifth is the\n\nrelated point that local officials allegedly assisted in local\n\nopposition to the Hillview Estates project. Sixth, the Board failed to\n\nstate any reasons for its decision at the time of rescission and later\n\npointed to facts which were properly before the Zoning Board of\n\nAppeals. Such reliance is allegedly questionable because the Board did\n\nnot have the factual background to adequately assess the project and\n\nbecause the Zoning Board of Appeals was more than equipped to deal with\n\nthose issues.    Finally, the Board knew that its decision would\n\neliminate thirty-four affordable and five minority-owned housing units\n\nfrom being built in Wakefield.\n\n          None of the facts pointed to by appellants demonstrates any\n\ndiscriminatory intent, except for arguably the \"flavor\" comment. Even\n\nif we grant appellants that this comment betrays a racial concern by\n\none Board member, we still cannot find that this one comment supports\n\nappellants' contention that the earlier rescission was racially\n\nmotivated. First, this comment was made months earlier, during a\n\nhearing where the Board voted to support the Hillview Estates project.\n\nSecond, appellants can point to no other evidence which supports a\n\nfinding of discriminatory intent on the part of the Board.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f          Appellants suggest that they have sufficient corroborating\n\nevidence of discriminatory intent, but we disagree.       Most of the\n\narguments raised by the appellants relate to the procedural\n\nabnormalities surrounding the Board's rescission.3 While procedural\n\nabnormalities can provide a basis for finding discriminatory intent,\n\nsee Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109573\"><a href=\"/opinion/109573/arlington-heights-v-metropolitan-housing-development-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 267 (1977) (\"Departures from the normal procedural sequence also\n\nmight afford evidence that improper purposes are playing a role.\"),\n\nsuch abnormalities are only relevant within a larger scope. Id. Here,\n\nappellants can point only to the \"flavor\" comment, made months earlier,\n\nto create that larger context. Additionally, appellants would have us\n\nignore a whole host of events which occurred between the original\n\napproval and the rescission. Most importantly, the Board learned a\n\nsignificant amount about LIP and the Board's responsibilities under it.\n\nThis is an undisputed fact.\n\n          Appellants attempt to deal with the Board's increased\n\nknowledge by arguing that the additional information simply led the\n\nBoard to realize that it could entirely eliminate the Hillview Estates\n\nproject without penalty, not just limit its impact. This argument\n\n\n3  Appellants point to the fact that the vote was not previously\nscheduled and appellants received no notice of the vote. However,\nappellants also raise several related points which we consider\ntogether. These include the facts that an individual Board member\nthreatened to appeal any grant of a comprehensive permit, Board members\nallegedly assisted in local opposition to the Hillview Estates project,\nand the Board provided no reason for the rescission at the time.\n\n                                 -11-\n\fhinges on appellants' assertion that the Board originally approved the\n\nproject in order to take advantage of the local preference provisions\n\nof LIP,4 as this would supposedly limit the number of minority families\n\nmoving into Wakefield. However, there is no support in the record for\n\nthis assertion. The record of the Board meeting shows quite clearly\n\nthat the members were very concerned about the absolute level of\n\ndevelopment in the town. They were also afraid of losing control of\n\nthe project entirely and allowing appellants to bypass the local\n\nplanning process.    Finally, the Board members expressed a clear\n\ninterest in developing Wakefield so that residents could become\n\n\"lifelong\" residents, instead of being forced to leave at retirement,\n\nwhen their income might decrease.       None of the comments by Board\n\nmembers reflects any racial concerns, just legitimate concerns about\n\nthe amount and type of development.\n\n          The Board also received information regarding DHCD's\n\nexpectations. They learned that the Hillview Estates project was\n\nlarger and more dense than the typical projects approved under the LIP.\n\nIn fact, DHCD was quite clear that it had significant reservations\n\nabout the project and only granted its approval because of the Board's\n\nsupport for the project. Combining that knowledge with the fact that\n\n\n\n4 As represented in the record, the local preference provision allows\na community to require that up to 70 percent of the low- and moderate-\nincome units be granted preferentially to local residents or their\nrelatives.\n\n                                 -12-\n\fDHCD believed the Board and Wakefield to be working steadily toward\n\nproviding the target percentage of affordable housing, the evidence\n\nwould not support a finding that racial considerations drove the\n\nBoard's rescission.    Larger concerns about the Hillview Estates\n\nproposal predominated.\n\n          Finally, appellants argue that we should look to the Board's\n\nknowledge that its rescission would prevent affordable and minority-\n\nowned housing units from being built in Wakefield. While the Board may\n\nhave prevented these few units from being constructed, the Board also\n\nknows that it must continue to make progress toward the ten-percent\n\ngoal of affordable housing. Future projects may or may not include the\n\nlocal preference provision which was included in the Hillview Estates\n\nproposal. Therefore, the Board, if anything, faces a more uncertain\n\nfuture regarding the movement of minorities into Wakefield. If keeping\n\nminorities out of Wakefield were actually a concern for the Board,\n\nblocking the Hillview Estates project would hardly further that goal.\n\n          In this context, it is clear that the \"flavor\" comment does\n\nnot get appellants past summary judgment.

Therefore, we hold that they fail to establish a prima\n\nfacie case of discriminatory impact.\n\n          We begin by noting that the Federal Fair Housing Act\n\ncertainly imposes no affirmative obligation on municipalities to\n\napprove all proposed affordable or minority housing projects. See\n\nVill. of Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 270-71 (holding that the simple\n\nfailure of the village to rezone property, so that a low-income,\n\nracially diverse housing project could be built, did not violate the\n\nFair Housing Act). At the same time, municipalities cannot frustrate\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\fthe underlying policy of providing fair housing within their\n\ncommunities. See Smith v. Town of Clarkton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"406173\"><a href=\"/opinion/406173/james-smith-v-the-town-of-clarkton-north-carolina-and-j-dwight-fort/\"><span class=\"volume\">682</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1055</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1068 (4th\n\nCir. 1982). Therefore, actions that have a discriminatory effect can\n\nviolate the Fair Housing Act.\n\n          In trying to show a discriminatory effect, appellants rely\n\nheavily on City of Black Jack, but the case before us fails to present\n\nsimilar evidence. 508 F.2d at 1179. There, the record contained\n\nextensive information regarding the racial segregation of the immediate\n\narea. Id.; see also Kennedy Park Homes Ass'n v. City of Lackawanna,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">108</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 113 (2d Cir. 1970) (relying on evidence of blatant\n\nsegregation within the defendant city in affirming the judgment against\n\nthe city). The court also found that this racial segregation was the\n\nresult of \"deliberate racial discrimination in the housing market.\"\n\nCity of Black Jack, 508 F.2d at 1186.     We have no such comparable\n\ninformation here.\n\n          Appellant would have us look exclusively to the fact that\n\nWakefield is a predominately white community. However, they present no\n\ninformation regarding the surrounding area and certainly no information\n\nabout historical patterns of racial housing discrimination in the\n\nWakefield area. The fact that a community is not racially integrated\n\ndoes not automatically mean that we will find a violation of the Fair\n\nHousing Act. Arlington Heights had 27 black residents out of a total\n\npopulation of 64,000 when the village refused to rezone a parcel of\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fland to accommodate a proposed low-income housing development. Vill.\n\nof Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 255. Yet, the Supreme Court found no\n\nviolation of the Fair Housing Act.       Id.\n\n          Appellants also fail to address an even more salient\n\ndistinction between their case and City of Black Jack.      In City of\n\nBlack Jack, plaintiffs presented \"ample proof\" of minority interest in\n\nthe blocked development. 508 F.2d at 1179.         Here, there is no\n\ninformation that any minorities would actually move into the Hillview\n\nEstates project. At best, appellants can point to the requirement that\n\nfive of the affordable units be set aside for minority applicants.\n\nThere is no assurance that any minority applicants would appear or that\n\nany would actually secure housing in Hillview Estates. In short, there\n\nis absolutely no proof that any minority would actually be denied\n\nhousing in Wakefield due to the Board's rescission of its approval for\n\nthe Hillview Estates project. Therefore, we find that appellants have\n\nfailed to produce sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case\n\nof discriminatory impact under the Fair Housing Act and that the\n\ndistrict court properly granted summary judgment on this count.\n\n                                 IV.\n\n          Appellants also brought a variety of constitutional claims.\n\nFirst, they allege that the Board's actions deprived them of property\n\nwithout due process of law. Second, appellants allege that the Board's\n\nactions were arbitrary, capricious and confiscatory, violating their\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\fsubstantive due process rights. Finally, they allege that the Board's\n\nactions deprived them of equal protection of the laws. All of these\n\nclaims were brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. We address these claims\n\nbelow and find that, for each, appellants fail to present sufficient\n\nevidence to survive a motion for summary judgment.\n\n          To bring a successful section 1983 action, appellants must\n\nestablish two elements: (1) the conduct complained of was carried out\n\nunder color of state law and (2) this conduct deprived appellants of\n\nrights, privileges or immunities secured by the Constitution or laws of\n\nthe United States. See Chiplin Enters. v. City of Lebanon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"422031\"><a href=\"/opinion/422031/chiplin-enterprises-inc-v-city-of-lebanon/\"><span class=\"volume\">712</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1524</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1526-27 (1st Cir. 1983). There is no question that the first\n\nrequirement is met here, so we proceed to the second element for each\n\nof appellants' claims.\n\n                                  A.\n\n          First, we address the due process concerns raised by\n\nappellants.    To establish a due process claim, substantive or\n\nprocedural, appellants must first establish a property interest. See\n\nBd. of Regents of State Colls. v. Roth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108608\"><a href=\"/opinion/108608/board-of-regents-of-state-colleges-v-roth/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 569-70 (1972).\n\nThey contend that because the Board issued three written indications of\n\nsupport for the Hillview Estates project, they had a property interest\n\nin the Board's support which triggers due process rights. Appellants\n\nalso point to the fact that the Board knew they had spent thousands of\n\ndollars in continuing to develop the Hillview Estates proposal.\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\f          However, the discretionary nature of the Board's act in\n\nrescinding its approval negates any entitlement claim asserted by\n\nappellants. See Bd. of Regents, 408 U.S. at 577 (\"To have a property\n\ninterest in a benefit, a person clearly must have more than an abstract\n\nneed or desire for it. He must have more than a unilateral expectation\n\nof it. He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to\n\nit.\"). We have consistently rejected substantive due process claims\n\narising out of disputes between developers and land planning\n\nauthorities while leaving the door \"slightly ajar\" for \"truly\n\nhorrendous situations.\" Néstor Colón Medina & Sucesores, Inc. v.\n\nCustodio, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583574\"><a href=\"/opinion/583574/nestor-colon-medina-sucesores-inc-v-patria-g-custodio/\"><span class=\"volume\">964</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 45 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n          Simply put, appellants cannot demonstrate a property interest\n\nin the Board's prior approval of the Hillview Estates project. The\n\nrecord contains nothing but evidence that local approval of LIP\n\nprojects is entirely discretionary. Additionally, appellants had not\n\neven obtained the comprehensive permit which they sought. This simple\n\nfact distinguishes their case from that of Acorn Ponds at North Hills\n\nv. Inc. Vill. of North Hills, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1514014\"><a href=\"/opinion/1514014/acorn-ponds-v-incorporated-village-of-north-hills/\"><span class=\"volume\">623</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">688</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (E.D.N.Y. 1985), on\n\nwhich appellants rely. There, a district court distinguished the case\n\nwhere all permits had issued and construction was largely complete from\n\nthe case where building permits had not been granted. Id. at 692.\n\nWhen a developer has actually constructed a structure with the\n\nappropriate permits, the court found that a property right may attach.\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\fId. In contrast, here, there is simply no evidence that appellants\n\nwould have obtained a comprehensive permit and been allowed to continue\n\nwith their development, much less begun any construction. Furthermore,\n\nany support from the Board and any money expended by appellants would\n\nhave failed to move the project along had such a permit been denied.\n\nTherefore, appellants fall far short of showing any cognizable property\n\ninterest.\n\n            On the substantive due process element, it is true that we\n\nhave left the door open in truly horrendous situations. See Néstor\n\nColón Medina, 964 F.2d at 45. However, this is not such a case. As\n\ndiscussed above, there is no indication that the Board acted with any\n\ndiscriminatory intent. In fact, the evidence shows only that the Board\n\nwas legitimately concerned about the impact of this large development\n\non Wakefield.\n\n            Because appellants fail to show any property interest and\n\ncannot demonstrate that the Board acted improperly in revoking its\n\nprior support, the district court properly granted summary judgment to\n\nthe Board on the due process counts.\n\n                                  B.\n\n            Finally, we address appellants' equal protection claim.\n\nHere, we look for two elements: (1) whether the appellant was treated\n\ndifferently than others similarly situated, and (2) whether such a\n\ndifference was based on an impermissible consideration, such as race.\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fSee Rubinovitz, 60 F.3d at 909-10 (citing Yerardi's Moody St. Rest. &\n\nLounge, Inc. v. Bd. of Selectmen, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">878</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 21 (1st Cir. 1989)).\n\nAppellants allege that they were treated differently than other LIP\n\ndevelopments based on the Board's desire to exclude minority residents\n\nfrom Wakefield.\n\n          On appeal, appellants argue exclusively that the district\n\ncourt erred when it found that appellants had not been treated\n\ndifferently than others similarly situated.           In making this\n\ndetermination, the district court found that Hillview Estates was not\n\nsimilarly situated in comparison to other LIP developments in Wakefield\n\ndue to its larger size. Appellants contend that such a finding by the\n\ndistrict court simply allows the Board to continue denying larger\n\nprojects, thereby furthering its allegedly discriminatory purpose.\n\nSimply put, this argument fails to get appellants anywhere. Regardless\n\nof whether the district court erred in holding that appellants were not\n\nsimilarly situated to other LIP developers, appellants fail to present\n\nany evidence to support their claim that the Board acted with\n\ndiscriminatory intent, as discussed above. Absent such a showing,\n\nappellants cannot make out either a due process or an equal protection\n\nclaim.   See Rubinovitz, 60 F.3d at 909-10.\n\n          Additionally, we note our extreme reluctance to entertain\n\nequal protection challenges to local planning decisions:\n\n\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\f          Every appeal by a disappointed developer from an\n          adverse ruling by a local Massachusetts planning\n          board necessarily involves some claim that the\n          board exceeded, abused, or \"distorted\" its legal\n          authority in some manner, often for some\n          allegedly perverse (from the developer's point of\n          view) reason. It is not enough simply to give\n          these state law claims constitutional labels such\n          as \"due process\" or \"equal protection\" in order\n          to raise a substantial federal question under\n          section 1983.\n\nCreative Env'ts, Inc., 680 F.2d at 833; see also Néstor Colón Medina,\n\n964 F.2d at 44-45 (citing Vill. of Belle Terre v.
