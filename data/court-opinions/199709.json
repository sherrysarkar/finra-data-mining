Petitioner-appellant Dev\n\nVrat Gupta is an engineer and former employee of respondent-\n\nappellee Cisco Systems, Inc.                At issue is the ownership of\n\nseveral million dollars’ worth of stock in Maxcomm Technologies,\n\nInc., a company Gupta founded while employed by Cisco.                           An\n\narbitrator issued an award upholding Cisco's right to repurchase\n\nthe     stock,    and     the   District      Court    for    the   District     of\n\nMassachusetts denied Gupta's motion to vacate the award.                         We\n\naffirm the decisions below.\n\n                                 I.   Background\n\n            Gupta began working for Cisco in July, 1997.               In March,\n\n1998, he founded Maxcomm.               Gupta remained employed by Cisco\n\nwhile     serving    as     Maxcomm's      President    and    Chief   Executive\n\nOfficer.     On July 17, 1998, the parties signed a Founder’s\n\nAgreement    in     which    Gupta,   in    exchange    for    financing,      gave\n\nMaxcomm or its successors the right to repurchase Gupta’s shares\n\nif he left Maxcomm before January of 2002.\n\n            On September 9, 1999, Gupta and Cisco entered into an\n\nEmployment Agreement. 1          The Employment Agreement contained an\n\nintegration clause providing that the Agreement superceded and\n\n\n      1\n     Cisco and Gupta had executed an earlier Employment\nAgreement on July 25, 1997, as well as a Proprietary Information\nand Invention Agreement and agreements concerning stock and\nstock options. None of these agreements is directly at issue in\nthis case.\n\n                                        -3-\n\freplaced all prior agreements between Gupta and Maxcomm, as well\n\nas Gupta and Cisco, \"relating to the subject matter hereof,\n\nincluding, but not limited to, any and all prior employment\n\nagreements.\" The integration clause explicitly excepted certain\n\nother agreements, but did not mention the Founder's Agreement.\n\nThe Employment Agreement also contained an arbitration clause\n\nand a choice-of-law provision specifying California law.\n\n            Also on September 9, 1999, Gupta signed an amendment\n\nto the Founder's Agreement referring to Maxcomm's right to\n\nrepurchase \"unvested shares\" in the event of the termination of\n\nhis employment.         The amendment provided, inter alia, that absent\n\nshareholder       approval       Gupta     \"shall     not   be    entitled       to   any\n\naccelerated       vesting       of   the     Shares    in   connection         with   the\n\nacquisition of the Company by Cisco.\"\n\n            On        September      13,     1999,    Cisco      acquired      Maxcomm.\n\nEffective that date, Maxcomm and Cisco entered into a Merger\n\nAgreement    providing,         inter      alia,     that   Cisco      could   exercise\n\nrepurchase rights equivalent to those held by Maxcomm under the\n\nFounder's Agreement.              Gupta had negotiated that contract on\n\nbehalf of Maxcomm, with the assistance of counsel.\n\n            On May 24, 2000, Gupta voluntarily resigned from his\n\nemployment       at    Cisco.        Cisco    repurchased        the   Maxcomm    stock\n\n\n\n\n                                             -4-\n\fpursuant to the Founder's Agreement and compensated Gupta for\n\nthe repurchased shares.\n\n            The matter proceeded to arbitration in April, 2000.\n\nThe arbitrator performed a \"contextual analysis\" in interpreting\n\nthe contract:        she examined several other contracts as well as\n\nthe plain language of the integration clause to determine the\n\nintent of the parties.2               She concluded that the integration\n\nclause    in   the    Employment       Agreement    covered    only   contracts\n\nrelating to employment; that the Founder’s Agreement did not\n\nrelate to employment; and hence that the Employment Agreement\n\ndid   not      replace   or     supercede     the     Founder’s       Agreement.\n\nAccordingly,      she    held    that     Cisco    retained    the    right   to\n\nrepurchase the Maxcomm stock.\n\n            Gupta filed suit under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9\n\nU.S.C. § 10, to vacate the arbitrator's award. On December 19,\n\n2000, the district court affirmed the award.\n\n                                II.    Discussion\n\n            Our review of an arbitrator's decision is “extremely\n\nnarrow and exceedingly deferential.”                 Keebler    Co. v. Truck\n\nDrivers, Local 170, 247 F.3d 8, 10 (1st Cir. 2001) (citation\n\nomitted); Bull HN Info. Sys., Inc. v. Hutson, 229 F.3d 321, 330\n\n\n      2\n     The arbitrator cited California law, pursuant to the\nchoice-of-law provision in the Employment Agreement, in support\nof this analysis.\n\n                                        -5-\n\f(1st Cir. 2000) (citation omitted).         We recently emphasized that\n\n“disputes that are committed by contract to the arbitral process\n\nalmost always are won or lost before the arbitrator.                 Successful\n\ncourt challenges are few and far between.”              Keebler, 247 F.3d at\n\n10 (quoting Teamsters Local Union No. 42 v. Supervalu, Inc., 212\n\nF.3d 59, 61 (1st Cir. 2000)) (interpreting collective bargaining\n\nagreement).    Indeed, \"judicial review of an arbitration award is\n\namong the narrowest known to the law.”           Coastal Oil v. Teamsters\n\nLocal A/W, 134 F.3d 466, 469 (1st Cir. 1998) (citation omitted).\n\n          In this Circuit, arbitral awards are subject to review\n\nonly in two relevant instances:          (1) where an award is contrary\n\nto the plain language of the contract or (2) where it is clear\n\nfrom the record that the arbitrator recognized the applicable\n\nlaw, but ignored it.      Bull HN Info. Sys., 229 F.3d at 330-31.\n\n\"In the parlance of this and other circuits, a reviewing court\n\nmay   vacate   an   arbitral   award   if   it    was    made   in   'manifest\n\ndisregard' of the law.\"        Id. at 331.       Thus, we will affirm the\n\narbitrator’s interpretation of the Employment Agreement if it is\n\nin any way plausible, even if we think she committed serious\n\nerror.   See Coastal Oil, 134 F.3d at 469; Dorado Beach Hotel\n\nCorp. v. Union de Trabajadores de La Industria Gastronomica de\n\nPuerto Rico Local 610, 959 F.2d 2, 4 (1st Cir. 1992).                  “[I]t is\n\nthe arbitrator’s view of the facts and of the meaning of the\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fcontract that [the parties] have agreed to accept.\"                   Bull HN\n\nInfo. Sys., 229 F.3d at 330 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            Gupta maintains that the arbitrator and district court\n\nerred in concluding that the Founder’s Agreement did not relate\n\nto employment.        He contends that the very purpose of that\n\nagreement was to secure his continued relationship with Cisco,\n\nand points out that his employment was explicitly mentioned\n\nseveral times therein.            This argument is not without force.\n\nWe are constrained, however, by the standard of review.                     See\n\nWheelabrator Envirotech Operating Serv. Inc. v. Mass. Laborers\n\nDist.     Council   Local   1144,    88   F.3d   40,   48   (1st   Cir.   1996)\n\n(affirming arbitrator’s award even though “as a matter of first\n\nimpression we might well have decided the case otherwise”).\n\nEven if we disagree with the arbitrator's interpretation of the\n\nintegration clause in the Employment Agreement, it does not\n\namount to manifest disregard of the law.                See Bull HN Info.\n\nSys., 229 F.3d at 330-31.           The arbitrator's determination that\n\nthe parties did not intend to cut off Cisco's repurchase rights\n\nis sufficiently grounded in the record such that we cannot say\n\nit   is    contrary   to    the   plain     language   of    the   Employment\n\nAgreement.      See id.      Nor is this a situation wherein the\n\narbitrator recognized but ignored the applicable law.                 See id.\n\nHence, we defer to her conclusion that the Employment Agreement\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fdoes not supercede or replace the Founder’s Agreement, and\n\naffirm the award in favor of Cisco.\n\n         Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                             -8-\n\f",

On July 17, 1998, the parties signed a Founder's Agreement in which Gupta, in exchange for financing, gave Maxcomm or its successors the right to repurchase Gupta's shares if he left Maxcomm before January of 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 9, 1999, Gupta and Cisco entered into an Employment Agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The Employment Agreement contained an integration clause providing that the Agreement superceded and replaced all prior agreements between Gupta and Maxcomm, as well as Gupta and Cisco, \"relating to the subject matter hereof, including, but not limited to, any and all prior employment agreements.\" The integration clause explicitly excepted certain other agreements, but did not mention the Founder's Agreement. The Employment Agreement also contained an arbitration clause and a choice-of-law provision specifying California law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also on September 9, 1999, Gupta signed an amendment to the Founder's Agreement referring to Maxcomm's right to repurchase \"unvested shares\" in the event of the termination of his employment. The amendment provided, inter alia, that absent shareholder approval Gupta \"shall not be entitled to any accelerated vesting of the Shares in connection with the acquisition of the Company by Cisco.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 13, 1999, Cisco acquired Maxcomm. Effective that date, Maxcomm and Cisco entered into a Merger Agreement providing, inter alia, that Cisco could exercise repurchase rights equivalent to those held by Maxcomm under the Founder's Agreement. Gupta had negotiated that contract on behalf of Maxcomm, with the assistance of counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 24, 2000, Gupta voluntarily resigned from his employment at Cisco. Cisco repurchased the Maxcomm stock pursuant to the Founder's Agreement and compensated Gupta for the repurchased shares.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The matter proceeded to arbitration in April, 2000. The arbitrator performed a \"contextual analysis\" in interpreting the contract: she examined several other contracts as well as the plain language of the integration clause to determine the intent of the parties.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> She concluded that the integration clause in the Employment Agreement covered only contracts relating to employment; that the Founder's Agreement did not relate to employment; and hence that the Employment Agreement did not replace or supercede the Founder's Agreement. Accordingly, she held that Cisco retained the right to repurchase the Maxcomm stock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gupta filed suit under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. &#167; 10, to vacate the arbitrator's award. On December 19, 2000, the district court affirmed the award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of an arbitrator's decision is \"extremely narrow and exceedingly deferential.\" Keebler Co. v. Truck Drivers, Local 170, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199381\"><a href=\"/opinion/199381/keebler-company-v-truck-drivers/\"><span class=\"volume\">247</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir. 2001) (citation omitted); Bull HN Info. Sys., Inc. v. Hutson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199116\"><a href=\"/opinion/199116/bull-hn-v-hutson/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span>, 330 (1st Cir. 2000) (citation omitted). We recently emphasized that \"disputes that are committed by contract to the arbitral process almost always are won or lost before the arbitrator. Successful court challenges are few and far between.\" Keebler, 247 F.3d at 10 (quoting Teamsters Local Union No. 42 v. Supervalu, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198927\"><a href=\"/opinion/198927/teamsters-local-v-supervalu-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span>, 61 (1st Cir. 2000)) (interpreting collective bargaining agreement). Indeed, \"judicial review of an arbitration award is among the narrowest known to the law.\" Coastal Oil v. Teamsters Local A/W, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751095\"><a href=\"/opinion/751095/coastal-oil-of-new-england-inc-v-teamsters-local-aw-international/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, 469 (1st Cir. 1998) (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this Circuit, arbitral awards are subject to review only in two relevant instances: (1) where an award is contrary to the plain language of the contract or (2) where it is clear from the record that the arbitrator recognized the applicable law, but ignored it. Bull HN Info. Sys., 229 F.3d at 330-31. \"In the parlance of this and other circuits, a reviewing court may vacate an arbitral award if it was made in 'manifest disregard' of the law.\" Id. at 331. Thus, we will affirm the arbitrator's interpretation of the Employment Agreement if it is in any way plausible, even if we think she committed serious error. See Coastal Oil, 134 F.3d at 469; Dorado Beach Hotel Corp. v. Union de Trabajadores de La Industria Gastronomica de Puerto Rico Local 610, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579482\"><a href=\"/opinion/579482/dorado-beach-hotel-corporation-v-union-de-trabajadores-de-la-industria/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">2</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir. 1992). \"[I]t is the arbitrator's view of the facts and of the meaning of the contract that [the parties] have agreed to accept.\" Bull HN Info. Sys., 229 F.3d at 330 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gupta maintains that the arbitrator and district court erred in concluding that the Founder's Agreement did not relate to employment. He contends that the very purpose of that agreement was to secure his continued relationship with Cisco, and points out that his employment was explicitly mentioned several times therein.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is not without force. We are constrained, however, by the standard of review. See Wheelabrator Envirotech Operating Serv. Inc. v. Mass. Laborers Dist. Council Local 1144, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"721304\"><a href=\"/opinion/721304/wheelabrator-envirotech-operating-services-incorporated-v-massachusetts/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span>, 48 (1st Cir. 1996) (affirming arbitrator's award even though \"as a matter of first impression we might well have decided the case otherwise\"). Even if we disagree with the arbitrator's interpretation of the integration clause in the Employment Agreement, it does not amount to manifest disregard of the law. See Bull HN Info. Sys., 229 F.3d at 330-31. The arbitrator's determination that the parties did not intend to cut off Cisco's repurchase rights is sufficiently grounded in the record such that we cannot say it is contrary to the plain language of the Employment Agreement. See id. Nor is this a situation wherein the arbitrator recognized but ignored the applicable law. See id. Hence, we defer to her conclusion that the Employment Agreement does not supercede or replace the Founder's Agreement, and affirm the award in favor of Cisco.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Cisco and Gupta had executed an earlier Employment Agreement on July 25, 1997, as well as a Proprietary Information and Invention Agreement and agreements concerning stock and stock options.
