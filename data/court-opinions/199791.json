MULDOON,\n\n                     Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                               v.\n\n                 C.J. MULDOON & SONS, ET AL.,\n\n                     Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n               FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n          [Hon. Joseph L. Tauro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                    Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                 Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                   and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Emmett S. Muldoon on brief pro se.\n     Christopher G. Betke and Ryan, Coughlin & Betke on brief for\nappellees.\n\n\n\n\n                        January 28, 2002\n\f          Per Curiam. Emmett S. Muldoon appeals from the\n\ndistrict court’s dismissal of his action for benefits under\n\nsection 510 of the Employees Retirement Income Security Act\n\n(ERISA), 29 U.S.C. § 1140, as time-barred (No. 01-1516) and\n\nfrom the district court’s denial of his subsequent motion to\n\namend the judgment (No. 01-1845).          The two appeals have\n\npreviously been consolidated by order of this court.\n\n          Because Congress did not provide a statute of\n\nlimitations in the ERISA statute for section 510 claims,\n\nfederal courts must apply the limitations period of the\n\nstate-law cause of action most analogous to the federal\n\nclaim.    Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S. 261, 266-67 (1985).\n\nMuldoon   contends   that   the   most   analogous   Massachusetts\n\nstatute is M.G.L.A. c. 260, § 2, which states:\n\n          Actions of contract, other than those to\n          recover for personal injuries, founded\n          upon contracts or liabilities, express\n          or implied, except actions limited by\n          section one or actions upon judgments or\n          decrees of courts of record of the\n          United States or of this or of any other\n          state of the United States, shall,\n          except   as   otherwise   provided,   be\n          commenced only within six years next\n          after the cause of action accrues.\n\fThe district court determined that Muldoon’s claim was more\n\nanalogous to M.G.L.A. c. 260, § 2A, which is entitled “Tort,\n\ncontract to recover for personal injuries, and replevin\n\nactions” and provides:\n\n          Except as otherwise provided, actions of\n          tort, actions of contract to recover for\n          personal   injuries,   and  actions   of\n          replevin, shall be commenced only within\n          three years next after the cause of\n          action accrues.\n\n          Although we have not previously addressed the issue\n\nof the applicable statute of limitations in the context of\n\na section 510 claim, several other circuits have, and they\n\nhave determined that section 510 claims for benefits are\n\nmost analogous to state law actions for wrongful termination\n\nor   retaliatory   discharge.     See   Sandberg   v.   KPMG   Peat\n\nMarwick, 111 F.3d 331, 334-35 (2nd Cir. 1997); McClure v.\n\nZoecon, Inc., 936 F.2d 777, 778-79 (5th Cir. 1991); Taylor v.\n\nGoodyear Tire and Rubber Co., 38 F.3d 1216, 1994 WL 573913\n\nat *1 (6th Cir. 1994) (unpublished);         Teumer v.    General\n\nMotors Corp., 34 F.3d 542, 549-50 (7th Cir. 1994); Burrey v.\n\nPacific Gas & Elec. Co., 159 F.3d 388, 397 (9th Cir. 1998);\n\nHeld v. Manufacturers Hanover Leasing Corp., 912 F.2d 1197,\n\n1205 (10th Cir. 1990); Musick v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.,\n\nInc., 81 F.3d 136, 137-39 (11th Cir. 1996).        We agree with\n\n                                -3-\n\fthese courts’ characterization of the section 510 claim for\n\nbenefits.       We specifically agree with the district court’s\n\ndetermination that Muldoon’s section 510 claim for benefits\n\nbased upon his allegation of wrongful termination is most\n\nanalogous to M.G.L.A. c. 260, § 2A.                 Because Muldoon’s cause\n\nof action accrued in April 1993, the date on which he\n\nalleges he was wrongfully terminated, and he did not file\n\nhis section 510 action in the district court until March\n\n1999, his action was time-barred pursuant to M.G.L.A. c.\n\n260, § 2A.       The district court did not err in dismissing\n\nMuldoon’s complaint on this basis.\n\n            In an effort to characterize his claim as sounding\n\nin   general     contract       (and    not    to    recover       for    personal\n\ninjury),    Muldoon      additionally          asserts      that    his    amended\n\ncomplaint alleged a violation of section 301 of the Labor\n\nManagement Relations Act (LMRA), 29 U.S.C. § 185, as well as\n\na    section    510    claim,     and    that       the     LMRA    may    not    be\n\n“preempted” by ERISA § 510.                   This argument lacks merit.\n\nAlthough       the    amended    complaint          makes    reference       to    a\n\ncollective bargaining agreement in its factual allegations,\n\nit contains no support for Muldoon’s contention that he has\n\nasserted a breach of the collective bargaining agreement in\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fsupport of a section 301 claim.   In this context, Muldoon’s\n\nlegal argument that ERISA may not preempt the LMRA is a non-\n\nissue.\n\n         Finally, Muldoon’s assertion that the district\n\ncourt abused its discretion by denying his request for oral\n\nargument on his claim also is unavailing.    Because he had\n\nadequate opportunity to provide the district court with\n\nevidence supporting his position, and he did so, Muldoon has\n\nmade no showing of prejudice.     See Bratt v. International\n\nBusiness Machines Corp., 785 F.2d 352, 363 (1st Cir. 1986).\n\n          The district court’s judgment is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                            -5-\n\f",
