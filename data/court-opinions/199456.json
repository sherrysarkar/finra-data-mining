KELLY,\n\n                       Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                 v.\n\n                    TOWN OF CHELMSFORD, ET AL.,\n\n                       Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n              [Hon. Rya W. Zobel, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                     Selya, Circuit Judge,\n          Campbell and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Danny M. Kelly on brief pro se.\n     Leonard H. Kesten, Deidre Brennan Regan and Brody, Hardoon,\nPerkins & Kesten on brief for appellee Town of Chelmsford.\n\n\n\n\n                           June 14, 2001\n\f         Per    Curiam.     After   affording   plaintiff     an\n\nopportunity to file an amended complaint which \"clearly and\n\nconcisely\" set forth his claims, and after two hearings on\n\nthe matter, the district court granted defendants' motions\n\nto dismiss.   Reviewing the dismissal de novo in light of the\n\nbriefs and the record, we see no error.         The complaint\n\nfailed to understandably state a cognizable claim for relief\n\nand some of the relief demanded was not within the court's\n\njurisdiction.     Plaintiff's   memorandum   response   to   the\n\ncourt's order to clarify suggested that plaintiff was unable\n\nor unwilling to cure the deficiencies.\n\n         Affirmed.\n\f",
