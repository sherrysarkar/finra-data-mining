He alleges  that the\r\n\nUnion discriminated against  him on the basis of  his age when it\r\n\nadopted  a new  salary structure  for his  office of  Local Union\r\n\nPresident, effectively eliminating his  salary.  Bramble  brought\r\n\nthis suit under both a disparate treatment and a disparate impact\r\n\ntheory of  recovery.   The district court  dismissed the  case on\r\n\nsummary judgment  and  this  appeal  followed.   See  Bramble  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nAmerican  Postal Workers Union, AFL-CIO,  963 F. Supp. 90 (D.R.I.\r                                                 \r\n\n1997).  We affirm.\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r                                                \r\n\n          The   following  facts   are  essentially   undisputed.\r\n\nBramble,  a  United  States  Postal  Service  (\"Postal  Service\")\r\n\nworker, was first  elected to the Union presidency  in 1974.  For\r\n\neleven years thereafter, he held the post while working full-time\r\n\nat the  postal service.   In 1985,  the Union  voted to  make the\r\n\npresidency a full-time position.  The Union paid Bramble a $3,000\r\n\nstipend plus the equivalent  of his old salary.  In  spite of the\r\n\nfact  that he  was  no longer  drawing a  salary from  the Postal\r\n\nService,  Bramble maintained  his  status  as  an  active  Postal\r\n\nService employee as he continued to hold the presidency.\r\n\n          In November 1991,  Bramble was re-elected as  the Union\r\n\npresident in a  close three-way race in which he garnered only 35\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\npercent of the vote.  The year following his re-election, Bramble\r\n\naccepted an early retirement package from the Postal Service.  At\r\n\nthat  point, Bramble began drawing  a federal pension in addition\r\n\nto his full salary as Union president.\r\n\n          In  January  1993,  with  the  majority  of  the  Union\r\n\nopposing  Bramble's administration,  an  amendment to  the  Union\r\n\nconstitution  was adopted  by a  vote  of 34-23.   The  amendment\r\n\nrevised the salary structure of the Union presidency from a fixed\r\n\nrate to a  rate that  was tied  to the president's  salary as  an\r\n\nactive Postal  Service employee.   According to this  \"active pay\r\n\nstatus\" rate,  any Union president  receives a $3,000  stipend in\r\n\naddition to the salary he or she would receive in accordance with\r\n\nhis or her active status with the Postal Service.1\r\n\n          Pursuant to  the new  policy,  more experienced  postal\r\n\nworkers  serving as president  receive higher salaries  than less\r\n\nexperienced workers  holding the same position,  while presidents\r\n\nwho are retired or on disability receive a mere $3,000 in  annual\r\n\ncompensation.   Because  Bramble was retired,  the salary  he was\r\n\nreceiving in addition to the stipend was eliminated.   It is also\r\n\nundisputed that  Bramble was disliked  by many in the  union, and\r\n\nthat  the amendment  was intended  by many,  if not  all, of  its\r\n\nsupporters as a means to force Bramble's resignation.  On July 1,\r\n\n1993, Bramble did just that.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  The original amendment  to the Union constitution was somewhat\r\nconfusing,  but a subsequent amendment was adopted to clarify the\r\n\"active pay status\" policy.  The district court opinion refers to\r\nthis  \"active  pay status\"  policy  as  the  \"no loss,  no  gain\"\r\namendment.  See Bramble, 963 F. Supp. at 93.\r                                 \r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n          Two  weeks  later,  Bramble brought  this  suit  in the\r\n\nFederal District Court of Rhode Island alleging that  the Union's\r\n\nactions  amounted  to  a constructive  discharge  based  upon age\r\n\ndiscrimination  in  violation  of  the  ADEA,  29 U.S.C.     626.\r\n\nBramble sued the Union in both its  capacity as an \"employer\" and\r\n\nas a \"labor  union\" under the ADEA.   Bramble's amended complaint\r\n\nemployed both disparate  treatment and disparate  impact theories\r\n\nof recovery.   In his disparate treatment  claim, Bramble alleges\r\n\nthat the  defendant used his eligibility for  retirement, a proxy\r\n\nfor  his  age, as  a  means to  force him  from  office.   In his\r\n\ndisparate  impact  claim,  Bramble alleges  that  the  new salary\r\n\nstructure is  a  policy which  disproportionately affects  people\r\n\nprotected by the ADEA.  The district court dismissed this case on\r\n\nsummary judgment, concluding that there was insufficient evidence\r\n\nto create a genuine dispute as to whether the Union was motivated\r\n\nby age-based  animus and  that business  necessity justified  the\r\n\nUnion's new policy.\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\nI.  Jurisdiction\r          I.  Jurisdiction\r\n\n          As a  preliminary matter,  the Union  claims that  this\r\n\ncourt does not have jurisdiction over this case because the Union\r\n\nis  not covered  as  an \"employer\"  under the  ADEA, 29  U.S.C.  \r\n\n623(a).  An  employer is only subject  to the ADEA if  it employs\r\n\n\"twenty or more employees for each  working day in each of twenty\r\n\nor more  calendar  weeks in  the  current or  preceding  calendar\r\n\nyear.\"  29  U.S.C.   630(b).  The  Union claims that  Bramble was\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nits only  true employee and that it is  thus outside the scope of\r\n\nthe ADEA.   This argument is  bolstered by an examination  of the\r\n\nUnion's W-3  forms, which  reveal that,  while over thirty  union\r\n\n\"employees\" received some  form of compensation during  the years\r\n\nat issue, almost all of  these \"employees\" received less than one\r\n\nthousand  dollars per  year.    While this  fact  casts doubt  on\r\n\nwhether twenty or  more employees were actually engaged  in Union\r\n\nwork for each working day  in twenty or more calendar weeks,  the\r\n\nrecord at this stage  of the case does not  contain any schedules\r\n\nor time  sheets to indicate when  employees were at the  Union or\r\n\nengaged in Union  duties.  Construing this limited  record in the\r\n\nlight most favorable to Bramble, we must conclude that there is a\r\n\ngenuine issue of material fact regarding the qualification of the\r\n\nUnion as an \"employer\" under sections 623(a) and 630.  Therefore,\r\n\nit is premature for this court to declare that the district court\r\n\nacted  without   proper  subject  matter  jurisdiction   when  it\r\n\nconsidered the merits of this case for summary judgment purposes.\r\n\n          Furthermore,  \"'[i]t is a  familiar tenet that  when an\r\n\nappeal presents a  jurisdictional quandry, yet the  merits of the\r\n\nunderlying issue,  if reached, will  in any event be  resolved in\r\n\nfavor of the party challenging the court's jurisdiction, then the\r\n\ncourt may forsake the jurisdictional riddle and simply dispose of\r\n\nthe appeal on  the merits.'\"  See  Rojas v. Fitch, 127  F.3d 184,\r                                                           \r\n\n187 (1st Cir. 1997) (quoting Hachikian  v. FDIC, 96 F.3d 502, 506\r                                                         \r\n\nn.4 (1st Cir. 1996)).  In light of the fact that summary judgment\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nfor the Union is affirmed  herein, we are not inclined  to remand\r\n\non jurisdictional grounds.\r\n\n          The Union  also  argues  that it  is  not  required  to\r\n\nconform  to  ADEA  requirements  because  it  is   not  a  \"labor\r\n\norganization\" covered  by section   623(c).  A labor organization\r\n\nunder the ADEA represents employees of  a covered \"employer,\" and\r\n\nany  corporation  wholly  owned  by  the  federal  government  is\r\n\nspecifically excluded from the  ADEA's definition of  \"employer.\"\r\n\nSee 29 U.S.C.   630(b).  However,  if the Union is subject to the\r             \r\n\nrequirements of the ADEA by virtue of its status as an \"employer\"\r                                                   \r\n\nunder section  623(a) and is  being sued in that  capacity, it is\r\n\nirrelevant  whether it also  qualifies as a  \"labor organization\"\r\n\nunder  section 623(c).   Thus, the Union's  second jurisdictional\r\n\nargument has been mooted by  our finding that summary judgment on\r\n\nthe issue of subject matter jurisdiction would be premature.\r\n\nII.  Disparate Treatment\r          II.  Disparate Treatment\r\n\n          Review  of a district court's award of summary judgment\r\n\nis de novo.   See United Nat'l  Ins. Co. v. Penuche's,  Inc., 128\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.3d 28,  30 (1st Cir. 1997).   We view the entire  record in the\r\n\nlight most  hospitable to  the party  opposing summary  judgment,\r\n\nindulging  all reasonable inferences in  that party's favor.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nAhern v. O'Donnell, 109 F.3d 809, 811 (1st Cir. 1997).\r                            \r\n\n          The ADEA was promulgated  by Congress out of a  concern\r\n\nthat   older   workers   were  being   deprived   of   employment\r\n\nopportunities  due  to  inaccurate  stereotypes.    See  EEOC  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nWyoming,  460 U.S.  226, 231  (1983).   To establish  a disparate\r                 \r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\ntreatment claim under the ADEA, an employee must show that he was\r\n\ntreated adversely because  of his age.  Mesnick  v. General Elec.\r                                                                           \r\n\nCo., 950 F.2d  816, 823 (1st  Cir. 1991), cert. denied,  504 U.S.\r                                                                \r\n\n985 (1992).  To survive summary judgment, the employee must first\r\n\neither present  direct evidence of  discrimination or make  out a\r\n\nprima facie case of discrimination, invoking the  burden-shifting\r\n\nframework of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-\r                                                       \r\n\n05 (1973).  See Mesnick,  950 F.2d at 823.   In this case,  there\r                                 \r\n\nwas  no direct evidence  of discrimination.2   Therefore, Bramble\r\n\nwas required  to make out  a prima facie case  demonstrating that\r\n\n(1) he was over the age of forty; (2) his work was sufficient  to\r\n\nmeet his  employer's  legitimate expectations;  (3) his  employer\r\n\ntook adverse  action against him;  and (4) the employer  sought a\r\n\nreplacement with  roughly  equivalent  job  qualifications,  thus\r\n\nrevealing a continued need for the same services and skills.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nid. (citing Hebert v. Mohawk Rubber Co., 872 F.2d 1104, 1110 (1st\r                                                 \r\n\nCir. 1989)).\r\n\n          Bramble's   claim   was   different   from   most   age\r\n\ndiscrimination claims insofar  as he held an elected  office.  He\r                                                              \r\n\nwas  employed collectively by the union  members.  This obviously\r\n\ncomplicated  Bramble's task  of showing discriminatory  animus on\r\n\nthe  part  of  his  employer.    The decision  to  constructively\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  Bramble argues that some direct evidence of discrimination did\r\nexist in  this case.   He  points to  a comment  made by a  union\r\nmember on  the floor  prior  to the  vote on  the amended  salary\r\nstructure,  referring to  Bramble  as  \"the  retired  President.\"\r\nHowever,  this  comment  plainly  provides  no  evidence  of  age\r\ndiscrimination.\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\ndischarge Bramble was made by a majority of the 57 members of the\r\n\nunion electorate who  voted on the amendment, and,  as courts are\r\n\nacutely aware, determining  the \"motive\" behind a  policy adopted\r\n\nvia popular vote is a monumental challenge.  See e.g., O'Brien v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nUnited States,  391 U.S.  367, 383-84  (1968) (\"[i]nquiries  into\r                       \r\n\ncongressional motives or purposes are a  hazardous matter\").  For\r\n\nexample,  the requirement that  Bramble's work be  \"sufficient to\r\n\nmeet his employer's legitimate expectations\" effectively became a\r\n\nrequirement that Bramble  be a successful  politician.  Here  was\r\n\nwhere  Bramble's improbable effort to prove age discrimination on\r\n\nthe part of an entire union electorate ultimately failed.\r\n\n          Dale Bramble  eventually  lost favor  with  his  Postal\r\n\nWorker constituents.  Bramble's counsel  may have stated it  most\r\n\nsuccinctly when he stated that \"there were a lot of people in the\r\n\nUnion who did not  like him.\"  After nineteen years  as the Union\r\n\nPresident,  Bramble's  counsel  explained,  he  had  made  enough\r\n\nenemies that \"[the Union]  wanted to get  rid of him for  several\r\n\nreasons.\"   For over a  year, Bramble had continued  as President\r\n\nafter failing to win a majority in the presidential election, and\r\n\nthere is  no evidence  that his popularity  was increasing.   The\r\n\ntranscript of  the  Union  meeting at  which  the  amendment  was\r\n\nadopted reveals that Bramble was perceived by  various members of\r\n\nthe  Union  as  being  insulated,  greedy,  uncommunicative,  and\r\n\ngenerally untrustworthy.   It  is not  for this  or any  court to\r\n\ndetermine the character of the plaintiff in this case, but  it is\r\n\nrelevant that the Union members were critical of their President.\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nNone of the members who spoke out against Bramble on that evening\r\n\ncriticized him as being too old for his job.  In the face of this\r\n\nevidence  that the majority of  the union members were displeased\r\n\nwith Bramble's presidency, and due to the lack of any evidence to\r\n\nthe  contrary, we reject Bramble's claims of disparate treatment.\r\n\nIn  essence, he failed  to establish a  key element of  his prima\r\n\nfacie   case  of  disparate  treatment  --  that  \"his  work  was\r\n\nsufficient to meet his employer's legitimate expectations.\"3\r\n\n          Bramble argues that  even if the  Union wanted to  oust\r\n\nhim as president for reasons other than age, it violated the ADEA\r\n\nwhen it implemented its new \"active pay status\" salary  plan.  He\r\n\nalleges that the plan \"constitutes a form of overt discriminatory\r\n\nanimus\" because retirement status is  tied to age.   Essentially,\r\n\nBramble argues  that because  older people  are  the only  people\r\n\neligible for  retirement, and  because the  new salary  structure\r\n\nwould have the primary effect of discouraging retired people from\r\n\nseeking the Union presidency, the  new salary structure is per se\r\n\nage discrimination.   However,  Bramble's argument  fundamentally\r\n\nmisinterprets Hazen  Paper v. Biggens,  507 U.S. 604  (1993), the\r                                               \r\n\nmost recent Supreme Court case on this issue.\r\n\n          In  Hazen  Paper,  the  Court  considered  \"whether  an\r                                    \r\n\nemployer violates  the ADEA by  acting on the basis  of a factor,\r\n\nsuch  as  an  employee's pension  status  or  seniority,  that is\r\n\nempirically correlated  with age.\"  Id.  at 608.  In  holding for\r                                                 \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3   The Union has  since amended its  constitution to provide for\r\nrun-off elections so that no President will ever again be elected\r\nwithout winning a majority vote.\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nthe employer  in that case, the Court clarified that \"there is no\r\n\ndisparate treatment under the ADEA when the factor motivating the\r\n\nemployer is some feature other than the employee's age.\"   Id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n609.  The reasoning behind the Court's decision was that \"age and\r\n\nyears of  service are analytically distinct, an employer can take\r\n\naccount of one while ignoring the other, and thus it is incorrect\r\n\nto  say that a decision based on  years of service is necessarily\r\n\n'age based.'\"  Id. at 611.\r                            \r\n\n          Despite  Bramble's  attempts   to  distinguish  pension\r\n\nstatus from \"active pay status,\" the analysis under the ADEA must\r\n\nbe the same.  While retired postal workers likely outnumber those\r\n\npostal workers on  disability or unpaid  leave, the fact  remains\r\n\nthat the  group  negatively affected  by  the active  pay  status\r\n\npolicy  is \"analytically distinct\"  from the group  of retirement\r\n\naged  postal employees.   In  other  words, there  is a  positive\r\n\ncorrelation between active pay status and age,  but one is not an\r\n\nexact proxy for the other.\r\n\n          Hazen Paper explains that where  an employment decision\r                               \r\n\nis premised  upon  an age-correlated  but  analytically  distinct\r\n\nfactor, a  violation of the  ADEA has occurred  only if there  is\r\n\nadditional evidence that  the employer was  motivated by an  age-\r\n\ndiscriminatory animus.  Id. at 612-13.  As discussed above, there\r                                     \r\n\nis  no such  evidence in  this case.   The  plaintiff's disparate\r\n\ntreatment claim must fail.\r\n\nIII.  Disparate Impact\r          III.  Disparate Impact\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\n          Bramble  also   claims  that  the  Union's  new  salary\r\n\nstructure has a \"disparate impact\" on older persons  in violation\r\n\nof the ADEA.   A \"disparate  impact\" claim involves  \"'employment\r\n\npractices that are facially neutral in the treatment of different\r\n\ngroups  but  that in  fact fall  more harshly  on one  group than\r\n\nanother and cannot be justified by a business necessity.'\"  Hazen\r                                                                           \r\n\nPaper, 507 U.S.  at 609, quoting Teamsters v.  United States, 431\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S.  324, 335-36,  n.15 (1977).    Statistics comparing  persons\r\n\nholding at-issue jobs and composition of qualified job applicants\r\n\nare commonly a basic component of  a disparate impact claim.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nWards  Cove Packing  Co., Inc.  v.

As the Supreme  Court has repeatedly reminded, there has\r\n\nbeen  no  definitive  interpretation  of  the  applicability   of\r\n\ndisparate impact analysis to the ADEA.  See Hazen Paper, 507 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\nat 610;  Markham v. Geller,  451 U.S. 945 (1981)  (Rehnquist, J.,\r                                    \r\n\ndissenting from denial  of certiorari).  Furthermore,  this Court\r\n\nhas never  addressed the question.   However, this case  does not\r\n\npresent  this  Court  with  a  proper occasion  to  take  up  the\r\n\nquestion, because, even  assuming arguendo that these  claims are\r                                                    \r\n\nviable under  the ADEA, it  is plainly apparent that  Bramble has\r\n\ninsufficient evidence to support his claim.\r\n\n          In this case,  the effect of the  questioned employment\r\n\npractice has  not fallen on  a group at  all, but on  one person.\r\n\nOnly the president's salary was  modified by the amendment.  Thus\r\n\nit is undisputed that the only person affected by the  active pay\r\n\nstatus policy  was Bramble.   Where an employer targets  a single\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nemployee and  implements a  policy which  has, to  date, affected\r\n\nonly that one employee, there is  simply no basis for a disparate\r\n\nimpact claim.\r\n\n          Instead, it appears  that Bramble's  claim is  actually\r\n\nprospective, i.e.,  he argues that  it is apparent \"on  its face\"\r\n\nthat  the  active  pay  status  policy will  have  a  foreseeable\r                                                           \r\n\ndisparate impact.   However, proper disparate impact  claims only\r\n\ninvolve facially neutral policies.   See Hazen Paper, 507 U.S. at\r                                                              \r\n\n609.   Therefore, Bramble's disparate impact claim actually folds\r\n\ninto his failed disparate treatment claim.   See supra.  Thus, we\r                                                                \r\n\nneed  not  address  whether  the  Union  had  shown  a  \"business\r\n\nnecessity\"  for its  new policy,  the issue  which  persuaded the\r\n\ndistrict court to grant summary judgment on this disparate impact\r\n\nclaim.  See Bramble, 963 F. Supp. at 98-102. \r                             \r\n\nIV.  Reasonable Notice\r          IV.  Reasonable Notice\r\n\n          Bramble  argues  that  the district  court's  award  of\r\n\nsummary judgment failed to meet  the requirements of Fed. R. Civ.\r\n\nP.  56(c) entitling  the party opposing  summary judgment  to ten\r\n\ndays notice and an opportunity to respond.  See Stella v. Town of\r                                                                           \r\n\nTewksbury, 4  F.3d 53, 56  (1st Cir. 1993).   He argues  that the\r                   \r\n\ndistrict court awarded  summary judgment on two grounds that were\r\n\nnot discussed  in  the Union's  Motion  for Summary  Judgment  --\r\n\nnamely  that there  was no  evidence of discriminatory  animus as\r\n\nrequired  by Hazen  Paper and  that the  Union had  established a\r                                   \r\n\nbusiness  necessity  for  its  new  salary  structure.    Bramble\r\n\ncontends  that  the   ruling  thus  conflicted  with   the  well-\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nestablished principle that a trial court must give notice to both\r\n\nparties of any issues it will be considering for summary judgment\r\n\nthat  exist outside of the  original Motion for Summary Judgment.\r\n\nSee Stella, 4 F.3d at 56.\r                    \r\n\n          \"'The purpose of  Rule 56 (c)  is to  allow a party  to\r\n\nhave a  meaningful opportunity  to challenge  a summary  judgment\r\n\nmotion.'\"   Delgado-Biaggi v.  Air Transport Local  501, 112 F.3d\r                                                                 \r\n\n565, 567 (1st Cir. 1997)  (quoting C a. Petrolera Caribe, Inc. v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nArco  Caribbean,  Inc.,  754  F.2d  404,  409  (1st  Cir. 1985)).\r                                \r\n\nIndeed, where  a party  did not have  an adequate  opportunity to\r\n\naddress the rationale behind the summary judgment in the district\r\n\ncourt, we  will not address the substance of the claims on appeal\r\n\nbecause \"'leapfrogging to the merits would display  much the same\r\n\ndisregard for  established  protocol  that  marred  the  district\r\n\ncourt's  performance.'\"  Delgado-Biaggi, 112 F.3d at 568 (quoting\r                                                 \r\n\nStella, 4 F.3d  at 55).  However,  while a party must  receive an\r                \r\n\nadequate  opportunity to  challenge  the  general  grounds  of  a\r\n\nprospective award of  summary judgment, a party need  not have an\r\n\nopportunity to  address every step  of the reasoning  employed or\r\n\nevery  case relied  upon by  the district court.   In  this case,\r\n\nBramble filed two  briefs over the course of two  months in which\r\n\nhe attempted  to distinguish Hazen  Paper, the case on  which the\r                                                   \r\n\ndistrict  court  and  this court  ultimately  rely  in dismissing\r\n\nBramble's  disparate treatment claim.  Since his disparate impact\r\n\nclaim  merely extends from this failed disparate treatment claim,\r\n\nBramble's  inability to successfully  distinguish Hazen Paper was\r                                                                       \r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nfatal to  both claims.  Thus we reject Bramble's argument that he\r\n\nwas denied reasonable notice.\r\n\n          For  the reasons  stated herein,  the district  court's\r\n\naward of summary judgment is affirmed.\r                                               \r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n",

We affirm.\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r                                                \r\n\n          The   following  facts   are  essentially   undisputed.\r\n\nBramble,  a  United  States  Postal  Service  (\"Postal  Service\")\r\n\nworker, was first  elected to the Union presidency  in 1974.  For\r\n\neleven years thereafter, he held the post while working full-time\r\n\nat the  postal service.   In 1985,  the Union  voted to  make the\r\n\npresidency a full-time position.  The Union paid Bramble a $3,000\r\n\nstipend plus the equivalent  of his old salary.  In  spite of the\r\n\nfact  that he  was  no longer  drawing a  salary from  the Postal\r\n\nService,  Bramble maintained  his  status  as  an  active  Postal\r\n\nService employee as he continued to hold the presidency.\r\n\n          In November 1991,  Bramble was re-elected as  the Union\r\n\npresident in a  close three-way race in which he garnered only 35\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\npercent of the vote.  The year following his re-election, Bramble\r\n\naccepted an early retirement package from the Postal Service.  At\r\n\nthat  point, Bramble began drawing  a federal pension in addition\r\n\nto his full salary as Union president.\r\n\n          In  January  1993,  with  the  majority  of  the  Union\r\n\nopposing  Bramble's administration,  an  amendment to  the  Union\r\n\nconstitution  was adopted  by a  vote  of 34-23.   The  amendment\r\n\nrevised the salary structure of the Union presidency from a fixed\r\n\nrate to a  rate that  was tied  to the president's  salary as  an\r\n\nactive Postal  Service employee.   According to this  \"active pay\r\n\nstatus\" rate,  any Union president  receives a $3,000  stipend in\r\n\naddition to the salary he or she would receive in accordance with\r\n\nhis or her active status with the Postal Service.1\r\n\n          Pursuant to  the new  policy,  more experienced  postal\r\n\nworkers  serving as president  receive higher salaries  than less\r\n\nexperienced workers  holding the same position,  while presidents\r\n\nwho are retired or on disability receive a mere $3,000 in  annual\r\n\ncompensation.   Because  Bramble was retired,  the salary  he was\r\n\nreceiving in addition to the stipend was eliminated.   It is also\r\n\nundisputed that  Bramble was disliked  by many in the  union, and\r\n\nthat  the amendment  was intended  by many,  if not  all, of  its\r\n\nsupporters as a means to force Bramble's resignation.  On July 1,\r\n\n1993, Bramble did just that.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  The original amendment  to the Union constitution was somewhat\r\nconfusing,  but a subsequent amendment was adopted to clarify the\r\n\"active pay status\" policy.  The district court opinion refers to\r\nthis  \"active  pay status\"  policy  as  the  \"no loss,  no  gain\"\r\namendment.  See Bramble, 963 F. Supp. at 93.\r                                 \r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n          Two  weeks  later,  Bramble brought  this  suit  in the\r\n\nFederal District Court of Rhode Island alleging that  the Union's\r\n\nactions  amounted  to  a constructive  discharge  based  upon age\r\n\ndiscrimination  in  violation  of  the  ADEA,  29 U.S.C.     626.\r\n\nBramble sued the Union in both its  capacity as an \"employer\" and\r\n\nas a \"labor  union\" under the ADEA.   Bramble's amended complaint\r\n\nemployed both disparate  treatment and disparate  impact theories\r\n\nof recovery.   In his disparate treatment  claim, Bramble alleges\r\n\nthat the  defendant used his eligibility for  retirement, a proxy\r\n\nfor  his  age, as  a  means to  force him  from  office.   In his\r\n\ndisparate  impact  claim,  Bramble alleges  that  the  new salary\r\n\nstructure is  a  policy which  disproportionately affects  people\r\n\nprotected by the ADEA.  The district court dismissed this case on\r\n\nsummary judgment, concluding that there was insufficient evidence\r\n\nto create a genuine dispute as to whether the Union was motivated\r\n\nby age-based  animus and  that business  necessity justified  the\r\n\nUnion's new policy.\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\nI.  Jurisdiction\r          I.  Jurisdiction\r\n\n          As a  preliminary matter,  the Union  claims that  this\r\n\ncourt does not have jurisdiction over this case because the Union\r\n\nis  not covered  as  an \"employer\"  under the  ADEA, 29  U.S.C.  \r\n\n623(a).  An  employer is only subject  to the ADEA if  it employs\r\n\n\"twenty or more employees for each  working day in each of twenty\r\n\nor more  calendar  weeks in  the  current or  preceding  calendar\r\n\nyear.\"  29  U.S.C.   630(b).  The  Union claims that  Bramble was\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nits only  true employee and that it is  thus outside the scope of\r\n\nthe ADEA.   This argument is  bolstered by an examination  of the\r\n\nUnion's W-3  forms, which  reveal that,  while over thirty  union\r\n\n\"employees\" received some  form of compensation during  the years\r\n\nat issue, almost all of  these \"employees\" received less than one\r\n\nthousand  dollars per  year.    While this  fact  casts doubt  on\r\n\nwhether twenty or  more employees were actually engaged  in Union\r\n\nwork for each working day  in twenty or more calendar weeks,  the\r\n\nrecord at this stage  of the case does not  contain any schedules\r\n\nor time  sheets to indicate when  employees were at the  Union or\r\n\nengaged in Union  duties.  Construing this limited  record in the\r\n\nlight most favorable to Bramble, we must conclude that there is a\r\n\ngenuine issue of material fact regarding the qualification of the\r\n\nUnion as an \"employer\" under sections 623(a) and 630.  Therefore,\r\n\nit is premature for this court to declare that the district court\r\n\nacted  without   proper  subject  matter  jurisdiction   when  it\r\n\nconsidered the merits of this case for summary judgment purposes.\r\n\n          Furthermore,  \"'[i]t is a  familiar tenet that  when an\r\n\nappeal presents a  jurisdictional quandry, yet the  merits of the\r\n\nunderlying issue,  if reached, will  in any event be  resolved in\r\n\nfavor of the party challenging the court's jurisdiction, then the\r\n\ncourt may forsake the jurisdictional riddle and simply dispose of\r\n\nthe appeal on  the merits.'\"  See  Rojas v.

A labor organization\r\n\nunder the ADEA represents employees of  a covered \"employer,\" and\r\n\nany  corporation  wholly  owned  by  the  federal  government  is\r\n\nspecifically excluded from the  ADEA's definition of  \"employer.\"\r\n\nSee 29 U.S.C.   630(b).  However,  if the Union is subject to the\r             \r\n\nrequirements of the ADEA by virtue of its status as an \"employer\"\r                                                   \r\n\nunder section  623(a) and is  being sued in that  capacity, it is\r\n\nirrelevant  whether it also  qualifies as a  \"labor organization\"\r\n\nunder  section 623(c).   Thus, the Union's  second jurisdictional\r\n\nargument has been mooted by  our finding that summary judgment on\r\n\nthe issue of subject matter jurisdiction would be premature.\r\n\nII.

See e.g., O'Brien v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nUnited States,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107701\"><a href=\"/opinion/107701/united-states-v-obrien/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>  <span class=\"page\">367</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 383-84  (1968) (\"[i]nquiries  into\r                       \r\n\ncongressional motives or purposes are a  hazardous matter\").  For\r\n\nexample,  the requirement that  Bramble's work be  \"sufficient to\r\n\nmeet his employer's legitimate expectations\" effectively became a\r\n\nrequirement that Bramble  be a successful  politician.  Here  was\r\n\nwhere  Bramble's improbable effort to prove age discrimination on\r\n\nthe part of an entire union electorate ultimately failed.\r\n\n          Dale Bramble  eventually  lost favor  with  his  Postal\r\n\nWorker constituents.  Bramble's counsel  may have stated it  most\r\n\nsuccinctly when he stated that \"there were a lot of people in the\r\n\nUnion who did not  like him.\"  After nineteen years  as the Union\r\n\nPresident,  Bramble's  counsel  explained,  he  had  made  enough\r\n\nenemies that \"[the Union]  wanted to get  rid of him for  several\r\n\nreasons.\"   For over a  year, Bramble had continued  as President\r\n\nafter failing to win a majority in the presidential election, and\r\n\nthere is  no evidence  that his popularity  was increasing.   The\r\n\ntranscript of  the  Union  meeting at  which  the  amendment  was\r\n\nadopted reveals that Bramble was perceived by  various members of\r\n\nthe  Union  as  being  insulated,  greedy,  uncommunicative,  and\r\n\ngenerally untrustworthy.   It  is not  for this  or any  court to\r\n\ndetermine the character of the plaintiff in this case, but  it is\r\n\nrelevant that the Union members were critical of their President.\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nNone of the members who spoke out against Bramble on that evening\r\n\ncriticized him as being too old for his job.  In the face of this\r\n\nevidence  that the majority of  the union members were displeased\r\n\nwith Bramble's presidency, and due to the lack of any evidence to\r\n\nthe  contrary, we reject Bramble's claims of disparate treatment.\r\n\nIn  essence, he failed  to establish a  key element of  his prima\r\n\nfacie   case  of  disparate  treatment  --  that  \"his  work  was\r\n\nsufficient to meet his employer's legitimate expectations.\"3\r\n\n          Bramble argues that  even if the  Union wanted to  oust\r\n\nhim as president for reasons other than age, it violated the ADEA\r\n\nwhen it implemented its new \"active pay status\" salary  plan.  He\r\n\nalleges that the plan \"constitutes a form of overt discriminatory\r\n\nanimus\" because retirement status is  tied to age.   Essentially,\r\n\nBramble argues  that because  older people  are  the only  people\r\n\neligible for  retirement, and  because the  new salary  structure\r\n\nwould have the primary effect of discouraging retired people from\r\n\nseeking the Union presidency, the  new salary structure is per se\r\n\nage discrimination.

While retired postal workers likely outnumber those\r\n\npostal workers on  disability or unpaid  leave, the fact  remains\r\n\nthat the  group  negatively affected  by  the active  pay  status\r\n\npolicy  is \"analytically distinct\"  from the group  of retirement\r\n\naged  postal employees.   In  other  words, there  is a  positive\r\n\ncorrelation between active pay status and age,  but one is not an\r\n\nexact proxy for the other.\r\n\n          Hazen Paper explains that where  an employment decision\r                               \r\n\nis premised  upon  an age-correlated  but  analytically  distinct\r\n\nfactor, a  violation of the  ADEA has occurred  only if there  is\r\n\nadditional evidence that  the employer was  motivated by an  age-\r\n\ndiscriminatory animus.

As the Supreme  Court has repeatedly reminded, there has\r\n\nbeen  no  definitive  interpretation  of  the  applicability   of\r\n\ndisparate impact analysis to the ADEA.  See Hazen Paper, 507 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\nat 610;  Markham v. Geller,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110495\"><a href=\"/opinion/110495/walter-markham-v-miriam-e-geller/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">945</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1981)  (Rehnquist, J.,\r                                    \r\n\ndissenting from denial  of certiorari).  Furthermore,  this Court\r\n\nhas never  addressed the question.   However, this case  does not\r\n\npresent  this  Court  with  a  proper occasion  to  take  up  the\r\n\nquestion, because, even  assuming arguendo that these  claims are\r                                                    \r\n\nviable under  the ADEA, it  is plainly apparent that  Bramble has\r\n\ninsufficient evidence to support his claim.\r\n\n          In this case,  the effect of the  questioned employment\r\n\npractice has  not fallen on  a group at  all, but on  one person.\r\n\nOnly the president's salary was  modified by the amendment.  Thus\r\n\nit is undisputed that the only person affected by the  active pay\r\n\nstatus policy  was Bramble.   Where an employer targets  a single\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nemployee and  implements a  policy which  has, to  date, affected\r\n\nonly that one employee, there is  simply no basis for a disparate\r\n\nimpact claim.\r\n\n          Instead, it appears  that Bramble's  claim is  actually\r\n\nprospective, i.e.,  he argues that  it is apparent \"on  its face\"\r\n\nthat  the  active  pay  status  policy will  have  a  foreseeable\r                                                           \r\n\ndisparate impact.   However, proper disparate impact  claims only\r\n\ninvolve facially neutral policies.   See Hazen Paper, 507 U.S. at\r                                                              \r\n\n609.   Therefore, Bramble's disparate impact claim actually folds\r\n\ninto his failed disparate treatment claim.   See supra.  Thus, we\r                                                                \r\n\nneed  not  address  whether  the  Union  had  shown  a  \"business\r\n\nnecessity\"  for its  new policy,  the issue  which  persuaded the\r\n\ndistrict court to grant summary judgment on this disparate impact\r\n\nclaim.  See Bramble, 963 F. Supp. at 98-102. \r                             \r\n\nIV.  Reasonable Notice\r          IV.  Reasonable Notice\r\n\n          Bramble  argues  that  the district  court's  award  of\r\n\nsummary judgment failed to meet  the requirements of Fed. R. Civ.\r\n\nP.  56(c) entitling  the party opposing  summary judgment  to ten\r\n\ndays notice and an opportunity to respond.  See Stella v. Town of\r                                                                           \r\n\nTewksbury, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194924\"><a href=\"/opinion/194924/stella-v-tewksbury-town-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 56  (1st Cir. 1993).   He argues  that the\r                   \r\n\ndistrict court awarded  summary judgment on two grounds that were\r\n\nnot discussed  in  the Union's  Motion  for Summary  Judgment  --\r\n\nnamely  that there  was no  evidence of discriminatory  animus as\r\n\nrequired  by Hazen  Paper and  that the  Union had  established a\r                                   \r\n\nbusiness  necessity  for  its  new  salary  structure.    Bramble\r\n\ncontends  that  the   ruling  thus  conflicted  with   the  well-\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nestablished principle that a trial court must give notice to both\r\n\nparties of any issues it will be considering for summary judgment\r\n\nthat  exist outside of the  original Motion for Summary Judgment.\r\n\nSee Stella, 4 F.3d at 56.\r                    \r\n\n          \"'The purpose of  Rule 56 (c)  is to  allow a party  to\r\n\nhave a  meaningful opportunity  to challenge  a summary  judgment\r\n\nmotion.'\"   Delgado-Biaggi v.

However,  while a party must  receive an\r                \r\n\nadequate  opportunity to  challenge  the  general  grounds  of  a\r\n\nprospective award of  summary judgment, a party need  not have an\r\n\nopportunity to  address every step  of the reasoning  employed or\r\n\nevery  case relied  upon by  the district court.   In  this case,\r\n\nBramble filed two  briefs over the course of two  months in which\r\n\nhe attempted  to distinguish Hazen  Paper, the case on  which the\r                                                   \r\n\ndistrict  court  and  this court  ultimately  rely  in dismissing\r\n\nBramble's  disparate treatment claim.  Since his disparate impact\r\n\nclaim  merely extends from this failed disparate treatment claim,\r\n\nBramble's  inability to successfully  distinguish Hazen Paper was\r                                                                       \r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nfatal to  both claims.  Thus we reject Bramble's argument that he\r\n\nwas denied reasonable notice.\r\n\n          For  the reasons  stated herein,  the district  court's\r\n\naward of summary judgment is affirmed.\r                                               \r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n</pre>",
