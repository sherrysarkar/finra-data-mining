In these consolidated pro se appeals,\n\nRichard Max Strahan challenges the summary dismissal of\n\nseparate lawsuits alleging violation of § 9 of the Endangered\n\nSpecies Act (\"ESA\"), 16 U.S.C. § 1538(a).           The lawsuits were\n\nbrought on behalf of listed species of whales, and in one\n\ncase, also on behalf of listed species of sea turtles.            For\n\nthe following reasons, we affirm.\n\n          Strahan v.      New England Aquarium challenges the\n\npractices of whale watch vessels operated by the New England\n\nAquarium and the Dolphin Fleet of Provincetown, Inc. Strahan\n\nv. Hurst challenges United States Coast Guard operations.\n\nIn both cases, defendants filed motions for summary judgment\n\nand   Strahan    sought   extensions    of   time   for   responding.\n\nRoughly three months after the last extension expired, and\n\nin the absence of any further filings by Strahan (must less\n\nany   document    supporting   an      opposition    to   defendants'\n\nmotions), the district court dismissed the two suits for lack\n\nof prosecution under Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b) and on the\n\nalternative ground that the motions for summary judgment were\n\nwell-founded.\n\n            A summary judgment motion cannot be granted based\n\non an adverse party's failure to respond.            See Carmona v.\n\nToledo, 215 F.3d 134 n.9 (1st Cir. 2000); Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\f56(e) (if adverse party fails to respond, \"summary judgment,\n\nif   appropriate,   shall   be    entered\")     (emphasis   added).\n\nHowever, there is some authority that, notwithstanding this\n\nrule, a case can be dismissed at the summary judgment stage\n\nunder Rule 41(b) if the court determines that the plaintiff's\n\nfailure to respond constitutes a failure to prosecute.         See,\n\ne.g., Custer v. Pan American Life Ins. Co., 12 F.3d 410, 415\n\n(4th Cir. 1993); Lediju v. New York City Dep't of Sanitation,\n\n173 F.R.D. 105, 110 (S.D.N.Y. 1997).\n\n           In the instant case, Strahan's failure to meet the\n\nextended deadlines for filing oppositions fell against a\n\nrecent background of missed deadlines and delay on his part.\n\nContrary to his suggestion, a warning is not an absolute\n\nrequirement before dismissal.          See Robson v. Hallenbeck, 81\n\nF.3d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir. 1996).      Strahan had the opportunity to\n\nexplain his defaults by way of a motion to reinstate.            He\n\nfiled such a motion but did not proffer any valid excuses.\n\n\n\n           Arguably, Strahan's conduct rose to the level of a\n\nfailure to prosecute under Rule 41(b).         However, we need not\n\ndecide whether the dismissals can be upheld on this basis\n\nalone.   The district court did not purport to dismiss the two\n\ncases solely on this ground but rather made an independent\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f determination that summary judgment was warranted.                            Upon\n\n review   of    the   record,     we,    too,    are   persuaded        that    the\n\n dismissals were otherwise justified.\n\n               Summary    judgment      was    warranted    in    New    England\n\n Aquarium based on Strahan's failure to comply with Loc. R.\n\n 56.1, which justified the court in deeming admitted the facts\n\n presented in the movants' statements of undisputed facts.\n\n See Ruiz Rivera v. Riley, 209 F.3d 24, 28 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n Strahan suggests on appeal, without record citation, that the\n\n record contains \"several scientific studies\" sufficient to\n\n create a material issue of fact.                However, the presence of\n\n Loc. R. 56.1, requiring Strahan to file a response to guide\n\n the court, removed any requirement that otherwise might exist\n\n that the district court ferret through the record before\n\n ruling on defendants' summary judgment motions.                    See Jaroma\n\n v. Massey, 873 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir. 1989).                     In any event,\n\n Strahan fails to specifically identify any of these studies\n\n or explain how they enhance his claims.1\n\n               The   dismissal    in    Hurst    was   warranted        based    on\n\n Strahan's      failure    to    comply       with   the   sixty-day      notice\n\n\n    1 We also reject Strahan's suggestion that summary judgment\nwas improper because he was provided inadequate opportunity for\ndiscovery. Strahan does not articulate what discovery he sought\nor needed, and, thus, provides no basis to question the district\ncourt's handling of discovery.\n\n                                        -5-\n\f requirement    before     filing     suit.   See   16   U.S.C.   §\n\n 1540(g)(2)(A)(i) (providing that a citizen may not bring suit\n\n under the ESA prior to sixty days after written notice of an\n\n alleged violation has been given to the Secretary and the\n\n alleged violator).      Strahan sent his notice of intent to sue\n\n on March 19, 1998, and the complaint was filed only twenty-\n\n eight days later.       This court has interpreted the sixty-day\n\n notice requirement in environmental statute citizen suits\n\n strictly.    See Water Keeper Alliance v. United States Dep't\n\n of Defense, 271 F.3d 21, 29 (1st Cir. 2001).2\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n    2We recognize that the notice mailed in Hurst purported to\nbe a \"continuation\" of notices sent between 1989 and 1992.\nHowever, in the interim, Strahan litigated Strahan v. Linnon,\n94cv11128, involving a substantially identical \"takings\" claim.\nIn 1997, Linnon was resolved in the Coast Guard's favor. See\nStrahan v. Linnon, 967 F. Supp. 581 (D. Mass. 1997). Hurst is\nbased, in part, on events that post-date Linnon. However, to\nthe extent that the second suit could go forward and is not\nprecluded by the first, new notice and a full sixty-day period\nwas required.\n\n                                    -6-\n\f",
