Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n               Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\f     John A.

Loreen David appeals a district court judgment\n\nwhich   denied   her   motion   for   relief   from   a   final   judgment\n\ncompelling the forfeiture of her tavern at 25 Pleasant Street in\n\nWebster, Massachusetts. Appellant maintains that the forfeiture\n\nwas unfair because it violated the terms of her plea agreement\n\nand because her former attorney is to blame for her failure to\n\nlitigate the matter in the district court.\n\n    This court has thoroughly reviewed the record and the\n\nparties' briefs on appeal.      We conclude that the district court\n\ndid not abuse its discretion in denying appellant relief.              See\n\nUnited States v. Parcel of Land and Residence at 18 Oakwood\n\nStreet, 958 F.2d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir. 1992);          United States v.

We decline to\n\nconsider appellant's contention that the forfeiture constituted\n\nan excessive fine in violation of the Eighth Amendment because\n\nappellant failed to raise this argument below and has presented\n\nno reason for having failed to do so. See Amcel Corp. v.\n\nInternational Exec. Sales, Inc., 170 F.3d 32, 35 (1st Cir.\n\n1999); United States v. Palmer, 956 F.2d 3, 6 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\nAccordingly, the government's motion for summary disposition is\n\ngranted. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.
