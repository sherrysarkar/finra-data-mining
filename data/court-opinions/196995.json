Grabiec, Jr., connected with an illegal gambling and loan-\r\n\nsharking  organization known  as  the Winter  Hill Gang,  was\r\n\nfound guilty  of various racketeering offenses,  18 U.S.C.   \r\n\n1962(c) and (d), but acquitted on one count under 18 U.S.C.  \r\n\n894(a).    On  this  appeal  he  complains  of a  prejudicial\r\n\nargument  by the  prosecutor in  his final  summation  to the\r\n\njury,  and of  the court's  refusal to  allow him  to  make a\r\n\nparticular  argument   based  on  the   government's  opening\r\n\nstatement.  We affirm.\r\n\n          After  defendant's  brief's  lengthy exposition  of\r\n\nvarious types of improper  arguments, their possibly  serious\r\n\nconsequences,  and  effective   and  ineffective  cures,   it\r\n\ndeveloped that the prosecutor's  offense, after defendant had\r\n\ncharged him with \"bias . . . puffery . . . bombast  and . . .\r\n\nhot air\"1 was to speak of  the defense as \"laughable.\"   More\r\n\nexactly:\r\n\n               [I]f there is  any bombast,  puffery\r\n          and hot air in this case, it's not coming\r\n          from our side of the table.  In fact, the\r\n          defense in  this case would  be laughable\r\n          if  the  crimes  involved  were   not  so\r\n          serious.\r\n\nIt further  appeared that,  upon  defendant's objection,  the\r\n\ncourt  said to the jury, \"Well, the jury will understand that\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.

It will be  taken that way.\"\r\n\nThe  defendant said nothing further.\r\n\n          This silence,  of course, means  defendant must now\r\n\nprove plain error.  United States v. Wihbey, 75 F.3d 761, 769\r                                                       \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1996) (citing United States v.

We do not,  however,\r\n\nfind even simple error.\r\n\n          We can agree with defendant that we  have long held\r\n\nthat counsel  must not express a personal opinion.  Greenberg\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. United States, 280 F.2d 472, 475 (1st Cir. 1960) (Aldrich,\r                            \r\n\nJ.).  Again,  in United States v. Nickens, 955  F.2d 112, 121\r                                                     \r\n\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 835 (1992), we said, \"This\r                                    \r\n\ncourt  has  repeatedly  stated  that  it  is  improper  for a\r\n\nprosecutor to inject personal beliefs about the evidence into\r\n\nclosing argument.\" (citations  omitted).   Although there  is\r\n\nperhaps  a heavier  burden on  prosecutors, the  rule applies\r\n\nboth  ways.   In  United  States v.  Young, 470  U.S.  1, 8-9\r                                                      \r\n\n(1985),  the   Court  said,   \"Defense   counsel,  like   the\r\n\nprosecutor, must refrain  from interjecting personal  beliefs\r\n\ninto  the presentation  of  his  case.\" (citations  omitted).\r\n\nStrict application  of this  rule in  the course  of extended\r\n\nargument, resulting in constant \"I suggest  to you that . . .\r\n\n\" \"I ask you  to find . . . \" becomes tiresome.  We have been\r\n\ncontent with the court,  in its discretion, substituting \"the\r\n\nstandard  instruction  that  arguments  of  counsel  are  not\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nevidence.\"  United  States v.  Bennett, 75 F.3d  40, 46  (1st\r                                                  \r\n\nCir.  1996), petition for  cert. filed,     U.S.L.W.

There the  prosecutor stated\r\n\nthat a defense argument was a \"diversion.\"  We were satisfied\r\n\nwith the  court's giving  that instruction.   We  are equally\r\n\nsatisfied here.\r\n\n          Bennett,  in  fact,  is  even more  helpful.    The\r                             \r\n\nprosecution  there  had  asserted  that  one  of  defendant's\r\n\narguments \"doesn't pass the laugh test.\"  We accepted that as\r\n\nwithin the ordinary \"rough and tumble,\" and not violating the\r\n\nprosecutor's duty  \"to refrain  from  impugning, directly  or\r\n\nthrough implication, the integrity  or institutional role  of\r\n\ndefense counsel.\"  Id. \r                                  \r\n\n           Even without Bennett the prosecutor's  conduct was\r                                           \r\n\nunexceptional  for  there  is   another  rule.    As  against\r\n\ndefendant's   citation  of   the  oft-quoted   adjuration  to\r\n\nprosecutors in  Berger  v. United  States,  295 U.S.  78,  88\r                                                     \r\n\n(1935),  defendant  fails to  note  the  Court's more  recent\r\n\nobservation:\r\n\n               [I]f  the prosecutor's  remarks were\r\n          \"invited,\" and did  no more than  respond\r\n          substantially  in  order  to  \"right  the\r\n          scale,\" such comments  would not  warrant\r\n          reversing a conviction.\r\n\nUnited States  v. Young, 470  U.S. at 14  (footnote omitted).\r                                   \r\n\nAfter defendant's oratorical charges, five times repeated, it\r\n\nscarcely lay in his mouth to object to a single reply in like\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\ntone.   United  States v.  Whiting, 28  F.3d 1296,  1303 (1st\r                                              \r\n\nCir.), cert. denied,      U.S.     , 115 S.

Maccini,  721 F.2d 840, 846 (1st  Cir. 1983).  Even tested\r                      \r\n\nas simple error this claim is frivolous.\r\n\n          Second, defendant maintains that the court erred in\r\n\nrestricting his closing argument, thereby ensuring conviction\r\n\non  Count 57, one of two extortion charges.  Specifically, he\r\n\ncontends  he  was  precluded from  arguing  to  the  jury the\r\n\nprosecution's failure  to introduce evidence  promised in its\r\n\nopening statement.\r\n\n          During his opening, the  prosecutor, in an  attempt\r\n\nto describe the defendant's  collection methodology, told the\r\n\njury it would hear evidence that:\r\n\n               One night [Grabiec] even barged into\r\n          Mr. Gagliardi's home in a frenzy, grabbed\r\n          his wallet, cut up Mr. Gagliardi's credit\r\n          cards  in front  of Mr.  Gagliardi's wife\r\n          and  children.   I  suggest to  you  that\r\n          there can be nothing more terrifying than\r\n          having  somebody come  into your  home in\r\n          front of your wife and children and doing\r\n          something like that.\r\n\nWhile Gagliardi  did eventually testify to  a nighttime visit\r\n\nfrom the defendant that left  him feeling \"very, very upset,\"\r\n\nhe  also  testified that  he  had never  been  threatened nor\r\n\nintimidated.    When the  government  sought  to introduce  a\r\n\nportion of a tape of monitored conversations between Grabiec,\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nGagliardi  and others  contradicting  Gagliardi's  denial  of\r\n\nintimidation,2  the  trial  judge  sustained  the defendant's\r\n\nobjection and excluded the evidence.\r\n\n          The defendant, in  his closing argument,  sought to\r\n\nseize  the moment  by  reminding the  jury,  \"In the  opening\r\n\nstatement, Mr. Wyshak said to you that  there was going to be\r\n\nevidence that in the  middle of the night Mr.  Grabiec barged\r\n\ninto the home  of Mr.  Gagliardi and was  threatening him  in\r\n\nfront--,\" at  which point the prosecutor objected.  The court\r\n\nsustained the objection and cautioned the jury that it \"heard\r\n\nwhat was said and you  will take your own memory both  of the\r\n\narguments  and  of the  evidence  rather  than what  opposing\r\n\ncounsel says the  other counsel  said.\"    Defendant did  not\r\n\nattempt to rephrase  his argument  nor did he  object to  the\r\n\nruling  or  request   a  curative  statement  regarding   the\r\n\nprosecutor's opening statement.\r\n\n          After the verdict, during a colloquy concerning the\r\n\nquestion of defendant's immediate detention under 18 U.S.C.  \r\n\n3143(a)(2), defendant  contended that  he had been  prevented\r\n\nfrom  making, what  was in  his  view, a  legitimate argument\r\n\nduring summation that was directly relevant to his conviction\r\n\non the  extortion count.  The prosecution  responded that the\r\n\nrestriction was  proper  because \"essentially  defendant  was\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  On the  tape, Gagliardi stated that  \"[Grabiec] came into\r\nmy house  and he was  fucking terrorizing me  in front of  my\r\nwife.\" \r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\ntrying  to   impugn  the  integrity  of   the  Government  by\r\n\ncommenting on the  fact that they didn't hear  evidence which\r\n\nthe defendant on its own motion  asked not to be heard by the\r\n\njury. . . .\"\r\n\n          After reviewing the transcript, the court observed:\r\n\n               [I]t  was  that  middle-of-the-night\r\n          charge   that   triggered  my   immediate\r\n          ruling: \"Objection sustained.\"   There is\r\n          a  lot of  difference  between saying  he\r\n          barged  in in  a frenzy  in front  of his\r\n          wife at night, cut  up his credit  cards,\r\n          and saying he barged  in in the middle of\r\n          the  night.   That carries  an impression\r\n          after  everybody's gone  to  bed.    It's\r\n          quite a different charge.   And if you're\r\n          going to quote the other side's argument,\r\n          you need to be accurate about it.\r\n\n          Defendant argues that his Sixth Amendment  right to\r\n\nassistance of counsel was violated by the court's restriction\r\n\nof his closing argument.   See Herring v. New York, 422  U.S.\r                                                              \r\n\n853  (1975).    Had  the  jury  been  able  to  consider  the\r\n\ngovernment's failure to produce  this evidence, he maintains,\r\n\nit  would not have convicted  on this extortion  charge as it\r\n\nhad not  convicted on  the parallel charge  involving another\r\n\nvictim.\r\n\n          The government, while  maintaining that its  reason\r\n\nfor  objecting  was   valid,  adds  that   defense  counsel's\r\n\nmischaracterization  warranted the  court's action.   Because\r\n\ndefendant  failed to object to the court's ruling and did not\r\n\nattempt  to rephrase his  argument, we again  review only for\r\n\n\"plain error,\"  requiring him to  \"show an obvious  and clear\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nerror  under  current  law  that   affected  his  substantial\r\n\nrights.\"  United  States v.

Here the court upheld the government's objection\r\n\nbecause,  in  its  opinion,  defendant  mischaracterized  the\r\n\nprosecution's  opening  statement.    There  is  a difference\r\n\nbetween \"middle of the night\" and \"one night;\" in the context\r\n\nof \"barging in,\" the former carries more of an aura of menace\r\n\nthan the  latter.

Grabiec, Jr., connected with an illegal gambling and loan-sharking organization known as the Winter Hill Gang, was found guilty of various racketeering offenses, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1962(c) and (d), but acquitted on one count under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 894(a).  On this appeal he complains of a prejudicial argument by the prosecutor in his final summation to the jury, and of the court's refusal to allow him to make a particular argument based on the government's opening statement.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After defendant's brief's lengthy exposition of various types of improper arguments, their possibly serious consequences, and effective and ineffective cures, it developed that the prosecutor's offense, after defendant had charged him with \"bias ... puffery ... bombast and ... hot air\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> was to speak of the defense as \"laughable.\"   More exactly:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]f there is any bombast, puffery and hot air in this case, it's not coming from our side of the table.  In fact, the defense in this case would be laughable if the crimes involved were not so serious.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It further appeared that, upon defendant's objection, the court said to the jury, \"Well, the jury will understand that this is argument, not evidence.  It will be taken that way.\"   The defendant said nothing further.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This silence, of course, means defendant must now prove plain error.   United States v. Wihbey, 75 F.3d 761, 769 (1st Cir.1996) (citing  United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 731, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993));  Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).  We do not, however, find even simple error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We can agree with defendant that we have long held that counsel must not express a personal opinion.   Greenberg v. United States, 280 F.2d 472, 475 (1st Cir.1960) (Aldrich, J.).  Again, in  United States v. Nickens, 955 F.2d 112, 121 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 835, 113 S.Ct. 108, 121 L.Ed.2d 66 (1992), we said, \"This court has repeatedly stated that it is improper for a prosecutor to inject personal beliefs about the evidence into closing argument.\"  (citations omitted).  Although there is perhaps a heavier burden on prosecutors, the rule applies both ways.  In  United States v. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 8-9, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 1042-43, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985), the Court said, \"Defense counsel, like the prosecutor, must refrain from interjecting personal beliefs into the presentation of his case.\"  (citations omitted).  Strict application of this rule in the course of extended argument, resulting in constant \"I suggest to you that ...\" \"I ask you to find ...\" becomes tiresome.  We have been content with the court, in its discretion, substituting \"the standard instruction that arguments of counsel are not evidence.\"   United States v. Bennett, 75 F.3d 40, 46 (1st Cir.1996), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 130, 136 L.Ed.2d 79 (1996).  There the prosecutor stated that a defense argument was a \"diversion.\"   We were satisfied with the court's giving that instruction.  We are equally satisfied here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bennett, in fact, is even more helpful.  The prosecution there had asserted that one of defendant's arguments \"doesn't pass the laugh test.\"   We accepted that as within the ordinary \"rough and tumble,\" and not violating the prosecutor's duty \"to refrain from impugning, directly or through implication, the integrity or institutional role of defense counsel.\"   Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even without  Bennett the prosecutor's conduct was unexceptional for there is another rule.  As against defendant's citation of the oft-quoted adjuration to prosecutors in  Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S.Ct. 629, 633, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935), defendant fails to note the Court's more recent observation:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]f the prosecutor's remarks were \"invited,\" and did no more than respond substantially in order to \"right the scale,\" such comments would not warrant reversing a conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Young, 470 U.S. at 14, 105 S.Ct. at 1045-46 (footnote omitted).  After defendant's oratorical charges, five times repeated, it scarcely lay in his mouth to object to a single reply in like tone.   United States v. Whiting, 28 F.3d 1296, 1303 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 378, 130 L.Ed.2d 328 (1994);   United States v. Nickens, 955 F.2d 112 at 122;   United States v. Maccini, 721 F.2d 840, 846 (1st Cir.1983).  Even tested as simple error this claim is frivolous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, defendant maintains that the court erred in restricting his closing argument, thereby ensuring conviction on Count 57, one of two extortion charges.  Specifically, he contends he was precluded from arguing to the jury the prosecution's failure to introduce evidence promised in its opening statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During his opening, the prosecutor, in an attempt to describe the defendant's collection methodology, told the jury it would hear evidence that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One night [Grabiec] even barged into Mr. Gagliardi's home in a frenzy, grabbed his wallet, cut up Mr. Gagliardi's credit cards in front of Mr. Gagliardi's wife and children.  I suggest to you that there can be nothing more terrifying than having somebody come into your home in front of your wife and children and doing something like that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Gagliardi did eventually testify to a nighttime visit from the defendant that left him feeling \"very, very upset,\" he also testified that he had never been threatened nor intimidated.  When the government sought to introduce a portion of a tape of monitored conversations between Grabiec, Gagliardi and others contradicting Gagliardi's denial of intimidation,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> the trial judge sustained the defendant's objection and excluded the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant, in his closing argument, sought to seize the moment by reminding the jury, \"In the opening statement, Mr. Wyshak said to you that there was going to be evidence that in the middle of the night Mr. Grabiec barged into the home of Mr. Gagliardi and was threatening him in front--,\" at which point the prosecutor objected.  The court sustained the objection and cautioned the jury that it \"heard what was said and you will take your own memory both of the arguments and of the evidence rather than what opposing counsel says the other counsel said.\"   Defendant did not attempt to rephrase his argument nor did he object to the ruling or request a curative statement regarding the prosecutor's opening statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the verdict, during a colloquy concerning the question of defendant's immediate detention under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3143(a)(2), defendant contended that he had been prevented from making, what was in his view, a legitimate argument during summation that was directly relevant to his conviction on the extortion count.  The prosecution responded that the restriction was proper because \"essentially defendant was trying to impugn the integrity of the Government by commenting on the fact that they didn't hear evidence which the defendant on its own motion asked not to be heard by the jury....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing the transcript, the court observed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]t was that middle-of-the-night charge that triggered my immediate ruling:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>\"Objection sustained.\"   There is a lot of difference between saying he barged in in a frenzy in front of his wife at night, cut up his credit cards, and saying he barged in in the middle of the night.  That carries an impression after everybody's gone to bed.  It's quite a different charge.  And if you're going to quote the other side's argument, you need to be accurate about it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant argues that his Sixth Amendment right to assistance of counsel was violated by the court's restriction of his closing argument.  See Herring v. New York, 422 U.S. 853, 95 S.Ct. 2550, 45 L.Ed.2d 593 (1975).  Had the jury been able to consider the government's failure to produce this evidence, he maintains, it would not have convicted on this extortion charge as it had not convicted on the parallel charge involving another victim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government, while maintaining that its reason for objecting was valid, adds that defense counsel's mischaracterization warranted the court's action.  Because defendant failed to object to the court's ruling and did not attempt to rephrase his argument, we again review only for \"plain error,\" requiring him to \"show an obvious and clear error under current law that affected his substantial rights.\"   United States v. Phaneuf, 91 F.3d 255, 263 (1st Cir.1996);   United States v. Procopio, 88 F.3d 21, 31 (1st Cir.1996);   United States v. Gilberg, 75 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir.1996) (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Sixth Amendment, a defendant is entitled to the assistance of counsel, including the delivery of a closing argument which is \"a basic element of the adversary factfinding process in a criminal trial.\"   Herring, 422 U.S. at 858, 95 S.Ct. at 2553.   The court, however, has broad discretion over the scope of summations.   Id. at 862, 95 S.Ct. at 2555;   United States v. Wood, 982 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1992);   United States v. Coast of Maine Lobster Co., 557 F.2d 905 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 862, 98 S.Ct. 191, 54 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977);   United States v. Wilbur, 545 F.2d 764, 767 (1st Cir.1976).  Here the court upheld the government's objection because, in its opinion, defendant mischaracterized the prosecution's opening statement.  There is a difference between \"middle of the night\" and \"one night;\" in the context of \"barging in,\" the former carries more of an aura of menace than the latter.  To disallow a deviation from opposing counsel's statement was well within the court's discretion.  Moreover, contemporaneous instruction to the jury to use its \"own memory\" of the arguments and evidence rather than counsels' representations, in no way constrained defendant from continuing properly with his argument, without paraphrasing opposing counsel.  We find no error plain or otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Five times</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> On the tape, Gagliardi stated that \"[Grabiec] came into my house and he was fucking terrorizing me in front of my wife.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Even tested as simple error this claim is frivolous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, defendant maintains that the court erred in restricting his closing argument, thereby ensuring conviction on Count 57, one of two extortion charges.  Specifically, he contends he was precluded from arguing to the jury the prosecution's failure to introduce evidence promised in its opening statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During his opening, the prosecutor, in an attempt to describe the defendant's collection methodology, told the jury it would hear evidence that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One night [Grabiec] even barged into Mr. Gagliardi's home in a frenzy, grabbed his wallet, cut up Mr. Gagliardi's credit cards in front of Mr. Gagliardi's wife and children.  I suggest to you that there can be nothing more terrifying than having somebody come into your home in front of your wife and children and doing something like that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Gagliardi did eventually testify to a nighttime visit from the defendant that left him feeling \"very, very upset,\" he also testified that he had never been threatened nor intimidated.  When the government sought to introduce a portion of a tape of monitored conversations between Grabiec, Gagliardi and others contradicting Gagliardi's denial of intimidation,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> the trial judge sustained the defendant's objection and excluded the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant, in his closing argument, sought to seize the moment by reminding the jury, \"In the opening statement, Mr. Wyshak said to you that there was going to be evidence that in the middle of the night Mr. Grabiec barged into the home of Mr. Gagliardi and was threatening him in front--,\" at which point the prosecutor objected.  The court sustained the objection and cautioned the jury that it \"heard what was said and you will take your own memory both of the arguments and of the evidence rather than what opposing counsel says the other counsel said.\"   Defendant did not attempt to rephrase his argument nor did he object to the ruling or request a curative statement regarding the prosecutor's opening statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the verdict, during a colloquy concerning the question of defendant's immediate detention under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3143(a)(2), defendant contended that he had been prevented from making, what was in his view, a legitimate argument during summation that was directly relevant to his conviction on the extortion count.  The prosecution responded that the restriction was proper because \"essentially defendant was trying to impugn the integrity of the Government by commenting on the fact that they didn't hear evidence which the defendant on its own motion asked not to be heard by the jury....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing the transcript, the court observed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]t was that middle-of-the-night charge that triggered my immediate ruling:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>\"Objection sustained.\"   There is a lot of difference between saying he barged in in a frenzy in front of his wife at night, cut up his credit cards, and saying he barged in in the middle of the night.  That carries an impression after everybody's gone to bed.  It's quite a different charge.  And if you're going to quote the other side's argument, you need to be accurate about it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant argues that his Sixth Amendment right to assistance of counsel was violated by the court's restriction of his closing argument.  See Herring v. New York, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109310\"><a href=\"/opinion/109310/herring-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">853</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109310\"><a href=\"/opinion/109310/herring-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Had the jury been able to consider the government's failure to produce this evidence, he maintains, it would not have convicted on this extortion charge as it had not convicted on the parallel charge involving another victim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government, while maintaining that its reason for objecting was valid, adds that defense counsel's mischaracterization warranted the court's action.  Because defendant failed to object to the court's ruling and did not attempt to rephrase his argument, we again review only for \"plain error,\" requiring him to \"show an obvious and clear error under current law that affected his substantial rights.\"   United States v.

The court, however, has broad discretion over the scope of summations.   Id. at 862, 95 S.Ct. at 2555;   United States v.

Here the court upheld the government's objection because, in its opinion, defendant mischaracterized the prosecution's opening statement.  There is a difference between \"middle of the night\" and \"one night;\" in the context of \"barging in,\" the former carries more of an aura of menace than the latter.  To disallow a deviation from opposing counsel's statement was well within the court's discretion.  Moreover, contemporaneous instruction to the jury to use its \"own memory\" of the arguments and evidence rather than counsels' representations, in no way constrained defendant from continuing properly with his argument, without paraphrasing opposing counsel.
