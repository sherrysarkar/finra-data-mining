In  March  1991\r                                                      \r\n\nappellee  Brian  A.  Pettiford  (hereinafter  defendant)  was\r\n\nconvicted  of being  a  felon-in-possession of  a firearm  in\r\n\nviolation of  18 U.S.C.    922(g)(1).   Because  he had  nine\r\n\nprior state  convictions for violent felonies,  he received a\r\n\nminimum mandatory  sentence of fifteen years  pursuant to the\r\n\nArmed Career  Criminal Act  (\"ACCA\"), 18  U.S.C.   924(e)(1).\r\n\nIn 1994, all but one of the prior convictions were vacated by\r\n\nthe  Massachusetts state  courts,  and in  1995 the  district\r\n\ncourt granted  federal habeas  corpus relief under  28 U.S.C.\r\n\n  2255 in the  form of  a sentence reduction,  on the  ground\r\n\nthat  the ACCA was now  inapplicable to the  computation.  On\r\n\nthe government's appeal, we affirm.\r\n\n                        I. Background\r                                                 \r\n\n          Approximately   two   years   after   his   federal\r\n\nsentencing,  defendant  requested audiotapes  of  his earlier\r\n\nguilty pleas  and sentencings  in Boston Municipal  Court and\r\n\nDorchester District Court.   He was unsuccessful in obtaining\r\n\nuseful tapes, post, and subsequently attempted to reconstruct\r                              \r\n\nthe proceedings  through the use of  affidavits.  Ultimately,\r\n\nthe courts vacated eight of the nine convictions.  The Boston\r\n\nMunicipal Court judge, finding no record that the trial judge\r\n\nhad engaged in any colloquy with the defendant at the time of\r\n\nhis  guilty plea, vacated the convictions  on the ground that\r\n\nthe Commonwealth had  failed to carry its burden of producing\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\na  \"contemporaneous record  affirmatively [showing]  that the\r\n\ndefendant  waived his rights  voluntarily and  knowingly,\" as\r\n\nrequired  under the  federal  Constitution and  Massachusetts\r\n\nlaw.  The Dorchester District Court apparently did the  same.\r\n\nOn  the  habeas petition,  our  district  court, taking  what\r\n\nwould, initially, seem to us the equitable view,  granted the\r\n\nrelief and resentenced defendant to the term served, four and\r\n\none half years.\r\n\n          The government  appeals, and with  indignation: the\r\n\nstate action had been  a \"windfall;\" the government  had been\r\n\n\"sandbagged.\"   In  view  of  the  fact  that  the  mandatory\r\n\nenhancement  was based  entirely upon  the state's  action in\r\n\nconvicting,1  and  not simply  a  case  where enhancement  is\r\n\npermitted for  charges with no findings,  see, e.g., U.S.S.G.\r                                                               \r\n\n  4A1.3(e),  to  complain of  state windfalls  and government\r\n\nsandbagging  is strong language.   The  government criticizes\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  18 U.S.C.   924(e)(1) reads:\r\n\n               In the case of a person who violates\r\n          section  922(g)  of  this  title  and has\r\n          three previous convictions  by any  court\r\n          referred to in  section 922(g)(1) of this\r\n          title  for a violent  felony or a serious\r\n          drug  offense,  or  both,   committed  on\r\n          occasions  different  from  one  another,\r\n          such person shall be  fined not more than\r\n          $25,000  and  imprisoned  not  less  than\r\n          fifteen  years, and,  notwithstanding any\r\n          other  provision of law,  the court shall\r\n          not  suspend the sentence  of, or grant a\r\n          probationary  sentence  to,  such  person\r\n          with  respect  to  the  conviction  under\r\n          section 922(g).\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nthe  state's procedure  as  if the  vacated convictions  were\r\n\nfederal  property, and the defendant as if he were attempting\r\n\na  trespass.   We  are induced  to  start with  the  opposite\r\n\napproach.   First, however, we must consider  a Supreme Court\r\n\ncase, United States  v. Custis, 511 U.S. 485, 114 S. Ct. 1732\r                                          \r\n\n(1994), decided after the  imposition of defendant's original\r\n\nsentence  and  its affirmance  on  appeal,  United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nPettiford, 962 F.2d 74 (1st Cir. 1992).\r                     \r\n\n                 II. United States v. Custis\r                                                        \r\n\n          In May 1994, the Supreme Court  in Custis held that\r                                                               \r\n\nunder   924(e),  unless a  defendant in a  federal sentencing\r\n\nproceeding was claiming a violation  of his right to counsel,\r\n\nhe  had no right at that time  to make a collateral attack on\r\n\nprior state  convictions.  114 S.  Ct. at 1738.   Rather, the\r\n\nCourt observed at the end of the opinion,\r\n\n               We  recognize,  however, as  did the\r\n          Court of  Appeals . . .  that Custis, who\r\n          was  still \"in  custody\" for  purposes of\r\n          his state convictions at  the time of his\r\n          federal  sentencing  under   924(e),  may\r\n          attack his state sentences in Maryland or\r\n          through  federal  habeas  review.     See\r                                                               \r\n          Maleng v. Cook, 490  U.S. 488 (1989).  If\r                                    \r\n          Custis is successful  in attacking  these\r\n          state  sentences, he  may then  apply for\r\n          reopening   of   any   federal   sentence\r\n          enhanced  by  the  state  sentences.   We\r\n          express  no  opinion  on the  appropriate\r\n          disposition of such an application.\r\n\nId. at 1739.  The district court, noting this dicta, held, in\r               \r\n\nan  extensive opinion,  Pettiford v.  United States,  1995 WL\r                                                               \r\n\n464920  (D.  Mass. 1995),  that defendant's  enhanced federal\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nsentence  was  now in  violation  of the  Constitution.   The\r\n\ngovernment has a variety of objections.\r\n\n                      III.  Jurisdiction\r                                                    \r\n\n          The  district court concluded from the Custis dicta\r                                                                   \r\n\nthat   2255 was the appropriate  vehicle by which to proceed.\r\n\nThe  government  objects  on  the ground  that  this  section\r\n\napplies only  to prisoners incarcerated \"in  violation of the\r\n\nConstitution  or  laws  of  the  United  States.\"   While  we\r\n\nbelieve,  post,   that  defendant  has  such   a  claim,  the\r                          \r\n\ngovernment's attempt to limit the availability of   2255 that\r\n\npermeates its  case, is  surprising.  Section  2255 reads  as\r\n\nfollows:\r\n\n               A prisoner in custody under sentence\r\n          of a court established by Act of Congress\r\n          claiming  the right  to be  released upon\r\n          the  ground that  [1]  the  sentence  was\r\n          imposed in violation of  the Constitution\r\n          or laws of the United States, or that [2]\r\n          the  court  was  without jurisdiction  to\r\n          impose  such sentence,  or  that [3]  the\r\n          sentence was  in  excess of  the  maximum\r\n          authorized by  law, or [4] is   otherwise\r                                                               \r\n          subject  to  collateral attack,  may move\r                                                    \r\n          the  court which imposed  the sentence to\r\n          vacate, set aside or correct the sentence\r\n          . . . .\r\n\n(emphasis supplied.)   Item  4 stands by  itself sufficiently\r\n\nwithout our having to resort  to the familiar principle  that\r\n\nadditional  language  is  presumably   separately  meaningful\r\n\nrather than redundant.  Indeed, we  have previously held that\r\n\nthe   fourth  prong   of     2255   encompasses  other   than\r\n\nconstitutional or statutory error.   See, e.g., United States\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nv. DiRusso, 548 F.2d 372, 374-75 (1st Cir. 1976) (noting that\r                      \r\n\n  2255 is often a vehicle for correcting sentences based upon\r\n\nerrors made  by the sentencing  judge).  However,  whether on\r\n\nconstitutional  or  grounds otherwise  subject  to collateral\r\n\nattack, we  concur with  the district court's  recognition of\r\n\nfederal habeas jurisdiction.\r\n\n       IV. Timing of Determination of Criminal History\r                                                                  \r\n\n          18   U.S.C.     921(a)(20),   the  statute   hereto\r\n\nappertaining, provides in relevant part:\r\n\n               What  constitutes  a  conviction  of\r\n          such  a  crime  shall  be  determined  in\r\n          accordance   with   the   law    of   the\r\n          jurisdiction  in  which  the  proceedings\r\n          were held.  Any conviction which has been\r\n          expunged, or  set  aside or  for which  a\r\n          person has been pardoned or has had civil\r\n          rights restored shall not be considered a\r\n          conviction for purposes  of this  chapter\r\n          . . . .\r\n\nThe government contends that the past tense phrases \"has been\r\n\nexpunged\" and  \"has been  pardoned,\" indicate that  only past\r\n\noffenses  vacated  prior to  the  federal  proceeding may  be\r\n\ndiscounted by  the court,  in effect etching  the defendant's\r\n\ncriminal history  record in stone as  of that moment.   We do\r\n\nnot agree.  The wording would read equally well if applied to\r\n\nconvictions   expunged,  etc.,  subsequent   to  the  federal\r\n\nsentencing.\r\n\n          Thus with the rule of lenity,  see United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nBoots, 80 F.3d 580, 588 (1st Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 117 S.\r                                                                 \r\n\nCt. 263, 65 U.S.L.W. 3265 (U.S. Oct. 07, 1996) (No. 96-5631),\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nthe government is on the short end.  And  with the procedural\r\n\nrule announced in Custis, that it is only after sentence that\r                                    \r\n\na defendant  may attack  the convictions that  contributed to\r\n\nit,  what sense would it make to  say that he may attack pre-\r\n\nsentence convictions, but  not one whose flaw  did not appear\r\n\nuntil  after the  federal  sentence?   Obviously this  is the\r\n\nsituation  every time  it  is defendant  who establishes  the\r\n\nflaw.  The district court was correct.  United States v.

In the Dorchester  District Court\r\n\nthere were  tapes, but they  were unintelligible.   One court\r\n\ndemonstrably,   and   the  other   apparently,   applied  the\r\n\nMassachusetts  rule that the burden  is on the  state to show\r\n\nthe voluntariness of the  plea, Commonwealth v.

Before\r\n\nCustis,  it  was permissible  for  a defendant  to  raise the\r                  \r\n\ninvalidity  of  his state  convictions  at  the time  of  his\r\n\nfederal sentencing.

Because the defendant  did not do so,  the\r\n\ngovernment  attempts   to  invoke  the  rule   of  cause  and\r\n\nprejudice.    See  Coleman v.

Pettiford (hereinafter defendant) was convicted of being a felon-in-possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1).  Because he had nine prior state convictions for violent felonies, he received a minimum mandatory sentence of fifteen years pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(1).  In 1994, all but one of the prior convictions were vacated by the Massachusetts state courts, and in 1995 the district court granted federal habeas corpus relief under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 in the form of a sentence reduction, on the ground that the ACCA was now inapplicable to the computation.  On the government's appeal, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately two years after his federal sentencing, defendant requested audiotapes of his earlier guilty pleas and sentencings in Boston Municipal Court and Dorchester District Court.  He was unsuccessful in obtaining useful tapes, post, and subsequently attempted to reconstruct the proceedings through the use of affidavits.  Ultimately, the courts vacated eight of the nine convictions.  The Boston Municipal Court judge, finding no record that the trial judge had engaged in any colloquy with the defendant at the time of his guilty plea, vacated the convictions on the ground that the Commonwealth had failed to carry its burden of producing a \"contemporaneous record affirmatively [showing] that the defendant waived his rights voluntarily and knowingly,\" as required under the federal Constitution and Massachusetts law.  The Dorchester District Court apparently did the same.  On the habeas petition, our district court, taking what would, initially, seem to us the equitable view, granted the relief and resentenced defendant to the term served, four and one half years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government appeals, and with indignation:  the state action had been a \"windfall;\" the government had been \"sandbagged.\"   In view of the fact that the mandatory enhancement was based entirely upon the state's action in convicting,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and not simply a case where enhancement is permitted for charges with no findings, see, e.g., U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3(e), to complain of state windfalls and government sandbagging is strong language.  The government criticizes the state's procedure as if the vacated convictions were federal property, and the defendant as if he were attempting a trespass.  We are induced to start with the opposite approach.  First, however, we must consider a Supreme Court case, Custis v. United States, 511 U.S. 485, 114 S.Ct. 1732, 128 L.Ed.2d 517 (1994), decided after the imposition of defendant's original sentence and its affirmance on appeal, United States v. Pettiford, 962 F.2d 74 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. United States v. Custis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1994, the Supreme Court in Custis held that under &#167; 924(e), unless a defendant in a federal sentencing proceeding was claiming a violation of his right to counsel, he had no right at that time to make a collateral attack on prior state convictions.  511 U.S. at ----, 114 S.Ct. at 1738.   Rather, the Court observed at the end of the opinion,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize, however, as did the Court of Appeals ... that Custis, who was still \"in custody\" for purposes of his state convictions at the time of his federal sentencing under &#167; 924(e), may attack his state sentences in Maryland or through federal habeas review.  See Maleng v. Cook, 490 U.S. 488, 109 S.Ct. 1923, 104 L.Ed.2d 540 (1989).  If Custis is successful in attacking these state sentences, he may then apply for reopening of any federal sentence enhanced by the state sentences.  We express no opinion on the appropriate disposition of such an application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at ----, 114 S.Ct. at 1739.   The district court, noting this dicta, held, in an extensive opinion, Pettiford v. United States, 1995 WL 464920 (D.Mass.1995), that defendant's enhanced federal sentence was now in violation of the Constitution.  The government has a variety of objections.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Jurisdiction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded from the Custis dicta that &#167; 2255 was the appropriate vehicle by which to proceed.  The government objects on the ground that this section applies only to prisoners incarcerated \"in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States.\"   While we believe, post, that defendant has such a claim, the government's attempt to limit the availability of &#167; 2255 that permeates its case, is surprising.  Section 2255 reads as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A prisoner in custody under sentence of a court established by Act of Congress claiming the right to be released upon the ground that  the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or that  the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that  the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or  is otherwise subject to collateral attack, may move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis supplied.)   Item 4 stands by itself sufficiently without our having to resort to the familiar principle that additional language is presumably separately meaningful rather than redundant.  Indeed, we have previously held that the fourth prong of &#167; 2255 encompasses other than constitutional or statutory error.  See, e.g., United States v. DiRusso, 548 F.2d 372, 374-75 (1st Cir.1976) (noting that &#167; 2255 is often a vehicle for correcting sentences based upon errors made by the sentencing judge).  However, whether on constitutional or grounds otherwise subject to collateral attack, we concur with the district court's recognition of federal habeas jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>IV. Timing of Determination of Criminal History</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(20), the statute hereto appertaining, provides in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What constitutes a conviction of such a crime shall be determined in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings were held.  Any conviction which has been expunged, or set aside or for which a person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored shall not be considered a conviction for purposes of this chapter....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contends that the past tense phrases \"has been expunged\" and \"has been pardoned,\" indicate that only past offenses vacated prior to the federal proceeding may be discounted by the court, in effect etching the defendant's criminal history record in stone as of that moment.  We do not agree.  The wording would read equally well if applied to convictions expunged, etc., subsequent to the federal sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus with the rule of lenity, see United States v. Boots, 80 F.3d 580, 588 (1st Cir.1996), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 263, 136 L.Ed.2d 188 (1996), the government is on the short end.  And with the procedural rule announced in Custis, that it is only after sentence that a defendant may attack the convictions that contributed to it, what sense would it make to say that he may attack pre-sentence convictions, but not one whose flaw did not appear until after the federal sentence?   Obviously this is the situation every time it is defendant who establishes the flaw.  The district court was correct.  United States v. Cox, 83 F.3d 336 (10th Cir.1996).  See also United States v. Bacon, 94 F.3d 158, 162 n. 3 (4th Cir.1996);  Young v. Vaughn, 83 F.3d 72, 77 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 333, 136 L.Ed.2d 245 (1996);  United States v. Hofierka, 83 F.3d 357, 364 (11th Cir.), modified on other grounds on denial of reh'g, 92 F.3d 1108 (11th Cir.1996).  No circuit has indicated otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. Basis for Vacation of State Convictions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have said, defendant's motions to vacate the state convictions were based on the ground that he had not been furnished by the courts, before accepting his guilty pleas, the information necessary for his pleas to be considered voluntary, a constitutional requirement.  See Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 242-43, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 1711-12, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969);  United States v. Houlihan, 92 F.3d 1271, 1279 (1st Cir.1996).  For the Boston Municipal Court cases there were no records, presumably because more than two and a half years had elapsed since the plea and they had been destroyed pursuant to permissive Rule 211A(4).  In the Dorchester District Court there were tapes, but they were unintelligible.  One court demonstrably, and the other apparently, applied the Massachusetts rule that the burden is on the state to show the voluntariness of the plea, Commonwealth v. Duquette, 386 Mass. 834, 841, 438 N.E.2d 334 (1982), and granted the motions to vacate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This distresses the government, evoking the charges of windfalls and sandbagging.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  It makes an elaborate argument, based on the fact that the state courts could have applied a presumption of correctness and found the plea hearings valid, see Parke v. Raley, 506 U.S. 20, 31, 113 S.Ct. 517, 524, 121 L.Ed.2d 391 (1992), and that the Massachusetts courts did not go so far as to hold the convictions unconstitutional.  Putting aside the fact that the Boston Municipal Court judge specifically found a Boykin violation, we do not attach consequences to such recondite thinking.  The short answer is that Congress chose to predicate sentence enhancement on state action.  Surely it is not for the federal court to read the statutory language, \"in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings were held\" as permitting us to conclude that the Massachusetts lower court decisions were wrongly decided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government makes a further point.  Before Custis, it was permissible for a defendant to raise the invalidity of his state convictions at the time of his federal sentencing.  United States v. Paleo, 967 F.2d 7, 11 (1st Cir.1992).  Because the defendant did not do so, the government attempts to invoke the rule of cause and prejudice.  See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 750, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 2565, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991).  It presses this particularly because, federal-wise, the burden would have been on the defendant to prove an inadequate plea colloquy, see United States v. Wilkinson, 926 F.2d 22, 28 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1211, 111 S.Ct. 2813, 115 L.Ed.2d 985 (1991), overruled on other grounds by Bailey v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ----, 116 S.Ct. 501, 509, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995), and having no memory on the subject one way or the other, he would have had no proof.  Our reaction is the opposite of the government's.  With no memory there was no affirmative waiver.  Exceptional circumstances may excuse a delayed making of a claim, Knight v. United States, 37 F.3d 769, 773 (1st Cir.1994), and ignorance may be a factor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if Custis is not regarded as retroactive, it indicates the acceptability of this post-sentence proceeding.  We are content to recognize the district court's discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(1) reads:</p>\n        <p>In the case of a person who violates section 922(g) of this title and has three previous convictions by any court referred to in section 922(g)(1) of this title for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another, such person shall be fined not more than $25,000 and imprisoned not less than fifteen years, and, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the court shall not suspend the sentence of, or grant a probationary sentence to, such person with respect to the conviction under section 922(g).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> See illuminating discussion in United States v.

The Boston Municipal Court judge, finding no record that the trial judge had engaged in any colloquy with the defendant at the time of his guilty plea, vacated the convictions on the ground that the Commonwealth had failed to carry its burden of producing a \"contemporaneous record affirmatively [showing] that the defendant waived his rights voluntarily and knowingly,\" as required under the federal Constitution and Massachusetts law.  The Dorchester District Court apparently did the same.  On the habeas petition, our district court, taking what would, initially, seem to us the equitable view, granted the relief and resentenced defendant to the term served, four and one half years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government appeals, and with indignation:  the state action had been a \"windfall;\" the government had been \"sandbagged.\"   In view of the fact that the mandatory enhancement was based entirely upon the state's action in convicting,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and not simply a case where enhancement is permitted for charges with no findings, see, e.g., U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3(e), to complain of state windfalls and government sandbagging is strong language.  The government criticizes the state's procedure as if the vacated convictions were federal property, and the defendant as if he were attempting a trespass.  We are induced to start with the opposite approach.  First, however, we must consider a Supreme Court case, Custis v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087955\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087955/custis-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">485</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087955\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087955/custis-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Pettiford, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"582530\"><a href=\"/opinion/582530/united-states-v-brian-a-pettiford/\"><span class=\"volume\">962</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. United States v. Custis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1994, the Supreme Court in Custis held that under &#167; 924(e), unless a defendant in a federal sentencing proceeding was claiming a violation of his right to counsel, he had no right at that time to make a collateral attack on prior state convictions.  511 U.S. at ----, 114 S.Ct. at 1738.   Rather, the Court observed at the end of the opinion,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize, however, as did the Court of Appeals ... that Custis, who was still \"in custody\" for purposes of his state convictions at the time of his federal sentencing under &#167; 924(e), may attack his state sentences in Maryland or through federal habeas review.  See Maleng v. Cook, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112262\"><a href=\"/opinion/112262/maleng-v-cook/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">488</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112262\"><a href=\"/opinion/112262/maleng-v-cook/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1923</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112262\"><a href=\"/opinion/112262/maleng-v-cook/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">540</span></a></span> (1989).  If Custis is successful in attacking these state sentences, he may then apply for reopening of any federal sentence enhanced by the state sentences.  We express no opinion on the appropriate disposition of such an application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at ----, 114 S.Ct. at 1739.   The district court, noting this dicta, held, in an extensive opinion, Pettiford v. United States, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">464920</span></span> (D.Mass.1995), that defendant's enhanced federal sentence was now in violation of the Constitution.  The government has a variety of objections.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Jurisdiction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded from the Custis dicta that &#167; 2255 was the appropriate vehicle by which to proceed.  The government objects on the ground that this section applies only to prisoners incarcerated \"in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States.\"   While we believe, post, that defendant has such a claim, the government's attempt to limit the availability of &#167; 2255 that permeates its case, is surprising.  Section 2255 reads as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A prisoner in custody under sentence of a court established by Act of Congress claiming the right to be released upon the ground that  the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or that  the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that  the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or  is otherwise subject to collateral attack, may move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis supplied.)   Item 4 stands by itself sufficiently without our having to resort to the familiar principle that additional language is presumably separately meaningful rather than redundant.  Indeed, we have previously held that the fourth prong of &#167; 2255 encompasses other than constitutional or statutory error.  See, e.g., United States v. DiRusso, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"342413\"><a href=\"/opinion/342413/united-states-v-anthony-j-dirusso/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">372</span></a></span>, 374-75 (1st Cir.1976) (noting that &#167; 2255 is often a vehicle for correcting sentences based upon errors made by the sentencing judge).  However, whether on constitutional or grounds otherwise subject to collateral attack, we concur with the district court's recognition of federal habeas jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>IV. Timing of Determination of Criminal History</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(20), the statute hereto appertaining, provides in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What constitutes a conviction of such a crime shall be determined in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings were held.  Any conviction which has been expunged, or set aside or for which a person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored shall not be considered a conviction for purposes of this chapter....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contends that the past tense phrases \"has been expunged\" and \"has been pardoned,\" indicate that only past offenses vacated prior to the federal proceeding may be discounted by the court, in effect etching the defendant's criminal history record in stone as of that moment.  We do not agree.  The wording would read equally well if applied to convictions expunged, etc., subsequent to the federal sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus with the rule of lenity, see United States v. Boots, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196657\"><a href=\"/opinion/196657/united-states-v-boots/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">580</span></a></span>, 588 (1st Cir.1996), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></span> (1996), the government is on the short end.  And with the procedural rule announced in Custis, that it is only after sentence that a defendant may attack the convictions that contributed to it, what sense would it make to say that he may attack pre-sentence convictions, but not one whose flaw did not appear until after the federal sentence?   Obviously this is the situation every time it is defendant who establishes the flaw.  The district court was correct.  United States v. Cox, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"153368\"><a href=\"/opinion/153368/united-states-v-cox/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">336</span></a></span> (10th Cir.1996).

No circuit has indicated otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. Basis for Vacation of State Convictions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have said, defendant's motions to vacate the state convictions were based on the ground that he had not been furnished by the courts, before accepting his guilty pleas, the information necessary for his pleas to be considered voluntary, a constitutional requirement.  See Boykin v. Alabama, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107951\"><a href=\"/opinion/107951/boykin-v-alabama/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span>, 242-43, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107951\"><a href=\"/opinion/107951/boykin-v-alabama/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1709</span></a></span>, 1711-12, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107951\"><a href=\"/opinion/107951/boykin-v-alabama/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span> (1969);  United States v. Houlihan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196936\"><a href=\"/opinion/196936/united-states-v-houlihan/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1271</span></a></span>, 1279 (1st Cir.1996).  For the Boston Municipal Court cases there were no records, presumably because more than two and a half years had elapsed since the plea and they had been destroyed pursuant to permissive Rule 211A(4).  In the Dorchester District Court there were tapes, but they were unintelligible.  One court demonstrably, and the other apparently, applied the Massachusetts rule that the burden is on the state to show the voluntariness of the plea, Commonwealth v. Duquette, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2102848\"><a href=\"/opinion/2102848/commonwealth-v-duquette/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">834</span></a></span>, 841, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2102848\"><a href=\"/opinion/2102848/commonwealth-v-duquette/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">334</span></a></span> (1982), and granted the motions to vacate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This distresses the government, evoking the charges of windfalls and sandbagging.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  It makes an elaborate argument, based on the fact that the state courts could have applied a presumption of correctness and found the plea hearings valid, see Parke v. Raley, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></span>, 31, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></span>, 524, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">391</span></span> (1992), and that the Massachusetts courts did not go so far as to hold the convictions unconstitutional.  Putting aside the fact that the Boston Municipal Court judge specifically found a Boykin violation, we do not attach consequences to such recondite thinking.  The short answer is that Congress chose to predicate sentence enhancement on state action.  Surely it is not for the federal court to read the statutory language, \"in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings were held\" as permitting us to conclude that the Massachusetts lower court decisions were wrongly decided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government makes a further point.  Before Custis, it was permissible for a defendant to raise the invalidity of his state convictions at the time of his federal sentencing.  United States v. Paleo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"585215\"><a href=\"/opinion/585215/united-states-v-robert-paleo-united-states-v-robert-p-paleo/\"><span class=\"volume\">967</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 11 (1st Cir.1992).  Because the defendant did not do so, the government attempts to invoke the rule of cause and prejudice.  See Coleman v. Thompson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112640\"><a href=\"/opinion/112640/coleman-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">722</span></a></span>, 750, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112640\"><a href=\"/opinion/112640/coleman-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span> (1991).  It presses this particularly because, federal-wise, the burden would have been on the defendant to prove an inadequate plea colloquy, see United States v. Wilkinson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556387\"><a href=\"/opinion/556387/united-states-v-robert-j-wilkinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 28 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1211</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
