ZARRILLI\n\n\n                       VINCENT F. ZARRILLI,\n\n                        Debtor, Appellant,\n\n                                v.\n\n              FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION,\n\n                       Creditor, Appellee,\n\n         DOREEN B.

Joan N. Feeney, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge]\n\n\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                     Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                   Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\f     Vincent F. Zarrilli on brief pro se.\n     Ann S. DuRoss, Assistant General Counsel, Colleen J. Boles,\nSenior Counsel, and Jaclyn C. Taner, Counsel, on brief for\nappellee Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\n\n\n\n\n                         JUNE 28, 2001\n\f            Per Curiam.       In this appeal, pro se appellant\n\nVincent     F.    Zarrilli   appeals     from    a   decision   by   the\n\nBankruptcy Appellate Panel (\"BAP\") affirming the bankruptcy\n\ncourt's denial of certain motions he filed in two bankruptcy\n\nproceedings.       In its decision, the BAP concluded that the\n\ndoctrine of res judicata barred Zarrilli's claims.                    We\n\naffirm, essentially for the reasons given by the BAP in its\n\ndecision dated April 19, 2000.\n\n            In the present appeal, Zarrilli disputes the BAP's\n\nruling in only one pertinent respect.                He suggests that\n\nrulings by this court in a prior appeal were not decisions\n\n\"on   the   merits\"    for   res   judicata     purposes   because   the\n\nrulings failed to adequately explain the court's adverse\n\ndecision.        We find this claim meritless.         The rulings in\n\nquestion did explain the decision reached by the court, and,\n\nin any event, a court's failure to explain a decision does\n\nnot mean that the decision is not \"on the merits.\"               See C.\n\nWright, A. Miller & E. Cooper, 18 Fed. Prac & Proc. § 4435,\n\nat 348 (2001 Supp.) (\"Finally, it should be clear that a\n\ndecision may be 'on the merits' even though it is reached\n\nwithout opinion or other explanation.\") (citations omitted).\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n            -4-\n\f",
