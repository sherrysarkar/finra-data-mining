Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                         Selya, Circuit Judge\n                  Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Boudin, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n    Christopher J. Hightower on brief pro se.\n    Michael B. Grant on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                          October 30, 2000\n\f            Per      Curiam.        Christopher        J.    Hightower       appeals\n\npro se from a judgment entered in favor of various officials\n\nat   the    Rhode      Island           Adult   Correctional        Institutions\n\nfollowing a bench trial, as well from the denial of a post-\n\njudgment motion pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b).                                  The\n\nclaims that went to trial stem from events that occurred in\n\n1993 when Hightower was a pretrial detainee.                             Hightower\n\nalleged that prison officials violated his rights under the\n\nFirst    Amendment      by    disciplining          him     in   retaliation        for\n\nexpressing      an    intent       to    file   a   grievance.          He   further\n\nalleged that his disciplinary hearing did not comport with\n\nthe due process requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nHightower also alleged several state claims.                        The district\n\ncourt concluded that Hightower failed to meet his burden as\n\nto each of these claims.                 We affirm.\n\n            Hightower's main argument is that the district\n\ncourt erred in its factual finding of no retaliation.                                We\n\nreview a district court's factual findings for clear error.\n\nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a).                 Our deference is even greater\n\nwhere,     as   here,        the    factual         findings      are    based       on\n\ncredibility       determinations.               See   Anderson      v.       City    of\n\nBessermer City, 470 U.S. 564, 575 (1985); United States v.\n\nRostoff, 164 F.3d 63, 71 (1st Cir. 1999).                         In such cases,\n\f\"error is seldom considered 'clear' unless the credibility\n\nassessments were based on testimony which was inherently\n\nimplausible,     internally           inconsistent,             or     critically\n\nimpeached.'\" Keller v. United States, 38 F.3d 16, 25 (1 st\n\nCir. 1994).\n\n          We   discern     no   clear       error       here.         Contrary      to\n\nHightower's    suggestion,       we    are       not    persuaded          that    the\n\ntestimony of prison officials was critically impeached at\n\ntrial.   Nor do we think that Hightower's late-filed list of\n\n\"punishable conduct,\" attached to the Rule 60(b) motion,\n\ndemonstrates     that    defendant          Yahn        lied     or        that    the\n\ndisciplinary board must have acted from an improper motive\n\nin finding him guilty of threatening (but not guilty of\n\nswearing).     In   this   regard,          we   note     that       the    text    of\n\ndisciplinary     rule    (d)--        governing         both     swearing          and\n\nthreatening--is     arguably      ambiguous,            and     Yahn's        stated\n\ninterpretation      is   not     obviously             wrong.          Under       the\n\ncircumstances, we also find no abuse of discretion in the\n\ndenial of the Rule 60(b) motion.                 See Ahmed v. Rosenblatt,\n\n118 F.3d 886, 891 (1st Cir.1997) (denial of Rule 60(b)\n\nmotion reviewed for abuse of discretion), cert. denied, 522\n\nU.S. 1148 (1998).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f         We have carefully considered Hightower's remaining\n\narguments and find them to be without merit.   The district\n\ncourt considered the proffered testimony of Janet Speck.\n\nThe proffered evidence would have been insufficient reason\n\nto set aside the district court's factual findings even if\n\nit had been introduced.     Hightower makes no persuasive\n\nargument that the district court erred in concluding that he\n\nfailed to prove his due process claim, and he makes no\n\nargument at all directed at his state law claims.\n\n         Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                            -4-\n\f",
