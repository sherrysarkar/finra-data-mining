Feinstein, Acting General Counsel, Linda Sher,\r\nAssociate General Counsel, and Aileen A. Armstrong, Deputy\r\nAssociate General Counsel, were on brief for respondent.\r\n\nJune 10, 1998\r\n\nPer Curiam.  Wallace International de Puerto Rico, Inc.,\r\nand International Silver de Puerto Rico, Inc. (together \"Wallace\")\r\npetition for review of an order of the National Labor Relations\r\nBoard.  That NLRB order, upholding a decision of an administrative\r\nlaw judge, determined that Wallace fired an employee because of his\r\nunion activity in violation of 29 U.S.C.  158(a)(1), (3) (1994). \r\nWe affirm the NLRB's decision as we find it to be supported by\r\nsubstantial evidence in the record, and therefore grant the NLRB's\r\ncross-application for the order's enforcement.  See McGaw of P.R.,\r\nInc. v. NLRB, 135 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\nThe record supports the NLRB's decision that Wallace was\r\nhostile to union activity, and particularly to that of the employee\r\nin question, Eddie Hernandez.  The administrative law judge\r\ncredited testimony that a supervisor had stated that he had\r\ninstructions to \"watch\" Hernandez because of his pro-union efforts.\r\nUnlike other problem employees who were suspended from\r\nwork after repeated warnings, Hernandez was never suspended, but\r\ninstead was fired after receiving several warnings concerning his\r\nconduct.  Even if Hernandez' disciplinary record was arguably\r\nsomewhat worse than that of other employees, his infractions were\r\nnot met with progressive disciplinary measures applied to others.\r\nThe offense that supposedly precipitated Hernandez' discharge was\r\nan admittedly minor infraction (spending too long in the bathroom). \r\nWallace offered no evidence that any other employee had been fired\r\nfor insubordinate conduct and no general standards explaining the\r\nlevel of misconduct that could result in a discharge.\r\nUnder all the circumstances, and giving due deference to\r\nthe expertise of the administrative law judge and the NLRB, 29\r\nU.S.C.  160(e), we believe there is substantial evidence\r\nsupporting the NLRB's finding that Hernandez' firing was motivated\r\nat least in part by his union activities and was not simply \"for\r\ncause.\"  Similarly, we uphold the NLRB's finding that Wallace has\r\nfailed to show that it would have discharged Hernandez for his\r\nmisconduct alone.  See NLRB v. Transportation Management Corp., 462\r\nU.S. 393, 395 (1983).\r\nHernandez was by no means a model worker.  Should he\r\nreturn to work, he is subject to discipline for any future\r\nmisconduct on the same basis as other employees so long as the\r\ndiscipline is occasioned by misconduct and not by union-related\r\nactivity.\r\nThe petition for review is denied and the NLRB's order is\r\nhereby enforced.\n",
