Hewlett-Packard  appeals from an\r                                      \r\n\norder of  the district court confirming  an arbitration award\r\n\nrendered in a business dispute  with appellees Helge Berg and\r\n\nLars Skoog  and rejecting  Hewlett-Packard's  requests for  a\r\n\nstay of the confirmation proceeding  or a declaration that it\r\n\nis entitled to  a set-off for the  award.  The case  presents\r\n\nseveral difficult  legal issues which can  be understood only\r\n\nafter a brief description of the facts and prior proceedings.\r\n\n                        I.  BACKGROUND\r                                    I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n     In March  1982, Apollo  Computer, now owned  by Hewlett-\r\n\nPackard, entered  into  a two-year  distributorship  contract\r\n\nwith a Swedish company  called Dicoscan Distributed  Computer\r\n\nScandinavia  to  sell  Hewlett-Packard  products  in  several\r\n\nNordic countries.  The 1982 contract included an agreement to\r\n\nsubmit any dispute under the contract to binding arbitration.\r\n\nIn  March 1984,  the parties  executed a  new distributorship\r\n\ncontract, which also contained an arbitration clause.\r\n\n     In  the  meantime,   during  1983  and   1984,  Dicoscan\r\n\nexperienced financial  problems.  In mid-1984, Apollo claimed\r\n\nthat  Dicoscan was far behind in its payments.  In September,\r\n\nApollo terminated  the 1984 agreement.   The following month,\r\n\nDicoscan filed for bankruptcy.  The bankruptcy court assigned\r\n\nto Berg  and Skoog, directors  and officers of  Dicoscan, the\r\n\nright to bring claims against Apollo based on the contracts.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\n     Berg and Skoog filed a request  for arbitration with the\r\n\nInternational  Chamber  of  Commerce  Court  of  Arbitration,\r\n\nclaiming  millions  of  dollars  of damages  arising  out  of\r\n\nApollo's   unilateral  termination  of  the  1984  agreement.\r\n\nApollo counterclaimed  in the  arbitration by asserting  that\r\n\nthe  Swedish company had failed  to pay about  $10,000 due on\r\n\nthe  1984  contract and  about  $207,000 due  under  the 1982\r\n\ncontract.   After a dispute  about Berg and  Skoog's right to\r\n\ninvoke arbitration, see   Apollo Computer, Inc. v. Berg,  886\r                                                                   \r\n\nF.2d 469, 473 (1st Cir. 1989),  an arbitration proceeding was\r\n\nbegun.\r\n\n     The arbitrators  were required by the parties' contracts\r\n\nto  apply Massachusetts  law.    Ultimately, the  arbitrators\r\n\nawarded around $700,000 plus interest  to Berg and Skoog, but\r\n\nallowed a  set-off for the  $10,000 that Dicoscan  still owed\r\n\nApollo  under the 1984 contract.   To both parties' surprise,\r\n\nthe tribunal held that it was without  jurisdiction to decide\r\n\nApollo's more  substantial claim based on  the 1982 contract,\r\n\nruling that the  1982 contract  was not within  the Terms  of\r\n\nReference issued by  the arbitrators at the beginning  of the\r\n\nproceeding.\r\n\n     As a  result, Apollo was left with  a sizable obligation\r\n\nto  Berg   and  Skoog   on  the   1984  contract   without  a\r\n\ndetermination of its claim for more than $207,000 on the 1982\r\n\ncontract.  Apollo unilaterally decided to pay the arbitration\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\naward  amount  but  subtracted  the  $207,000  plus  interest\r\n\n(together,  about  $300,000)  as  a  \"setoff in  recoupment,\"\r\n\nwhich,  it  said,  is  a  time-honored  common  law  doctrine\r\n\nembraced  in  Massachusetts  courts.   Apollo  also  filed  a\r\n\nrequest with the tribunal  for a second arbitration regarding\r\n\nthe  1982 contract.  That tribunal has indicated that it will\r\n\nhear the arbitration.\r\n\n     In  January  1993,   Apollo  (later  succeeded  as   the\r\n\nplaintiff by  Hewlett-Packard)  filed the  complaint in  this\r\n\naction  with  the  Massachusetts  district  court.   Hewlett-\r\n\nPackard requested  that the  district court (1)  declare that\r\n\nHewlett-Packard was entitled to the $207,000 set-off and that\r\n\nthe arbitration award is fully satisfied, and (2) vacate  the\r\n\ntribunal's  award  and  correct it.    Hewlett-Packard  later\r\n\nwithdrew its second claim for relief.\r\n\n     Berg and  Skoog moved to dismiss  the complaint, arguing\r\n\nthat  such declaratory  relief is  unavailable as  to foreign\r\n\narbitration  awards.    Later,   Berg  and  Skoog  moved  for\r\n\nconfirmation  of  the  arbitration  award.    Hewlett-Packard\r\n\nopposed  confirmation of  the award  on  the ground  that, by\r\n\nfailing to include  its 1982 set-off, the  award was contrary\r\n\nto public policy.   In the alternative, Hewlett-Packard moved\r\n\nto  stay  confirmation, pending  the  outcome  of the  second\r\n\narbitration.  Hewlett-Packard also  asked the court to compel\r\n\narbitration as to its 1982 claim.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\n     On  November  7,  1994,   the  district  judge  filed  a\r\n\nmemorandum, together with a  separate order, disposing of all\r\n\nof these  motions.   The court's order  compelled arbitration\r\n\nunder the 1982 contract but it confirmed the award previously\r\n\nmade by the  tribunal on the 1984  contract.  The  court said\r\n\nthat  it   was  without   power  to  stay   the  confirmation\r\n\nproceeding, as  Hewlett-Packard had  requested, and  that the\r\n\nrequest for a set-off  was an improper attempt to  modify the\r\n\ntribunal's award.  \r\n\n     Apparently   ready   to   enforce    the   now-confirmed\r\n\narbitration award, Berg  and Skoog moved the court  for entry\r\n\nof  final  judgment,  and   proffered  a  detailed   judgment\r\n\nspecifying  the award,  interest and  attorney's fees.   Four\r\n\ndays later,  Hewlett-Packard filed  its notice of  appeal and\r\n\nthereafter filed a response  disputing certain aspects of the\r\n\nproposed judgment.  The  district court has not acted  on the\r\n\nmotion  for entry of final judgment; and no such judgment has\r\n\nbeen entered.\r\n\n                       II.  DISCUSSION\r                                   II.  DISCUSSION\r\n\n     Hewlett-Packard  purports to  appeal  all  three of  the\r\n\ndistrict court's  adverse actions:   the confirmation  of the\r\n\narbitration  award,  the refusal  to  stay  that confirmation\r\n\nproceeding pending the outcome of the second arbitration; and\r\n\nthe rejection of Hewlett-Packard's set-off claim declaration.\r\n\nCommendably, Hewlett-Packard  has alerted  us  to a  possible\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\njurisdiction  problem,  which   this  court  is  obliged   to\r\n\nconsider.   We  do  so but  caution  future panels  that  the\r\n\njurisdictional problems have not been briefed in this case.\r\n\n     Nothing  in the  record in  this case  purports to  be a\r\n\n\"final  judgment,\"  set  forth  in  a  separate  document  as\r\n\nrequired  by Fed.  R. Civ.  P. 58,  disposing of  all claims.\r\n\nThus,  in formal  terms there  is  no basis  for appeal  of a\r\n\n\"final  decision\" under 28 U.S.C.    1291, even  if the court\r\n\nactually  resolved all of the  claims before it.   Indeed, as\r\n\nalready  noted, the  defendants  have pending  a motion  that\r\n\nrequests entry of a \"final judgment.\"\r\n\n     Nevertheless,  the  November  7  order,  insofar  as  it\r\n\nconfirms  the arbitration  award, is  appealable now  because\r\n\nCongress  directed  in  the  statute  governing  arbitration-\r\n\nrelated  appeals that  such  an \"order\"  confirming an  award\r\n\nshould be  immediately appealable.   9 U.S.C.    16(a)(1)(D).\r\n\nThe reason  is a pro-arbitration policy  designed to expedite\r\n\nconfirmation  of  arbitration awards.    This  is clear  from\r\n\nprecedent  and  scholarly  commentary.   See,  e.g.,  15B  C.\r                                                               \r\n\nWright, A. Miller &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure\r                                                                         \r\n\n  3914.17, at 9-12, 32-34 (2d ed. 1992).\r\n\n     There  is one  technical  hitch.   Seemingly, the  order\r\n\nconfirming the  award is not  itself a judgment   that can be\r\n\ncollected through court processes until it is entered  on the\r\n\ndocket as a judgment.  See  9 U.S.C.   13.  This has  nothing\r                                      \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nto  do with the final judgment rule; rather, the statute that\r\n\ngoverns  confirmations provides that  after a confirmation is\r\n\nordered, a separate \"entry of judgment\" must be made pursuant\r\n\nto that  order, and  it  is only  at that  stage that  \"[t]he\r\n\njudgment  so entered . . . may be  enforced as if it had been\r\n\nrendered in an action  in the court in which it  is entered.\"\r\n\nId.\r               \r\n\n     Nevertheless, the Federal  Rules of  Civil Procedure  do\r\n\nnot say that appeals can only be taken from judgments; on the\r\n\ncontrary, they contemplate that, subject to the complex rules\r\n\nthat determine  what is immediately appealable,  there may be\r\n\nsuch a thing as an \"appealable order\" that is not a judgment.\r\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 79(b).   And, as already noted,  Congress has\r\n\ndesignated  as  immediately  appealable   \"an  order  .  .  .\r\n\nconfirming  .  .  . an  [arbitration]  award.\"    9 U.S.C.   \r\n\n16(a)(1)(D).\r\n\n     Our position  is  not at  odds  with Middleby  Corp.  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nHussmann  Corp., 962 F.2d 614 (7th Cir. 1992).  Middleby held\r                                                                    \r\n\nthat no immediate  appeal could be  taken where the  district\r\n\ncourt issued an  order of confirmation but declined  to enter\r\n\njudgment  after  making  a specific  determination  to  delay\r\n\ngiving  effect  to  the  confirmation   order  until  further\r\n\nproceedings were concluded.   Here, by contrast, the district\r\n\ncourt denied  the requested stay, and  the confirmation order\r\n\nis  immediately  effective,  requiring  only  the  filing  of\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\nspecified  papers  with the  clerk  to permit  \"the  entry of\r\n\njudgment thereon.\"  9 U.S.C.   13.\r\n\n     Because the  confirmation order is  appealable, we think\r\n\nthat there is also before us Hewlett-Packard's claim that the\r\n\nconfirmation proceeding should have  been stayed.  The reason\r\n\nis simply that the underlying argument for  a stay is also an\r\n\nobjection to the  confirmation order itself.  To this extent,\r\n\nit is effectively an interlocutory ruling made in the process\r\n\nof approving the confirmation request and like any other such\r\n\ninterlocutory ruling it  is reviewable at  the time that  the\r\n\nconfirmation order  itself  is brought  up  on appeal.    Cf.\r                                                                         \r\n\nStringfellow v. Concerned Neighbors  in Action, 480 U.S. 370,\r                                                          \r\n\n375  (1987); 15A Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, supra,   3905.1, at\r                                                           \r\n\n249-63.\r\n\n     A  similar argument  might  also be  made to  justify an\r\n\nappeal  now based on the  district court's refusal to declare\r\n\nHewlett-Packard's  right to  the  set-off it  asserted.   The\r\n\nproblem is complicated,  but we  see no need  to resolve  the\r\n\ncomplexities.  Whether or  not the refusal to allow  the set-\r\n\noff  is an appealable issue,  the refusal at  this time turns\r\n\nout not to be a legal error, so the jurisdictional issue need\r\n\nnot be decided.  See Norton v. Matthews, 427 U.S. 524, 530-32\r                                                   \r\n\n(1976);  In re Pioneer Ford Sales,  729 F.2d 27, 31 (1st Cir.\r                                             \r\n\n1984).\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\n     We turn now  to the  merits.   Hewlett-Packard does  not\r\n\nobject to the confirmation  of the award in all  respects; it\r\n\nsays  it  has  paid  the award  except  the  disputed  amount\r\n\nincluding  interest.    But  Hewlett-Packard  says  that  the\r\n\ndistrict court erred by confirming  the award in full instead\r\n\nof  either allowing  a  set-off or  granting  a stay  of  the\r\n\nconfirmation pending the results of the new arbitration.\r\n\n     We  agree with  the district  court's rejection  at this\r\n\ntime of the first alternative.  Whether Hewlett-Packard has a\r\n\nvalid   claim  under   the  1982   contract  is   subject  to\r\n\narbitration; we agree  with the district  court--and Hewlett-\r\n\nPackard--that the  tribunal has never resolved  the merits of\r\n\nthat claim.  Whatever the Massachusetts law on set-offs,  the\r\n\ndistrict court could not allow the set-off at present without\r\n\ndetermining that Hewlett-Packard had  a valid claim, which is\r\n\nthe very subject of the arbitration.\r\n\n     It  is hard  to  imagine  a  step  that  would  be  more\r\n\noffensive  to  the   pro-arbitration  policies  reflected  in\r\n\nCongress'  endorsement   of  the   1958  Convention  on   the\r\n\nRecognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, often\r\n\ncalled  the New York Convention.  The New York Convention was\r\n\napproved   by  Congress,  and  implementing  legislation  was\r\n\ncodified at 9 U.S.C.    201-08.  The statute  enlists the aid\r\n\nof federal courts to compel arbitration.  9 U.S.C.   206.  By\r\n\ncontrast,   the   judicial  set-off   requested   here  would\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\ncircumvent the 1982 contract to arbitrate and the now-pending\r\n\narbitration under that contract.\r\n\n     The request to defer confirmation of the award under the\r\n\n1984  contract stands  on a different  footing.   However the\r\n\ncase might stand absent the bankruptcy, Dicoscan's bankruptcy\r\n\ngives Hewlett-Packard a very substantial prudential argument.\r\n\nIf the existing award  were confirmed in full and  reduced to\r\n\njudgment, Hewlett-Packard would have to pay the full award to\r\n\nthe  defendants  as  successors-in-interest of  an  insolvent\r\n\ncompany.  If in due course  Hewlett-Packard then prevailed on\r\n\nits claims against the insolvent company on a closely related\r\n\ntransaction,  it   would  have  no  assurance  of  collecting\r\n\nanything.\r\n\n     Further,  Hewlett-Packard  cannot  be  blamed   for  the\r\n\ndiscrepant timing in the resolution of its claim, or at least\r\n\nno argument to that effect has been made.  After  it was told\r\n\nthat the  defendants did  have arbitration rights  despite an\r\n\nanti-assignment  clause  in  the  contracts,  Hewlett-Packard\r\n\napparently  made  a  reasonable   effort  to  have  both  the\r\n\ndefendants' claim  and its  own counterclaim resolved  in one\r\n\nproceeding  at   the  same  time.     Only  the  arbitrators'\r\n\nsurprising  interpretation  of their mandate frustrated  this\r\n\nattempt.\r\n\n     Under these  circumstances, the seemingly  fair solution\r\n\nwould be  to  confirm  the award  in  its  uncontested  part,\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\nreserving confirmation of the balance until the 1982 contract\r\n\ndispute  is  arbitrated.    The  district  court  refused  to\r\n\nconsider a stay  of confirmation  on the ground  that it  was\r\n\nwithout power to  do so.   We fully understand the  basis for\r\n\nthe  district  court's  doubt  about its  authority,  but  we\r\n\nconclude that it  does have the power to issue  a stay in the\r\n\npeculiar circumstances of this case.\r\n\n     Ordinarily  there  could  be  no  doubt  that  a  court,\r\n\nalthough obliged  to decide a claim,  would retain discretion\r\n\nto  defer  proceedings for  prudential  reasons.   Indeed,  a\r\n\ntypical reason  is the  pendency of a  related proceeding  in\r\n\nanother  tribunal.    \"[T]he  power to  stay  proceedings  is\r\n\nincidental to the  power inherent in  every court to  control\r\n\nthe disposition of the  causes on its docket with  economy of\r\n\ntime and effort for itself, for counsel, and  for litigants.\"\r\n\nLandis v. North Amer. Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254 (1936).\r                                     \r\n\n     The question here is whether this traditional  authority\r\n\nis curtailed  by the New York Convention and its implementing\r\n\nlegislation.  The statute provides that,  upon a petition for\r\n\nconfirmation,  a  district  court \"shall  confirm  the  award\r                                                    \r\n\nunless it finds one of the grounds for refusal or deferral of\r\n\nrecognition or enforcement of the award specified in the said\r\n\nConvention.\"  9 U.S.C.   207 (emphasis added).  Article VI of\r\n\nthe Convention is the only provision that deals  with staying\r\n\nconfirmation.  Article VI states:\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\n     If  an  application   for  the  setting  aside   or\r\n     suspension  of  the  award   has  been  made  to  a\r\n     competent authority [in the country where the award\r\n     has  been made],  the  authority  before which  the\r\n     award  is  sought to  be  relied  upon may,  if  it\r\n     considers it  proper, adjourn  the decision  on the\r\n     enforcement of the award [and require a security].\r\n\nThe circumstances  outlined in  Article VI  do not  appear to\r\n\nexist in this case.  The question is whether a district court\r\n\nmay grant a stay in circumstances other than those authorized\r\n\nin Article VI.\r\n\n     The fact that section  207 uses the word \"shall\"  is not\r\n\ndecisive, because a stay  is a deferral rather  than refusal.\r\n\nBut  the fact that the  statute refers to  the Convention and\r\n\nthe  Convention lists  a single  ground for  a stay  could be\r\n\ntaken  to exclude  all other grounds  under the  principle of\r\n\nexpressio  unius  est  exclusio   alterius.    That  was,  in\r                                                      \r\n\nsubstance,  the reasoning  of the  district court.   However,\r\n\nexpressio  unius  is  an  aid  to  construction  and  not  an\r                            \r\n\ninflexible rule.   See, e.g., United  States v. Massachusetts\r                                                                         \r\n\nBay  Transport.  Auth.,  614 F.2d  27,  28  (1st  Cir. 1980).\r                                  \r\n\nWhatever we might think  if the question were  entirely open,\r\n\nprecedent  informs  our  decision  in this  case.    Domestic\r\n\narbitrations are  governed by  the United  States Arbitration\r\n\nAct (chapter 1 of Title 9) but not by the Convention (chapter\r\n\n2  of Title 9).  The  Act states that, upon application, \"the\r\n\ncourt  must grant [a confirmation] order  unless the award is\r                       \r\n\nvacated, modified, or corrected  as prescribed in sections 10\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                         -12-\r\r\n\nand 11 of this title.\"  9  U.S.C.   9 (emphasis added).   But\r\n\ncourts  routinely grant  stays in  such cases  for prudential\r\n\nreasons  not listed in sections  10 and 11.   E.g., Middleby,\r                                                                        \r\n\n962 F.2d at 615-16.\r\n\n     Similarly, this court has held that district courts have\r\n\ndiscretion to  stay an  action to compel  arbitration pending\r                                                    \r\n\nthe outcome of related litigation, even though the Act states\r\n\nthat on a motion to compel the court \"shall hear the parties\"\r\n\nand  \"shall proceed summarily  to trial.\"  9  U.S.C.   4; see\r                                                                         \r\n\nActon  Corp. v.  Borden, Inc.,  670 F.2d  377, 383  (1st Cir.\r                                         \r\n\n1982).   In Acton,  then-Judge Breyer held  that, in drafting\r                             \r\n\nthe  statute, Congress  did not  \"intend[] a  major departure\r\n\nfrom  the ordinary  rule allowing one  federal court  to stay\r\n\nlitigation when  another federal court  is on the  process of\r\n\ndeciding the same issue.\"  We take the same view of Congress'\r\n\nintentions in implementing the Convention.\r\n\n     Of course, a stay of confirmation should  not be lightly\r\n\ngranted.      A  central   purpose   of  the   Convention--an\r\n\ninternational agreement  to which  the United States  is only\r\n\none of approximately one hundred signatories--was to expedite\r\n\nthe recognition of foreign arbitral  awards with a minimum of\r\n\njudicial interference.  But  the risk that the power  to stay\r\n\ncould  be abused by  disgruntled litigants--real  though that\r\n\nrisk is, see Spier  v. Calzaturificio, 663 F. Supp.  871, 875\r                                                 \r\n\n                             -13-\r                                         -13-\r\r\n\n(S.D.N.Y.  1987)--argues  more  for  a cautious  and  prudent\r\n\nexercise of the power than for its elimination.\r\n\n     Because the district court acted under a misapprehension\r\n\nof its authority, we vacate the confirmation order and remand\r\n\nfor further  proceedings.  Whether confirmation or collection\r\n\nof  the  award  should  be  partially  deferred  pending  the\r\n\nresolution  of the 1982 contract  arbitration is a matter for\r\n\nthe  district  court  to  determine in  the  first  instance.\r\n\nStill,  we think it would require some explanation if, in the\r\n\nface  of  the  equities  of  this case,  the  district  court\r\n\nconcluded  that  the  full  award  should  be  confirmed  and\r\n\ncollected now.\r\n\n     The  confirmation order  is  vacated and  the matter  is\r                                                     \r\n\nremanded  to  the  district  court  for  further  proceedings\r                    \r\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                         -14-\r\r\n",

The case presents several difficult legal issues which can be understood only after a brief description of the facts and prior proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1982, Apollo Computer, now owned by Hewlett-Packard, entered into a two-year distributorship contract with a Swedish company called Dicoscan Distributed Computer Scandinavia to sell Hewlett-Packard products in several Nordic countries.  The 1982 contract included an agreement to submit any dispute under the contract to binding arbitration.  In March 1984, the parties executed a new distributorship contract, which also contained an arbitration clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the meantime, during 1983 and 1984, Dicoscan experienced financial problems.  In mid-1984, Apollo claimed that Dicoscan was far behind in its payments.  In September, Apollo terminated the 1984 agreement.  The following month, Dicoscan filed for bankruptcy.  The bankruptcy court assigned to Berg and Skoog, directors and officers of Dicoscan, the right to bring claims against Apollo based on the contracts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Berg and Skoog filed a request for arbitration with the International Chamber of Commerce Court of Arbitration, claiming millions of dollars of damages arising out of Apollo's unilateral termination of the 1984 agreement.  Apollo counterclaimed in the arbitration by asserting that the Swedish company had failed to pay about $10,000 due on the 1984 contract and about $207,000 due under the 1982 contract.  After a dispute about Berg and Skoog's right to invoke arbitration, see Apollo Computer, Inc. v. Berg, 886 F.2d 469, 473 (1st Cir.1989), an arbitration proceeding was begun.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The arbitrators were required by the parties' contracts to apply Massachusetts law.  Ultimately, the arbitrators awarded around $700,000 plus interest to Berg and Skoog, but allowed a set-off for the $10,000 that Dicoscan still owed Apollo under the 1984 contract.  To both parties' surprise, the tribunal held that it was without jurisdiction to decide Apollo's more substantial claim based on the 1982 contract, ruling that the 1982 contract was not within the Terms of Reference issued by the arbitrators at the beginning of the proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result, Apollo was left with a sizable obligation to Berg and Skoog on the 1984 contract without a determination of its claim for more than $207,000 on the 1982 contract.  Apollo unilaterally decided to pay the arbitration award amount but subtracted the $207,000 plus interest (together, about $300,000) as a \"setoff in recoupment,\" which, it said, is a time-honored common law doctrine embraced in Massachusetts courts.  Apollo also filed a request with the tribunal for a second arbitration regarding the 1982 contract.  That tribunal has indicated that it will hear the arbitration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1993, Apollo (later succeeded as the plaintiff by Hewlett-Packard) filed the complaint in this action with the Massachusetts district court.  Hewlett-Packard requested that the district court (1) declare that Hewlett-Packard was entitled to the $207,000 set-off and that the arbitration award is fully satisfied, and (2) vacate the tribunal's award and correct it.  Hewlett-Packard later withdrew its second claim for relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Berg and Skoog moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that such declaratory relief is unavailable as to foreign arbitration awards.  Later, Berg and Skoog moved for confirmation of the arbitration award.  Hewlett-Packard opposed confirmation of the award on the ground that, by failing to include its 1982 set-off, the award was contrary to public policy.  In the alternative, Hewlett-Packard moved to stay confirmation, pending the outcome of the second arbitration.  Hewlett-Packard also asked the court to compel arbitration as to its 1982 claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 7, 1994, the district judge filed a memorandum, together with a separate order, disposing of all of these motions.  The court's order compelled arbitration under the 1982 contract but it confirmed the award previously made by the tribunal on the 1984 contract.  The court said that it was without power to stay the confirmation proceeding, as Hewlett-Packard had requested, and that the request for a set-off was an improper attempt to modify the tribunal's award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apparently ready to enforce the now-confirmed arbitration award, Berg and Skoog moved the court for entry of final judgment, and proffered a detailed judgment specifying the award, interest and attorney's fees.  Four days later, Hewlett-Packard filed its notice of appeal and thereafter filed a response disputing certain aspects of the proposed judgment.  The district court has not acted on the motion for entry of final judgment;  and no such judgment has been entered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hewlett-Packard purports to appeal all three of the district court's adverse actions:  the confirmation of the arbitration award, the refusal to stay that confirmation proceeding pending the outcome of the second arbitration;  and the rejection of Hewlett-Packard's set-off claim declaration.  Commendably, Hewlett-Packard has alerted us to a possible jurisdiction problem, which this court is obliged to consider.  We do so but caution future panels that the jurisdictional problems have not been briefed in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the record in this case purports to be a \"final judgment,\" set forth in a separate document as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 58, disposing of all claims.  Thus, in formal terms there is no basis for appeal of a \"final decision\" under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1291, even if the court actually resolved all of the claims before it.  Indeed, as already noted, the defendants have pending a motion that requests entry of a \"final judgment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the November 7 order, insofar as it confirms the arbitration award, is appealable now because Congress directed in the statute governing arbitration-related appeals that such an \"order\" confirming an award should be immediately appealable.  9 U.S.C. Sec. 16(a)(1)(D).  The reason is a pro-arbitration policy designed to expedite confirmation of arbitration awards.  This is clear from precedent and scholarly commentary.  See, e.g., 15B C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 3914.17, at 9-12, 32-34 (2d ed. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is one technical hitch.  Seemingly, the order confirming the award is not itself a judgment that can be collected through court processes until it is entered on the docket as a judgment.  See 9 U.S.C. Sec. 13.  This has nothing to do with the final judgment rule;  rather, the statute that governs confirmations provides that after a confirmation is ordered, a separate \"entry of judgment\" must be made pursuant to that order, and it is only at that stage that \"[t]he judgment so entered ... may be enforced as if it had been rendered in an action in the court in which it is entered.\"   Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not say that appeals can only be taken from judgments;  on the contrary, they contemplate that, subject to the complex rules that determine what is immediately appealable, there may be such a thing as an \"appealable order\" that is not a judgment.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 79(b).  And, as already noted, Congress has designated as immediately appealable \"an order ... confirming ... an [arbitration] award.\"  9 U.S.C. Sec. 16(a)(1)(D).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our position is not at odds with Middleby Corp. v. Hussmann Corp., 962 F.2d 614 (7th Cir.1992).  Middleby held that no immediate appeal could be taken where the district court issued an order of confirmation but declined to enter judgment after making a specific determination to delay giving effect to the confirmation order until further proceedings were concluded.  Here, by contrast, the district court denied the requested stay, and the confirmation order is immediately effective, requiring only the filing of specified papers with the clerk to permit \"the entry of judgment thereon.\"  9 U.S.C. Sec. 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the confirmation order is appealable, we think that there is also before us Hewlett-Packard's claim that the confirmation proceeding should have been stayed.  The reason is simply that the underlying argument for a stay is also an objection to the confirmation order itself.  To this extent, it is effectively an interlocutory ruling made in the process of approving the confirmation request and like any other such interlocutory ruling it is reviewable at the time that the confirmation order itself is brought up on appeal.  Cf. Stringfellow v. Concerned Neighbors in Action, 480 U.S. 370, 375, 107 S.Ct. 1177, 1181, 94 L.Ed.2d 389 (1987);  15A Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, supra, Sec. 3905.1, at 249-63.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A similar argument might also be made to justify an appeal now based on the district court's refusal to declare Hewlett-Packard's right to the set-off it asserted. The problem is complicated, but we see no need to resolve the complexities.  Whether or not the refusal to allow the set-off is an appealable issue, the refusal at this time turns out not to be a legal error, so the jurisdictional issue need not be decided.  See Norton v. Mathews, 427 U.S. 524, 530-32, 96 S.Ct. 2771, 2774-76, 49 L.Ed.2d 672 (1976);  In re Pioneer Ford Sales, 729 F.2d 27, 31 (1st Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to the merits.  Hewlett-Packard does not object to the confirmation of the award in all respects;  it says it has paid the award except the disputed amount including interest.  But Hewlett-Packard says that the district court erred by confirming the award in full instead of either allowing a set-off or granting a stay of the confirmation pending the results of the new arbitration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court's rejection at this time of the first alternative.  Whether Hewlett-Packard has a valid claim under the 1982 contract is subject to arbitration;  we agree with the district court--and Hewlett-Packard--that the tribunal has never resolved the merits of that claim.  Whatever the Massachusetts law on set-offs, the district court could not allow the set-off at present without determining that Hewlett-Packard had a valid claim, which is the very subject of the arbitration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is hard to imagine a step that would be more offensive to the pro-arbitration policies reflected in Congress' endorsement of the 1958 Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, often called the New York Convention.  The New York Convention was approved by Congress, and implementing legislation was codified at 9 U.S.C. Secs. 201-08.  The statute enlists the aid of federal courts to compel arbitration.  9 U.S.C. Sec. 206.  By contrast, the judicial set-off requested here would circumvent the 1982 contract to arbitrate and the now-pending arbitration under that contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The request to defer confirmation of the award under the 1984 contract stands on a different footing.  However the case might stand absent the bankruptcy, Dicoscan's bankruptcy gives Hewlett-Packard a very substantial prudential argument.  If the existing award were confirmed in full and reduced to judgment, Hewlett-Packard would have to pay the full award to the defendants as successors-in-interest of an insolvent company.  If in due course Hewlett-Packard then prevailed on its claims against the insolvent company on a closely related transaction, it would have no assurance of collecting anything.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, Hewlett-Packard cannot be blamed for the discrepant timing in the resolution of its claim, or at least no argument to that effect has been made.  After it was told that the defendants did have arbitration rights despite an anti-assignment clause in the contracts, Hewlett-Packard apparently made a reasonable effort to have both the defendants' claim and its own counterclaim resolved in one proceeding at the same time.  Only the arbitrators' surprising interpretation of their mandate frustrated this attempt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, the seemingly fair solution would be to confirm the award in its uncontested part, reserving confirmation of the balance until the 1982 contract dispute is arbitrated.  The district court refused to consider a stay of confirmation on the ground that it was without power to do so.  We fully understand the basis for the district court's doubt about its authority, but we conclude that it does have the power to issue a stay in the peculiar circumstances of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily there could be no doubt that a court, although obliged to decide a claim, would retain discretion to defer proceedings for prudential reasons.  Indeed, a typical reason is the pendency of a related proceeding in another tribunal.  \"[T]he power to stay proceedings is incidental to the power inherent in every court to control the disposition of the causes on its docket with economy of time and effort for itself, for counsel, and for litigants.\"  Landis v. North Amer.  Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254, 57 S.Ct. 163, 166, 81 L.Ed. 153 (1936).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question here is whether this traditional authority is curtailed by the New York Convention and its implementing legislation.  The statute provides that, upon a petition for confirmation, a district court \"shall confirm the award unless it finds one of the grounds for refusal or deferral of recognition or enforcement of the award specified in the said Convention.\"  9 U.S.C. Sec. 207 (emphasis added).  Article VI of the Convention is the only provision that deals with staying confirmation.  Article VI states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>If an application for the setting aside or suspension of the award has been made to a competent authority [in the country where the award has been made], the authority before which the award is sought to be relied upon may, if it considers it proper, adjourn the decision on the enforcement of the award [and require a security].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circumstances outlined in Article VI do not appear to exist in this case.  The question is whether a district court may grant a stay in circumstances other than those authorized in Article VI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that section 207 uses the word \"shall\" is not decisive, because a stay is a deferral rather than refusal.  But the fact that the statute refers to the Convention and the Convention lists a single ground for a stay could be taken to exclude all other grounds under the principle of expressio unius est exclusio alterius.   That was, in substance, the reasoning of the district court.  However, expressio unius is an aid to construction and not an inflexible rule.  See, e.g., United States v. Massachusetts Bay Transport.  Auth., 614 F.2d 27, 28 (1st Cir.1980).  Whatever we might think if the question were entirely open, precedent informs our decision in this case.  Domestic arbitrations are governed by the United States Arbitration Act (chapter 1 of Title 9) but not by the Convention (chapter 2 of Title 9).  The Act states that, upon application, \"the court must grant [a confirmation] order unless the award is vacated, modified, or corrected as prescribed in sections 10 and 11 of this title.\"  9 U.S.C. Sec. 9 (emphasis added).  But courts routinely grant stays in such cases for prudential reasons not listed in sections 10 and 11.  E.g., Middleby, 962 F.2d at 615-16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, this court has held that district courts have discretion to stay an action to compel arbitration pending the outcome of related litigation, even though the Act states that on a motion to compel the court \"shall hear the parties\" and \"shall proceed summarily to trial.\"  9 U.S.C. Sec. 4;  see Acton Corp. v. Borden, Inc., 670 F.2d 377, 383 (1st Cir.1982).  In Acton, then-Judge Breyer held that, in drafting the statute, Congress did not \"intend[ ] a major departure from the ordinary rule allowing one federal court to stay litigation when another federal court is on the process of deciding the same issue.\"   We take the same view of Congress' intentions in implementing the Convention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, a stay of confirmation should not be lightly granted.  A central purpose of the Convention--an international agreement to which the United States is only one of approximately one hundred signatories--was to expedite the recognition of foreign arbitral awards with a minimum of judicial interference.  But the risk that the power to stay could be abused by disgruntled litigants--real though that risk is, see Spier v. Calzaturificio, 663 F.Supp. 871, 875 (S.D.N.Y.1987)--argues more for a cautious and prudent exercise of the power than for its elimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the district court acted under a misapprehension of its authority, we vacate the confirmation order and remand for further proceedings.  Whether confirmation or collection of the award should be partially deferred pending the resolution of the 1982 contract arbitration is a matter for the district court to determine in the first instance.  Still, we think it would require some explanation if, in the face of the equities of this case, the district court concluded that the full award should be confirmed and collected now.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The confirmation order is vacated and the matter is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

The case presents several difficult legal issues which can be understood only after a brief description of the facts and prior proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1982, Apollo Computer, now owned by Hewlett-Packard, entered into a two-year distributorship contract with a Swedish company called Dicoscan Distributed Computer Scandinavia to sell Hewlett-Packard products in several Nordic countries.  The 1982 contract included an agreement to submit any dispute under the contract to binding arbitration.  In March 1984, the parties executed a new distributorship contract, which also contained an arbitration clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the meantime, during 1983 and 1984, Dicoscan experienced financial problems.  In mid-1984, Apollo claimed that Dicoscan was far behind in its payments.  In September, Apollo terminated the 1984 agreement.  The following month, Dicoscan filed for bankruptcy.  The bankruptcy court assigned to Berg and Skoog, directors and officers of Dicoscan, the right to bring claims against Apollo based on the contracts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Berg and Skoog filed a request for arbitration with the International Chamber of Commerce Court of Arbitration, claiming millions of dollars of damages arising out of Apollo's unilateral termination of the 1984 agreement.  Apollo counterclaimed in the arbitration by asserting that the Swedish company had failed to pay about $10,000 due on the 1984 contract and about $207,000 due under the 1982 contract.  After a dispute about Berg and Skoog's right to invoke arbitration, see Apollo Computer, Inc. v. Berg, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529938\"><a href=\"/opinion/529938/apollo-computer-inc-v-helge-berg/\"><span class=\"volume\">886</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span>, 473 (1st Cir.1989), an arbitration proceeding was begun.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The arbitrators were required by the parties' contracts to apply Massachusetts law.  Ultimately, the arbitrators awarded around $700,000 plus interest to Berg and Skoog, but allowed a set-off for the $10,000 that Dicoscan still owed Apollo under the 1984 contract.  To both parties' surprise, the tribunal held that it was without jurisdiction to decide Apollo's more substantial claim based on the 1982 contract, ruling that the 1982 contract was not within the Terms of Reference issued by the arbitrators at the beginning of the proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result, Apollo was left with a sizable obligation to Berg and Skoog on the 1984 contract without a determination of its claim for more than $207,000 on the 1982 contract.  Apollo unilaterally decided to pay the arbitration award amount but subtracted the $207,000 plus interest (together, about $300,000) as a \"setoff in recoupment,\" which, it said, is a time-honored common law doctrine embraced in Massachusetts courts.  Apollo also filed a request with the tribunal for a second arbitration regarding the 1982 contract.  That tribunal has indicated that it will hear the arbitration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1993, Apollo (later succeeded as the plaintiff by Hewlett-Packard) filed the complaint in this action with the Massachusetts district court.  Hewlett-Packard requested that the district court (1) declare that Hewlett-Packard was entitled to the $207,000 set-off and that the arbitration award is fully satisfied, and (2) vacate the tribunal's award and correct it.  Hewlett-Packard later withdrew its second claim for relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Berg and Skoog moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that such declaratory relief is unavailable as to foreign arbitration awards.  Later, Berg and Skoog moved for confirmation of the arbitration award.  Hewlett-Packard opposed confirmation of the award on the ground that, by failing to include its 1982 set-off, the award was contrary to public policy.  In the alternative, Hewlett-Packard moved to stay confirmation, pending the outcome of the second arbitration.  Hewlett-Packard also asked the court to compel arbitration as to its 1982 claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 7, 1994, the district judge filed a memorandum, together with a separate order, disposing of all of these motions.  The court's order compelled arbitration under the 1982 contract but it confirmed the award previously made by the tribunal on the 1984 contract.  The court said that it was without power to stay the confirmation proceeding, as Hewlett-Packard had requested, and that the request for a set-off was an improper attempt to modify the tribunal's award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apparently ready to enforce the now-confirmed arbitration award, Berg and Skoog moved the court for entry of final judgment, and proffered a detailed judgment specifying the award, interest and attorney's fees.  Four days later, Hewlett-Packard filed its notice of appeal and thereafter filed a response disputing certain aspects of the proposed judgment.  The district court has not acted on the motion for entry of final judgment;  and no such judgment has been entered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hewlett-Packard purports to appeal all three of the district court's adverse actions:  the confirmation of the arbitration award, the refusal to stay that confirmation proceeding pending the outcome of the second arbitration;  and the rejection of Hewlett-Packard's set-off claim declaration.  Commendably, Hewlett-Packard has alerted us to a possible jurisdiction problem, which this court is obliged to consider.  We do so but caution future panels that the jurisdictional problems have not been briefed in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the record in this case purports to be a \"final judgment,\" set forth in a separate document as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 58, disposing of all claims.  Thus, in formal terms there is no basis for appeal of a \"final decision\" under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1291, even if the court actually resolved all of the claims before it.  Indeed, as already noted, the defendants have pending a motion that requests entry of a \"final judgment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the November 7 order, insofar as it confirms the arbitration award, is appealable now because Congress directed in the statute governing arbitration-related appeals that such an \"order\" confirming an award should be immediately appealable.  9 U.S.C. Sec. 16(a)(1)(D).  The reason is a pro-arbitration policy designed to expedite confirmation of arbitration awards.  This is clear from precedent and scholarly commentary.  See, e.g., 15B C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 3914.17, at 9-12, 32-34 (2d ed. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is one technical hitch.  Seemingly, the order confirming the award is not itself a judgment that can be collected through court processes until it is entered on the docket as a judgment.  See 9 U.S.C. Sec. 13.  This has nothing to do with the final judgment rule;  rather, the statute that governs confirmations provides that after a confirmation is ordered, a separate \"entry of judgment\" must be made pursuant to that order, and it is only at that stage that \"[t]he judgment so entered ... may be enforced as if it had been rendered in an action in the court in which it is entered.\"   Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not say that appeals can only be taken from judgments;  on the contrary, they contemplate that, subject to the complex rules that determine what is immediately appealable, there may be such a thing as an \"appealable order\" that is not a judgment.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 79(b).  And, as already noted, Congress has designated as immediately appealable \"an order ... confirming ... an [arbitration] award.\"  9 U.S.C. Sec. 16(a)(1)(D).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our position is not at odds with Middleby Corp. v. Hussmann Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"582616\"><a href=\"/opinion/582616/the-middleby-corporation-v-hussmann-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">962</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">614</span></a></span> (7th Cir.1992).  Middleby held that no immediate appeal could be taken where the district court issued an order of confirmation but declined to enter judgment after making a specific determination to delay giving effect to the confirmation order until further proceedings were concluded.  Here, by contrast, the district court denied the requested stay, and the confirmation order is immediately effective, requiring only the filing of specified papers with the clerk to permit \"the entry of judgment thereon.\"  9 U.S.C. Sec. 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the confirmation order is appealable, we think that there is also before us Hewlett-Packard's claim that the confirmation proceeding should have been stayed.  The reason is simply that the underlying argument for a stay is also an objection to the confirmation order itself.  To this extent, it is effectively an interlocutory ruling made in the process of approving the confirmation request and like any other such interlocutory ruling it is reviewable at the time that the confirmation order itself is brought up on appeal.  Cf. Stringfellow v. Concerned Neighbors in Action, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111836\"><a href=\"/opinion/111836/stringfellow-v-concerned-neighbors-in-action/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></a></span>, 375, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111836\"><a href=\"/opinion/111836/stringfellow-v-concerned-neighbors-in-action/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1177</span></a></span>, 1181, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111836\"><a href=\"/opinion/111836/stringfellow-v-concerned-neighbors-in-action/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">389</span></a></span> (1987);  15A Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, supra, Sec. 3905.1, at 249-63.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A similar argument might also be made to justify an appeal now based on the district court's refusal to declare Hewlett-Packard's right to the set-off it asserted. The problem is complicated, but we see no need to resolve the complexities.  Whether or not the refusal to allow the set-off is an appealable issue, the refusal at this time turns out not to be a legal error, so the jurisdictional issue need not be decided.  See Norton v. Mathews, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109524\"><a href=\"/opinion/109524/norton-v-mathews/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">524</span></a></span>, 530-32, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109524\"><a href=\"/opinion/109524/norton-v-mathews/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">672</span></a></span> (1976);  In re Pioneer Ford Sales, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"431994\"><a href=\"/opinion/431994/in-re-pioneer-ford-sales-inc-ford-motor-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">729</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 31 (1st Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to the merits.  Hewlett-Packard does not object to the confirmation of the award in all respects;  it says it has paid the award except the disputed amount including interest.  But Hewlett-Packard says that the district court erred by confirming the award in full instead of either allowing a set-off or granting a stay of the confirmation pending the results of the new arbitration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court's rejection at this time of the first alternative.  Whether Hewlett-Packard has a valid claim under the 1982 contract is subject to arbitration;  we agree with the district court--and Hewlett-Packard--that the tribunal has never resolved the merits of that claim.  Whatever the Massachusetts law on set-offs, the district court could not allow the set-off at present without determining that Hewlett-Packard had a valid claim, which is the very subject of the arbitration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is hard to imagine a step that would be more offensive to the pro-arbitration policies reflected in Congress' endorsement of the 1958 Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, often called the New York Convention.  The New York Convention was approved by Congress, and implementing legislation was codified at 9 U.S.C. Secs. 201-08.  The statute enlists the aid of federal courts to compel arbitration.  9 U.S.C. Sec. 206.  By contrast, the judicial set-off requested here would circumvent the 1982 contract to arbitrate and the now-pending arbitration under that contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The request to defer confirmation of the award under the 1984 contract stands on a different footing.  However the case might stand absent the bankruptcy, Dicoscan's bankruptcy gives Hewlett-Packard a very substantial prudential argument.  If the existing award were confirmed in full and reduced to judgment, Hewlett-Packard would have to pay the full award to the defendants as successors-in-interest of an insolvent company.  If in due course Hewlett-Packard then prevailed on its claims against the insolvent company on a closely related transaction, it would have no assurance of collecting anything.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, Hewlett-Packard cannot be blamed for the discrepant timing in the resolution of its claim, or at least no argument to that effect has been made.  After it was told that the defendants did have arbitration rights despite an anti-assignment clause in the contracts, Hewlett-Packard apparently made a reasonable effort to have both the defendants' claim and its own counterclaim resolved in one proceeding at the same time.  Only the arbitrators' surprising interpretation of their mandate frustrated this attempt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, the seemingly fair solution would be to confirm the award in its uncontested part, reserving confirmation of the balance until the 1982 contract dispute is arbitrated.  The district court refused to consider a stay of confirmation on the ground that it was without power to do so.  We fully understand the basis for the district court's doubt about its authority, but we conclude that it does have the power to issue a stay in the peculiar circumstances of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily there could be no doubt that a court, although obliged to decide a claim, would retain discretion to defer proceedings for prudential reasons.

The statute provides that, upon a petition for confirmation, a district court \"shall confirm the award unless it finds one of the grounds for refusal or deferral of recognition or enforcement of the award specified in the said Convention.\"  9 U.S.C. Sec. 207 (emphasis added).  Article VI of the Convention is the only provision that deals with staying confirmation.  Article VI states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>If an application for the setting aside or suspension of the award has been made to a competent authority [in the country where the award has been made], the authority before which the award is sought to be relied upon may, if it considers it proper, adjourn the decision on the enforcement of the award [and require a security].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circumstances outlined in Article VI do not appear to exist in this case.

That was, in substance, the reasoning of the district court.  However, expressio unius is an aid to construction and not an inflexible rule.  See, e.g., United States v. Massachusetts Bay Transport.  Auth., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"373921\"><a href=\"/opinion/373921/united-states-v-massachusetts-bay-transportation-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">614</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 28 (1st Cir.1980).  Whatever we might think if the question were entirely open, precedent informs our decision in this case.  Domestic arbitrations are governed by the United States Arbitration Act (chapter 1 of Title 9) but not by the Convention (chapter 2 of Title 9).  The Act states that, upon application, \"the court must grant [a confirmation] order unless the award is vacated, modified, or corrected as prescribed in sections 10 and 11 of this title.\"  9 U.S.C. Sec. 9 (emphasis added).  But courts routinely grant stays in such cases for prudential reasons not listed in sections 10 and 11.  E.g., Middleby, 962 F.2d at 615-16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, this court has held that district courts have discretion to stay an action to compel arbitration pending the outcome of related litigation, even though the Act states that on a motion to compel the court \"shall hear the parties\" and \"shall proceed summarily to trial.\"  9 U.S.C. Sec. 4;  see Acton Corp. v. Borden, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"399276\"><a href=\"/opinion/399276/acton-corporation-v-borden-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">670</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">377</span></a></span>, 383 (1st Cir.1982).  In Acton, then-Judge Breyer held that, in drafting the statute, Congress did not \"intend[ ] a major departure from the ordinary rule allowing one federal court to stay litigation when another federal court is on the process of deciding the same issue.\"   We take the same view of Congress' intentions in implementing the Convention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, a stay of confirmation should not be lightly granted.  A central purpose of the Convention--an international agreement to which the United States is only one of approximately one hundred signatories--was to expedite the recognition of foreign arbitral awards with a minimum of judicial interference.  But the risk that the power to stay could be abused by disgruntled litigants--real though that risk is, see Spier v. Calzaturificio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1413739\"><a href=\"/opinion/1413739/spier-v-calzaturificio-tecnica-spa/\"><span class=\"volume\">663</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">871</span></a></span>, 875 (S.D.N.Y.1987)--argues more for a cautious and prudent exercise of the power than for its elimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the district court acted under a misapprehension of its authority, we vacate the confirmation order and remand for further proceedings.  Whether confirmation or collection of the award should be partially deferred pending the resolution of the 1982 contract arbitration is a matter for the district court to determine in the first instance.  Still, we think it would require some explanation if, in the face of the equities of this case, the district court concluded that the full award should be confirmed and collected now.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The confirmation order is vacated and the matter is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
