HOLMY,\n\n                      Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                v.\n\n                     DURACELL, INC., ET AL.,\n\n                      Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n          [Hon. A. David Mazzone, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                        Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n                   Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n\n     Kurt E. Holmy on brief pro se.\n     Richard P. Ward, Anthony D. Rizzotti and Ropes & Gray on brief\nfor appellees.\n\n\n\n                          March 19, 2002\n\f            Per Curiam.   Kurt E. Holmy appeals from the district\n\ncourt's decision granting summary judgment in favor of the\n\ndefendants in Holmy's complaint alleging retaliatory discharge,\n\ninterference with business advantage, and defamation.           We have\n\nreviewed the record, the parties' briefs, and the applicable\n\nlaw, and, as to Holmy's first two claims, we AFFIRM for\n\nessentially the same reasons set forth in the district court's\n\nmemorandum order granting summary judgment.            See Holmy v.\n\nDuracell, Inc. et al., No. 97-11173-MLW (D. Mass. Sep. 28,\n\n2000).   Holmy's defamation claim fails because, among other\nthings, he does not establish the necessary \"special harm\"\n\nresulting    from   the   alleged    defamatory   statements.      See\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts ยง 575 cmt. b (1977) (defining\n\"special harm\" as \"the loss of something having economic or\n\npecuniary value,\" not a mere loss of reputation or social\nstanding).   Nor does he establish that the statements at issue\nwere defamatory per se.        Id. at ยง 570.        Accordingly, no\n\nreasonable factfinder could find the complainant liable for\ndefamation, and summary judgment was thus proper on this basis.\n            AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f",
