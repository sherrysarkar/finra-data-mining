Hyman makes a number of arguments  as to why\r\n\nthe district  court  erred in  allowing  recovery.   In  this\r\n\nopinion we  concentrate particularly on  Hyman's contentions:\r\n\n(1) that Water  Works did  not satisfy  the Act's  ninety-day\r\n\nnotice requirement; and  (2) that Water Works did  not have a\r\n\nsufficiently  close  relationship  to  Hyman  to  qualify for\r\n\nrecovery under the Miller Act.  Finding no merit in these  or\r\n\nin the other arguments that Hyman advances, we affirm.\r\n\n                       I.  BACKGROUND.\r\n\n          The  facts are largely  undisputed.  Hyman  was the\r\n\ngeneral contractor  on  a $70  million  federal  construction\r\n\nproject  to  build  a  mail  processing  center  in  Waltham,\r\n\nMassachusetts (the \"Post  Office Project\" or  the \"Project\").\r\n\nPursuant  to  the  requirements  of  the  Miller  Act,  Hyman\r\n\nobtained  a payment bond  from National Union  Fire Insurance\r\n\nCompany  of Pittsburgh,  PA, Federal  Insurance Company,  and\r\n\nSeaboard Surety Company  (collectively, the \"Sureties\").   On\r\n\nor  about  September 16,  1994,  Hyman entered  into  an oral\r\n\nagreement with Calvesco,  Inc. (\"Calvesco\"), wherein Calvesco\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\npromised to  serve as  demolition, excavation  and site  work\r\n\nsubcontractor for the Post Office Project.\r\n\n          On  September 16,  1994, the  same  day that  Hyman\r\n\nhired Calvesco, Calvesco submitted an application for  credit\r\n\nto  Water Works,  a  purveyor of  pipe and  piping materials.\r\n\nWater Works extended an unlimited line of credit to Calvesco.\r\n\nCalvesco was working on at least three projects at that time,\r\n\nand the  credit application did  not indicate whether  it was\r\n\nfor a particular project.\r\n\n          Subsequently, Calvesco informed Hyman that it could\r\n\nnot legally serve as subcontractor on the Post Office Project\r\n\nbecause  it was  a non-union  shop.   On September  27, 1994,\r\n\nHyman  and  Calvesco  agreed to  replace  Calvesco  with Iron\r\n\nHoldings,  Inc. d/b/a Charles  A. Jackson Co.  (\"Jackson\"), a\r\n\nunionized company created by the principals of Calvesco. \r\n\n          On October 11,  1994, Jackson notified Water  Works\r\n\nthat it  had replaced Calvesco  as subcontractor on  the Post\r\n\nOffice  Project.    Jackson requested  that  it,  rather than\r\n\nCalvesco,  receive  Water Works's  invoices.   Because  Water\r\n\nWorks  had  extended  credit  only to  Calvesco  and  not  to\r\n\nJackson,  Water  Works  refused   to  supply  Jackson  unless\r\n\nCalvesco executed a corporate guarantee.  Until the corporate\r\n\nguarantee could be signed, Water Works agreed to  ship piping\r\n\nmaterials  to the  Post  Office  Project  site  at  Jackson's\r\n\nrequest and to send the invoices to Calvesco.  That same day,\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nJackson placed  an order for  pipe.  Water Works  shipped the\r\n\nmaterial to  \"Charles A. Jackson  Co., c/o Calvesco.\"   Water\r\n\nWorks  sent  the  invoice to  \"Calvesco,  Inc.  Attn: Jackson\r\n\nGateman, Treas.\" (\"Gateman\").\r\n\n          From early October through December 29, 1994, Water\r\n\nWorks  filled  seven  purchase orders  relating  to  the Post\r\n\nOffice Project.  Water Works  continued to ship materials  to\r\n\nthe  Post Office  Project site  and to  send the  invoices to\r\n\nGateman  at Calvesco.   Jackson  paid for  five of  the seven\r\n\nshipments; the other  two invoices remain unpaid and  are the\r\n\nsubject  of  this action.    The  first unpaid  invoice,  for\r\n\n$53,493.83  and dated November  30, 1994, corresponded  to an\r\n\norder placed on  November 1, 1994 by Lou  Ingegneri, the Post\r\n\nOffice  Project manager  for  Jackson.    The  second  unpaid\r\n\ninvoice,  for $157.76 and dated  January 12, 1995, related to\r\n\nthe last delivery  made by Water Works to  the Project, which\r\n\noccurred on December 29, 1994.   This second invoice does not\r\n\nindicate the name of the person placing the order.\r\n\n          During  January and February of 1995, Water Works's\r\n\ncredit manager Stanley Wernick  (\"Wernick\") conversed on  the\r\n\ntelephone  with   several  employees   of  Hyman   about  the\r\n\noutstanding  November and  December invoices.    On March  7,\r\n\nWernick sent a demand letter  to Calvesco.  Wernick also sent\r\n\na  copy of  this letter  to Hyman  and the  Sureties.   Hyman\r\n\nresponded  to Wernick's communications in writing on March 22\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nby  indicating that  it had  turned  the matter  over to  its\r\n\nattorneys and was not  paying any claims until it had a clear\r\n\npicture of its options.\r\n\n          On  April  5,  1995,  Water  Works  filed  suit  in\r\n\nMiddlesex  County  Superior Court  against  Calvesco and  its\r\n\npersonal guarantor for monies owed on several jobs, including\r\n\nthe Post Office Project.  This state court suit resulted in a\r\n\nsettlement in  which Calvesco agreed  to pay Water  Works for\r\n\nthe cost of  its materials.  Calvesco has  not satisfied this\r\n\njudgment.\r\n\n          On the  same day that  Water Works filed  its state\r\n\naction,  it also  filed  a  one-count  Miller  Act  complaint\r\n\nagainst Hyman and the Sureties  in the United States District\r\n\nCourt for the District of Massachusetts.  The  district court\r\n\nconsolidated Water  Works's federal  action with  twenty-five\r\n\nother actions  brought against  Hyman arising  from the  Post\r\n\nOffice Project in  order to determine issues of  fact and law\r\n\ncommon to all  the claimants.  The district  court found that\r\n\nCalvesco  and Jackson  were separate corporate  entities, and\r\n\nthat Calvesco  was Hyman's  subcontractor from September  16,\r\n\n1994  through September  27, 1994,  with  Jackson serving  as\r\n\nsubcontractor thereafter.\r\n\n          Water  Works argued to  the district court  that it\r\n\nwas in a direct contractual relationship with Calvesco during\r\n\nthe  period  of   time  when  Calvesco  was   Hyman's  direct\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nsubcontractor.   The district  court rejected  this argument,\r\n\nfinding that the  credit application between Water  Works and\r\n\nCalvesco did not constitute a contract.\r\n\n          Nevertheless, the court held that Water Works could\r\n\nrecover under the  Miller Act.  Finding that  Water Works had\r\n\nsatisfied  the 90-day notice  requirement in the  Miller Act,\r\n\nthe  court  held  that  Water Works  could  recover  from the\r\n\npayment bond on the amount  owed for its November order under\r\n\ntwo alternative theories.  First, Jackson had an open account\r\n\nwith  Water Works.   Second, Water Works  could recover under\r\n\nthe doctrine of quantum meruit.\r\n\n          The district court  allowed Water Works  to recover\r\n\nthe amount of its November shipment -- $53,493.83, plus costs\r\n\nand interest -- but not the amount of its December shipment -\r\n\n- $157.76.   The key  distinction between the two  orders, in\r\n\nthe court's view,  was that the November order  was signed by\r\n\nJackson's project manager, whereas the December  order, being\r\n\nunsigned, could not be plainly attributed to Jackson.\r\n\n                   II.

DISCUSSION.\r\n\n     A.   The Statutory Scheme of the Miller Act.\r                                                            \r\n\n          The  Miller  Act  requires  a  general   contractor\r\n\nperforming a contract  valued at over  $25,000 on any  public\r\n\nconstruction project  to obtain  a performance  bond for  the\r\n\nprotection of  persons supplying  labor and  material in  the\r\n\nprosecution  of the  work on  the project.   See 40  U.S.C.  \r                                                            \r\n\n270a(a)(2).    The   Act  provides  that  persons   who  have\r\n\n\"furnished labor or material\" to  a public project may sue to\r\n\nrecover from the payment bond  any amount owed to them.   Id.\r                                                                         \r\n\n  270b(a).\r\n\n          The  purpose of  the  Miller  Act  is  \"to  protect\r\n\npersons  supplying labor and material for the construction of\r\n\nfederal public buildings in lieu of the protection they might\r\n\nreceive under state statutes with respect to the construction\r\n\nof nonfederal buildings.\"   United States ex  rel.

Courts give the  Act a\r\n\nliberal interpretation to  achieve that purpose.   See, e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nCarter, 353  U.S. at 216;  Clifford F. MacEvoy Co.  v.

First, the Miller\r\n\nAct  allows recovery  from the  bond  by persons  who have  a\r\n\n\"direct  contractual relationship\"  with  either the  general\r\n\ncontractor  or  a  first-tier  subcontractor  of  the general\r\n\ncontractor.   40 U.S.C.    270b(a).   The  Supreme Court  has\r\n\ninterpreted  this  provision  to  preclude  recovery  on  the\r\n\npayment  bond by  anyone whose  relationship  to the  general\r\n\ncontractor is  more remote than a  second-tier subcontractor.\r\n\nSee J.W. Bateson Co. v. United States ex rel. Bd. of Trustees\r                                                                         \r\n\nof the  Nat'l Automatic  Sprinkler Indus.

In  order to  recover from  the payment\r\n\nbond, such suppliers must send written notice of  their claim\r\n\non  the payment bond to  the general contractor within ninety\r\n\ndays from the date that they supply the last of the materials\r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\nfor which they  make a claim.  40  U.S.C.   270b(a); see also\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited  States  ex  rel.

Hyman points to court  decisions holding\r\n\nthat the mere forwarding to  the general contractor of a copy\r\n\nof  a demand  sent to  a subcontractor  does not  satisfy the\r\n\nMiller  Act's notice  requirement.   See Maccaferri  Gabions,\r                                                                         \r\n\nInc. v.

See Altech, 929 F.2d at\r                                                            \r\n\n1093; Coffee, 157 F.2d at 970; Kinlau, 537 F.2d at 223.\r                                                 \r\n\n          The record  here shows  not only  that Water  Works\r\n\nsent Hyman  the amount  and details  of Water  Works's claims\r\n\nagainst the subcontractor, but that these were accompanied by\r\n\nfurther  oral and written  communications that could  only be\r\n\nperceived, and  were in fact  perceived, as looking  to Hyman\r\n\nitself for payment.   Water Works's credit  manager, Wernick,\r\n\ninitiated  matters on February  3, 1995,  by speaking  on the\r\n\ntelephone with two Hyman employees who were handling the Post\r\n\nOffice Project account.   During the course of  several calls\r\n\non that day,  Wernick informed them that Water  Works had not\r\n\nbeen paid  by the subcontractor  for its materials.   Wernick\r\n\nthereupon faxed copies  of Water Works's unpaid  invoices and\r\n\nproofs  of delivery  to Hyman,  thus informing  Hyman of  the\r\n\namount  Water  Works  claimed from  the  subcontractor.   The\r\n\ndistrict court found that, in these calls, Wernick also asked\r\n\nto obtain  a copy  of Hyman's payment  bond for  \"the express\r\n\n                             -12-\r\r\n\npurpose of filing  a bond claim.\"  Hyman's  personnel refused\r\n\nto release  the requested  bonding information,  but, as  the\r\n\ndistrict  court found,  they countered  with  a promise  that\r\n\nHyman would issue  joint checks payable to  Jackson and Water\r\n\nWorks,  a  device   to  ensure  payment  for   Water  Works's\r\n\nmaterials.  Wernick continued to communicate about the unpaid\r\n\nclaims with  Hyman  throughout the  month  of February.    On\r\n\nFebruary  9,  Wernick   spoke  again  with  the   same  Hyman\r\n\nemployees, who informed him that they were attempting to meet\r\n\nwith the  subcontractor to  discuss the issue  of the  unpaid\r\n\ninvoices.  Finally on March  7, after more phone calls, Water\r\n\nWorks sent to Hyman a copy of  a demand letter it had written\r\n\nto Calvesco.2  The copy reflected at the bottom not only that\r\n\na copy  had gone to  Hyman but that  copies had been  sent to\r\n\nHyman's three  Miller Act  Sureties.   Finally, on March  22,\r\n\n1995, Hyman wrote Water Works  thanking it for its  patience,\r\n\nindicating that it  had already paid Jackson,  expressing its\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Hyman argues that \"the facts of the present case are even\r\nmore persuasive  than Maccaferri or  Kinlau since Water Works\r                                                       \r\npurported demand  letter  .  .  .  was  not made  to  Hyman's\r                                                       \r\nsubcontractor Jackson, but rather to Calvesco.\"  However, the\r\nnames  \"Calvesco\"  and  \"Jackson\"  seem  to  have  been  used\r\ninterchangeably on various occasions, and there is absolutely\r\nno evidence that Hyman was  confused over the identity of the\r\nsubcontractor  identified  by  Water  Works.    Calvesco  and\r\nJackson were owned in  common and Hyman had  been a party  to\r\nthe  agreement  that  substituted  Jackson  for  Calvesco  as\r\nsubcontractor for the  Project.  While Hyman  personnel, like\r\nWater  Works,  sometimes  referred  to \"Calvesco,\"  the  name\r\n\"Jackson\" was correctly used by  Hyman in its March 22 letter\r\nto Water Works declining to pay its claim, showing that Hyman\r\nwas fully aware of thecorrect identity of the subcontractor. \r\n\n                             -13-\r\r\n\nreluctance  to pay the  same bill twice,  and informing Water\r\n\nWorks  that it  had \"turned  the  entire matter  over to  our\r\n\nattorneys and, on  their advi[c]e, we  are not paying  anyone\r\n\nuntil we have a clear picture of our options.\"\r\n\n          The above  evidence provides clear  indication that\r\n\nHyman  understood  that Water  Works  was looking  to  it for\r\n\npayment, having received, as the district court found \"actual\r\n\nnotice.\"  Wernick's  initial request for a copy  of the bond,\r\n\nfollowing his faxing of the unpaid invoices and his telephone\r\n\ncalls to Hyman about the debt, suggested that Water Works was\r\n\nlooking to it for payment.  Hyman's comprehension of this can\r\n\nbe  inferred from  Hyman's promise to  issue joint  checks in\r\n\nsubstitute for information  about the bond.  But  we need not\r\n\ndecide  whether  these  actions  by  themselves  sufficed  to\r\n\nconstitute  notice.   Following  these  and other  exchanges,\r\n\nWater Works  sent Hyman on  March 7  a copy of  Water Works's\r\n\ndemand   upon  the  subcontractor.     Unlike  the   copy  in\r\n\nMaccaferri, this  indicated at  the bottom  that copies  were\r                      \r\n\nalso being sent  to Hyman's three Sureties on  the Miller Act\r\n\nbond, each of which was designated  by name.  It is not  easy\r\n\nto  think of  a reason  to notify  the Sureties  unless Water\r\n\nWorks was looking to the bond for payment.\r\n\n          In  Maccaferri,  the  Eleventh  Circuit  held  that\r                                    \r\n\nmerely sending the general contractor a copy of the demand to\r\n\nthe subcontractor did not suffice  to show that the  supplier\r\n\n                             -14-\r\r\n\nwas looking for  payment to the general, but  the surrounding\r\n\ncircumstances  were  far  less  indicative that  payment  was\r\n\nsought, and there  was no indication  that the Sureties  were\r\n\nbeing sent  copies.  Here,  upon receipt of  a copy of  Water\r\n\nWorks's  demand upon  the subcontractor showing  plainly that\r\n\nother  copies had been sent  to Hyman's Sureties, Hyman could\r\n\nhave had no illusion that it was not being asked to pay.\r\n\n          Hyman's letter of March 22, 1995 fully confirms our\r\n\ninterpretation.   In the  letter, Hyman  thanked Water  Works\r\n\n\"for being so patient with us while we are trying to sort out\r\n\nthe problems\"  relative to  the Jackson  claims.   The letter\r\n\nwent  on to  speak  of  Hyman's  difficulties  with  Jackson,\r\n\nHyman's strong  reluctance to  pay the  same bill  twice, and\r\n\nthat it had  \"turned the entire matter over  to our attorneys\r\n\nand,  on their advice, we are not paying anyone until we have\r                                                           \r\n\na clear  picture of our  options\" (emphasis added).   \"In the\r\n\nend,\"  the  letter  went  on,  \"we  may,  in  fact,  be  held\r\n\nresponsible for paying these  invoices.  But we  will exhaust\r\n\nevery legal  remedy  before  we  do.\"    The  district  court\r\n\ninferred, and we  entirely agree, that this  letter must have\r\n\nbeen in  response to  what Hyman believed  was a  request for\r\n\npayment  by  Water Works.    See  Altech,  929 F.2d  at  1093\r                                                    \r\n\n(general  contractor's  letter held  to  provide  evidence of\r\n\nnotice).  \r\n\n                             -15-\r\r\n\n          We, therefore,  agree with the district  court that\r\n\nin this period  Hyman received notice sufficient  to meet the\r\n\nrequirements of the Miller Act.\r\n\n     2.   Timing of Water Works's Notice.\r                                                    \r\n\n          The district court found that the ninety-day period\r\n\nbegan  to run on December 29,  1994, the day that Water Works\r\n\nmade its  final  delivery of  materials  to the  Post  Office\r\n\nProject.   Thus, by  the court's calculations,  Water Works's\r\n\nletter of March  7, 1995, a copy  of which was sent  to Hyman\r\n\nand the Sureties,  and which in combination with  the earlier\r\n\ninvoices constituted the  written portion of the  notice, fit\r\n\nwithin the ninety-day limit.\r\n\n          In support of  its assertion that the  court should\r\n\nhave used the  date of the November order,  November 1, 1994,\r\n\nrather  than the date of  the December order when calculating\r\n\nthe ninety-day  time limit,  Hyman suggests  that each  order\r\n\nunder an  open account represents a separate contract with an\r\n\nindividual  ninety-day  limit.

Where\r                                                                \r\n\nclaims are based  on an open  account theory, the  ninety-day\r\n\nnotice period for all of the deliveries begins on the date of\r\n\nthe last delivery to the project.  The parties to this action\r\n\nagree that Water Works delivered the last of its materials to\r\n\nthe Post Office  Project on December 29, 1994.   We therefore\r\n\n                             -17-\r\r\n\nconclude  that the district  court correctly refused  to deny\r\n\nrecovery on the November order  merely because it was part of\r\n\nan open account.\r\n\n          Hyman also  argues that, since  the district  court\r\n\ndenied  recovery to  Water  Works for  the December  order of\r\n\n$157.76,  it should not have used  the date of that order for\r\n\npurposes of calculating the timeliness of notice.  We are not\r\n\npersuaded.\r\n\n          As  an initial  matter, we  note  that the  statute\r\n\nstates that  the time  limit runs from  the date of  the last\r\n\ndelivery of material \"for which a claim  is made.\"  40 U.S.C.\r\n\n  270b(a).  The statute does not  start the time limit on the\r\n\nlast  claim for which the plaintiff eventually recovers; such\r\n\na provision might prove unworkable.\r\n\n          But   even  if  the  statute  runs  from  the  last\r\n\nrecoverable claim, we see little  problem.  In denying  Water\r\n\nWorks  recovery on  the December  order,  the district  court\r\n\nwrote a footnote explaining its reasoning for  distinguishing\r\n\nbetween  the November and December orders: the November order\r\n\nform contained the name of a Jackson employee while there was\r\n\nno name on the December  order.  The district court concluded\r\n\nthat there was \"no evidence as to whether Calvesco or Jackson\r\n\nplaced the [December] order.\"  Accordingly, the court limited\r\n\nWater Works's recovery  to the amount  of the November  order\r\n\n($53,493.83) plus costs and interest.\r\n\n                             -18-\r\r\n\n          The  undisputed facts are as follows.  First, Water\r\n\nWorks provided materials that were incorporated into the Post\r\n\nOffice Project.   Second, Water Works did  not begin shipping\r\n\nthese materials until after Jackson became the  subcontractor\r\n\non the  Project.  Third,  although Water Works  insisted upon\r\n\nsending its invoices  to Calvesco, Jackson paid for the first\r\n\nfive shipments  by Water Works.   Fourth, Calvesco was  not a\r\n\nsubcontractor on the Project during the time that Water Works\r\n\nshipped materials to the Project.   Fifth, the last date that\r\n\nWater Works delivered  materials to the Project  was December\r\n\n29, 1994.\r\n\n          On these facts,  we see no reason for  the court to\r\n\nhave  questioned if Calvesco  rather than Jackson  placed the\r\n\nDecember order.  Calvesco, having been replaced by Jackson as\r\n\nthe  subcontractor on the Post  Office Project, had no reason\r\n\nto  order  materials  for  this  job.   The  only  reasonable\r\n\ninference  is  that  Jackson placed  this  order,  as  it did\r\n\nearlier ones.   While in the  absence of a  cross appeal, the\r\n\ncourt's denial  of the  $157.76 stands, we  see no  reason to\r\n\nreject the court's  determination that the December  29, 1994\r\n\ndate triggered the notice period.\r\n\n          As  the notice  was adequate  and  as the  district\r\n\ncourt  did  not  err  in  beginning  the  notice period  from\r\n\nDecember   29,  1994,  Water   Works  satisfied   the  notice\r\n\nrequirements of the Miller Act.\r\n\n                             -19-\r\r\n\n     C.   Water Works's Relationship to Hyman.\r                                                         \r\n\n          In order to recover from the payment bond, a person\r\n\nmust have a \"direct contractual relationship\" either with the\r\n\ngeneral contractor or with a direct subcontractor.  40 U.S.C.\r\n\n  270b(a); see  also Bateson, 434 U.S. at 590-91.   Hyman and\r                                        \r\n\nWater  Works  agree  that they  had  no  direct relationship.\r\n\nHyman argues further  that Water Works did not  have a direct\r\n\ncontractual relationship with any of Hyman's  subcontractors.\r\n\nHyman  relies upon  the  undisputed  fact  that  Water  Works\r\n\nconsistently refused to extend credit to Jackson and regarded\r\n\nCalvesco as its customer.\r\n\n          As  the district court correctly noted, courts have\r\n\nallowed  recovery under  the  Miller  Act  by  suppliers  who\r\n\nfurnish materials  to a subcontractor  \"from time to  time on\r\n\nopen account  . .  . without formal  contract.\"   Noland, 273\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d at  919; see also  Apache Powder Co. v. Ashton  Co., 264\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d  417, 422-23  (9th Cir.  1959).   It is  undisputed that\r\n\nWater  Works supplied  materials  to  the  Project  and  that\r\n\nJackson  was  the   demolition,  excavation  and   site  work\r\n\nsubcontractor  on the Post Office Project after September 27,\r\n\n1994.  In addition, Jackson, rather than Calvesco, paid Water\r\n\nWorks's  first five invoices.  This evidence clearly supports\r\n\nthe  district court's  finding  of the  existence of  an open\r\n\naccount  between Jackson and Water  Works.  Since Jackson was\r\n\n                             -20-\r\r\n\nHyman's direct subcontractor,  the Act's tiering requirements\r\n\nare satisfied.\r\n\n          Since we  find  that the  district court  correctly\r\n\nallowed Water Works to recover  under an open account theory,\r\n\nwe need not address the propriety of its alternative holding,\r\n\nwhich allowed recovery on the basis of quantum meruit.\r\n\n          We   have   carefully  considered   Hyman's   other\r\n\narguments; none of them  persuade us that the district  court\r\n\nerred in its determination.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                             -21-\r\r\n",

Hyman makes a number of arguments  as to why\r\n\nthe district  court  erred in  allowing  recovery.   In  this\r\n\nopinion we  concentrate particularly on  Hyman's contentions:\r\n\n(1) that Water  Works did  not satisfy  the Act's  ninety-day\r\n\nnotice requirement; and  (2) that Water Works did  not have a\r\n\nsufficiently  close  relationship  to  Hyman  to  qualify for\r\n\nrecovery under the Miller Act.  Finding no merit in these  or\r\n\nin the other arguments that Hyman advances, we affirm.\r\n\n                       I.  BACKGROUND.\r\n\n          The  facts are largely  undisputed.  Hyman  was the\r\n\ngeneral contractor  on  a $70  million  federal  construction\r\n\nproject  to  build  a  mail  processing  center  in  Waltham,\r\n\nMassachusetts (the \"Post  Office Project\" or  the \"Project\").\r\n\nPursuant  to  the  requirements  of  the  Miller  Act,  Hyman\r\n\nobtained  a payment bond  from National Union  Fire Insurance\r\n\nCompany  of Pittsburgh,  PA, Federal  Insurance Company,  and\r\n\nSeaboard Surety Company  (collectively, the \"Sureties\").   On\r\n\nor  about  September 16,  1994,  Hyman entered  into  an oral\r\n\nagreement with Calvesco,  Inc. (\"Calvesco\"), wherein Calvesco\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\npromised to  serve as  demolition, excavation  and site  work\r\n\nsubcontractor for the Post Office Project.\r\n\n          On  September 16,  1994, the  same  day that  Hyman\r\n\nhired Calvesco, Calvesco submitted an application for  credit\r\n\nto  Water Works,  a  purveyor of  pipe and  piping materials.\r\n\nWater Works extended an unlimited line of credit to Calvesco.\r\n\nCalvesco was working on at least three projects at that time,\r\n\nand the  credit application did  not indicate whether  it was\r\n\nfor a particular project.\r\n\n          Subsequently, Calvesco informed Hyman that it could\r\n\nnot legally serve as subcontractor on the Post Office Project\r\n\nbecause  it was  a non-union  shop.   On September  27, 1994,\r\n\nHyman  and  Calvesco  agreed to  replace  Calvesco  with Iron\r\n\nHoldings,  Inc. d/b/a Charles  A. Jackson Co.  (\"Jackson\"), a\r\n\nunionized company created by the principals of Calvesco. \r\n\n          On October 11,  1994, Jackson notified Water  Works\r\n\nthat it  had replaced Calvesco  as subcontractor on  the Post\r\n\nOffice  Project.    Jackson requested  that  it,  rather than\r\n\nCalvesco,  receive  Water Works's  invoices.   Because  Water\r\n\nWorks  had  extended  credit  only to  Calvesco  and  not  to\r\n\nJackson,  Water  Works  refused   to  supply  Jackson  unless\r\n\nCalvesco executed a corporate guarantee.  Until the corporate\r\n\nguarantee could be signed, Water Works agreed to  ship piping\r\n\nmaterials  to the  Post  Office  Project  site  at  Jackson's\r\n\nrequest and to send the invoices to Calvesco.  That same day,\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nJackson placed  an order for  pipe.  Water Works  shipped the\r\n\nmaterial to  \"Charles A. Jackson  Co., c/o Calvesco.\"   Water\r\n\nWorks  sent  the  invoice to  \"Calvesco,  Inc.  Attn: Jackson\r\n\nGateman, Treas.\" (\"Gateman\").\r\n\n          From early October through December 29, 1994, Water\r\n\nWorks  filled  seven  purchase orders  relating  to  the Post\r\n\nOffice Project.  Water Works  continued to ship materials  to\r\n\nthe  Post Office  Project site  and to  send the  invoices to\r\n\nGateman  at Calvesco.   Jackson  paid for  five of  the seven\r\n\nshipments; the other  two invoices remain unpaid and  are the\r\n\nsubject  of  this action.    The  first unpaid  invoice,  for\r\n\n$53,493.83  and dated November  30, 1994, corresponded  to an\r\n\norder placed on  November 1, 1994 by Lou  Ingegneri, the Post\r\n\nOffice  Project manager  for  Jackson.    The  second  unpaid\r\n\ninvoice,  for $157.76 and dated  January 12, 1995, related to\r\n\nthe last delivery  made by Water Works to  the Project, which\r\n\noccurred on December 29, 1994.   This second invoice does not\r\n\nindicate the name of the person placing the order.\r\n\n          During  January and February of 1995, Water Works's\r\n\ncredit manager Stanley Wernick  (\"Wernick\") conversed on  the\r\n\ntelephone  with   several  employees   of  Hyman   about  the\r\n\noutstanding  November and  December invoices.    On March  7,\r\n\nWernick sent a demand letter  to Calvesco.  Wernick also sent\r\n\na  copy of  this letter  to Hyman  and the  Sureties.   Hyman\r\n\nresponded  to Wernick's communications in writing on March 22\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nby  indicating that  it had  turned  the matter  over to  its\r\n\nattorneys and was not  paying any claims until it had a clear\r\n\npicture of its options.\r\n\n          On  April  5,  1995,  Water  Works  filed  suit  in\r\n\nMiddlesex  County  Superior Court  against  Calvesco and  its\r\n\npersonal guarantor for monies owed on several jobs, including\r\n\nthe Post Office Project.  This state court suit resulted in a\r\n\nsettlement in  which Calvesco agreed  to pay Water  Works for\r\n\nthe cost of  its materials.  Calvesco has  not satisfied this\r\n\njudgment.\r\n\n          On the  same day that  Water Works filed  its state\r\n\naction,  it also  filed  a  one-count  Miller  Act  complaint\r\n\nagainst Hyman and the Sureties  in the United States District\r\n\nCourt for the District of Massachusetts.  The  district court\r\n\nconsolidated Water  Works's federal  action with  twenty-five\r\n\nother actions  brought against  Hyman arising  from the  Post\r\n\nOffice Project in  order to determine issues of  fact and law\r\n\ncommon to all  the claimants.  The district  court found that\r\n\nCalvesco  and Jackson  were separate corporate  entities, and\r\n\nthat Calvesco  was Hyman's  subcontractor from September  16,\r\n\n1994  through September  27, 1994,  with  Jackson serving  as\r\n\nsubcontractor thereafter.\r\n\n          Water  Works argued to  the district court  that it\r\n\nwas in a direct contractual relationship with Calvesco during\r\n\nthe  period  of   time  when  Calvesco  was   Hyman's  direct\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nsubcontractor.   The district  court rejected  this argument,\r\n\nfinding that the  credit application between Water  Works and\r\n\nCalvesco did not constitute a contract.\r\n\n          Nevertheless, the court held that Water Works could\r\n\nrecover under the  Miller Act.  Finding that  Water Works had\r\n\nsatisfied  the 90-day notice  requirement in the  Miller Act,\r\n\nthe  court  held  that  Water Works  could  recover  from the\r\n\npayment bond on the amount  owed for its November order under\r\n\ntwo alternative theories.  First, Jackson had an open account\r\n\nwith  Water Works.   Second, Water Works  could recover under\r\n\nthe doctrine of quantum meruit.\r\n\n          The district court  allowed Water Works  to recover\r\n\nthe amount of its November shipment -- $53,493.83, plus costs\r\n\nand interest -- but not the amount of its December shipment -\r\n\n- $157.76.   The key  distinction between the two  orders, in\r\n\nthe court's view,  was that the November order  was signed by\r\n\nJackson's project manager, whereas the December  order, being\r\n\nunsigned, could not be plainly attributed to Jackson.\r\n\n                   II.

First, the Miller\r\n\nAct  allows recovery  from the  bond  by persons  who have  a\r\n\n\"direct  contractual relationship\"  with  either the  general\r\n\ncontractor  or  a  first-tier  subcontractor  of  the general\r\n\ncontractor.   40 U.S.C.    270b(a).   The  Supreme Court  has\r\n\ninterpreted  this  provision  to  preclude  recovery  on  the\r\n\npayment  bond by  anyone whose  relationship  to the  general\r\n\ncontractor is  more remote than a  second-tier subcontractor.\r\n\nSee J.W.

Wernick\r\n\nthereupon faxed copies  of Water Works's unpaid  invoices and\r\n\nproofs  of delivery  to Hyman,  thus informing  Hyman of  the\r\n\namount  Water  Works  claimed from  the  subcontractor.   The\r\n\ndistrict court found that, in these calls, Wernick also asked\r\n\nto obtain  a copy  of Hyman's payment  bond for  \"the express\r\n\n                             -12-\r\r\n\npurpose of filing  a bond claim.\"  Hyman's  personnel refused\r\n\nto release  the requested  bonding information,  but, as  the\r\n\ndistrict  court found,  they countered  with  a promise  that\r\n\nHyman would issue  joint checks payable to  Jackson and Water\r\n\nWorks,  a  device   to  ensure  payment  for   Water  Works's\r\n\nmaterials.  Wernick continued to communicate about the unpaid\r\n\nclaims with  Hyman  throughout the  month  of February.    On\r\n\nFebruary  9,  Wernick   spoke  again  with  the   same  Hyman\r\n\nemployees, who informed him that they were attempting to meet\r\n\nwith the  subcontractor to  discuss the issue  of the  unpaid\r\n\ninvoices.  Finally on March  7, after more phone calls, Water\r\n\nWorks sent to Hyman a copy of  a demand letter it had written\r\n\nto Calvesco.2  The copy reflected at the bottom not only that\r\n\na copy  had gone to  Hyman but that  copies had been  sent to\r\n\nHyman's three  Miller Act  Sureties.   Finally, on March  22,\r\n\n1995, Hyman wrote Water Works  thanking it for its  patience,\r\n\nindicating that it  had already paid Jackson,  expressing its\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Hyman argues that \"the facts of the present case are even\r\nmore persuasive  than Maccaferri or  Kinlau since Water Works\r                                                       \r\npurported demand  letter  .  .  .  was  not made  to  Hyman's\r                                                       \r\nsubcontractor Jackson, but rather to Calvesco.\"  However, the\r\nnames  \"Calvesco\"  and  \"Jackson\"  seem  to  have  been  used\r\ninterchangeably on various occasions, and there is absolutely\r\nno evidence that Hyman was  confused over the identity of the\r\nsubcontractor  identified  by  Water  Works.    Calvesco  and\r\nJackson were owned in  common and Hyman had  been a party  to\r\nthe  agreement  that  substituted  Jackson  for  Calvesco  as\r\nsubcontractor for the  Project.  While Hyman  personnel, like\r\nWater  Works,  sometimes  referred  to \"Calvesco,\"  the  name\r\n\"Jackson\" was correctly used by  Hyman in its March 22 letter\r\nto Water Works declining to pay its claim, showing that Hyman\r\nwas fully aware of thecorrect identity of the subcontractor. \r\n\n                             -13-\r\r\n\nreluctance  to pay the  same bill twice,  and informing Water\r\n\nWorks  that it  had \"turned  the  entire matter  over to  our\r\n\nattorneys and, on  their advi[c]e, we  are not paying  anyone\r\n\nuntil we have a clear picture of our options.\"\r\n\n          The above  evidence provides clear  indication that\r\n\nHyman  understood  that Water  Works  was looking  to  it for\r\n\npayment, having received, as the district court found \"actual\r\n\nnotice.\"  Wernick's  initial request for a copy  of the bond,\r\n\nfollowing his faxing of the unpaid invoices and his telephone\r\n\ncalls to Hyman about the debt, suggested that Water Works was\r\n\nlooking to it for payment.  Hyman's comprehension of this can\r\n\nbe  inferred from  Hyman's promise to  issue joint  checks in\r\n\nsubstitute for information  about the bond.  But  we need not\r\n\ndecide  whether  these  actions  by  themselves  sufficed  to\r\n\nconstitute  notice.   Following  these  and other  exchanges,\r\n\nWater Works  sent Hyman on  March 7  a copy of  Water Works's\r\n\ndemand   upon  the  subcontractor.     Unlike  the   copy  in\r\n\nMaccaferri, this  indicated at  the bottom  that copies  were\r                      \r\n\nalso being sent  to Hyman's three Sureties on  the Miller Act\r\n\nbond, each of which was designated  by name.  It is not  easy\r\n\nto  think of  a reason  to notify  the Sureties  unless Water\r\n\nWorks was looking to the bond for payment.\r\n\n          In  Maccaferri,  the  Eleventh  Circuit  held  that\r                                    \r\n\nmerely sending the general contractor a copy of the demand to\r\n\nthe subcontractor did not suffice  to show that the  supplier\r\n\n                             -14-\r\r\n\nwas looking for  payment to the general, but  the surrounding\r\n\ncircumstances  were  far  less  indicative that  payment  was\r\n\nsought, and there  was no indication  that the Sureties  were\r\n\nbeing sent  copies.  Here,  upon receipt of  a copy of  Water\r\n\nWorks's  demand upon  the subcontractor showing  plainly that\r\n\nother  copies had been sent  to Hyman's Sureties, Hyman could\r\n\nhave had no illusion that it was not being asked to pay.\r\n\n          Hyman's letter of March 22, 1995 fully confirms our\r\n\ninterpretation.   In the  letter, Hyman  thanked Water  Works\r\n\n\"for being so patient with us while we are trying to sort out\r\n\nthe problems\"  relative to  the Jackson  claims.   The letter\r\n\nwent  on to  speak  of  Hyman's  difficulties  with  Jackson,\r\n\nHyman's strong  reluctance to  pay the  same bill  twice, and\r\n\nthat it had  \"turned the entire matter over  to our attorneys\r\n\nand,  on their advice, we are not paying anyone until we have\r                                                           \r\n\na clear  picture of our  options\" (emphasis added).   \"In the\r\n\nend,\"  the  letter  went  on,  \"we  may,  in  fact,  be  held\r\n\nresponsible for paying these  invoices.  But we  will exhaust\r\n\nevery legal  remedy  before  we  do.\"    The  district  court\r\n\ninferred, and we  entirely agree, that this  letter must have\r\n\nbeen in  response to  what Hyman believed  was a  request for\r\n\npayment  by  Water Works.    See  Altech,  929 F.2d  at  1093\r                                                    \r\n\n(general  contractor's  letter held  to  provide  evidence of\r\n\nnotice).  \r\n\n                             -15-\r\r\n\n          We, therefore,  agree with the district  court that\r\n\nin this period  Hyman received notice sufficient  to meet the\r\n\nrequirements of the Miller Act.\r\n\n     2.   Timing of Water Works's Notice.\r                                                    \r\n\n          The district court found that the ninety-day period\r\n\nbegan  to run on December 29,  1994, the day that Water Works\r\n\nmade its  final  delivery of  materials  to the  Post  Office\r\n\nProject.   Thus, by  the court's calculations,  Water Works's\r\n\nletter of March  7, 1995, a copy  of which was sent  to Hyman\r\n\nand the Sureties,  and which in combination with  the earlier\r\n\ninvoices constituted the  written portion of the  notice, fit\r\n\nwithin the ninety-day limit.\r\n\n          In support of  its assertion that the  court should\r\n\nhave used the  date of the November order,  November 1, 1994,\r\n\nrather  than the date of  the December order when calculating\r\n\nthe ninety-day  time limit,  Hyman suggests  that each  order\r\n\nunder an  open account represents a separate contract with an\r\n\nindividual  ninety-day  limit.   See  United  States  ex rel.\r                                                                         \r\n\nRobert  DeFilippis  Crane  Serv.,  Inc. v.  William  L.

Under  this  reasoning,  Hyman\r\n\nargues,  the limit on the November order  had run by the time\r\n\nthat Water Works sent notice to Hyman.\r\n\n          While several district courts have held that Miller\r\n\nAct  notice runs  from each  order on  an open  contract, the\r\n\nweight  of authority contradicts  that position.   See United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates ex rel. A&amp;M Petroleum, Inc. v.

In  Noland,  the  Fourth  Circuit  reasoned  that,\r                                 \r\n\nalthough a  strict reading might  fulfill the purpose  of the\r\n\nnotice provision by  offering more protection to  the general\r\n\ncontractor, the goal  of a specific statutory  provision must\r\n\ntake a back seat to the purpose of the overall statute, which\r\n\nis  to provide  recovery  for  suppliers  who  have  provided\r\n\nmaterials but  not received  compensation.   See Noland,  273\r                                                                   \r\n\nF.2d at 920-21.\r\n\n          We  agree  with  the reasoning  in  Noland.   Where\r                                                                \r\n\nclaims are based  on an open  account theory, the  ninety-day\r\n\nnotice period for all of the deliveries begins on the date of\r\n\nthe last delivery to the project.  The parties to this action\r\n\nagree that Water Works delivered the last of its materials to\r\n\nthe Post Office  Project on December 29, 1994.   We therefore\r\n\n                             -17-\r\r\n\nconclude  that the district  court correctly refused  to deny\r\n\nrecovery on the November order  merely because it was part of\r\n\nan open account.\r\n\n          Hyman also  argues that, since  the district  court\r\n\ndenied  recovery to  Water  Works for  the December  order of\r\n\n$157.76,  it should not have used  the date of that order for\r\n\npurposes of calculating the timeliness of notice.  We are not\r\n\npersuaded.\r\n\n          As  an initial  matter, we  note  that the  statute\r\n\nstates that  the time  limit runs from  the date of  the last\r\n\ndelivery of material \"for which a claim  is made.\"  40 U.S.C.\r\n\n  270b(a).  The statute does not  start the time limit on the\r\n\nlast  claim for which the plaintiff eventually recovers; such\r\n\na provision might prove unworkable.\r\n\n          But   even  if  the  statute  runs  from  the  last\r\n\nrecoverable claim, we see little  problem.  In denying  Water\r\n\nWorks  recovery on  the December  order,  the district  court\r\n\nwrote a footnote explaining its reasoning for  distinguishing\r\n\nbetween  the November and December orders: the November order\r\n\nform contained the name of a Jackson employee while there was\r\n\nno name on the December  order.  The district court concluded\r\n\nthat there was \"no evidence as to whether Calvesco or Jackson\r\n\nplaced the [December] order.\"  Accordingly, the court limited\r\n\nWater Works's recovery  to the amount  of the November  order\r\n\n($53,493.83) plus costs and interest.\r\n\n                             -18-\r\r\n\n          The  undisputed facts are as follows.  First, Water\r\n\nWorks provided materials that were incorporated into the Post\r\n\nOffice Project.   Second, Water Works did  not begin shipping\r\n\nthese materials until after Jackson became the  subcontractor\r\n\non the  Project.  Third,  although Water Works  insisted upon\r\n\nsending its invoices  to Calvesco, Jackson paid for the first\r\n\nfive shipments  by Water Works.   Fourth, Calvesco was  not a\r\n\nsubcontractor on the Project during the time that Water Works\r\n\nshipped materials to the Project.   Fifth, the last date that\r\n\nWater Works delivered  materials to the Project  was December\r\n\n29, 1994.\r\n\n          On these facts,  we see no reason for  the court to\r\n\nhave  questioned if Calvesco  rather than Jackson  placed the\r\n\nDecember order.  Calvesco, having been replaced by Jackson as\r\n\nthe  subcontractor on the Post  Office Project, had no reason\r\n\nto  order  materials  for  this  job.   The  only  reasonable\r\n\ninference  is  that  Jackson placed  this  order,  as  it did\r\n\nearlier ones.   While in the  absence of a  cross appeal, the\r\n\ncourt's denial  of the  $157.76 stands, we  see no  reason to\r\n\nreject the court's  determination that the December  29, 1994\r\n\ndate triggered the notice period.\r\n\n          As  the notice  was adequate  and  as the  district\r\n\ncourt  did  not  err  in  beginning  the  notice period  from\r\n\nDecember   29,  1994,  Water   Works  satisfied   the  notice\r\n\nrequirements of the Miller Act.\r\n\n                             -19-\r\r\n\n     C.   Water Works's Relationship to Hyman.\r                                                         \r\n\n          In order to recover from the payment bond, a person\r\n\nmust have a \"direct contractual relationship\" either with the\r\n\ngeneral contractor or with a direct subcontractor.  40 U.S.C.\r\n\n  270b(a); see  also Bateson, 434 U.S. at 590-91.   Hyman and\r                                        \r\n\nWater  Works  agree  that they  had  no  direct relationship.\r\n\nHyman argues further  that Water Works did not  have a direct\r\n\ncontractual relationship with any of Hyman's  subcontractors.\r\n\nHyman  relies upon  the  undisputed  fact  that  Water  Works\r\n\nconsistently refused to extend credit to Jackson and regarded\r\n\nCalvesco as its customer.\r\n\n          As  the district court correctly noted, courts have\r\n\nallowed  recovery under  the  Miller  Act  by  suppliers  who\r\n\nfurnish materials  to a subcontractor  \"from time to  time on\r\n\nopen account  . .  . without formal  contract.\"   Noland, 273\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d at  919; see also  Apache Powder Co. v.

It is  undisputed that\r\n\nWater  Works supplied  materials  to  the  Project  and  that\r\n\nJackson  was  the   demolition,  excavation  and   site  work\r\n\nsubcontractor  on the Post Office Project after September 27,\r\n\n1994.  In addition, Jackson, rather than Calvesco, paid Water\r\n\nWorks's  first five invoices.  This evidence clearly supports\r\n\nthe  district court's  finding  of the  existence of  an open\r\n\naccount  between Jackson and Water  Works.  Since Jackson was\r\n\n                             -20-\r\r\n\nHyman's direct subcontractor,  the Act's tiering requirements\r\n\nare satisfied.\r\n\n          Since we  find  that the  district court  correctly\r\n\nallowed Water Works to recover  under an open account theory,\r\n\nwe need not address the propriety of its alternative holding,\r\n\nwhich allowed recovery on the basis of quantum meruit.\r\n\n          We   have   carefully  considered   Hyman's   other\r\n\narguments; none of them  persuade us that the district  court\r\n\nerred in its determination.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                             -21-\r\r\n</pre>",
