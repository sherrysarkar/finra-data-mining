(\"Astra\" or \"the\r\n\ncompany\") challenges a preliminary injunction restraining it from\r\n\nentering  into  or  enforcing  settlement  agreements  containing\r\n\nprovisions  that prohibit  settling  employees both  from  filing\r\n\ncharges  of   sexual  harassment   with   the  Equal   Employment\r\n\nOpportunity  Commission  (\"EEOC\"  or \"the  Commission\")  and from\r\n\nassisting  the  Commission  in  its  investigation  of  any  such\r\n\ncharges.1  For the reasons that follow, we affirm the preliminary\r\n\ninjunction in part and vacate it in part.\r\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          The  EEOC  is   currently  investigating  three  sexual\r\n\nharassment  charges filed against Astra.   At least  two of these\r\n\ncharges allege  class-wide improprieties.  The controversy before\r\n\nus arose  when the Commission found its investigation hampered by\r\n\ncertain  settlement agreements  entered  into  between Astra  and\r\n\nsundry employees who  theretofore had  pursued sexual  harassment\r\n\nclaims.   The problem first  surfaced when an  EEOC investigator,\r\n\nBrenda  Choresi Carter, spoke with a former Astra employee on May\r\n\n7,  1996.   According  to Carter,  the  employee stated  that she\r\n\npossessed relevant information but was unable to disclose it \"due\r\n\nto a confidential  settlement agreement that she had entered into\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The settlement agreements involve, and the district court's\r\ninjunction covers, both employees  and former employees of Astra.\r\nIt is unnecessary  to distinguish  between these  two groups  for\r\npurposes of  this appeal.   Consequently, we  use the  collective\r\nnoun      \"employees\"     to  encompass  both  past  and  present\r\nemployees.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nwith Astra.\"  Although this conversation supplies the EEOC's most\r\n\nconcrete proof  that Astra's settlement agreements  are hindering\r\n\nits  probe, the Commission also points  to other evidence hinting\r\n\nthat  the  agreements may  be  stifling potential  sources.   One\r\n\nemployee  who expressed  reluctance about  speaking with  an EEOC\r\n\ninvestigator  refused  to  say whether  she  had  entered  into a\r\n\nsettlement agreement.  Then, too, when  the EEOC contacted ninety\r\n\nemployees and  requested  information, only  twenty-six  replied.\r\n\nAlthough the Commission finds this widespread unresponsiveness to\r\n\nbe sinister, its cause is unproven.\r\n\n          This  is  the extent  of the  hard  evidence as  to the\r\n\nimpact of the settlement  agreements on the EEOC's investigation.\r\n\nIn  all events,  the Commission  has not  unleashed  its subpoena\r\n\npower, see 42 U.S.C.   2000e-9 (1994) (incorporating by reference\r                    \r\n\n29  U.S.C.   161), to compel any recalcitrant employee to furnish\r\n\nrelevant information.\r\n\n          The record reveals that Astra has entered into at least\r\n\neleven settlement agreements   the exact number remains uncertain\r\n\n  with  employees who claimed  to have  been subjected to,  or to\r\n\nhave  witnessed,  sexual  harassment.     The  details  of  these\r\n\nagreements vary, but they all contain versions of four provisions\r\n\nthat are relevant to the disposition of  this appeal.  First, the\r\n\nsettling  employee agrees  not to  file a  charge with  the EEOC.\r\n\nSecond,  the settling  employee agrees  not to assist  others who\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nfile  charges with  the  EEOC.2    Third, the  settling  employee\r\n\nreleases all employment-related claims against Astra and those in\r\n\nprivity with  Astra (including Astra's management).   Fourth, the\r\n\nsettling employee assents to a confidentiality regime under which\r\n\nshe is barred from  discussing the incident(s) that gave  rise to\r\n\nher  claim and  from  disclosing  the  terms  of  her  settlement\r\n\nagreement.\r\n\n          After the EEOC learned of Astra's artful draftsmanship,\r\n\nit  asked the company to rescind those portions of the settlement\r\n\nagreements that prohibited  individuals from filing charges  with\r\n\nthe Commission  (\"non-filing  provisions\") and  from  aiding  the\r\n\nCommission's investigations (\"non-assistance provisions\").  Astra\r\n\ndefended  both the  non-filing and the  non-assistance provisions\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2While the  precise phraseology  of the non-filing  and non-\r\nassistance  covenants varies from pact to pact, the import is the\r\nsame.    By  way  of  illustration,  a  representative  agreement\r\ncontains a covenant binding the settling employee \"not to file or\r\nto assist in any way anyone else  who files any claim, complaint,\r\nor  charge nor institute any lawsuit against ASTRA, its officers,\r\ndirectors, agents, or  employees arising out of her employment or\r\ntermination of employment with  ASTRA, including, but not limited\r\nto, any  claim,  complaint, charge,  or lawsuit  under the  Civil\r\nRights Act  of 1991, Title VII  of the Civil Rights  Act of 1964,\r\nAmericans   with  Disabilities   Act,   the  Massachusetts   Fair\r\nEmployment  Practice  Act, any  other  federal  or state  law  or\r\nstatute, or any  claim which  could be alleged  under the  common\r\nlaw.\"   In another iteration, some  settlement agreements confirm\r\nthat  the  settling  party  will  not  \"voluntarily  provide  any\r\nassistance\" to persons asserting claims against Astra.\r\n      While the non-assistance provisions  have two facets   they\r\npurport to bar assistance to both the EEOC and fellow employees  \r\nthe Commission  so far has challenged only that facet of the non-\r\nassistance   provisions  which   purports  to   prevent  settling\r\nemployees from communicating with the Commission.  Since the EEOC\r\nhas  not  yet  objected  to  that   part  of  the  non-assistance\r\nprovisions  which  precludes  a  settling  employee  from  aiding\r\nanother  employee in preferring a claim against Astra, we take no\r\nview of that aspect of the matter.\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nbut added that it \"do[es] not interpret any settlement  agreement\r\n\nas preventing any . . . employee from communicating with the EEOC\r\n\nconcerning any of its investigations.\"  Astra's concession on the\r\n\nright of  settling employees  to communicate with  the Commission\r\n\nremains  somewhat tenebrous:    at oral  argument, the  company's\r\n\ncounsel  suggested that  employees must  await a  subpoena before\r\n\nsharing  information  with  the   EEOC.    At  any   rate,  Astra\r\n\nsteadfastly maintains  that employees who have  signed settlement\r\n\nagreements may  not volunteer  any information to  the Commission\r\n\nthat is beyond the scope of an ongoing investigation.\r\n\n          Dissatisfied with Astra's response, the EEOC filed suit\r\n\nseeking injunctive relief pursuant  to section 706(f)(2) of Title\r\n\nVII, 42 U.S.C.   2000e-5(f)(2).  Without convening an evidentiary\r\n\nhearing, the district court granted the request for a preliminary\r\n\ninjunction and enjoined Astra  for the time being \"from  entering\r\n\ninto or  enforcing provisions of any  Settlement Agreements which\r\n\nprohibit current or former employees from filing charges with the\r\n\nEEOC and/or assisting the Commission  in its investigation of any\r\n\ncharges.\"  EEOC v. Astra U.S.A., Inc., 929 F. Supp.  512, 521 (D.\r                                               \r\n\nMass. 1996).  The court also directed Astra to \"provide a copy of\r\n\nthis  injunction to  all  current and  former employees  who have\r\n\nsigned Settlement  Agreements to  assure them of  notification of\r\n\ntheir  rights set  forth  herein.\"    Id.    Astra  appealed  and\r                                                   \r\n\nrequested  interim relief.    We  stayed  the  operation  of  the\r\n\ninjunction (subject to certain  conditions not relevant here) and\r\n\nexpedited appellate proceedings.\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nII.  ANALYSIS\r          II.  ANALYSIS\r\n\n          We  first delineate  certain  legal  standards (a  task\r\n\nthat, in  this  instance,  requires  us to  resolve  a  threshold\r\n\nquestion).  We  then evaluate  the injunction as  it affects  the\r\n\nnon-assistance and non-filing provisions, respectively.\r\n\n       A.

The Applicable Preliminary Injunction Standard.\r                                                                   \r\n\n          In  the  typical  case,  a  party  seeking  preliminary\r\n\ninjunctive  relief must prove:   (1) a  substantial likelihood of\r\n\nsuccess on the merits; (2) a significant risk of irreparable harm\r\n\nif  the  injunction  is  withheld;  (3)  a  favorable  balance of\r\n\nhardships;  and  (4) a  fit (or,  at least,  a lack  of friction)\r\n\nbetween the injunction and the public interest.  See Narragansett\r                                                                           \r\n\nIndian  Tribe v. Guilbert, 934 F.2d 4,  5 (1st Cir. 1991).  Here,\r                                   \r\n\nhowever,  the EEOC  asserts  that Congress,  by enacting  section\r\n\n706(f)(2)  of Title  VII, specifically  authorized the  agency to\r\n\nseek  injunctive relief in the  public interest.3   Based on this\r\n\ncircumstance,  the  EEOC argues  that  it  need  not satisfy  the\r\n\ntraditional test for preliminary injunctive relief  but, instead,\r\n\nmust  only meet  the  built-in criterion  that section  706(f)(2)\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3The statute provides in material part:\r\n\n               Whenever  a charge  is  filed  with  the\r\n          Commission  and  the Commission  concludes on\r\n          the basis of a preliminary investigation that\r\n          prompt  judicial action is necessary to carry\r\n          out the purposes of this  Act, the Commission\r\n          .  . .  may bring  an action  for appropriate\r\n          temporary or preliminary relief pending final\r\n          disposition of such charge.\r\n\n42 U.S.C.   2000e-5(f)(2).\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nitself  establishes.     On   this  approach  an   injunction  is\r\n\nappropriate  as  long  as  the  Commission,  after  conducting  a\r\n\npreliminary investigation of a pending  charge of discrimination,\r\n\n(1) determines that prompt  judicial intervention is essential to\r\n\ncarry out  the purposes of Title  VII, and (2) makes  out a prima\r\n\nfacie  case that  the defendant  has committed  (or is  likely to\r\n\ncommit) serious violations of  Title VII which, if  not enjoined,\r\n\nwill frustrate the  Act's purposes.  In practice,  the difference\r\n\nbetween the  two approaches may be more  apparent than real.  The\r\n\nEEOC, however, sees two key distinctions:  under its approach the\r\n\npublic  interest prong  becomes  a foregone  conclusion (for  the\r\n\nCommission  is   itself  the  standard-bearer   for  the   public\r\n\ninterest),  and,  in addition,  a  somewhat  lessened showing  of\r\n\nirreparable  harm   may  be   adequate  to  justify   preliminary\r\n\ninjunctive relief.\r\n\n          The circuits are in some disarray regarding whether the\r\n\nEEOC  must meet  the  traditional four-part  test for  injunctive\r\n\nrelief.   See, e.g., Baker  v. Buckeye Cellulose  Corp., 856 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n167, 169 (11th Cir. 1988) (holding  that an allegation of a Title\r\n\nVII violation establishes a rebuttable presumption of irreparable\r\n\ninjury);  EEOC v. Pacific Press  Pub. Ass'n, 535  F.2d 1182, 1187\r                                                     \r\n\n(9th  Cir.  1976)  (suggesting  that \"the  usual  requirement  of\r\n\nirreparable  injury is  relaxed\" when  the EEOC  seeks injunctive\r\n\nrelief  pendente lite); cf. EEOC v. Cosmair, Inc., 821 F.2d 1085,\r                                                           \r\n\n1090 (5th Cir. 1986) (holding,  in an ADEA case, that \"[w]hen  an\r\n\ninjunction is  expressly authorized by statute  and the statutory\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nconditions are satisfied, the  movant need not establish specific\r\n\nirreparable injury to obtain a preliminary injunction\").\r\n\n          Amidst these subtly shaded solutions, the Sixth Circuit\r\n\nstruck  a  blow  for  clarity  and  flatly  rejected  the  EEOC's\r\n\ninterpretation of section 706(f)(2).

We think that\r               \r\n\nthis is  the right result.   There is nothing in  the language of\r\n\nsection 706(f)(2) that  can fairly  be read to  limit a  district\r\n\ncourt's  discretion  in  issuing  preliminary  injunctions.    In\r\n\nauthorizing  the  EEOC  to   \"bring  an  action  for  appropriate\r\n\ntemporary or preliminary relief,\" the statute does not purport to\r\n\nwrest  the final decision on whether relief is warranted from the\r\n\ncourts.  See id. at 1041 &amp; n.4 (comparing    706(f)(2) with other\r                          \r\n\nfederal statutes  which by  their language restrict  the district\r\n\ncourts' discretion in issuing injunctions).  Moreover, this court\r\n\nhas  consistently  emphasized  the  importance of  a  showing  of\r\n\nirreparable  harm in  the calculus  of  injunctive relief.   See,\r                                                                          \r\n\ne.g., Gately v.

In our view this\r                                \r\n\nprinciple, which is  predicated on the teaching that \"[t]he basis\r\n\nof  injunctive  relief  in  the federal  courts  has  always been\r\n\nirreparable  harm  and  inadequacy  of  legal  remedies,\"  Beacon\r                                                                           \r\n\nTheatres,  Inc. v.

First,\r\n\nit  claims  that the  injunction  issued  without a  satisfactory\r\n\nshowing  of  irreparable  harm.    Second,  it  claims  that  the\r\n\ninjunction  is   unnecessary  because   it  now   interprets  the\r\n\nsettlement agreements  to permit  various types  of communication\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4Although  the precise  terms of  the  settlement agreements\r\nvary,  see supra note  2 &amp; accompanying text,  we think that many\r                          \r\nsettling parties  would interpret these provisions,  however they\r\nmay  be couched, as barring them from volunteering information to\r\nthe EEOC or cooperating with its investigators.\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nwith the EEOC.  Both claims lack force.\r\n\n          In determining whether the district court was justified\r\n\nin  finding a significant risk of irreparable harm, we first note\r\n\nthat when  the likelihood of  success on the  merits is great,  a\r\n\nmovant can show somewhat less in  the way of irreparable harm and\r\n\nstill   garner  preliminary  injunctive  relief.

Thus,  we  start this  phase  of our\r                            \r\n\ninquiry by addressing whether a broad non-assistance agreement is\r\n\nvoid as against  public policy.   If it  is overwhelmingly  clear\r\n\nthat the  provisions prohibiting settlors from  assisting in EEOC\r\n\ninvestigations offend public policy,  a lesser showing that those\r\n\nprovisions are causing irreparable harm will suffice to support a\r\n\npreliminary injunction barring their enforcement.\r\n\n          We build on bedrock.   \"[A] promise is unenforceable if\r\n\nthe   interest  in   its   enforcement  is   outweighed  in   the\r\n\ncircumstances by  a public  policy harmed  by enforcement of  the\r\n\nagreement.\"  Town of Newton v. Rumery, 480 U.S. 386, 392  (1987).\r                                               \r\n\nIn  performing that balancing here,  we must weigh  the impact of\r\n\nsettlement  provisions that effectively  bar cooperation with the\r\n\nEEOC  on the  enforcement of  Title VII  against the  impact that\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\noutlawing  such   provisions  would   have  on   private  dispute\r\n\nresolution.\r\n\n          Congress  entrusted  the  Commission  with  significant\r\n\nenforcement responsibilities  in respect  to Title  VII.  See  42\r                                                                       \r\n\nU.S.C.     2000e-5(a).   To  fulfill  the  core  purposes of  the\r\n\nstatutory scheme, \"it is crucial that the Commission's ability to\r\n\ninvestigate charges  of systemic discrimination not be impaired.\"\r\n\nEEOC  v. Shell  Oil Co.,  466 U.S.  54, 69  (1984).   Clearly, if\r                                 \r\n\nvictims  of  or witnesses  to  sexual  harassment are  unable  to\r\n\napproach  the   EEOC  or  even  to  answer   its  questions,  the\r\n\ninvestigatory powers  that  Congress conferred  would be  sharply\r\n\ncurtailed and  the efficacy  of investigations would  be severely\r\n\nhampered.\r\n\n          What  is  more, the  EEOC acts  not  only on  behalf of\r\n\nprivate  parties but  also \"to  vindicate the public  interest in\r\n\npreventing employment discrimination.\"  General Tel. Co. v. EEOC,\r                                                                          \r\n\n446   U.S.  318,  326  (1980).    In  many  cases  of  widespread\r\n\ndiscrimination, victims suffer in silence.   In such instances, a\r\n\nsprinkling  of  settlement agreements  that  contain stipulations\r\n\nprohibiting cooperation with the EEOC could effectively thwart an\r\n\nagency  investigation.    Thus,  any  agreement  that  materially\r\n\ninterferes  with  communication  between   an  employee  and  the\r\n\nCommission sows the seeds  of harm to  the public interest.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nCosmair,  821  F.2d at  1090 (stating  that  \"an employer  and an\r                 \r\n\nemployee  cannot agree  to deny  to the  EEOC the  information it\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nneeds to advance this public interest\").5\r\n\n          To  complete  the balance  we  must  next address  what\r\n\nimpact the injunction against non-assistance covenants might have\r\n\non  private  dispute resolution.   We  do  not doubt  that public\r\n\npolicy  strongly  favors  encouraging  voluntary   settlement  of\r\n\nemployment discrimination claims.   See, e.g., Carson v. American\r                                                                           \r\n\nBrands, Inc., 450  U.S. 79, 88 n.14 (1981).   Yet we fail  to see\r                      \r\n\nthat  this  portion  of  the  injunction  creates  a  substantial\r\n\ndisincentive to settlement, and Astra makes no plausible argument\r\n\nto the contrary.  Simply put,  this monition does nothing at  all\r\n\nto  promote further  litigation  between Astra  and the  settling\r\n\nemployee or to disturb the finality of the negotiated settlement.\r\n\nThus, weighing  the significant  public  interest in  encouraging\r\n\ncommunication with  the EEOC  against the minimal  adverse impact\r\n\nthat  opening  the  channels   of  communication  would  have  on\r\n\nsettlement,  we agree  wholeheartedly with  the lower  court that\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5Cosmair  arose under the  Age Discrimination  in Employment\r                       \r\nAct (ADEA), 29 U.S.C.     621-634 (1994), and Astra  asserts that\r\nit is inapposite here because unsupervised settlement  agreements\r\nthat waive employees' claims are more suspect under the ADEA than\r\nunder  Title VII.    This assertion  is  based on  a  fundamental\r\nmisunderstanding.  The right to assist the EEOC is not a damages-\r\ndriven right.   Indeed, the  court below  specifically held  that\r\nsettling employees  had waived  the right to  recover damages  in\r\neither their own lawsuits  or in lawsuits brought by the  EEOC on\r\ntheir behalf.   See Astra, 929 F.  Supp. at 521.   In contrast to\r                                   \r\nthe individual  right to recover damages,  however, an employee's\r\nright  to  communicate with  the EEOC  must  be protected  not to\r\nsafeguard the settling  employee's entitlement to recompense  but\r\ninstead to  safeguard the public  interest.   Hence, it is  not a\r\nright that an employer can purchase from an employee, nor is it a\r\nright that an employee can sell  to her employer.  Thus, a waiver\r\nof  the right to assist the EEOC offends public policy under both\r\nthe ADEA and Title VII.\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\nnon-assistance  covenants which  prohibit communication  with the\r\n\nEEOC are void as against public policy.\r\n\n          We now  return to  Astra's principal assertion:   that,\r\n\nbecause the EEOC  could obtain the  information it seeks  through\r\n\nthe   use  of  its  subpoena  power,  there  is  no  evidence  of\r\n\nirreparable harm and, hence, no basis for fashioning the disputed\r\n\nsegment of  the injunction.  This boils down to a contention that\r\n\nemployees who have signed settlement agreements should speak only\r\n\nwhen spoken to.  We reject such a repressive construct.  It would\r\n\nbe most peculiar to insist that  the EEOC resort to its  subpoena\r\n\npower  when  public policy  so clearly  favors  the free  flow of\r\n\ninformation  between   victims  of  harassment   and  the  agency\r\n\nentrusted with righting the  wrongs inflicted upon them.   Such a\r\n\nprotocol  would  not  only   stultify  investigations  but   also\r\n\nsignificantly increase the time and expense of a probe.\r\n\n          In any  event, the district court  specifically found a\r\n\nlikelihood of irreparable harm \"because  the Commission's ability\r\n\nto  investigate charges  of discrimination  and to  enforce anti-\r\n\ndiscrimination laws has been  and continues to be impeded  by the\r\n\nchilling  effect  caused  by  the  offending  provisions  of  the\r\n\nAgreements.\"    Astra,  929 F.  Supp.  at  520.   Given  Carter's\r                               \r\n\naffidavit  and  the likely  effect  of  the  wording  that  Astra\r\n\ninserted  into the settlement  agreements, see  supra note  2, we\r                                                               \r\n\nthink  that  this  finding is  supportable.    Thus,  there is  a\r\n\nsufficient risk of irremediable harm to warrant the issuance of a\r\n\npreliminary   injunction   addressed   to    the   non-assistance\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\nprovisions.\r\n\n          Astra   further   argues   that   an    injunction   is\r\n\ninappropriate  because  it  does  not  interpret  the  settlement\r\n\nagreements as barring communication with the EEOC.  This argument\r\n\nis doubly  flawed.  In  the first  place, Astra admits  only that\r\n\nsettlors may  answer questions when  subpoenaed by the  EEOC, and\r\n\nthat is much too narrow a concession.  In the second place, Astra\r\n\ncannot defeat  an injunction  now by indulging  in a  revisionist\r\n\ninterpretation  of the  settlement agreements  that would  permit\r\n\nfull and  open communication with the  EEOC.  \"It is  the duty of\r\n\nthe  courts to beware of  efforts to defeat  injunctive relief by\r\n\nprotestations   of  repentance   and   reform,  especially   when\r\n\nabandonment  seems timed  to anticipate  suit .  . .  .\"   United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Oregon State  Medical Soc'y, 343 U.S. 326,  333 (1952);\r                                               \r\n\naccord  Chang v. Univ. of  R.I., 606 F.

Here,  Astra  drafted  aggressive settlement  agreements\r\n\nunder  which  employees pledged  \"not to  assist  in any  way\" in\r\n\nproceedings  against it.   The  district court  supportably found\r\n\nthat these agreements had  in fact chilled communications between\r\n\nthe  settling  employees  and  the EEOC.    Astra's  attempts  to\r\n\nreinterpret the operative provisions of its agreements when under\r\n\nsiege come too late to prevent the issuance of an injunction.\r\n\n          We  need not  add hues  to the  rainbow.   The district\r\n\ncourt neither  misperceived the law nor misused its discretion in\r\n\nenjoining the utilization of settlement provisions  that prohibit\r\n\nemployees  from assisting  the EEOC  in investigating  charges of\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\ndiscrimination.   Consequently,  employees who  have signed  such\r\n\nsettlement  agreements   may  respond  to  questions   from  EEOC\r\n\ninvestigators  and  also  may  volunteer  information  concerning\r\n\nsexual harassment at Astra to the EEOC.6\r\n\n                    C.

Astra assigns  error.  It  argues, inter\r                                                                           \r\n\nalia,  that   public  policy  favors  the   enforcement  of  such\r              \r\n\ncovenants;  that the EEOC will not suffer irreparable harm in the\r\n\nabsence  of an  injunction; and  that the  restraint  exceeds the\r\n\nbounds  authorized under 42  U.S.C.   2000e-5(f)(2).   Because we\r\n\nagree that  the EEOC  has made  no  showing that  it will  suffer\r\n\nirreparable  harm  in  the   absence  of  this  portion   of  the\r\n\ninjunction, we decline to reach Astra's other claims.\r\n\n          Our  analysis of  this issue  does not  evolve from  an\r\n\nexploration  of   the  relation  between   irreparable  harm  and\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6Though  the  injunction does  not specifically  address the\r\nconfidentiality covenants  to which the settlement agreements are\r\nsubject,  the terms of the injunction forbid Astra from enforcing\r\nany contractual  provisions that  impede settling  employees from\r             \r\nassisting  the  EEOC  in   ongoing  investigations.    Thus,  the\r\ninjunction    effectively    precludes    enforcement   of    the\r\nconfidentiality  covenants to  block the divulgement  of relevant\r\ninformation (including divulgement of  the entire contents of any\r\nparticular settlement agreement) to the  Commission.  We need not\r\nprobe this point  more deeply, because  Astra now interprets  the\r\nconfidentiality  language  as   inapplicable  to   communications\r\nbetween  settling employees and  the EEOC relevant  to an ongoing\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\nlikelihood  of success  on  the merits.    That inquiry  is  most\r\n\nutilitarian in instances in which the issue is whether the degree\r\n\nof harm is sufficient  to warrant injunctive relief.   See, e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nsupra Part II(B).  Here, however, there is no significant risk of\r               \r\n\nirreparable  harm    and  that fact  alone  is dispositive.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nGately, 2 F.3d at 1232.\r                \r\n\n          This  conclusion rests on the role that the filing of a\r\n\ncharge plays in the statutory scheme.   The EEOC has no authority\r\n\nto  conduct an  investigation  based on  hunch  or suspicion,  no\r\n\nmatter how plausible that hunch or suspicion may be.  The reverse\r\n\nis true:  the Commission's power to investigate is dependent upon\r\n\nthe filing  of  a  charge  of discrimination.    \"[U]nlike  other\r\n\nfederal agencies that  possess plenary authority to demand to see\r\n\nrecords relevant  to matters within their  jurisdiction, the EEOC\r\n\nis  entitled to access only  to evidence `relevant  to the charge\r\n\nunder  investigation.'\"    Shell Oil,  466  U.S.  at 64  (quoting\r                                              \r\n\nstatute).\r\n\n          Once a  charge is  filed with  the EEOC,  the situation\r\n\nchanges dramatically.  The allegations contained in the charge do\r\n\nnot   narrowly   circumscribe  the   Commission's  investigation.\r\n\nRather,  the charge  serves  as  \"a  jurisdictional  springboard\"\r\n\nenabling the  Commission \"to investigate whether  the employer is\r\n\nengaged  in any discriminatory practices.\"  EEOC v. Huttig Sash &amp;\r                                                                           \r\n\nDoor Co.,  511 F.2d  453, 455  (5th Cir. 1975).   So  viewed, the\r                  \r\n\ncharge is capable of  supporting an EEOC investigation  into both\r\n\nthe  discrimination described in  the charge itself  and into the\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\nsurrounding  circumstances  (including  a  full  probing  of  any\r\n\nevidence of discriminatory practices  unearthed during the course\r\n\nof  the initial investigation).   See EEOC v.  General Elec. Co.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n532 F.2d 359, 366 (4th Cir. 1976).\r\n\n          Given  this   set  of   rules,  the  EEOC's   claim  of\r\n\nirreparable harm  cannot withstand scrutiny.  The EEOC is already\r\n\ninvestigating three  charges against  Astra, two of  which allege\r\n\nclass-wide  sexual harassment  in the  workplace.   These charges\r\n\nprovide  the  EEOC  with   jurisdiction  to  conduct  a  thorough\r\n\ninvestigation  into incidents  of  sexual  harassment,  invidious\r\n\npractices, and other prohibited conduct that may have occurred at\r\n\nAstra over  time.  Additionally,  the portion  of the  injunction\r\n\nthat prevents the enforcement  of the settlement agreements' non-\r\n\nassistance provisions     a portion  of  the injunction  that  we\r\n\nuphold, see supra  Part II(B)    ensures that  employees will  be\r                           \r\n\nable to cooperate freely with the EEOC's investigators.\r\n\n          The  short of  it is  that,  once an  injunction issues\r\n\nprohibiting  Astra from  enforcing the  non-assistance covenants,\r\n\nthis case offers  no prospect  of irreparable harm  to the  EEOC.\r\n\nThus,  the judicial  restraint  that the  district court  imposed\r\n\nagainst  enforcement  of  the non-filing  covenants  violates the\r\n\ntenet that \"injunctive relief should be no more burdensome to the\r\n\ndefendant  than  necessary  to  provide complete  relief  to  the\r\n\nplaintiffs.\"  Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702 (1979).\r                                            \r\n\n          This case  is  an especially  attractive candidate  for\r\n\napplication  of the  Yamasaki  doctrine.   The difficult,  highly\r                                       \r\n\n                                18\r\r\n\nramified  questions  that  surround the  validity  of  non-filing\r\n\ncovenants counsel persuasively against  reaching out past what is\r\n\nrequired during the preliminary injunction  phase.  Consequently,\r\n\nwe believe it was  inadvisable   and legally incorrect    for the\r\n\ndistrict court, on the sparse evidence contained  in this record,\r\n\nto attempt  to confront the thorny question of whether agreements\r\n\nnot to  file charges  with the  EEOC are void  as against  public\r\n\npolicy.   Courts should take  care not  to yearn for  the blossom\r\n\nwhen only the bud is ready.7\r\n\n          In  an  effort to  coax  a different  result,  the EEOC\r\n\nbemoans the increased  burden that  it would  face if  it had  to\r\n\ncompel potential witnesses' cooperation  by subpoena.  As applied\r\n\nto this  portion of the preliminary  injunction, the Commission's\r\n\nasseveration  is a non  sequitur.  As long  as enforcement of the\r\n\nnon-assistance   covenants  is   enjoined,  the   EEOC's  current\r\n\ninvestigations  will  not be  impeded  even  if settling  parties\r\n\ncannot  file additional charges.   And as we  have already noted,\r\n\nthose investigations  are sufficiently  broad in scope  to permit\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     7We take no view today of the validity vel non of non-filing\r                                                             \r\ncovenants.  The question  is close and the answer  is not obvious\r\nto us.   On  one hand,  a charge is  sometimes a  prerequisite to\r\naction in  the public  interest by the  EEOC; that  consideration\r\nargues for abrogating such covenants.  On the other hand, if non-\r\nfiling  agreements  are   unenforceable,  private  settlement  of\r\nharassment claims  will be  hindered significantly  and employers\r\nseeking finality may well insist that employees file charges with\r\nthe EEOC  as a precondition to any settlement; this consideration\r\nargues for upholding  such covenants.   All in  all, we  conclude\r\nthat trying to  resolve the  tension between  these laudable  but\r\ncompeting goals in  a case in  which no discernible need  for the\r\nrequested  relief exists and no fully developed factual record is\r\navailable courts potential mischief.\r\n\n                                19\r\r\n\nthe Commission to get to the bottom of the unsavory (but, as yet,\r\n\nunproven) allegations that are swirling around the company.\r\n\n          To be  sure, we are  cognizant of the  possibility that\r\n\nadditional charges filed with  the EEOC perhaps could serve  as a\r\n\nbasis to expand the temporal scope of the ongoing investigations.\r\n\nThus,   the   non-filing    covenants,   if   left   undisturbed,\r\n\ntheoretically  could  limit  the  claims of  some  class  members\r\n\nagainst  Astra, and this limitation might in turn provide a basis\r\n\nfor a finding of irreparable harm.  But that is sheer speculation\r\n\non  this exiguous record.   Absent any hard  evidence that anyone\r\n\nwho signed a settlement  agreement with Astra now seeks  to press\r\n\ncharges  with  the  EEOC  which,  if  filed,  would   expand  the\r\n\ninvestigations' scope, the disputed  portion of the injunction is\r\n\nunwarranted.   If the  EEOC's investigations subsequently  reveal\r\n\nthat  such a situation actually exists, that is the time to renew\r\n\nthe quest for an injunction against enforcement of the non-filing\r\n\nprovisions contained in Astra's settlement agreements.\r\n\nIII.  CONCLUSION\r          III.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We  need go  no further.   The  EEOC will  receive full\r\n\nrelief from that portion of the district court's injunction which\r\n\nrestrains  Astra  from  entering   into  or  enforcing  the  non-\r\n\nassistance provisions of its settlement agreements.  We therefore\r\n\naffirm  that  portion  of  the  injunction,  vacate  the  portion\r\n\nenjoining  Astra  from  entering  into  or  enforcing  non-filing\r\n\ncovenants in connection with those agreements, and remand for the\r\n\nentry of a revised decree consistent herewith.\r\n\n                                20\r\r\n\n          Affirmed in  part, vacated in part, and  remanded.

(\"Astra\" or \"the company\") challenges a preliminary injunction restraining it from entering into or enforcing settlement agreements containing provisions that prohibit settling employees both from filing charges of sexual harassment with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\" or \"the Commission\") and from assisting the Commission in its investigation of any such charges.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  For the reasons that follow, we affirm the preliminary injunction in part and vacate it in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The EEOC is currently investigating three sexual harassment charges filed against Astra.  At least two of these charges allege class-wide improprieties.  The controversy before us arose when the Commission found its investigation hampered by certain settlement agreements entered into between Astra and sundry employees who theretofore had pursued sexual harassment claims.  The problem first surfaced when an EEOC investigator, Brenda Choresi Carter, spoke with a former Astra employee on May 7, 1996.  According to Carter, the employee stated that she possessed relevant information but was unable to disclose it \"due to a confidential settlement agreement that she had entered into with Astra.\"   Although this conversation supplies the EEOC's most concrete proof that Astra's settlement agreements are hindering its probe, the Commission also points to other evidence hinting that the agreements may be stifling potential sources.  One employee who expressed reluctance about speaking with an EEOC investigator refused to say whether she had entered into a settlement agreement.  Then, too, when the EEOC contacted ninety employees and requested information, only twenty-six replied.  Although the Commission finds this widespread unresponsiveness to be sinister, its cause is unproven.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is the extent of the hard evidence as to the impact of the settlement agreements on the EEOC's investigation.  In all events, the Commission has not unleashed its subpoena power, see 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-9 (1994) (incorporating by reference 29 U.S.C. &#167; 161), to compel any recalcitrant employee to furnish relevant information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record reveals that Astra has entered into at least eleven settlement agreements--the exact number remains uncertain--with employees who claimed to have been subjected to, or to have witnessed, sexual harassment.  The details of these agreements vary, but they all contain versions of four provisions that are relevant to the disposition of this appeal.  First, the settling employee agrees not to file a charge with the EEOC.  Second, the settling employee agrees not to assist others who file charges with the EEOC.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Third, the settling employee releases all employment-related claims against Astra and those in privity with Astra (including Astra's management).  Fourth, the settling employee assents to a confidentiality regime under which she is barred from discussing the incident(s) that gave rise to her claim and from disclosing the terms of her settlement agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the EEOC learned of Astra's artful draftsmanship, it asked the company to rescind those portions of the settlement agreements that prohibited individuals from filing charges with the Commission (\"non-filing provisions\") and from aiding the Commission's investigations (\"non-assistance provisions\").  Astra defended both the non-filing and the non-assistance provisions but added that it \"do[es] not interpret any settlement agreement as preventing any ... employee from communicating with the EEOC concerning any of its investigations.\"   Astra's concession on the right of settling employees to communicate with the Commission remains somewhat tenebrous:  at oral argument, the company's counsel suggested that employees must await a subpoena before sharing information with the EEOC.  At any rate, Astra steadfastly maintains that employees who have signed settlement agreements may not volunteer any information to the Commission that is beyond the scope of an ongoing investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dissatisfied with Astra's response, the EEOC filed suit seeking injunctive relief pursuant to section 706(f)(2) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(f)(2).  Without convening an evidentiary hearing, the district court granted the request for a preliminary injunction and enjoined Astra for the time being \"from entering into or enforcing provisions of any Settlement Agreements which prohibit current or former employees from filing charges with the EEOC and/or assisting the Commission in its investigation of any charges.\"  EEOC v. Astra U.S.A., Inc., 929 F.Supp. 512, 521 (D.Mass.1996).  The court also directed Astra to \"provide a copy of this injunction to all current and former employees who have signed Settlement Agreements to assure them of notification of their rights set forth herein.\"  Id.  Astra appealed and requested interim relief.  We stayed the operation of the injunction (subject to certain conditions not relevant here) and expedited appellate proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first delineate certain legal standards (a task that, in this instance, requires us to resolve a threshold question).  We then evaluate the injunction as it affects the non-assistance and non-filing provisions, respectively.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>A. The Applicable Preliminary Injunction Standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the typical case, a party seeking preliminary injunctive relief must prove:  (1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits;  (2) a significant risk of irreparable harm if the injunction is withheld;  (3) a favorable balance of hardships;  and (4) a fit (or, at least, a lack of friction) between the injunction and the public interest.  See Narragansett Indian Tribe v. Guilbert, 934 F.2d 4, 5 (1st Cir.1991).  Here, however, the EEOC asserts that Congress, by enacting section 706(f)(2) of Title VII, specifically authorized the agency to seek injunctive relief in the public interest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Based on this circumstance, the EEOC argues that it need not satisfy the traditional test for preliminary injunctive relief but, instead, must only meet the built-in criterion that section 706(f)(2) itself establishes.  On this approach an injunction is appropriate as long as the Commission, after conducting a preliminary investigation of a pending charge of discrimination, (1) determines that prompt judicial intervention is essential to carry out the purposes of Title VII, and (2) makes out a prima facie case that the defendant has committed (or is likely to commit) serious violations of Title VII which, if not enjoined, will frustrate the Act's purposes.  In practice, the difference between the two approaches may be more apparent than real.  The EEOC, however, sees two key distinctions:  under its approach the public interest prong becomes a foregone conclusion (for the Commission is itself the standard-bearer for the public interest), and, in addition, a somewhat lessened showing of irreparable harm may be adequate to justify preliminary injunctive relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circuits are in some disarray regarding whether the EEOC must meet the traditional four-part test for injunctive relief. See, e.g., Baker v. Buckeye Cellulose Corp., 856 F.2d 167, 169 (11th Cir.1988) (holding that an allegation of a Title VII violation establishes a rebuttable presumption of irreparable injury);  EEOC v. Pacific Press Pub. Ass'n, 535 F.2d 1182, 1187 (9th Cir.1976) (suggesting that \"the usual requirement of irreparable injury is relaxed\" when the EEOC seeks injunctive relief pendente lite );  cf. EEOC v. Cosmair, Inc., 821 F.2d 1085, 1090 (5th Cir.1987) (holding, in an ADEA case, that \"[w]hen an injunction is expressly authorized by statute and the statutory conditions are satisfied, the movant need not establish specific irreparable injury to obtain a preliminary injunction\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Amidst these subtly shaded solutions, the Sixth Circuit struck a blow for clarity and flatly rejected the EEOC's interpretation of section 706(f)(2).  See EEOC v. Anchor Hocking Corp., 666 F.2d 1037, 1040-41 (6th Cir.1981).  We think that this is the right result.  There is nothing in the language of section 706(f)(2) that can fairly be read to limit a district court's discretion in issuing preliminary injunctions.  In authorizing the EEOC to \"bring an action for appropriate temporary or preliminary relief,\" the statute does not purport to wrest the final decision on whether relief is warranted from the courts.  See id. at 1041 &amp; n. 4 (comparing &#167; 706(f)(2) with other federal statutes which by their language restrict the district courts' discretion in issuing injunctions).  Moreover, this court has consistently emphasized the importance of a showing of irreparable harm in the calculus of injunctive relief.  See, e.g., Gately v. Commonwealth of Mass., 2 F.3d 1221, 1232 (1st Cir.1993) (stating that \"a federal court cannot dispense with the irreparable harm requirement in affording injunctive relief\"), cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1082, 114 S.Ct. 1832, 128 L.Ed.2d 461 (1994).  In our view this principle, which is predicated on the teaching that \"[t]he basis of injunctive relief in the federal courts has always been irreparable harm and inadequacy of legal remedies,\" Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500, 506-07, 79 S.Ct. 948, 954, 3 L.Ed.2d 988 (1959), is of paramount importance and should not lightly be set aside.  Because we see no evidence in this instance that Congress, in drafting section 706(f)(2), intended the courts to depart from this rule, we hold that the EEOC--like any other suitor--must meet the familiar four-part test for preliminary injunctive relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's grant of a preliminary injunction for mistake of law or abuse of discretion.  See Narragansett Indian Tribe, 934 F.2d at 5;  Independent Oil &amp; Chem.  Workers of Quincy, Inc. v. Procter &amp; Gamble Mfg. Co., 864 F.2d 927, 929 (1st Cir.1988).  A party appealing from either the grant or the denial of a preliminary injunction bears the considerable burden of demonstrating that the district court flouted this standard.  See Gately, 2 F.3d at 1225.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>B. Non-Assistance Agreements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With these principles in mind, we turn to those provisions of the settlement agreements that prohibit employees from aiding the EEOC in its investigation of charges.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Astra objects to the portion of the injunction that bans it from either introducing or enforcing these provisions on two grounds.  First, it claims that the injunction issued without a satisfactory showing of irreparable harm.  Second, it claims that the injunction is unnecessary because it now interprets the settlement agreements to permit various types of communication with the EEOC.  Both claims lack force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining whether the district court was justified in finding a significant risk of irreparable harm, we first note that when the likelihood of success on the merits is great, a movant can show somewhat less in the way of irreparable harm and still garner preliminary injunctive relief.  See Michigan Coalition of Radioactive Material Users, Inc. v. Griepentrog, 945 F.2d 150, 153 (6th Cir.1991) (\"Simply stated, more of one excuses less of the other.\");  Maram v. Universidad Interamericana De Puerto Rico, Inc., 722 F.2d 953, 958 (1st Cir.1983) (stating that \"these interests must be weighed inter sese\");  see also John Leubsdorf, The Standard for Preliminary Injunctions, 91 Harv.L.Rev. 525, passim (1978).  Thus, we start this phase of our inquiry by addressing whether a broad non-assistance agreement is void as against public policy.  If it is overwhelmingly clear that the provisions prohibiting settlors from assisting in EEOC investigations offend public policy, a lesser showing that those provisions are causing irreparable harm will suffice to support a preliminary injunction barring their enforcement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We build on bedrock.  \"[A] promise is unenforceable if the interest in its enforcement is outweighed in the circumstances by a public policy harmed by enforcement of the agreement.\"  Town of Newton v. Rumery, 480 U.S. 386, 392, 107 S.Ct. 1187, 1191, 94 L.Ed.2d 405 (1987).  In performing that balancing here, we must weigh the impact of settlement provisions that effectively bar cooperation with the EEOC on the enforcement of Title VII against the impact that outlawing such provisions would have on private dispute resolution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress entrusted the Commission with significant enforcement responsibilities in respect to Title VII.  See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(a).  To fulfill the core purposes of the statutory scheme, \"it is crucial that the Commission's ability to investigate charges of systemic discrimination not be impaired.\"  EEOC v. Shell Oil Co., 466 U.S. 54, 69, 104 S.Ct. 1621, 1631, 80 L.Ed.2d 41 (1984).  Clearly, if victims of or witnesses to sexual harassment are unable to approach the EEOC or even to answer its questions, the investigatory powers that Congress conferred would be sharply curtailed and the efficacy of investigations would be severely hampered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What is more, the EEOC acts not only on behalf of private parties but also \"to vindicate the public interest in preventing employment discrimination.\"  General Tel. Co. v. EEOC, 446 U.S. 318, 326, 100 S.Ct. 1698, 1704, 64 L.Ed.2d 319 (1980).  In many cases of widespread discrimination, victims suffer in silence.  In such instances, a sprinkling of settlement agreements that contain stipulations prohibiting cooperation with the EEOC could effectively thwart an agency investigation.  Thus, any agreement that materially interferes with communication between an employee and the Commission sows the seeds of harm to the public interest.  See Cosmair, 821 F.2d at 1090 (stating that \"an employer and an employee cannot agree to deny to the EEOC the information it needs to advance this public interest\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To complete the balance we must next address what impact the injunction against non-assistance covenants might have on private dispute resolution.  We do not doubt that public policy strongly favors encouraging voluntary settlement of employment discrimination claims.  See, e.g., Carson v. American Brands, Inc., 450 U.S. 79, 88 n. 14, 101 S.Ct. 993, 998 n. 14, 67 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981).  Yet we fail to see that this portion of the injunction creates a substantial disincentive to settlement, and Astra makes no plausible argument to the contrary.  Simply put, this monition does nothing at all to promote further litigation between Astra and the settling employee or to disturb the finality of the negotiated settlement.  Thus, weighing the significant public interest in encouraging communication with the EEOC against the minimal adverse impact that opening the channels of communication would have on settlement, we agree wholeheartedly with the lower court that non-assistance covenants which prohibit communication with the EEOC are void as against public policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now return to Astra's principal assertion:  that, because the EEOC could obtain the information it seeks through the use of its subpoena power, there is no evidence of irreparable harm and, hence, no basis for fashioning the disputed segment of the injunction.  This boils down to a contention that employees who have signed settlement agreements should speak only when spoken to.  We reject such a repressive construct.  It would be most peculiar to insist that the EEOC resort to its subpoena power when public policy so clearly favors the free flow of information between victims of harassment and the agency entrusted with righting the wrongs inflicted upon them.  Such a protocol would not only stultify investigations but also significantly increase the time and expense of a probe.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the district court specifically found a likelihood of irreparable harm \"because the Commission's ability to investigate charges of discrimination and to enforce anti-discrimination laws has been and continues to be impeded by the chilling effect caused by the offending provisions of the Agreements.\"  Astra, 929 F.Supp. at 520.   Given Carter's affidavit and the likely effect of the wording that Astra inserted into the settlement agreements, see supra note 2, we think that this finding is supportable.  Thus, there is a sufficient risk of irremediable harm to warrant the issuance of a preliminary injunction addressed to the non-assistance provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Astra further argues that an injunction is inappropriate because it does not interpret the settlement agreements as barring communication with the EEOC.  This argument is doubly flawed.  In the first place, Astra admits only that settlors may answer questions when subpoenaed by the EEOC, and that is much too narrow a concession.  In the second place, Astra cannot defeat an injunction now by indulging in a revisionist interpretation of the settlement agreements that would permit full and open communication with the EEOC.  \"It is the duty of the courts to beware of efforts to defeat injunctive relief by protestations of repentance and reform, especially when abandonment seems timed to anticipate suit....\"  United States v. Oregon State Medical Soc'y, 343 U.S. 326, 333, 72 S.Ct. 690, 695, 96 L.Ed. 978 (1952);  accord Chang v. Univ. of R.I., 606 F.Supp. 1161, 1275 (D.R.I.1985).  Here, Astra drafted aggressive settlement agreements under which employees pledged \"not to assist in any way\" in proceedings against it.  The district court supportably found that these agreements had in fact chilled communications between the settling employees and the EEOC.  Astra's attempts to reinterpret the operative provisions of its agreements when under siege come too late to prevent the issuance of an injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not add hues to the rainbow.  The district court neither misperceived the law nor misused its discretion in enjoining the utilization of settlement provisions that prohibit employees from assisting the EEOC in investigating charges of discrimination.  Consequently, employees who have signed such settlement agreements may respond to questions from EEOC investigators and also may volunteer information concerning sexual harassment at Astra to the EEOC.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>C. Non-Filing Agreements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to enjoining Astra from entering into or enforcing the non-assistance provisions of the settlement agreements, the district court also enjoined Astra from entering into or enforcing those provisions that ban employees from filing charges with the EEOC.  Astra assigns error.  It argues, inter alia, that public policy favors the enforcement of such covenants;  that the EEOC will not suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction;  and that the restraint exceeds the bounds authorized under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(f)(2).  Because we agree that the EEOC has made no showing that it will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of this portion of the injunction, we decline to reach Astra's other claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our analysis of this issue does not evolve from an exploration of the relation between irreparable harm and likelihood of success on the merits.  That inquiry is most utilitarian in instances in which the issue is whether the degree of harm is sufficient to warrant injunctive relief.  See, e.g., supra Part II(B).  Here, however, there is no significant risk of irreparable harm--and that fact alone is dispositive.  See Gately, 2 F.3d at 1232.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion rests on the role that the filing of a charge plays in the statutory scheme.  The EEOC has no authority to conduct an investigation based on hunch or suspicion, no matter how plausible that hunch or suspicion may be.  The reverse is true:  the Commission's power to investigate is dependent upon the filing of a charge of discrimination.  \"[U]nlike other federal agencies that possess plenary authority to demand to see records relevant to matters within their jurisdiction, the EEOC is entitled to access only to evidence 'relevant to the charge under investigation.' \"  Shell Oil, 466 U.S. at 64, 104 S.Ct. at 1629 (quoting statute).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once a charge is filed with the EEOC, the situation changes dramatically.  The allegations contained in the charge do not narrowly circumscribe the Commission's investigation.  Rather, the charge serves as \"a jurisdictional springboard\" enabling the Commission \"to investigate whether the employer is engaged in any discriminatory practices.\"  EEOC v. Huttig Sash &amp; Door Co., 511 F.2d 453, 455 (5th Cir.1975).  So viewed, the charge is capable of supporting an EEOC investigation into both the discrimination described in the charge itself and into the surrounding circumstances (including a full probing of any evidence of discriminatory practices unearthed during the course of the initial investigation).  See EEOC v. General Elec. Co., 532 F.2d 359, 366 (4th Cir.1976).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given this set of rules, the EEOC's claim of irreparable harm cannot withstand scrutiny.  The EEOC is already investigating three charges against Astra, two of which allege class-wide sexual harassment in the workplace.  These charges provide the EEOC with jurisdiction to conduct a thorough investigation into incidents of sexual harassment, invidious practices, and other prohibited conduct that may have occurred at Astra over time.  Additionally, the portion of the injunction that prevents the enforcement of the settlement agreements' non-assistance provisions--a portion of the injunction that we uphold, see supra Part II(B)--ensures that employees will be able to cooperate freely with the EEOC's investigators.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that, once an injunction issues prohibiting Astra from enforcing the non-assistance covenants, this case offers no prospect of irreparable harm to the EEOC.  Thus, the judicial restraint that the district court imposed against enforcement of the non-filing covenants violates the tenet that \"injunctive relief should be no more burdensome to the defendant than necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs.\"  Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702, 99 S.Ct. 2545, 2558, 61 L.Ed.2d 176 (1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is an especially attractive candidate for application of the Yamasaki doctrine.  The difficult, highly ramified questions that surround the validity of non-filing covenants counsel persuasively against reaching out past what is required during the preliminary injunction phase.  Consequently, we believe it was inadvisable--and legally incorrect--for the district court, on the sparse evidence contained in this record, to attempt to confront the thorny question of whether agreements not to file charges with the EEOC are void as against public policy.  Courts should take care not to yearn for the blossom when only the bud is ready.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to coax a different result, the EEOC bemoans the increased burden that it would face if it had to compel potential witnesses' cooperation by subpoena.  As applied to this portion of the preliminary injunction, the Commission's asseveration is a non sequitur.  As long as enforcement of the non-assistance covenants is enjoined, the EEOC's current investigations will not be impeded even if settling parties cannot file additional charges.  And as we have already noted, those investigations are sufficiently broad in scope to permit the Commission to get to the bottom of the unsavory (but, as yet, unproven) allegations that are swirling around the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, we are cognizant of the possibility that additional charges filed with the EEOC perhaps could serve as a basis to expand the temporal scope of the ongoing investigations.  Thus, the non-filing covenants, if left undisturbed, theoretically could limit the claims of some class members against Astra, and this limitation might in turn provide a basis for a finding of irreparable harm.  But that is sheer speculation on this exiguous record.  Absent any hard evidence that anyone who signed a settlement agreement with Astra now seeks to press charges with the EEOC which, if filed, would expand the investigations' scope, the disputed portion of the injunction is unwarranted.  If the EEOC's investigations subsequently reveal that such a situation actually exists, that is the time to renew the quest for an injunction against enforcement of the non-filing provisions contained in Astra's settlement agreements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  The EEOC will receive full relief from that portion of the district court's injunction which restrains Astra from entering into or enforcing the non-assistance provisions of its settlement agreements.  We therefore affirm that portion of the injunction, vacate the portion enjoining Astra from entering into or enforcing non-filing covenants in connection with those agreements, and remand for the entry of a revised decree consistent herewith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.  The stay previously granted is dissolved.

It is unnecessary to distinguish between these two groups for purposes of this appeal.  Consequently, we use the collective noun--\"employees\"--to encompass both past and present employees</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> While the precise phraseology of the non-filing and non-assistance covenants varies from pact to pact, the import is the same.  By way of illustration, a representative agreement contains a covenant binding the settling employee \"not to file or to assist in any way anyone else who files any claim, complaint, or charge nor institute any lawsuit against ASTRA, its officers, directors, agents, or employees arising out of her employment or termination of employment with ASTRA, including, but not limited to, any claim, complaint, charge, or lawsuit under the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Americans with Disabilities Act, the Massachusetts Fair Employment Practice Act, any other federal or state law or statute, or any claim which could be alleged under the common law.\"   In another iteration, some settlement agreements confirm that the settling party will not \"voluntarily provide any assistance\" to persons asserting claims against Astra</p>\n        <p>While the non-assistance provisions have two facets--they purport to bar assistance to both the EEOC and fellow employees--the Commission so far has challenged only that facet of the non-assistance provisions which purports to prevent settling employees from communicating with the Commission.  Since the EEOC has not yet objected to that part of the non-assistance provisions which precludes a settling employee from aiding another employee in preferring a claim against Astra, we take no view of that aspect of the matter.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The statute provides in material part:</p>\n        <p>Whenever a charge is filed with the Commission and the Commission concludes on the basis of a preliminary investigation that prompt judicial action is necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act, the Commission ... may bring an action for appropriate temporary or preliminary relief pending final disposition of such charge.</p>\n        <p>42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(f)(2).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Although the precise terms of the settlement agreements vary, see supra note 2 &amp; accompanying text, we think that many settling parties would interpret these provisions, however they may be couched, as barring them from volunteering information to the EEOC or cooperating with its investigators</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Cosmair arose under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 621-634 (1994), and Astra asserts that it is inapposite here because unsupervised settlement agreements that waive employees' claims are more suspect under the ADEA than under Title VII.  This assertion is based on a fundamental misunderstanding.  The right to assist the EEOC is not a damages-driven right.  Indeed, the court below specifically held that settling employees had waived the right to recover damages in either their own lawsuits or in lawsuits brought by the EEOC on their behalf.  See Astra, 929 F.Supp. at 521.   In contrast to the individual right to recover damages, however, an employee's right to communicate with the EEOC must be protected not to safeguard the settling employee's entitlement to recompense but instead to safeguard the public interest.  Hence, it is not a right that an employer can purchase from an employee, nor is it a right that an employee can sell to her employer.  Thus, a waiver of the right to assist the EEOC offends public policy under both the ADEA and Title VII</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Though the injunction does not specifically address the confidentiality covenants to which the settlement agreements are subject, the terms of the injunction forbid Astra from enforcing any contractual provisions that impede settling employees from assisting the EEOC in ongoing investigations.  Thus, the injunction effectively precludes enforcement of the confidentiality covenants to block the divulgement of relevant information (including divulgement of the entire contents of any particular settlement agreement) to the Commission.  We need not probe this point more deeply, because Astra now interprets the confidentiality language as inapplicable to communications between settling employees and the EEOC relevant to an ongoing investigation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> We take no view today of the validity vel non of non-filing covenants.  The question is close and the answer is not obvious to us.  On one hand, a charge is sometimes a prerequisite to action in the public interest by the EEOC;  that consideration argues for abrogating such covenants.  On the other hand, if non-filing agreements are unenforceable, private settlement of harassment claims will be hindered significantly and employers seeking finality may well insist that employees file charges with the EEOC as a precondition to any settlement;  this consideration argues for upholding such covenants.  All in all, we conclude that trying to resolve the tension between these laudable but competing goals in a case in which no discernible need for the requested relief exists and no fully developed factual record is available courts potential mischief</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

(\"Astra\" or \"the company\") challenges a preliminary injunction restraining it from entering into or enforcing settlement agreements containing provisions that prohibit settling employees both from filing charges of sexual harassment with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\" or \"the Commission\") and from assisting the Commission in its investigation of any such charges.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  For the reasons that follow, we affirm the preliminary injunction in part and vacate it in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The EEOC is currently investigating three sexual harassment charges filed against Astra.  At least two of these charges allege class-wide improprieties.  The controversy before us arose when the Commission found its investigation hampered by certain settlement agreements entered into between Astra and sundry employees who theretofore had pursued sexual harassment claims.  The problem first surfaced when an EEOC investigator, Brenda Choresi Carter, spoke with a former Astra employee on May 7, 1996.  According to Carter, the employee stated that she possessed relevant information but was unable to disclose it \"due to a confidential settlement agreement that she had entered into with Astra.\"   Although this conversation supplies the EEOC's most concrete proof that Astra's settlement agreements are hindering its probe, the Commission also points to other evidence hinting that the agreements may be stifling potential sources.  One employee who expressed reluctance about speaking with an EEOC investigator refused to say whether she had entered into a settlement agreement.  Then, too, when the EEOC contacted ninety employees and requested information, only twenty-six replied.  Although the Commission finds this widespread unresponsiveness to be sinister, its cause is unproven.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is the extent of the hard evidence as to the impact of the settlement agreements on the EEOC's investigation.  In all events, the Commission has not unleashed its subpoena power, see 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-9 (1994) (incorporating by reference 29 U.S.C. &#167; 161), to compel any recalcitrant employee to furnish relevant information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record reveals that Astra has entered into at least eleven settlement agreements--the exact number remains uncertain--with employees who claimed to have been subjected to, or to have witnessed, sexual harassment.  The details of these agreements vary, but they all contain versions of four provisions that are relevant to the disposition of this appeal.  First, the settling employee agrees not to file a charge with the EEOC.  Second, the settling employee agrees not to assist others who file charges with the EEOC.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Third, the settling employee releases all employment-related claims against Astra and those in privity with Astra (including Astra's management).  Fourth, the settling employee assents to a confidentiality regime under which she is barred from discussing the incident(s) that gave rise to her claim and from disclosing the terms of her settlement agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the EEOC learned of Astra's artful draftsmanship, it asked the company to rescind those portions of the settlement agreements that prohibited individuals from filing charges with the Commission (\"non-filing provisions\") and from aiding the Commission's investigations (\"non-assistance provisions\").  Astra defended both the non-filing and the non-assistance provisions but added that it \"do[es] not interpret any settlement agreement as preventing any ... employee from communicating with the EEOC concerning any of its investigations.\"   Astra's concession on the right of settling employees to communicate with the Commission remains somewhat tenebrous:  at oral argument, the company's counsel suggested that employees must await a subpoena before sharing information with the EEOC.  At any rate, Astra steadfastly maintains that employees who have signed settlement agreements may not volunteer any information to the Commission that is beyond the scope of an ongoing investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dissatisfied with Astra's response, the EEOC filed suit seeking injunctive relief pursuant to section 706(f)(2) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(f)(2).  Without convening an evidentiary hearing, the district court granted the request for a preliminary injunction and enjoined Astra for the time being \"from entering into or enforcing provisions of any Settlement Agreements which prohibit current or former employees from filing charges with the EEOC and/or assisting the Commission in its investigation of any charges.\"  EEOC v. Astra U.S.A., Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">929</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">512</span></span>, 521 (D.Mass.1996).  The court also directed Astra to \"provide a copy of this injunction to all current and former employees who have signed Settlement Agreements to assure them of notification of their rights set forth herein.\"  Id.

See Narragansett Indian Tribe v. Guilbert, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"561828\"><a href=\"/opinion/561828/narragansett-indian-tribe-v-paul-e-guilbert/\"><span class=\"volume\">934</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.1991).  Here, however, the EEOC asserts that Congress, by enacting section 706(f)(2) of Title VII, specifically authorized the agency to seek injunctive relief in the public interest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Based on this circumstance, the EEOC argues that it need not satisfy the traditional test for preliminary injunctive relief but, instead, must only meet the built-in criterion that section 706(f)(2) itself establishes.  On this approach an injunction is appropriate as long as the Commission, after conducting a preliminary investigation of a pending charge of discrimination, (1) determines that prompt judicial intervention is essential to carry out the purposes of Title VII, and (2) makes out a prima facie case that the defendant has committed (or is likely to commit) serious violations of Title VII which, if not enjoined, will frustrate the Act's purposes.  In practice, the difference between the two approaches may be more apparent than real.  The EEOC, however, sees two key distinctions:  under its approach the public interest prong becomes a foregone conclusion (for the Commission is itself the standard-bearer for the public interest), and, in addition, a somewhat lessened showing of irreparable harm may be adequate to justify preliminary injunctive relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circuits are in some disarray regarding whether the EEOC must meet the traditional four-part test for injunctive relief.

We think that this is the right result.  There is nothing in the language of section 706(f)(2) that can fairly be read to limit a district court's discretion in issuing preliminary injunctions.  In authorizing the EEOC to \"bring an action for appropriate temporary or preliminary relief,\" the statute does not purport to wrest the final decision on whether relief is warranted from the courts.  See id. at 1041 &amp; n. 4 (comparing &#167; 706(f)(2) with other federal statutes which by their language restrict the district courts' discretion in issuing injunctions).  Moreover, this court has consistently emphasized the importance of a showing of irreparable harm in the calculus of injunctive relief.  See, e.g., Gately v.

Thus, we start this phase of our inquiry by addressing whether a broad non-assistance agreement is void as against public policy.

In such instances, a sprinkling of settlement agreements that contain stipulations prohibiting cooperation with the EEOC could effectively thwart an agency investigation.  Thus, any agreement that materially interferes with communication between an employee and the Commission sows the seeds of harm to the public interest.  See Cosmair, 821 F.2d at 1090 (stating that \"an employer and an employee cannot agree to deny to the EEOC the information it needs to advance this public interest\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To complete the balance we must next address what impact the injunction against non-assistance covenants might have on private dispute resolution.  We do not doubt that public policy strongly favors encouraging voluntary settlement of employment discrimination claims.  See, e.g., Carson v. American Brands, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110416\"><a href=\"/opinion/110416/carson-v-american-brands-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span>, 88 n. 14, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110416\"><a href=\"/opinion/110416/carson-v-american-brands-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span> (1981).  Yet we fail to see that this portion of the injunction creates a substantial disincentive to settlement, and Astra makes no plausible argument to the contrary.  Simply put, this monition does nothing at all to promote further litigation between Astra and the settling employee or to disturb the finality of the negotiated settlement.  Thus, weighing the significant public interest in encouraging communication with the EEOC against the minimal adverse impact that opening the channels of communication would have on settlement, we agree wholeheartedly with the lower court that non-assistance covenants which prohibit communication with the EEOC are void as against public policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now return to Astra's principal assertion:  that, because the EEOC could obtain the information it seeks through the use of its subpoena power, there is no evidence of irreparable harm and, hence, no basis for fashioning the disputed segment of the injunction.  This boils down to a contention that employees who have signed settlement agreements should speak only when spoken to.  We reject such a repressive construct.  It would be most peculiar to insist that the EEOC resort to its subpoena power when public policy so clearly favors the free flow of information between victims of harassment and the agency entrusted with righting the wrongs inflicted upon them.  Such a protocol would not only stultify investigations but also significantly increase the time and expense of a probe.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the district court specifically found a likelihood of irreparable harm \"because the Commission's ability to investigate charges of discrimination and to enforce anti-discrimination laws has been and continues to be impeded by the chilling effect caused by the offending provisions of the Agreements.\"  Astra, 929 F.Supp. at 520.   Given Carter's affidavit and the likely effect of the wording that Astra inserted into the settlement agreements, see supra note 2, we think that this finding is supportable.  Thus, there is a sufficient risk of irremediable harm to warrant the issuance of a preliminary injunction addressed to the non-assistance provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Astra further argues that an injunction is inappropriate because it does not interpret the settlement agreements as barring communication with the EEOC.  This argument is doubly flawed.  In the first place, Astra admits only that settlors may answer questions when subpoenaed by the EEOC, and that is much too narrow a concession.  In the second place, Astra cannot defeat an injunction now by indulging in a revisionist interpretation of the settlement agreements that would permit full and open communication with the EEOC.  \"It is the duty of the courts to beware of efforts to defeat injunctive relief by protestations of repentance and reform, especially when abandonment seems timed to anticipate suit....\"  United States v.

Here, Astra drafted aggressive settlement agreements under which employees pledged \"not to assist in any way\" in proceedings against it.  The district court supportably found that these agreements had in fact chilled communications between the settling employees and the EEOC.  Astra's attempts to reinterpret the operative provisions of its agreements when under siege come too late to prevent the issuance of an injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not add hues to the rainbow.  The district court neither misperceived the law nor misused its discretion in enjoining the utilization of settlement provisions that prohibit employees from assisting the EEOC in investigating charges of discrimination.  Consequently, employees who have signed such settlement agreements may respond to questions from EEOC investigators and also may volunteer information concerning sexual harassment at Astra to the EEOC.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>C.

Astra assigns error.  It argues, inter alia, that public policy favors the enforcement of such covenants;  that the EEOC will not suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction;  and that the restraint exceeds the bounds authorized under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(f)(2).  Because we agree that the EEOC has made no showing that it will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of this portion of the injunction, we decline to reach Astra's other claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our analysis of this issue does not evolve from an exploration of the relation between irreparable harm and likelihood of success on the merits.  That inquiry is most utilitarian in instances in which the issue is whether the degree of harm is sufficient to warrant injunctive relief.  See, e.g., supra Part II(B).  Here, however, there is no significant risk of irreparable harm--and that fact alone is dispositive.  See Gately, 2 F.3d at 1232.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion rests on the role that the filing of a charge plays in the statutory scheme.  The EEOC has no authority to conduct an investigation based on hunch or suspicion, no matter how plausible that hunch or suspicion may be.  The reverse is true:  the Commission's power to investigate is dependent upon the filing of a charge of discrimination.  \"[U]nlike other federal agencies that possess plenary authority to demand to see records relevant to matters within their jurisdiction, the EEOC is entitled to access only to evidence 'relevant to the charge under investigation.' \"  Shell Oil, 466 U.S. at 64, 104 S.Ct. at 1629 (quoting statute).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once a charge is filed with the EEOC, the situation changes dramatically.  The allegations contained in the charge do not narrowly circumscribe the Commission's investigation.  Rather, the charge serves as \"a jurisdictional springboard\" enabling the Commission \"to investigate whether the employer is engaged in any discriminatory practices.\"  EEOC v. Huttig Sash &amp; Door Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"325503\"><a href=\"/opinion/325503/10-fair-emplpraccas-529-9-empl-prac-dec-p-10065-equal-employment/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">453</span></a></span>, 455 (5th Cir.1975).  So viewed, the charge is capable of supporting an EEOC investigation into both the discrimination described in the charge itself and into the surrounding circumstances (including a full probing of any evidence of discriminatory practices unearthed during the course of the initial investigation).  See EEOC v. General Elec. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"334151\"><a href=\"/opinion/334151/12-fair-emplpraccas-21-11-empl-prac-dec-p-10627-equal-employment/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">359</span></a></span>, 366 (4th Cir.1976).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given this set of rules, the EEOC's claim of irreparable harm cannot withstand scrutiny.  The EEOC is already investigating three charges against Astra, two of which allege class-wide sexual harassment in the workplace.  These charges provide the EEOC with jurisdiction to conduct a thorough investigation into incidents of sexual harassment, invidious practices, and other prohibited conduct that may have occurred at Astra over time.  Additionally, the portion of the injunction that prevents the enforcement of the settlement agreements' non-assistance provisions--a portion of the injunction that we uphold, see supra Part II(B)--ensures that employees will be able to cooperate freely with the EEOC's investigators.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that, once an injunction issues prohibiting Astra from enforcing the non-assistance covenants, this case offers no prospect of irreparable harm to the EEOC.  Thus, the judicial restraint that the district court imposed against enforcement of the non-filing covenants violates the tenet that \"injunctive relief should be no more burdensome to the defendant than necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs.\"  Califano v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span> (1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is an especially attractive candidate for application of the Yamasaki doctrine.  The difficult, highly ramified questions that surround the validity of non-filing covenants counsel persuasively against reaching out past what is required during the preliminary injunction phase.  Consequently, we believe it was inadvisable--and legally incorrect--for the district court, on the sparse evidence contained in this record, to attempt to confront the thorny question of whether agreements not to file charges with the EEOC are void as against public policy.  Courts should take care not to yearn for the blossom when only the bud is ready.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to coax a different result, the EEOC bemoans the increased burden that it would face if it had to compel potential witnesses' cooperation by subpoena.  As applied to this portion of the preliminary injunction, the Commission's asseveration is a non sequitur.  As long as enforcement of the non-assistance covenants is enjoined, the EEOC's current investigations will not be impeded even if settling parties cannot file additional charges.  And as we have already noted, those investigations are sufficiently broad in scope to permit the Commission to get to the bottom of the unsavory (but, as yet, unproven) allegations that are swirling around the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, we are cognizant of the possibility that additional charges filed with the EEOC perhaps could serve as a basis to expand the temporal scope of the ongoing investigations.  Thus, the non-filing covenants, if left undisturbed, theoretically could limit the claims of some class members against Astra, and this limitation might in turn provide a basis for a finding of irreparable harm.  But that is sheer speculation on this exiguous record.  Absent any hard evidence that anyone who signed a settlement agreement with Astra now seeks to press charges with the EEOC which, if filed, would expand the investigations' scope, the disputed portion of the injunction is unwarranted.  If the EEOC's investigations subsequently reveal that such a situation actually exists, that is the time to renew the quest for an injunction against enforcement of the non-filing provisions contained in Astra's settlement agreements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  The EEOC will receive full relief from that portion of the district court's injunction which restrains Astra from entering into or enforcing the non-assistance provisions of its settlement agreements.  We therefore affirm that portion of the injunction, vacate the portion enjoining Astra from entering into or enforcing non-filing covenants in connection with those agreements, and remand for the entry of a revised decree consistent herewith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.  The stay previously granted is dissolved.  Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The settlement agreements involve, and the district court's injunction covers, both employees and former employees of Astra.  It is unnecessary to distinguish between these two groups for purposes of this appeal.  Consequently, we use the collective noun--\"employees\"--to encompass both past and present employees</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> While the precise phraseology of the non-filing and non-assistance covenants varies from pact to pact, the import is the same.  By way of illustration, a representative agreement contains a covenant binding the settling employee \"not to file or to assist in any way anyone else who files any claim, complaint, or charge nor institute any lawsuit against ASTRA, its officers, directors, agents, or employees arising out of her employment or termination of employment with ASTRA, including, but not limited to, any claim, complaint, charge, or lawsuit under the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Americans with Disabilities Act, the Massachusetts Fair Employment Practice Act, any other federal or state law or statute, or any claim which could be alleged under the common law.\"   In another iteration, some settlement agreements confirm that the settling party will not \"voluntarily provide any assistance\" to persons asserting claims against Astra</p>\n        <p>While the non-assistance provisions have two facets--they purport to bar assistance to both the EEOC and fellow employees--the Commission so far has challenged only that facet of the non-assistance provisions which purports to prevent settling employees from communicating with the Commission.  Since the EEOC has not yet objected to that part of the non-assistance provisions which precludes a settling employee from aiding another employee in preferring a claim against Astra, we take no view of that aspect of the matter.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The statute provides in material part:</p>\n        <p>Whenever a charge is filed with the Commission and the Commission concludes on the basis of a preliminary investigation that prompt judicial action is necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act, the Commission ... may bring an action for appropriate temporary or preliminary relief pending final disposition of such charge.</p>\n        <p>42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(f)(2).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Although the precise terms of the settlement agreements vary, see supra note 2 &amp; accompanying text, we think that many settling parties would interpret these provisions, however they may be couched, as barring them from volunteering information to the EEOC or cooperating with its investigators</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Cosmair arose under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 621-634 (1994), and Astra asserts that it is inapposite here because unsupervised settlement agreements that waive employees' claims are more suspect under the ADEA than under Title VII.  This assertion is based on a fundamental misunderstanding.  The right to assist the EEOC is not a damages-driven right.  Indeed, the court below specifically held that settling employees had waived the right to recover damages in either their own lawsuits or in lawsuits brought by the EEOC on their behalf.  See Astra, 929 F.Supp. at 521.   In contrast to the individual right to recover damages, however, an employee's right to communicate with the EEOC must be protected not to safeguard the settling employee's entitlement to recompense but instead to safeguard the public interest.  Hence, it is not a right that an employer can purchase from an employee, nor is it a right that an employee can sell to her employer.  Thus, a waiver of the right to assist the EEOC offends public policy under both the ADEA and Title VII</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Though the injunction does not specifically address the confidentiality covenants to which the settlement agreements are subject, the terms of the injunction forbid Astra from enforcing any contractual provisions that impede settling employees from assisting the EEOC in ongoing investigations.  Thus, the injunction effectively precludes enforcement of the confidentiality covenants to block the divulgement of relevant information (including divulgement of the entire contents of any particular settlement agreement) to the Commission.  We need not probe this point more deeply, because Astra now interprets the confidentiality language as inapplicable to communications between settling employees and the EEOC relevant to an ongoing investigation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> We take no view today of the validity vel non of non-filing covenants.  The question is close and the answer is not obvious to us.  On one hand, a charge is sometimes a prerequisite to action in the public interest by the EEOC;  that consideration argues for abrogating such covenants.  On the other hand, if non-filing agreements are unenforceable, private settlement of harassment claims will be hindered significantly and employers seeking finality may well insist that employees file charges with the EEOC as a precondition to any settlement;  this consideration argues for upholding such covenants.  All in all, we conclude that trying to resolve the tension between these laudable but competing goals in a case in which no discernible need for the requested relief exists and no fully developed factual record is available courts potential mischief</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
