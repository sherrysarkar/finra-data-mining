In this proceeding, defendant-\r\n\nappellant Cecilio F. McDonald asks in the alternative (1) that we\r\n\nvacate his guilty plea because the district court failed to advise\r\n\nhim of the applicable mandatory minimum sentence during the plea\r\n\ncolloquy, or (2) that we set aside his sentence due to an alleged\r\n\nerror in the calculation of his adjusted offense level. Taking\r\n\nsecond things first, we find no computational error. And while\r\n\nMcDonald's first point is well-taken   we agree that the district\r\n\ncourt erred in failing to apprise the appellant of the mandatory\r\n\nminimum sentence, \r                           see Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1)   we find that this\r\n\nerror was benign. Consequently, we affirm the appellant's\r\n\nconviction and sentence.\r\n\n                               I.\r\n\n                           Background\r\n\n          On September 18, 1995, the authorities searched the\r\n\nappellant's one-bedroom apartment in Providence, Rhode Island,\r\n\npursuant to a warrant. They found a cornucopia of drugs, money,\r\n\nand drug-related paraphernalia hidden in the parlor: 160.32 grams\r\n\nof crack cocaine, 2,656.47 grams of marijuana, $16,050 in cash,\r\n\nthree digital scales, and two dust masks. They also found a 9mm\r\n\nsemi-automatic pistol and a plastic bag containing several live\r\n\nrounds in a secret compartment in the bathroom vanity.\r\n\n          A federal grand jury subsequently returned an indictment\r\n\ncharging the appellant with possessing fifty grams or more of\r\n\ncocaine base (crack), intending to distribute it, in violation of\r\n\n21 U.S.C. S 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A) (1994). In due course, the\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nappellant pleaded guilty to the charge. During the plea colloquy,\r\n\nthe district court questioned him extensively in order to ascertain\r\n\nthat his guilty plea was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. Yet\r\n\nthe court neglected to mention that, due to the amount of crack\r\n\ninvolved, the offense carried a mandatory minimum ten-year\r\n\nsentence.\r\n\n          Following standard practice, the district court\r\n\ncommissioned the preparation of a Presentence Investigation Report\r\n\n(PSI Report). In it, the probation department reported that the\r\n\namount of crack involved called for a base offense level (BOL) of\r\n\n36; recommended a series of adjustments to the BOL; hypothesized\r\n\nthat the appellant belonged in criminal history category III; and\r\n\nforecast a guideline sentencing range of 210-262 months. In two\r\n\nplaces, the PSI Report unambiguously declared that a mandatory\r\n\nminimum sentence of ten years applied. The appellant (who told the\r\n\ncourt at sentencing that he had been afforded an ample opportunity\r\n\nto read and digest the PSI Report) filed a covey of objections, but\r\n\nhe neither took issue with the applicability of the mandatory\r\n\nminimum sentence nor complained that its existence had previously\r\n\nbeen withheld from him.\r\n\n          At the disposition hearing, the district judge determined\r\n\nthat the BOL was 34, not 36. He made two adjustments, subtracting\r\n\nthree levels for acceptance of responsibility,   see USSG S3E1.1\r\n\n(1995), and adding two levels for possession of a firearm, \r                                                                   see USSG\r\n\nS2D1.1(b)(1) (1995). The court then concluded that the appellant\r\n\nbelonged in criminal history category I. These determinations\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nyielded a sentencing range of 135-168 months.  See USSG Ch.5, Pt.\r\n\nA (Sentencing Table) (adjusted offense level 33, criminal history\r\n\ncategory I). The judge thereupon imposed a 135-month incarcerative\r\n\nsentence. This appeal ensued.\r\n\n                               II.\r\n\n                           Discussion\r\n\n          We begin with the weapons enhancement, cognizant that the\r\n\npropriety vel non of that ruling may affect the harmless error\r\n\nanalysis which the appellant's principal assignment of error\r\n\nentails.\r\n\n                               A.\r\n\n                     The Weapons Enhancement\r\n\n          We review factual determinations made in the course of\r\n\nsentencing for clear error, mindful that such determinations need\r\n\nonly be supported by preponderant evidence.  See United States v.\r\n\nLagasse, 87 F.3d 18, 21 (1st Cir. 1996). Moreover, the district\r\n\ncourt's application of a relevant guideline to the facts of a given\r\n\ncase is a fact-sensitive matter that engenders clear-error review.\r\n\nSee United \r                     States v. Gonzalez-Vazquez, 34 F.3d 19, 24 (1st Cir.\r\n\n1994). Under these standards, we must uphold the weapons\r\n\nenhancement in this case.\r\n\n          There is no cause to tarry. A firearm is a \"dangerous\r\n\n     This is to be distinguished from questions anent the\r\ninterpretation or overall applicability of particular guidelines to\r\nparticular situations. Such questions are questions of law and are\r\ntherefore subject to de novo review.  See United States v. Muniz,\r\n49 F.3d 36, 41 (1st Cir. 1995).\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nweapon,\" and the relevant guideline instructs the sentencing court\r\n\nto increase the BOL by two levels if the defendant possessed \"a\r\n\ndangerous weapon.\" USSG S2D1.1(b)(1). The Sentencing Commission's\r\n\ncommentary and application notes weigh heavily in construing the\r\n\nguidelines, see  Stinson v.  United  \r                                              States, 508 U.S. 36, 42-46\r\n\n(1993); \r                 United States\r                               v. \r                                  Fiore, 983 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1992), and,\r\n\nin regard to this guideline, the Commission tells us that \"the\r\n\nadjustment should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it\r\n\nis clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the\r\n\noffense.\" USSG S2D1.1(b)(1), comment. (n.3). We have consistently\r\n\nhonored this advisory, \r                                see, \r                                     e.g., \r                                           Gonzalez-Vazquez, 34 F.3d at 24;\r\n\nUnited States v. Jackson, 3 F.3d 506, 509 (1st Cir. 1993); United\r\n\nStates v.  Ruiz, 905 F.2d 499, 507 (1st Cir. 1990), and the\r\n\nappellant has offered us no persuasive reason to repudiate it\r\n\ntoday.\r\n\n          Of course, a certain nexus between the weapon and the\r\n\noffense must be shown in order for the enhancement to lie.    See\r\n\nLagasse, 87 F.3d at 22. But to establish the link the prosecution\r\n\nneed only prove that the defendant possessed the weapon during the\r\n\ncurrency of the offense, not necessarily that he actually used it\r\n\nin perpetrating the crime or that he intended to do so.  See  id.\r\n\nFurthermore, a defendant need not have had the weapon on his person\r\n\nfor the enhancement to apply; any possession   actual or\r\n\nconstructive   can trigger the two-level increase.    See  United\r\n\nStates v. Hill, 79 F.3d 1477, 1485 (6th Cir. 1996). Thus, \"when\r\n\nthe weapon's location makes it readily available to protect either\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nthe participants themselves during the commission of the illegal\r\n\nactivity or the drugs and cash involved in the drug business, there\r\n\nwill be sufficient evidence to connect the weapons to the offense\r\n\nconduct.\"  United \r                            States v.  Corcimiglia, 967 F.2d 724, 727 (1st\r\n\nCir. 1992); \r                     accord \r                            Lagasse, 87 F.3d at 22; \r                                                   United States\r                                                                 v. \r                                                                    Ovalle-\r\n\nMarquez, 36 F.3d 212, 225 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\n\n          Here, the government satisfied its entry-level burden.\r\n\nIt showed that the appellant constructively possessed a weapon  \r\n\nafter all, the gun was found in the bathroom vanity of the home\r\n\nthat he alone occupied   and a reasonable factfinder could infer\r\n\nfrom the apartment's contents that the premises served as the\r\n\ncommand post for the appellant's drug-trafficking activities. In\r\n\nshort, the weapon, though hidden, was readily available to protect\r\n\nthe appellant, the cash, and the drugs that he kept on the\r\n\npremises.\r\n\n          Where, as here, the government has shown that a firearm\r\n\npossessed by the defendant was present during the commission of the\r\n\noffense, the burden shifts to the defendant to persuade the\r\n\nfactfinder that a connection between the weapon and the crime is\r\n\nclearly improbable.  See Jackson, 3 F.3d at 509. On this record,\r\n\nwe cannot fault the lower court for holding that the appellant\r\n\nfailed to carry this burden. To be sure, the appellant denied all\r\n\nknowledge of the gun. But he neither adduced any evidentiary\r\n\nsupport for this denial nor suggested an innocent explanation for\r\n\nthe gun's presence. Credibility calls are for the trier,     see,\r\n\ne.g., \r               United States\r                             v. \r                                St. Cyr\r                                       , 977 F.2d 698, 706 (1st Cir. 1992),\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nand Judge Pettine was not obliged to credit the appellant's\r\n\nunsupported disclaimer of guilty knowledge.\r\n\n          To summarize, we discern no clear error in the court's\r\n\nimposition of a two-level enhancement pursuant to USSG\r\n\nS2D1.1(b)(1).\r\n\n                               B.\r\n\n                      The Rule 11 Colloquy\r\n\n          We turn now to the appellant's principal claim   a claim\r\n\nthat makes its debut on appeal. In many instances, we will decline\r\n\nto entertain issues that were not seasonably advanced in the nisi\r\n\nprius court. However, a different rule sometimes obtains when a\r\n\ndefendant seeks for the first time to set aside his guilty plea in\r\n\nthe court of appeals.  See, e.g., United \r                                                   States v.  Parra-Ibanez,\r\n\n936 F.2d 588, 593 (1st Cir. 1991); see generally Fed. R. Crim. P.\r\n\n32(e). Here, the defendant's allegation implicates a core concern\r\n\nof Rule 11 and the record on appeal is adequately developed to\r\n\npermit direct review.  See United States v. Martinez-Martinez, 69\r\n\nF.3d 1215, 1219 (1st Cir. 1995),  cert. denied, 116 S. Ct. 1343\r\n\n(1996). Hence, we consider the appellant's argument.\r\n\n     When a defendant moves in the district court to withdraw a\r\nguilty plea, we usually test that motion by means of a set multi-\r\npart analysis. See \r                             United States\r                                           v. \r                                              Gonzalez-Vazquez, 34 F.3d 19,\r\n22-23 (1st Cir. 1994); United \r                                        States v. Parrilla-Tirado, 22 F.3d\r\n368, 371 (1st Cir. 1994). We have on occasion used this same\r\nanalytic tool as a guide in cases in which a defendant alleges for\r\nthe first time on appeal that the district court violated Criminal\r\nRule 11.  See, e.g., United \r                                      States v. Lopez-Pineda, 55 F.3d 693,\r\n696 (1st Cir. 1995). The multi-part test is not obligatory. Here,\r\nwhere both the trial court's error and the harmlessness of that\r\nerror are manifest, we need not perform the multi-part test.\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\n          By entering a guilty plea, a defendant effectively waives\r\n\na myriad of important constitutional rights. Thus, due process\r\n\ndemands that such a plea be made voluntarily, knowingly,\r\n\nintelligently, and with an awareness of the overall circumstances\r\n\nand probable consequences.  See Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238,\r\n\n243 n.5 (1969). To this end, Rule 11 has a predominantly\r\n\nprophylactic purpose. The main thrust of the rule is to ensure\r\n\nthat a defendant who pleads guilty does so with full comprehension\r\n\nof the specific attributes of the charge and the possible\r\n\nconsequences of the plea.  See United \r                                                States v. Lopez-Pineda, 55\r\n\nF.3d 693, 695 (1st Cir. 1995).\r\n\n          In neglecting to apprise the appellant of the mandatory\r\n\nminimum sentence applicable to the offense of conviction, the\r\n\ndistrict court tarnished an otherwise irreproachable plea colloquy\r\n\nand violated Rule 11.   See Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1) (stating,\r\n\namong other things, that \"before accepting a plea of guilty . . .\r\n\nthe court must address the defendant personally in open court and\r\n\ninform the defendant of, and determine that the defendant\r\n\nunderstands, . . . the mandatory minimum penalty provided by law\").\r\n\nIt follows that the appellant's claim of error is well founded.\r\n\n          This determination does not end our inquiry. Not every\r\n\nviolation of Rule 11 invalidates a guilty plea, and the Criminal\r\n\nRules specifically instruct courts to disregard any defect in a\r\n\nRule 11 proceeding that does not affect the defendant's substantial\r\n\nrights. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(h). In other words, even an error\r\n\nimplicating Rule 11's core concerns will not require vacating a\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nguilty plea if the error, in context, is harmless.\r\n\n          In the case at hand, the error did not impair the\r\n\nappellant's substantial rights. The court imposed a sentence of\r\n\n135 months   fifteen months longer than the mandatory minimum   and\r\n\ncalculated that sentence without any reference to the mandatory\r\n\nminimum. It is, therefore, readily apparent that because the\r\n\nguideline sentencing range (at its nadir) outstripped the mandatory\r\n\nminimum, the latter had no relevance to, and no actual effect upon,\r\n\nthe appellant's sentence. Consequently, the district court's\r\n\nfailure to apprise the appellant of the mandatory minimum was an\r\n\nerror that did no discernible harm.  See Lopez-Pineda, 55 F.3d at\r\n\n696; United States v. Johnson, 1 F.3d 296, 303 (5th Cir. 1993).\r\n\n          The appellant's fallback position is that, as a result of\r\n\nthe court's failure to inform him of the mandatory minimum\r\n\nsentence, he was deprived of the benefit of his bargain. This\r\n\nargument rests on the notion that, without the mandatory minimum,\r\n\nthe appellant had a chance to obtain a sentence less than 120\r\n\nmonths; and, while this prospect induced him to change his plea,\r\n\nthe undisclosed mandatory minimum rendered the prospect illusory.\r\n\n          The short answer is that this notion does not comport\r\n\nwith the facts: any chance that the appellant had to obtain a\r\n\nsentence of less than 120 months depended, at least in part, on\r\n\navoiding the two-level upward adjustment for possession of a\r\n\nfirearm. Since that enhancement was properly awarded, without any\r\n\n     Indeed, the existence of the mandatory minimum presented the\r\nappellant with an opportunity, through the operation of the so-\r\n\n                               10\r\r\n\nreference to the mandatory minimum, the court's omission could not\r\n\nhave affected the appellant's substantial rights.\r\n\n          We need go no further.\r                                          The purpose of insisting that the\r\n\njudge inform a defendant of the existence and potential\r\n\napplicability of a mandatory minimum sentence is to ensure that the\r\n\ndefendant is not induced to change his plea because of a totally\r\n\nunrealistic expectation as to how mild a sentence he might receive.\r\n\nThat purpose was not in any way frustrated by the omission that\r\n\noccurred here. Since the district court's bevue did not harm or\r\n\nprejudice the appellant in any cognizable way, the appeal founders.\r\n\nAffirmed.\r\n\ncalled \"safety valve\" provision, see 18 U.S.C. S 3553(f) (1994);\r\nUSSG S5C1.2, to obtain an appreciably lower sentence. In the final\r\nanalysis, however, the weapons enhancement blocked this avenue too.\r\nSee USSG S5C1.2(2).\r\n\n     We note in passing that the evidence strongly suggests that\r\nthe appellant, notwithstanding the district court's omission, knew\r\nof the mandatory minimum sentence all along. For instance, he\r\nconfirmed at the disposition hearing that he enjoyed ample\r\nopportunity to read the PSI Report and discuss it with his counsel\r\n  and that report states in two places that the offense carries a\r\nten-year mandatory minimum sentence. Furthermore, the possible\r\napplication of the \"safety valve\" provision was discussed in open\r\ncourt at the change-of-plea hearing   and that provision only comes\r\ninto play where a mandatory minimum sentence is in effect.\r\n\n                               11\r\n",

In this proceeding, defendant-\r\n\nappellant Cecilio F. McDonald asks in the alternative (1) that we\r\n\nvacate his guilty plea because the district court failed to advise\r\n\nhim of the applicable mandatory minimum sentence during the plea\r\n\ncolloquy, or (2) that we set aside his sentence due to an alleged\r\n\nerror in the calculation of his adjusted offense level. Taking\r\n\nsecond things first, we find no computational error. And while\r\n\nMcDonald's first point is well-taken   we agree that the district\r\n\ncourt erred in failing to apprise the appellant of the mandatory\r\n\nminimum sentence, \r                           see Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1)   we find that this\r\n\nerror was benign. Consequently, we affirm the appellant's\r\n\nconviction and sentence.\r\n\n                               I.\r\n\n                           Background\r\n\n          On September 18, 1995, the authorities searched the\r\n\nappellant's one-bedroom apartment in Providence, Rhode Island,\r\n\npursuant to a warrant. They found a cornucopia of drugs, money,\r\n\nand drug-related paraphernalia hidden in the parlor: 160.32 grams\r\n\nof crack cocaine, 2,656.47 grams of marijuana, $16,050 in cash,\r\n\nthree digital scales, and two dust masks. They also found a 9mm\r\n\nsemi-automatic pistol and a plastic bag containing several live\r\n\nrounds in a secret compartment in the bathroom vanity.\r\n\n          A federal grand jury subsequently returned an indictment\r\n\ncharging the appellant with possessing fifty grams or more of\r\n\ncocaine base (crack), intending to distribute it, in violation of\r\n\n21 U.S.C. S 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A) (1994). In due course, the\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nappellant pleaded guilty to the charge. During the plea colloquy,\r\n\nthe district court questioned him extensively in order to ascertain\r\n\nthat his guilty plea was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. Yet\r\n\nthe court neglected to mention that, due to the amount of crack\r\n\ninvolved, the offense carried a mandatory minimum ten-year\r\n\nsentence.\r\n\n          Following standard practice, the district court\r\n\ncommissioned the preparation of a Presentence Investigation Report\r\n\n(PSI Report). In it, the probation department reported that the\r\n\namount of crack involved called for a base offense level (BOL) of\r\n\n36; recommended a series of adjustments to the BOL; hypothesized\r\n\nthat the appellant belonged in criminal history category III; and\r\n\nforecast a guideline sentencing range of 210-262 months. In two\r\n\nplaces, the PSI Report unambiguously declared that a mandatory\r\n\nminimum sentence of ten years applied. The appellant (who told the\r\n\ncourt at sentencing that he had been afforded an ample opportunity\r\n\nto read and digest the PSI Report) filed a covey of objections, but\r\n\nhe neither took issue with the applicability of the mandatory\r\n\nminimum sentence nor complained that its existence had previously\r\n\nbeen withheld from him.\r\n\n          At the disposition hearing, the district judge determined\r\n\nthat the BOL was 34, not 36. He made two adjustments, subtracting\r\n\nthree levels for acceptance of responsibility,   see USSG S3E1.1\r\n\n(1995), and adding two levels for possession of a firearm, \r                                                                   see USSG\r\n\nS2D1.1(b)(1) (1995). The court then concluded that the appellant\r\n\nbelonged in criminal history category I. These determinations\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nyielded a sentencing range of 135-168 months.  See USSG Ch.5, Pt.\r\n\nA (Sentencing Table) (adjusted offense level 33, criminal history\r\n\ncategory I). The judge thereupon imposed a 135-month incarcerative\r\n\nsentence. This appeal ensued.\r\n\n                               II.\r\n\n                           Discussion\r\n\n          We begin with the weapons enhancement, cognizant that the\r\n\npropriety vel non of that ruling may affect the harmless error\r\n\nanalysis which the appellant's principal assignment of error\r\n\nentails.\r\n\n                               A.\r\n\n                     The Weapons Enhancement\r\n\n          We review factual determinations made in the course of\r\n\nsentencing for clear error, mindful that such determinations need\r\n\nonly be supported by preponderant evidence.

See\r\n\nLagasse, 87 F.3d at 22. But to establish the link the prosecution\r\n\nneed only prove that the defendant possessed the weapon during the\r\n\ncurrency of the offense, not necessarily that he actually used it\r\n\nin perpetrating the crime or that he intended to do so.

In\r\n\nshort, the weapon, though hidden, was readily available to protect\r\n\nthe appellant, the cash, and the drugs that he kept on the\r\n\npremises.\r\n\n          Where, as here, the government has shown that a firearm\r\n\npossessed by the defendant was present during the commission of the\r\n\noffense, the burden shifts to the defendant to persuade the\r\n\nfactfinder that a connection between the weapon and the crime is\r\n\nclearly improbable.  See Jackson, 3 F.3d at 509. On this record,\r\n\nwe cannot fault the lower court for holding that the appellant\r\n\nfailed to carry this burden. To be sure, the appellant denied all\r\n\nknowledge of the gun. But he neither adduced any evidentiary\r\n\nsupport for this denial nor suggested an innocent explanation for\r\n\nthe gun's presence.

However, a different rule sometimes obtains when a\r\n\ndefendant seeks for the first time to set aside his guilty plea in\r\n\nthe court of appeals.  See, e.g., United \r                                                   States v.

R. Crim. P.\r\n\n32(e). Here, the defendant's allegation implicates a core concern\r\n\nof Rule 11 and the record on appeal is adequately developed to\r\n\npermit direct review.  See United States v. Martinez-Martinez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"707600\"><a href=\"/opinion/707600/united-states-v-olivia-martinez-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span>\r\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1215</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1219 (1st Cir. 1995),  cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Hence, we consider the appellant's argument.\r\n\n     When a defendant moves in the district court to withdraw a\r\nguilty plea, we usually test that motion by means of a set multi-\r\npart analysis. See \r                             United States\r                                           v. \r                                              Gonzalez-Vazquez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195584\"><a href=\"/opinion/195584/united-states-v-gonzalez-vazquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n22-23 (1st Cir. 1994); United \r                                        States v.

We have on occasion used this same\r\nanalytic tool as a guide in cases in which a defendant alleges for\r\nthe first time on appeal that the district court violated Criminal\r\nRule 11.  See, e.g., United \r                                      States v. Lopez-Pineda, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196122\"><a href=\"/opinion/196122/united-states-v-lopez-pineda/\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">693</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n696 (1st Cir. 1995). The multi-part test is not obligatory. Here,\r\nwhere both the trial court's error and the harmlessness of that\r\nerror are manifest, we need not perform the multi-part test.\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\n          By entering a guilty plea, a defendant effectively waives\r\n\na myriad of important constitutional rights. Thus, due process\r\n\ndemands that such a plea be made voluntarily, knowingly,\r\n\nintelligently, and with an awareness of the overall circumstances\r\n\nand probable consequences.  See Boykin v. Alabama, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107951\"><a href=\"/opinion/107951/boykin-v-alabama/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n\n243 n.5 (1969). To this end, Rule 11 has a predominantly\r\n\nprophylactic purpose. The main thrust of the rule is to ensure\r\n\nthat a defendant who pleads guilty does so with full comprehension\r\n\nof the specific attributes of the charge and the possible\r\n\nconsequences of the plea.  See United \r                                                States v.

See Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1) (stating,\r\n\namong other things, that \"before accepting a plea of guilty . . .\r\n\nthe court must address the defendant personally in open court and\r\n\ninform the defendant of, and determine that the defendant\r\n\nunderstands, . . . the mandatory minimum penalty provided by law\").\r\n\nIt follows that the appellant's claim of error is well founded.\r\n\n          This determination does not end our inquiry. Not every\r\n\nviolation of Rule 11 invalidates a guilty plea, and the Criminal\r\n\nRules specifically instruct courts to disregard any defect in a\r\n\nRule 11 proceeding that does not affect the defendant's substantial\r\n\nrights. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(h). In other words, even an error\r\n\nimplicating Rule 11's core concerns will not require vacating a\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nguilty plea if the error, in context, is harmless.\r\n\n          In the case at hand, the error did not impair the\r\n\nappellant's substantial rights. The court imposed a sentence of\r\n\n135 months   fifteen months longer than the mandatory minimum   and\r\n\ncalculated that sentence without any reference to the mandatory\r\n\nminimum. It is, therefore, readily apparent that because the\r\n\nguideline sentencing range (at its nadir) outstripped the mandatory\r\n\nminimum, the latter had no relevance to, and no actual effect upon,\r\n\nthe appellant's sentence. Consequently, the district court's\r\n\nfailure to apprise the appellant of the mandatory minimum was an\r\n\nerror that did no discernible harm.  See Lopez-Pineda, 55 F.3d at\r\n\n696; United States v. Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5920\"><a href=\"/opinion/5920/united-states-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 303 (5th Cir. 1993).\r\n\n          The appellant's fallback position is that, as a result of\r\n\nthe court's failure to inform him of the mandatory minimum\r\n\nsentence, he was deprived of the benefit of his bargain. This\r\n\nargument rests on the notion that, without the mandatory minimum,\r\n\nthe appellant had a chance to obtain a sentence less than 120\r\n\nmonths; and, while this prospect induced him to change his plea,\r\n\nthe undisclosed mandatory minimum rendered the prospect illusory.\r\n\n          The short answer is that this notion does not comport\r\n\nwith the facts: any chance that the appellant had to obtain a\r\n\nsentence of less than 120 months depended, at least in part, on\r\n\navoiding the two-level upward adjustment for possession of a\r\n\nfirearm. Since that enhancement was properly awarded, without any\r\n\n     Indeed, the existence of the mandatory minimum presented the\r\nappellant with an opportunity, through the operation of the so-\r\n\n                               10\r\r\n\nreference to the mandatory minimum, the court's omission could not\r\n\nhave affected the appellant's substantial rights.\r\n\n          We need go no further.\r                                          The purpose of insisting that the\r\n\njudge inform a defendant of the existence and potential\r\n\napplicability of a mandatory minimum sentence is to ensure that the\r\n\ndefendant is not induced to change his plea because of a totally\r\n\nunrealistic expectation as to how mild a sentence he might receive.\r\n\nThat purpose was not in any way frustrated by the omission that\r\n\noccurred here. Since the district court's bevue did not harm or\r\n\nprejudice the appellant in any cognizable way, the appeal founders.\r\n\nAffirmed.\r\n\ncalled \"safety valve\" provision, see 18 U.S.C. S 3553(f) (1994);\r\nUSSG S5C1.2, to obtain an appreciably lower sentence. In the final\r\nanalysis, however, the weapons enhancement blocked this avenue too.\r\nSee USSG S5C1.2(2).\r\n\n     We note in passing that the evidence strongly suggests that\r\nthe appellant, notwithstanding the district court's omission, knew\r\nof the mandatory minimum sentence all along. For instance, he\r\nconfirmed at the disposition hearing that he enjoyed ample\r\nopportunity to read the PSI Report and discuss it with his counsel\r\n  and that report states in two places that the offense carries a\r\nten-year mandatory minimum sentence. Furthermore, the possible\r\napplication of the \"safety valve\" provision was discussed in open\r\ncourt at the change-of-plea hearing   and that provision only comes\r\ninto play where a mandatory minimum sentence is in effect.\r\n\n                               11\r\n</pre>",
