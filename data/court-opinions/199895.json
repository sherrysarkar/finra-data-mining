This case requires us to decide\n\nwhether a decision rendered by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB\n\nor Board) after a remand from a decision of this court is consistent\n\nwith that decision. Goodless Electric Company (Goodless) was first\n\naccused of unfair labor practices in 1994 when it refused to recognize\n\na union for collective bargaining purposes. An administrative law\n\njudge exonerated Goodless, but the Board reversed his decision. We\n\nreversed the Board, ruled that the Board's precedents required a\n\nfinding in favor of Goodless, and remanded the case to the Board for\n\nproceedings consistent with that decision.       Misinterpreting that\n\ndecision and its mandate, the NLRB once again decided on remand that\n\nGoodless had violated the law.      We again reverse.\n\n                                  I.\n\n           Before beginning the discussion, we must establish a\n\nshorthand notation for three of the four decisions that have previously\n\naddressed this case. An administrative law judge decided in favor of\n\nGoodless Electric Company, concluding that it had not engaged in unfair\n\nlabor practices.    The NLRB reversed this decision in Goodless I.\n\nGoodless Elec. Co., Inc., 321 NLRB 64 (1996) ( Goodless I).1 We reversed\n\n\n\n     1\n     The decision of the administrative law judge is reported as an\nappendix to Goodless I, 321 NLRB at 70-92.\n\n                                  -2-\n\fthe Board in Goodless II, and remanded the case for \"proceedings in\n\naccordance with this opinion.\" NLRB v. Goodless Elec. Co., 124 F.3d\n\n322, 331 (1st Cir. 1997) ( Goodless II). Upon remand, the NLRB again\n\ndecided against Goodless in Goodless III, the decision under review.\n\nGoodless Elec. Co., Inc. (Supplemental Decision and Order), 332 NLRB\n\nNo. 96, 2000 WL 1675503 at *1 (2000) (Goodless III).\n\nA. Legal Background\n\n            A union must usually demonstrate majority support among an\n\nemployer's employees in order to enter a collective bargaining\n\nagreement with an employer. However, in the construction industry, the\n\nshort-term nature of the employment and the contractor's need for\n\npredictable costs and a steady supply of skilled labor makes such\n\narrangements impractical. Thus, \"[c]ollective bargaining agreements in\n\nthe construction industry are commonly negotiated before the employees\n\nare hired because employers must be able to fix labor costs to make\n\nbids, and have a supply of skilled craftsmen ready for quick referral.\"\n\nTimothy Volk, Prehire Agreements in the Construction Industry, 9 J.L.\n\n& Com. 243, 245 (1989).      In response to this industry practice,\n\nCongress passed Section 8(f) of the National Labor Relations Act in\n\n1959.     29 U.S.C. § 158(f). This portion of the Act provided that\n\nconstruction industry employers may recognize unions prospectively.\n\nId.     Specifically, Section 8(f) provides:\n\n            It shall not be an unfair labor practice . . . for an\n            employer engaged primarily in the building and construction\n\n                                  -3-\n\f          industry to make an agreement covering employees engaged .\n          . . in the building and construction industry with a labor\n          organization of which building and construction employees\n          are members . . . because (1) the majority status of such\n          labor organization has not been established . . . or (2)\n          such agreement requires as a condition of employment,\n          membership in such labor organization . . . .\n\nId.\n\n          As we explained in Goodless II, \"[u]nder Section 8(f), a\n\nconstruction industry employer may enter into a relationship with a\n\nunion whereby the union bargains on behalf of the employer's employees\n\nprior to a showing that the union has garnered the support of a\n\nmajority of the employees.\" Goodless II, 124 F.3d at 323. A Section\n\n8(f) employer-union relationship is known as a \"prerecognition\n\nagreement;\" the employer does not formally recognize the union, but\n\nonly agrees to bargain with it for a limited period of time. The union\n\nmay obtain more permanent collective bargaining rights if it can\n\nconvert the Section 8(f) relationship into a Section 9(a) relationship.\n\nSection 9(a) provides for a traditional collective bargaining\n\nagreement, whereby\n\n          [r]epresentatives designated or selected for the purposes of\n          collective bargaining by the majority of the employees in a\n          unit appropriate for such purposes, shall be the exclusive\n          representatives of all the employees in such unit for the\n          purposes of collective bargaining in respect to rates of\n          pay, wages, hours of employment, or other conditions of\n          employment . . . .\n\n29 U.S.C. § 159(a). \"Under Section 9(a), once a union has become the\n\nrepresentative of a majority of the employees in an appropriate\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fbargaining unit, the employer is required to bargain with the union as\n\nthe employees' bargaining representative.\" Goodless II, 124 F.3d at\n\n324.\n\n          Unions are often eager to convert a Section 8(f) relationship\n\ninto a more permanent Section 9(a) relationship.         The precise\n\nrequirements for converting a Section 8(f) into a Section 9(a)\n\nrelationship have been delineated in many NLRB precedents:\n\n          The NLRB has held that Section 8(f) status may change to\n          Section 9(a) status by virtue of either a Board-certified\n          election or as the result of the employer's voluntary\n          recognition of the union as the majority collective\n          bargaining agent. Voluntary recognition requires the\n          union's unequivocal demand for, and the employer's\n          unequivocal grant of, voluntary recognition as the\n          employees' collective bargaining representative based on the\n          union's contemporaneous showing of majority employee\n          support.\n\nId. (citing James Julian, Inc., 310 NLRB 1247, 1252 (1993)). This case\n\nconcerns a dispute over whether Goodless voluntarily recognized Local\n\nNo. 7 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (the\n\nUnion).\n\nB. Factual Background\n\n          The background facts of the case are essentially undisputed.\n\nThey have been summarized in Goodless II, 124 F.3d at 323-27, and are\n\ndeveloped at length in the findings of fact appended to the NLRB\n\nadministrative law judge's original decision in the case. See Goodless\n\nI, 321 NLRB at 70-92.    We review only their basic outline here.\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f            Goodless and the Union established a Section 8(f)\n\nrelationship in 1988, from which either Goodless or the Union could\n\nwithdraw upon giving 150 days notice. By 1990, the economy in the\n\nregion began to falter and Goodless sought relief from certain\n\nprovisions of the agreement in order to keep its business competitive.\n\nIn June, 1992, Goodless indicated to the Union that \"any relationship\n\nbetween Goodless and the Union would expire as of June 30, 1993.\"\n\n            The next month, the Union threatened to cut off \"target\n\nmoney\" to Goodless if it failed to sign a \"letter of assent\" affirming\n\nits Section 8(f) relationship.2 The letter included the following\n\nlanguage:\n\n            The Employer agrees that if a majority of its employees\n            authorize the Local Union to represent them in collective\n            bargaining, the Employer will recognize the Local Union as\n            the NLRA [National Labor Relations Act] Section 9(a)\n            collective bargaining agent for all employees performing\n            electrical construction work within the jurisdiction of the\n            Local Union on all present and future jobsites.\n\nLeon Goodless signed the letter on behalf of Goodless on July 15, 1992.\n\n\n\n            Almost a year later, Goodless and the Union discussed the\n\npossibility of extending Goodless's Section 8(f) relationship with the\n\nunion beyond the original June 30, 1993 termination date.         When\n\nnegotiations stalled, the Union's business agent, Douglas Bodman, held\n\n\n     2 \"Target money was financial assistance provided by the\nUnion to aid union employers in competition with non-union\nelectrical contractors.\" Goodless II, 124 F.3d at 325 n.4.\n\n                                  -6-\n\fa meeting of all Goodless employees.     He encouraged them to \"sign\n\nauthorization cards as evidence of their desire for continued\n\nrepresentation,\" and all did so.       The cards stated:\n\n          I authorize Local Union No. 7 of the International\n          Brotherhood of Electrical Workers to represent me in\n          collective bargaining with my present and future employers\n          on all present and future jobsites within the jurisdiction\n          of the Union. This authorization is non-expiring, binding\n          and valid until such time as I submit a written revocation.\n\nGoodless II, 124 F.3d at 325. Bodman presented the cards at Goodless's\n\nnext meeting with Union representatives on June 25, 1993. Although\n\nLeon Goodless reacted angrily to the presentation of the cards, he\n\nlater consented to a six-month extension of bargaining with the Union,\n\nagreeing to continue the 8(f) relationship from July 1, 1993, to\n\nDecember 31, 1993.\n\n          At the end of 1993, Goodless again indicated its desire to\n\nterminate its relationship with the Union. The Union responded (via\n\nletter) on December 21, 1993, claiming that the letter of assent signed\n\non July 15, 1992, bound Goodless to recognize the Union as the\n\nexclusive bargaining agent if a majority of its employees authorized\n\nthe Union to represent them in collective bargaining.       The Union\n\nclaimed to have demonstrated majority support at the June 25, 1993,\n\nmeeting, and therefore alleged that Goodless could neither repudiate\n\nits collective bargaining relationship with the Union nor negotiate\n\ndirectly with its employees.\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f          Goodless ignored the letter and ceased recognizing the Union\n\nfor collective bargaining purposes as of January 1, 1994. Contending\n\nthat it had achieved Section 9(a) status, the Union complained to the\n\nNLRB that Goodless had engaged in unfair labor practices.3\n\n          As noted, the Administrative Law Judge who first heard the\n\ncase ruled in favor of Goodless. See Goodless I, 321 NLRB at 91-92.\n\nIn Goodless I, the Board reversed that decision and decided that the\n\nUnion became the Section 9(a) bargaining representative of Goodless's\n\nemployees when it presented the signed cards to Leon Goodless. In\n\nGoodless II, we reversed the Board and found that Goodless was not\n\nguilty of any unfair labor practices. We remanded the case to the\n\nBoard for proceedings consistent with Goodless II. In the decision\n\nunder review, Goodless III, the Board again found that Goodless had\n\ncommitted unfair labor practices.\n\n                                 II.\n\n          In deciding whether our decision in Goodless II permitted the\n\nBoard's decision in Goodless III, we first explain briefly the law of\n\n\n\n     3Specifically, the Union charged that Goodless violated two\nsections   of  the   National   Labor   Relations   Act.     See\n29 U.S.C. § 158(a)(5) (providing that \"It shall be an unfair\nlabor practice for an employer . . . to refuse to bargain\ncollectively with the representatives of his employees . . .\n.\");   29 U.S.C. § 158(a)(3) (providing that \"It shall be an\nunfair labor practice for an employer . . . by discrimination in\nregard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition\nof employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor\norganization . . . .\").\n\n                                 -8-\n\fthe case doctrine. We next summarize the law of this case as set forth\n\nin Goodless II. We then explain the Board's flawed understanding of\n\nthat law in Goodless III.\n\nA. The Law of the Case\n\n          The doctrine of the law of the case \"posits that when a court\n\ndecides upon a rule of law, that decision should continue to govern the\n\nsame issues in subsequent stages in the same case.\"        Arizona v.\n\nCalifornia, 460 U.S. 605, 618 (1983). This rule of practice promotes\n\nfinality and judicial efficiency by \"protecting against the agitation\n\nof settled issues.\" Christianson v. Colt Indus. Operating Corp., 486\n\nU.S. 800, 816 (1988) (quoting 1B J. Moore, J. Lucas & T. Currier,\n\nMoore's Federal Practice ¶ 0.404[1] at 118 (1984)). When an appellate\n\nopinion clearly addresses a disputed issue, it \" instructs an inferior\n\n[tribunal] to comply with [this decision] on remand.\" Field v. Mans,\n\n157 F.3d 35, 40 (1st Cir. 1998). An appellate court's mandate controls\n\nall issues that \"'were actually considered and decided by the appellate\n\ncourt, or as were necessarily inferred from the disposition on\n\nappeal.'\" Cohen v. Brown Univ., 101 F.3d 155, 188 (1st Cir. 1996)\n\n(quoting Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Walbrook Ins. Co., 41 F.3d 764,\n\n770 (1st Cir. 1994)).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f     Although the Board adheres to a policy of nonacquiescence4 in its\n\napplication of decisions of the courts of appeals, it recognizes as it\n\nmust that it cannot ignore the law of the case doctrine. Indeed, in\n\nGoodless III, the Board said that, \"[h]aving accepted the court's\n\nremand, we are bound by the law of the case established in the court's\n\nopinion.\"   Goodless III, 332 NLRB No. 96, 2000 WL 1675503, at *4.\n\n\n\n\nB. The Law of This Case\n\n     In reversing the Administrative Law Judge's finding that Goodless\n\nhad committed no unfair labor practices, the Board decided that the\n\nUnion became the Section 9(a) bargaining representative of Goodless's\n\nemployees when it presented the signed cards to Leon Goodless on June\n\n25, 1993. Finding that \"the letter of assent [signed by Leon Goodless\n\non July 15, 1992] constituted, for the remainder of its term, both a\n\n\n\n     4  Nonacquiescence refers to the \"selective refusal of\nadministrative agencies to conduct their internal proceedings\nconsistently with adverse rulings of the courts of appeals.\" Samuel\nEstreicher & Richard L. Revesz, Nonacquiescence by Federal\nAdministrative Agencies, 98 Yale L.J. 679, 681 (1989). The National\nLabor Relations Board, \"more than most [agencies], has openly asserted\nthe authority to decline to acquiesce.\" Id. at 706. The Board is\ncommitted to pressing its own view of the law until the Board itself or\nthe Supreme Court overrules it; it claims that piecemeal acceptance of\nparticular circuits' interpretations of the law would frustrate its\ndevelopment of a national labor policy. Id. at 706 (citing Insurance\nAgents' Int'l Union, 119 N.L.R.B. 768, 773 (1957)). However, the Board\ndoes \"acquiesce[] to [an appellate court's] treatment of a particular\ncase on remand.\" Id. at 706 n.148.\n\n                                 -10-\n\fcontinuing request by the Union for 9(a) recognition and a continuing,\n\nenforceable promise by [Goodless] to grant voluntary recognition on\n\nthat basis if the Union demonstrated majority support,\" Goodless I,\n\n321 NLRB at 66, the Board concluded that the Union had demonstrated\n\nmajority support contemporaneously with Goodless's recognition because\n\nthe letter signaled Goodless's continuing willingness to recognize the\n\nUnion whenever it had majority support among Goodless's workers. The\n\nBoard ordered Goodless to recognize the Union and to take several\n\nremedial measures.\n\n     On appeal, we determined \"that the NLRB misapplied its own\n\nprecedent.\" Goodless II, 124 F.3d at 327.   We found that \"Board case\n\nlaw . . . has set forth only two means by which a union may obtain\n\nSection 9(a) status during the course of a Section 8(f) relationship:\n\n(1) through a Board-certified election, or (2) through the employer's\n\nvoluntary grant of recognition\" in accordance with the standards\n\nenunciated in cases such as J & R Tile, Inc., 291 NLRB 1034, 1036\n\n(1988), and Golden West Electric, 307 NLRB 1494, 1495 (1992). Goodless\n\nII, 124 F.3d at 328-29. We explained that the Board's decision to\n\ntreat the July, 1992 letter of assent as an open offer to grant Section\n\n9(a) recognition was an unwarranted attempt to rely on technical\n\nprinciples of contract law to supplant the requirement \"that\n\nrecognition be based on a contemporaneous showing of majority support.\"\n\nId. at 330.\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\f     Thus, in Goodless II we held that \"Goodless did not violate\n\nSection 8(a)(5)\" in refusing to recognize the union. Id. at 331. We\n\nannounced that \"a finding in favor of Goodless is required.\" Id., at\n\n330. We ended the opinion with the following order: \"For the foregoing\n\nreasons, we reverse and remand to the National Labor Relations Board\n\nfor proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\"         Id. at 331.\n\nC. The Board's Decision on Remand (Goodless III)\n\n     On remand, the Board again found that Goodless had engaged in\n\nunfair labor practices. The Board asserted that \"a union's performance\n\nof the valid majoritarian conditions specified in a prospective 9(a)\n\nrecognition clause . . . is, in effect, a third option, in addition to\n\nthe 'two option[s]' that the court identified as the only available\n\noptions for achieving 9(a) status.\" Goodless III, 332 NLRB No. 96,\n\n2000 WL 1675503 at *7 (quoting Goodless II, 124 F.3d at 330). Although\n\nthe Board acknowledged that \"the Board's construction industry\n\nprecedent at the time of the events at issue made no express provision\n\nfor agreements like the one contained in the parties' 1992 letter of\n\nassent,\" Id. at *5, the Board supported its third option by discussing\n\nprecedents from \"outside the construction industry\" which upheld the\n\nvalidity of prospective recognition agreements.          Id. at *5-*6\n\n(discussing Snow & Sons, 134 NLRB 709 (1961); Kroger Co., 219 NLRB 388,\n\n389 (1975)).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\f     Despite the Board's reliance on these other precedents, the\n\nBoard's reasoning in Goodless I and Goodless III is structurally\n\nidentical: in both decisions, the Board focused on the legal\n\nsignificance of the letter of assent that Goodless signed on July 15,\n\n1992. Goodless I held that the letter constituted a standing offer to\n\nrecognize the union because of basic contract law principles; Goodless\n\nIII stated that the letter was equivalent to a \"prospective recognition\n\nagreement\" upheld by the Board in settings outside the construction\n\nindustry, id. at *6. Both decisions are at odds with Goodless II's\n\ncentral holding: \"Voluntary recognition requires the union's\n\nunequivocal demand for, and the employer's unequivocal grant of,\n\nvoluntary recognition as the employees' collective bargaining\n\nrepresentative based on the union's contemporaneous showing of majority\n\nemployee support.\" See Goodless II, 124 F.3d at 324 (citing James\n\nJulian, Inc. v. NLRB, 310 NLRB 1247, 1252 (1993)).\n\n     Having acknowledged that it must comply with the law of the case,\n\nthe Board had to explain why its \"freedom of action on remand,\"\n\nGoodless III, 332 NLRB No. 96, 2000 WL 1675503 at *4, permitted it to\n\nreach the same result for different reasons. That explanation began\n\nwith the Board's assertion that we misapprehended in Goodless II the\n\ntrue significance of the Board's precedents:\n\n     Board precedent, if read literally, as the court did, appeared to\n     require that a union's demand for 9(a) recognition, the employer's\n     agreement to recognize the union, and the union's showing of\n     majority status must all be simultaneous.\n\n                                 -13-\n\fId. at *4 (citing Goodless II, 124 F.3d at 328-29). To disabuse us of\n\nthis literal reading, the Board said that it could clarify on remand\n\nthe true scope of its precedents because \"the court stated [in Goodless\n\nII] that it could not accept the Board's departure from precedent 'in\n\nthe absence of some cogent explanation, an explanation that has not\n\nbeen forthcoming,'\" id. at *7 (quoting Goodless II, 124 F.3d at 330-\n\n31). The Board took this language as an invitation to reinstate its\n\nearlier ruling on remand, provided that it developed a \"cogent\n\nexplanation\" for its decision.\n\n     As further support for its freedom of action on remand, the Board\n\nnoted that Goodless II cited Shaw's Supermarkets, Inc. v. NLRB, 884\n\nF.2d 34 (1st Cir. 1989), \"a case in which the court, as here, also\n\nremanded and in which the Board clearly was not foreclosed from\n\nreaffirming its prior decision provided it adequately explained why it\n\nwas departing from precedent.\" Goodless III, 332 NLRB No. 96, 2000 WL\n\n1675503, at *8 (citing Shaw's Supermarkets, Inc., 303 NLRB 382 (1991)\n\n(on remand)).5 Finally, the Board parsed the language of our order at\n\nthe end of Goodless II, where we wrote: \"For the foregoing reasons, we\n\n\n     5 For purposes of this opinion, the Shaw's cases will be\nreferred to as follows:\n     Shaw's I: Original NLRB decision.\n     Shaw's II: Our decision vacating Shaw's I and remanding it\nback to the NLRB for reconsideration (Shaw's Supermarkets, Inc.\nv. NLRB, 884 F.2d 34, 35 (1st Cir. 1989)).\n     Shaw's III: Decision of the NLRB on remand (Shaw's\nSupermarkets. Inc., 303 NLRB 382 (1991) (Supplemental Decision\nand Order)).\n\n                                 -14-\n\freverse and remand to the National Labor Relations Board for\n\nproceedings in accordance with this opinion. Costs to respondent.\"\n\nGoodless II, 124 F.3d at 331 (emphasis in original). In the Board's\n\nview, \"[i]f the court's intent were merely to vacate the Board's prior\n\nOrder and to dismiss the complaint, there would have been no need to\n\nremand the case.\"    Goodless III, 332 NLRB at *7.\n\n     Other than a prohibition against saying that it was right in\n\nGoodless I for all of the reasons disapproved by us in Goodless II, the\n\nBoard concluded that there was no law of the case that constrained its\n\nfreedom of action on remand. It could simply reaffirm the result with\n\na different rationale that met the \"cogent explanation\" standard.\n\nAddressing the three reasons cited by the Board for its authority to\n\nreaffirm its finding of unfair labor practices by Goodless, we explain\n\nwhy the Board's reading of our decision in Goodless II is indefensible.\n\n\n\n1. The Shaw's Litigation\n\n     In Shaw's I, the Board found that Shaw's Supermarkets had\n\ncommitted unfair labor practices. We vacated that decision in Shaw's\n\nII, finding that the Board's precedents \"dictate a result in Shaw's\n\nfavor\" since Shaw's conduct \"lies tucked well within the boundary of\n\nthe lawful.\" Shaw's II, 884 F.2d at 36, 41. On remand, we permitted\n\nthe Board \"to modify or change its rule; to depart from, or to keep\n\nwithin, prior precedent, as long as it focuses upon the issue and\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fexplains why change is reasonable.\" Shaw's II, 884 F.2d at 41. The\n\nBoard saw no need to change its law:\n\n     We respectfully decline the court's invitation to change extant\n     Board law. For, with due respect to the court, we continue to\n     believe that, under that law, conduct like that involved herein\n     is unlawful. However, given the law of this case, we shall dismiss\n     the complaint.\n\nShaw's III, 303 NLRB at 382; see also, e.g., Camvac Int'l, Inc., 302\n\nNLRB 652, 653 (1991) (\"Having accepted the Sixth Circuit's remand as\n\nlaw of the case, we are bound by the Court's rationale as it applies to\n\nthis proceeding, and we cannot overlook the specifics of the court's\n\ndirective.\"); Memorial Hosp. of Roxborough, 231 NLRB 419 (1977)\n\n(stating that \"we recognize our acceptance of the court's decision on\n\nremand as binding on us for the purpose of deciding this case\"). In\n\nother words, the Board recognized in Shaw's III that the one option it\n\ndid not have on remand was declaring Shaw's conduct unlawful under\n\nextant law after we had decided otherwise. That recognition eluded the\n\nBoard in Goodless III.6\n\n2. The Remand\n\n\n\n\n     6The Board argues on appeal that Shaw's II also gave it the\noption of conceding, with an adequate explanation, that it was\ndeparting from precedent in finding Shaw's conduct an unfair\nlabor practice, and then reaffirming its prior decision.\nWhether that is an accurate reading of Shaw's II is irrelevant\nhere. In this case, the Board insists that it did not depart\nfrom precedent on remand.    Instead, it insists that it only\nclarified extant law.\n\n                                 -16-\n\f     In our order at the end of Goodless II, we did not simply remand\n\nto the Board.    We reversed and remanded.       Although we are not\n\nsuggesting that the word \"reversed\" has been used in court orders with\n\nunvarying meaning, we deem it significant here that the word \"reverse\"\n\nis defined to mean, inter alia, \"to alter to the opposite in character\n\nor tendency; change completely.\" Random House Webster's Unabridged\n\nDictionary 1647 (2d ed., 1997). The opposite result is a finding in\n\nfavor of Goodless, not another finding against it on different grounds.\n\nBy contrast, we did not use in our order the word \"vacate,\" which means\n\n\"to render inoperative; deprive of validity; void; annul.\" Id. at\n\n2100. An order to vacate only wipes the slate clean, leaving the next\n\noutcome uncertain, absent other direction. We left no uncertainty\n\nabout the proper outcome here.\n\n     Moreover, we reversed and remanded to the Board \"for proceedings\n\nin accordance with this opinion.\" Goodless II, 124 F.3d at 331. In\n\nthat opinion, we concluded that \"[u]nder the plain terms\" of Board\n\nprecedents, \"a finding in favor of Goodless is required.\" Id. at 330.\n\nWe added that \"Goodless did not violate Section 8(a)(5) by repudiating\n\nthat relationship or by unilaterally changing the terms and conditions\n\nof employment under the circumstances of this appeal.\" Id. Further\n\nproceedings before the Board that contravene these explicit holdings in\n\nfavor of Goodless are hardly \"in accordance with [our] opinion\" in\n\nGoodless II.\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\f     If that is so, the Board says, why bother to remand to us if we\n\ncould only dismiss the complaint against Goodless?    Goodless III, 332\n\nNLRB No. 96, 2000 WL 1675503, at *7. There are at least two answers,\n\nboth of which reflect respect for Board procedures. If there were\n\nancillary issues before the Board that needed to be addressed in\n\nconjunction with the dismissal of the complaint, the remand would have\n\ngiven the Board the opportunity to address them. Furthermore, our\n\ndecision in Goodless II gave the Board the opportunity on remand to\n\ndismiss the claim against Goodless while announcing that, henceforth,\n\nits new construction of the contemporaneity requirement would govern\n\nthis area of labor law. See NLRB v. Majestic Weaving Co., 355 F.2d\n\n854, 859 (2d Cir. 1966) (permitting the Board, \"after appropriate\n\nproceedings, [to] . . . fashion for prospective application a principle\n\nalong the general lines of that adopted here\"). However, the Board\n\ncould not reverse our holding in Goodless II by declaring that we had\n\nmisapprehended Board precedent and then reasserting its unfair labor\n\npractices finding against Goodless.\n\n3. \"Some Cogent Explanation\"\n\n     After concluding in Goodless II that \"a finding in favor of\n\nGoodless is required,\" we added that \"[w]e cannot accept the Board's\n\ndeparture from its own precedent in this case in the absence of some\n\ncogent explanation, an explanation that has not been forthcoming.\"\n\nGoodless II, 124 F.3d at 330-31.        Read literally in a spirit of\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\fnonacquiescence, and isolated from the rest of the text, this language\n\nmight embolden the Board to find an invitation for a cogent explanation\n\nthat would make the finding against Goodless acceptable to us.     Read\n\nfairly with fidelity to the principles of the law of the case\n\nrecognized by the Board in Shaw's III, this language precluded an\n\nunfair labor practices finding against Goodless on the basis of extant\n\nlaw.\n\n\n\nIII. Conclusion\n\n       In its effort to find \"freedom of action on remand,\" Goodless III,\n\n332 NLRB No. 96, 2000 WL 1675503, at *4, the Board focused on isolated\n\nlanguage from Goodless II to justify its renewed unfair labor practice\n\nfindings against Goodless. In fact, the Board has chosen to ignore our\n\nearlier ruling and disregard the law of the case. Goodless II stated\n\nunequivocally that \"a finding in favor of Goodless is required.\"\n\nGoodless II, 124 F.3d at 330.        We reversed Goodless I, further\n\nconfirming that conclusion.      We now reverse Goodless III, with an\n\nexplicit instruction that the Board dismiss the charges against\n\nGoodless.\n\n       So ordered.   Costs to respondent.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -19-\n\f",

Goodless Electric Company (Goodless) was first accused of unfair labor practices in 1994 when it refused to recognize a union for collective bargaining purposes. An administrative law judge exonerated Goodless, but the Board reversed his decision. We reversed the Board, ruled that the Board's precedents required a finding in favor of Goodless, and remanded the case to the Board for proceedings consistent with that decision.

An administrative law judge decided in favor of Goodless Electric Company, concluding that it had not engaged in unfair labor practices. The NLRB reversed this decision in <i>Goodless I. Goodless Elec.

Legal Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A union must usually demonstrate majority support among an employer's employees in order to enter a collective bargaining agreement with an employer. However, in the construction industry, the short-term nature of the employment and the contractor's need for predictable costs and a steady supply of skilled labor makes such arrangements impractical. Thus, \"[c]ollective bargaining agreements in the construction industry are commonly negotiated before the employees are hired because employers must be able to fix labor costs to make bids, and have a supply of skilled craftsmen ready for quick referral.\" Timothy Volk, <i>Prehire Agreements in the Construction Industry,</i> 9 J.L. &amp; Com. 243, 245 (1989). In response to this industry practice, Congress passed Section 8(f) of the National Labor Relations Act in 1959. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 158(f). This portion of the Act provided that construction industry employers may recognize unions prospectively. <i>Id.</i> Specifically, Section 8(f) provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It shall not be an unfair labor practice... for an employer engaged primarily in the building and construction industry to make an agreement covering employees engaged ... in the building and construction industry with a labor organization of which building and construction employees are members ... because (1) the majority status of such labor organization has not been established... or (2) such agreement requires as a condition of employment, membership in such labor organization....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Id.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we explained in <i>Goodless II,</i> \"[u]nder Section 8(f), a construction industry employer may enter into a relationship with a union whereby the union bargains on behalf of the employer's employees prior to a showing that the union has garnered the support of a majority of the employees.\" <i>Goodless II,</i> 124 F.3d at 323. A Section 8(f) employer-union relationship is known as a \"prerecognition agreement;\" the employer does not formally recognize the union, but only agrees to bargain with it for a limited period of time. The union may obtain more permanent collective bargaining rights if it can convert the Section 8(f) relationship into a Section 9(a) relationship. Section 9(a) provides for a traditional collective bargaining agreement, whereby</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[r]epresentatives designated or selected for the purposes of collective bargaining by the majority of the employees in a unit appropriate for such purposes, shall be the exclusive representatives of all the employees in such unit for the purposes of collective bargaining in respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment, or other conditions of employment....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 U.S.C. &#167; 159(a). \"Under Section 9(a), once a union has become the representative of a majority of the employees in an appropriate bargaining unit, the employer is required to bargain with the union as the employees' bargaining representative.\" <i>Goodless II,</i> 124 F.3d at 324.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unions are often eager to convert a Section 8(f) relationship into a more permanent Section 9(a) relationship.

Voluntary recognition requires the union's unequivocal demand for, and the employer's unequivocal grant of, voluntary recognition as the employees' collective bargaining representative based on the union's contemporaneous showing of majority employee support.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> (citing <i>James Julian, Inc.,</i> 310 NLRB 1247, 1252 (1993)).

Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The background facts of the case are essentially undisputed. They have been summarized in <i>Goodless II,</i> 124 F.3d at 323-27, and are developed at length in the findings of fact appended to the NLRB administrative law judge's original decision in the case. <i>See Goodless I,</i> 321 NLRB at 70-92. We review only their basic outline here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Goodless and the Union established a Section 8(f) relationship in 1988, from which either Goodless or the Union could withdraw upon giving 150 days notice. By 1990, the economy in the region began to falter and Goodless sought relief from certain provisions of the agreement in order to keep its business competitive. In June, 1992, Goodless indicated to the Union that \"any relationship between Goodless and the Union would expire as of June 30, 1993.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next month, the Union threatened to cut off \"target money\" to Goodless if it failed to sign a \"letter of assent\" affirming its Section 8(f) relationship.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The letter included the following language:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Employer agrees that if a majority of its employees authorize the Local Union to represent them in collective bargaining, the Employer will recognize the Local Union as the NLRA [National Labor Relations Act] Section 9(a) collective bargaining agent for all employees performing electrical construction work within the jurisdiction of the Local Union on all present and future jobsites.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leon Goodless signed the letter on behalf of Goodless on July 15, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Almost a year later, Goodless and the Union discussed the possibility of extending Goodless's Section 8(f) relationship with the union beyond the original June 30, 1993 termination date. When negotiations stalled, the Union's business agent, Douglas Bodman, held a meeting of all Goodless employees. He encouraged them to \"sign authorization cards as evidence of their desire for continued representation,\" and all did so. The cards stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I authorize Local Union No. 7 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers to represent me in collective bargaining with my present and future employers on all present and future jobsites within the jurisdiction of the Union. This authorization is non-expiring, binding and valid until such time as I submit a written revocation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Goodless II,</i> 124 F.3d at 325. Bodman presented the cards at Goodless's next meeting with Union representatives on June 25, 1993. Although Leon Goodless reacted angrily to the presentation of the cards, he later consented to a six-month extension of bargaining with the Union, agreeing to continue the 8(f) relationship from July 1, 1993, to December 31, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the end of 1993, Goodless again indicated its desire to terminate its relationship with the Union. The Union responded (via letter) on December 21, 1993, claiming that the letter of assent signed on July 15, 1992, bound Goodless to recognize the Union as the exclusive bargaining agent if a majority of its employees authorized the Union to represent them in collective bargaining. The Union claimed to have demonstrated majority support at the June 25, 1993, meeting, and therefore alleged that Goodless could neither repudiate its collective bargaining relationship with the Union nor negotiate directly with its employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Goodless ignored the letter and ceased recognizing the Union for collective bargaining purposes as of January 1, 1994. Contending that it had achieved Section 9(a) status, the Union complained to the NLRB that Goodless had engaged in unfair labor practices.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted, the Administrative Law Judge who first heard the case ruled in favor of Goodless. <i>See Goodless I,</i> 321 NLRB at 91-92. In <i>Goodless I,</i> the Board reversed that decision and decided that the Union became the Section 9(a) bargaining representative of Goodless's employees when it presented the signed cards to Leon Goodless. In <i>Goodless II,</i> we reversed the Board and found that Goodless was not guilty of any unfair labor practices.

Finding that \"the letter of assent [signed by Leon Goodless on July 15, 1992] constituted, for the remainder of its term, both a continuing request by the Union for 9(a) recognition and a continuing, enforceable promise by [Goodless] to grant voluntary recognition on that basis if the Union demonstrated majority support,\" <i>Goodless I,</i> 321 NLRB at 66, the Board concluded that the Union had demonstrated majority support contemporaneously with Goodless's recognition because the letter signaled Goodless's continuing willingness to recognize the Union whenever it had majority support among Goodless's workers. The Board ordered Goodless to recognize the Union and to take several remedial measures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, we determined \"that the NLRB misapplied its own precedent.\" <i>Goodless II,</i> 124 F.3d at 327. We found that \"Board case law ... has set forth only two means by which a union may obtain Section 9(a) status during the course of a Section 8(f) relationship: (1) through a Board-certified election, or (2) through the employer's voluntary grant of recognition\" in accordance with the standards enunciated in cases such as <i>J &amp; R Tile, Inc. v. Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen,</i> 291 NLRB 1034, 1036, 1988 WL 214248 (1988), and <i>Golden West Electric,</i> 307 NLRB 1494, 1495, 1992 WL 183678 (1992). <i>Goodless II,</i> 124 F.3d at 328-29. We explained that the Board's decision to treat the July, 1992 letter of assent as an open offer to grant Section 9(a) recognition was an unwarranted attempt to rely on technical principles of contract law to supplant the requirement \"that recognition be <i>based</i> on a <i>contemporaneous</i> showing of majority support.\" <i>Id.</i> at 330.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, in <i>Goodless II</i> we held that \"Goodless did not violate Section 8(a)(5)\" in refusing to recognize the union. <i>Id.</i> at 331. We announced that \"a finding in favor of Goodless is required.\" <i>Id.</i> at 330. We ended the opinion with the following order: \"For the foregoing reasons, we <i>reverse</i> and <i>remand</i> to the National Labor Relations Board for proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\" <i>Id.</i> at 331.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. The Board's Decision on Remand (<i>Goodless III</i>)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the Board again found that Goodless had engaged in unfair labor practices. The Board asserted that \"a union's performance of the valid majoritarian conditions specified in a prospective 9(a) recognition clause ... is, in effect, a third option, in addition to the `two option[s]' that the court identified as the only available options for achieving 9(a) status.\" <i>Goodless III,</i> 332 NLRB No. 96, 2000 WL 1675503 at *7 (quoting <i>Goodless II,</i> 124 F.3d at 330). Although the Board acknowledged that \"the Board's construction industry precedent at the time of the events at issue made no express provision for agreements like the one contained in the parties' 1992 letter of assent,\" <i>Id.</i> at *5, the Board supported its third option by discussing precedents from \"outside the construction industry\" which upheld the validity of prospective recognition agreements. <i>Id.</i> at *5-*6 (discussing <i>Snow &amp; Sons,</i> 134 NLRB 709 (1961); <i>Kroger Co. v. Retail Clerks Local No. 455,</i> 219 NLRB 388, 389, 1975 WL 5788 (1975)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the Board's reliance on these other precedents, the Board's reasoning in <i>Goodless I</i> and <i>Goodless III</i> is structurally identical: in both decisions, the Board focused on the legal significance of the letter of assent that Goodless signed on July 15, 1992. <i>Goodless I</i> held that the letter constituted a standing offer to recognize the union because of basic contract law principles; <i>Goodless III</i> stated that the letter was equivalent to a \"prospective recognition agreement\" upheld by the Board in settings outside the construction industry, <i>id.</i> at *6. Both decisions are at odds with <i>Goodless II</i>'s central holding: \"Voluntary recognition requires the union's unequivocal demand for, and the employer's unequivocal grant of, voluntary recognition as the employees' collective bargaining representative based on the union's contemporaneous showing of majority employee support.\" <i>See Goodless II,</i> 124 F.3d at 324 (citing <i>James Julian, Inc.,</i> 310 NLRB 1247, 1252, 1993 WL 148961 (1993)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having acknowledged that it must comply with the law of the case, the Board had to explain why its \"freedom of action on remand,\" <i>Goodless III,</i> 332 NLRB No. 96, 2000 WL 1675503 at *4, permitted it to reach the same result for different reasons. That explanation began with the Board's assertion that we misapprehended in <i>Goodless II</i> the true significance of the Board's precedents:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Board precedent, if read literally, as the court did, appeared to require that a union's demand for 9(a) recognition, the employer's agreement to recognize the union, and the union's showing of majority status must all be simultaneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at *4 (citing <i>Goodless II,</i> 124 F.3d at 328-29). To disabuse us of this literal reading, the Board said that it could clarify on remand the true scope of its precedents because \"the court stated [in <i>Goodless II</i>] that it could not accept the Board's departure from precedent `in the absence of some cogent explanation, an explanation that has not been forthcoming,'\" <i>id.</i> at *7 (quoting <i>Goodless II,</i> 124 F.3d at 330-31). The Board took this language as an invitation to reinstate its earlier ruling on remand, provided that it developed a \"cogent explanation\" for its decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As further support for its freedom of action on remand, the Board noted that <i>Goodless II</i> cited <i>Shaw's Supermarkets, Inc. v. NLRB,</i> 884 F.2d 34 (1st Cir.1989), \"a case in which the court, as here, also remanded and in which the Board clearly was not foreclosed from reaffirming its prior decision provided it adequately explained why it was departing from precedent.\" <i>Goodless III,</i> 332 NLRB No. 96, 2000 WL 1675503, at *8 (citing <i>Shaw's Supermarkets, Inc.,</i> 303 NLRB 382, 1991 WL 113270 (1991) (on remand)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Finally, the Board parsed the language of our order at the end of <i>Goodless II,</i> where we wrote: \"For the foregoing reasons, we <i>reverse</i> and <i>remand</i> to the National Labor Relations Board for proceedings in accordance with this opinion. Costs to respondent.\" <i>Goodless II,</i> 124 F.3d at 331 (emphasis in original). In the Board's view, \"[i]f the court's intent were merely to vacate the Board's prior Order and to dismiss the complaint, there would have been no need to remand the case.\" <i>Goodless III,</i> 332 NLRB at *7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other than a prohibition against saying that it was right in <i>Goodless I</i> for all of the reasons disapproved by us in <i>Goodless II,</i> the Board concluded that there was no law of the case that constrained its freedom of action on remand. It could simply reaffirm the result with a different rationale that met the \"cogent explanation\" standard. Addressing the three reasons cited by the Board for its authority to reaffirm its finding of unfair labor practices by Goodless, we explain why the Board's reading of our decision in <i>Goodless II</i> is indefensible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. The <i>Shaw's</i> Litigation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Shaw's I,</i> the Board found that Shaw's Supermarkets had committed unfair labor practices. We vacated that decision in <i>Shaw's II,</i> finding that the Board's precedents \"dictate a result in Shaw's favor\" since Shaw's conduct \"lies tucked well within the boundary of the lawful.\" <i>Shaw's II,</i> 884 F.2d at 36, 41. On remand, we permitted the Board \"to modify or change its rule; to depart from, or to keep within, prior precedent, as long as it focuses upon the issue and explains why change is reasonable.\" <i>Shaw's II,</i> 884 F.2d at 41. The Board saw no need to change its law:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We respectfully decline the court's invitation to change extant Board law. For, with due respect to the court, we continue to believe that, under that law, conduct like that involved herein is unlawful. However, given the law of this case, we shall dismiss the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Shaw's III,</i> 303 NLRB at 382; <i>see also, e.g., Camvac Int'l, Inc.,</i> 302 NLRB 652, 653 (1991) (\"Having accepted the Sixth Circuit's remand as law of the case, we are bound by the Court's rationale as it applies to this proceeding, and we cannot overlook the specifics of the court's directive.\"); <i>Memorial Hosp. of Roxborough,</i> 231 NLRB 419 (1977) (stating that \"we recognize our acceptance of the court's decision on remand as binding on us for the purpose of deciding this case\"). In other words, the Board recognized in <i>Shaw's III</i> that the one option it did not have on remand was declaring Shaw's conduct unlawful under extant law after we had decided otherwise. That recognition eluded the Board in <i>Goodless III.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The Remand</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our order at the end of <i>Goodless II,</i> we did not simply remand to the Board. We reversed and remanded. Although we are not suggesting that the word \"reversed\" has been used in court orders with unvarying meaning, we deem it significant here that the word \"reverse\" is defined to mean, <i>inter alia,</i> \"to alter to the opposite in character or tendency; change completely.\" <i>Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary</i> 1647 (2d ed. 1997). The opposite result is a finding in favor of Goodless, not another finding against it on different grounds. By contrast, we did not use in our order the word \"vacate,\" which means \"to render inoperative; deprive of validity; void; annul.\" <i>Id.</i> at 2100. An order to vacate only wipes the slate clean, leaving the next outcome uncertain, absent other direction. We left no uncertainty about the proper outcome here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, we reversed and remanded to the Board \"for proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\" <i>Goodless II,</i> 124 F.3d at 331. In that opinion, we concluded that \"[u]nder the plain terms\" of Board precedents, \"a finding in favor of Goodless is required.\" <i>Id.</i> at 330. We added that \"Goodless did not violate Section 8(a)(5) by repudiating that relationship or by unilaterally changing the terms and conditions of employment under the circumstances of this appeal.\" <i>Id.</i> Further proceedings before the Board that contravene these explicit holdings in favor of Goodless are hardly \"in accordance with [our] opinion\" in <i>Goodless II.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If that is so, the Board says, why bother to remand to us if we could only dismiss the complaint against Goodless? <i>Goodless III,</i> 332 NLRB No. 96, 2000 WL 1675503, at *7. There are at least two answers, both of which reflect respect for Board procedures. If there were ancillary issues before the Board that needed to be addressed in conjunction with the dismissal of the complaint, the remand would have given the Board the opportunity to address them. Furthermore, our decision in <i>Goodless II</i> gave the Board the opportunity on remand to dismiss the claim against Goodless while announcing that, henceforth, its new construction of the contemporaneity requirement would govern this area of labor law. <i>See NLRB v. Majestic Weaving Co.,</i> 355 F.2d 854, 859 (2d Cir. 1966) (permitting the Board, \"after appropriate proceedings, [to] ... fashion for prospective application a principle along the general lines of that adopted here\"). However, the Board could not reverse our holding in <i>Goodless II</i> by declaring that we had misapprehended Board precedent and then reasserting its unfair labor practices finding against Goodless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. \"Some Cogent Explanation\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After concluding in <i>Goodless II</i> that \"a finding in favor of Goodless is required,\" we added that \"[w]e cannot accept the Board's departure from its own precedent in this case in the absence of some cogent explanation, an explanation that has not been forthcoming.\" <i>Goodless II,</i> 124 F.3d at 330-31. Read literally in a spirit of nonacquiescence, and isolated from the rest of the text, this language might embolden the Board to find an invitation for a cogent explanation that would make the finding against Goodless acceptable to us. Read fairly with fidelity to the principles of the law of the case recognized by the Board in <i>Shaw's III,</i> this language precluded an unfair labor practices finding against Goodless on the basis of extant law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its effort to find \"freedom of action on remand,\" <i>Goodless III,</i> 332 NLRB No. 96, 2000 WL 1675503, at *4, the Board focused on isolated language from <i>Goodless II</i> to justify its renewed unfair labor practice findings against Goodless. In fact, the Board has chosen to ignore our earlier ruling and disregard the law of the case. <i>Goodless II</i> stated unequivocally that \"a finding in favor of Goodless is required.\" <i>Goodless II,</i> 124 F.3d at 330. We reversed <i>Goodless I,</i> further confirming that conclusion.

Legal Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A union must usually demonstrate majority support among an employer's employees in order to enter a collective bargaining agreement with an employer. However, in the construction industry, the short-term nature of the employment and the contractor's need for predictable costs and a steady supply of skilled labor makes such arrangements impractical. Thus, \"[c]ollective bargaining agreements in the construction industry are commonly negotiated before the employees are hired because employers must be able to fix labor costs to make bids, and have a supply of skilled craftsmen ready for quick referral.\" Timothy Volk, <i>Prehire Agreements in the Construction Industry,</i> 9 J.L. &amp; Com. 243, 245 (1989). In response to this industry practice, Congress passed Section 8(f) of the National Labor Relations Act in 1959. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 158(f).

They have been summarized in <i>Goodless II,</i> 124 F.3d at 323-27, and are developed at length in the findings of fact appended to the NLRB administrative law judge's original decision in the case. <i>See Goodless I,</i> 321 NLRB at 70-92. We review only their basic outline here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Goodless and the Union established a Section 8(f) relationship in 1988, from which either Goodless or the Union could withdraw upon giving 150 days notice. By 1990, the economy in the region began to falter and Goodless sought relief from certain provisions of the agreement in order to keep its business competitive. In June, 1992, Goodless indicated to the Union that \"any relationship between Goodless and the Union would expire as of June 30, 1993.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next month, the Union threatened to cut off \"target money\" to Goodless if it failed to sign a \"letter of assent\" affirming its Section 8(f) relationship.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The letter included the following language:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Employer agrees that if a majority of its employees authorize the Local Union to represent them in collective bargaining, the Employer will recognize the Local Union as the NLRA [National Labor Relations Act] Section 9(a) collective bargaining agent for all employees performing electrical construction work within the jurisdiction of the Local Union on all present and future jobsites.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leon Goodless signed the letter on behalf of Goodless on July 15, 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Almost a year later, Goodless and the Union discussed the possibility of extending Goodless's Section 8(f) relationship with the union beyond the original June 30, 1993 termination date. When negotiations stalled, the Union's business agent, Douglas Bodman, held a meeting of all Goodless employees. He encouraged them to \"sign authorization cards as evidence of their desire for continued representation,\" and all did so. The cards stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I authorize Local Union No. 7 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers to represent me in collective bargaining with my present and future employers on all present and future jobsites within the jurisdiction of the Union.

Bodman presented the cards at Goodless's next meeting with Union representatives on June 25, 1993. Although Leon Goodless reacted angrily to the presentation of the cards, he later consented to a six-month extension of bargaining with the Union, agreeing to continue the 8(f) relationship from July 1, 1993, to December 31, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the end of 1993, Goodless again indicated its desire to terminate its relationship with the Union. The Union responded (via letter) on December 21, 1993, claiming that the letter of assent signed on July 15, 1992, bound Goodless to recognize the Union as the exclusive bargaining agent if a majority of its employees authorized the Union to represent them in collective bargaining. The Union claimed to have demonstrated majority support at the June 25, 1993, meeting, and therefore alleged that Goodless could neither repudiate its collective bargaining relationship with the Union nor negotiate directly with its employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Goodless ignored the letter and ceased recognizing the Union for collective bargaining purposes as of January 1, 1994. Contending that it had achieved Section 9(a) status, the Union complained to the NLRB that Goodless had engaged in unfair labor practices.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted, the Administrative Law Judge who first heard the case ruled in favor of Goodless. <i>See Goodless I,</i> 321 NLRB at 91-92. In <i>Goodless I,</i> the Board reversed that decision and decided that the Union became the Section 9(a) bargaining representative of Goodless's employees when it presented the signed cards to Leon Goodless. In <i>Goodless II,</i> we reversed the Board and found that Goodless was not guilty of any unfair labor practices. We remanded the case to the Board for proceedings consistent with <i>Goodless II.</i> In the decision under review, <i>Goodless III,</i> the Board again found that Goodless had committed unfair labor practices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In deciding whether our decision in <i>Goodless II</i> permitted the Board's decision in <i>Goodless III,</i> we first explain briefly the law of the case doctrine.

Finding that \"the letter of assent [signed by Leon Goodless on July 15, 1992] constituted, for the remainder of its term, both a continuing request by the Union for 9(a) recognition and a continuing, enforceable promise by [Goodless] to grant voluntary recognition on that basis if the Union demonstrated majority support,\" <i>Goodless I,</i> 321 NLRB at 66, the Board concluded that the Union had demonstrated majority support contemporaneously with Goodless's recognition because the letter signaled Goodless's continuing willingness to recognize the Union whenever it had majority support among Goodless's workers.

The Board asserted that \"a union's performance of the valid majoritarian conditions specified in a prospective 9(a) recognition clause ... is, in effect, a third option, in addition to the `two option[s]' that the court identified as the only available options for achieving 9(a) status.\" <i>Goodless III,</i> 332 NLRB No. 96, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1675503</span></span> at *7 (quoting <i>Goodless II,</i> 124 F.3d at 330). Although the Board acknowledged that \"the Board's construction industry precedent at the time of the events at issue made no express provision for agreements like the one contained in the parties' 1992 letter of assent,\" <i>Id.</i> at *5, the Board supported its third option by discussing precedents from \"outside the construction industry\" which upheld the validity of prospective recognition agreements. <i>Id.</i> at *5-*6 (discussing <i>Snow &amp; Sons,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.L.R.B.</span> <span class=\"page\">709</span></span> (1961); <i>Kroger Co. v.

Both decisions are at odds with <i>Goodless II</i>'s central holding: \"Voluntary recognition requires the union's unequivocal demand for, and the employer's unequivocal grant of, voluntary recognition as the employees' collective bargaining representative based on the union's contemporaneous showing of majority employee support.\" <i>See Goodless II,</i> 124 F.3d at 324 (citing <i>James Julian, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">310</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.L.R.B.</span> <span class=\"page\">1247</span></span>, 1252, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">148961</span></span> (1993)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having acknowledged that it must comply with the law of the case, the Board had to explain why its \"freedom of action on remand,\" <i>Goodless III,</i> 332 NLRB No. 96, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1675503</span></span> at *4, permitted it to reach the same result for different reasons.

In other words, the Board recognized in <i>Shaw's III</i> that the one option it did not have on remand was declaring Shaw's conduct unlawful under extant law after we had decided otherwise. That recognition eluded the Board in <i>Goodless III.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The Remand</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our order at the end of <i>Goodless II,</i> we did not simply remand to the Board. We reversed and remanded. Although we are not suggesting that the word \"reversed\" has been used in court orders with unvarying meaning, we deem it significant here that the word \"reverse\" is defined to mean, <i>inter alia,</i> \"to alter to the opposite in character or tendency; change completely.\" <i>Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary</i> 1647 (2d ed. 1997). The opposite result is a finding in favor of Goodless, not another finding against it on different grounds. By contrast, we did not use in our order the word \"vacate,\" which means \"to render inoperative; deprive of validity; void; annul.\" <i>Id.</i> at 2100. An order to vacate only wipes the slate clean, leaving the next outcome uncertain, absent other direction. We left no uncertainty about the proper outcome here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, we reversed and remanded to the Board \"for proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\" <i>Goodless II,</i> 124 F.3d at 331. In that opinion, we concluded that \"[u]nder the plain terms\" of Board precedents, \"a finding in favor of Goodless is required.\" <i>Id.</i> at 330. We added that \"Goodless did not violate Section 8(a)(5) by repudiating that relationship or by unilaterally changing the terms and conditions of employment under the circumstances of this appeal.\" <i>Id.</i> Further proceedings before the Board that contravene these explicit holdings in favor of Goodless are hardly \"in accordance with [our] opinion\" in <i>Goodless II.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If that is so, the Board says, why bother to remand to us if we could only dismiss the complaint against Goodless? <i>Goodless III,</i> 332 NLRB No. 96, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1675503</span></span>, at *7. There are at least two answers, both of which reflect respect for Board procedures. If there were ancillary issues before the Board that needed to be addressed in conjunction with the dismissal of the complaint, the remand would have given the Board the opportunity to address them. Furthermore, our decision in <i>Goodless II</i> gave the Board the opportunity on remand to dismiss the claim against Goodless while announcing that, henceforth, its new construction of the contemporaneity requirement would govern this area of labor law. <i>See NLRB v. Majestic Weaving Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"270512\"><a href=\"/opinion/270512/national-labor-relations-board-v-majestic-weaving-co-inc-local-815/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">854</span></a></span>, 859 (2d Cir. 1966) (permitting the Board, \"after appropriate proceedings, [to] ... fashion for prospective application a principle along the general lines of that adopted here\"). However, the Board could not reverse our holding in <i>Goodless II</i> by declaring that we had misapprehended Board precedent and then reasserting its unfair labor practices finding against Goodless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. \"Some Cogent Explanation\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After concluding in <i>Goodless II</i> that \"a finding in favor of Goodless is required,\" we added that \"[w]e cannot accept the Board's departure from its own precedent in this case in the absence of some cogent explanation, an explanation that has not been forthcoming.\" <i>Goodless II,</i> 124 F.3d at 330-31. Read literally in a spirit of nonacquiescence, and isolated from the rest of the text, this language might embolden the Board to find an invitation for a cogent explanation that would make the finding against Goodless acceptable to us. Read fairly with fidelity to the principles of the law of the case recognized by the Board in <i>Shaw's III,</i> this language precluded an unfair labor practices finding against Goodless on the basis of extant law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its effort to find \"freedom of action on remand,\" <i>Goodless III,</i> 332 NLRB No. 96, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1675503</span></span>, at *4, the Board focused on isolated language from <i>Goodless II</i> to justify its renewed unfair labor practice findings against Goodless. In fact, the Board has chosen to ignore our earlier ruling and disregard the law of the case. <i>Goodless II</i> stated unequivocally that \"a finding in favor of Goodless is required.\" <i>Goodless II,</i> 124 F.3d at 330. We reversed <i>Goodless I,</i> further confirming that conclusion. We now reverse <i>Goodless III,</i> with an explicit instruction that the Board dismiss the charges against Goodless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.
