The  doctrine  of\r\n\ncollateral  estoppel  or   issue  preclusion  made  the   earlier\r\n\nMassachusetts  state   court  determination   against  appellants\r\n\nbinding  in the present  federal court action.   See 28  U.S.C.  \r                                                              \r\n\n1738.  Massachusetts  may follow the Restatement of  Judgments,  \r                                                                        \r\n\n28(5)(c) (1982),  in recognizing  a limited  exception where  the\r\n\nparty opposing collateral  estoppel makes a clear  and convincing\r\n\nshowing that it was deprived of  the opportunity to obtain a full\r\n\nand fair  adjudication in the  earlier case, but no  such showing\r\n\nwas made by the appellants in this  case.  Accordingly, we do not\r\n\nreach appellants'  other  claims of  error which,  as both  sides\r\n\nagree, are of no importance  once collateral estoppel is found to\r\n\napply.\r\n\n            Affirmed.\r                      Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n",
