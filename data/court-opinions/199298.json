Ernest C. Torres, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                     Selya, Lynch and Lipez,\n\n                        Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Brian M. Glover, by appointment of the court, for appellant.\n     Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMargaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, and Kenneth P. Madden,\nAssistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                         March 2, 2001\n\f          SELYA, Circuit Judge. On May 26, 1999, a federal grand jury\n\nsitting in the District of Rhode Island returned a six-count\n\nsuperseding indictment against defendant-appellant Oscar Caba and a\n\ncodefendant, Manolo Vargas.     Counts 1 and 2 charged the men with\n\nconspiring together and with others to distribute, and to possess with\n\nintent to distribute, heroin and cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. §\n\n846.   Count 3 charged the men with having distributed, on a date\n\ncertain, 9.6 grams of heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) &\n\n(b)(1)(C). The last three counts pertained to activities allegedly\n\noccurring on a single day (March 26, 1999): possessing 25.8 grams of\n\nheroin with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1)\n\n& (b)(1)(C) (count 4); possessing 934 grams of cocaine (in powder form)\n\nwith intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) &\n\n(b)(1)(B) (count 5); and possessing 143.7 grams of cocaine base (crack\n\ncocaine) with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. §\n\n841(a)(1) & (b)(1)(A) (count 6).       The government timely filed an\n\ninformation memorializing the appellant's prior felony drug conviction,\n\nthereby putting him on notice of its intention to seek a sentencing\n\nenhancement.   See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C) (increasing statutory\n\nmaximum from twenty to thirty years for a violation involving an\n\nunspecified amount of a Schedule I or II controlled substance if the\n\noffender has a prior felony drug conviction).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f          Vargas entered a guilty plea and the appellant stood trial\n\nalone. Following a six-day joust, a jury convicted him on the first\n\nfive counts but acquitted him on count 6 (the crack cocaine count). At\n\nsentencing, the district court made several findings relevant to the\n\nappellant's guideline sentencing range. In the end, the court set the\n\nrange at 235-293 months (offense level 36; criminal history category\n\nIII) and imposed an incarcerative sentence at the very top of the\n\nrange, to be followed by an eight-year supervised release term. This\n\nappeal ensued.\n\n          In this venue, the appellant presses a series of sentence-\n\nrelated claims.    As we explain below, none has merit.\n\n          We start, as does the appellant, with the district court's\n\ninclusion of the 143.7 grams of crack cocaine in computing his\n\nguideline sentencing range. See generally USSG §2D1.1, comment. (n.12)\n\n(\"Types and quantities of drugs not specified in the count of\n\nconviction may be considered in determining the offense level.\"). The\n\nappellant vigorously attacks this finding. His principal claim draws\n\nits essence from the Supreme Court's decision in Apprendi v. New\n\nJersey, 120 S. Ct. 2348 (2000).    There, the Court held that, in a\n\ncriminal case, \"[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact\n\nthat increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory\n\nmaximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.\" Id. at 2362-63. The appellant seeks to extend this rule by\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\farguing that it was error for the court to increase his sentence based\n\non its finding that the government had shown by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that the appellant possessed the crack cocaine as part of the\n\nconspiracy.\n\n          This argument runs along the following lines.          Under\n\nApprendi's rationale, the appellant says, the issue of drug quantity\n\nwas one for the jury — not the court — to resolve, and, in all events,\n\nthe decision should have been guided by the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt\n\nstandard (rather than by the less demanding \"preponderance\" standard).\n\n          This argument has an unusual twist. The appellant concedes,\n\nas he must, that the court's inclusion of the 143.7 grams of crack\n\ncocaine in the guideline calculations had no effect on the applicable\n\nstatutory maximum.1 Rather, the appellant argues that the drug quantity\n\nfinding influenced his guideline sentencing range (and, hence, his\n\nsentence) in a meaningful way and asserts that the Apprendi principle\n\nshould be extended to require submission to the jury of any factor that\n\nsignificantly impacts a defendant's sentence.       It is enough, the\n\nappellant suggests, that a finding has a \"dramatic effect\" on the\n\nsentence that a defendant receives.\n\n\n\n     1\n     The appellant received a 293-month sentence. The lowest\nstatutory maximum that applies to narcotics distribution cases\nlike this one, in which the government filed a sentencing\nenhancement information based on a prior felony drug conviction,\nis thirty years.    21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C).      The sentence\nimposed, therefore, was well within the statutory maximum.\n\n                                 -4-\n\f           We reject this expansive reading of Apprendi. By its own\n\nterms, the holding in Apprendi applies only when the disputed \"fact\"\n\nenlarges the applicable statutory maximum and the defendant's sentence\n\nexceeds the original maximum. Id. For this reason, Apprendi simply\n\ndoes not apply to guideline findings (including, inter alia, drug\n\nweight calculations) that increase the defendant's sentence, but do not\n\nelevate the sentence to a point beyond the lowest applicable statutory\n\nmaximum. United States v. Lafreniere, 236 F.3d 41, 50 (1st Cir. 2001);\n\nUnited States v. Baltas, 236 F.3d 27, 41 (1st Cir. 2001); United States\n\nv. Keith, 230 F.3d 784, 787 (5th Cir. 2000) (per curiam), cert. denied,\n\n___ S. Ct. ___ (2001) [2001 WL 70558]; United States v. Hernandez-\n\nGuardado, 228 F.3d 1017, 1027 (9th Cir. 2000); United States v. Aguayo-\n\nDelgado, 220 F.3d 926, 933 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 121 S. Ct. 600\n\n(2000). In other words, even after Apprendi, the existence vel non of\n\nsentencing factors that boost a defendant's sentence but do not trip a\n\nnew statutory maximum remain grist for the district judge's mill under\n\na preponderance-of-the-evidence standard.\n\n           In much the same vein, the appellant asserts that, in light\n\nof Apprendi, the issue of his role in the offense — specifically, the\n\nissue of whether he was an organizer or leader under USSG §3B1.1(c) —\n\nshould have been resolved by the jury under the beyond-a-reasonable-\n\ndoubt   standard   instead   of   by   the   district   court   under   the\n\npreponderance-of-the-evidence standard. Once again, the challenged\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\ffinding raised the appellant's offense level (and, hence, his ultimate\n\nsentence) but did not elevate the applicable statutory maximum.\n\nConsequently, for the reasons previously discussed, this claim too must\n\nbe rejected.\n\n          The appellant's next asseveration rests squarely upon the\n\nfact that the jury acquitted him on count 6 (the crack cocaine count).\n\nContrary to his importunings, however, this fact does not change the\n\ndecisional calculus concerning the sentencing court's inclusion of the\n\ncrack cocaine as relevant conduct under USSG §1B1.3(a)(2). The Supreme\n\nCourt has held that a district court, without offending due process,\n\nmay consider at sentencing, and act upon, acquitted conduct. United\n\nStates v. Watts, 519 U.S. 148, 157 (1997) (per curiam). Moreover, the\n\ngovernment need prove such conduct only by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence. United States v. Amirault, 224 F.3d 9, 15 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(collecting cases). Because the Supreme Court's holding in Apprendi\n\ndoes not call into question the validity of this line of cases, the\n\nappellant's reliance on the acquittal is misplaced.\n\n          Finally, the appellant maintains that the drug quantity and\n\nrole-in-the-offense findings, even if within the court's purview, are\n\nunsupported in the record.     We do not agree.\n\n          As to drug quantity, the appellant's argument again centers\n\non the inclusion of the crack cocaine in the court's computations.\n\nThat finding hinges on the court's binary determination that the\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fappellant dealt in crack cocaine and that those dealings were \"relevant\n\nconduct,\" USSG §1B1.3, that is, part and parcel of the overall drug-\n\ntrafficking activities comprehended by the counts of conviction. It is\n\nsettled beyond peradventure that a sentencing court's findings of fact\n\nin respect to relevant conduct will not be set aside unless they are\n\nclearly erroneous. United States v. Tejada-Beltran, 50 F.3d 105, 109\n\n(1st Cir. 1995).\n\n          Here, the district court thought it \"very clear\" that the\n\nappellant was inextricably linked to the 143.7 grams of crack cocaine\n\nfound in Vargas's bedroom (and, accordingly, that the crack cocaine was\n\ntied to the appellant's drug-trafficking activities). While the proof\n\non that point was conflicting — Vargas, for example, made inconsistent\n\nstatements — there was ample evidence in the record to support the\n\nfinding. The crack cocaine was discovered at a \"stash house\" for the\n\nappellant's operation (along with large quantities of heroin and\n\npowdered cocaine that the appellant was convicted of possessing). The\n\nappellant was seen at that location on numerous occasions, he had\n\nextensive telephone contact with persons there, and his fingerprints\n\nadorned a number of incriminating items seized from the locus. Indeed,\n\nlike peas in a pod, the bag containing the 143.7 grams of crack cocaine\n\nand several bags containing powdered cocaine were in a single package,\n\nhidden in a television console — and the appellant’s fingerprint was\n\nfound on one of the bags of powdered cocaine.      Given the district\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fcourt's detailed findings and the facts of record, we cannot say that\n\nthe court clearly erred in deciding that the crack cocaine was properly\n\nattributable to the appellant for sentencing purposes. See United\n\nStates v. Ruiz, 905 F.2d 499, 508 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"[W]here there is\n\nmore than one plausible view of the circumstances, the sentencing\n\ncourt's choice among supportable alternatives cannot be clearly\n\nerroneous.\").\n\n          The appellant's remaining claim is that the district court\n\nerred in concluding that he was an organizer or leader under USSG\n\n§3B1.1(c). We review such findings for clear error. United States v.\n\nGraciani, 61 F.3d 70, 74 (1st Cir. 1995).       We discern none here.\n\n          The two-level upward adjustment for a defendant's role in the\n\noffense applies \"[i]f the defendant was an organizer, leader, manager,\n\nor supervisor in any criminal activity.\" USSG §3B1.1(c). A defendant\n\noccupies this status if he \"'exercised control over, or was otherwise\n\nresponsible for organizing the activities of, at least one other\n\nindividual in committing the crime.'\" United States v. Medina, 167\n\nF.3d 77, 80 (1st Cir. 1999) (quoting United States v. DiSanto, 86 F.3d\n\n1238, 1259 (1st Cir. 1996)). A defendant's role in the offense \"can be\n\nproved wholly by circumstantial evidence.\" United States v. Cruz, 120\n\nF.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1997) (en banc).\n\n          In this case, the district court concluded that the appellant\n\nwas an organizer or leader after finding that Vargas was his subaltern.\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fThis finding was based, inter alia, on evidence that Vargas told an\n\nundercover agent that he worked for the appellant and referred to the\n\nappellant as \"the big.\" These statements,2 coupled with evidence\n\nsuggesting that the appellant gave Vargas directions in regard to the\n\nconsummated heroin transaction (described in count 3 of the indictment)\n\nand that the appellant devised the plan for the parties' anticipated\n\nfuture drug transactions, sufficed to ground the role-in-the-offense\n\nenhancement. Cf. United States v. Akitoye, 923 F.2d 221, 227 (1st Cir.\n\n1991) (affirming two-level enhancement for supervisory role where\n\nevidence supported an inference that the defendant controlled the drugs\n\nand gave orders to a subordinate).\n\n            We need go no further. The appellant struggles mightily, but\n\nhe is unable to cast a shadow of a doubt on the lawfulness of his\n\nsentence.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n     To be sure, Vargas tried to explain these statements away\nat trial, saying that he worked for the appellant in a\nlegitimate business.    The district court, however, was at\nliberty to take Vargas's words as descriptive of the drug-\ntrafficking hierarchy. See Ruiz, 905 F.2d at 508.\n\n                                  -9-\n\f",

The crack cocaine was discovered at a \"stash house\" for the appellant's operation (along with large quantities of heroin and powdered cocaine that the appellant was convicted of possessing).

Ernest C. Torres, U.S. District Judge][Copyrighted Material Omitted]</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brian M. Glover, by appointment of the court, for appellant.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, and Kenneth P. Madden, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before Selya, Lynch and Lipez, Circuit Judges.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SELYA, Circuit Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 26, 1999, a federal grand jury sitting in the District of Rhode Island returned a six-count superseding indictment against defendant-appellant Oscar Caba and a codefendant, Manolo Vargas. Counts 1 and 2 charged the men with conspiring together and with others to distribute, and to possess with intent to distribute, heroin and cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846. Count 3 charged the men with having distributed, on a date certain, 9.6 grams of heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) &amp; (b)(1)(C). The last three counts pertained to activities allegedly occurring on a single day (March 26, 1999): possessing 25.8 grams of heroin with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) &amp; (b)(1)(C) (count 4); possessing 934 grams of cocaine (in powder form) with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) &amp; (b)(1)(B) (count 5); and possessing 143.7 grams of cocaine base (crack cocaine) with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) &amp; (b)(1)(A) (count 6). The government timely filed an information memorializing the appellant's prior felony drug conviction, thereby putting him on notice of its intention to seek a sentencing enhancement. See 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C) (increasing statutory maximum from twenty to thirty years for a violation involving an unspecified amount of a Schedule I or II controlled substance if the offender has a prior felony drug conviction).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vargas entered a guilty plea and the appellant stood trial alone. Following a six-day joust, a jury convicted him on the first five counts but acquitted him on count 6 (the crack cocaine count). At sentencing, the district court made several findings relevant to the appellant's guideline sentencing range. In the end, the court set the range at 235-293 months (offense level 36; criminal history category III) and imposed an incarcerative sentence at the very top of the range, to be followed by an eight-year supervised release term. This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this venue, the appellant presses a series of sentence-related claims. As we explain below, none has merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start, as does the appellant, with the district court's inclusion of the 143.7 grams of crack cocaine in computing his guideline sentencing range. See generally USSG &#167;2D1.1, comment. (n.12) (\"Types and quantities of drugs not specified in the count of conviction may be considered in determining the offense level.\"). The appellant vigorously attacks this finding. His principal claim draws its essence from the Supreme Court's decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2348</span></a></span> (2000). There, the Court held that, in a criminal case, \"[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Id. at 2362-63. The appellant seeks to extend this rule by arguing that it was error for the court to increase his sentence based on its finding that the government had shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the appellant possessed the crack cocaine as part of the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument runs along the following lines. Under Apprendi's rationale, the appellant says, the issue of drug quantity was one for the jury -- not the court -- to resolve, and, in all events, the decision should have been guided by the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard (rather than by the less demanding \"preponderance\" standard).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument has an unusual twist. The appellant concedes, as he must, that the court's inclusion of the 143.7 grams of crack cocaine in the guideline calculations had no effect on the applicable statutory maximum.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Rather, the appellant argues that the drug quantity finding influenced his guideline sentencing range (and, hence, his sentence) in a meaningful way and asserts that the Apprendi principle should be extended to require submission to the jury of any factor that significantly impacts a defendant's sentence. It is enough, the appellant suggests, that a finding has a \"dramatic effect\" on the sentence that a defendant receives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject this expansive reading of Apprendi. By its own terms, the holding in Apprendi applies only when the disputed \"fact\" enlarges the applicable statutory maximum and the defendant's sentence exceeds the original maximum. Id. For this reason, Apprendi simply does not apply to guideline findings (including, inter alia, drug weight calculations) that increase the defendant's sentence, but do not elevate the sentence to a point beyond the lowest applicable statutory maximum. United States v. Lafreniere, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199220\"><a href=\"/opinion/199220/united-states-v-lafreniere/\"><span class=\"volume\">236</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 50 (1st Cir. 2001);United States v.

Aguayo-Delgado, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769692\"><a href=\"/opinion/769692/united-states-v-fabian-aguayo-delgado/\"><span class=\"volume\">220</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">926</span></a></span>, 933 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">600</span></span> (2000). In other words, even after Apprendi, the existence vel non of sentencing factors that boost a defendant's sentence but do not trip a new statutory maximum remain grist for the district judge's mill under a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In much the same vein, the appellant asserts that, in light of Apprendi, the issue of his role in the offense -- specifically, the issue of whether he was an organizer or leader under USSG &#167;3B1.1(c) -- should have been resolved by the jury under the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard instead of by the district court under the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard. Once again, the challenged finding raised the appellant's offense level (and, hence, his ultimate sentence) but did not elevate the applicable statutory maximum. Consequently, for the reasons previously discussed, this claim too must be rejected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's next asseveration rests squarely upon the fact that the jury acquitted him on count 6 (the crack cocaine count). Contrary to his importunings, however, this fact does not change the decisional calculus concerning the sentencing court's inclusion of the crack cocaine as relevant conduct under USSG &#167;1B1.3(a)(2). The Supreme Court has held that a district court, without offending due process, may consider at sentencing, and act upon, acquitted conduct. United States v. Watts, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118073\"><a href=\"/opinion/118073/united-states-v-watts/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span>, 157 (1997) (per curiam). Moreover, the government need prove such conduct only by a preponderance of the evidence. United States v. Amirault, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799753\"><a href=\"/opinion/799753/united-states-v-alan-lee-amirault/\"><span class=\"volume\">224</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 15 (1st Cir. 2000) (collecting cases). Because the Supreme Court's holding in Apprendi does not call into question the validity of this line of cases, the appellant's reliance on the acquittal is misplaced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the appellant maintains that the drug quantity and role-in-the-offense findings, even if within the court's purview, are unsupported in the record. We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to drug quantity, the appellant's argument again centers on the inclusion of the crack cocaine in the court's computations. That finding hinges on the court's binary determination that the appellant dealt in crack cocaine and that those dealings were \"relevant conduct,\" USSG &#167;1B1.3, that is, part and parcel of the overall drug-trafficking activities comprehended by the counts of conviction. It is settled beyond peradventure that a sentencing court's findings of fact in respect to relevant conduct will not be set aside unless they are clearly erroneous. United States v. Tejada-Beltran, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"691951\"><a href=\"/opinion/691951/united-states-v-maximo-e-tejada-beltran-alias-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span>, 109 (1st Cir. 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court thought it \"very clear\" that the appellant was inextricably linked to the 143.7 grams of crack cocaine found in Vargas's bedroom (and, accordingly, that the crack cocaine was tied to the appellant's drug-trafficking activities).
