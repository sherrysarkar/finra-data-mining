The district court\r\n\nmade supportable findings that:  (i) the bank robbery  investiga-\r\n\ntion  had  focused on  the  passengers  in this  particular  taxi\r\n\nbecause bank surveillance photographs, and an eyewitness  report,\r\n\nrevealed  that Sutherland  had  committed two  bank robberies  in\r\n\nPortland,  the  most recent  having been  at  9:00 a.m.  the same\r\n\nmorning;  (ii) an  ABC taxi  had been dispatched  to Sutherland's\r\n\nPortland residence  around 11:00 a.m. to  transport Sutherland   \r\n\nand a female companion  suspected of assisting him in  an earlier\r\n\nPortland bank  robbery    to  Lynn, Massachusetts; and  (iii) the\r\n\nPortland  police  had  notified  the  Massachusetts  State Police\r\n\n(\"MSP\")  to  stop the  taxi,  and  provided a  specific  physical\r\n\ndescription of Sutherland, including  items of his clothing (grey\r\n\nor white sweatshirt  and black leather jacket), together with the\r\n\ninformation that he  had obtained  $2,460 in $20  bills from  the\r\n\nbank robbery earlier that day. \r\n\n          Upon stopping the taxi, which contained two passengers,\r\n\na male  and a female, the MSP observed a black leather jacket and\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\na grey sweatshirt inside the vehicle.  The male passenger matched\r\n\nthe physical description provided by the Portland police.1  \r\n\n          We  review  the district  court's factual  findings for\r\n\nclear  error, see United States  v. Martinez-Molina, 64 F.3d 719,\r                                                             \r\n\n726 (1st Cir. 1995), whereas its ultimate  legal determination as\r\n\nto whether a  given set  of facts established  probable cause  is\r\n\nsubject to plenary review,  see United States v. Zapata,  18 F.3d\r                                                                 \r\n\n971, 975 (1st Cir. 1994).  There is probable cause for a warrant-\r\n\nless arrest  if \"the  facts and  circumstances within  [the offi-\r\n\ncer[s']] knowledge and of which [they] had reasonably trustworthy\r\n\ninformation  were sufficient  to  warrant a  prudent [person]  in\r\n\nbelieving that the [defendant]  had committed . . .  an offense.\"\r\n\nAlexis v. McDonald's Restaurants of Mass., Inc., 67 F.3d 341, 349\r                                                         \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1995) (some brackets in original).  These findings were\r\n\nsufficient  to  support  the district  court's  \"probable  cause\"\r\n\nruling.2 \r\n\n          Sutherland next claims that his post-Miranda confession\r                                                                \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Furthermore, after the two passengers were removed from the\r\nvehicle, the  female immediately  consented  to a  search of  her\r\npurse, which  was found to contain  $2,300 in $20 bills.   As the\r\ndistrict court considered  the evidence seized from  the purse in\r\narriving at its probable cause determination, it implicitly found\r\nthat the consensual search preceded Sutherland's arrest.  We find\r\nno  clear error.  See  United States v.  Martinez-Molina, 64 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n719, 726 (1st Cir. 1995).  \r\n\n     2Appellant vigorously insists that  the search of his person\r\nwhich occurred  at roadside,  after  the police  pulled down  his\r\ntrousers  to  inhibit his  movement, invalidated  his warrantless\r\narrest.   We  have  been presented  with  no reasoned  basis  for\r\nconcluding that  a brief roadside protective  search for weapons,\r\nsee Terry  v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1,  26 (1968), undermined the arrest\r                                                                           \r\nitself,  particularly  since  the  roadside  search  disclosed no\r                \r\nevidence. \r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nwas involuntary, since he was undergoing heroin withdrawal at the\r\n\ntime, such that  a promise  the police made  to provide him  with\r\n\nmethadone treatment was tantamount to coercion.  An unimpeachable\r\n\ndistrict court finding  conclusively undermines the  involuntari-\r\n\nness  claim.  After  hearing conflicting testimony  as to whether\r\n\nSutherland  had  been promised  methadone  treatments, the  court\r\n\naccepted the version  provided by  the police.   Thus, there  can\r\n\nhave been no clear error.   United States v. Valle, 72  F.3d 210,\r                                                            \r\n\n214 (1st Cir. 1995) (trial judge's credibility choice between two\r\n\nplausible versions of the events cannot be clearly erroneous).  \r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                    Affirmed\r                            \r\n\n                                4\r\r\n",

An unimpeachable\r\n\ndistrict court finding  conclusively undermines the  involuntari-\r\n\nness  claim.  After  hearing conflicting testimony  as to whether\r\n\nSutherland  had  been promised  methadone  treatments, the  court\r\n\naccepted the version  provided by  the police.
