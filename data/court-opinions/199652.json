Raymond L. Acosta, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                      Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n                   and Fusté*, District Judge.\n\n\n\n\n    *\n     Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.\n\f          Harry Anduze Montaño on brief for appellant.\n          David P. Freedman, Edgardo Rodriguez-Quilichini, and\nO'Neill & Borges on brief for appellee.\n\n                     ____________________\n\n                       October 24, 2001\n                     ____________________\n\n\n\n\n                              -2-\n\f            Per Curiam.      On December 4, 2000, the district court\n\nentered judgment, jointly and severally, in the amount of $7,368,645.21\n\nplus costs and interest against Denisse de Mauret-Rúa, her husband,\n\nMilton J. Rúa, and their conjugal partnership. On December 21, 2000,\n\nthe defendant Mrs. Rúa moved, pursuant to Rule 59(e) of the Federal\n\nRules of Civil Procedure, to amend the judgment with respect to her own\n\npersonal liability.       An order was entered denying the motion for\n\namendment on January 24, 2001, and she filed a notice of appeal on\n\nFebruary 20, 2001. The appeal appears to be from both the denial of the\n\nmotion to amend and the judgment. Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(iv). Our\n\nreview of a denial of a motion to amend judgment under Rule 59(e) is\n\nfor abuse of discretion. Vasapolli v. Rostoff, 39 F.3d 27, 36 (1st\n\nCir. 1994).\n\n            The essence of Mrs. Rua’s claim is that whatever the\n\nliability of her husband and the conjugal partnership for the judgment,\n\nthere was no basis for entry of judgment against her in a personal\n\ncapacity.    The district court denied the motion for amendment of\n\njudgment saying \"objections to the bankruptcy judge’s proposed findings\n\nof fact and conclusions of law may not be raised for the first time at\n\nthis late stage of the proceedings.\" Not only did Mrs. Rúa fail to\n\nraise this objection in a timely fashion to the district court after\n\nthe bankruptcy judge issued his proposed findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law, but she also failed to raise this objection before\n\nthe bankruptcy judge during the adversary proceeding. She did not even\n\nraise the issue in her answer. In fact, in the many years that this\n\n                                   -3-\n\fcase and related proceedings have been pending, Mrs. Rúa failed ever to\n\nraise the objection (that she could not be held personally liable) at\n\nany time before her motion to amend the judgment.\n\n            The district court order denying the motion for amendment of\n\njudgment was eminently correct. Mrs. Rúa has waived this argument by\n\nnot presenting it earlier. United States v. Slade, 980 F.2d 27, 30\n\n(1st Cir. 1992). There was no abuse of discretion here. The judgment\n\nstands because Mrs. Rua never presented this objection to the\n\nbankruptcy court or district court in a timely fashion.\n\n            Both the judgment and the denial of the motion to amend are\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f",
