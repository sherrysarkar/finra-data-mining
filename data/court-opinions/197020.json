The\r\n\nbankruptcy  court concluded  that  the Maine  superior  court\r\n\ndecision underlying the civil judgment  collaterally estopped\r\n\nMaloney from relitigating whether  his conduct in  assaulting\r\n\nappellee after murdering her  male companion was \"willful and\r\n\nmalicious\" within the meaning of    523(a)(6).2  The superior\r                                                          2\r\n\ncourt issued a four page decision which detailed its findings\r\n\nof fact and  conclusions of  law, which we  will not  recount\r\n\nhere.  For  our purposes it  is sufficient  to note that  the\r\n\nsuperior  court specifically found that Maloney had committed\r\n\na  \"vicious  assault\"  that was  \"unmistakably  calculated to\r\n\ncause  great anguish\" to appellee and that Maloney had spared\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   111 U.S.C.     523(a)(6) bars  a debtor  from obtaining  a\r               1\r\ndischarge of any  debt \"for willful  and malicious injury  by\r\nthe  debtor to another entity  or to the  property of another\r\nentity.\"\r\n\n   2Maloney  is  presently  serving a  30-year  sentence  for\r               2\r\nmurder  and aggravated assault as a result of the events that\r\ngave rise to the civil tort judgment.\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nappellee's  life in order to witness her anguish at the death\r\n\nof her companion.3\r                             3\r\n\n     Under both  Maine and federal  law, collateral  estoppel\r\n\nwill bar a litigant from relitigating an issue if, in a prior\r\n\nproceeding,  the  issue  was:  (1)  actually  litigated,  (2)\r\n\ndetermined  by   a  valid,   final  judgment,  and   (3)  the\r\n\ndetermination is essential  to the judgment.

See  3  Collier  on  Bankruptcy,\r                                                                        \r\n\n 523.16[1], at 523-12 (citing H. R. Rep.

But see Wood v. Dealers Financial Services,\r                                                                        \r\n    B.R.    , No.  95-40447, 1996 WESTLAW 434430  (E.D.

As  the principles of\r\ncollateral  estoppel are the same under Maine law and federal\r\nlaw, we need not decide which controls. \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nharbored a specific intent  to injure appellee, therefore his\r\n\nconduct was \"malicious\" under  either the implied malice test\r\n\nthat this court has applied in the past, see In re Nance, 556\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d  602, 611  (1st Cir.  1977), or  the specific  and other\r\n\nmalice  tests more  recently  employed by  other courts,  see\r                                                                         \r\n\nPiccuto  v.

As  the superior  court's decision\r\n\nestablished  that   Maloney's   conduct  was   \"willful   and\r\n\nmalicious\"  within the  meaning  of  523(a)(6)  and that  the\r\n\nother  prerequisites for  applying  collateral  estoppel  are\r\n\npresent, the  bankruptcy court properly held  that Maloney is\r\n\nbarred from relitigating these issues now.\r\n\n     On  appeal, Maloney  argues  that  the bankruptcy  court\r\n\nerred by applying collateral estoppel without first reviewing\r\n\nthe  transcript of  his state  trial.   He contends  that the\r\n\ntranscript  would show  that  the issues  of willfulness  and\r\n\nmaliciousness were  not fully  and fairly litigated  in state\r\n\ncourt  because  his defense  attorney  failed  to present  an\r\n\nadequate defense.5  As Maloney did not assert this particular\r                             5\r\n\nobjection  in the bankruptcy court, it is not properly before\r\n\nus.  See In re Menna, 16  F.3d 7, 9 n.2 (1st Cir. 1994). Even\r                                \r\n\nif it were, Maloney would not  prevail, for it was his burden\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   5Maloney specifically complains  that his attorney  waived\r               5\r\nhis right to trial  by jury without his knowledge  or consent\r\nand  failed  to  present  evidence, which  Maloney  does  not\r\ndescribe.     \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nto produce  the transcript as the  party resisting collateral\r\n\nestoppel. See Van Houten v. Harco Const., Inc., 655 A.2d 331,\r                                                          \r\n\n333-34 (Me. 1995); Hossler  v. Barry, 403 A.2d 762,  769 (Me.\r                                                \r\n\n1979)(party  resisting  collateral  estoppel  has  burden  of\r\n\nproving  prejudice).    As   Maloney  failed  to  submit  the\r\n\ntranscript  (indeed,  the record  suggests  that  he did  not\r\n\nattempt to secure  it until after  judgment was entered),  he\r\n\nfailed to meet his  burden of proof, and the entry of summary\r\n\njudgment for appellee was proper. See In re Menna, 16 F.3d at\r                                                             \r\n\n9  (\"'[a]s to any essential  factual element of  its claim on\r\n\nwhich  the nonmovant would bear the burden of proof at trial,\r\n\nits  failure  to come  forward  with  sufficient evidence  to\r\n\ngenerate a trialworthy issue warrants summary judgment to the\r\n\nmoving party'\"(citations omitted)).6    Maloney  also  claims\r                                               6\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   6We note that in the context of cases in which the precise\r               6\r\ngrounds of a  prior state court  judgment were unclear,  some\r\ncircuits have required bankruptcy courts to review the entire\r\nrecord  of   the  state  trial  before   applying  collateral\r\nestoppel. See, e.g.,  Wheeler v. Laudani,  783 F.2d 610,  615\r                                                    \r\n(6th  Cir. 1986); Spilman v.  Harley, 656 F.2d  224, 228 (6th\r                                                \r\nCir. 1981);  Matter of Ross, 602 F.2d 604, 605-08 &amp; n. 10 (3d\r                                       \r\nCir. 1979).  We  do not think that such  review is invariably\r\nrequired where, as here, the portion of the  record submitted\r\nby the appellee  makes out  a prima facie  case for  applying\r\ncollateral estoppel.  Cf. Combs v. Richardson,  838 F.2d 112,\r                                                         \r\n113-17 (4th Cir. 1988)(applying collateral estoppel based  on\r\nreview of  jury instructions and verdict).   Moreover, review\r\nof the transcript was not necessary because even if Maloney's\r\nassertion that  defense counsel was inadequate  is true, \"the\r\ngeneral  rule  is  that  'ignorance  or  carelessness  of  an\r\nattorney'  does  not  provide a  basis  for  relief from  the\r\neffects  of an adverse civil judgment.\" In re Braen, 900 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n621, 629 (3d Cir. 1990) (citation omitted), cert. denied, 498\r                                                                    \r\nU.S. 1066 (1991).   \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nthat  the bankruptcy court denied him the right to submit the\r\n\ntranscript by issuing its  ruling before the 60-day discovery\r\n\nperiod that had been  set by a pretrial scheduling  order had\r\n\nexpired.  The  point is meritless,  for the record  discloses\r\n\nthat  the  discovery  period  expired on  the  day  that  the\r\n\nbankruptcy court  issued its  decision. Moreover,  this claim\r\n\nhas also been  waived, for  Maloney did not  protest that  he\r\n\nrequired  further  time  to  complete  discovery  during  the\r\n\nhearing on appellee's motion for summary judgment.  See In re\r                                                                         \r\n\nCress, 106 B.R. 246,  248 (D.

As  both of  Maloney's arguments  on\r\n\nappeal  are  meritless  and  the  application  of  collateral\r\n\nestoppel  otherwise  appears  proper,  the  judgment  of  the\r\n\ndistrict court is affirmed.\r                                      \r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n",

These findings also establish that Maloney harbored a specific intent to injure appellee, therefore his conduct was \"malicious\" under either the implied malice test that this court has applied in the past,  see In re Nance, 556 F.2d 602, 611 (1st Cir.1977), or the specific and other malice tests more recently employed by other courts,  see Piccuto v. Dwyer, 39 F.3d 37, 41 &amp; n. 3 (1st Cir.1994)(collecting cases).  As the superior court's decision established that Maloney's conduct was \"willful and malicious\" within the meaning of &#167; 523(a)(6) and that the other prerequisites for applying collateral estoppel are present, the bankruptcy court properly held that Maloney is barred from relitigating these issues now.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Maloney argues that the bankruptcy court erred by applying collateral estoppel without first reviewing the transcript of his state trial.  He contends that the transcript would show that the issues of willfulness and maliciousness were not fully and fairly litigated in state court because his defense attorney failed to present an adequate defense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  As Maloney did not assert this particular objection in the bankruptcy court, it is not properly before us.   See In re Menna, 16 F.3d 7, 9 n. 2 (1st Cir.1994).  Even if it were, Maloney would not prevail, for it was his burden to produce the transcript as the party resisting collateral estoppel.   See Van Houten v. Harco Const., Inc., 655 A.2d 331, 333-34 (Me.1995);   Hossler v. Barry, 403 A.2d 762, 769 (Me.1979)(party resisting collateral estoppel has burden of proving prejudice).  As Maloney failed to submit the transcript (indeed, the record suggests that he did not attempt to secure it until after judgment was entered), he failed to meet his burden of proof, and the entry of summary judgment for appellee was proper.   See In re Menna, 16 F.3d at 9 (\" '[a]s to any essential factual element of its claim on which the nonmovant would bear the burden of proof at trial, its failure to come forward with sufficient evidence to generate a trialworthy issue warrants summary judgment to the moving party' \"(citations omitted)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maloney also claims that the bankruptcy court denied him the right to submit the transcript by issuing its ruling before the 60-day discovery period that had been set by a pretrial scheduling order had expired.  The point is meritless, for the record discloses that the discovery period expired on the day that the bankruptcy court issued its decision.  Moreover, this claim has also been waived, for Maloney did not protest that he required further time to complete discovery during the hearing on appellee's motion for summary judgment.

The bankruptcy court concluded that the Maine superior court decision underlying the civil judgment collaterally estopped Maloney from relitigating whether his conduct in assaulting appellee after murdering her male companion was \"willful and malicious\" within the meaning of &#167; 523(a)(6).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The superior court issued a four page decision which detailed its findings of fact and conclusions of law, which we will not recount here.  For our purposes it is sufficient to note that the superior court specifically found that Maloney had committed a \"vicious assault\" that was \"unmistakably calculated to cause great anguish\" to appellee and that Maloney had spared appellee's life in order to witness her anguish at the death of her companion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under both Maine and federal law, collateral estoppel will bar a litigant from relitigating an issue if, in a prior proceeding, the issue was:  (1) actually litigated, (2) determined by a valid, final judgment, and (3) the determination is essential to the judgment.
