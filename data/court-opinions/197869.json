Mark L. Wolf, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n               Stahl and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\nDavid James Wyatt on brief pro se.\r\nMalcolm S. Medley, Special Assistant Corporation Counsel, on\r\nbrief for appellees.\r\n\n                                         \r\n                       March 26, 1998\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n       Per Curiam.      This is an appeal from a jury verdict\r\nin favor of defendant, the City of Boston.  Plaintiff David\r\nJames Wyatt was terminated from his teaching position in the\r\nBoston public schools and then filed a complaint under  704(a)\r\nof Title VII in the Massachusetts district court.  Plaintiff\r\nessentially claimed that the City had retaliated against him\r\nfor filing charges with the Massachusetts Commission Against\r\nDiscrimination concerning sexual harassment.  See 42 U.S.C. \r\n2000e-3(a).  Plaintiff raises essentially two arguments on\r\nappeal and we reject both of them.\r\n         1.  Plaintiff's first argument is that because the\r\nCity could not show that it had terminated him for a valid\r\nreason under the collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\")\r\nbetween the City and the teachers, the City could not rebut the\r\npresumption that it had acted unlawfully.  For this\r\nproposition, plaintiff relies on King v. Illinois Bell Tel.\r\nCo., 476 F.Supp. 495 (N.D.Ill. 1978).  Even assuming arguendo\r\nthat this court would follow King in the same factual setting,\r\nKing would not apply here, however, because it addresses a\r\ndifferent stage of the Title VII analysis from the one involved\r\nin this case.\r\n         Specifically, the district court in King was\r\nconcerned with whether the plaintiff could make a prima facie\r\ncase of retaliation -- i.e., whether he could show that he had\r\nengaged in activity protected by Title VII.  Because the\r\nconduct in which the plaintiff had engaged violated the\r\ncollective bargaining agreement, the district court held that\r\nit was not protected.  Id. at 501.  Here, in contrast,\r\nplaintiff already has made a prima facie case and thus there is\r\nno question concerning whether the activities in which he had\r\nengaged were protected.  Rather, plaintiff is focussing on the\r\nsecond step in the Title VII analysis -- whether the City has\r\nshown legitimate reasons for its actions.  King simply does not\r\nspeak to the relevance of a collective bargaining agreement in\r\nanswering this question.\r\n         Plaintiff cites no other cases in support of his\r\nposition that unless an employer can show a dismissal\r\naccomplished within the terms of a collective bargaining\r\nagreement, the employer has not articulated a non-\r\ndiscriminatory reason for its actions.  This is not surprising\r\nbecause plaintiff's position does not hold water. \r\nSpecifically, plaintiff misunderstands what constitutes\r\n\"unlawful\" action under Title VII.\r\n         Courts refer to unlawful action at the second step of\r\nTitle VII analysis.  When a plaintiff has made out a prima\r\nfacie case, an inference is raised that the employer\r\n\"unlawfully discriminated against the employee.\"  See St.\r\nMary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 506 (1993) (internal\r\nquotation marks and citation omitted; emphasis added).  Hence\r\nthe requirement that the employer articulate a \"legitimate,\r\nnondiscriminatory reason\" for its action.  See id. at 507\r\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted; emphasis\r\nadded).\r\n         As applied to this case, then, once plaintiff made a\r\nprima facie case, the presumption arose that the City had\r\nretaliated against him for his complaints of sexual harassment. \r\nThe burden shifted to the City to articulate, not that its\r\nreasons for dismissing plaintiff were within the CBA, but\r\nrather that the reasons were non-retaliatory, whether or notthey were \"CBA-valid.\"  That the City met this burden is plain\r\nfrom the evidence submitted at trial.  The burden of showing\r\ndiscrimination rests always on the plaintiff and he has not met\r\nhis burden.\r\n         2.     Plaintiff argues that a judgment entered in a\r\ncase he initiated in Suffolk Superior Court was conclusive,\r\nunder the doctrine of res judicata, as to the City's liability\r\nunder Title VII.  However, the City states, and plaintiff does\r\nnot dispute, that the default judgment has since been removed. \r\nThus, res judicata does not apply.\r\n         For the foregoing reasons, all of the district\r\ncourt's rulings were correct and we therefore affirm the\r\njudgment of that court.  Plaintiff's motion for summary\r\ndisposition is denied as moot, as is his motion for the trial\r\ntranscript to be produced at government expense.\r\n",
