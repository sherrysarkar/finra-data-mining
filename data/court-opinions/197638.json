Upon careful  review  of the  briefs  and\r                           \r\n\nrecord presented in this appeal,  we perceive no error in the\r\n\nweapons  adjustment,  U.S.S.G.      2D1.1(b)(1),  applied  in\r\n\ncalculating  defendant's  sentence.     That  adjustment  was\r\n\nadequately supported  by  the  government's  version  of  the\r\n\nfacts,  to which  defendant admitted.    Defendant's argument\r\n\nthat he did  not possess the weapon \"in  connection with\" the\r\n\ndrug  transaction is unsupported by the appellate record, and\r\n\nwe will not  disturb the  district court's  findings in  that\r\n\nregard.   Further, given the differing circumstances in which\r\n\ndefendant and  his co-defendant were  arrested, charged,  and\r\n\npled, we cannot conclude that the differing sentences imposed\r\n\nupon  them amounted  to error.   Thus  we reject  defendant's\r\n\nequal protection  argument, as well  as his argument  that he\r\n\nshould  qualify for  safety  valve  relief  because  his  co-\r\n\ndefendant did so.\r\n\n     Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r                               \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n",
