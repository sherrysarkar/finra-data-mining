  "plain_text": "[NOT FOR PUBLICATION--NOT TO BE CITED AS PRECEDENT]\r\n\nUnited States Court of Appeals\r\nFor the First Circuit\r\n\n\nNo. 97-2303\r\n\nUNITED STATES,\r\n\nAppellee,\r\n\nv.\r\n\nLEON ABRAMS,\r\nA/K/A LEON L. ABRAM, A/K/A ANTHONY HALL,\r\n\nDefendant, Appellant.\r\n\n\n\nAPPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n[Hon. William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n\n\nBefore\r\n\nTorruella, Chief Judge,\r\n\nWellford, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\nand Lynch, Circuit Judge. \r\n\n\n\nTracy A. Miner, by appointment of the Court, Michael F.\r\nConnolly, John F. Sylvia, Andrew Nathanson and Mintz, Levin, Cohn,\r\nFerris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C. on brief, for appellant.\r\nDonald K. Stern, United States Attorney, and Ben T. Clements,\r\nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief, for appellee.\r\n\n\nAugust 3, 1998\r\n\n        Per Curiam.  Following a jury trial, Leon Abrams was\r\nconvicted of possessing with intent to distribute cocaine base in\r\nviolation of 21 U.S.C.  841(a)(1), and of being a felon in\r\npossession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C.  922(g).  At the\r\ntime of his conviction, Abrams qualified as a career offender under\r\nU.S.S.G.  4B1.1.  However, Abrams sought and obtained continuances\r\nprior to his sentencing in order to collaterally attack his prior\r\nstate court convictions.  Eventually a Massachusetts trial court\r\nvacated Abrams' 1984 manslaughter conviction on grounds unrelated\r\nto guilt.  As a result of that decision, Abrams no longer qualified\r\nas a career offender under  4B1.1 during his sentencing.\r\nDespite the fact that Abrams' underlying manslaughter\r\nconviction had been vacated, the district court departed upwards in\r\nsentencing him, from 78 to 204 months, pursuant to a U.S.S.G\r\n4A1.3 and 5K2.0 criminal history departure.  The district court\r\nconcluded that Abrams' criminal history category and sentencing\r\nguideline range did not adequately reflect his status as a de factocareer offender.  On appeal, Abrams argues that this departure was\r\nunwarranted because the court lacked \"reliable information\" that\r\nAbrams committed the 1984 manslaughter.\r\nHowever, after Abrams filed his brief in this court, the\r\nMassachusetts Appeals Court reversed the trial court's vacation of\r\nhis 1984 manslaughter conviction, and reinstated the conviction. \r\nSee Commonwealth v. Abrams, 692 N.E.2d 532 (Mass. App. Ct. 1998). \r\nThat decision has not been appealed.  Thus, there is now a valid\r\nand final conviction for every crime on which the district court\r\nbased its upward departure.\r\nIf Abrams were re-sentenced in this case, it would be\r\nunder U.S.S.G.  4B1.1., because the brief window of time during\r\nwhich he did not technically qualify as a career criminal is now\r\nclosed.  The district court would be required to sentence Abrams to\r\nat least 210 months, six more than his current sentence.  Thus,\r\nAbrams' appeal has been effectively mooted by the reinstatement of\r\nhis 1984 manslaughter conviction.  In any event,  Abrams' argument\r\nthat the district court lacked \"reliable information\" that Abrams\r\ncommitted the 1984 manslaughter is rejected upon our taking\r\njudicial notice of the intervening Commonwealth v. Abrams, 692\r\nN.E.2d 532 (Mass. App. Ct. 1998).  Abrams' sentence is therefore\r\naffirmed.\n",
