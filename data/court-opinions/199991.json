Under   the   authority of the\n\nMagnuson-Stevens Act, 16 U.S.C. 1801, the Department of Commerce\n\nformulated    a    series   of   plans    and   regulations   to    protect   the\n\ndwindling stock of groundfish in the Gulf of Maine. These included\n\nclosing certain areas to fishing.               Appellant, The Gulf of Maine\n\nFishermen's Alliance (\"GMFA\"), is an association of commercial\n\nfishermen who have been severely impacted by the regulations and\n\nclosures.     They challenged in the district court one such set of\n\nrules and plans known as \"Framework 25\"; they challenge in this\n\ncourt the district judge's dismissal of the case on mootness\n\ngrounds.     We affirm.\n\n             Congress passed the Magnuson-Stevens Act in 1976 for the\npurpose of \"promot[ing] domestic, commercial, and recreational\nfishing\" while conserving precious fishing resources.                 16 U.S.C.\n\n1801(b)(1) and (3).         The Act established eight Regional Fishery\nManagement Councils responsible for developing fishery management\nplans (\"FMPs\") in their regions.\n\n             The   New    England   Fisheries      Management      Council    (the\n\"NEFMC\") promulgated the first Northeast Multispecies Fisheries\nManagement Plan in 1985 in an effort to curb the decline of\n\ngroundfish stock in the Gulf of Maine.             Between 1985 and 1996, the\nPlan underwent a series of amendments as the groundfish population\nin that region continued to suffer.               Finally, in 1996, with the\n\npopulation of cod and other groundfish on the verge of collapse,\nthe Commerce Department instituted a new \"Framework\" rulemaking\nprocedure which allowed the regional regulatory authorities to\n\namend inshore fishing regulations \"at any time,\" thereby responding\n\n                                         -2-\n\fmore quickly to fluctuations in the groundfish population.              Under\n\nthis new, abbreviated procedure, the regional councils are able to\n\nadjust their fishing restrictions over the span of two regular\nmonthly meetings, but they must provide timely public notice of any\n\nproposed change in regulations and invite public comment prior to\n\nand at the second meeting.\n          Framework 25, the first of the \"Framework\" regulations\n\npromulgated by the NEFMC, was developed in late 1997.          Among other\n\nthings, the regulation instituted a year-round closure of an\n\ninshore fishing area known as Jeffrey's Ledge, as well as a series\n\nof \"rolling closures\" along the Gulf of Maine which were intended\n\nto spread the impact of the fishing restrictions across several\n\nports.   These closures were to expire after three years.\n             On November 19, 1997, NEFMC mailed a notice to 1650\n\ninterested    parties   alerting   them   that   Framework   25   would    be\n\ndiscussed at the regular council meeting on December 9, 1997.             The\nNEFMC also filed a meeting notice with the Office of the Federal\n\nRegister on November 24, 1997, but it was not published until\n\nNovember 29, 1997, less than 14 days before the meeting date.\n\nFinally, on December 2, 1997, the NEFMC issued a press release\n\nabout the declining groundfish stock, the proposed regulation, and\n\nthe upcoming council meeting.\n\n             Several individual GMFA members did not receive notice of\n\nthe meeting; however, most did, and representatives from GMFA\n\nattended the December 9, 1997 meeting.            They objected to the\n\nproposed regulation on behalf of the GMFA members and presented a\n\ncounterproposal     which   they   claimed   would   achieve      the    same\n\n                                   -3-\n\fconservation goals at a lower cost to inshore fishing fleets.              The\n\nNEFMC considered their proposal, but chose to adopt its own version\n\nof Framework 25 at the next council meeting on January 14-15, 1998.\n            Soon thereafter, GMFA filed this suit to enjoin the\n\nenforcement of Framework 25.       The group challenged the regulation\n\non both procedural and substantive grounds, arguing that it should\nbe set aside because (1) the NEFMC failed to comply with statutory\n\nnotice and comment requirements, and (2) Framework 25 was not the\n\nbest course of action available to achieve the stated conservation\n\ngoals while minimizing the impact on small inshore fleets.                 Both\n\nparties moved for summary judgment and while these motions were\n\npending, the NEFMC adopted Framework 27, a new FMP which expanded\n\nupon Framework 25 by increasing the size and duration of the\nrolling closures.       On motion of defendant, the district court then\n\ndismissed the action challenging Framework 25 as moot.              It ruled\n\nthat the procedural failures that had occurred in the adoption of\nFramework   25   were    not   likely   to   be   repeated,   and   that    the\n\nsubstantive challenges, to the extent that they were still relevant\n\nafter the adoption of Framework 27, could be reviewed in a case\n\nchallenging that FMP\n\n            Framework 27 was adopted on May 5, 1999, after a notice\n\nand comment period which included two public hearings and timely\n\npublication in the Federal Register. GMFA filed a separate lawsuit\n\nchallenging Framework 27 on substantive grounds, but did not\n\ncontest the new regulation on procedural grounds because the notice\n\nand comment process had been sufficient.\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f          Since 1999, the NEFMC has adopted several more FMPs. Two\n\nof these, Framework 31 and Framework 33, addressed and either\n\nmodified or maintained the closures and groundfish trip limits in\nthe Gulf of Maine and Jeffrey's Ledge, issues previously governed\n\nby Framework 25.   GMFA does not contend that the NEFMC violated\n\nprocedural rules in the adoption of these or any other FMP since\nFramework 25.\n\n          The questions before us are first, whether appellants'\n\nclaims of invalidity are moot since Framework 25 is no longer in\n\neffect; and second, whether they fall within the narrow exception\n\nfor claims that are \"capable of repetition, yet evading review.\"\n\nS.Pac. Terminal Co. v. ICC. 219 U.S. 498, 515 (1911).\"\n\n          We have consistently held that \"a case becomes moot 'when\nthe issues presented are no longer \"live\" or the parties lack a\n\nlegally cognizable interest in the outcome of the controversy.'\"\n\nThomas R.W. v. Mass. Dept. of Educ., 130 F.3d 477, 479 (1st Cir.\n\n1997) (quoting Boston and Me. Corp. v. Bhd. of Maintenance of Way\n\nEmployees, 94 F.3d 15, 20 (1st Cir. 1996)).\n\n          A party can have no legally cognizable interest in the\n\noutcome of a case if the court is not capable of providing any\n\nrelief which will redress the alleged injury.    Thus, \"if an event\n\noccurs while a case is pending ... that makes it impossible for the\n\ncourt to grant any effectual relief whatever to a prevailing party,\n\nthe [action] must be dismissed.\"     Church of Scientology v. United\n\nStates, 506 U.S. 9, 12 (1992) (internal citations omitted).     The\n\npromulgation of new regulations and amendment of old regulations\n\n\n                               -5-\n\fare among such intervening events as can moot a challenge to the\n\nregulation in its original form.            Save Our Cumberland Mountains,\n\nInc. v. Clark, 725 F.2d 1422, 1432 n.27 (D.C. Cir. 1984). (\"There\nis no question that a case can be mooted by promulgation of new\n\nregulations or by amendment or revocation of old regulations.\");\n\nsee also Natural     Res.    Def.    Council    v.   United    States   Nuclear\n\nRegulatory     Comm'n,      680     F.2d     810,    813-815     (D.C.    Cir.\n\n1982)(procedural challenge to a regulation promulgated in violation\n\nof notice and comment requirements rendered moot by repromulgation\n\nof rule in accordance with procedural requirements).\n\n             Here, the appellant asks us to invalidate Framework 25,\n\na regulation which is no longer in effect because it has been\n\nreplaced by a series of subsequent Frameworks.            This court has no\nmeans of redressing either procedural failures or substantive\n\ndeficiencies associated with a regulation that is now defunct.               In\n\neffect, those deficiencies have been eliminated by the promulgation\nof new Frameworks in compliance with the applicable procedural\n\nguidelines and based on new circumstances and data concerning the\n\ngroundfish stock.\n\n             GMFA argues that the provision of Framework 25 which\n\nestablished a year-round closure at Jeffrey's Ledge is still in\n\neffect because it has not yet expired1 and has not been modified by\n\n     1\n       The Jeffrey's Ledge closure was originally scheduled to\nexpire on May 1, 2001, three years after it was enacted as part\nof Framework 25, effective May 1, 1998. Our decision post-dates\nthat expiration date. Given our conclusion that the provisions\nof Framework 25 at issue here were superceded by subsequent\nFrameworks, we need not consider whether the recent expiration of\nFramework 25 would provide an independent basis for our finding\n                                      -6-\n\fsubsequent Frameworks.          To the extent that this provision of\n\nFramework 25 is still operative, GMFA insists that we can declare\n\nit invalid.       Yet, the record is clear that the Jeffrey's Ledge\nclosure, although unmodified since enacted in Framework 25, was\n\nexpressly reconsidered and re-adopted in later Frameworks.                      See,\n\ne.g.,    64    Fed.     Reg.   14846    (proposed     Framework     27    fishing\nregulations);     64    Fed.   Reg.    24066    (Framework   27   as     enacted).\n\nTherefore, the section of Framework 25 governing that closure is no\n\nlonger   in    effect    because   fishing      in   Jeffrey's    Ledge    is   now\n\nregulated by later Frameworks which, in turn, are based on later\n\nand totally different data.\n\n              Since every measure introduced in Framework 25, including\n\nthe Jeffrey's Ledge closure, is now governed by a later Framework,\nno justiciable controversy exists regarding Framework 25, and the\n\nappellant's claims are moot.\n\n              There remains the second question, whether appellant's\nclaims, although moot, may still be actionable because defendant's\n\nactions are, by their nature, \"capable of repetition, yet evading\n\nreview.\"      Weinstein v. Bradford, 423 U.S. 147, 149 (1975).                   In\n\norder    to   qualify    for   this    narrow   exception    to   the     mootness\n\ndoctrine, a plaintiff must show that \"(1) the challenged action was\n\nin its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its\n\ncessation or expiration, and (2) there was a reasonable expectation\n\n\n\nof mootness. See, e.g., Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 125 (1973)\n(explaining that \"an actual controversy must exist at all stages\nof appellate . . . review, and not simply at the date the action\nis initiated\").\"\n                                        -7-\n\fthat the same complaining party would be subjected to the same\n\naction again.\"     Id; see also Thomas R.W., 130 F.3d at 479-480\n\n(applying the Weinstein test).\n            GMFA argues that, under the Framework system, FMPs are\n\ndeveloped   and   adopted   in    such    rapid    succession   that    it   is\n\nimpossible to challenge the validity of one Framework before the\nnext one is put into effect.       The difficulty with the argument is\n\nthat it is not supported by the facts.            GMFA has simply not shown\n\nthat \"the challenged action was in its duration too short to be\n\nfully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration.\"              Weinstein,\n\n423 U.S. at 149.     New fishing regulations are not promulgated so\n\nquickly under the Framework system that all timely legal challenges\n\nare inevitably precluded.        The system does permit the NEFMC to\nadopt new fishing regulations within a matter of months; but, in\n\npractice, most Frameworks governing the Western Gulf of Maine\n\nclosures (including Jeffrey's Ledge) are in place for as much as a\nyear before being superceded by a new Framework.\n\n            At least one Framework regulation has already been fully\n\nlitigated within that time frame.           Framework 33, published as a\n\nfinal rule on April 24, 2000, has governed the closure of Jeffrey's\n\nLedge for almost two years.        One month after that Framework was\n\nenacted,    a   municipality     affected    by    the   closures    filed    a\n\nsubstantive legal challenge in which the appellant, GMFA, filed an\n\namicus curae brief.    City of Gloucester v. Mineta, No. 00-11019REK\n\n(D. Mass. Nov. 15, 2000).         The judge in that case recommended\n\nexpedited review, and the litigation concluded less than six months\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\flater.     Thus, in only seven months, Framework 33 underwent a fully\n\nlitigated substantive legal challenge.\n\n             Framework 25, the regulation at issue before us, was\npromulgated as a final rule on March 31, 1998, effective May 1,\n\n1998, and was in force for more than a year before it was replaced\n\nby Framework 27 on May 5, 1999, affording appellant considerable\ntime to pursue its claims.      Furthermore, appellant never requested\n\nexpedited review during this litigation.            On the contrary, both\n\nparties     sought   numerous   extensions     of   time      for   filing    the\n\nadministrative record, motions, and briefs.             As a result of these\n\ndelays, we cannot know whether GMFA might have obtained a judgment\n\non   its   challenges   to   Framework    25   before   the    adoption      of   a\n\nsubsequent Framework rendered those challenges moot.                 Given the\nactual, as opposed to theoretical, interval between most Frameworks\n\nand the historical fact that review is indeed possible, we decline\n\nto hold that Framework 25 was \"too short in duration\" to be fully\nlitigated before its expiration.\n\n             Appellant fails as well to satisfy the second requirement\n\nof the Weinstein test.       Neither the procedural nor the substantive\n\ndeficiencies raised by appellant are likely to recur.\n\n             GMFA's procedural challenge to Framework 25 grew out of\n\nan admittedly insufficient notice and comment process during the\n\npromulgation of that regulation. Appellant urges that, absent some\n\ndeclaration by this court, the NEFMC's failure to adequately notify\n\ncertain interested parties of the proposed rule, and the consequent\n\ninability of those parties to comment on the rule prior to its\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fadoption, could easily be repeated in the adoption of future\n\nFrameworks.      Yet, GMFA concedes that the NEFMC has complied with\n\nthe   relevant    notice   and   comment   guidelines   in    adopting     all\nsubsequent Frameworks, and it has pointed to no evidence in the\n\nrecord which suggests that the procedural failures which occurred\n\nwith respect to Framework 25 will be repeated.          We thus affirm the\nDistrict Court's determination that GMFA's objections to procedural\n\ndeficiencies in the creation of Framework 25 are moot.\n\n            GMFA also challenges Framework 25 on substantive grounds;\n\nnamely, that the closures it mandated disproportionately impact\n\nsmall inshore fleets.      This defect in Framework 25, it contends,\n\nwill be repeated in subsequent frameworks because each builds upon\n\nthe closures and fishing limits established in prior ones. Thus is\nGMFA subjected to the same action by the NEFMC over and over.               We\n\ndisagree.\n\n            First,   the   later   Frameworks   do   not     depend   on   the\nprovisions incorporated in Framework 25.        They direct closures of\n\ndifferent size, location and duration. These modified closures and\n\nlimitations do not, therefore, constitute the \"same action\" with\n\nrespect to appellants. The very purpose of the Framework system is\n\nto adjust the fishing regulations frequently so that no fleet or\n\narea bears the entire burden of the fishing limitations.                   GMFA\n\nrepresents several fleets, and those fleets have been impacted\n\ndifferently by each subsequent Framework.            Because most of the\n\nlimitations imposed by Framework 25 are not identical to the\n\nlimitations imposed by later Frameworks, any mistakes in Framework\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\f25 will not recur in the later ones.\n\n            Second, even the provisions of Framework 25 which remain\n\nunchanged in later Frameworks, such as the year-round closure at\nJeffrey's   Ledge,     were    re-adopted        based   on   new,    updated     data\n\nconcerning the groundfish stock. Thus, the later Frameworks do not\n\nsubject the appellant to the same action because they involve an\n\nentirely new analysis.             Assuming, arguendo, that the Jeffrey's\n\nLedge closure in Framework 25 was found to be invalid as arbitrary\n\nand   capricious     under    the       strict   standard     set    forth   by    the\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706 (1996), that does not\nmean that the same closure, as adopted in Framework 27 or any other\n\nFramework, was arbitrary and capricious based on the new data\navailable   to   the   NEFMC       at   the   later   time.     Any    substantive\ndeficiencies in Framework 25 are thus not likely to be repeated.\n\n            We   AFFIRM      the    District      Court's     dismissal      of    the\n\nappellant's claims as moot.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\f",

Both parties moved for summary judgment and while these motions were pending, the NEFMC adopted Framework 27, a new FMP which expanded upon Framework 25 by increasing the size and duration of the rolling closures. On motion of defendant, the district court then dismissed the action challenging Framework 25 as moot.

This court has no means of redressing either procedural failures or substantive deficiencies associated with a regulation that is now defunct. In effect, those deficiencies have been eliminated by the promulgation of new Frameworks in compliance with the applicable procedural guidelines and based on new circumstances and data concerning the groundfish stock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GMFA argues that the provision of Framework 25 which established a year-round closure at Jeffrey's Ledge is still in effect because it has not yet expired<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and has not been modified by subsequent Frameworks. To the extent that this provision of Framework 25 is still operative, GMFA insists that we can declare it invalid. Yet, the record is clear that the Jeffrey's Ledge closure, although unmodified since enacted in Framework 25, was expressly reconsidered and re-adopted in later Frameworks. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 64 Fed.Reg. 14846 (proposed Framework 27 fishing regulations); 64 Fed.Reg. 24066 (Framework 27 as enacted). Therefore, the section of Framework 25 governing that closure is no longer in effect because fishing in Jeffrey's Ledge is now regulated by later Frameworks which, in turn, are based on later and totally different data.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since every measure introduced in Framework 25, including the Jeffrey's Ledge closure, is now governed by a later Framework, no justiciable controversy exists regarding Framework 25, and the appellant's claims are moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There remains the second question, whether appellant's claims, although moot, may still be actionable because defendant's actions are, by their nature, \"capable of repetition, yet evading review.\" <i>Weinstein v. Bradford,</i> 423 U.S. 147, 149, 96 S.Ct. 347, 46 L.Ed.2d 350 (1975). In order to qualify for this narrow exception to the mootness doctrine, a plaintiff must show that \"(1) the challenged action was in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration, and (2) there was a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party would be subjected to the same action again.\" <i>Id; see also Thomas R.W.,</i> 130 F.3d at 479-480 (applying the <i>Weinstein</i> test).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GMFA argues that, under the Framework system, FMPs are developed and adopted in such rapid succession that it is impossible to challenge the validity of one Framework before the next one is put into effect. The difficulty with the argument is that it is not supported by the facts. GMFA has simply not shown that \"the challenged action was in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration.\" <i>Weinstein,</i> 423 U.S. at 149, 96 S.Ct. 347. New fishing regulations are not promulgated so quickly under the Framework system that all timely legal challenges are inevitably precluded. The system does permit the NEFMC to adopt new fishing regulations within a matter of months; but, in practice, most Frameworks governing the Western Gulf of Maine closures (including Jeffrey's Ledge) are in place for as much as a year before being superceded by a new Framework.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At least one Framework regulation has already been fully litigated within that time frame. Framework 33, published as a final rule on April 24, 2000, has governed the closure of Jeffrey's Ledge for almost two years. One month after that Framework was enacted, a municipality affected by the closures filed a substantive legal challenge in which the appellant, GMFA, filed an amicus curiae brief. <i>City of Gloucester v. Mineta,</i> No. 00-11019REK (D.Mass. Nov. 15, 2000). The judge in that case recommended expedited review, and the litigation concluded less than six months later. Thus, in only seven months, Framework 33 underwent a fully litigated substantive legal challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Framework 25, the regulation at issue before us, was promulgated as a final rule on March 31, 1998, effective May 1, 1998, and was in force for more than a year before it was replaced by Framework 27 on May 5, 1999, affording appellant considerable time to pursue its claims. Furthermore, appellant never requested expedited review during this litigation. On the contrary, both parties sought numerous extensions of time for filing the administrative record, motions, and briefs. As a result of these delays, we cannot know whether GMFA might have obtained a judgment on its challenges to Framework 25 before the adoption of a subsequent Framework rendered those challenges moot. Given the actual, as opposed to theoretical, interval between most Frameworks and the historical fact that review is indeed possible, we decline to hold that Framework 25 was \"too short in duration\" to be fully litigated before its expiration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant fails as well to satisfy the second requirement of the <i>Weinstein</i> test. Neither the procedural nor the substantive deficiencies raised by appellant are likely to recur.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GMFA's procedural challenge to Framework 25 grew out of an admittedly insufficient notice and comment process during the promulgation of that regulation. Appellant urges that, absent some declaration by this court, the NEFMC's failure to adequately notify certain interested parties of the proposed rule, and the consequent inability of those parties to comment on the rule prior to its adoption, could easily be repeated in the adoption of future Frameworks. Yet, GMFA concedes that the NEFMC has complied with the relevant notice and comment guidelines in adopting all subsequent Frameworks, and it has pointed to no evidence in the record which suggests that the procedural failures which occurred with respect to Framework 25 will be repeated. We thus affirm the District Court's determination that GMFA's objections to procedural deficiencies in the creation of Framework 25 are moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GMFA also challenges Framework 25 on substantive grounds; namely, that the closures it mandated disproportionately impact small inshore fleets. This defect in Framework 25, it contends, will be repeated in subsequent frameworks because each builds upon the closures and fishing limits established in prior ones. Thus is GMFA subjected to the same action by the NEFMC over and over. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the later Frameworks do not depend on the provisions incorporated in Framework 25. They direct closures of different size, location and duration. These modified closures and limitations do not, therefore, constitute the \"same action\" with respect to appellants. The very purpose of the Framework system is to adjust the fishing regulations frequently so that no fleet or area bears the entire burden of the fishing limitations. GMFA represents several fleets, and those fleets have been impacted differently by each subsequent Framework. Because most of the limitations imposed by Framework 25 are not identical to the limitations imposed by later Frameworks, any mistakes in Framework 25 will not recur in the later ones.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, even the provisions of Framework 25 which remain unchanged in later Frameworks, such as the year-round closure at Jeffrey's Ledge, were re-adopted based on new, updated data concerning the groundfish stock. Thus, the later Frameworks do not subject the appellant to the same action because they involve an entirely new analysis. Assuming, <i>arguendo,</i> that the Jeffrey's Ledge closure in Framework 25 was found to be invalid as arbitrary and capricious under the strict standard set forth by the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 706 (1996), that does not mean that the same closure, as adopted in Framework 27 or any other Framework, was arbitrary and capricious based on the new data available to the NEFMC at the later time. Any substantive deficiencies in Framework 25 are thus not likely to be repeated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We AFFIRM the District Court's dismissal of the appellant's claims as moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Jeffrey's Ledge closure was originally scheduled to expire on May 1, 2001, three years after it was enacted as part of Framework 25, effective May 1, 1998.

This court has no means of redressing either procedural failures or substantive deficiencies associated with a regulation that is now defunct. In effect, those deficiencies have been eliminated by the promulgation of new Frameworks in compliance with the applicable procedural guidelines and based on new circumstances and data concerning the groundfish stock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GMFA argues that the provision of Framework 25 which established a year-round closure at Jeffrey's Ledge is still in effect because it has not yet expired<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and has not been modified by subsequent Frameworks. To the extent that this provision of Framework 25 is still operative, GMFA insists that we can declare it invalid. Yet, the record is clear that the Jeffrey's Ledge closure, although unmodified since enacted in Framework 25, was expressly reconsidered and re-adopted in later Frameworks. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 64 Fed.Reg. 14846 (proposed Framework 27 fishing regulations); 64 Fed.Reg. 24066 (Framework 27 as enacted). Therefore, the section of Framework 25 governing that closure is no longer in effect because fishing in Jeffrey's Ledge is now regulated by later Frameworks which, in turn, are based on later and totally different data.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since every measure introduced in Framework 25, including the Jeffrey's Ledge closure, is now governed by a later Framework, no justiciable controversy exists regarding Framework 25, and the appellant's claims are moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There remains the second question, whether appellant's claims, although moot, may still be actionable because defendant's actions are, by their nature, \"capable of repetition, yet evading review.\" <i>Weinstein v. Bradford,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109338\"><a href=\"/opinion/109338/weinstein-v-bradford/\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">147</span></a></span>, 149, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109338\"><a href=\"/opinion/109338/weinstein-v-bradford/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In order to qualify for this narrow exception to the mootness doctrine, a plaintiff must show that \"(1) the challenged action was in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration, and (2) there was a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party would be subjected to the same action again.\" <i>Id; see also Thomas R.W.,</i> 130 F.3d at 479-480 (applying the <i>Weinstein</i> test).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GMFA argues that, under the Framework system, FMPs are developed and adopted in such rapid succession that it is impossible to challenge the validity of one Framework before the next one is put into effect. The difficulty with the argument is that it is not supported by the facts. GMFA has simply not shown that \"the challenged action was in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration.\" <i>Weinstein,</i> 423 U.S. at 149, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109338\"><a href=\"/opinion/109338/weinstein-v-bradford/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span>. New fishing regulations are not promulgated so quickly under the Framework system that all timely legal challenges are inevitably precluded. The system does permit the NEFMC to adopt new fishing regulations within a matter of months; but, in practice, most Frameworks governing the Western Gulf of Maine closures (including Jeffrey's Ledge) are in place for as much as a year before being superceded by a new Framework.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At least one Framework regulation has already been fully litigated within that time frame. Framework 33, published as a final rule on April 24, 2000, has governed the closure of Jeffrey's Ledge for almost two years. One month after that Framework was enacted, a municipality affected by the closures filed a substantive legal challenge in which the appellant, GMFA, filed an amicus curiae brief. <i>City of Gloucester v. Mineta,</i> No. 00-11019REK (D.Mass. Nov. 15, 2000). The judge in that case recommended expedited review, and the litigation concluded less than six months later. Thus, in only seven months, Framework 33 underwent a fully litigated substantive legal challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Framework 25, the regulation at issue before us, was promulgated as a final rule on March 31, 1998, effective May 1, 1998, and was in force for more than a year before it was replaced by Framework 27 on May 5, 1999, affording appellant considerable time to pursue its claims. Furthermore, appellant never requested expedited review during this litigation. On the contrary, both parties sought numerous extensions of time for filing the administrative record, motions, and briefs. As a result of these delays, we cannot know whether GMFA might have obtained a judgment on its challenges to Framework 25 before the adoption of a subsequent Framework rendered those challenges moot. Given the actual, as opposed to theoretical, interval between most Frameworks and the historical fact that review is indeed possible, we decline to hold that Framework 25 was \"too short in duration\" to be fully litigated before its expiration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant fails as well to satisfy the second requirement of the <i>Weinstein</i> test. Neither the procedural nor the substantive deficiencies raised by appellant are likely to recur.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GMFA's procedural challenge to Framework 25 grew out of an admittedly insufficient notice and comment process during the promulgation of that regulation. Appellant urges that, absent some declaration by this court, the NEFMC's failure to adequately notify certain interested parties of the proposed rule, and the consequent inability of those parties to comment on the rule prior to its adoption, could easily be repeated in the adoption of future Frameworks. Yet, GMFA concedes that the NEFMC has complied with the relevant notice and comment guidelines in adopting all subsequent Frameworks, and it has pointed to no evidence in the record which suggests that the procedural failures which occurred with respect to Framework 25 will be repeated. We thus affirm the District Court's determination that GMFA's objections to procedural deficiencies in the creation of Framework 25 are moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GMFA also challenges Framework 25 on substantive grounds; namely, that the closures it mandated disproportionately impact small inshore fleets. This defect in Framework 25, it contends, will be repeated in subsequent frameworks because each builds upon the closures and fishing limits established in prior ones. Thus is GMFA subjected to the same action by the NEFMC over and over. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the later Frameworks do not depend on the provisions incorporated in Framework 25. They direct closures of different size, location and duration. These modified closures and limitations do not, therefore, constitute the \"same action\" with respect to appellants. The very purpose of the Framework system is to adjust the fishing regulations frequently so that no fleet or area bears the entire burden of the fishing limitations. GMFA represents several fleets, and those fleets have been impacted differently by each subsequent Framework. Because most of the limitations imposed by Framework 25 are not identical to the limitations imposed by later Frameworks, any mistakes in Framework 25 will not recur in the later ones.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, even the provisions of Framework 25 which remain unchanged in later Frameworks, such as the year-round closure at Jeffrey's Ledge, were re-adopted based on new, updated data concerning the groundfish stock. Thus, the later Frameworks do not subject the appellant to the same action because they involve an entirely new analysis. Assuming, <i>arguendo,</i> that the Jeffrey's Ledge closure in Framework 25 was found to be invalid as arbitrary and capricious under the strict standard set forth by the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 706 (1996), that does not mean that the same closure, as adopted in Framework 27 or any other Framework, was arbitrary and capricious based on the new data available to the NEFMC at the later time. Any substantive deficiencies in Framework 25 are thus not likely to be repeated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We AFFIRM the District Court's dismissal of the appellant's claims as moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Jeffrey's Ledge closure was originally scheduled to expire on May 1, 2001, three years after it was enacted as part of Framework 25, effective May 1, 1998. Our decision post-dates that expiration date. Given our conclusion that the provisions of Framework 25 at issue here were superceded by subsequent Frameworks, we need not consider whether the recent expiration of Framework 25 would provide an independent basis for our finding of mootness<i>See, e.g., Roe v.
