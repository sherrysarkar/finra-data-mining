Defendant-appellants appeal the final\r\norder and judgment denying the defendants' motion to dismiss. \r\nPlaintiff-appellee, Mark J. Fournier (\"Fournier\"), claims that he\r\nis entitled to monetary damages for personal injuries allegedly\r\nsustained as a result of the defendants' alleged deprivation of\r\nhis rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Fournier\r\nasserts that the defendants are liable under the Federal Civil\r\nRights Act, 42 U.S.C.  1983, and under the Massachusetts Civil\r\nRights Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12,  11I.  For the following\r\nreasons, we reverse.\r\nBACKGROUND  Fournier was employed by the Essex County Sheriff's\r\nDepartment as a corrections officer for more than ten years prior\r\nto entering a basic training academy (\"academy\") run by the Essex\r\nCounty Sheriff's Department.  On May 1, 1995, Fournier and twenty\r\nother corrections officers began attending a nine week basic\r\ntraining course which the Essex County Sheriff's Department\r\nrequired for full-time employment.  The academy was staffed by\r\nother Essex County Sheriff's Department corrections officers.  It\r\noffered both classroom and physical training such as standing at\r\nattention, instruction as to chain of command, and protocol in\r\ninteracting with superior officers.\r\nOn the second day of the course, Fournier was ordered to report\r\nto the academy training staff's office.  Protocol taught and\r\nenforced at the academy required that Fournier, an academy\r\nrecruit: (1) knock outside the instructors' office door; (2)\r\nannounce his presence; and (3) request permission to enter before\r\nentering the instructors' office.  Fournier breached academy\r\nprotocol when he failed to follow this regimented procedure and\r\nentered the office unannounced.\r\nTo punish Fournier for violating academy protocol, one of the\r\ndrill instructors present in the room ordered Fournier to turn\r\naround and bend over.  When Fournier complied, the drill\r\ninstructor placed handcuffs on his wrists and informed Fournier\r\nthat he was being placed under \"house arrest\" for entering the\r\ninstructors' office without having requested permission.  The\r\ndrill instructor then allegedly put Fournier's written reports in\r\nhis mouth and ordered him to return to the classroom.  The other\r\ndrill instructors in the room failed to intervene on Fournier's\r\nbehalf.\r\nFournier returned, in handcuffs, to the classroom.  Within five\r\nminutes of the \"house arrest,\" the drill instructor entered the\r\nclassroom.  Pursuant to academy protocol, the recruits rose to\r\nattention upon the entrance of a superior officer.  When the\r\ndrill instructor ordered the class to be seated, Fournier\r\nattempted to seat himself.  Unfortunately, Fournier missed his\r\nchair and fell to the ground, allegedly sustaining serious\r\npersonal injuries, including a fractured vertebra.\r\nDISCUSSION \r\nI.  Standard of Review\r\nAlthough most denials of motions to dismiss are not \"final\r\ndecisions,\" and thus are not independently appealable, a district\r\ncourt's rejection of a qualified immunity defense is a \"final\r\ndecision,\"  Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 528 (1985), and\r\nthus we review it here.  Because \"[a] necessary concomitant to\r\nthe determination of whether the constitutional right asserted by\r\na plaintiff is 'clearly established' at the time the defendant\r\nacted is the determination of whether the plaintiff has asserted\r\na violation of a constitutional right at all,\"  Siegert v.\r\nGilley, 500 U.S. 226, 232 (1991), we will consider whether\r\nFournier has asserted a violation of any constitutional right in\r\nhis complaint.\r\nII.  Section 1983 Claims\r\n  Section 1983 states, in relevant part:\r\n  Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance,\r\n  regulation, custom, or usage, of any State . . . subjects, or\r\n  causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States   . . .\r\n  to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities\r\n  secured by the Constitution and laws shall be liable to the party\r\n  injured in any action at law, suit in equity, or other proper\r\n  proceeding for redress.\r\n\n42 U.S.C.  1983.  \"[Section] 1983 'is not itself a source of\r\nsubstantive rights,' but merely provides 'a method for\r\nvindicating federal rights conferred.'\"  Graham v. Connor, 490\r\nU.S. 386, 393-94 (1989) (quoting Baker v. McCollan, 443 U.S. 137,\r\n144 n.3 (1979)).  \"To succeed, a section 1983 plaintiff must show\r\na violation of a right secured by federal law.\"  Skinner v. City\r\nof Miami, 62 F.3d 344, 346 (11th Cir. 1995).  \r\nFournier claims three separate constitutional violations:  (1) a\r\nviolation of his Fourth Amendment rights; (2) a violation of his\r\nright to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment; and (3) a\r\nviolation of his right to equal protection of the laws under the\r\nFourteenth Amendment.  None of his arguments is persuasive.\r\nA.  Fourth Amendment\r\nThe Fourth Amendment provides that \"[t]he right of the people to\r\nbe secure . . . against unreasonable . . . seizures, shall not be\r\nviolated.\"  U.S. Const. amend. IV.  Under the Mendenhall test,\r\nformulated by Justice Stewart in United States v. Mendenhall, 446\r\nU.S. 544, 554 (1980), and adopted by the United States Supreme\r\nCourt in later cases, see Michigan v. Chesternut, 486 U.S. 567,\r\n573 (1988):  \"[A] person has been 'seized' within the meaning of\r\nthe Fourth Amendment only if, in view of all of the circumstances\r\nsurrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed\r\nthat he was not free to leave.\"  Mendenhall, 446 U.S. at 554. \r\nFournier argues that when the drill instructor placed him under\r\n\"house arrest\" and handcuffed him behind his back, he was seized\r\nfor purposes of Fourth Amendment analysis.  We disagree. Under\r\nthe Mendenhall test, a court must look at all the circumstances\r\nsurrounding the incident to determine if a reasonable observer\r\nwould have believed that Fournier was not free to leave.\r\nAlthough Fournier was handcuffed, no evidence presented would\r\nsupport a finding that he was not free to leave at any point\r\nduring the scenario.  Fournier understood that \"house arrest\" was\r\npart of the basic training academy course.  He submitted to being\r\nhandcuffed, and then returned to the classroom.  We grant that if\r\nhe did object to being handcuffed, there could possibly have been\r\nnegative consequences for his continued employment as a\r\ncorrections officer.  However, the possible effect that refusing\r\nto be handcuffed may have had on his employment status is not an\r\nissue for us to consider.  Rather, the question is whether a\r\nviolation of Fournier's right to be free from seizure occurred. \r\nIn view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident, a\r\nreasonable observer would conclude that Fournier was the subject\r\nof improper hazing, which might give rise to a state law claim\r\nbased on tort or employment theories, but would not believe that\r\nFournier was not free to call an end to the \"house arrest\" and\r\nhave the handcuffs removed.\r\nB.   Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Claims\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment states that a \"State [shall not] deprive\r\nany person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of\r\nlaw . . . .\"  U.S. Const. amend. XIV.  Due process claims may\r\ntake either of two forms:  \"procedural due process\" or\r\n\"substantive due process.\"  Pittsley v. Warish, 927 F.2d 3, 6\r\n(1st Cir. 1991).  Procedural due process requires that the\r\nprocedures provided by the state in effecting the deprivation of\r\nlife, liberty or property are adequate in light of the affected\r\ninterest.  Id.  Substantive due process, however, imposes limits\r\non what a state may do regardless of what procedural protection\r\nis provided.  Id. (citing Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 171-72\r\n(1961); Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 169 (1952)).  In this\r\ncase, Fournier invokes the latter prong of due process\r\nprotection:  (1) by arguing that he had a constitutionally\r\nprotected liberty interest in being disciplined only as set forth\r\nin the Essex County Sheriff's Department Training Manual; and (2)\r\nby contending that the county owed him and others similarly\r\nsituated a constitutional right to safe conditions and freedom\r\nfrom bodily restraint.\r\n  1.  Disciplinary Procedure Due Process Claim\r\nIt is well established that a state actor's failure to observe a\r\nduty imposed by state law, standing alone, is not sufficient to\r\nestablish a  1983 claim.  See Martnez v. Coln, 54 F.3d 980,\r\n989 (1st Cir. 1995).  Although it is true that constitutional\r\nsignificance may attach to certain interests created by state\r\nlaw, not every transgression of state law does double duty as a\r\nconstitutional violation.  Id.  As this Court stated in Martnez:\r\n\"[T]he Constitution is not an empty ledger awaiting the entry of\r\nan aggrieved litigant's recitation of alleged state law\r\nviolations . . . .\"  Id.\r\nFournier cites Massachusetts law, see  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, \r\n40, and departmental regulations which govern the discipline of\r\nrecruits in training programs, to found his claim of a  1983\r\nviolation.  However, whether Massachusetts law was violated or\r\nthe department failed to follow its own disciplinary procedures\r\nmatters little because neither alleged deficiency establishes a \r\n1983 violation.  \r\n2.  Affirmative Obligation Due Process Claim\r\nThe substantive element of the Due Process Clause protects those\r\nrights that are fundamental, rights that are \"implicit in the\r\nconcept of ordered liberty.\"  Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319,\r\n325 (1937).  The Supreme Court has deemed that most, but not all,\r\nof the rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights are fundamental. \r\nIn addition, certain unenumerated rights, such as the right to\r\nprivacy, are deemed fundamental.\r\nWhile the Supreme Court has extended substantive due process\r\nprotection to certain unenumerated rights, it has not extended\r\nFourteenth Amendment coverage to many areas.  \"Tort law is one\r\nsuch area that remains largely outside substantive due process\r\njurisprudence.\"  Skinner, 62 F.3d at 346 (citing Daniels v.\r\nWilliams, 474 U.S. 327, 332 (1986) (noting that the Due Process\r\nClause \"does not purport to supplant traditional tort law in\r\nlaying down rules of conduct to regulate liability for injuries\r\nthat attend living together in society\")) (citations omitted).\r\nFournier contends that there is a constitutional right to safe\r\nconditions.  But see  DeShaney v. Winnebago County Department of\r\nSocial Services, 489 U.S. 189, 195, 202 (1989) (\"The Clause is\r\nphrased as a limitation on the State's power to act, not as a\r\nguarantee of certain minimal levels of safety and security . . .\r\n. A State may, through its courts and legislatures, impose such\r\naffirmative duties of care and protection upon its agents as it\r\nwishes.  But not 'all common-law duties owed by government actors\r\nwere . . . constitutionalized by the Fourteenth Amendment.'\" \r\n(quoting Daniels, 474 U.S. at 335)).  Second, Fournier claims his\r\nconstitutional right to freedom from bodily restraint was\r\nviolated when he was handcuffed.  As discussed above, Fournier's\r\n\"house arrest\" does not rise to the level of a constitutional\r\nviolation.  See supra, at 5-6.  Fournier's Complaint attempts to\r\nconflate an ordinary tort--battery--into a constitutional\r\nviolation.  Unfortunately for his cause, not everything is a\r\nfederal case.\r\n3.  Equal Protection Clause Claim\r\nIn a novel, yet utterly misguided attempt at an Equal Protection\r\nClause claim, Fournier contends: \"[The drill instructor] placed\r\nthe plaintiff under house arrest because of the plaintiff's\r\nconduct as a recruit.  It is fair to infer that . . . [the drill\r\ninstructor] would not have placed a non-recruit under house\r\narrest for similar conduct.\"  Appellee's Br. at 13.  We do not\r\nfind that such a distinction rises to the level of an Equal\r\nProtection violation.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause Fournier has not been able to show a violation of a\r\nfederal right, it is not necessary for this Court to reach the\r\ndefense of qualified immunity.  For the reasons stated in this\r\nopinion, we reverse the judgment of the district court.  Judgment\r\nis issued for the defendant-appellants.\r\n",

Plaintiff-appellee, Mark J. Fournier (\"Fournier\"), claims that he is entitled to monetary damages for personal injuries allegedly sustained as a result of the defendants' alleged deprivation of his rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Fournier asserts that the defendants are liable under the Federal Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, and under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 12, &#167; 11I.

On May 1, 1995, Fournier and twenty other corrections officers began attending a nine week basic training course which the Essex County Sheriff's Department required for full-time employment.  The academy was staffed by other Essex County Sheriff's Department corrections officers.  It offered both classroom and physical training such as standing at attention, instruction as to chain of command, and protocol in interacting with superior officers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the second day of the course, Fournier was ordered to report to the academy training staff's office.  Protocol taught and enforced at the academy required that Fournier, an academy recruit:  (1) knock outside the instructors' office door;  (2) announce his presence;  and (3) request permission to enter before entering the instructors' office.  Fournier breached academy protocol when he failed to follow this regimented procedure and entered the office unannounced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To punish Fournier for violating academy protocol, one of the drill instructors present in the room ordered Fournier to turn around and bend over.  When Fournier complied, the drill instructor placed handcuffs on his wrists and informed Fournier that he was being placed under \"house arrest\" for entering the instructors' office without having requested permission.  The drill instructor then allegedly put Fournier's written reports in his mouth and ordered him to return to the classroom.  The other drill instructors in the room failed to intervene on Fournier's behalf.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fournier returned, in handcuffs, to the classroom.  Within five minutes of the \"house arrest,\" the drill instructor entered the classroom.  Pursuant to academy protocol, the recruits rose to attention upon the entrance of a superior officer.  When the drill instructor ordered the class to be seated, Fournier attempted to seat himself.  Unfortunately, Fournier missed his chair and fell to the ground, allegedly sustaining serious personal injuries, including a fractured vertebra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>I.

We disagree.  Under the Mendenhall test, a court must look at all the circumstances surrounding the incident to determine if a reasonable observer would have believed that Fournier was not free to leave.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Fournier was handcuffed, no evidence presented would support a finding that he was not free to leave at any point during the scenario.  Fournier understood that \"house arrest\" was part of the basic training academy course.  He submitted to being handcuffed, and then returned to the classroom.  We grant that if he did object to being handcuffed, there could possibly have been negative consequences for his continued employment as a corrections officer.  However, the possible effect that refusing to be handcuffed may have had on his employment status is not an issue for us to consider.  Rather, the question is whether a violation of Fournier's right to be free from seizure occurred.  In view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable observer would conclude that Fournier was the subject of improper hazing, which might give rise to a state law claim based on tort or employment theories, but would not believe that Fournier was not free to call an end to the \"house arrest\" and have the handcuffs removed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fourteenth Amendment states that a \"State [shall not] deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law....\"  U.S. Const. amend.  XIV. Due process claims may take either of two forms:  \"procedural due process\" or \"substantive due process.\"  Pittsley v.

Procedural due process requires that the procedures provided by the state in effecting the deprivation of life, liberty or property are adequate in light of the affected interest.  Id. Substantive due process, however, imposes limits on what a state may do regardless of what procedural protection is provided.  Id. (citing Monroe v.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">183</span></span> (1952)).  In this case, Fournier invokes the latter prong of due process protection:  (1) by arguing that he had a constitutionally protected liberty interest in being disciplined only as set forth in the Essex County Sheriff's Department Training Manual;  and (2) by contending that the county owed him and others similarly situated a constitutional right to safe conditions and freedom from bodily restraint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1. Disciplinary Procedure Due Process Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well established that a state actor's failure to observe a duty imposed by state law, standing alone, is not sufficient to establish a &#167; 1983 claim.

A State may, through its courts and legislatures, impose such affirmative duties of care and protection upon its agents as it wishes.  But not 'all common-law duties owed by government actors were ... constitutionalized by the Fourteenth Amendment.' \")  (quoting Daniels, 474 U.S. at 335, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111555\"><a href=\"/opinion/111555/daniels-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

As discussed above, Fournier's \"house arrest\" does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation.  See supra, at 756-57.   Fournier's Complaint attempts to conflate an ordinary tort--battery--into a constitutional violation.  Unfortunately for his cause, not everything is a federal case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. Equal Protection Clause Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a novel, yet utterly misguided attempt at an Equal Protection Clause claim, Fournier contends:  \"[The drill instructor] placed the plaintiff under house arrest because of the plaintiff's conduct as a recruit.  It is fair to infer that ... [the drill instructor] would not have placed a non-recruit under house arrest for similar conduct.\"   Appellee's Br. at 13.  We do not find that such a distinction rises to the level of an Equal Protection violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Fournier has not been able to show a violation of a federal right, it is not necessary for this Court to reach the defense of qualified immunity.  For the reasons stated in this opinion, we reverse the judgment of the district court.  Judgment is issued for the defendant-appellants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The statue provides:</p>\n        <p>Whoever, having the direct management or direct control over the conduct of physical exercise as part of a course of study or training program at any public or private institution, agency or entity, willfully, wantonly and recklessly causes serious bodily injury to a person participating in a course of study or training program involving physical exercise, shall be punished by a fine of not more than five thousand dollars or by imprisonment in a jail or house of correction for not more than two and one-half years or both.</p>\n        <p>For the purposes of this section \"serious bodily injury\" shall mean bodily injury which creates a substantial risk of death or which involves either total disability or the loss or substantial impairment of some bodily function for a substantial period of time.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
