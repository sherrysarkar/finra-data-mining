SMITH, A/K/A JUVENILE, MALE,\r\n\n             Defendant, Appellant.\r\n\n                                  \r\n\n  APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n           FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\r\n\n    [Hon. Gene Carter, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                                  \r\n\n                     Before\r\n\n             Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n         Magill, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n           and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n                                  \r\n\nWilliam Maselli, by appointment of the Court, with whom Law\r\nOffices of William Maselli was on brief, for appellant.\r\nF. Mark Terison, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\r\nJay P. McCloskey, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\r\nappellee.\r\n\n                                  \r\n\n                  May 17,1999\r\n                                           MAGILL, Senior Circuit Judge.  Michael S. Smith was over\r\nseventeen years old on the night he and two others committed an\r\narmed carjacking and two armed robberies.  A federal criminal\r\ncomplaint was filed and, based on the United States Attorney's 18\r\nU.S.C.  5032(3) certification that a \"substantial Federal\r\ninterest\" in the case justified federal jurisdiction, the district\r\ncourt held that it had jurisdiction.  After the district court\r\ngranted the government's motion to transfer Smith for prosecution\r\nas an adult, Smith entered a conditional guilty plea.  On appeal,\r\nhe challenges both the certification that a substantial federal\r\ninterest in this case warranted federal jurisdiction and the\r\ndistrict court's decision to transfer him for adult prosecution. \r\nWe affirm and join five of our sister circuits in holding that\r\ncertification of a substantial federal interest is not reviewable.\r\n                       I.\r\nDuring the evening of February 6, 1997, Michael Smith,\r\nwho was just eight months shy of his eighteenth birthday and\r\nserving a term of probation for one of his previous four criminal\r\nconvictions, went on a crime spree with Robert Newell (Newell), an\r\nadult, and Robert W. (Robert), a juvenile.  That night, they\r\ncommitted two armed robberies and one armed carjacking.  They first\r\ndecided to rob an apartment.  After entering the apartment, Robert\r\nmenaced each of the occupants with a handgun while Smith held a\r\nbutcher knife against the throat of one of the occupants.  When\r\nmaking their getaway from the apartment, Newell, Robert, and Smith\r\ncame across a woman unloading groceries from her car.  Robert\r\ngrabbed her, pointed the gun in her face, and demanded that she\r\ngive him the car keys.  After taking the woman's car, they realized\r\nthat they needed gasoline and stopped at a gasoline station.  While\r\nRobert pumped gas, Smith entered the station, pointed the gun at\r\nthe cashier, and demanded that she give him some cigarettes.  After\r\ntaking the cigarettes and informing the cashier that they would not\r\npay for the gas, the three left the gas station.\r\nThe gas station cashier then called the police and\r\nreported the crime.  When officers spotted the stolen car, a chase\r\nensued.  Eventually, Robert lost control of the car and drove down\r\nan embankment.  Although both Robert and Smith jumped out of the\r\ncar and attempted to flee, the police quickly apprehended them.\r\nAfter Smith's arrest, a federal criminal complaint was\r\nfiled, charging him in two counts.  The first count charged Smith\r\nwith conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C.  371, to interfere with\r\ncommerce by means of robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C.  1951, and\r\nto take a motor vehicle by means of force, violence and\r\nintimidation, and with the intent to cause death or serious bodily\r\nharm, in violation of 18 U.S.C.  2119.  The second count charged\r\nhim with using and carrying a firearm in connection with the\r\nconspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C.  924(c)(1).  Pursuant to 18\r\nU.S.C.  5032(3), the United States Attorney certified that Smith\r\nwas a juvenile and that there was a \"substantial Federal interest\"\r\nin the case and the offenses to warrant the exercise of federal\r\njurisdiction.  The United States Attorney also filed a motion to\r\ntransfer Smith for prosecution as an adult.\r\nSmith filed a motion to dismiss the case for lack of\r\nfederal jurisdiction, contending that there was not a substantial\r\nfederal interest.  The district court denied the motion, finding\r\nthat the United States Attorney's certification of a substantial\r\nfederal interest was unreviewable.\r\nSmith also objected to the government's transfer motion. \r\nAfter appointing a psychologist to examine Smith and conducting a\r\nhearing, the district court granted the government's motion to\r\ntransfer.  In doing so, the court \"place[d] primary importance on\r\nthe seriousness of the crimes committed by [Smith].\"  United States\r\nv. MS-Juvenile Male, No. 97-6-P-C, slip op. at 10 (D. Me. Feb. 4,\r\n1998).\r\nSmith subsequently entered a conditional guilty plea.  On\r\nappeal, he contends that (1) the district court erred in refusing\r\nto review the United States Attorney's certification that a\r\nsubstantial federal interest exists in this case and (2) the\r\ndistrict court abused its discretion in granting the government's\r\nmotion to transfer.\r\n                      II.\r\nThis case requires this court to delve into the procedure\r\nset forth in 18 U.S.C.  5032 for trying a juvenile in federal\r\ncourt and for transferring such a juvenile for prosecution as an\r\nadult.  In relevant part,  5032 provides that a district court has\r\njurisdiction over a juvenile if \"the Attorney General, after\r\ninvestigation, certifies to the appropriate district court of the\r\nUnited States that . . . (3) the offense charged is a crime of\r\nviolence that is a felony . . . and that there is a substantial\r\nFederal interest in the case or the offense to warrant the exercise\r\nof Federal jurisdiction.\"  18 U.S.C.  5032.  Once federal\r\njurisdiction has attached, juvenile delinquency proceedings ensue\r\nunless the court transfers the juvenile for prosecution as an\r\nadult.  If the government files a motion for transfer on the ground\r\nthat the felony is a \"crime of violence,\" the court must hold a\r\nhearing, consider evidence of the six specific factors set forth in\r\n5032, and make \"findings with regard to each factor . . . in the\r\nrecord.\"  Id.  The district court then must weigh the factors and\r\ndetermine whether a \"transfer would be in the interest of justice.\" \r\nId.; see also United States v. Hemmer, 729 F.2d 10, 17-18 (1st Cir.\r\n1984).  If the court deems a transfer would be in the interest of\r\njustice, the court may transfer the juvenile for prosecution as an\r\nadult.\r\nA.  Certification\r\nSmith first contends that the district court erred in\r\nconcluding that it lacked jurisdiction to review the United States\r\nAttorney's certification made pursuant to  5032(3) that a\r\n\"substantial Federal interest\" warranted federal prosecution. \r\nAlthough this court has not yet determined whether a court has\r\njurisdiction to review a United States Attorney's certification\r\nthat there is a \"substantial Federal interest\" in a particular\r\ncase, five of the six other circuits addressing this issue have\r\nheld that a court may not review such a certification.  See United\r\nStates v. Juvenile Male J.A.J., 134 F.3d 905 (8th Cir.), cert.\r\ndenied, 118 S. Ct. 2388 (1998); In re Sealed Case, 131 F.3d 208\r\n(D.C. Cir. 1997); United States v. Juvenile No. 1, 118 F.3d 298\r\n(5th Cir.), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 457 (1997); Impounded, 117\r\nF.3d 730 (3d Cir. 1997); United States v. I.D.P., 102 F.3d 507\r\n(11th Cir. 1996).  Only the Fourth Circuit has permitted judicial\r\nreview of the existence of a substantial federal interest in a\r\n5032 certification.  See United States v. Juvenile Male #1, 86\r\nF.3d 1314 (4th Cir. 1996).  \r\nWe agree with the great majority of circuits that hold\r\nthat \"the United States Attorney's certification of a substantial\r\nfederal interest is an unreviewable act of prosecutorial\r\ndiscretion.\"  Juvenile Male J.A.J., 134 F.3d at 909.  As explained\r\nmore thoroughly by the Eighth Circuit in Juvenile Male J.A.J. and\r\nthe Third Circuit in Impounded, the statute's text and structure,\r\nas well as separation of powers concerns, support our conclusion\r\nthat a federal court may not review a United States Attorney's\r\ncertification of a substantial federal interest.  See Juvenile\r\nMale J.A.J., 134 F.3d at 906-09; Impounded, 117 F.3d at 733-37. \r\nThe text of  5032 does not specifically provide for\r\njudicial review of a certification and fails to articulate any\r\nstandards for determining the existence of a substantial federal\r\ninterest.  Conversely,  5032 \"expressly provides for judicial\r\nreview of orders transferring a juvenile for adult prosecution and\r\noutlines standards for courts to apply, yet it is silent regarding\r\nreview of certification.\"  In re Sealed Case, 131 F.3d at 212. \r\nLike the Eighth Circuit, we believe that \"Congress's decision to\r\nspecifically allow judicial review of transfer, but not of\r\ncertification of a substantial federal interest, is powerful\r\nevidence that judicial review of the latter is barred.\"  Juvenile\r\nMale J.A.J., 134 F.3d at 908; see also Juvenile No. 1, 118 F.3d at\r\n305 (\"We find it difficult to conclude that Congress intended to\r\nleave the courts to their own devices in determining whether a\r\n'substantial Federal interest' exists 'to warrant the exercise of\r\nFederal jurisdiction,' while specifying with such care the\r\nconsiderations that must inform a court's evaluation of whether a\r\ntransfer would be 'in the interest of justice' in a particular\r\ncase.\").  In addition, we note that \"the exercise of prosecutorial\r\ndiscretion, at the very core of the executive function, has long\r\nbeen held presumptively unreviewable.\"  In re Sealed Case, 131 F.3d\r\nat 214; see also Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598, 607 (1985)\r\n(noting that \"the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what\r\ncharge to file or bring before a grand jury, generally rests\r\nentirely in [the prosecutor's] discretion\" and \"[t]his broad\r\ndiscretion rests largely on the recognition that the decision to\r\nprosecute is particularly ill-suited to judicial review\" (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted)).  \"In the context of certification under\r\nthis statute, the government's authority to ascertain the presence\r\nof a substantial federal interest is no different from its\r\nauthority to decide whether to prosecute a case in a federal forum. \r\nThis type of decision falls squarely within the parameters of\r\nprosecutorial discretion that [is unreviewable].\"  I.D.P., 102 F.3d\r\nat 511; see also Juvenile No. 1, 118 F.3d at 306 (agreeing that\r\n\"the government's authority to certify that a given case implicates\r\na substantial federal interest is akin to the government's\r\nauthority to decide which cases to prosecute\" (internal quotation\r\nmarks omitted)).  Furthermore, we agree with the Fifth Circuit that\r\nthe \"legislative history . . . also indicates congressional intent\r\nto vest the federal prosecutor, not the court, with authority to\r\ndecide whether a substantial federal interest exists in a\r\nparticular case.\"  Id.; see generally id. at 306-07 (analyzing\r\nlegislative history); I.D.P., 102 F.3d at 512-13 (same).\r\nBased on the foregoing, we conclude that United States\r\nAttorney's certification of a substantial federal interest\r\nconstitutes an unreviewable act of prosecutorial discretion. \r\nAccordingly, we affirm the district court's refusal to review the\r\nUnited States Attorney's certification that a \"substantial Federal\r\ninterest\" warrants prosecuting Smith in federal court.  Because\r\nSmith raises no other challenges to the certification, we find\r\nthat the district court properly exercised jurisdiction over Smith.         B.  Transfer\r\nSmith next contends that the district court erred in\r\nconcluding that transferring him for prosecution as an adult \"would\r\nbe in the interest of justice.\"  18 U.S.C.  5032.  We disagree.\r\nSo long as the district court makes findings as to the\r\nsix criteria outlined in  5032, we review the district court's\r\ninterest-of-justice determination for an abuse of discretion.  See\r\nHemmer, 729 F.2d at 17-18.  The district court's findings of fact\r\nunderlying the transfer decision are reviewed under the clearly\r\nerroneous standard.  See, e.g., United States v. Parker, 956 F.2d\r\n169, 171 (8th Cir. 1992); Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a).\r\nSmith has undertaken a difficult burden in challenging\r\nthe transfer.  \"[N]o court of appeals has ever found that a\r\ndistrict court abused its discretion by failing to balance properly\r\nthe six statutory factors.\"  United States v. Juvenile Male # 1, 47\r\nF.3d 68, 71 (2d Cir. 1995) (citing cases).  This includes every\r\npublished case where \"the juvenile was transferred to adult status\r\nfor the crime of armed robbery,\" United States v. Doe, 871 F.2d\r\n1248, 1252 (5th Cir. 1989) (citing cases from three other\r\ncircuits), or for the crime of armed carjacking, see United States \r\nv. Wellington, 102 F.3d 499, 506 (11th Cir. 1996); United States v.\r\nA.R., 38 F.3d 699, 705 (3d Cir. 1994). \r\nAs required by  5032, the district court considered and\r\nmade written findings as to each of the following six factors:  (1)\r\n\"the age and social background of the juvenile;\" (2) \"the nature of\r\nthe alleged offense;\" (3) \"the extent and nature of the juvenile's\r\nprior delinquency record;\" (4) \"the juvenile's present intellectual\r\ndevelopment and psychological maturity;\" (5) \"the nature of past\r\ntreatment efforts and the juvenile's response to such efforts;\" and\r\n(6) \"the availability of programs designed to treat the juvenile's\r\nbehavioral problems.\"  18 U.S.C.  5032.  The district court found\r\nthat (1) Smith joined a gang at age fourteen, fathered a child at\r\nage fifteen, and committed the instant offenses at the age of\r\nseventeen years and four months; (2) the instant offenses--two\r\narmed robberies and one armed carjacking--\"undoubtedly qualif[y]\r\namong the most serious and violent acts this Court is presented\r\nwith each day,\" slip op. at 9-10; (3) Smith's previous criminal\r\nrecord included four convictions over the course of five years and\r\nseven additional criminal charges which had been dismissed; (4)\r\nSmith's psychological maturity is somewhere between adolescence and\r\nadulthood, and Smith has a broad range of psychological and\r\nbehavioral problems which reflect a Borderline Personality Disorder\r\nand are complicated by Smith's history of alcohol and drug abuse;\r\n(5) treating Smith as a juvenile in the past had proved to be\r\nineffectual (not only did Smith have an extensive criminal record,\r\nbut he was serving a term of probation at the time he committed the\r\ninstant offenses); and (6) it could not be sure that the federal\r\njuvenile system had sufficient treatment programs available for\r\nSmith.  On the basis of its findings, and relying primarily on the\r\negregiousness of the instant offenses, the court concluded that\r\ntransferring Smith for adult prosecution would be in the interest\r\nof justice.\r\nHaving carefully reviewed the record, we conclude that\r\nthe district court's findings as to each factor are not clearly\r\nerroneous.  Although Smith challenges the manner in which the\r\ndistrict court weighed the various factors, we have previously\r\nexplained that \"it is within the district court's reasoned\r\ndiscretion as to what weight to assign each factor.\"  Hemmer, 729\r\nF.2d at 17; see also Wellington, 102 F.3d at 506 (explaining that\r\na district court is \"not required to weigh all statutory factors\r\nequally\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Courts have\r\nunanimously held that a district court does not abuse its\r\ndiscretion in placing primary emphasis on the gravity of the\r\njuvenile's offense.  See Hemmer, 729 F.2d at 18 (\"In light of the\r\ngravity of the crime involved [(armed robbery)], weighed against\r\nthe other five section 5032 factors, we cannot say that the\r\ndistrict court struck the balance improperly.\"); see also Juvenile\r\nNo. 1, 118 F.3d at 307 (explaining that \"[t]he seriousness of the\r\noffense, for instance, can be given more weight than other factors\"\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted)); Wellington, 102 F.3d at 506\r\n(holding that \"a district court is entitled to give more weight to\r\nthe seriousness of the offense than to other factors\"); A.R., 38\r\nF.3d at 705 (holding that the district court did not err by placing\r\nstrong reliance on juvenile's crime--armed carjacking); Doe, 871\r\nF.2d at 1255 (also holding that the district court did not err in\r\nplacing strong emphasis on juvenile's crime--armed robbery). \r\nMoreover, the proximity of a juvenile's age to age eighteen is\r\nanother important factor for the court's consideration.  See\r\nWellington, 102 F.3d at 506-07 &amp; n.7.  Smith was only eight months\r\nshy of eighteen at the time he committed these three armed criminal\r\noffenses.  In view of the gravity of the instant offenses, Smith's\r\nage when he committed those offenses, and Smith's extensive\r\ncriminal record, we find that the district court did not abuse its\r\ndiscretion in concluding that transferring Smith for adult\r\nprosecution would be in the interest of justice.\r\n                      III.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court.\n",

Michael S. Smith was over\r\nseventeen years old on the night he and two others committed an\r\narmed carjacking and two armed robberies.  A federal criminal\r\ncomplaint was filed and, based on the United States Attorney's 18\r\nU.S.C.  5032(3) certification that a \"substantial Federal\r\ninterest\" in the case justified federal jurisdiction, the district\r\ncourt held that it had jurisdiction.  After the district court\r\ngranted the government's motion to transfer Smith for prosecution\r\nas an adult, Smith entered a conditional guilty plea.  On appeal,\r\nhe challenges both the certification that a substantial federal\r\ninterest in this case warranted federal jurisdiction and the\r\ndistrict court's decision to transfer him for adult prosecution. \r\nWe affirm and join five of our sister circuits in holding that\r\ncertification of a substantial federal interest is not reviewable.\r\n                       I.\r\nDuring the evening of February 6, 1997, Michael Smith,\r\nwho was just eight months shy of his eighteenth birthday and\r\nserving a term of probation for one of his previous four criminal\r\nconvictions, went on a crime spree with Robert Newell (Newell), an\r\nadult, and Robert W.

The first count charged Smith\r\nwith conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C.  371, to interfere with\r\ncommerce by means of robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C.  1951, and\r\nto take a motor vehicle by means of force, violence and\r\nintimidation, and with the intent to cause death or serious bodily\r\nharm, in violation of 18 U.S.C.  2119.

Pursuant to 18\r\nU.S.C.  5032(3), the United States Attorney certified that Smith\r\nwas a juvenile and that there was a \"substantial Federal interest\"\r\nin the case and the offenses to warrant the exercise of federal\r\njurisdiction.

On\r\nappeal, he contends that (1) the district court erred in refusing\r\nto review the United States Attorney's certification that a\r\nsubstantial federal interest exists in this case and (2) the\r\ndistrict court abused its discretion in granting the government's\r\nmotion to transfer.\r\n                      II.\r\nThis case requires this court to delve into the procedure\r\nset forth in 18 U.S.C.  5032 for trying a juvenile in federal\r\ncourt and for transferring such a juvenile for prosecution as an\r\nadult.  In relevant part,  5032 provides that a district court has\r\njurisdiction over a juvenile if \"the Attorney General, after\r\ninvestigation, certifies to the appropriate district court of the\r\nUnited States that . . . (3) the offense charged is a crime of\r\nviolence that is a felony . . . and that there is a substantial\r\nFederal interest in the case or the offense to warrant the exercise\r\nof Federal jurisdiction.\"  18 U.S.C.  5032.  Once federal\r\njurisdiction has attached, juvenile delinquency proceedings ensue\r\nunless the court transfers the juvenile for prosecution as an\r\nadult.  If the government files a motion for transfer on the ground\r\nthat the felony is a \"crime of violence,\" the court must hold a\r\nhearing, consider evidence of the six specific factors set forth in\r\n5032, and make \"findings with regard to each factor . . . in the\r\nrecord.\"  Id.  The district court then must weigh the factors and\r\ndetermine whether a \"transfer would be in the interest of justice.\" \r\nId.; see also United States v. Hemmer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"431992\"><a href=\"/opinion/431992/united-states-v-james-hemmer-united-states-of-america-v-john-cusick/\"><span class=\"volume\">729</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17-18 (1st Cir.\r\n1984).  If the court deems a transfer would be in the interest of\r\njustice, the court may transfer the juvenile for prosecution as an\r\nadult.\r\nA.  Certification\r\nSmith first contends that the district court erred in\r\nconcluding that it lacked jurisdiction to review the United States\r\nAttorney's certification made pursuant to  5032(3) that a\r\n\"substantial Federal interest\" warranted federal prosecution. \r\nAlthough this court has not yet determined whether a court has\r\njurisdiction to review a United States Attorney's certification\r\nthat there is a \"substantial Federal interest\" in a particular\r\ncase, five of the six other circuits addressing this issue have\r\nheld that a court may not review such a certification.

Only the Fourth Circuit has permitted judicial\r\nreview of the existence of a substantial federal interest in a\r\n5032 certification.  See United States v. Juvenile Male #1, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"720531\"><a href=\"/opinion/720531/united-states-v-juvenile-male-1/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1314</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. 1996).  \r\nWe agree with the great majority of circuits that hold\r\nthat \"the United States Attorney's certification of a substantial\r\nfederal interest is an unreviewable act of prosecutorial\r\ndiscretion.\"  Juvenile Male J.A.J., 134 F.3d at 909.  As explained\r\nmore thoroughly by the Eighth Circuit in Juvenile Male J.A.J. and\r\nthe Third Circuit in Impounded, the statute's text and structure,\r\nas well as separation of powers concerns, support our conclusion\r\nthat a federal court may not review a United States Attorney's\r\ncertification of a substantial federal interest.  See Juvenile\r\nMale J.A.J., 134 F.3d at 906-09; Impounded, 117 F.3d at 733-37. \r\nThe text of  5032 does not specifically provide for\r\njudicial review of a certification and fails to articulate any\r\nstandards for determining the existence of a substantial federal\r\ninterest.  Conversely,  5032 \"expressly provides for judicial\r\nreview of orders transferring a juvenile for adult prosecution and\r\noutlines standards for courts to apply, yet it is silent regarding\r\nreview of certification.\"  In re Sealed Case, 131 F.3d at 212. \r\nLike the Eighth Circuit, we believe that \"Congress's decision to\r\nspecifically allow judicial review of transfer, but not of\r\ncertification of a substantial federal interest, is powerful\r\nevidence that judicial review of the latter is barred.\"  Juvenile\r\nMale J.A.J., 134 F.3d at 908; see also Juvenile No. 1, 118 F.3d at\r\n305 (\"We find it difficult to conclude that Congress intended to\r\nleave the courts to their own devices in determining whether a\r\n'substantial Federal interest' exists 'to warrant the exercise of\r\nFederal jurisdiction,' while specifying with such care the\r\nconsiderations that must inform a court's evaluation of whether a\r\ntransfer would be 'in the interest of justice' in a particular\r\ncase.\").  In addition, we note that \"the exercise of prosecutorial\r\ndiscretion, at the very core of the executive function, has long\r\nbeen held presumptively unreviewable.\"  In re Sealed Case, 131 F.3d\r\nat 214; see also Wayte v.

Furthermore, we agree with the Fifth Circuit that\r\nthe \"legislative history . . . also indicates congressional intent\r\nto vest the federal prosecutor, not the court, with authority to\r\ndecide whether a substantial federal interest exists in a\r\nparticular case.\"  Id.; see generally id. at 306-07 (analyzing\r\nlegislative history); I.D.P., 102 F.3d at 512-13 (same).\r\nBased on the foregoing, we conclude that United States\r\nAttorney's certification of a substantial federal interest\r\nconstitutes an unreviewable act of prosecutorial discretion. \r\nAccordingly, we affirm the district court's refusal to review the\r\nUnited States Attorney's certification that a \"substantial Federal\r\ninterest\" warrants prosecuting Smith in federal court.  Because\r\nSmith raises no other challenges to the certification, we find\r\nthat the district court properly exercised jurisdiction over Smith.         B.  Transfer\r\nSmith next contends that the district court erred in\r\nconcluding that transferring him for prosecution as an adult \"would\r\nbe in the interest of justice.\"  18 U.S.C.  5032.  We disagree.\r\nSo long as the district court makes findings as to the\r\nsix criteria outlined in  5032, we review the district court's\r\ninterest-of-justice determination for an abuse of discretion.  See\r\nHemmer, 729 F.2d at 17-18.  The district court's findings of fact\r\nunderlying the transfer decision are reviewed under the clearly\r\nerroneous standard.  See, e.g., United States v.

The district court found\r\nthat (1) Smith joined a gang at age fourteen, fathered a child at\r\nage fifteen, and committed the instant offenses at the age of\r\nseventeen years and four months; (2) the instant offenses--two\r\narmed robberies and one armed carjacking--\"undoubtedly qualif[y]\r\namong the most serious and violent acts this Court is presented\r\nwith each day,\" slip op. at 9-10; (3) Smith's previous criminal\r\nrecord included four convictions over the course of five years and\r\nseven additional criminal charges which had been dismissed; (4)\r\nSmith's psychological maturity is somewhere between adolescence and\r\nadulthood, and Smith has a broad range of psychological and\r\nbehavioral problems which reflect a Borderline Personality Disorder\r\nand are complicated by Smith's history of alcohol and drug abuse;\r\n(5) treating Smith as a juvenile in the past had proved to be\r\nineffectual (not only did Smith have an extensive criminal record,\r\nbut he was serving a term of probation at the time he committed the\r\ninstant offenses); and (6) it could not be sure that the federal\r\njuvenile system had sufficient treatment programs available for\r\nSmith.  On the basis of its findings, and relying primarily on the\r\negregiousness of the instant offenses, the court concluded that\r\ntransferring Smith for adult prosecution would be in the interest\r\nof justice.\r\nHaving carefully reviewed the record, we conclude that\r\nthe district court's findings as to each factor are not clearly\r\nerroneous.  Although Smith challenges the manner in which the\r\ndistrict court weighed the various factors, we have previously\r\nexplained that \"it is within the district court's reasoned\r\ndiscretion as to what weight to assign each factor.\"  Hemmer, 729\r\nF.2d at 17; see also Wellington, 102 F.3d at 506 (explaining that\r\na district court is \"not required to weigh all statutory factors\r\nequally\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Courts have\r\nunanimously held that a district court does not abuse its\r\ndiscretion in placing primary emphasis on the gravity of the\r\njuvenile's offense.  See Hemmer, 729 F.2d at 18 (\"In light of the\r\ngravity of the crime involved [(armed robbery)], weighed against\r\nthe other five section 5032 factors, we cannot say that the\r\ndistrict court struck the balance improperly.\"); see also Juvenile\r\nNo. 1, 118 F.3d at 307 (explaining that \"[t]he seriousness of the\r\noffense, for instance, can be given more weight than other factors\"\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted)); Wellington, 102 F.3d at 506\r\n(holding that \"a district court is entitled to give more weight to\r\nthe seriousness of the offense than to other factors\"); A.R., 38\r\nF.3d at 705 (holding that the district court did not err by placing\r\nstrong reliance on juvenile's crime--armed carjacking); Doe, 871\r\nF.2d at 1255 (also holding that the district court did not err in\r\nplacing strong emphasis on juvenile's crime--armed robbery). \r\nMoreover, the proximity of a juvenile's age to age eighteen is\r\nanother important factor for the court's consideration.  See\r\nWellington, 102 F.3d at 506-07 &amp; n.7.  Smith was only eight months\r\nshy of eighteen at the time he committed these three armed criminal\r\noffenses.  In view of the gravity of the instant offenses, Smith's\r\nage when he committed those offenses, and Smith's extensive\r\ncriminal record, we find that the district court did not abuse its\r\ndiscretion in concluding that transferring Smith for adult\r\nprosecution would be in the interest of justice.\r\n                      III.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court.\n</pre>",
