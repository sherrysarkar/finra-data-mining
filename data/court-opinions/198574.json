This appeal requires us\r\nto address whether a prosecutor's various errors and acts of\r\nmisconduct throughout the course of a criminal trial require\r\nreversal.  Although we find fault with a number of the prosecutor's\r\ntactics in this case, we conclude that none of these errors\r\nsupports reversal under the applicable standards of review. \r\nAccordingly, we affirm.\r\n                          BACKGROUND\r\nEnrique \"Rickie\" Auch stood trial for armed bank robbery\r\nin violation of 18 U.S.C.  2113(a), robbery affecting commerce in\r\nviolation of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C.  1951(a), and carrying a\r\nfirearm during and in relation to a crime of violence in violation\r\nof 18 U.S.C.  924(c).  The evidence at trial showed that Auch had\r\nparticipated in the robbery of an armored car delivering money to\r\nthe Fleet National Bank in Charlestown, Massachusetts (the\r\n\"Charlestown robbery\").  James Tracy, another participant in the\r\nCharlestown robbery, cooperated with the government and testified\r\nagainst Auch at trial.  Tracy testified that Auch had stolen cars\r\nto help facilitate the robbery and that, when one of the other\r\nmembers of the group that had planned the robbery could not\r\nparticipate, Auch agreed to replace him as the driver.  Tracy also\r\ntestified that he gave Auch an unloaded .357 revolver as the group\r\nprepared to rob the armored car.  Tracy testified regarding the\r\nevents of the robbery, which lasted no more than 30 seconds and\r\nnetted $350,000.\r\nSteven Connolly also testified against Auch as a\r\ngovernment  witness.  Connolly had not participated in the\r\nCharlestown robbery, but he agreed to permit the government to tape\r\na conversation between himself and Auch during which Auch bragged\r\nabout his participation.  The government introduced a recording of\r\nthe inculpatory conversation and a transcript of the relevant\r\nportions at Auch's trial.  During trial, Auch's counsel questioned\r\nthe credibility of both Tracy and Connolly, suggesting that the\r\nwitnesses had an incentive to lie about Auch's involvement in the\r\nCharlestown robbery to receive more favorable treatment from the\r\ngovernment on the various charges they faced.\r\nIn the government's opening statement, the prosecutor\r\ntold the jury that they would hear testimony from Auch's friends,\r\ni.e., the people with whom Auch had chosen to associate and work. \r\nThen, during the government's direct examinations of Tracy and\r\nConnolly, the prosecutor repeatedly referred to a separate crime in\r\nHudson, New Hampshire, involving the murder of two persons during\r\nthe robbery of an armored car (the \"Hudson robbery\").  Tracy\r\nadmitted to having participated in that robbery, and the prosecutor\r\nasked Connolly why the FBI had interviewed his girlfriend about the\r\nHudson robbery.  Despite Auch's repeated objections, which the\r\ndistrict court sustained, the prosecutor continued to ask questions\r\nconcerning the Hudson robbery and referred to the crime again\r\nduring closing argument.\r\nDuring closing and rebuttal arguments, the prosecutor\r\nmade a further series of questionable and troubling remarks. \r\nFirst, the prosecutor made various assertions in support of the\r\ncredibility of the government's witnesses.  The prosecutor asserted\r\nthat Tracy had no motive to lie, that Tracy knew that if he lied\r\n\"his life is done,\" and that Tracy had told the truth about Auch\r\nand his own crimes, \"like the honest man that he has been in this\r\ncourt.\"  The prosecutor suggested that if Tracy had wanted to curry\r\nfavor with the government by testifying falsely against Auch that\r\nhe would have fabricated a stronger story against him.  Finally,\r\nthe prosecutor urged the members of the jury to convict Auch\r\nbecause if they failed to do so Auch \"would . . . laugh[] all the\r\nway to the bank.\"\r\n                          DISCUSSION\r\nI.  References to Matters Not in Evidence\r\nAuch's first and most serious ground for appeal concerns\r\nthe prosecutor's repeated references to a separate crime--the\r\nHudson robbery--during the presentation of the government's\r\nevidence.  Auch argues that the references to this independent\r\ncrime, in combination with the prosecutor's earlier statement that\r\nAuch was friends with government witnesses, implicated Auch in the\r\nviolent and well-publicized Hudson robbery and unfairly prejudiced\r\nthe jury against him.\r\nBefore we turn to the merits of Auch's argument, we must\r\ndecide the standard of review.  The government argues that we\r\nshould review Auch's claims for plain error because Auch failed to\r\nobject with specificity to the prosecutor's references to the\r\nHudson robbery at trial, while Auch argues that his objections were\r\nsufficient to avoid plain error review.  In United States v.\r\nCarrillo-Figueroa, 34 F.3d 33 (1st Cir. 1994), we explained that\r\n\"[u]nless the basis for objection is apparent from the context, the\r\ngrounds for objection must be specific so that the trial court may\r\nhave an opportunity to address the claim later sought to be\r\npresented on appeal.\"  Id. at 39.  A review of the trial transcript\r\nreveals that Auch repeatedly objected to the prosecutor's questions\r\nregarding the Hudson robbery but never proffered specific grounds\r\nfor his objections.  Nevertheless, given the context of the issues\r\nat stake during the trial and the complete irrelevance of the\r\nHudson robbery to the case against Auch, we conclude that the\r\ngrounds for Auch's objections were clear.  It is significant that\r\nthe district court felt no need to inquire as to the grounds for\r\nAuch's objections before immediately sustaining them.\r\nThe government, however, argues that Auch's objections to\r\nthe prosecutor's irrelevant questions cannot preserve the present\r\ngrounds for appeal--namely, prosecutorial misconduct.  See United\r\nStates v. Montas, 41 F.3d 775, 782-83 (1st Cir. 1994) (applying\r\nplain error review when the grounds for the defendant's objections\r\nvaried from the issue on appeal).  We cannot agree.  The prosecutor\r\nin this case continued to make improper references to the Hudson\r\nrobbery despite the district court's repeated decisions sustaining\r\nAuch's continued objections.  Here the relevant exchanges\r\nsufficiently alerted both the government and the district court to\r\nthe prosecutor's apparently willful misconduct in ignoring the\r\ntrial court's evidentiary rulings so as to preserve the issue of\r\nprosecutorial misconduct for appeal.  See Carrillo-Figueroa, 34\r\nF.3d at 39 (noting that context can make the grounds for objection\r\nobvious); cf. United States v. Wilson, 149 F.3d 1298, 1301 &amp; n.5\r\n(11th Cir. 1998) (permitting full appellate review of defendant's\r\nallegations of prosecutorial misconduct despite defendant's failure\r\nto object to each relevant remark).  Accordingly, we afford Auch's\r\narguments on this issue full appellate review and will not apply\r\nthe plain error rule.\r\nWe turn now to the merits of Auch's argument that the\r\nprosecutor's repeated references to the Hudson robbery warrant the\r\nreversal of his convictions.  The law is clear that a prosecutor's\r\nreliance (or apparent reliance) upon matters not in evidence is\r\nimproper.  See United States v. Tajeddini, 996 F.2d 1278, 1284 (1st\r\nCir. 1993).  We do not consider the challenged comments in\r\nisolation but within the broader context.  See United States v.\r\nSeplveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1187 (1st Cir. 1993).  In assessing a\r\ndefendant's allegation of prosecutorial misconduct we consider (1)\r\nwhether the prosecutor's misconduct was isolated and/or deliberate;\r\n(2) whether the trial court gave a strong and explicit cautionary\r\ninstruction; and (3) whether any prejudice surviving the court's\r\ninstruction likely could have affected the outcome of the case. \r\nSee United States v. Hodge-Balwing, 952 F.2d 607, 610 (1st Cir.\r\n1991) (citing United States v. Capone, 683 F.2d 582, 586-87 (1st\r\nCir. 1982)).  In this case, the prosecutor's continued references\r\nto the Hudson robbery over Auch's repeated and sustained\r\nobjections compel the conclusion that the prosecutor's comments\r\nwere part of a deliberate pattern.  The record also demonstrates\r\nthat the district court sustained Auch's objections to the\r\nprosecutor's questions regarding the Hudson robbery and instructed\r\nthe prosecutor, in front of the jury, to stick to the case at hand.\r\nFinally, and most importantly, however, we cannot say\r\nthat the prosecutor's misguided tactic in this case could have\r\naffected the outcome of the trial.  The evidence the government\r\nadduced against Auch at trial overwhelmingly demonstrated his guilt\r\non the charges at hand.  Tracy testified at length and in detail\r\nregarding Auch's participation in the robbery, and the government\r\nbolstered his testimony with corroborating evidence.  Particularly\r\ndamning to Auch's case was the government's introduction of Auch's\r\ntape-recorded statements, made to Connolly, boasting about his\r\nparticipation as the \"wheelman\" in the Charlestown robbery.  In the\r\nface of such evidence regarding Auch's participation in the\r\nCharlestown robbery we cannot say that the prosecutor's conduct,\r\nimproper though it was, \"so poisoned the well\" to require reversal. \r\nHodge-Balwing, 952 F.2d at 610 (internal quotation omitted).\r\nII.  Auch's Remaining Contentions\r\nAt oral argument, Auch conceded that he failed to\r\npreserve the remaining issues for appeal by making contemporaneous\r\nobjections at trial.  Absent such objections, we review a\r\ndefendant's claims for plain error.  See United States v. Olano,\r\n507 U.S. 725, 732-37, 113 S. Ct. 1770, 1776-79 (1993) (describing\r\nthe plain error standard); United States v. Wihbey, 75 F.3d 761,\r\n770 &amp; n.4 (1st Cir. 1996).  We will not reverse a conviction on\r\nplain error review unless the error affects the substantial rights\r\nof the defendant.  See Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b).  We cannot find that\r\nan error has affected the defendant's substantial rights unless it\r\nis clear that the error affected the outcome of the proceedings. \r\nSee Olano, 507 U.S. at 734, 113 S. Ct. at 1777-78.  Given our\r\nconclusion above that the government's evidence against Auch was\r\noverwhelming and even the prosecutor's serious error could not have\r\naffected the outcome of the trial, Auch's remaining allegations of\r\nerror do not merit reversal under our more limited plain error\r\nreview.  Nevertheless, to the extent Auch has raised issues of\r\nsubstance, we will catalog and discuss his claims to reemphasize\r\nour teachings on these issues and to deter future prosecutorial\r\nmisconduct.  See generally United States v. Hasting, 461 U.S. 499,\r\n506-07, 103 S. Ct. 1974, 1979 (1983) (prosecutorial misconduct that\r\ndoes not affect the defendant's substantial rights may not permit\r\nthe guilty to go free simply to deter future misconduct).\r\nA.  Prosecutorial Vouching\r\nA prosecutor may not place \"the prestige of the\r\ngovernment behind a witness by making personal assurances about the\r\nwitness'[s] credibility;\" nor may the prosecutor indicate that\r\nfacts outside the jury's cognizance support the testimony of the\r\ngovernment's witnesses.  United States v. Neal, 36 F.3d 1190, 1207\r\n(1st Cir. 1994).  Auch argues that the prosecutor engaged in\r\nseveral instances of improper vouching during his closing argument,\r\nparticularly with reference to Tracy, the government's primary\r\nwitness.\r\nFirst, Auch correctly points out that the prosecutor\r\nimproperly injected his personal opinion of the evidence into his\r\nclosing argument.  See United States v. Smith, 982 F.2d 681, 684 &amp;\r\nn.2 (1st Cir. 1993) (prosecutor's use of \"I think\" during closing\r\nargument was improper).  The prosecutor in this case told the jury\r\nthat \"[t]he only way I can even imagine ever acquitting this man of\r\nany of the charges is if you totally disbelieve Mr. Tracy as to\r\neverything he said about Mr. Auch.\"  Although the prosecutor did\r\nnot use the prohibited \"I think,\" language, the statement\r\nnonetheless conveyed a personal opinion to the jury and, therefore,\r\nwas improper.\r\nSecond, Auch argues that the prosecutor's statements that\r\nTracy had told the truth, that he had acted like an honest man, and\r\nthat Tracy's life would be over if he had lied during the trial,\r\nconstituted further illegal vouching.  To the extent that the\r\nprosecutor's arguments referred to Tracy's motives to tell the\r\ntruth, the argument falls within the accepted bounds and was\r\nentirely proper.  See United States v. Dockray, 943 F.2d 152, 156\r\n(1st Cir. 1991); United States v. Martin, 815 F.2d 818, 821-23 (1st\r\nCir. 1987).  The prosecutor's introduction of Tracy's plea\r\nagreement and his commentary on the dire consequences Tracy would\r\nface if he committed perjury during Auch's trial, therefore, do not\r\nconstitute improper vouching.\r\nBeyond that, however, many of the prosecutor's remarks\r\nmay have crossed the line.  The government concedes that the\r\nprosecutor's repeated statements to the effect that Tracy had acted\r\nlike an honest man and had testified truthfully at least entered a\r\ngray area of impropriety.  See United States v. Innamorati, 996\r\nF.2d 456, 483 (1st Cir. 1993) (noting a \"hazy\" line between\r\nlegitimate argument and improper vouching).  Although some of the\r\nchallenged statements fall into this gray area, assertions to the\r\neffect that Tracy had told the truth run afoul of the long-standing\r\ndecisions of this court.  See Wihbey, 75 F.3d at 772 (prosecutor's\r\ncomment that government witness testified truthfully was improper);\r\nUnited States v. Meja-Lozano, 829 F.2d 268, 273 (1st Cir. 1987)\r\n(same).  We acknowledge that Auch's strategy at trial was to\r\ncharacterize Tracy and Connolly as witnesses who had lied to curry\r\nfavor with the government and that the prosecutor's remarks came in\r\nresponse to defense counsel's attempts to portray the government's\r\nwitnesses in the worst light.  See Meja-Lozano, 829 F.2d at 274\r\n(giving the prosecutor \"greater leeway\" when improper vouching came\r\n\"in response to defense counsel's inflammatory statements\"). \r\nNevertheless, \"a trespass by the defense [does not] give[] the\r\nprosecution a hunting license exempt from ethical restraints on\r\nadvocacy.\"  Capone, 683 F.2d at 586 (quoting Patriarca v. United\r\nStates, 402 F.2d 314, 321 (1st Cir. 1968)).\r\nFinally, Auch challenges the prosecutor's comments to the\r\neffect that if Tracy was willing to lie about Auch's involvement in\r\nthe robbery to curry favor with the government, he would have\r\nconcocted a more damaging story.  We found this type of comment\r\nto be beyond the bounds of proper argument in United States v.\r\nManning, 23 F.3d 570 (1st Cir. 1994).  In that case, the prosecutor\r\nsaid that if the government's witness really wanted to lie, there\r\nwere \"a million little ways they could have given it to the\r\nDefendant\" but argued that the government's witnesses could not lie\r\nor exaggerate because they were bound by their oaths and the truth.\r\nId. at 572.  We held that this improper vouching, in combination\r\nwith a number of additional prosecutorial missteps during closing\r\narguments, required reversal.  Id. at 575.  We acknowledge that\r\nManning is distinguishable because the relatively sparse evidence\r\nof the defendant's guilt on the charges at issue in Manning led us\r\nto question whether the prosecutor's misconduct had swayed the\r\njury.  Nevertheless, we find the comments at issue in this case\r\nindistinguishable from those in Manning in their impropriety, and\r\nprosecutors in this circuit should consider themselves well advised\r\nto strike such commentary from their repertoires.\r\nB. Extra-Judicial Consequences of the Verdict\r\nA prosecutor must refrain from attempting to deflect the\r\njury's attention from the narrow issue of the defendant's guilt or\r\ninnocence; any attempt to \"foist onto the jury responsibility for\r\nthe extra-judicial consequences of a not-guilty verdict\" is\r\nimproper.  United States v. Whiting, 28 F.3d 1296, 1302 (1st Cir.\r\n1994).  Auch contends that the prosecutor committed such a\r\ntransgression by arguing that a not guilty verdict would result in\r\nthe biggest day of Auch's life and that he would laugh all the way\r\nto the bank.\r\nThe government candidly admits that the prosecutor did\r\nnot choose his words carefully in this portion of the closing\r\nargument.  We find the prosecutor's lack of discretion particularly\r\ntroubling in this instance because the comments came towards the\r\nend of the government's rebuttal and, as the last words that the\r\njury heard from the trial attorneys, had great potential to cause\r\nprejudice.  See Manning, 23 F.3d at 575 (emphasizing the\r\nsignificance of the timing of improper remarks to the jury).\r\nNevertheless, the prosecutor's ill-advised rhetoric or\r\npained attempt at humor appears to have been relatively harmless in\r\nthis instance.  The majority of our cases that address a\r\nprosecutor's references to the extra-judicial consequences of a\r\njury's verdict involve more sweeping arguments.  Typical examples\r\ninclude a prosecutor's attempt to enlist the jurors in the war on\r\ndrugs, see Arrieta-Agressot v. United States, 3 F.3d 525, 527 (1st\r\nCir. 1993) (\"[T]he defendants are not soldiers in the army of good. \r\nThey are soldiers in the army of evil, in the army which only\r\npurpose [sic] is to poison, to disrupt, to corrupt.\"), or a demand\r\nthat the jury prevent the defendant from harming other victims, see\r\nWhiting, 28 F.3d at 1302 (\"exhort[ing] . . .  the jurors not to\r\n'let other kids be succored [sic] in by [the defendant's] flash,\r\nthat cash, that deception'\").  In this case, the prosecutor's\r\nremarks were confined to how Auch would react if the jury rendered\r\na verdict of not guilty.  Although the remarks may have been\r\ncalculated to \"excite the jury, invite a partisan response, and\r\ndistract its attention from the only issue properly presented by\r\nthis case: whether the evidence established [Auch's] guilt beyond\r\na reasonable doubt,\" Arrieta-Agressot, 3 F.3d at 529-30, the\r\nprosecutor's remarks were not as far afield as those requiring\r\nreversal under the plain error standard.\r\n                          CONCLUSION\r\nAlthough we find the prosecutor's various transgressions\r\nand missteps in the conduct of this trial both disturbing and\r\nexasperating, we discern no reversible error.  The evidence of\r\nAuch's guilt on the charges is plain in the record and leads us to\r\nconclude that none of the errors described above--whether\r\nconsidered in isolation or in combination--could have had any\r\nmeaningful effect on the jury's ultimate verdict.  Accordingly, we\r\nheed the Supreme Court's admonition against letting the guilty go\r\nfree to punish prosecutorial misconduct.  See United States v.\r\nHasting, 461 U.S. 499, 506-07, 103 S. Ct. 1974, 1979 (1983).\r\nProsecutors, however, also would do well to heed the Supreme\r\nCourt's warnings that our recourse is not limited to public hand-\r\nwringing in the pages of the federal reporters.  In the appropriate\r\ncase, the courts will not hesitate to refer an offending prosecutor\r\nto the Department of Justice for further investigation and\r\ndiscipline.  Id. at 506 n.5, 103 S. Ct. at 1979 n.5. (describing\r\nthis and other options the courts may exercise in the face of a\r\nprosecutor's unethical conduct).\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM.\r\n",

The evidence at trial showed that Auch had\r\nparticipated in the robbery of an armored car delivering money to\r\nthe Fleet National Bank in Charlestown, Massachusetts (the\r\n\"Charlestown robbery\").  James Tracy, another participant in the\r\nCharlestown robbery, cooperated with the government and testified\r\nagainst Auch at trial.  Tracy testified that Auch had stolen cars\r\nto help facilitate the robbery and that, when one of the other\r\nmembers of the group that had planned the robbery could not\r\nparticipate, Auch agreed to replace him as the driver.  Tracy also\r\ntestified that he gave Auch an unloaded .357 revolver as the group\r\nprepared to rob the armored car.  Tracy testified regarding the\r\nevents of the robbery, which lasted no more than 30 seconds and\r\nnetted $350,000.\r\nSteven Connolly also testified against Auch as a\r\ngovernment  witness.  Connolly had not participated in the\r\nCharlestown robbery, but he agreed to permit the government to tape\r\na conversation between himself and Auch during which Auch bragged\r\nabout his participation.  The government introduced a recording of\r\nthe inculpatory conversation and a transcript of the relevant\r\nportions at Auch's trial.  During trial, Auch's counsel questioned\r\nthe credibility of both Tracy and Connolly, suggesting that the\r\nwitnesses had an incentive to lie about Auch's involvement in the\r\nCharlestown robbery to receive more favorable treatment from the\r\ngovernment on the various charges they faced.\r\nIn the government's opening statement, the prosecutor\r\ntold the jury that they would hear testimony from Auch's friends,\r\ni.e., the people with whom Auch had chosen to associate and work. \r\nThen, during the government's direct examinations of Tracy and\r\nConnolly, the prosecutor repeatedly referred to a separate crime in\r\nHudson, New Hampshire, involving the murder of two persons during\r\nthe robbery of an armored car (the \"Hudson robbery\").  Tracy\r\nadmitted to having participated in that robbery, and the prosecutor\r\nasked Connolly why the FBI had interviewed his girlfriend about the\r\nHudson robbery.  Despite Auch's repeated objections, which the\r\ndistrict court sustained, the prosecutor continued to ask questions\r\nconcerning the Hudson robbery and referred to the crime again\r\nduring closing argument.\r\nDuring closing and rebuttal arguments, the prosecutor\r\nmade a further series of questionable and troubling remarks. \r\nFirst, the prosecutor made various assertions in support of the\r\ncredibility of the government's witnesses.  The prosecutor asserted\r\nthat Tracy had no motive to lie, that Tracy knew that if he lied\r\n\"his life is done,\" and that Tracy had told the truth about Auch\r\nand his own crimes, \"like the honest man that he has been in this\r\ncourt.\"  The prosecutor suggested that if Tracy had wanted to curry\r\nfavor with the government by testifying falsely against Auch that\r\nhe would have fabricated a stronger story against him.  Finally,\r\nthe prosecutor urged the members of the jury to convict Auch\r\nbecause if they failed to do so Auch \"would . . . laugh[] all the\r\nway to the bank.\"\r\n                          DISCUSSION\r\nI.  References to Matters Not in Evidence\r\nAuch's first and most serious ground for appeal concerns\r\nthe prosecutor's repeated references to a separate crime--the\r\nHudson robbery--during the presentation of the government's\r\nevidence.  Auch argues that the references to this independent\r\ncrime, in combination with the prosecutor's earlier statement that\r\nAuch was friends with government witnesses, implicated Auch in the\r\nviolent and well-publicized Hudson robbery and unfairly prejudiced\r\nthe jury against him.\r\nBefore we turn to the merits of Auch's argument, we must\r\ndecide the standard of review.  The government argues that we\r\nshould review Auch's claims for plain error because Auch failed to\r\nobject with specificity to the prosecutor's references to the\r\nHudson robbery at trial, while Auch argues that his objections were\r\nsufficient to avoid plain error review.  In United States v.\r\nCarrillo-Figueroa, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195598\"><a href=\"/opinion/195598/united-states-v-carrillo-figueroa/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1994), we explained that\r\n\"[u]nless the basis for objection is apparent from the context, the\r\ngrounds for objection must be specific so that the trial court may\r\nhave an opportunity to address the claim later sought to be\r\npresented on appeal.\"  Id. at 39.  A review of the trial transcript\r\nreveals that Auch repeatedly objected to the prosecutor's questions\r\nregarding the Hudson robbery but never proffered specific grounds\r\nfor his objections.  Nevertheless, given the context of the issues\r\nat stake during the trial and the complete irrelevance of the\r\nHudson robbery to the case against Auch, we conclude that the\r\ngrounds for Auch's objections were clear.  It is significant that\r\nthe district court felt no need to inquire as to the grounds for\r\nAuch's objections before immediately sustaining them.\r\nThe government, however, argues that Auch's objections to\r\nthe prosecutor's irrelevant questions cannot preserve the present\r\ngrounds for appeal--namely, prosecutorial misconduct.  See United\r\nStates v. Montas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195767\"><a href=\"/opinion/195767/united-states-v-felix-montas/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">775</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 782-83 (1st Cir. 1994) (applying\r\nplain error review when the grounds for the defendant's objections\r\nvaried from the issue on appeal).  We cannot agree.  The prosecutor\r\nin this case continued to make improper references to the Hudson\r\nrobbery despite the district court's repeated decisions sustaining\r\nAuch's continued objections.  Here the relevant exchanges\r\nsufficiently alerted both the government and the district court to\r\nthe prosecutor's apparently willful misconduct in ignoring the\r\ntrial court's evidentiary rulings so as to preserve the issue of\r\nprosecutorial misconduct for appeal.  See Carrillo-Figueroa, 34\r\nF.3d at 39 (noting that context can make the grounds for objection\r\nobvious); cf. United States v. Wilson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"73114\"><a href=\"/opinion/73114/united-states-v-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1298</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1301 &amp; n.5\r\n(11th Cir. 1998) (permitting full appellate review of defendant's\r\nallegations of prosecutorial misconduct despite defendant's failure\r\nto object to each relevant remark).  Accordingly, we afford Auch's\r\narguments on this issue full appellate review and will not apply\r\nthe plain error rule.\r\nWe turn now to the merits of Auch's argument that the\r\nprosecutor's repeated references to the Hudson robbery warrant the\r\nreversal of his convictions.  The law is clear that a prosecutor's\r\nreliance (or apparent reliance) upon matters not in evidence is\r\nimproper.  See United States v. Tajeddini, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610547\"><a href=\"/opinion/610547/united-states-v-hojatollah-tajeddini/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1278</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1284 (1st\r\nCir. 1993).  We do not consider the challenged comments in\r\nisolation but within the broader context.  See United States v.\r\nSeplveda, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662432\"><a href=\"/opinion/662432/united-states-v-david-sepulveda-united-states-of-america-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1187 (1st Cir. 1993).  In assessing a\r\ndefendant's allegation of prosecutorial misconduct we consider (1)\r\nwhether the prosecutor's misconduct was isolated and/or deliberate;\r\n(2) whether the trial court gave a strong and explicit cautionary\r\ninstruction; and (3) whether any prejudice surviving the court's\r\ninstruction likely could have affected the outcome of the case. \r\nSee United States v. Hodge-Balwing, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"574885\"><a href=\"/opinion/574885/united-states-v-saver-hodge-balwing-aka-balwin-hodge/\"><span class=\"volume\">952</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 610 (1st Cir.\r\n1991) (citing United States v. Capone, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"406407\"><a href=\"/opinion/406407/united-states-v-joseph-capone-united-states-of-america-v-richard-murnane/\"><span class=\"volume\">683</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">582</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 586-87 (1st\r\nCir. 1982)).  In this case, the prosecutor's continued references\r\nto the Hudson robbery over Auch's repeated and sustained\r\nobjections compel the conclusion that the prosecutor's comments\r\nwere part of a deliberate pattern.  The record also demonstrates\r\nthat the district court sustained Auch's objections to the\r\nprosecutor's questions regarding the Hudson robbery and instructed\r\nthe prosecutor, in front of the jury, to stick to the case at hand.\r\nFinally, and most importantly, however, we cannot say\r\nthat the prosecutor's misguided tactic in this case could have\r\naffected the outcome of the trial.  The evidence the government\r\nadduced against Auch at trial overwhelmingly demonstrated his guilt\r\non the charges at hand.  Tracy testified at length and in detail\r\nregarding Auch's participation in the robbery, and the government\r\nbolstered his testimony with corroborating evidence.  Particularly\r\ndamning to Auch's case was the government's introduction of Auch's\r\ntape-recorded statements, made to Connolly, boasting about his\r\nparticipation as the \"wheelman\" in the Charlestown robbery.  In the\r\nface of such evidence regarding Auch's participation in the\r\nCharlestown robbery we cannot say that the prosecutor's conduct,\r\nimproper though it was, \"so poisoned the well\" to require reversal. \r\nHodge-Balwing, 952 F.2d at 610 (internal quotation omitted).\r\nII.  Auch's Remaining Contentions\r\nAt oral argument, Auch conceded that he failed to\r\npreserve the remaining issues for appeal by making contemporaneous\r\nobjections at trial.  Absent such objections, we review a\r\ndefendant's claims for plain error.  See United States v. Olano,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 732-37, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1770</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1776-79 (1993) (describing\r\nthe plain error standard); United States v. Wihbey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196557\"><a href=\"/opinion/196557/united-states-v-wihbey/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">761</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n770 &amp; n.4 (1st Cir. 1996).  We will not reverse a conviction on\r\nplain error review unless the error affects the substantial rights\r\nof the defendant.  See Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b).  We cannot find that\r\nan error has affected the defendant's substantial rights unless it\r\nis clear that the error affected the outcome of the proceedings. \r\nSee Olano, 507 U.S. at 734, 113 S. Ct. at 1777-78.  Given our\r\nconclusion above that the government's evidence against Auch was\r\noverwhelming and even the prosecutor's serious error could not have\r\naffected the outcome of the trial, Auch's remaining allegations of\r\nerror do not merit reversal under our more limited plain error\r\nreview.  Nevertheless, to the extent Auch has raised issues of\r\nsubstance, we will catalog and discuss his claims to reemphasize\r\nour teachings on these issues and to deter future prosecutorial\r\nmisconduct.  See generally United States v. Hasting, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110933\"><a href=\"/opinion/110933/united-states-v-hasting/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n506-07, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110933\"><a href=\"/opinion/110933/united-states-v-hasting/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Prosecutorial Vouching\r\nA prosecutor may not place \"the prestige of the\r\ngovernment behind a witness by making personal assurances about the\r\nwitness'[s] credibility;\" nor may the prosecutor indicate that\r\nfacts outside the jury's cognizance support the testimony of the\r\ngovernment's witnesses.  United States v. Neal, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"679500\"><a href=\"/opinion/679500/united-states-v-gary-p-neal-united-states-v-william-f-kenney-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1190</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1207\r\n(1st Cir. 1994).  Auch argues that the prosecutor engaged in\r\nseveral instances of improper vouching during his closing argument,\r\nparticularly with reference to Tracy, the government's primary\r\nwitness.\r\nFirst, Auch correctly points out that the prosecutor\r\nimproperly injected his personal opinion of the evidence into his\r\nclosing argument.  See United States v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597416\"><a href=\"/opinion/597416/united-states-v-joseph-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">681</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 684 &amp;\r\nn.2 (1st Cir. 1993) (prosecutor's use of \"I think\" during closing\r\nargument was improper).  The prosecutor in this case told the jury\r\nthat \"[t]he only way I can even imagine ever acquitting this man of\r\nany of the charges is if you totally disbelieve Mr. Tracy as to\r\neverything he said about Mr. Auch.\"  Although the prosecutor did\r\nnot use the prohibited \"I think,\" language, the statement\r\nnonetheless conveyed a personal opinion to the jury and, therefore,\r\nwas improper.\r\nSecond, Auch argues that the prosecutor's statements that\r\nTracy had told the truth, that he had acted like an honest man, and\r\nthat Tracy's life would be over if he had lied during the trial,\r\nconstituted further illegal vouching.  To the extent that the\r\nprosecutor's arguments referred to Tracy's motives to tell the\r\ntruth, the argument falls within the accepted bounds and was\r\nentirely proper.  See United States v. Dockray, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567594\"><a href=\"/opinion/567594/united-states-v-edward-e-dockray/\"><span class=\"volume\">943</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">152</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 156\r\n(1st Cir. 1991); United States v. Martin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"486369\"><a href=\"/opinion/486369/united-states-v-william-martin-united-states-of-america-v-james-rekrut/\"><span class=\"volume\">815</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">818</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 821-23 (1st\r\nCir. 1987).  The prosecutor's introduction of Tracy's plea\r\nagreement and his commentary on the dire consequences Tracy would\r\nface if he committed perjury during Auch's trial, therefore, do not\r\nconstitute improper vouching.\r\nBeyond that, however, many of the prosecutor's remarks\r\nmay have crossed the line.  The government concedes that the\r\nprosecutor's repeated statements to the effect that Tracy had acted\r\nlike an honest man and had testified truthfully at least entered a\r\ngray area of impropriety.  See United States v. Innamorati, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609734\"><a href=\"/opinion/609734/united-states-v-kenneth-innamorati-united-states-v-william-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">456</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 483 (1st Cir. 1993) (noting a \"hazy\" line between\r\nlegitimate argument and improper vouching).  Although some of the\r\nchallenged statements fall into this gray area, assertions to the\r\neffect that Tracy had told the truth run afoul of the long-standing\r\ndecisions of this court.  See Wihbey, 75 F.3d at 772 (prosecutor's\r\ncomment that government witness testified truthfully was improper);\r\nUnited States v. Meja-Lozano, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"494593\"><a href=\"/opinion/494593/united-states-v-martha-mejia-lozano/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">268</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 273 (1st Cir. 1987)\r\n(same).  We acknowledge that Auch's strategy at trial was to\r\ncharacterize Tracy and Connolly as witnesses who had lied to curry\r\nfavor with the government and that the prosecutor's remarks came in\r\nresponse to defense counsel's attempts to portray the government's\r\nwitnesses in the worst light.  See Meja-Lozano, 829 F.2d at 274\r\n(giving the prosecutor \"greater leeway\" when improper vouching came\r\n\"in response to defense counsel's inflammatory statements\"). \r\nNevertheless, \"a trespass by the defense [does not] give[] the\r\nprosecution a hunting license exempt from ethical restraints on\r\nadvocacy.\"  Capone, 683 F.2d at 586 (quoting Patriarca v. United\r\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 321 (1st Cir. 1968)).\r\nFinally, Auch challenges the prosecutor's comments to the\r\neffect that if Tracy was willing to lie about Auch's involvement in\r\nthe robbery to curry favor with the government, he would have\r\nconcocted a more damaging story.  We found this type of comment\r\nto be beyond the bounds of proper argument in United States v.\r\nManning, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195356\"><a href=\"/opinion/195356/united-states-v-manning/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">570</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1994).  In that case, the prosecutor\r\nsaid that if the government's witness really wanted to lie, there\r\nwere \"a million little ways they could have given it to the\r\nDefendant\" but argued that the government's witnesses could not lie\r\nor exaggerate because they were bound by their oaths and the truth.\r\nId. at 572.  We held that this improper vouching, in combination\r\nwith a number of additional prosecutorial missteps during closing\r\narguments, required reversal.  Id. at 575.  We acknowledge that\r\nManning is distinguishable because the relatively sparse evidence\r\nof the defendant's guilt on the charges at issue in Manning led us\r\nto question whether the prosecutor's misconduct had swayed the\r\njury.  Nevertheless, we find the comments at issue in this case\r\nindistinguishable from those in Manning in their impropriety, and\r\nprosecutors in this circuit should consider themselves well advised\r\nto strike such commentary from their repertoires.\r\nB. Extra-Judicial Consequences of the Verdict\r\nA prosecutor must refrain from attempting to deflect the\r\njury's attention from the narrow issue of the defendant's guilt or\r\ninnocence; any attempt to \"foist onto the jury responsibility for\r\nthe extra-judicial consequences of a not-guilty verdict\" is\r\nimproper.  United States v. Whiting, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"673817\"><a href=\"/opinion/673817/united-states-v-darryl-whiting-aka-g-god-rah-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1296</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1302 (1st Cir.\r\n1994).  Auch contends that the prosecutor committed such a\r\ntransgression by arguing that a not guilty verdict would result in\r\nthe biggest day of Auch's life and that he would laugh all the way\r\nto the bank.\r\nThe government candidly admits that the prosecutor did\r\nnot choose his words carefully in this portion of the closing\r\nargument.  We find the prosecutor's lack of discretion particularly\r\ntroubling in this instance because the comments came towards the\r\nend of the government's rebuttal and, as the last words that the\r\njury heard from the trial attorneys, had great potential to cause\r\nprejudice.  See Manning, 23 F.3d at 575 (emphasizing the\r\nsignificance of the timing of improper remarks to the jury).\r\nNevertheless, the prosecutor's ill-advised rhetoric or\r\npained attempt at humor appears to have been relatively harmless in\r\nthis instance.  The majority of our cases that address a\r\nprosecutor's references to the extra-judicial consequences of a\r\njury's verdict involve more sweeping arguments.  Typical examples\r\ninclude a prosecutor's attempt to enlist the jurors in the war on\r\ndrugs, see Arrieta-Agressot v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"628961\"><a href=\"/opinion/628961/juan-arrieta-agressot-regulo-rios-jose-antonio-barroso-adalberto/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">525</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 527 (1st\r\nCir. 1993) (\"[T]he defendants are not soldiers in the army of good. \r\nThey are soldiers in the army of evil, in the army which only\r\npurpose [sic] is to poison, to disrupt, to corrupt.\"), or a demand\r\nthat the jury prevent the defendant from harming other victims, see\r\nWhiting, 28 F.3d at 1302 (\"exhort[ing] . . .  the jurors not to\r\n'let other kids be succored [sic] in by [the defendant's] flash,\r\nthat cash, that deception'\").  In this case, the prosecutor's\r\nremarks were confined to how Auch would react if the jury rendered\r\na verdict of not guilty.  Although the remarks may have been\r\ncalculated to \"excite the jury, invite a partisan response, and\r\ndistract its attention from the only issue properly presented by\r\nthis case: whether the evidence established [Auch's] guilt beyond\r\na reasonable doubt,\" Arrieta-Agressot, 3 F.3d at 529-30, the\r\nprosecutor's remarks were not as far afield as those requiring\r\nreversal under the plain error standard.\r\n                          CONCLUSION\r\nAlthough we find the prosecutor's various transgressions\r\nand missteps in the conduct of this trial both disturbing and\r\nexasperating, we discern no reversible error.  The evidence of\r\nAuch's guilt on the charges is plain in the record and leads us to\r\nconclude that none of the errors described above--whether\r\nconsidered in isolation or in combination--could have had any\r\nmeaningful effect on the jury's ultimate verdict.  Accordingly, we\r\nheed the Supreme Court's admonition against letting the guilty go\r\nfree to punish prosecutorial misconduct.  See United States v.\r\nHasting, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110933\"><a href=\"/opinion/110933/united-states-v-hasting/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 506-07, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110933\"><a href=\"/opinion/110933/united-states-v-hasting/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
