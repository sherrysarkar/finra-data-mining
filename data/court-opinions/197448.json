D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                                          \r\n\n                             Before\r\n\n                      Stahl, Circuit Judge,\r\n                  Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                    and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n                                          \r\n\n  John R. Lemieux for appellants.\r\n  Peter J.  Brann,  Assistant Attorney  General,  with whom  Andrew\r\nKetterer, Attorney  General, and Thomas D.  Warren, Assistant Attorney\r\nGeneral, were on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                                          \r\n\n                          July 7, 1997\r\n                                          \r\r\n\n            STAHL, Circuit  Judge.   This case  requires us  to\r\n\n  determine  whether  the   Eleventh  Amendment,  as   recently\r\n\n  interpreted \r                       by the Supreme Court in Seminole Tribe v. Florida,\r\n\n  116 S. Ct. 1114 (1996), bars a federal suit for overtime  pay\r\n\n  under the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\") brought by  state\r\n\n  employees against  the State of  Maine.   The district  court\r\n\n  concluded \r                     that \r                         Seminole \r                                  Tribe was a bar and dismissed the suit.\r\n\n  For the reasons that  follow, we affirm that ruling and  thus\r\n\n  find unconstitutional a  grant of federal court  jurisdiction\r\n\n  contained in a provision of 29 U.S.C. S 216(b).  We also deny\r\n\n  a \r             motion \r                    made \r                        on \r                           appeal \r                                  by plaintiffs-appellants to amend their\r\n\n  complaint.  \r\n\n                Background and Prior Proceedings \r\n\n            In this  case, filed in  federal district court  in\r\n\n  December 1992, ninety-six  current and  former probation  and\r\n\n  parole \r                  officers (plaintiffs-appellants) have asserted that the\r\n\n  State  of Maine  improperly failed  to pay  them overtime  in\r\n\n  accordance with the requirements imposed by Section 7 of  the\r\n\n  FLSA, \r                 as \r                    codified \r                            at \r                               29 \r                                  U.S.C. S 207.  Maine contended that the\r\n\n  probation  officers were  exempt  from  the  FLSA's  overtime\r\n\n  provisions.  The district court concluded that the plaintiffs\r\n\n  were covered  employees but  came within  the FLSA's  partial\r\n\n  exemption  for  law  enforcement  officers,  thus   requiring\r\n\n  additional proceedings on the scope of Maine's liability  and\r\n\n  the damages  recoverable by the  probation officers, if  any.\r\n\n                               -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\n  Following \r                     the \r                        district \r                                 court's ruling, the state brought itself\r\n\n  into \r                compliance \r                           with \r                               the \r                                   FLSA's wage and hour requirements, but\r\n\n  because \r                   the \r                      litigants \r                                disputed how much overtime back pay Maine\r\n\n  owed the probation officers, the district court submitted the\r\n\n  plaintiffs' claims and time sheets to a special master.   See\r\n\n  Mills\r                 \r                 v. \r                    Main\r                        e, 853 F. Supp. 551, 552 (D. Me. 1994) (ruling on\r\n\n  \"issues \r                   affecting \r                            what \r                                 damages the State must pay the probation\r\n\n  officers\"); Mills  v. Maine,  839 F.  Supp. 3  (D. Me.  1993)\r\n\n  (finding liability).\r\n\n            The \r                         proceedings on liability and damages had not yet\r\n\n  concluded when  the  Supreme  Court issued  its  decision  in\r\n\n  Seminole Tribe v. Florida, 116 S. Ct. 1114 (1996).   Seminole\r\n\n  Tribe held that Congress cannot exercise its Article I powers\r\n\n  to abrogate the states' Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit\r\n\n  in  federal court,  see id.  at 1131-32,  and thus  overruled\r\n\n  Pennsylvania\r                        \r                       v. \r                          Union \r                                Gas Co., 491 U.S. 1 (1989).  On the basis\r\n\n  of \r              the \r                  holding \r                         in \r                            Seminol\r                                   e Tribe, Maine filed a motion with the\r\n\n  district court asking that the case be dismissed for lack  of\r\n\n  subject matter jurisdiction.  The district court granted  the\r\n\n  motion  and dismissed the  case pursuant to  Fed. R. Civ.  P.\r\n\n  12(b)(1).  See Mills v. Maine, No. 92-410-P-H, 1996 WL 400510\r\n\n  (D. \r               Me. \r                   July \r                        3, \r                          1996). \r                                  \r                                  In so doing, the district court refused\r\n\n  the probation officers' request  that the court either  allow\r\n\n  them \r                to \r                   conduct discovery on whether Maine waived its Eleventh\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n  Amendment immunity or,  alternatively, transfer  the case  to\r\n\n  state court.  This appeal ensued.\r\n\n                       Standard of Review\r\n\n            We review de novo a district court's dismissal  for\r\n\n  lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1).  See\r\n\n  Murphy v. United States,  45 F.3d 520, 522 (1st Cir.),  cert.\r\n\n  denied, 115 S. Ct. 2581 (1995).\r\n\n         Seminole Tribe and Eleventh Amendment Immunity\r\n\n            To determine  whether  Congress has  abrogated  the\r\n\n  states' \r                   Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in federal court\r\n\n  in \r              enacting \r                       the FLSA amendments at issue in this case, we must\r\n\n  examine   two  issues:      \"first,  whether   Congress   has\r\n\n  'unequivocally  expresse[d]  its   intent  to  abrogate   the\r\n\n  immunity,' \r                      and second, whether Congress has acted 'pursuant to\r\n\n  a valid exercise of power.'\"   Seminole Tribe, 116 S. Ct.  at\r\n\n  1123 \r                (internal \r                         citation \r                                  omitted) (quoting Green v. Mansour, 474\r\n\n  U.S. 64, 68 (1985)). \r\n\n  A.  Intent to Abrogate\r\n\n            A centerpiece of the New Deal, Congress enacted the\r\n\n  Fair \r                Labor \r                      Standards Act in 1938.  The constitutional validity\r\n\n  of the Act's minimum  wage, maximum hour, and  record-keeping\r\n\n  requirements, in addition  to its  prohibition of  interstate\r\n\n  shipment \r                    of \r                      proscribed \r                                 goods, was challenged under the Commerce\r\n\n  Clause \r                  as \r                     well as the Fifth and Tenth Amendments.  A unanimous\r\n\n  Supreme Court upheld the Act  in 1941.  See United States  v.\r\n\n                               -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n  Darby, 312  U.S. 100  (1941).   While the  original 1938  Act\r\n\n  specifically excluded states and their political subdivisions\r\n\n  from its aegis, Congress amended the FLSA in 1961 and 1966 to\r\n\n  extend coverage  to  some  state workers  employed  in  state\r\n\n  schools, hospitals, and nursing homes.  These amendments were\r\n\n  challenged under the Tenth  Amendment, but the Supreme  Court\r\n\n  ruled in 1968 that the amendments were legitimate expressions\r\n\n  of Congress' Commerce Clause powers.  See Maryland v.  Wirtz,\r\n\n  392 U.S. 183, 198-99 (1968).\r\n\n            In 1973, however, the Supreme Court concluded  that\r\n\n  the  FLSA did not  subject states to  suits brought by  state\r\n\n  employees in federal court because Congress had not indicated\r\n\n  with sufficient  clarity an  intent to  abrogate the  states'\r\n\n  Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity.  See Employees of  the\r\n\n  Dep't of Pub. Health &amp; Welfare v. Department of Pub. Health &amp;\r\n\n  Welfare\r                  , \r                    411 \r                       U.S. \r                            279, \r                                 285 (1973).  The Court noted that it had\r\n\n  scrutinized the statute's  text and legislative history,  but\r\n\n  \"ha[d] \r                  found \r                        not \r                           a \r                             word \r                                  . . . to indicate a purpose of Congress\r\n\n  to make it  possible for a citizen  of that State or  another\r\n\n  State to sue the State in the federal courts.\"  Id. \r\n\n            In 1974,  in the wake  of the  Court's decision  in\r\n\n  Employees\r                    , \r                      Congress amended the FLSA to cover almost all state\r\n\n  employees  and to  express its  intent to  subject states  to\r\n\n  private suits  brought in federal  court.   Two years  later,\r\n\n  however, in 1976, the Supreme Court overruled Wirtz, and held\r\n\n                               -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n  that \r                Congress \r                         did \r                            not \r                                have the power to extend FLSA protections\r\n\n  to  state employees  in  \"areas of  traditional  governmental\r\n\n  functions.\" \r                        \r                        National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U.S. 833,\r\n\n  855 \r               (1976) \r                     (5-4 \r                          decision).  In 1985, however, the Supreme Court\r\n\n  reversed \r                    itself yet again and overruled Usery in Garcia v. San\r\n\n  Antonio  Metro.  Transit Auth.,  469  U.S.  528  (1985)  (5-4\r\n\n  decision). \r                       \r                       \"The \r                           result \r                                  of Garcia was to bring all employees of\r\n\n  the states and their  political subdivisions within the  full\r\n\n  coverage of the FLSA.\"  Gilbreath v. Cutter Biological, Inc.,\r\n\n  931 F.2d 1320, 1324 (9th Cir. 1991).\r\n\n            There can  be little doubt  that the  FLSA, in  its\r\n\n  current \r                   form, \r                        makes \r                              clear Congress' intention to abrogate state\r\n\n  immunity from suit in federal court in private FLSA  actions.\r\n\n  The Act, as amended, defines \"Employer\" as \"any person acting\r\n\n  directly  or indirectly  in the  interest of  an employer  in\r\n\n  relation to  an employee and includes  a public agency.\"   29\r\n\n  U.S.C. S 203(d).  In relevant part, it further provides that,\r\n\n  \"In \r               the \r                   case \r                       of \r                          an \r                             individual employed by a public agency, such\r\n\n  term \r                means \r                      . \r                        . . any individual employed by a State, political\r\n\n  subdivision \r                       of a State, or an interstate governmental agency.\"\r\n\n  29 U.S.C.  S 203(e)(2),(C).   Finally, the  Act, as  amended,\r\n\n  provides in pertinent  part that, \"An  action to recover  the\r\n\n  liability  prescribed .  . .  may be  maintained against  any\r\n\n  employer (including a public agency) in any Federal or  State\r\n\n                               -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n  court \r                 of \r                    competent jurisdiction by any one or more employees.\"\r\n\n  29 U.S.C.

This\r\n\n  word of  warning  suggests  that \"a  court  should  carefully\r\n\n  consider the propriety and effect of concluding that Congress\r\n\n  has acted pursuant to S 5.\"  Timmer, 104 F.3d at 840.\r\n\n            In \r                        this \r                             case, \r                                  the \r                                      litigants do not dispute that there\r\n\n  is no congressional  statement in the  FLSA or the  statute's\r\n\n  legislative \r                       history \r                              of \r                                 any recourse to section five, Fourteenth\r\n\n  Amendment powers.   Indeed,  the State  of Maine  essentially\r\n\n  contends that because  Congress invoked  its Commerce  Clause\r\n\n  powers \r                  in \r                     passing \r                            the \r                                FLSA and the amendments pertinent to this\r\n\n  dispute, \r                    the \r                        statute cannot be justified under section five of\r\n\n  the \r               Fourteenth Amendment or any constitutional provision other\r\n\n  than  the Commerce  Clause.    Even  considering  Pennhurst's\r\n\n  'proceed \r                    with caution' rule, the problem with this argument is\r\n\n                              -10-\r                                         10\r\r\n\n  that it is  contrary to binding  Supreme Court precedent  and\r\n\n  prior decisions of this circuit and is not logical.

But . . . .\r\n          [l]et the end be legitimate, let it be within\r\n          the scope of the constitution, and all  means\r\n          which  are  appropriate,  which  are  plainly\r\n\n                              -12-\r                                         12\r\r\n\n          adapted \r                           to \r                              that end, which are not prohibited,\r\n          but consist with the letter and spirit of the\r\n          constitution, are constitutional.\r\n\n17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 421 (1819).\r\n\n            The Supreme Court  has specifically  turned to  Chief\r\n\nJustice \r                 Marshall's \r                           exposition in discussing the reach and limits of\r\n\ncongressional \r                       power \r                            under section five of the Fourteenth Amendment,\r\n\nand has concluded that congressional power under this enforcement\r\n\nprovision  \"ha[s] th[e]  same broad  scope\" as  that sketched  in\r\n\nMcCulloch.  Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641, 650 (1966).   The\r\n\noperative Fourteenth Amendment test is indeed little more than  a\r\n\nparaphrasing of Chief Justice Marshall's formulation.  See id. at\r\n\n650-51;  Ex   parte  Virginia,  100   U.S.  339,  345-46   (1879)\r\n\n(interpreting scope of congressional power under the  enforcement\r\n\nclauses \r                 of \r                    the Reconstruction Amendments).  In Morgan, the Supreme\r\n\nCourt articulated a  three-pronged test  for determining  whether\r\n\ncongressional legislation is  enacted to  enforce the  Fourteenth\r\n\nAmendment's  Equal Protection  Clause.   Specifically, the  Court\r\n\ndetermined  that  a   congressional  enactment  is   \"appropriate\r\n\nlegislation\" under section five for Equal Protection purposes  in\r\n\nthe following circumstances:   (1) if it  \"may be regarded as  an\r\n\nenactment to enforce the Equal Protection Clause,\" (2) if it  \"is\r\n\n'plainly \r                  adapted \r                          to \r                            that \r                                 end,'\" and (3) if it \"is not prohibited by\r\n\nbut  is   consistent  with  'the   letter  and   spirit  of   the\r\n\n                              -13-\r                                         13\r\r\n\nconstitution.'\"                                             ,  1\r\n\nU.S. at 421).2\r\n\n            The Sixth Circuit has concluded that the three \r                           Morgan,  384 U.S. at 651 (quoting McCulloch    7\r                                                                     Morgan\r\n\nfactors effectively reworked the longstanding constitutional test\r\n\nwe \r            have \r                 outlined above by requiring something more than a rational\r\n\nrelationship  between a  congressional  enactment  and  the  ends\r\n\ncomprehended by the Fourteenth  Amendment.  See Wilson-Jones,  99\r\n\nF.3d at  209 (\"It is clear to us  that these three . . .  factors\r\n\ncannot be kept  so permissive as to  make them collapse into  the\r\n\n'rationally  related' test  generally  used for  the  enforcement\r\n\nclauses of other constitutional amendments.\").  What was clear to\r\n\nthe Sixth  Circuit panel is  not so easy  to discern because  our\r\n\nreview \r                of \r                   Supreme \r                          Court \r                                precedent, as indicated above, convinces us\r\n\nthat Morgan does  not treat section  five differently than  other\r\n\nenforcement clauses  and  does not  depart from  the  traditional\r\n\nformulation of such clauses' broad scope.  Were the Sixth Circuit\r\n\npanel correct, we would have to conclude that Morgan  essentially\r\n\noverruled Ex parte Virginia and its progeny sub silentio. \r\n\n  2.  This case does not directly implicate the Supreme Court's\r\n  recent decision in City of Boerne v. Flores, -- S. Ct. --,\r\n  1997 WL 345322 (U.S. June 25, 1997) (No. 95-2074).  In\r\n  Boerne, the Court held that Congress' section five power to\r\n  enforce the Fourteenth Amendment does not encompass a\r\n  substantive, nonremedial power to alter or redefine what\r\n  constitutes a violation of the Constitution.  The situation\r\n  that the Court confronted in Boerne does not pertain here,\r\n  where what is at issue is congressional power to enact a\r\n  remedial scheme for the violation of federal statutory law\r\n  that includes a grant of federal jurisdiction over cases\r\n  involving private plaintiffs and states not consenting to\r\n  suit.\r\n\n                              -14-\r                                         14\r\r\n\n            We do not  read Morgan to  accomplish what the  Sixth\r\n\nCircuit suggests.  See Ramirez 715 F.2d at 698 (\"The sweep of [Ex\r\n\nparte  Virginia's]  mandate  was  reaffirmed  in  Katzenbach   v.\r\n\nMorgan.\").   Pointing  to Ex  parte  Virginia, the  Morgan  Court\r\n\nexplained that \"congressional  power under S  5 ha[s] th[e]  same\r\n\nbroad scope\"  as  McCulloch  determined Congress  has  under  the\r\n\nCommerce  Clause, as  South  Carolina  v.  Katzenbach  determined\r\n\nCongress \r                  has \r                      under section two of the Fifteenth Amendment, see 383\r\n\nU.S. \r              at \r                 326, \r                      and \r                         as \r                            James\r                                  Everard's Breweries, see 265 U.S. at 558-\r\n\n59, determined Congress  had under the enforcement clause of  the\r\n\nnow-repealed Eighteenth Amendment.  See Morgan 384 U.S. at 650-51\r\n\n(discussing cases).  On our reading of the case, we cannot  agree\r\n\nwith  the  Sixth Circuit  that  a  rearticulated  and  heightened\r\n\nFourteenth \r                    Amendment standard now applies by virtue of Morgan.  We\r\n\nthus see no  reason to doubt the  correctness of our decision  in\r\n\nRamirez\r                 \r                 regarding \r                          Morgan\r                                 \r                                 and the rational basis standard enunciated\r\n\ntherein, \r                  which \r                       we \r                          reaffirm as controlling in this circuit.  See 715\r\n\nF.2d at 698.\r\n\n            The \r                         scope \r                               of \r                                 the \r                                     rational basis test, however, requires\r\n\nsome clarification.  The Sixth Circuit defends its  rearticulated\r\n\nFourteenth Amendment  standard by  highlighting the  unacceptable\r\n\nconsequences \r                      that \r                          it \r                             believes would be attendant upon retaining the\r\n\nrational \r                  basis standard.  See Wilson-Jones, 99 F.3d at 209 (\"If we\r\n\nwere to  say that an act is valid if it is rationally related  to\r\n\nachieving \r                   equal protection of the laws, then S 5 becomes a license\r\n\n                              -15-\r                                         15\r\r\n\nto Congress to pass any sort of legislation whatsoever.\").  We do\r\n\nnot \r             agree \r                   that \r                       the \r                           rational basis test regarding enforcement of the\r\n\nFourteenth Amendment's equal protection guaranty gives Congress a\r\n\nlicense \r                 to \r                    pass \r                        any \r                            sort \r                                 of legislation whatsoever.  The Fourteenth\r\n\nAmendment does not render \"every discrimination between groups of\r\n\npeople a constitutional  denial of equal protection.\"  Oregon  v.\r\n\nMitchell,  400 U.S.  112,  127  (1970) (opinion  of  Black,  J.).\r\n\nSimilarly, every congressional action that enlargens the scope of\r\n\na law to encompass a new class of people -- thereby eliminating a\r\n\nprevious 'discrimination' that the  law had made -- is not,  ipso\r\n\nfacto, a means  towards enforcing section five of the  Fourteenth\r\n\nAmendment, because  that provision does  not \"permit Congress  to\r\n\nprohibit \r                  every discrimination between groups of people.\"  Id.

Accordingly, we have previously explained that\r\n\nit is \"irrelevant whether the activities which Congress seeks  to\r\n\nforbid \r                by \r                   legislation are themselves unconstitutional either under\r\n\nthe  Equal Protection  Clause or  under other  provisions of  the\r\n\nFourteenth Amendment,  for Congress'  reach under  the Civil  War\r\n\nAmendments has been  enlarged in order  to make these  accretions\r\n\nfully effective.\"  Ramirez, 715 F.2d at 698 (citing City of Rome,\r\n\n446 U.S. at 179; Morgan, 384 U.S. at 648-49).\r\n\n                              -19-\r                                         19\r\r\n\n            In \r                        the \r                            instant case, it would be difficult to conclude\r\n\nthat  the  probation officers  constitute  \"a  class  of  persons\r\n\ncharacterized by some unpopular trait or affiliation . . .

In other\r\n\nwords, the state employees  are neither a \"suspect class\" nor  do\r\n\nthey allege a state infringement of a \"fundamental interest,\"  as\r\n\nthose   terms  have   been   defined  in   Fourteenth   Amendment\r\n\njurisprudence.  Insofar as  any congressional enforcement of  the\r\n\nEqual \r               Protection Clause concerns the plaintiff probation officers,\r\n\ntherefore, \r                    it would be as against unreasonable and arbitrary state\r\n\naction.  To be a legitimate expression of Congress' section  five\r\n\npower to  enforce the Fourteenth  Amendment, therefore, the  1974\r\n\namendments at issue in this case, which extended the FLSA's  wage\r\n\nand  hour provisions to  states and state  employees, have to  be\r\n\n\"rational \r                   means\" towards the end \"comprehended\" in this context by\r\n\nthe \r             Equal \r                   Protection Clause, South Carolina, 383 U.S. at 324, 326,\r\n\nnamely,  the   guaranty  against   \"irrational,\"  and   therefore\r\n\n\"unjustified,\" government action.  Ramirez, 715 F.2d at 699.  \r\n\n            The  relevant  Supreme   Court  precedents  we   have\r\n\nconsidered above indicate that Congress, when acting pursuant  to\r\n\nsection five of  the Fourteenth Amendment,  can prohibit or  take\r\n\nmeasures  designed   to   remedy   unreasonable   and   arbitrary\r\n\nclassifications  made   by  states,  or   the  effects  of   such\r\n\nclassifications, and when doing so can, consistent with  Seminole\r\n\n                              -20-\r                                         20\r\r\n\nTribe, abrogate the states' sovereign immunity to suit in federal\r\n\ncourt.   Conversely,  these  precedents indicate  that  Congress'\r\n\nsection five  enforcement  power, as  it  pertains to  the  Equal\r\n\nProtection Clause in cases not involving suspect or quasi-suspect\r\n\nclasses \r                 or \r                    fundamental interests, is limited to the elimination of\r\n\narbitrariness or the effects of arbitrary government action,  and\r\n\ndoes \r              not \r                  permit \r                        Congress \r                                 to prohibit or otherwise target reasonable\r\n\nstate decisions or practices.  We believe that this limitation on\r\n\nCongress' \r                   power \r                        to \r                           enforce the Equal Protection Clause follows from\r\n\nthe end that the Clause comprehends in this specific context  and\r\n\nthe corollary fact that the Fourteenth Amendment does not  render\r\n\n\"every discrimination between  groups of people a  constitutional\r\n\ndenial \r                of \r                  equal \r                        protection.\"  Mitchell, 400 U.S. at 127 (opinion of\r\n\nBlack, \r                J.). \r                      \r                      To reiterate, the cases discussed above indicate that\r\n\nevery congressional action that  enlargens the scope of a law  to\r\n\nencompass a new class of people -- thereby eliminating a previous\r\n\n'discrimination' that the law had  made -- is not, ipso facto,  a\r\n\nmeans of enforcing the Fourteenth Amendment because section  five\r\n\ndoes \r              not \r                  \"permit Congress to prohibit every discrimination between\r\n\ngroups of people.\"  Id.\r\n\n            We evaluate the FLSA amendments at issue against this\r\n\nframework to determine whether,  in addition to being  enactments\r\n\nmade pursuant to  Congress' Commerce Clause  powers, they can  be\r\n\nviewed  appropriately as  legislation  that  enforces  the  Equal\r\n\nProtection \r                    Clause. \r                             \r                            In \r                               our estimation, one would be hard-pressed to\r\n\n                              -21-\r                                         21\r\r\n\nconclude that the  FLSA amendments at  issue here are  rationally\r\n\nrelated \r                 to \r                    eliminating any arbitrary or unreasonable state action.\r\n\nDifferences in  the manner, method,  and amount  of payment  that\r\n\nprivate sector and  state employees receive,  to the extent  they\r\n\nexist, usually  flow from a  myriad of  factors, including  state\r\n\nbudgetary concerns  and  the  levels of  public  expenditure  and\r\n\ntaxation deemed proper by  normal political processes.   However,\r\n\nnothing  in  the record  indicates  that  anything  arbitrary  or\r\n\nirrational \r                    explains or characterizes the states' practices in this\r\n\narea \r              to \r                 the \r                    extent \r                           they \r                                may be prejudicial to state employees.  Nor\r\n\ndo we  think, as the plaintiff  probation officers would have  us\r\n\nbelieve, that state employees and private sector employees are so\r\n\nsimilarly situated that  differences in how and when they  accrue\r\n\npremium pay for overtime  violates the Equal Protection  Clause's\r\n\nrequirement that \"'no person or class of persons shall be  denied\r\n\nthe same protection of the laws which is enjoyed by other persons\r\n\nor \r            other \r                  classes in the same place and under like circumstances.'\"\r\n\nWalsh\r              , \r                618 \r                    F.2d \r                        at \r                           158 \r                               (emphasis added) (quoting Lewis, 101 U.S. at\r\n\n31); \r              see\r                 , \r                   e.g\r                      ., Employees, 411 U.S. at 286 (noting the significant\r\n\ndifference \r                    between private employers and states as employers owing\r\n\nto \r            federalism \r                      concerns). \r                                  Accordingly, we conclude that we will not\r\n\n\"attribute  to Congress  an  unstated  intent to  act  under  its\r\n\nauthority \r                   to \r                      enforce \r                             the \r                                 Fourteenth Amendment,\" Pennhurst, 451 U.S.\r\n\nat 16, because on the record before us there is no evidence  that\r\n\nthe \r             1974 \r                  FLSA amendments are rationally related to the elimination\r\n\n                              -22-\r                                         22\r\r\n\nof any unreasonable and arbitrary state action, or the effects of\r\n\nsuch action, which  Congress is empowered  to remedy pursuant  to\r\n\nsection \r                 five \r                      of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Thus, we do not believe\r\n\nthat Congress can, consistent with Seminole Tribe and Fitzpatrick\r\n\nv. Bitzer,  abrogate the states'  sovereign immunity  to suit  in\r\n\nfederal court in this context. \r\n\n            In arriving at this conclusion, our analysis does not\r\n\nsuggest  any  reason  or  need for  us  to  revisit  our  earlier\r\n\npronouncements \r                        regarding \r                                 the FLSA wage and hour provisions at issue\r\n\nhere.  Specifically, we have previously determined that Congress'\r\n\n\"authority\" to  impose on  the states  the FLSA's  wage and  hour\r\n\nrequirements was \"squarely bottomed on the commerce clause.\"  New\r\n\nHampshire Dep't of Employment Sec. v.

In  so doing,  we  indicated that  the  FLSA\r\n\nprovisions  at  issue  here  differed  from  other  congressional\r\n\nlegislation, like  the Equal Pay  Act, which,  we explained,  was\r\n\napplied \"to the states as a legitimate exercise of  congressional\r\n\nauthority \r                   to \r                     adopt \r                           legislation enforcing the fourteenth amendment's\r\n\nguaranty of equal protection of  the law.\"  Id.

Today we state the corollary that we did not  explicitly\r\n\nstate \r               in \r                  so \r                     many words in Marshall:  whatever constitutional basis\r\n\nthey may have in the Commerce Clause, the 1974 amendments to  the\r\n\nFLSA in dispute again here did not apply the Act's wage and  hour\r\n\n                              -23-\r                                         23\r\r\n\nprovisions  to the  states and  state employees  as a  legitimate\r\n\nexercise of congressional  authority to  adopt legislation  under\r\n\nsection five of the Fourteenth Amendment. \r\n\n            This conclusion, of course, is fatal to the plaintiff\r\n\nprobation officers' argument on appeal because in Seminole Tribe,\r\n\nsee 116 S. Ct. at  1131-32, the Supreme Court held that  Congress\r\n\ncannot exercise  its Commerce Clause power,  or any of its  other\r\n\nArticle \r                 I \r                   powers, \r                          to \r                             abrogate a state's Eleventh Amendment immunity\r\n\nfrom \r              suit \r                   in \r                     federal \r                             court, thereby overruling the contrary rule of\r\n\nUnion Gas.  See 491 U.S. at 15 (plurality opinion).  \r\n\n            The force  of the above  line of  reasoning helps  to\r\n\nexplain  why every  post-Seminole  Tribe federal  district  court\r\n\ndecision of which we are aware has dismissed private FLSA actions\r\n\nfor \r             lack \r                  of \r                    subject \r                            matter jurisdiction, even if the reasons stated\r\n\nwere summary or did not always squarely address the section five,\r\n\nFourteenth Amendment argument  that we reject  here today.

Those  cases\r\n\narticulated a three-pronged analysis  that seeks to minimize  the\r\n\n\"visit[ation of] substantial  injustice and  hardship upon  those\r\n\nlitigants who  relied\" upon  a congressional  statute's grant  of\r\n\njurisdiction.   Marathon  Pipe Line,  458 U.S.  at 88  (plurality\r\n\nopinion) (Brennan, J.) (construing Huson). \r\n\n            There are  several  difficulties with  the  probation\r\n\nofficers' argument.  First, the Supreme Court in recent years has\r\n\nlargely rejected the pertinent propositions in both Marathon Pipe\r\n\nLine and Huson.  See  Reynoldsville Casket Co. v. Hyde, 514  U.S.\r\n\n749, \r              752 \r                  (1995) (describing Huson as having been overruled in part\r\n\nas  stated by  Harper v.  Virginia Dep't  of Tax'n,  509 U.S.  86\r\n\n(1993)).    Second,  subject  matter  jurisdiction  and  Eleventh\r\n\nAmendment \r                   immunity can be raised at any time, and when raised, the\r\n\nissue \r               is \r                  not \r                     whether \r                             the \r                                 court had jurisdiction at some time in the\r\n\npast, \r               but \r                   whether \r                          the \r                              court today still has jurisdiction.  Thus, in\r\n\na decision that  postdates the two  largely discredited cases  on\r\n\nwhich the  state employees in this  dispute so heavily rely,  the\r\n\nSupreme Court has  emphasized that \"'a court lacks discretion  to\r\n\n                              -26-\r                                         26\r\r\n\nconsider  the  merits  of  a  case  over  which  it  is   without\r\n\njurisdiction,\r                       and thus, by definition, a jurisdictional ruling may\r\n\nnever be made prospective only.'\"  Budinich v.

The probation officers also argue that litigants\r\n\nare generally afforded the right to undertake discovery when they\r\n\nare faced with a jurisdictional bar.  See Gould, Inc. v.

Cf. Manypenny v.  United States, 948 F.2d  1057,\r\n\n1066-67 (8th  Cir. 1991)  (plaintiffs identify  White Earth  Land\r\n\nSettlement \r                    Act); Yorktown Med. Lab., Inc. v. Perales, 948 F.2d 84,\r\n\n88 (2d Cir.  1991) (plaintiff identifies  Boren Amendment to  the\r\n\nMedicaid Act).  But cf. Baxter v. Vigo County Sch.

In other words, Maine argues, the plaintiffs  \"not\r\n\nonly want to conduct  a fishing expedition, they want to  conduct\r\n\ndiscovery in  order to locate  the lake in  which to conduct  the\r\n\nfishing expedition.\"  We  believe that this assessment,  whatever\r\n\nelse it may be, sufficiently describes the situation  confronting\r\n\n  3.  While our subsequent decision in Reopell v.\r\n  Massachusetts, 936 F.2d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 1991) reversed one\r\n  of WJM's holdings regarding prejudgment interest in light of\r\n  the Supreme Court's intervening decision in Missouri v.\r\n  Jenkins, 491 U.S. 274 (1989), we note that the proposition\r\n  for which we cite WJM remains intact.       \r\n\n                              -29-\r                                         29\r\r\n\nus, and on these facts we cannot conclude, particularly given the\r\n\nstringent waiver standard articulated in Atascadero and WJM, that\r\n\nthe  district court  abused its  discretion in  deciding to  deny\r\n\ndiscovery \r                   on \r                      the plaintiffs' motion.

In Weaver, the Third Circuit confronted\r\n\nan arguably similar situation in which plaintiffs had  originally\r\n\nfiled their claim in  federal court believing that the court  had\r\n\nsubject matter  jurisdiction under federal  securities law.   The\r\n\nSupreme Court subsequently ruled that the plaintiffs had no  such\r\n\nclaim.  See Weaver v. Marine Bank, 455 U.S. 551, 559 (1982).   On\r\n\nremand, there  was no other federal  question upon which to  base\r\n\njurisdiction, diversity was lacking, and the Third Circuit  faced\r\n\n                              -31-\r                                         31\r\r\n\nthe \r             possibility \r                         that \r                             the \r                                 plaintiffs' cause of action in state court\r\n\nwould be  time-barred.  See 683 F.2d  at 745-46.  In this set  of\r\n\ncircumstances\r                      , the Third Circuit took the step of transferring the\r\n\nmatter \r                to \r                   state court pursuant to a Pennsylvania enabling statute.\r\n\nSee id. at 748. \r\n\n            Maine  does  not have  a  statute  identical  to  the\r\n\nPennsylvania law  upon which the  Third Circuit  relied, but  the\r\n\nprobation officers indicate that Maine has a savings statute that\r\n\npermits cases  to be  transferred to  the proper  court when  the\r\n\noriginal action fails \"for any  matter of form.\"  Me.

(quoting Lehman Bros. v. Schein, 416 U.S. 386,\r\n\n391 (1974)). \r\n\n            The Pennsylvania enabling  statute that rests at  the\r\n\nheart of Weaver bears no resemblance to the Maine general savings\r\n\nstatute in this case from which the appellants seek succor.   See\r\n\nMe. Rev.  Stat. Ann. tit. 14, S 855.  The Maine statute makes  no\r\n\nmention \r                 of \r                    transfer and only permits a re-filing in state court of\r\n\na case that  has been  \"defeated for any  matter of  form.\"   Id.\r\n\nNeither the parties' nor our own research has uncovered any Maine\r\n\ncaselaw \r                 that \r                     addresses \r                               whether this description would encompass the\r\n\ncase at bar as a matter of state law.  We note,  however, that on\r\n\nour  reading  of the  statute  we  glean no  manifestation  of  a\r\n\nwillingness \r                     on the part of the State of Maine analogous to that of\r\n\nthe \r             Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to accept jurisdiction over cases\r\n\nimprovidently \r                       filed \r                            in \r                               federal court with relation back to the time\r\n\n                              -33-\r                                         33\r\r\n\nof \r            the \r                filing of the case in federal court.  The importance of the\r\n\nPennsylvania \r                      statute and its specialized provisions to the outcome\r\n\nin Weaver  is evident when one  considers that the Third  Circuit\r\n\nsubsequently  has  explicitly  stated  that  \"[a]bsent  statutory\r\n\nauthority,  the traditional  general rule  that a  court may  not\r\n\ntransfer a  matter  over which  it lacks  jurisdiction  governs.\"\r\n\nShendock v. Director, Office of Workers' Comp. Programs, 893 F.2d\r\n\n1458,      1467      (3rd     Cir.     1990)     (en      banc). \r\n\n            While \r                           we \r                              express \r                                     no \r                                        view \r                                             on the question of whether the\r\n\nThird Circuit's  analysis in Weaver  warrants our agreement,4  we\r\n\nbelieve that there can be no question that, in the absence of any\r\n\nspecialized state statute, \"it is the duty of the trial court, if\r\n\nit finds that jurisdiction does not exist, to proceed no  further\r\n\nbut to  dismiss the suit.\"  Joy v. Hague, 175 F.2d 395, 396  (1st\r\n\nCir. 1949)  (emphasis  added) (citing  McNutt v.  General  Motors\r\n\nAcceptance Corp., 298 U.S. 178, 182 (1936)). \r\n\n  4.  We note, however, that we have previously rejected as\r\n  \"unpersuasive\" decisions from other circuits that \"stand for\r\n  the proposition that a court bereft of jurisdiction has an\r\n  'inherent power' to transfer\" a case.  Dantes, 614 F.3d at\r\n  301 n.2 (criticizing Pearce v. Director, Office of Workers'\r\n  Comp. Programs, 603 F.2d 763, 771 (9th Cir. 1979) and Dayton\r\n  Power &amp; Light Co. v.

This motion constitutes an eleventh hour attempt\r\n\nby plaintiffs to bring their case under the aegis of the doctrine\r\n\nof Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), and thereby overcome  the\r\n\nEleventh \r                  Amendment bar to their FLSA action.  For the reasons that\r\n\nfollow, we deny the motion.\r\n\n            Although  not  the  routine,  appellate  courts  have\r\n\nauthority \r                   to \r                      allow amendments to complaints because \"'[t]here is .\r\n\n. . in the nature of . . . appellate jurisdiction, nothing  which\r\n\nforbids the  granting  of amendments.'\"   Newman-Green,  Inc.  v.\r\n\nAlfonzo-Larra\r                      in, 490 U.S. 826, 834 (1989) (quoting Anonymous, 1 F.\r\n\nCas.  996,  997  (C.C. Mass.  1812)  (No.  444)  (Story,  Circuit\r\n\nJustice)).  This feature of appellate court power \"long  predates\r\n\nthe enactment  of the Federal Rules,\"  and stems from common  law\r\n\npractice, \r                   which \r                        \"permitted 'the superior court . . .

Rep. 631 (K.B.  1751)).  See  28\r\n\nU.S.C. S  1653  (\"Defective allegations  of jurisdiction  may  be\r\n\namended, upon terms, in the trial or appellate courts.\"). \r\n\n            The \r                         plaintiff probation officers' argument in favor of\r\n\ntheir \r               motion \r                      rests on three arguments.  The first is the amendment\r\n\n                              -35-\r                                         35\r\r\n\nauthorization contained in 28 U.S.C.  S 1653.  The second is  the\r\n\ndoctrine of Ex parte Young, which allows plaintiffs to avoid  the\r\n\nEleventh Amendment bar by naming a state officer in his  official\r\n\ncapacity in cases  where prospective  declaratory and  injunctive\r\n\nrelief is  sought under federal  law.  The  third is the  liberal\r\n\nstandard of Rule 15(a)  of the Federal Rules of Civil  Procedure,\r\n\nwhich, in relevant part, provides:\r\n\n          A \r                     party \r                           may \r                               amend the party's pleading once as\r\n          a matter  of  course  at any  time  before  a\r\n          responsive  pleading  is  served  .  .  .   .\r\n          Otherwise  a  party  may  amend  the  party's\r\n          pleading only by leave of court or by written\r\n          consent of the adverse party; and leave shall\r\n          be freely given when justice so requires.\r\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) (emphasis added). \r\n\n            While intriguing at  first glance, closer  inspection\r\n\nreveals that the plaintiffs-appellants' argument runs aground  at\r\n\neach \r              juncture. \r                         \r                        In \r                           the \r                               first place, 28 U.S.C. S 1653 does not allow\r\n\nwhat the  probation  officers seek  here.   Section  1653  allows\r\n\namendments to  cure  \"[d]efective allegations  of  jurisdiction.\"\r\n\n(emphasis added).    This statutory  language \"suggests  that  it\r\n\naddresses  only  incorrect  statements  about  jurisdiction  that\r\n\nactually exists,  and  not defects  in the  jurisdictional  facts\r\n\nthemselves.\"  Newman-Green,  490 U.S. at 831.  Specifically,  the\r\n\nNewman-Green  Court  refused   to  interpret   section  1653   as\r\n\n\"empower[ing]\r                       federal courts to amend a complaint so as to produce\r\n\njurisdiction where none actually existed before.\"  Id.\r\n\n                              -36-\r                                         36\r\r\n\n            The \r                         Newman-Green\r                                     \r                                     Court's \r                                             interpretation of section 1653\r\n\nthus precludes the amendment that the probation officers  desire.\r\n\nThe \r             unequivocal rule of Newman-Green is that section 1653 does not\r\n\nauthorize \r                   the \r                      addition \r                               or elimination of parties in order to create\r\n\njurisdiction where jurisdiction does not exist.  See Newman-Green\r\n\nat  830-31.   This rule  is fatal  to the  plaintiffs-appellants'\r\n\nargument because this is  exactly the relief they seek in  asking\r\n\nthat their  complaint be amended  by adding  the Commissioner  of\r\n\nCorrections as a new party defendant.\r\n\n            Moreover, \r                               we \r                                 reiterate \r                                           our view that, where a party has\r\n\nhad an opportunity to seek to amend its pleadings in the district\r\n\ncourt, \r                it \r                   is \r                     not \r                         appropriate for that party belatedly to seek leave\r\n\nto \r            amend \r                  on \r                    appeal \r                           pursuant to 28 U.S.C.

The  only\r\n\nrelief that the plaintiffs have sought in this case, prior to the\r\n\nfiling \r                of \r                   their \r                        proposed \r                                 amendment on appeal, has been unpaid wages\r\n\nand \r             liquidated \r                       damages \r                               under the FLSA.  Ex parte Young allows a way\r\n\naround the  bar to federal  jurisdiction erected  by the  Supreme\r\n\nCourt's  Eleventh Amendment  jurisprudence  only in  cases  where\r\n\nprospective  declaratory or  injunctive  relief is  sought  under\r\n\nfederal \r                 law. \r                       See Seminole Tribe, 116 S.

We are not unmindful of the Supreme Court's recent\r\n  decision in Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe of Idaho, -- S. Ct. \r\n  --, 1997 WL 338603 (U.S. June 23, 1997) (No. 94-1474), which\r\n  cabins and limits the availability of the Ex parte Young\r\n  doctrine even where prospective declaratory and injunctive\r\n  relief is sought against state officers in their individual\r\n  capacities for allegedly ongoing violations of federal law. \r\n  This new development in the Court's jurisprudence is not\r\n  implicated here.  Unlike Coeur d'Alene, this case does not\r\n  involve an ongoing violation of federal law, but instead\r\n  concerns a backwards-looking dispute over past FLSA\r\n  violations by the State of Maine and possible overtime back\r\n  pay owed the plaintiff probation officers as a result. \r\n\n                              -39-\r                                         39\r\r\n\nreasons \r                 that \r                      also exist in this case.  First, the Court in Mansour\r\n\nnoted that  monetary  relief was  not  available because  it  was\r\n\n\"prohibited by the Eleventh Amendment.\"  Id. at 73.  Second,  the\r\n\nCourt \r               explained \r                        that \r                             \"[b]ecause there is no continuing violation of\r\n\nfederal  law  to  enjoin  in this  case,  an  injunction  is  not\r\n\navailable.\"  Id. at  71.  Third, the  Court conceded that it  had\r\n\nconstrued the Declaratory Judgment Act of 1934, 28 U.S.C. S 2201,\r\n\nto mean that \"declaratory relief may be available even though  an\r\n\ninjunction is not,\" but explained  that it had also \"held that  a\r\n\ndeclaratory judgment is not available in a number of  instances.\"\r\n\nId.\r             \r             at \r                72. \r                     \r                     Specifically, declaratory relief was unavailable where\r\n\n\"the  award of  declaratory judgment  . .  . would  be useful  in\r\n\nresolving the  dispute over the  past lawfulness of  respondent's\r\n\naction only if it might be offered in state-court proceedings  as\r\n\nres \r             judicata \r                      on \r                        the \r                            issue of liability, leaving to the state courts\r\n\nonly \r              a \r                form \r                    of \r                       accounting proceeding whereby damages or restitution\r\n\ncould be computed.\"   Id. at 73.   The Court concluded that  \"the\r\n\nissuance of a declaratory  judgment in these circumstances  would\r\n\nhave much the same effect  as a full-fledged award of damages  or\r\n\nrestitution \r                     by the federal court, the latter kinds of relief being\r\n\nof course prohibited by the Eleventh Amendment.\"  Id. \r\n\n            In \r                        view \r                             of \r                                the marked similarity between the situation\r\n\nthat confronted the Mansour  Court and that confronts us in  this\r\n\ncase,  we cannot  help  but  note Mansour's  admonition  that  \"a\r\n\ndeclaratory judgment is not available when the result would be  a\r\n\n                              -40-\r                                         40\r\r\n\npartial \r                 'end \r                      run'\" around the rest of the Supreme Court's Eleventh\r\n\nAmendment jurisprudence, particularly  its limitations on the  Ex\r\n\nparte Young doctrine.  Id.\r\n\n            Moreover, Seminole Tribe suggests that the  probation\r\n\nofficers could not seek  injunctive relief, even if there were  a\r\n\ncontinuing \r                    violation \r                             in \r                                this case, because the FLSA only authorizes\r\n\nthe  Secretary  of Labor  to  seek  injunctive  relief,  limiting\r\n\nemployees \r                   to \r                      suits \r                           for \r                               unpaid wages and liquidated damages.  See 29\r\n\nU.S.C. SS 216,  217; cf. Donovan v.  Brown Equip. &amp; Serv.  Tools,\r\n\nInc., 666 F.2d 148, 155-56 (5th Cir. 1982) (reviewing legislative\r\n\nhistory).  In the face of this statutory scheme, the  appellants'\r\n\nmotion to amend their complaint is particularly suspect.  As  the\r\n\nSupreme Court  explained in Seminole  Tribe, \"where Congress  has\r\n\nprescribed a detailed remedial scheme for the enforcement against\r\n\na State of a  statutorily created right, a court should  hesitate\r\n\nbefore casting aside those  limitations and permitting an  action\r\n\nagainst \r                 a \r                   state officer based upon Ex parte Young.\"  116 S. Ct. at\r\n\n1132.7 \r\n\n            In sum,  with no right on  the part of the  plaintiff\r\n\nprobation officers  to seek  retroactive money  damages, with  no\r\n\ncontinuing violation  to justify injunctive  relief, and with  no\r\n\nclearly apparent  right on  the part  of the  plaintiffs to  seek\r\n\n  7.  We believe that the Sixth Circuit's view on this matter\r\n  may thus be precluded by Seminole Tribe.  See Wilson-Jones,\r\n  99 F.3d at 211 (arguing that state employees can invoke Ex\r\n  parte Young to sue a state officer in federal court for\r\n  injunctive relief).\r\n\n                              -41-\r                                         41\r\r\n\ninjunctive relief  even if a  continuing violation were  present,\r\n\ndeclaratory relief, as in Green v. Mansour, would serve no useful\r\n\npurpose. \r                   \r                   See\r                       \r                      474 \r                          U.S. \r                               at 73.  The only possible use of declaratory\r\n\nrelief in this case now would be for the purpose of asserting res\r\n\njudicata in state court  proceedings.  As we saw above,  however,\r\n\nMansour\r                 \r                 precludes this option as an impermissible \"end run\" around\r\n\nEleventh \r                  Amendment \r                           jurisprudence because the result would be little\r\n\ndifferent than a  prohibited direct federal court award of  money\r\n\ndamages against the state to  the extent it would reduce a  state\r\n\ncourt \r               proceeding \r                          into \r                              a \r                                mere accounting session \"whereby damages or\r\n\nrestitution could be computed.\"  Id.       \r\n\n            The  Supreme  Court   has  identified   a  range   of\r\n\ncircumstances, including undue  delay and futility of  amendment,\r\n\nthat should preclude  granting a motion to  amend.  See Foman  v.\r\n\nDavis\r              , \r                371 \r                    U.S. \r                        178, \r                             182 \r                                 (1962) (construing Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)).\r\n\nSuffice  to say  that  the panoply  of  legal arguments  we  have\r\n\ncanvassed above indicates that the plaintiff probation  officers'\r\n\neleventh hour motion  to amend to  seek declaratory relief  fails\r\n\nunder \r               more \r                    than one prong of the Foman standard.  In particular, a\r\n\ndeclaratory judgment is unavailable  where, as here, the  parties\r\n\nagree that there is no ongoing legal violation.8\r\n\n  8.  This case thus differs from one that the Third Circuit\r\n  recently confronted when it granted a motion to amend brought\r\n  on appeal by state employees seeking to add a new party\r\n  defendant (the Commissioner) and a claim for prospective\r\n  declaratory relief to their pending FLSA claim for overtime\r\n  compensation.  See Balgowan v. New Jersey, Dep't of Transp.,\r\n  -- F.3d --, 1997 WL 305290 (3rd Cir. 1997) (granting the\r\n\n                              -42-\r                                         42\r\r\n\n                           Conclusion\r\n\n            In concluding, we stress that our decision today does\r\n\nnot  remove state  employees from  the  aegis of  the FLSA.    In\r\n\ndetermining that Seminole  Tribe controls this  case and that  no\r\n\nfederal jurisdiction  exists, our decision  only relates to  that\r\n\nportion  of  the  FLSA  that  purports  to  give  federal  courts\r\n\njurisdiction \r                      over \r                          private FLSA actions brought by employees against\r\n\nstates.

Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 116 S.Ct. 1114, 134 L.Ed.2d 252 (1996), bars a federal suit for overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\") brought by state employees against the State of Maine.  The district court concluded that Seminole Tribe was a bar and dismissed the suit.  For the reasons that follow, we affirm that ruling and thus find unconstitutional a grant of federal court jurisdiction contained in a provision of 29 U.S.C. &#167; 216(b).  We also deny a motion made on appeal by plaintiffs-appellants to amend their complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Background and Prior Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, filed in federal district court in December 1992, ninety-six current and former probation and parole officers (plaintiffs-appellants) have asserted that the State of Maine improperly failed to pay them overtime in accordance with the requirements imposed by Section 7 of the FLSA, as codified at 29 U.S.C. &#167; 207.  Maine contended that the probation officers were exempt from the FLSA's overtime provisions.  The district court concluded that the plaintiffs were covered employees but came within the FLSA's partial exemption for law enforcement officers, thus requiring additional proceedings on the scope of Maine's liability and the damages recoverable by the probation officers, if any.  Following the district court's ruling, the state brought itself into compliance with the FLSA's wage and hour requirements, but because the litigants disputed how much overtime back pay Maine owed the probation officers, the district court submitted the plaintiffs' claims and time sheets to a special master.  See Mills v. Maine, 853 F.Supp. 551, 552 (D.Me.1994) (ruling on \"issues affecting what damages the State must pay the probation officers\");  Mills v.

Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 116 S.Ct. 1114, 134 L.Ed.2d 252 (1996).  Seminole Tribe held that Congress cannot exercise its Article I powers to abrogate the states' Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in federal court, see id. at ---- - ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1131-32, and thus overruled Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U.S. 1, 109 S.Ct. 2273, 105 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989).  On the basis of the holding in Seminole Tribe, Maine filed a motion with the district court asking that the case be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  The district court granted the motion and dismissed the case pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1).  See Mills v. State, No. 92-410-P-H, 1996 WL 400510 (D.Me. July 3, 1996).  In so doing, the district court refused the probation officers' request that the court either allow them to conduct discovery on whether Maine waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity or, alternatively, transfer the case to state court.

The constitutional validity of the Act's minimum wage, maximum hour, and record-keeping requirements, in addition to its prohibition of interstate shipment of proscribed goods, was challenged under the Commerce Clause as well as the Fifth and Tenth Amendments.  A unanimous Supreme Court upheld the Act in 1941.  See United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100, 61 S.Ct. 451, 85 L.Ed. 609 (1941).  While the original 1938 Act specifically excluded states and their political subdivisions from its aegis, Congress amended the FLSA in 1961 and 1966 to extend coverage to some state workers employed in state schools, hospitals, and nursing homes.  These amendments were challenged under the Tenth Amendment, but the Supreme Court ruled in 1968 that the amendments were legitimate expressions of Congress' Commerce Clause powers.  See Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U.S. 183, 198-99, 88 S.Ct. 2017, 2024-25, 20 L.Ed.2d 1020 (1968).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1973, however, the Supreme Court concluded that the FLSA did not subject states to suits brought by state employees in federal court because Congress had not indicated with sufficient clarity an intent to abrogate the states' Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity.  See Employees of the Dep't of Pub. Health &amp; Welfare v. Department of Pub. Health &amp; Welfare, 411 U.S. 279, 285, 93 S.Ct. 1614, 1618, 36 L.Ed.2d 251 (1973).

Two years later, however, in 1976, the Supreme Court overruled Wirtz, and held that Congress did not have the power to extend FLSA protections to state employees in \"areas of traditional governmental functions.\"  National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U.S. 833, 855, 96 S.Ct. 2465, 2476, 49 L.Ed.2d 245 (1976) (5-4 decision).  In 1985, however, the Supreme Court reversed itself yet again and overruled Usery in Garcia v. San Antonio Metro.  Transit Auth., 469 U.S. 528, 105 S.Ct. 1005, 83 L.Ed.2d 1016 (1985) (5-4 decision).  \"The result of Garcia was to bring all employees of the states and their political subdivisions within the full coverage of the FLSA.\"  Gilbreath v.

The Act, as amended, defines \"Employer\" as \"any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee and includes a public agency.\"  29 U.S.C. &#167; 203(d).  In relevant part, it further provides that, \"In the case of an individual employed by a public agency, such term means ... any individual employed by a State, political subdivision of a State, or an interstate governmental agency.\"  29 U.S.C. &#167; 203(e)(2),(C).  Finally, the Act, as amended, provides in pertinent part that, \"An action to recover the liability prescribed ... may be maintained against any employer (including a public agency) in any Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction by any one or more employees.\"  29 U.S.C. &#167; 216(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of this language and the history surrounding it, we agree with the other courts of appeals that have examined the FLSA's provisions and have concluded that the Act contains the necessary clear statement of congressional intent to abrogate state sovereign immunity.

See 517 U.S. at ---- - ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1131-32.

Indeed, the State of Maine essentially contends that because Congress invoked its Commerce Clause powers in passing the FLSA and the amendments pertinent to this dispute, the statute cannot be justified under section five of the Fourteenth Amendment or any constitutional provision other than the Commerce Clause.  Even considering Pennhurst 's 'proceed with caution' rule, the problem with this argument is that it is contrary to binding Supreme Court precedent and prior decisions of this circuit and is not logical.  As other federal courts have explained in looking at the 1974 amendments to the FLSA, one cannot read Congress' statement regarding the Act's validity under the Commerce Clause to \"indicat[e] that Congress intended to exclude other applicable constitutional bases for the Act.\"  Brown v. County of Santa Barbara, 427 F.Supp. 112, 114 (C.D.Cal.1977) (citing Usery v.

Virtually identical language is also found in the Thirteenth, Fifteenth, Eighteenth, Nineteenth, Twenty-third, Twenty-fourth, and Twenty-sixth Amendments.  When determining whether congressional enactments are \"appropriate\" and valid exercises of enforcement clause powers such as the one at issue here, Supreme Court precedent indicates that we look to whether the act is a \"rational means\" to an end that is \"comprehended\" by the underlying constitutional amendment.  South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 324, 326, 86 S.Ct. 803, 817-18, 15 L.Ed.2d 769 (1966) (upholding Voting Rights Act of 1965 under the Fifteenth Amendment's enforcement clause);  see also James Everard's Breweries v.

Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641, 650, 86 S.Ct. 1717, 1723, 16 L.Ed.2d 828 (1966).  The operative Fourteenth Amendment test is indeed little more than a paraphrasing of Chief Justice Marshall's formulation.  See id. at 650-51, 86 S.Ct. at 1723-24;  Ex parte Virginia, 100 U.S. 339, 345-46, 25 L.Ed. 676 (1879) (interpreting scope of congressional power under the enforcement clauses of the Reconstruction Amendments).  In Morgan, the Supreme Court articulated a three-pronged test for determining whether congressional legislation is enacted to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.  Specifically, the Court determined that a congressional enactment is \"appropriate legislation\" under section five for Equal Protection purposes in the following circumstances:  (1) if it \"may be regarded as an enactment to enforce the Equal Protection Clause,\" (2) if it \"is 'plainly adapted to that end,' \" and (3) if it \"is not prohibited by but is consistent with 'the letter and spirit of the constitution.' \"  Morgan, 384 U.S. at 651, 86 S.Ct. at 1724 (quoting McCulloch, 17 U.S.  (4 Wheat.) at 421).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sixth Circuit has concluded that the three Morgan factors effectively reworked the longstanding constitutional test we have outlined above by requiring something more than a rational relationship between a congressional enactment and the ends comprehended by the Fourteenth Amendment.  See Wilson-Jones, 99 F.3d at 209 (\"It is clear to us that these three ... factors cannot be kept so permissive as to make them collapse into the 'rationally related' test generally used for the enforcement clauses of other constitutional amendments.\").  What was clear to the Sixth Circuit panel is not so easy to discern because our review of Supreme Court precedent, as indicated above, convinces us that Morgan does not treat section five differently than other enforcement clauses and does not depart from the traditional formulation of such clauses' broad scope.  Were the Sixth Circuit panel correct, we would have to conclude that Morgan essentially overruled Ex parte Virginia and its progeny sub silentio.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not read Morgan to accomplish what the Sixth Circuit suggests.  See Ramirez 715 F.2d at 698 (\"The sweep of [Ex parte Virginia 's] mandate was reaffirmed in Katzenbach v. Morgan.\").   Pointing to Ex parte Virginia, the Morgan Court explained that \"congressional power under &#167; 5 ha[s] th[e] same broad scope\" as McCulloch determined Congress has under the Commerce Clause, as South Carolina v. Katzenbach determined Congress has under section two of the Fifteenth Amendment, see 383 U.S. at 326, 86 S.Ct. at 817-18, and as James Everard's Breweries, see 265 U.S. at 558-59, 44 S.Ct. at 631, determined Congress had under the enforcement clause of the now-repealed Eighteenth Amendment.  See Morgan 384 U.S. at 650-51, 86 S.Ct. at 1723-24 (discussing cases).  On our reading of the case, we cannot agree with the Sixth Circuit that a rearticulated and heightened Fourteenth Amendment standard now applies by virtue of Morgan.   We thus see no reason to doubt the correctness of our decision in Ramirez regarding Morgan and the rational basis standard enunciated therein, which we reaffirm as controlling in this circuit.  See 715 F.2d at 698.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The scope of the rational basis test, however, requires some clarification.  The Sixth Circuit defends its rearticulated Fourteenth Amendment standard by highlighting the unacceptable consequences that it believes would be attendant upon retaining the rational basis standard.  See Wilson-Jones, 99 F.3d at 209 (\"If we were to say that an act is valid if it is rationally related to achieving equal protection of the laws, then &#167; 5 becomes a license to Congress to pass any sort of legislation whatsoever.\").  We do not agree that the rational basis test regarding enforcement of the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection guaranty gives Congress a license to pass any sort of legislation whatsoever.  The Fourteenth Amendment does not render \"every discrimination between groups of people a constitutional denial of equal protection.\"  Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112, 127, 91 S.Ct. 260, 266, 27 L.Ed.2d 272 (1970) (opinion of Black, J.).  Similarly, every congressional action that enlargens the scope of a law to encompass a new class of people--thereby eliminating a previous 'discrimination' that the law had made--is not, ipso facto, a means towards enforcing section five of the Fourteenth Amendment, because that provision does not \"permit Congress to prohibit every discrimination between groups of people.\"  Id. Put in a different fashion, \" '[t]he Fourteenth Amendment does not profess to secure to all persons in the United States the benefit of the same laws and the same remedies.' \"  Holden v. Hardy, 169 U.S. 366, 388, 18 S.Ct. 383, 386, 42 L.Ed. 780 (1898) (quoting Missouri v.

Whereas, as is well-known, classifications aimed at \"suspect\" classes or those aimed at \"fundamental\" interests must pass strict scrutiny, see, e.g., Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 11-12, 87 S.Ct. 1817, 1823-24, 18 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1967), or, in the case of sex discrimination, intermediate review, see, e.g., Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 197-99, 97 S.Ct. 451, 456-58, 50 L.Ed.2d 397 (1976), more mundane government classifications that do not target such groups or interests are subject only to more deferential rational basis review.  Accordingly, government legislation or action \"[i]n the area of economics and social welfare does not violate the Equal Protection Clause merely because the classifications [it makes] are imperfect,\" Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 485, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 1161, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1970), because \"[i]t is no requirement of equal protection that all evils of the same genus be eradicated or none at all.\"  Railway Express Agency, Inc. v. New York, 336 U.S. 106, 110, 69 S.Ct. 463, 466, 93 L.Ed. 533 (1949).  Instead, in this subset of concerns, the Equal Protection Clause requires \"that cities, states and the Federal Government must exercise their powers so as not to discriminate between their inhabitants except upon some reasonable differentiation fairly related to the object of regulation.\"  Id. at 112, 69 S.Ct. at 466 (Jackson, J., concurring).  Viewed against this backdrop, \"[e]qual protection of the laws means that 'no person or class of persons shall be denied the same protection of the laws which is enjoyed by other persons or other classes in the same place and under like circumstances.' \"  Walsh v.

In other words, the state employees are neither a \"suspect class\" nor do they allege a state infringement of a \"fundamental interest,\" as those terms have been defined in Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence.  Insofar as any congressional enforcement of the Equal Protection Clause concerns the plaintiff probation officers, therefore, it would be as against unreasonable and arbitrary state action.  To be a legitimate expression of Congress' section five power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment, therefore, the 1974 amendments at issue in this case, which extended the FLSA's wage and hour provisions to states and state employees, have to be \"rational means\" towards the end \"comprehended\" in this context by the Equal Protection Clause, South Carolina, 383 U.S. at 324, 326, 86 S.Ct. at 816, 817-18, namely, the guaranty against \"irrational,\" and therefore \"unjustified,\" government action.  Ramirez, 715 F.2d at 699.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevant Supreme Court precedents we have considered above indicate that Congress, when acting pursuant to section five of the Fourteenth Amendment, can prohibit or take measures designed to remedy unreasonable and arbitrary classifications made by states, or the effects of such classifications, and when doing so can, consistent with Seminole Tribe, abrogate the states' sovereign immunity to suit in federal court.  Conversely, these precedents indicate that Congress' section five enforcement power, as it pertains to the Equal Protection Clause in cases not involving suspect or quasi-suspect classes or fundamental interests, is limited to the elimination of arbitrariness or the effects of arbitrary government action, and does not permit Congress to prohibit or otherwise target reasonable state decisions or practices.  We believe that this limitation on Congress' power to enforce the Equal Protection Clause follows from the end that the Clause comprehends in this specific context and the corollary fact that the Fourteenth Amendment does not render \"every discrimination between groups of people a constitutional denial of equal protection.\"  Mitchell, 400 U.S. at 127, 91 S.Ct. at 266 (opinion of Black, J.).  To reiterate, the cases discussed above indicate that every congressional action that enlargens the scope of a law to encompass a new class of people--thereby eliminating a previous 'discrimination' that the law had made--is not, ipso facto, a means of enforcing the Fourteenth Amendment because section five does not \"permit Congress to prohibit every discrimination between groups of people.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We evaluate the FLSA amendments at issue against this framework to determine whether, in addition to being enactments made pursuant to Congress' Commerce Clause powers, they can be viewed appropriately as legislation that enforces the Equal Protection Clause.  In our estimation, one would be hard-pressed to conclude that the FLSA amendments at issue here are rationally related to eliminating any arbitrary or unreasonable state action.  Differences in the manner, method, and amount of payment that private sector and state employees receive, to the extent they exist, usually flow from a myriad of factors, including state budgetary concerns and the levels of public expenditure and taxation deemed proper by normal political processes.  However, nothing in the record indicates that anything arbitrary or irrational explains or characterizes the states' practices in this area to the extent they may be prejudicial to state employees.  Nor do we think, as the plaintiff probation officers would have us believe, that state employees and private sector employees are so similarly situated that differences in how and when they accrue premium pay for overtime violates the Equal Protection Clause's requirement that \" 'no person or class of persons shall be denied the same protection of the laws which is enjoyed by other persons or other classes in the same place and under like circumstances.' \"  Walsh, 618 F.2d at 158 (emphasis added) (quoting Lewis, 101 U.S. at 31);  see, e.g., Employees, 411 U.S. at 286, 93 S.Ct. at 1618 (noting the significant difference between private employers and states as employers owing to federalism concerns).  Accordingly, we conclude that we will not \"attribute to Congress an unstated intent to act under its authority to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment,\" Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 16, 101 S.Ct. at 1539, because on the record before us there is no evidence that the 1974 FLSA amendments are rationally related to the elimination of any unreasonable and arbitrary state action, or the effects of such action, which Congress is empowered to remedy pursuant to section five of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Thus, we do not believe that Congress can, consistent with Seminole Tribe and Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, abrogate the states' sovereign immunity to suit in federal court in this context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In arriving at this conclusion, our analysis does not suggest any reason or need for us to revisit our earlier pronouncements regarding the FLSA wage and hour provisions at issue here.  Specifically, we have previously determined that Congress' \"authority\" to impose on the states the FLSA's wage and hour requirements was \"squarely bottomed on the commerce clause.\"  New Hampshire Dep't of Employment Sec. v. Marshall, 616 F.2d 240, 247 (1st Cir.1980).  In so doing, we indicated that the FLSA provisions at issue here differed from other congressional legislation, like the Equal Pay Act, which, we explained, was applied \"to the states as a legitimate exercise of congressional authority to adopt legislation enforcing the fourteenth amendment's guaranty of equal protection of the law.\"  Id. (citing Usery v. Charleston County Sch. Dist., 558 F.2d 1169 (4th Cir.1977);  Usery v. Allegheny County Institution Dist., 544 F.2d 148 (3d Cir.1976)).  Today we state the corollary that we did not explicitly state in so many words in Marshall:  whatever constitutional basis they may have in the Commerce Clause, the 1974 amendments to the FLSA in dispute again here did not apply the Act's wage and hour provisions to the states and state employees as a legitimate exercise of congressional authority to adopt legislation under section five of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion, of course, is fatal to the plaintiff probation officers' argument on appeal because in Seminole Tribe, see 517 U.S. at ---- - ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1131-32, the Supreme Court held that Congress cannot exercise its Commerce Clause power, or any of its other Article I powers, to abrogate a state's Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in federal court, thereby overruling the contrary rule of Union Gas.  See 491 U.S. at 15, 109 S.Ct. at 2282 (plurality opinion).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The force of the above line of reasoning helps to explain why every post-Seminole Tribe federal district court decision of which we are aware has dismissed private FLSA actions for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, even if the reasons stated were summary or did not always squarely address the section five, Fourteenth Amendment argument that we reject here today.  See, e.g., Raper v. Iowa, 940 F.Supp. 1421 (S.D.Iowa 1996) (dismissing case and rejecting Fourteenth Amendment theory of the FLSA);  Chauvin v. Louisiana, 937 F.Supp. 567, 570 (E.D.La.1996) (same);  Powell v. Florida, No. 95-6233-CIV-ZLOCH (S.D.Fla. August 6, 1996) (same);  Walden v. Florida Dep't of Corrections, TCA 95-40357-WS (N.D. Fla.

See, e.g., Daniel J. Meltzer, The Seminole Decision and State Sovereign Immunity, 1996 Sup.Ct. Rev. 1, 49 &amp; n. 230 (noting that the merits of the section five \"strategy,\" while varying with different statutes, \"would be hard to execute as to the Fair Labor Standards Act,\" in part because it is doubtful that \"the Supreme Court would accept an argument that would so sharply limit the effective scope of Seminole \").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Retroactivity of Seminole Tribe</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having concluded that Seminole Tribe controls, we next consider whether we should apply it retroactively to this case, which was properly pending in federal court before the Supreme Court overruled Union Gas.  The plaintiff probation officers ask that in the event we do not agree with their section five, equal protection argument, we refrain from dismissing their federal suit by applying the equitable standards articulated in Northern Pipeline Constr.  Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U.S. 50, 102 S.Ct. 2858, 73 L.Ed.2d 598 (1982), and Chevron Oil v. Huson, 404 U.S. 97, 92 S.Ct. 349, 30 L.Ed.2d 296 (1971).  Those cases articulated a three-pronged analysis that seeks to minimize the \"visit[ation of] substantial injustice and hardship upon those litigants who relied\" upon a congressional statute's grant of jurisdiction.  Marathon Pipe Line, 458 U.S. at 88, 102 S.Ct. at 2880 (plurality opinion) (Brennan, J.)  (construing Huson ).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are several difficulties with the probation officers' argument.  First, the Supreme Court in recent years has largely rejected the pertinent propositions in both Marathon Pipe Line and Huson.   See Reynoldsville Casket Co. v. Hyde, 514 U.S. 749, 752, 115 S.Ct. 1745, 1748, 131 L.Ed.2d 820 (1995) (describing Huson as having been overruled in part as stated by Harper v. Virginia Dep't of Tax'n, 509 U.S. 86, 113 S.Ct. 2510, 125 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993)).  Second, subject matter jurisdiction and Eleventh Amendment immunity can be raised at any time, and when raised, the issue is not whether the court had jurisdiction at some time in the past, but whether the court today still has jurisdiction.  Thus, in a decision that postdates the two largely discredited cases on which the state employees in this dispute so heavily rely, the Supreme Court has emphasized that \" 'a court lacks discretion to consider the merits of a case over which it is without jurisdiction, and thus, by definition, a jurisdictional ruling may never be made prospective only.' \"  Budinich v. Becton Dickinson &amp; Co., 486 U.S. 196, 203, 108 S.Ct. 1717, 1722, 100 L.Ed.2d 178 (1988) (unanimous decision) (quoting Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Risjord, 449 U.S. 368, 379, 101 S.Ct. 669, 676, 66 L.Ed.2d 571 (1981)).  Finally, the probation officers' request contravenes our own recent pronouncement on this issue.  See Stella v. Kelley, 63 F.3d 71, 74 (1st Cir.1995) (\"When dealing with matters that govern a court's jurisdiction, there is no conceivable bar to retroactive application of a 'new,' judicially declared rule.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>The Denial of Plaintiffs' Discovery Request</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next consider the probation officers' argument that the district court improperly denied their request to conduct discovery on whether Maine waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity by voluntarily participating in a federal program that expressly conditions state participation upon a state's consent to suit in federal court.  We review a district court's decision to deny discovery on a dispositive motion for abuse of discretion.  See Fennell v. First Step Designs, Ltd., 83 F.3d 526, 530 (1st Cir.1996) (interpreting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The probation officers argue that a state is subject to suit in federal court where it has waived its Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity, either expressly or implicitly by participating in a federal program conditioned on a state's consent to suit in federal court.  See Atascadero State Hosp. v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 241, 105 S.Ct. 3142, 3146-47, 87 L.Ed.2d 171 (1985).  The probation officers also argue that litigants are generally afforded the right to undertake discovery when they are faced with a jurisdictional bar.  See Gould, Inc. v. Pechiney Ugine Kuhlmann, 853 F.2d 445, 451 (6th Cir.1988);  Majd-Pour v. Georgiana Community Hosp. Inc., 724 F.2d 901, 903 (11th Cir.1984) (\"Although the plaintiff bears the burden of proving the court's jurisdiction, the plaintiff should be given the opportunity to discover facts that would support his allegations of jurisdiction.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maine law authorizes the Maine Department of Corrections to receive federal funds \"to carry out federal law.\"   See Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit.  34-A, &#167;&#167; 1403(4), 1209(2)(B) &amp; (4)(F).  The probation officers contend that these statutes, even standing alone, support a finding that Maine has voluntarily subjected itself to federal court jurisdiction in lawsuits brought pursuant to the FLSA.  At the very least, they contend, they should have the opportunity to undertake discovery on Maine's participation in federal programs because the State controls the information about the federal programs in which it actually participates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In evaluating the merits of the probation officers' argument on this point, we begin by noting that \"[t]he test for determining whether a State has waived its immunity from federal-court jurisdiction is a stringent one.\"  Atascadero, 473 U.S. at 241, 105 S.Ct. at 3146.   We have had previous occasion to explain that \"a waiver must be unambiguously manifested, and because of that requirement a state's mere participation in a federal program ... has been held insufficient to demonstrate a state's waiver of its immunity.\"  WJM, Inc. v. Massachusetts Dep't of Pub. Welfare, 840 F.2d 996, 1002 (1st Cir.1988) (citing Atascadero, 473 U.S. at 244-46, 105 S.Ct. at 3148-49).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts that have considered the waiver theory have confronted plaintiffs who at least had identified some federal program or statute that supposedly required a waiver of state immunity as a condition for state participation or receipt of federal money.  Cf. Manypenny v. United States, 948 F.2d 1057, 1066-67 (8th Cir.1991) (plaintiffs identify White Earth Land Settlement Act);  Yorktown Med.  Lab., Inc. v. Perales, 948 F.2d 84, 88 (2d Cir.1991) (plaintiff identifies Boren Amendment to the Medicaid Act).  But cf.  Baxter v. Vigo County Sch. Corp., 26 F.3d 728, 731-32 (7th Cir.1994) (plaintiffs fail to name federal program or statute).  The plaintiffs in this case want to undertake discovery to identify the federal programs in which Maine participates.  In other words, Maine argues, the plaintiffs \"not only want to conduct a fishing expedition, they want to conduct discovery in order to locate the lake in which to conduct the fishing expedition.\"   We believe that this assessment, whatever else it may be, sufficiently describes the situation confronting us, and on these facts we cannot conclude, particularly given the stringent waiver standard articulated in Atascadero and WJM, that the district court abused its discretion in deciding to deny discovery on the plaintiffs' motion.  See Fennell, 83 F.3d at 530.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The State Transfer Issue</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next consider the appellants' argument that, assuming Seminole Tribe precludes federal jurisdiction in this FLSA action, the district court improperly dismissed the case rather than transfer it to state court.  Whether a district court had authority to transfer a case to a state court is a legal question we review de novo.  See Industrial Gen. Corp. v. Sequoia Pac.  Sys. Corp., 44 F.3d 40, 43 (1st Cir.1995).  Whether the district court should have exercised its authority to transfer a case to another court is a question we review for abuse of discretion.  See Service Employees Int'l Union v. Local 1199 N.E., 70 F.3d 647, 655 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The probation officers' argument is flawed in several respects.  First, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure mandate that a federal court that determines it lacks subject matter jurisdiction has only one course of action left open to it:  \"Whenever it appears by suggestion of the parties or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, the court shall dismiss the action.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(3) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the probation officers' request runs afoul of earlier pronouncements from this and other circuits.  See Dantes v. Western Found.  Corp., 614 F.2d 299, 301 (1st Cir.1980) (\" 'Where, as here, the court lacks jurisdiction over the subject matter ... [a defect] which precludes it from acting at all, a fortiori, a court lacks power to transfer.' \")  (quoting Atlantic Ship Rigging Co. v. McLellan, 288 F.2d 589, 591 (3rd Cir.1961) and citing Panhandle E. Pipe Line Co. v. FPC, 343 F.2d 905, 908 (8th Cir.1965));  Klett v. Pim, 965 F.2d 587, 591 n. 7 (8th Cir.1992) (\"[A] court without subject matter jurisdiction cannot transfer a case to another court.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the probation officers overlook 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1631, which limits a federal court's power to transfer a case \"to any other such court\" defined in 28 U.S.C. &#167; 610, which, in turn, includes only other federal courts.  See Moravian Sch. Advisory Bd. v. Rawlins, 70 F.3d 270, 274 (3d Cir.1995) (citing McLaughlin v. ARCO Polymers, Inc., 721 F.2d 426, 429 (3rd Cir.1983)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we are unpersuaded by the probation officers' reliance on a Third Circuit decision, Weaver v. Marine Bank, 683 F.2d 744 (3rd Cir.1982).  In Weaver, the Third Circuit confronted an arguably similar situation in which plaintiffs had originally filed their claim in federal court believing that the court had subject matter jurisdiction under federal securities law.  The Supreme Court subsequently ruled that the plaintiffs had no such claim.  See Marine Bank v. Weaver, 455 U.S. 551, 559, 102 S.Ct. 1220, 1225, 71 L.Ed.2d 409 (1982).  On remand, there was no other federal question upon which to base jurisdiction, diversity was lacking, and the Third Circuit faced the possibility that the plaintiffs' cause of action in state court would be time-barred.  See 683 F.2d at 745-46.   In this set of circumstances, the Third Circuit took the step of transferring the matter to state court pursuant to a Pennsylvania enabling statute.  See id. at 748.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Maine does not have a statute identical to the Pennsylvania law upon which the Third Circuit relied, but the probation officers indicate that Maine has a savings statute that permits cases to be transferred to the proper court when the original action fails \"for any matter of form.\"  Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &#167; 855.  The probation officers argue that the savings statute should be read to permit transfer of an action from a federal district court to a state court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe this argument underestimates the importance that the Third Circuit attached to the unique nature of the Pennsylvania statute on which it relied in transferring the case to state court.  The Third Circuit explained that this statute, on its face, expressed \"Pennsylvania's willingness to accept jurisdiction over cases improvidently brought in the federal courts,\" and specifically \"provide[d both] that a federal court within the state may transfer erroneously filed cases to the state courts,\" and that matters transferred under the statute's provisions \" 'shall be treated ... as if originally filed in the transferee court ... on the date first filed in a [federal] court.' \"  683 F.2d at 748, 745, 746 (quoting 42 Pa.  Cons.Stat. &#167; 5103(a)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In transferring the case, the Third Circuit explained that it had the authority to do so as a result of this specifically worded Pennsylvania statute and its \"underlying\" power as a federal court \"to elect to use such a state mechanism, if available.\"  Id. at 747.   In this regard, the Third Circuit analogized the transfer to a situation in which a federal court certifies a question of doubtful state law to a state supreme court authorized by state law to accept it, and noted that the Supreme Court had approved certification, despite a lack of federal statutory authorization for the practice, because it \" 'helps build a cooperative judicial federalism.' \"  Id. (quoting Lehman Bros. v. Schein, 416 U.S. 386, 391, 94 S.Ct. 1741, 1744, 40 L.Ed.2d 215 (1974)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Pennsylvania enabling statute that rests at the heart of Weaver bears no resemblance to the Maine general savings statute in this case from which the appellants seek succor.  See Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &#167; 855.  The Maine statute makes no mention of transfer and only permits a re-filing in state court of a case that has been \"defeated for any matter of form.\"  Id. Neither the parties' nor our own research has uncovered any Maine caselaw that addresses whether this description would encompass the case at bar as a matter of state law.  We note, however, that on our reading of the statute we glean no manifestation of a willingness on the part of the State of Maine analogous to that of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to accept jurisdiction over cases improvidently filed in federal court with relation back to the time of the filing of the case in federal court.  The importance of the Pennsylvania statute and its specialized provisions to the outcome in Weaver is evident when one considers that the Third Circuit subsequently has explicitly stated that \"[a]bsent statutory authority, the traditional general rule that a court may not transfer a matter over which it lacks jurisdiction governs.\"  Shendock v.

This motion constitutes an eleventh hour attempt by plaintiffs to bring their case under the aegis of the doctrine of Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908), and thereby overcome the Eleventh Amendment bar to their FLSA action.  For the reasons that follow, we deny the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although not the routine, appellate courts have authority to allow amendments to complaints because \" '[t]here is ... in the nature of ... appellate jurisdiction, nothing which forbids the granting of amendments.' \"  Newman-Green, Inc. v. Alfonzo-Larrain, 490 U.S. 826, 834, 109 S.Ct. 2218, 2223, 104 L.Ed.2d 893 (1989) (quoting Anonymous, 1 F. Cas. 996, 997 (C.C.Mass.1812) (No. 444) (Story, Circuit Justice)).  This feature of appellate court power \"long predates the enactment of the Federal Rules,\" and stems from common law practice, which \"permitted 'the superior court ... [to] make such amendments, as the court below may.' \"  Newman-Green, 490 U.S. at 834, 109 S.Ct. at 2223 (quoting Anonymous, 1 F. Cas. at 997) (quoting King v. Ponsonby, 1 Wils. 303, 95 Eng.  Rep. 631 (K.B.1751)).  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1653 (\"Defective allegations of jurisdiction may be amended, upon terms, in the trial or appellate courts.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff probation officers' argument in favor of their motion rests on three arguments.  The first is the amendment authorization contained in 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1653.  The second is the doctrine of Ex parte Young, which allows plaintiffs to avoid the Eleventh Amendment bar by naming a state officer in his official capacity in cases where prospective declaratory and injunctive relief is sought under federal law.  The third is the liberal standard of Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which, in relevant part, provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p>A party may amend the party's pleading once as a matter of course at any time before a responsive pleading is served....  Otherwise a party may amend the party's pleading only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party;  and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While intriguing at first glance, closer inspection reveals that the plaintiffs-appellants' argument runs aground at each juncture.  In the first place, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1653 does not allow what the probation officers seek here.  Section 1653 allows amendments to cure \"[d]efective allegations of jurisdiction.\"  (emphasis added).  This statutory language \"suggests that it addresses only incorrect statements about jurisdiction that actually exists, and not defects in the jurisdictional facts themselves.\"  Newman-Green, 490 U.S. at 831, 109 S.Ct. at 2222.   Specifically, the Newman-Green Court refused to interpret section 1653 as \"empower[ing] federal courts to amend a complaint so as to produce jurisdiction where none actually existed before.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Newman-Green Court's interpretation of section 1653 thus precludes the amendment that the probation officers desire.  The unequivocal rule of Newman-Green is that section 1653 does not authorize the addition or elimination of parties in order to create jurisdiction where jurisdiction does not exist.  See Newman-Green at 830-31, 109 S.Ct. at 2221-22.   This rule is fatal to the plaintiffs-appellants' argument because this is exactly the relief they seek in asking that their complaint be amended by adding the Commissioner of Corrections as a new party defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, we reiterate our view that, where a party has had an opportunity to seek to amend its pleadings in the district court, it is not appropriate for that party belatedly to seek leave to amend on appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1653.  See Joy, 175 F.2d at 396.   Accord Sarnoff v. American Home Prods.  Corp., 798 F.2d 1075, 1079 (7th Cir.1986).  The appellants here, like the Joy appellants, \"having refused to amend\" before the district court, \"come to this court asking leave to do what they failed to do below and attempt to create an error upon the part of the trial court because of matter never before that court.\"  Joy, 175 F.2d at 396.   After the Supreme Court handed down its decision in Seminole Tribe, and certainly after the State of Maine filed its motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based upon the ruling of Seminole Tribe, the probation officers had every reason to \"suspect[ ] a jurisdictional difficulty\" with their case, but took \"no reasonable opportunity to cure it before the appeal.\"  Sarnoff, 798 F.2d at 1079.   Under these circumstances, we believe it is only fair and reasonable to conclude that the appellants \"had fair warning in the district court and failed to act on it;  enough is enough.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the proposed amendment is a futile attempt to bring this case under the ambit of Ex parte Young.   The only relief that the plaintiffs have sought in this case, prior to the filing of their proposed amendment on appeal, has been unpaid wages and liquidated damages under the FLSA.  Ex parte Young allows a way around the bar to federal jurisdiction erected by the Supreme Court's Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence only in cases where prospective declaratory or injunctive relief is sought under federal law.  See Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1132 (\"[S]ince our decision in Ex parte Young, we often have found federal jurisdiction over a suit against a state official when that suit seeks only prospective injunctive relief in order to 'end a continuing violation of federal law.' \")  (internal citation omitted) (quoting Mansour, 474 U.S. at 68, 106 S.Ct. at 426).   The Ex parte Young doctrine does not apply in cases where plaintiffs seek monetary relief for past violations of federal law, regardless of whether the party the plaintiffs seek to designate as a defendant is nominally a state officer sued in his official capacity.  See Pennhurst State Sch. &amp; Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 102-03, 104 S.Ct. 900, 909, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984);  Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 668, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 1358, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These cases preclude the probation officers' attempt to rescue their monetary claims against the State of Maine via their proposed addition of the Commissioner of Corrections as a new party defendant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The plaintiffs-appellants nonetheless argue that just because they \"may be deprived of recovering retroactive money damages in federal court should not also mean that they are deprived of the benefit of their efforts to have their rights under [the] FLSA declared.\"   However, both sides to this dispute agree that there is no continuing violation of federal law, as the background litigation between them also indicates is the case.  See Blackie v. Maine, 75 F.3d 716 (1st Cir.1996), aff'g Blackie v. Maine, 888 F.Supp. 203 (D.Me.1995).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No declaratory relief can issue in these circumstances.  See Mansour, 474 U.S. at 71-73, 106 S.Ct. at 427-28.   The Mansour Court concluded that injunctive and declaratory relief could not issue for a variety of reasons that also exist in this case.  First, the Court in Mansour noted that monetary relief was not available because it was \"prohibited by the Eleventh Amendment.\"  Id. at 73, 106 S.Ct. at 428.   Second, the Court explained that \"[b]ecause there is no continuing violation of federal law to enjoin in this case, an injunction is not available.\"  Id. at 71, 106 S.Ct. at 427.   Third, the Court conceded that it had construed the Declaratory Judgment Act of 1934, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2201, to mean that \"declaratory relief may be available even though an injunction is not,\" but explained that it had also \"held that a declaratory judgment is not available in a number of instances.\"  Id. at 72, 106 S.Ct. at 428.   Specifically, declaratory relief was unavailable where \"the award of declaratory judgment ... would be useful in resolving the dispute over the past lawfulness of respondent's action only if it might be offered in state-court proceedings as res judicata on the issue of liability, leaving to the state courts only a form of accounting proceeding whereby damages or restitution could be computed.\"  Id. at 73, 106 S.Ct. at 428.   The Court concluded that \"the issuance of a declaratory judgment in these circumstances would have much the same effect as a full-fledged award of damages or restitution by the federal court, the latter kinds of relief being of course prohibited by the Eleventh Amendment.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In view of the marked similarity between the situation that confronted the Mansour Court and that confronts us in this case, we cannot help but note Mansour 's admonition that \"a declaratory judgment is not available when the result would be a partial 'end run' \" around the rest of the Supreme Court's Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence, particularly its limitations on the Ex parte Young doctrine.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Seminole Tribe suggests that the probation officers could not seek injunctive relief, even if there were a continuing violation in this case, because the FLSA only authorizes the Secretary of Labor to seek injunctive relief, limiting employees to suits for unpaid wages and liquidated damages.  See 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 216, 217;  cf.  Donovan v. Brown Equip. &amp; Serv.  Tools, Inc., 666 F.2d 148, 155-56 (5th Cir.1982) (reviewing legislative history).  In the face of this statutory scheme, the appellants' motion to amend their complaint is particularly suspect.  As the Supreme Court explained in Seminole Tribe, \"where Congress has prescribed a detailed remedial scheme for the enforcement against a State of a statutorily created right, a court should hesitate before casting aside those limitations and permitting an action against a state officer based upon Ex parte Young.\"  517 U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1132.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, with no right on the part of the plaintiff probation officers to seek retroactive money damages, with no continuing violation to justify injunctive relief, and with no clearly apparent right on the part of the plaintiffs to seek injunctive relief even if a continuing violation were present, declaratory relief, as in Green v. Mansour, would serve no useful purpose.  See 474 U.S. at 73, 106 S.Ct. at 428.   The only possible use of declaratory relief in this case now would be for the purpose of asserting res judicata in state court proceedings.  As we saw above, however, Mansour precludes this option as an impermissible \"end run\" around Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence because the result would be little different than a prohibited direct federal court award of money damages against the state to the extent it would reduce a state court proceeding into a mere accounting session \"whereby damages or restitution could be computed.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has identified a range of circumstances, including undue delay and futility of amendment, that should preclude granting a motion to amend.  See Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 230, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962) (construing Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a)).  Suffice to say that the panoply of legal arguments we have canvassed above indicates that the plaintiff probation officers' eleventh hour motion to amend to seek declaratory relief fails under more than one prong of the Foman standard.  In particular, a declaratory judgment is unavailable where, as here, the parties agree that there is no ongoing legal violation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In concluding, we stress that our decision today does not remove state employees from the aegis of the FLSA.  In determining that Seminole Tribe controls this case and that no federal jurisdiction exists, our decision only relates to that portion of the FLSA that purports to give federal courts jurisdiction over private FLSA actions brought by employees against states.  See 29 U.S.C. &#167; 216(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we conclude that the district court's decision to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction was correct, and we deny the plaintiffs-appellants' motion to amend their complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

See Timmer, 104 F.3d at 845-47 (Boggs, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  The dissent's author explained that he could not agree that Congress' \"exclusive invocation of only one source of power was not only unnecessary, but completely irrelevant.\"  Id. at 846.  \"If that were the case,\" he contended, \"then any such statement ... would always be mere surplusage and a court would always be free to rummage through the Constitution to find some clause that the court thinks might support the exercise of power.\"  Id. While the reasoning in the Timmer dissent has some surface appeal, we choose not to embrace it in light of the contrary Supreme Court and First Circuit precedent that we consider above.  See Wyoming, 460 U.S. at 243-44 n. 18, 103 S.Ct. at 1064 n. 18;  Woods, 333 U.S. at 144, 68 S.Ct. at 424;  Ramirez, 715 F.2d at 698</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> This case does not directly implicate the Supreme Court's recent decision in City of Boerne v.

In Boerne, the Court held that Congress' section five power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment does not encompass a substantive, nonremedial power to alter or redefine what constitutes a violation of the Constitution.  The situation that the Court confronted in Boerne does not pertain here, where what is at issue is congressional power to enact a remedial scheme for the violation of federal statutory law that includes a grant of federal jurisdiction over cases involving private plaintiffs and states not consenting to suit</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> While our subsequent decision in Reopell v.

This new development in the Court's jurisprudence is not implicated here.  Unlike Coeur d'Alene, this case does not involve an ongoing violation of federal law, but instead concerns a backwards-looking dispute over past FLSA violations by the State of Maine and possible overtime back pay owed the plaintiff probation officers as a result</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> We believe that the Sixth Circuit's view on this matter may thus be precluded by Seminole Tribe.

Maine contended that the probation officers were exempt from the FLSA's overtime provisions.  The district court concluded that the plaintiffs were covered employees but came within the FLSA's partial exemption for law enforcement officers, thus requiring additional proceedings on the scope of Maine's liability and the damages recoverable by the probation officers, if any.  Following the district court's ruling, the state brought itself into compliance with the FLSA's wage and hour requirements, but because the litigants disputed how much overtime back pay Maine owed the probation officers, the district court submitted the plaintiffs' claims and time sheets to a special master.

When determining whether congressional enactments are \"appropriate\" and valid exercises of enforcement clause powers such as the one at issue here, Supreme Court precedent indicates that we look to whether the act is a \"rational means\" to an end that is \"comprehended\" by the underlying constitutional amendment.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">676</span></span> (1879) (interpreting scope of congressional power under the enforcement clauses of the Reconstruction Amendments).  In Morgan, the Supreme Court articulated a three-pronged test for determining whether congressional legislation is enacted to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.  Specifically, the Court determined that a congressional enactment is \"appropriate legislation\" under section five for Equal Protection purposes in the following circumstances:  (1) if it \"may be regarded as an enactment to enforce the Equal Protection Clause,\" (2) if it \"is 'plainly adapted to that end,' \" and (3) if it \"is not prohibited by but is consistent with 'the letter and spirit of the constitution.' \"  Morgan, 384 U.S. at 651, 86 S.Ct. at 1724 (quoting McCulloch, 17 U.S.  (4 Wheat.) at 421).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sixth Circuit has concluded that the three Morgan factors effectively reworked the longstanding constitutional test we have outlined above by requiring something more than a rational relationship between a congressional enactment and the ends comprehended by the Fourteenth Amendment.  See Wilson-Jones, 99 F.3d at 209 (\"It is clear to us that these three ... factors cannot be kept so permissive as to make them collapse into the 'rationally related' test generally used for the enforcement clauses of other constitutional amendments.\").  What was clear to the Sixth Circuit panel is not so easy to discern because our review of Supreme Court precedent, as indicated above, convinces us that Morgan does not treat section five differently than other enforcement clauses and does not depart from the traditional formulation of such clauses' broad scope.  Were the Sixth Circuit panel correct, we would have to conclude that Morgan essentially overruled Ex parte Virginia and its progeny sub silentio.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not read Morgan to accomplish what the Sixth Circuit suggests.  See Ramirez 715 F.2d at 698 (\"The sweep of [Ex parte Virginia 's] mandate was reaffirmed in Katzenbach v. Morgan.\").   Pointing to Ex parte Virginia, the Morgan Court explained that \"congressional power under &#167; 5 ha[s] th[e] same broad scope\" as McCulloch determined Congress has under the Commerce Clause, as South Carolina v. Katzenbach determined Congress has under section two of the Fifteenth Amendment, see 383 U.S. at 326, 86 S.Ct. at 817-18, and as James Everard's Breweries, see 265 U.S. at 558-59, 44 S.Ct. at 631, determined Congress had under the enforcement clause of the now-repealed Eighteenth Amendment.  See Morgan 384 U.S. at 650-51, 86 S.Ct. at 1723-24 (discussing cases).  On our reading of the case, we cannot agree with the Sixth Circuit that a rearticulated and heightened Fourteenth Amendment standard now applies by virtue of Morgan.   We thus see no reason to doubt the correctness of our decision in Ramirez regarding Morgan and the rational basis standard enunciated therein, which we reaffirm as controlling in this circuit.  See 715 F.2d at 698.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The scope of the rational basis test, however, requires some clarification.  The Sixth Circuit defends its rearticulated Fourteenth Amendment standard by highlighting the unacceptable consequences that it believes would be attendant upon retaining the rational basis standard.  See Wilson-Jones, 99 F.3d at 209 (\"If we were to say that an act is valid if it is rationally related to achieving equal protection of the laws, then &#167; 5 becomes a license to Congress to pass any sort of legislation whatsoever.\").  We do not agree that the rational basis test regarding enforcement of the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection guaranty gives Congress a license to pass any sort of legislation whatsoever.

Similarly, every congressional action that enlargens the scope of a law to encompass a new class of people--thereby eliminating a previous 'discrimination' that the law had made--is not, ipso facto, a means towards enforcing section five of the Fourteenth Amendment, because that provision does not \"permit Congress to prohibit every discrimination between groups of people.\"  Id.

To be a legitimate expression of Congress' section five power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment, therefore, the 1974 amendments at issue in this case, which extended the FLSA's wage and hour provisions to states and state employees, have to be \"rational means\" towards the end \"comprehended\" in this context by the Equal Protection Clause, South Carolina, 383 U.S. at 324, 326, 86 S.Ct. at 816, 817-18, namely, the guaranty against \"irrational,\" and therefore \"unjustified,\" government action.  Ramirez, 715 F.2d at 699.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevant Supreme Court precedents we have considered above indicate that Congress, when acting pursuant to section five of the Fourteenth Amendment, can prohibit or take measures designed to remedy unreasonable and arbitrary classifications made by states, or the effects of such classifications, and when doing so can, consistent with Seminole Tribe, abrogate the states' sovereign immunity to suit in federal court.  Conversely, these precedents indicate that Congress' section five enforcement power, as it pertains to the Equal Protection Clause in cases not involving suspect or quasi-suspect classes or fundamental interests, is limited to the elimination of arbitrariness or the effects of arbitrary government action, and does not permit Congress to prohibit or otherwise target reasonable state decisions or practices.  We believe that this limitation on Congress' power to enforce the Equal Protection Clause follows from the end that the Clause comprehends in this specific context and the corollary fact that the Fourteenth Amendment does not render \"every discrimination between groups of people a constitutional denial of equal protection.\"  Mitchell, 400 U.S. at 127, 91 S.Ct. at 266 (opinion of Black, J.).  To reiterate, the cases discussed above indicate that every congressional action that enlargens the scope of a law to encompass a new class of people--thereby eliminating a previous 'discrimination' that the law had made--is not, ipso facto, a means of enforcing the Fourteenth Amendment because section five does not \"permit Congress to prohibit every discrimination between groups of people.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We evaluate the FLSA amendments at issue against this framework to determine whether, in addition to being enactments made pursuant to Congress' Commerce Clause powers, they can be viewed appropriately as legislation that enforces the Equal Protection Clause.  In our estimation, one would be hard-pressed to conclude that the FLSA amendments at issue here are rationally related to eliminating any arbitrary or unreasonable state action.  Differences in the manner, method, and amount of payment that private sector and state employees receive, to the extent they exist, usually flow from a myriad of factors, including state budgetary concerns and the levels of public expenditure and taxation deemed proper by normal political processes.  However, nothing in the record indicates that anything arbitrary or irrational explains or characterizes the states' practices in this area to the extent they may be prejudicial to state employees.  Nor do we think, as the plaintiff probation officers would have us believe, that state employees and private sector employees are so similarly situated that differences in how and when they accrue premium pay for overtime violates the Equal Protection Clause's requirement that \" 'no person or class of persons shall be denied the same protection of the laws which is enjoyed by other persons or other classes in the same place and under like circumstances.' \"  Walsh, 618 F.2d at 158 (emphasis added) (quoting Lewis, 101 U.S. at 31);  see, e.g., Employees, 411 U.S. at 286, 93 S.Ct. at 1618 (noting the significant difference between private employers and states as employers owing to federalism concerns).  Accordingly, we conclude that we will not \"attribute to Congress an unstated intent to act under its authority to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment,\" Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at 16, 101 S.Ct. at 1539, because on the record before us there is no evidence that the 1974 FLSA amendments are rationally related to the elimination of any unreasonable and arbitrary state action, or the effects of such action, which Congress is empowered to remedy pursuant to section five of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Thus, we do not believe that Congress can, consistent with Seminole Tribe and Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, abrogate the states' sovereign immunity to suit in federal court in this context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In arriving at this conclusion, our analysis does not suggest any reason or need for us to revisit our earlier pronouncements regarding the FLSA wage and hour provisions at issue here.  Specifically, we have previously determined that Congress' \"authority\" to impose on the states the FLSA's wage and hour requirements was \"squarely bottomed on the commerce clause.\"  New Hampshire Dep't of Employment Sec. v. Marshall, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"375384\"><a href=\"/opinion/375384/state-of-new-hampshire-department-of-employment-security-v-the-honorable/\"><span class=\"volume\">616</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">240</span></a></span>, 247 (1st Cir.1980).  In so doing, we indicated that the FLSA provisions at issue here differed from other congressional legislation, like the Equal Pay Act, which, we explained, was applied \"to the states as a legitimate exercise of congressional authority to adopt legislation enforcing the fourteenth amendment's guaranty of equal protection of the law.\"  Id. (citing Usery v. Charleston County Sch.

Today we state the corollary that we did not explicitly state in so many words in Marshall:  whatever constitutional basis they may have in the Commerce Clause, the 1974 amendments to the FLSA in dispute again here did not apply the Act's wage and hour provisions to the states and state employees as a legitimate exercise of congressional authority to adopt legislation under section five of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion, of course, is fatal to the plaintiff probation officers' argument on appeal because in Seminole Tribe, see 517 U.S. at ---- - ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1131-32, the Supreme Court held that Congress cannot exercise its Commerce Clause power, or any of its other Article I powers, to abrogate a state's Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in federal court, thereby overruling the contrary rule of Union Gas.

First, the Supreme Court in recent years has largely rejected the pertinent propositions in both Marathon Pipe Line and Huson.   See Reynoldsville Casket Co. v.

Second, subject matter jurisdiction and Eleventh Amendment immunity can be raised at any time, and when raised, the issue is not whether the court had jurisdiction at some time in the past, but whether the court today still has jurisdiction.  Thus, in a decision that postdates the two largely discredited cases on which the state employees in this dispute so heavily rely, the Supreme Court has emphasized that \" 'a court lacks discretion to consider the merits of a case over which it is without jurisdiction, and thus, by definition, a jurisdictional ruling may never be made prospective only.' \"  Budinich v.

The plaintiffs in this case want to undertake discovery to identify the federal programs in which Maine participates.  In other words, Maine argues, the plaintiffs \"not only want to conduct a fishing expedition, they want to conduct discovery in order to locate the lake in which to conduct the fishing expedition.\"   We believe that this assessment, whatever else it may be, sufficiently describes the situation confronting us, and on these facts we cannot conclude, particularly given the stringent waiver standard articulated in Atascadero and WJM, that the district court abused its discretion in deciding to deny discovery on the plaintiffs' motion.

In Weaver, the Third Circuit confronted an arguably similar situation in which plaintiffs had originally filed their claim in federal court believing that the court had subject matter jurisdiction under federal securities law.  The Supreme Court subsequently ruled that the plaintiffs had no such claim.  See Marine Bank v.

On remand, there was no other federal question upon which to base jurisdiction, diversity was lacking, and the Third Circuit faced the possibility that the plaintiffs' cause of action in state court would be time-barred.  See 683 F.2d at 745-46.   In this set of circumstances, the Third Circuit took the step of transferring the matter to state court pursuant to a Pennsylvania enabling statute.

The Third Circuit explained that this statute, on its face, expressed \"Pennsylvania's willingness to accept jurisdiction over cases improvidently brought in the federal courts,\" and specifically \"provide[d both] that a federal court within the state may transfer erroneously filed cases to the state courts,\" and that matters transferred under the statute's provisions \" 'shall be treated ... as if originally filed in the transferee court ... on the date first filed in a [federal] court.' \"  683 F.2d at 748, 745, 746 (quoting 42 Pa.

In this regard, the Third Circuit analogized the transfer to a situation in which a federal court certifies a question of doubtful state law to a state supreme court authorized by state law to accept it, and noted that the Supreme Court had approved certification, despite a lack of federal statutory authorization for the practice, because it \" 'helps build a cooperative judicial federalism.' \"  Id.

Neither the parties' nor our own research has uncovered any Maine caselaw that addresses whether this description would encompass the case at bar as a matter of state law.  We note, however, that on our reading of the statute we glean no manifestation of a willingness on the part of the State of Maine analogous to that of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to accept jurisdiction over cases improvidently filed in federal court with relation back to the time of the filing of the case in federal court.  The importance of the Pennsylvania statute and its specialized provisions to the outcome in Weaver is evident when one considers that the Third Circuit subsequently has explicitly stated that \"[a]bsent statutory authority, the traditional general rule that a court may not transfer a matter over which it lacks jurisdiction governs.\"  Shendock v.

The first is the amendment authorization contained in 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1653.  The second is the doctrine of Ex parte Young, which allows plaintiffs to avoid the Eleventh Amendment bar by naming a state officer in his official capacity in cases where prospective declaratory and injunctive relief is sought under federal law.  The third is the liberal standard of Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which, in relevant part, provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p>A party may amend the party's pleading once as a matter of course at any time before a responsive pleading is served....  Otherwise a party may amend the party's pleading only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party;  and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While intriguing at first glance, closer inspection reveals that the plaintiffs-appellants' argument runs aground at each juncture.  In the first place, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1653 does not allow what the probation officers seek here.  Section 1653 allows amendments to cure \"[d]efective allegations of jurisdiction.\"  (emphasis added).  This statutory language \"suggests that it addresses only incorrect statements about jurisdiction that actually exists, and not defects in the jurisdictional facts themselves.\"  Newman-Green, 490 U.S. at 831, 109 S.Ct. at 2222.   Specifically, the Newman-Green Court refused to interpret section 1653 as \"empower[ing] federal courts to amend a complaint so as to produce jurisdiction where none actually existed before.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Newman-Green Court's interpretation of section 1653 thus precludes the amendment that the probation officers desire.  The unequivocal rule of Newman-Green is that section 1653 does not authorize the addition or elimination of parties in order to create jurisdiction where jurisdiction does not exist.  See Newman-Green at 830-31, 109 S.Ct. at 2221-22.   This rule is fatal to the plaintiffs-appellants' argument because this is exactly the relief they seek in asking that their complaint be amended by adding the Commissioner of Corrections as a new party defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, we reiterate our view that, where a party has had an opportunity to seek to amend its pleadings in the district court, it is not appropriate for that party belatedly to seek leave to amend on appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1653.  See Joy, 175 F.2d at 396.   Accord Sarnoff v. American Home Prods.  Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"474881\"><a href=\"/opinion/474881/norton-sarnoff-and-carl-fletcher-and-v-american-home-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">798</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1075</span></a></span>, 1079 (7th Cir.1986).  The appellants here, like the Joy appellants, \"having refused to amend\" before the district court, \"come to this court asking leave to do what they failed to do below and attempt to create an error upon the part of the trial court because of matter never before that court.\"  Joy, 175 F.2d at 396.   After the Supreme Court handed down its decision in Seminole Tribe, and certainly after the State of Maine filed its motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based upon the ruling of Seminole Tribe, the probation officers had every reason to \"suspect[ ] a jurisdictional difficulty\" with their case, but took \"no reasonable opportunity to cure it before the appeal.\"  Sarnoff, 798 F.2d at 1079.   Under these circumstances, we believe it is only fair and reasonable to conclude that the appellants \"had fair warning in the district court and failed to act on it;  enough is enough.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the proposed amendment is a futile attempt to bring this case under the ambit of Ex parte Young.   The only relief that the plaintiffs have sought in this case, prior to the filing of their proposed amendment on appeal, has been unpaid wages and liquidated damages under the FLSA.  Ex parte Young allows a way around the bar to federal jurisdiction erected by the Supreme Court's Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence only in cases where prospective declaratory or injunctive relief is sought under federal law.  See Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1132 (\"[S]ince our decision in Ex parte Young, we often have found federal jurisdiction over a suit against a state official when that suit seeks only prospective injunctive relief in order to 'end a continuing violation of federal law.' \")  (internal citation omitted) (quoting Mansour, 474 U.S. at 68, 106 S.Ct. at 426).   The Ex parte Young doctrine does not apply in cases where plaintiffs seek monetary relief for past violations of federal law, regardless of whether the party the plaintiffs seek to designate as a defendant is nominally a state officer sued in his official capacity.

Third, the Court conceded that it had construed the Declaratory Judgment Act of 1934, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2201, to mean that \"declaratory relief may be available even though an injunction is not,\" but explained that it had also \"held that a declaratory judgment is not available in a number of instances.\"  Id. at 72, 106 S.Ct. at 428.   Specifically, declaratory relief was unavailable where \"the award of declaratory judgment ... would be useful in resolving the dispute over the past lawfulness of respondent's action only if it might be offered in state-court proceedings as res judicata on the issue of liability, leaving to the state courts only a form of accounting proceeding whereby damages or restitution could be computed.\"  Id. at 73, 106 S.Ct. at 428.   The Court concluded that \"the issuance of a declaratory judgment in these circumstances would have much the same effect as a full-fledged award of damages or restitution by the federal court, the latter kinds of relief being of course prohibited by the Eleventh Amendment.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In view of the marked similarity between the situation that confronted the Mansour Court and that confronts us in this case, we cannot help but note Mansour 's admonition that \"a declaratory judgment is not available when the result would be a partial 'end run' \" around the rest of the Supreme Court's Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence, particularly its limitations on the Ex parte Young doctrine.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Seminole Tribe suggests that the probation officers could not seek injunctive relief, even if there were a continuing violation in this case, because the FLSA only authorizes the Secretary of Labor to seek injunctive relief, limiting employees to suits for unpaid wages and liquidated damages.  See 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 216, 217;  cf.  Donovan v. Brown Equip. &amp; Serv.  Tools, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"397883\"><a href=\"/opinion/397883/raymond-j-donovan-secretary-of-labor-united-states-department-of-labor/\"><span class=\"volume\">666</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span>, 155-56 (5th Cir.1982) (reviewing legislative history).  In the face of this statutory scheme, the appellants' motion to amend their complaint is particularly suspect.  As the Supreme Court explained in Seminole Tribe, \"where Congress has prescribed a detailed remedial scheme for the enforcement against a State of a statutorily created right, a court should hesitate before casting aside those limitations and permitting an action against a state officer based upon Ex parte Young.\"  517 U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1132.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, with no right on the part of the plaintiff probation officers to seek retroactive money damages, with no continuing violation to justify injunctive relief, and with no clearly apparent right on the part of the plaintiffs to seek injunctive relief even if a continuing violation were present, declaratory relief, as in Green v. Mansour, would serve no useful purpose.  See 474 U.S. at 73, 106 S.Ct. at 428.   The only possible use of declaratory relief in this case now would be for the purpose of asserting res judicata in state court proceedings.  As we saw above, however, Mansour precludes this option as an impermissible \"end run\" around Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence because the result would be little different than a prohibited direct federal court award of money damages against the state to the extent it would reduce a state court proceeding into a mere accounting session \"whereby damages or restitution could be computed.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has identified a range of circumstances, including undue delay and futility of amendment, that should preclude granting a motion to amend.  See Foman v. Davis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106497\"><a href=\"/opinion/106497/foman-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">371</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">178</span></a></span>, 182, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106497\"><a href=\"/opinion/106497/foman-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">222</span></a></span> (1962) (construing Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a)).  Suffice to say that the panoply of legal arguments we have canvassed above indicates that the plaintiff probation officers' eleventh hour motion to amend to seek declaratory relief fails under more than one prong of the Foman standard.  In particular, a declaratory judgment is unavailable where, as here, the parties agree that there is no ongoing legal violation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In concluding, we stress that our decision today does not remove state employees from the aegis of the FLSA.  In determining that Seminole Tribe controls this case and that no federal jurisdiction exists, our decision only relates to that portion of the FLSA that purports to give federal courts jurisdiction over private FLSA actions brought by employees against states.  See 29 U.S.C. &#167; 216(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we conclude that the district court's decision to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction was correct, and we deny the plaintiffs-appellants' motion to amend their complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

See Timmer, 104 F.3d at 845-47 (Boggs, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  The dissent's author explained that he could not agree that Congress' \"exclusive invocation of only one source of power was not only unnecessary, but completely irrelevant.\"  Id. at 846.  \"If that were the case,\" he contended, \"then any such statement ... would always be mere surplusage and a court would always be free to rummage through the Constitution to find some clause that the court thinks might support the exercise of power.\"  Id. While the reasoning in the Timmer dissent has some surface appeal, we choose not to embrace it in light of the contrary Supreme Court and First Circuit precedent that we consider above.  See Wyoming, 460 U.S. at 243-44 n. 18, 103 S.Ct. at 1064 n. 18;  Woods, 333 U.S. at 144, 68 S.Ct. at 424;  Ramirez, 715 F.2d at 698</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> This case does not directly implicate the Supreme Court's recent decision in City of Boerne v.

In Boerne, the Court held that Congress' section five power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment does not encompass a substantive, nonremedial power to alter or redefine what constitutes a violation of the Constitution.

This new development in the Court's jurisprudence is not implicated here.
