On appeal defendant-\r\nappellant Murad Skin Research Laboratories, Inc. (\"Murad\")\r\nchallenges the verdict rendered in favor of both plaintiffs IRG\r\nRESEARCH GROUP, INC. (\"IRG\") and Ileana Irvine (\"Irvine\").\r\nSpecifically, Murad alleges that the district court erred by (1)\r\nnot granting its motion for judgment as a matter of law; (2)\r\ndeclining to charge the jury in accordance with its proffered\r\ninstruction on foreseeability; (3) denying its petition for a new\r\ntrial; and (4) allowing the testimony of plaintiffs' expert\r\nwitness.\r\nOn review we agree with Murad's reasoning that both\r\ncauses of action should have been dismissed as a matter of law. \r\nAccordingly, there is no need to address the other issues raised by\r\nMurad.\r\n                          BACKGROUND\r\nMurad is a stateside manufacturer of skin care products. \r\nIrvine and her daughter, Catherine Irvine Sarnataro, both\r\n\"aestheticians,\" i.e. skin care specialists, first came in contact\r\nwith the Murad line of products at a trade show in Chicago in 1989. \r\nIrvine testified at trial that there was a \"glycolic acid\r\nrevolution\" in the industry at the time and she found the glycolic\r\nacid manufactured by Murad to be the \"most effective\" of all the\r\nother products available in the market.  Initially, she purchased\r\nMurad products for her own clients but since 1991 she also sold\r\nthem to various salons.  Subsequently, Irvine and her daughter met periodically\r\nwith Dr. Howard Murad, president of Murad, at various conferences\r\nand conveyed to him an interest in becoming the exclusive\r\ndistributor of Murad products in Puerto Rico.  The conversations\r\nculminated in a provisional exclusive distribution agreement dated\r\nSeptember 2, 1993 with IRG, a corporation established and\r\ncontrolled by Irvine and her daughter.  The contract would be\r\nextended thereafter conditioned upon IRG meeting certain sales\r\nquotas.\r\nBoth Irvine and her daughter testified regarding their\r\nefforts on behalf of IRG to develop a market for the Murad skin\r\nproducts in Puerto Rico which included promotions, advertisements,\r\ndemonstrations, training and education of both aestheticians and\r\ndermatologists.  IRG operated through its own clinics and also sold\r\nto aestheticians and medical offices.\r\nIn May 1994 Murad broadcast an infomercial on various\r\nstateside cable television stations as part of its advertising\r\ncampaign.  Dr. Murad testified that the purpose behind the\r\ninfomercial was to expose their home products to customers and also\r\nto lure them into the salons for professional treatment.  Unbeknown\r\nto Murad, a New York station relayed the infomercial to Puerto Rico\r\nand its products were thereby made available locally through\r\ntelemarketing.\r\nAccording to plaintiffs-appellees, the infomercial marked\r\nthe beginning of the economic downfall of both IRG and Irvine. \r\nAfter IRG learned of the telemarketing incursion, it sought relief\r\nunder the Puerto Rico Distributorship Act, Law 75 of June 24, 1964,\r\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10,  278 et seq. (1997) whereas Irvine sued\r\nunder the local torts statute.  The jury found for plaintiffs-\r\nappellees and awarded $390,000 to IRG and $100,000 to Irvine as\r\ndamages.\r\n                           RULE 50\r\nPetitions for judgments as a matter of law under Rule\r\n50(a)(1) Fed. R. Civ. P. will be granted only in those instances\r\nwhere, after having examined the evidence as well as all\r\npermissible inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable\r\nto non-movant, the court finds that a reasonable jury could not\r\nrender a verdict in that party's favor.

LAW 75\r\n                          Generally\r\nPuerto Rico's Law 75 governs the business relationship\r\nbetween principals and the locally appointed distributors/dealers\r\nfor marketing their products.  The statute was initially enacted to\r\navoid the inequity of arbitrary termination of distribution\r\nrelationships once the designated dealer had successfully developed\r\na local market for the principal's products and/or services. \r\nEuromotion, Inc. v. BMW of N. Am., Inc., 136 F.3d 866, 870 (1st\r\nCir. 1998); Borschow Hosp. and Med. Supplies, Inc. v. Csar\r\nCastillo, Inc., 96 F.3d 10, 14 (1st Cir. 1996); R.W. Intern. Corp.\r\nv. Welch Foods, Inc., 88 F.3d 49, 51 (1st Cir. 1996).  In order to\r\naccomplish its goal Law 75 limited the principal's ability to end\r\nthe relationship unilaterally except for \"just cause,\"  278a,\r\nwhile subjecting the principal to  considerable economic liability\r\nfor terminations without just cause.  See  278b of Law 75\r\n(enumerating factors to consider in calculating award).\r\nIn 1966 the protection afforded to dealers under Law 75\r\nwas extended to include the conduct of a principal which even\r\nthough it did not end the contract it was deemed detrimental to\r\nthe distribution relationship.  The amendment further provided that\r\nimpairments without just cause would subject the infringing party\r\nto the same liability provided for terminations under  278b. \r\n                          Impairment\r\nLaw 75 enumerates some instances of impairment by way of\r\nillustration and establishes a rebuttable presumption of\r\nimpairment whenever a principal bypasses a dealer by distributing\r\nmerchandise directly; appoints additional dealers in contravention\r\nof the agreement; fails to adequately fill orders; or arbitrarily\r\nchanges the transportation and/or payment terms.   278a-1(b)(1)-\r\n(4).\r\nThe protection afforded dealers by Law 75, however, is\r\ncircumscribed by those rights acquired under the agreement\r\nregulating their business relationship.  Therefore, whether or not\r\nan impairment has taken place will depend upon the specific terms\r\nof the distribution contract.\r\n    The question whether there has been a\r\n\"detriment\" to the existing relationship\r\nbetween supplier and dealer is just another\r\nway of asking whether the terms of the\r\ncontract existing between the parties have\r\nbeen impaired.\r\n\nVulcan Tools of P.R. v. Makita USA, Inc., 23 F.3d 564, 569 (1st\r\nCir. 1994).\r\nThe parties do not dispute the fact that, pursuant to the\r\nSeptember 2, 1993 agreement, IRG had the exclusive distribution\r\nrights of Murad products in Puerto Rico during a trial period\r\nlasting from August 25, 1993 through December 31, 1994.  Further,\r\nthe document provided that should IRG meet a particular sales quota\r\nit would qualify to act as Murad's exclusive distributor for an\r\nadditional two years.\r\nIt is also uncontested that through its infomercial,\r\nwhich commenced airing in Puerto Rico in May 1994, Murad sold its\r\nproducts directly to local clientele.  The uncontroverted evidence\r\nat trial also established that Murad never intended the broadcast\r\nto be aired in Puerto Rico.  This was a fortuitous event brought\r\nabout by cable carriers not related to Murad in any way.\r\nMurad argues that it is not liable for impairment of the\r\nrelationship because once notified by plaintiffs-appellees of the\r\nbroadcast in Puerto Rico it promptly gave instructions for this\r\nsales mode to be discontinued.\r\nA principal may not be held accountable for unknown\r\nmarket interference by third parties.  However, once put on notice\r\nthat its products are reaching an area of limited distribution\r\nrights a principal has the obligation to take prompt positive\r\naction to curtail the practice.  Even though its role was not to\r\n\"stand as a vigilant dog\", Gen. Office Prod. Corp. v. Gussco Mfg.,\r\nInc., 666 F. Supp. 328, 333 (D.P.R. 1987), once informed of the\r\nlocal transmission Murad did have an affirmative duty to ensure\r\nthat the direct sales would cease and avoid further interference\r\nwith the Puerto Rico market.\r\nMurad argues that it was alerted to the local\r\ntransmission of the broadcast \"for the first time\" via a letter\r\ndated October 14, 1994 forwarded by Catherine Irvine (Appellant's\r\nbrief at 6) and that it immediately responded by taking steps to\r\navoid its recurrence.  However, there is enough information in the\r\nrecord from which a reasonable jury could infer that Murad was\r\nadvised of the broadcast much earlier than October 14, 1994.\r\nAt trial Dr. Murad acknowledged having been informed of\r\nthe broadcast matter \"a few weeks before\" receiving the October 14,\r\n1994 letter.  Further, this correspondence makes reference to a\r\nrequest made by IRG \"[a]bout a month ago\" for a list of local\r\ncustomers who had placed orders through the infomercial which\r\npresupposes Murad had been notified of this practice long before\r\nthe letter was mailed.  The letter also points to an earlier\r\ntelephone call by Gerard Sarnataro, Catherine Irvine's husband, on\r\nbehalf of IRG \"several days ago\" notifying of direct orders placed\r\nby him and others.  Lastly, the letter was a follow-up to a prior\r\nconversation between Catherine Irvine and Dr. Murad demanding some\r\nkind of response from Murad which again proves earlier contacts\r\nregarding the prohibited availability of Murad products through the\r\ninfomercial.\r\nIrvine also testified that she, her daughter and son-in-\r\nlaw  \"started feeling the negative effects\" of the infomercial in\r\nthe summer of 1994.  She related how  customers and beauty salon\r\nowners complained to her that the products were being made\r\navailable through the television at lower prices.  Irvine further\r\nindicated that she, her daughter and her son-in-law \"immediately\r\ngot in touch with Mr. Angelo Fiorita,\" Murad's representative, to\r\nexpress their concern (emphasis ours) and that Mr. Fiorita\r\nresponded that he would \"speak with Dr. Murad and ... take the\r\nnecessary steps for this to stop happening.\"  However, according to\r\nIrvine's testimony, \"[n]othing happened.\"  Irvine explained that\r\nthe October 1994 letter was eventually sent to Murad because the\r\nsituation continued to worsen without any corrective measures being\r\ntaken by Murad.\r\nGerard Sarnataro testified that he placed orders from\r\nPuerto Rico \"several times to test out\" how long Murad would\r\ncontinue the practice of selling the products directly in the local\r\nmarket.  Mr. Sarnataro further indicated that he continued\r\npurchasing products from Puerto Rico and calling Murad to object to\r\nwhat he considered an unauthorized practice.  At trial\r\nMr. Sarnataro also described how, despite his complaints,\r\napproximately two months later he had been approached over the\r\ntelephone to inquire if he was interested in reordering Murad's\r\nproducts.\r\nMurad's first remedial action was taken on October 25,\r\n1994.  Because the jury could logically infer that Murad was put\r\non notice of the interference soon after May 1994 Murad's argument\r\nthat it responded diligently is undermined by the evidence in the\r\nrecord.  Therefore, a reasonable fact finder could have found that\r\nthe exclusive distribution provision of the contract had been\r\nimpaired by Murad's failure to take prompt positive action in\r\nreacting to IRG's complaints.  However, our analysis under Law 75\r\ndoes not conclude here.\r\n                           Damages\r\nThe jury awarded IRG $390,000 as damages under Law 75. \r\nThe statute establishes a formula for the indemnification of\r\ndealers/distributors in the event of either termination or\r\nimpairment to the relationship by a principal without just cause. \r\nHowever, Law 75 specifically limits payment \"to the extent of the\r\ndamages caused [the dealer/distributor]\"  278b (emphasis ours). \r\nIt is clear from reading this provision that damages will not be\r\nautomatically conferred in all cases of termination and/or\r\nimpairment.  In this regard the Puerto Rico Supreme Court\r\nspecifically held in Marina Indus. Inc. v. Brown Boveri Corp., 114\r\nD.P.R. 64, 90 (1983) that the factors enumerated in  278b are not\r\nmandatory.  Rather, they constitute guidelines to be utilized\r\ncontingent upon the presentation of adequate proof in each case. \r\nFurther, in Marina Industrial the Supreme Court acknowledged that\r\nevidence of damages is an essential element of a Law 75 violation\r\nas to which plaintiff bears the burden of proof.  Therefore, in\r\norder to prevail, a Law 75 plaintiff must submit evidence of\r\ndamages as part of its action.\r\n    A claim for impermissible termination\r\nor impairment of a dealership contract under\r\nsection 278 has two essential elements; that\r\nthe contract existing between the parties was\r\nimpaired or terminated without just cause and\r\nthat there were resulting damages.  After the\r\nplaintiff has shown an impairment or\r\ntermination of the contract, the defendant may\r\noffer the affirmative defense of just cause. \r\nIf there was no just cause, the plaintiff must\r\nshow damages.\r\n\nDraft-Line Corp. v. Hon Co., 781 F. Supp. 841, 843 (D.P.R. 1991)\r\naff'd, 983 F.2d 1046 (1st Cir. 1993) (unpublished table decision).\r\nThe evidence presented at trial to justify damages to IRG\r\nconsisted of the testimony of Irvine as well as the opinion of\r\nRadams Alvarez Menndez, an accountant.  According to Irvine, as\r\na result of the infomercial IRG \"sales began to decline\r\ndramatically\" in August-September 1994.  The \"business began\r\ncollapsing little by little... and in the end the business\r\nvirtually came apart.\"  However, the invoices of Murad products\r\nsold to IRG during 1994 through April 1995 directly belie this\r\ntestimony as well as the conclusions reached by the expert\r\nwitness.\r\nThe opinion rendered by plaintiffs' expert to justify\r\nIRG's damages was based on a formula using the ratio between the\r\nnumber of clinics opened by IRG and the corresponding volume of\r\nsales.  The expert then proceeded to make a projection of the\r\nanticipated sales of IRG had it opened 25 clinics within a term of\r\nfive years as originally planned.  However, the revenues employed\r\nas a basis for this computation were based on the total sales of\r\nIRG for the fiscal year running from July 1, 1993 through June 30,\r\n1994 without any reference to the sale of Murad products in\r\nparticular.  Mr. Alvarez Menndez assumed that all sales and\r\nservices provided by IRG for that period of time were exclusively\r\nMurad products which was not the case.  When confronted with the\r\nincrease of orders of Murad products throughout 1994 the expert\r\nconceded that this was \"not consistent\" with the overall decline of\r\nsales by IRG for the same period. \r\nMore significantly, according to Mr. Alvarez Menndez the\r\ndrop in sales and closing down of clinics commenced \"after the\r\nsecond quarter of 1994 [that is, October through December of 1993]\"\r\nwhich confirms that the downward trend began prior to May 1994, the\r\nonset of the alleged impairment by Murad.\r\nInasmuch as plaintiffs did not challenge in any way the\r\nauthenticity of Murad's invoices and/or the veracity of the\r\ninformation contained therein the amount of IRG sales for this\r\nperiod is conclusive on this matter.  Further, if indeed IRG's\r\npurchases of Murad products remained unaltered despite the brief\r\nperiod of Murad's direct sales in Puerto Rico IRG could not\r\nreasonably argue that it had been injured by Murad even if Murad\r\nhad breached the exclusivity clause of their  distribution\r\nagreement.  Given this uncontested factual scenario a reasonable\r\njury could not plausibly conclude that the damages complained of by\r\nIRG arose as a result of the principal's alleged impairment. IRG's\r\nLaw 75 claim must fail for  having failed to establish a causal\r\nconnection between its economic downfall and Murad's forbidden\r\ninfomercial.  Accordingly, IRG's cause of action should have been\r\nDISMISSED.\r\n                       INDIVIDUAL CLAIM\r\nThe jury awarded Ileana Irvine $100,000 as damages for\r\nher pain and suffering and loss of reputation due to Murad's\r\nnegligent actions regarding the infomercial.\r\nMurad contends that Irvine has no personal cause of\r\naction and that there was no evidence of a causal relationship\r\nbetween its \"purchase of air time for the infomercial at a New York\r\ntelevision station\" and Irvine's purported damages (Appellants'\r\nBrief at 28).\r\nIn this jurisdiction tort liability is governed by art.\r\n1802 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31,  5141\r\n(1990) which imposes responsibility for damages caused by\r\nnegligence or fault.  The necessary elements to prevail in a tort\r\naction are: (1) a negligent act or omission, (2) damages and (3) a\r\ncausal relationship between them.  De-Jess-Adorno v. Browning\r\nFerris Indus. of P.R., Inc., 160 F.3d 839, 842 (1st Cir. 1998);\r\nMarshall v. Prez-Arzuaga, 828 F.2d 845, 847 (1st Cir. 1987);\r\nMontalvo-Feliciano v.

E.L.A., 142 D.P.R.     , 97 JTS\r\n18 at 627 (1997).\r\nNot all actions or omissions which result in\r\ninjuries/damages will give rise to liability under art. 1802. \r\n\"Negligence has been defined by the Commonwealth courts as the\r\nfailure to exercise due diligence to avoid foreseeable risks.\" \r\nMalav-Flix, 946 F.2d at 971.  Therefore, liability will only\r\narise if the damages complained of were reasonably foreseeable to\r\nthe defendant.

The duty of care imposed upon a tortfeasor is\r\nanticipating reasonably probable injuries to probable victims. \r\nMarshall v. Prez-Arzuaga, 828 F.2d 847.  See Herminio M. Brau, Los\r\nDaos y Perjuicios Extracontractuales en Puerto Rico  7.02[2] at\r\n184-5 (2d ed. 1986).  The foreseeability contemplated by the\r\nstatute does not include every conceivable consequence of an act or\r\nomission since to do so would make the defendant an absolute\r\ninsurer.  See  Montalvo-Feliciano, 144 D.P.R.     , 98 JTS at 499;\r\nPacheco v. A.F.F., 112 D.P.R. 296, 300 (1982); Jimnez v.\r\nPelegrina-Espinet, 112 D.P.R. 700, 704 (1982).\r\nFor purposes of our analysis we will assume that the\r\nconduct complained of by Irvine in support of her negligence claim\r\nis the same utilized by IRG for its Law 75 action, i.e., allowing\r\nthe Murad products to be sold directly in Puerto Rico.\r\nInasmuch as our review of the claim is limited by the\r\nconstraints of a Rule 50 motion, the issue then becomes whether\r\nthere is sufficiently reliable evidence in the record for a jury to\r\nconclude that the mental anguish and loss of reputation averred by\r\nIrvine were reasonably to be foreseen to Murad as a probable\r\nconsequence of the infomercial.  In other words whether, based on\r\nthe facts presented at trial as well as the permissible inferences\r\nderived therefrom, it was reasonable for the trier of fact to find\r\nthat Murad should have anticipated the resulting damages to Irvine\r\nindividually.  As previously mentioned, there is no actionable\r\nclaim under art. 1802 if the particular injury/damage complained of\r\nby Irvine could not have been reasonably foreseen by Murad.\r\nEven though Irvine described in detail the alleged\r\ninjuries to her reputation, humiliation and pain and suffering\r\ncaused by Murad's airing of the infomercial in Puerto Rico,\r\nliability based on art. 1802 cannot rest on the existence of an\r\ninjury alone.  Irvine did not introduce any evidence to explain\r\nwhy it should have been reasonably foreseeable to Murad that \r\nmaking its products available in Puerto Rico at lower prices would\r\nsomehow affect her personally.  At trial when asked by her counsel\r\nto describe her relationship with Murad, separate from that of IRG,\r\nIrvine merely responded that it was \"cordial\" and that she found\r\nDr. Murad \"very pleasant.\"  Her testimony in this regard was\r\ncircumscribed by the tenor of her and her daughter's contacts with\r\nthe Murad representatives.  No mention was made of any particular\r\ncircumstances in her dealings with Murad which would support her\r\nindividual claim.\r\nAdditionally, the documentary evidence submitted at trial\r\nfurther supports Murad's theory.  The distribution agreement was\r\nmade with the corporation, not Irvine.  All the correspondence\r\navailable in the record which was exchanged between Murad and\r\nplaintiffs/appellants was conducted through the corporation.\r\nAccordingly, Irvine did not produce any evidence at trial\r\nfrom which the jury could reasonably conclude that her personal\r\ndamages were a probable and foreseeable consequence of Murad's\r\ninfomercial.  Irvine's individual claim must also be DISMISSED for\r\nhaving failed to meet her burden of proof.\r\n                          CONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, we direct the district court to set aside\r\nthe judgments on both the corporate and individual claims and enter\r\njudgment as a matter of law in the appellant's favor. \n",
