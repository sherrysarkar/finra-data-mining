This is an appeal\r                                                    \r\n\nfrom  the  district  court's  partial  denial  of  defendant-\r\n\nappellant Edwin P.  Joseph's 28  U.S.C.   2255  motion.   The\r\n\ndistrict  court, applying the Supreme Court's recent decision\r\n\nin  Bailey v. United States, 116 S. Ct. 501 (1995), dismissed\r                                       \r\n\nJoseph's 1991 conviction under  18 U.S.C.   924(c) (use  of a\r\n\nfirearm during and  in relation to a drug trafficking crime),\r\n\nand  vacated his sixty  month sentence  for that  offense, of\r\n\nwhich  Joseph had  already  served over  half.   Noting  that\r\n\nJoseph had long since completed serving  the sentences on two\r\n\nother charges to  which    along with the    924(c) charge   \r\n\nhe had pleaded guilty in 1991, the district court ordered his\r\n\nrelease.     However,  the  court  also   directed  that  the\r\n\nconcurrent  three  and  five year  supervised  release  terms\r\n\nstemming from the two other charges begin operating.\r\n\n          Joseph argues on appeal, as he did in his 28 U.S.C.\r\n\n  2255 motion, that the court erred in not ordering the terms\r\n\nof  supervised  release to  have begun  on  the date  the two\r\n\nserved  sentences  had ended,  to wit  on December  22, 1992,\r\n\nrather than on the date of his actual release in 1996.  Under\r\n\nthis  theory,  Joseph's  supervised release  terms  would  be\r\n\nreduced  by  the  time he  spent  in  prison  under the  now-\r\n\ndismissed    924(c) conviction.   Alternatively,  Joseph asks\r\n\nthat the supervised release terms be eliminated altogether to\r\n\ncompensate him for the  deprivation of his freedom, resulting\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nfrom the wrongful conviction and sentence under   924(c).  We\r\n\ndo  not accept  Joseph's contention  and affirm  the district\r\n\ncourt's direction that the supervisory release terms commence\r\n\non the actual release date.\r\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r\n\n          On June 27, 1991, agents of the Bureau  of Alcohol,\r\n\nTobacco and Firearms arrived at Joseph's residence to execute\r\n\narrest and  search warrants.   While searching  the residence\r\n\nfor weapons, the agents  found several weapons, along with  a\r\n\nsmall  quantity of  cocaine and  a scale.   The  weapons were\r\n\nlocated in  a closet in  the living  room, under a  couch and\r\n\nunder a mattress in the bedroom.  Joseph was arrested.  \r\n\n          On July 31, 1991, Joseph pleaded guilty to a three-\r\n\ncount information charging him with illegal sale of firearms,\r\n\nin violation of 18 U.S.C.   922(a)(5) (count one); possession\r\n\nwith intent to  distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C.\r\n\n  841(a)(1) (count two);  and use of a firearm during  and in\r\n\nrelation to a drug crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C.    924(c)\r\n\n(count three).  \r\n\n          On October  10, 1991, the district  court sentenced\r\n\nJoseph to  concurrent twenty-one month terms  of imprisonment\r\n\non counts one and two, and  a consecutive sixty month term on\r\n\ncount three,  as mandated by  the statute.   See 18  U.S.C.  \r                                                            \r\n\n924(c)(1) (West Supp. 1996).  The district court also imposed\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\na supervised release term of three years on count  one, and a\r\n\nconcurrentsupervised release term of five years on count two.\r\n\n          On or about March 31,  1993, Joseph filed his first\r\n\n28 U.S.C.    2255 motion.   He alleged,  among other  things,\r\n\nthat he had been deprived of  his right to appeal because  of\r\n\ncounsel's ineffective assistance.  The district court reduced\r\n\nthe amount of the  fine imposed to $20,000 from  the original\r\n\namount of $70,000.  But  all the other sentencing  provisions\r\n\nof the original judgment remained unchanged.\r\n\n          On  or about  January  16, 1996,  Joseph filed  his\r\n\nsecond  28 U.S.C.   2255 motion.  Invoking Bailey1, he argued\r                                                             \r\n\nthat his 18  U.S.C.   924(c) conviction  (count three) should\r\n\nbe vacated.   He also contended  that his supervised  release\r\n\nterms under the other counts should \"be reduced to adequately\r\n\nreflect the excessive time  [he] has served in prison.\"   The\r\n\ngovernment, in a  response to Joseph's  motion, said that  it\r\n\ndid not oppose vacation of his conviction under   924(c).\r\n\n          On March  27, 1996,  the  district court  announced\r\n\nthat  it vacated  Joseph's conviction  and sentence  on count\r\n\nthree,  and  dismissed  that count.    It  noted  that, as  a\r\n\nconsequence (Joseph  having long since completed  the twenty-\r\n\none  month concurrent  sentences on counts  one and  two), he\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.   In Bailey, the Supreme Court explained that the \"use\" of\r                          \r\nfirearms,  for    924(c)(1) purposes,  includes \"brandishing,\r\ndisplaying,  bartering, striking  with,  and most  obviously,\r\nfiring, or  attempting to  fire, a firearm\",  but not  merely\r\nstoring a gun near drugs.  Bailey, 116 S. Ct. at 508.\r                                             \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nwould  be released from custody.   The court  stated that the\r\n\nsupervised  release  terms under  counts  one  and two  would\r\n\ncommence  to  operate.   A  conforming  amended judgment  was\r\n\nentered the next day.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r\n\n          The  government expressly  stated that  it did  not\r\n\noppose  vacation of Joseph's    924(c) conviction for using a\r\n\nfirearm.  In its brief, the government states that it \"agreed\r\n\nthat the  Petitioner's   924(c) conviction  could not survive\r\n\nBailey.\"   We agree that  the evidence of  firearm \"use\" here\r                  \r\n\nwas  insufficient to  pass muster  under  Bailey.   A further\r                                                            \r\n\nquestion might  be whether Bailey has retroactive application\r                                             \r\n\nto  prior cases like this on collateral review.  However, the\r\n\ngovernment's  concession that Joseph's  conviction \"could not\r\n\nsurvive  Bailey\" waives  any  contest over  that point.2   We\r                           \r\n\naccordingly proceed to  the sole question in this appeal, the\r\n\ntiming and  operation of the  supervisory release  provisions\r\n\nfrom the sentences on the two valid counts. \r\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r\n\n          Assuming  without  deciding  that   Bailey  applies\r                                                                \r\n\nretroactively  to \"use\"  cases on  collateral review,  we now\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.    Several   courts  have   ruled   that  Bailey   applies\r                                                               \r\nretroactively.  See,  e.g., Guzman-Rivera  v. United  States,\r                                                                        \r\n933  F. Supp.  138,  143 (D.P.R.  1996);  Sanabria v.

Barnhardt,  93 F.3d 706,  708-09 (10th Cir.  1996); United\r                                                                         \r\nStates  v. Cota-Loaiza,  936  F. Supp.  751, 753-54  (D.Colo.\r                                  \r\n1996).\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nconsider  Joseph's appellate  challenges  to  his  supervised\r\n\nrelease  terms.   After completing  service  of the  terms of\r\n\nimprisonment under counts one and two, Joseph spent more than\r\n\nthirty-nine additional months in prison under the consecutive\r\n\nsentence imposed  on the 18  U.S.C.   924(c)(1)  count before\r\n\nthat conviction  was dismissed, and the  sentence vacated, by\r\n\nthe  district court.  Joseph  contends he is  entitled to, at\r\n\nleast,  a  thirty-nine month  credit  against  his supervised\r\n\nrelease  terms  on  the other  two  counts.    His arguments,\r\n\nhowever, are contrary to the language of 18 U.S.C.   3624 and\r\n\nthey also run  counter to the purposes of  supervised release\r\n\nterms,  which are  not  alternative forms  of punishment  but\r\n\nrather are  designed to ease a prisoner's  return to civilian\r\n\nlife.   Joseph's arguments also fail to take into account the\r\n\navailability of relief under 18 U.S.C.   3583(e).\r\n\n(1) The Language of 18 U.S.C.   3624.\r                                                 \r\n\n          Section  3624 provides  that  a person's  \"term  of\r\n\nsupervised  release  commences  on  the  day  the  person  is\r\n\nreleased  from imprisonment  . . . \", and  that \"[a]  term of\r\n\nsupervised  release does not  run during any  period in which\r\n\nthe person is imprisoned in  connection with a conviction for\r\n\na  Federal, State,  or  local crime  . . . .\"   18  U.S.C.   \r\n\n3624(e) (West Supp. 1996) (Supervision after Release).  These\r\n\nprovisions are, on their  face, contrary to Joseph's argument\r\n\nthat his supervised  release terms should  be deemed to  have\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nbegun on the  day that his  concurrent sentences under  count\r\n\none  and  count two  expired, since  he  was in  prison then,\r\n\nserving what, at the time, was a valid sentence for violation\r\n\nof   924(c)(1).3   Joseph  points out, however,  that    3624\r\n\nalso provides  that \"[a]  prisoner shall  be released  by the\r\n\nBureau  of Prisons  on  the date  of  the expiration  of  the\r\n\nprisoner's term of imprisonment . . . .\"  18 U.S.C.   3624(a)\r\n\n(West  Supp.  1996) (Date  of Release).    He argues  that he\r\n\nshould have been released late in 1992, as  that was when his\r\n\nterms of imprisonment for the other  two counts expired, they\r\n\nbeing  the only  valid counts  (as now  but not  then known),\r\n\ngiven the holding in Bailey.    \r                                       \r\n\n          In  so  arguing,  Joseph  relies on  the  Court  of\r\n\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit's  decision in United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nBlake,   88  F.3d  824  (9th  Cir.  1996).    In  Blake,  the\r                                                                   \r\n\ndefendants'  custodial sentences were  reduced below the time\r\n\nthey  had  already  served   in  prison  by  the  retroactive\r\n\napplication of  a clarifying  amendment to the  United States\r\n\nSentencing Guidelines.  The government, nonetheless, used the\r\n\ndefendants' actual  release dates  as the starting  dates for\r                                             \r\n\nmeasuring the duration of the  three year terms of supervised\r\n\nrelease.

This  circuit, like  many at  the  time, had  adopted a\r\nbroader definition of  the term \"use\" than the  Supreme Court\r\nheld was acceptable in its 1995 Bailey decision.\r                                                  \r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n          The  court  of appeals  held  that  the defendants'\r\n\nterms  of supervised release should be deemed to have started\r\n\non  the day  that they  should have  been released  under the\r                                                              \r\n\nreduced sentences.

Furthermore, the Blake Court stated that its ruling was\r                                        \r\n\ndictated  by  the  circuit  precedent  of  United  States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nMontenegro-Rojo, 908 F.2d 425,  431 n.8 (9th Cir.  1990) (\"If\r                           \r\n\nthe district  court  decides to  shorten  the extent  of  its\r\n\ndeparture [from  the Sentencing  Guidelines], the extra  time\r\n\nMontenegro-Rojo spent in jail should, in fairness, be counted\r\n\ntowards the year  of supervised release.\").   Thus, the Blake\r                                                                         \r\n\nCourt concluded that, in  view of the language of    3624(a),\r\n\nand \"the obvious  purpose of leniency in applying the revised\r\n\nsentencing guidelines retroactively\", Blake, 88 F.3d at  825,\r                                                       \r\n\nit  was bound  to follow  Montenegro-Rojo, and to  direct the\r                                                     \r\n\ndistrict   court  to   modify  the   commencement   dates  of\r\n\ndefendants' supervised release terms.\r\n\n          According to Joseph, his  situation is analogous to\r\n\nBlake.  Joseph contends that the application of Blake to this\r                                                                 \r\n\ncase leads  to the inevitable conclusion  that his supervised\r\n\nrelease  terms should be deemed to have begun on December 22,\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\n1992, the date on which he should have finished  his terms of\r\n\nimprisonment.\r\n\n          We are not persuaded  by Joseph's arguments, nor by\r\n\nthe rationale of Blake and Montenegro-Rojo.  The fact remains\r                                                      \r\n\nthat   3624(e)  ties the  beginning of a  term of  supervised\r\n\nrelease to release from imprisonment.  It forbids the running\r\n\nof  the term of supervised release during any period in which\r\n\nthe  person is imprisoned.  Joseph was  in prison at the time\r\n\nhe  now seeks to  identify as the  beginning of  his terms of\r\n\nsupervised release and  was, under  the plain  language of   \r\n\n3624(e), ineligible for supervised release then.  \r\n\n          To be sure, an equitable argument can be made that,\r\n\nwhile  Joseph could not in  any real sense  have expected his\r\n\nterms of supervised release to start on December 22, 1992, he\r\n\nshould be  given credit for incarceration  now found improper\r\n\nby  offsetting the excess time he spent in prison against the\r\n\nterms  of supervised release.   However,  while we  have some\r\n\nsympathy  for this argument, we  reject it for  much the same\r\n\nreasons the Court of Appeals for  the Eighth Circuit rejected\r\n\na similar argument in  United States v. Douglas, 88  F.3d 533\r                                                           \r\n\n(8th Cir. 1996).   In Douglas, the  defendant was resentenced\r                                         \r\n\nto a substantially lower prison term pursuant to a clarifying\r\n\namendment to the Sentencing Guidelines.  Since he had already\r\n\nserved several months beyond  his newly imposed sentence, the\r\n\ndefendant sought credit  against his supervised  release term\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nfor  the  excess time  spent in  prison.   The  Douglas Court\r                                                                   \r\n\nrefused  to grant  such  credit, noting  that \"[t]he  statute\r\n\ndealing with  the release of  a prisoner plainly  states that\r\n\nsupervised  release  'commences  on  the day  the  person  is\r\n\nreleased  from imprisonment,'  and 'does  not run  during any\r\n\nperiod in which the person is imprisoned in connection with a\r\n\nconviction  for   a  Federal  . . . crime.'\"     Id.  at  534\r                                                                \r\n\n(citations omitted).  The court went on to note \"that this is\r\n\nconsistent   with  the   distinctly  different   purposes  of\r\n\nimprisonment  and  supervised   release.\"    Id.   (citations\r                                                            \r\n\nomitted).\r\n\n          Joseph attempts  to distinguish Douglas  by arguing\r                                                             \r\n\nthat  the defendant in that case never claimed that he should\r\n\nnot have been  convicted of  the particular crime.   He  also\r\n\nconsiders relevant the fact that no change in the substantive\r\n\nlaw or  application of  a guideline amendment  eliminated the\r\n\nconviction previously  entered by the district  court in that\r\n\ncase.   These  distinctions,  however,  do  not  seem  to  us\r\n\ndispositive.   The bottom line  is that both  cases deal with\r\n\nchanges  yielding the same result: a reduction in the term of\r\n\nimprisonment beyond the time already served.\r\n\n          Even so,  Joseph maintains  that he could  not have\r\n\nbeen  imprisoned for a federal crime that he, as the district\r\n\ncourt's  ruling recognized,  could not  have committed.   He,\r\n\nthus, contends that, even applying the language of   3624(e),\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nhis supervised release terms  should revert back to  the date\r\n\nof release for the valid convictions, since he could not have\r\n\nbeen  imprisoned for  the  use of  a  firearm during  and  in\r\n\nrelation to a drug crime.  But, as already noted, when Joseph\r\n\npleaded guilty  and was sentenced  in 1991, the  sentence for\r\n\nhis  18 U.S.C.     924(c)(1) conviction  was appropriate  and\r\n\n\"legal\", being in accordance  with a statutory interpretation\r\n\nthen enforced, and of  course believed to be correct,  by the\r\n\ncourts having jurisdiction over his case.  It was only in the\r\n\nwake of the Bailey  decision in 1995 that his  conviction and\r                              \r\n\nsentence under  count three  of the original  indictment were\r\n\nrecognized  as being contrary to  the law, at  which point he\r\n\nwas immediately  relieved of the remaining  sentence for that\r\n\ncount and  released from prison.   It was at this  point that\r\n\nhis supervised  release terms,  in accordance with  the plain\r\n\nlanguage of   3624(e), began to operate.  \r\n\n          Lastly,  Joseph asserts  that the  statutory scheme\r\n\ncodified in   3624  did not contemplate a situation  like the\r\n\none  presented in  this case.   He  argues that  a reasonable\r\n\nreading  of    3624 would  imply  the unwritten  language \"or\r\n\nshould have been released.\"  Congress, however, did not place\r\n\nsuch language in    3624, and,  given the entirely  different\r\n\npurposes  served by imprisonment  and supervised  release, we\r\n\nsee  no clear  basis for implying  it now.   Rather, like the\r\n\nEighth  Circuit in Douglas, we believe that the language in  \r                                      \r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\n3624(e) must be\n",

Joseph's 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 motion.  The district court, applying the Supreme Court's recent decision in Bailey v. United States, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995), dismissed Joseph's 1991 conviction under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) (use of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime), and vacated his sixty month sentence for that offense, of which Joseph had already served over half.  Noting that Joseph had long since completed serving the sentences on two other charges to which--along with the &#167; 924(c) charge--he had pleaded guilty in 1991, the district court ordered his release.  However, the court also directed that the concurrent three and five year supervised release terms stemming from the two other charges begin operating.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Joseph argues on appeal, as he did in his 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 motion, that the court erred in not ordering the terms of supervised release to have begun on the date the two served sentences had ended, to wit on December 22, 1992, rather than on the date of his actual release in 1996.  Under this theory, Joseph's supervised release terms would be reduced by the time he spent in prison under the now-dismissed &#167; 924(c) conviction.  Alternatively, Joseph asks that the supervised release terms be eliminated altogether to compensate him for the deprivation of his freedom, resulting from the wrongful conviction and sentence under &#167; 924(c).  We do not accept Joseph's contention and affirm the district court's direction that the supervisory release terms commence on the actual release date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 27, 1991, agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms arrived at Joseph's residence to execute arrest and search warrants.  While searching the residence for weapons, the agents found several weapons, along with a small quantity of cocaine and a scale.  The weapons were located in a closet in the living room, under a couch and under a mattress in the bedroom.  Joseph was arrested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 31, 1991, Joseph pleaded guilty to a three-count information charging him with illegal sale of firearms, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(a)(5) (count one);  possession with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) (count two);  and use of a firearm during and in relation to a drug crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) (count three).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 10, 1991, the district court sentenced Joseph to concurrent twenty-one month terms of imprisonment on counts one and two, and a consecutive sixty month term on count three, as mandated by the statute.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1) (West Supp.1996).  The district court also imposed a supervised release term of three years on count one, and a concurrent supervised release term of five years on count two.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about March 31, 1993, Joseph filed his first 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 motion.  He alleged, among other things, that he had been deprived of his right to appeal because of counsel's ineffective assistance.  The district court reduced the amount of the fine imposed to $20,000 from the original amount of $70,000.  But all the other sentencing provisions of the original judgment remained unchanged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about January 16, 1996, Joseph filed his second 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 motion.  Invoking Bailey<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>, he argued that his 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) conviction (count three) should be vacated.  He also contended that his supervised release terms under the other counts should \"be reduced to adequately reflect the excessive time [he] has served in prison.\"   The government, in a response to Joseph's motion, said that it did not oppose vacation of his conviction under &#167; 924(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 27, 1996, the district court announced that it vacated Joseph's conviction and sentence on count three, and dismissed that count.  It noted that, as a consequence (Joseph having long since completed the twenty-one month concurrent sentences on counts one and two), he would be released from custody.  The court stated that the supervised release terms under counts one and two would commence to operate.  A conforming amended judgment was entered the next day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government expressly stated that it did not oppose vacation of Joseph's &#167; 924(c) conviction for using a firearm.  In its brief, the government states that it \"agreed that the Petitioner's &#167; 924(c) conviction could not survive Bailey.\"   We agree that the evidence of firearm \"use\" here was insufficient to pass muster under Bailey.   A further question might be whether Bailey has retroactive application to prior cases like this on collateral review.  However, the government's concession that Joseph's conviction \"could not survive Bailey \" waives any contest over that point.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  We accordingly proceed to the sole question in this appeal, the timing and operation of the supervisory release provisions from the sentences on the two valid counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming without deciding that Bailey applies retroactively to \"use\" cases on collateral review, we now consider Joseph's appellate challenges to his supervised release terms.  After completing service of the terms of imprisonment under counts one and two, Joseph spent more than thirty-nine additional months in prison under the consecutive sentence imposed on the 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1) count before that conviction was dismissed, and the sentence vacated, by the district court.  Joseph contends he is entitled to, at least, a thirty-nine month credit against his supervised release terms on the other two counts.  His arguments, however, are contrary to the language of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3624 and they also run counter to the purposes of supervised release terms, which are not alternative forms of punishment but rather are designed to ease a prisoner's return to civilian life.  Joseph's arguments also fail to take into account the availability of relief under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>(1) The Language of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3624.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 3624 provides that a person's \"term of supervised release commences on the day the person is released from imprisonment ... \", and that \"[a] term of supervised release does not run during any period in which the person is imprisoned in connection with a conviction for a Federal, State, or local crime....\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3624(e) (West Supp.1996) (Supervision after Release).  These provisions are, on their face, contrary to Joseph's argument that his supervised release terms should be deemed to have begun on the day that his concurrent sentences under count one and count two expired, since he was in prison then, serving what, at the time, was a valid sentence for violation of &#167;   924(c)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Joseph points out, however, that &#167; 3624 also provides that \"[a] prisoner shall be released by the Bureau of Prisons on the date of the expiration of the prisoner's term of imprisonment....\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3624(a) (West Supp.1996) (Date of Release).  He argues that he should have been released latein 1992, as that was when his terms of imprisonment for the other two counts expired, they being the only valid counts (as now but not then known), given the holding in Bailey.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In so arguing, Joseph relies on the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit's decision in United States v. Blake, 88 F.3d 824 (9th Cir.1996).  In Blake, the defendants' custodial sentences were reduced below the time they had already served in prison by the retroactive application of a clarifying amendment to the United States Sentencing Guidelines.  The government, nonetheless, used the defendants' actual release dates as the starting dates for measuring the duration of the three year terms of supervised release.  See Id. at 825.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court of appeals held that the defendants' terms of supervised release should be deemed to have started on the day that they should have been released under the reduced sentences.  The Blake Court read the language of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3624(a) to set \"the date of release, and consequently the commencement of a supervised release term, at the time a prisoner's term expires.\"  Blake, 88 F.3d at 825.   Furthermore, the Blake Court stated that its ruling was dictated by the circuit precedent of United States v. Montenegro-Rojo, 908 F.2d 425, 431 n. 8 (9th Cir.1990) (\"If the district court decides to shorten the extent of its departure [from the Sentencing Guidelines], the extra time Montenegro-Rojo spent in jail should, in fairness, be counted towards the year of supervised release.\").  Thus, the Blake Court concluded that, in view of the language of &#167; 3624(a), and \"the obvious purpose of leniency in applying the revised sentencing guidelines retroactively\", Blake, 88 F.3d at 825, it was bound to follow Montenegro-Rojo, and to direct the district court to modify the commencement dates of defendants' supervised release terms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Joseph, his situation is analogous to Blake.   Joseph contends that the application of Blake to this case leads to the inevitable conclusion that his supervised release terms should be deemed to have begun on December 22, 1992, the date on which he should have finished his terms of imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not persuaded by Joseph's arguments, nor by the rationale of Blake and Montenegro-Rojo.   The fact remains that &#167; 3624(e) ties the beginning of a term of supervised release to release from imprisonment.  It forbids the running of the term of supervised release during any period in which the person is imprisoned.  Joseph was in prison at the time he now seeks to identify as the beginning of his terms of supervised release and was, under the plain language of &#167; 3624(e), ineligible for supervised release then.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, an equitable argument can be made that, while Joseph could not in any real sense have expected his terms of supervised release to start on December 22, 1992, he should be given credit for incarceration now found improper by offsetting the excess time he spent in prison against the terms of supervised release.  However, while we have some sympathy for this argument, we reject it for much the same reasons the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit rejected a similar argument in United States v. Douglas, 88 F.3d 533 (8th Cir.1996).  In Douglas, the defendant was resentenced to a substantially lower prison term pursuant to a clarifying amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines.  Since he had already served several months beyond his newly imposed sentence, the defendant sought credit against his supervised release term for the excess time spent in prison.  The Douglas Court refused to grant such credit, noting that \"[t]he statute dealing with the release of a prisoner plainly states that supervised release 'commences on the day the person is released from imprisonment,' and 'does not run during any period in which the person is imprisoned in connection with a conviction for a Federal ... crime.' \"  Id. at 534 (citations omitted).  The court went on to note \"that this is consistent with the distinctly different purposes of imprisonment and supervised release.\"  Id. (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Joseph attempts to distinguish Douglas by arguing that the defendant in that case never claimed that he should not have been convicted of the particular crime.  He also considers relevant the fact that no change in the substantive law or application of a guideline amendment eliminated the conviction previously entered by the district court in that case.  These distinctions, however, do not seem to us dispositive.  The bottom line is that both cases deal with changes yielding the same result:  a reduction in the term of imprisonment beyond the time already served.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even so, Joseph maintains that he could not have been imprisoned for a federal crime that he, as the district court's ruling recognized, could not have committed.  He, thus, contends that, even applying the language of &#167; 3624(e), his supervised release terms should revert back to the date of release for the valid convictions, since he could not have been imprisoned for the use of a firearm during and in relation to a drug crime.  But, as already noted, when Joseph pleaded guilty and was sentenced in 1991, the sentence for his 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1) conviction was appropriate and \"legal\", being in accordance with a statutory interpretation then enforced, and of course believed to be correct, by the courts having jurisdiction over his case.  It was only in the wake of the Bailey decision in 1995 that his conviction and sentence under count three of the original indictment were recognized as being contrary to the law, at which point he was immediately relieved of the remaining sentence for that count and released from prison.  It was at this point that his supervised release terms, in accordance with the plain language of &#167; 3624(e), began to operate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, Joseph asserts that the statutory scheme codified in &#167; 3624 did not contemplate a situation like the one presented in this case.  He argues that a reasonable reading of &#167; 3624 would imply the unwritten language \"or should have been released.\"   Congress, however, did not place such language in &#167; 3624, and, given the entirely different purposes served by imprisonment and supervised release, we see no clear basis for implying it now.  Rather, like the Eighth Circuit in Douglas, we believe that the language in &#167; 3624(e) must be given its plain and literal meaning.  See also Quinones v. United States, 936 F.Supp. 153, 155 (S.D.N.Y.1996) (\"the statute provides clearly that a person's term of supervised release does not begin until the person has been released from prison and does not run while a person is in prison.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>(2) The Purposes of Supervised Release Terms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Joseph contends that the excess time he served in prison fulfilled the purposes underlying supervised release terms.  See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual, &#167; 5D1.1, comment.  (n. 1) (Nov.1995);  id. at &#167; 5D1.3(b)(2) (supervised release conditions may be imposed \"to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, and to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district judge indicated that he had ordered a supervised release term of three years on count one and a concurrent supervised release term of five years on count two \"to see that [Joseph] doesn't revert to criminal behavior again.\"   But Joseph argues that, for more than thirty-nine months, the government was able to closely monitor him from his own cell at a federal correctional institution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding these contentions, imprisonment and supervised release are designed to serve very different purposes.  See Douglas, 88 F.3d at 534 (citing United States v. Love, 19 F.3d 415, 417 &amp; n. 4 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 967, 115 S.Ct. 434, 130 L.Ed.2d 346 (1994)).  Rather than being punitive, supervised release is intended to facilitate \"the integration of the violator into the community, while providing the supervision designed to limit further criminal conduct.\"  U.S.S.G. Ch. 7, Pt. A, comment.  (n. 4), p.s.;   see also Quinones, 936 F.Supp. at 155.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Incarceration, to the contrary, does nothing to assist a defendant's transition back into society and is not a reasonable substitute for a portion of the supervised release term.  See United States v. Vallejo, 69 F.3d 992, 994 (9th Cir.1995) (purposes of supervised release are not served until the defendant is actually subject to the terms and conditions of his supervised release).  One can argue that the more time a defendant serves in prison, the greater his need for a period of supervised release.  In this case, as was true in Douglas, 88 F.3d at 534, the public safety is served by retention of a significant period of supervised release, as Joseph has an extensive criminal history.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  We see no meaningful basis for a simple tradeoff between time spent in prison and the supervised time spent after release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>(3) The Availability of Relief under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further weakening Joseph's equitable argument is the existence of a special statutory mechanism available for modifying supervised release terms.  Under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e), a defendant can ask the district court to grant early termination of his supervised release terms \"in the interests of justice\", after completing one full year of supervised release.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  That provision strongly implies Congress's judgment that the proper reintegration of formerly incarcerated offenders into the community requires, at the very least, one year of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The availability of this mechanism, which will enable Joseph to argue whatever points of equity and fairness he thinks persuasive to the district court, further persuades us not to invent some form of automatic credit or reduction here to compensate for Joseph's increased incarceration.  If Joseph's conduct and future prospects warrant, the district court may yet, upon Joseph's petition under &#167; 3583(e), modify the period of his probation taking into account \"the interests of justice\", which here could include, in the court's discretion, any special unfairness perceived to exist because of the unusual circumstances of his case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In Bailey, the Supreme Court explained that the \"use\" of firearms, for &#167; 924(c)(1) purposes, includes \"brandishing, displaying, bartering, striking with, and most obviously, firing, or attempting to fire, a firearm\", but not merely storing a gun near drugs.

Joseph's 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 motion.  The district court, applying the Supreme Court's recent decision in Bailey v. United States, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117985\"><a href=\"/opinion/117985/bailey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Noting that Joseph had long since completed serving the sentences on two other charges to which--along with the &#167; 924(c) charge--he had pleaded guilty in 1991, the district court ordered his release.  However, the court also directed that the concurrent three and five year supervised release terms stemming from the two other charges begin operating.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Joseph argues on appeal, as he did in his 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 motion, that the court erred in not ordering the terms of supervised release to have begun on the date the two served sentences had ended, to wit on December 22, 1992, rather than on the date of his actual release in 1996.  Under this theory, Joseph's supervised release terms would be reduced by the time he spent in prison under the now-dismissed &#167; 924(c) conviction.  Alternatively, Joseph asks that the supervised release terms be eliminated altogether to compensate him for the deprivation of his freedom, resulting from the wrongful conviction and sentence under &#167; 924(c).  We do not accept Joseph's contention and affirm the district court's direction that the supervisory release terms commence on the actual release date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 27, 1991, agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms arrived at Joseph's residence to execute arrest and search warrants.  While searching the residence for weapons, the agents found several weapons, along with a small quantity of cocaine and a scale.  The weapons were located in a closet in the living room, under a couch and under a mattress in the bedroom.  Joseph was arrested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 31, 1991, Joseph pleaded guilty to a three-count information charging him with illegal sale of firearms, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(a)(5) (count one);  possession with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) (count two);  and use of a firearm during and in relation to a drug crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) (count three).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 10, 1991, the district court sentenced Joseph to concurrent twenty-one month terms of imprisonment on counts one and two, and a consecutive sixty month term on count three, as mandated by the statute.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1) (West Supp.1996).  The district court also imposed a supervised release term of three years on count one, and a concurrent supervised release term of five years on count two.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about March 31, 1993, Joseph filed his first 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 motion.  He alleged, among other things, that he had been deprived of his right to appeal because of counsel's ineffective assistance.  The district court reduced the amount of the fine imposed to $20,000 from the original amount of $70,000.  But all the other sentencing provisions of the original judgment remained unchanged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about January 16, 1996, Joseph filed his second 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 motion.  Invoking Bailey<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>, he argued that his 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) conviction (count three) should be vacated.  He also contended that his supervised release terms under the other counts should \"be reduced to adequately reflect the excessive time [he] has served in prison.\"   The government, in a response to Joseph's motion, said that it did not oppose vacation of his conviction under &#167; 924(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 27, 1996, the district court announced that it vacated Joseph's conviction and sentence on count three, and dismissed that count.  It noted that, as a consequence (Joseph having long since completed the twenty-one month concurrent sentences on counts one and two), he would be released from custody.  The court stated that the supervised release terms under counts one and two would commence to operate.  A conforming amended judgment was entered the next day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government expressly stated that it did not oppose vacation of Joseph's &#167; 924(c) conviction for using a firearm.  In its brief, the government states that it \"agreed that the Petitioner's &#167; 924(c) conviction could not survive Bailey.\"   We agree that the evidence of firearm \"use\" here was insufficient to pass muster under Bailey.   A further question might be whether Bailey has retroactive application to prior cases like this on collateral review.  However, the government's concession that Joseph's conviction \"could not survive Bailey \" waives any contest over that point.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  We accordingly proceed to the sole question in this appeal, the timing and operation of the supervisory release provisions from the sentences on the two valid counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming without deciding that Bailey applies retroactively to \"use\" cases on collateral review, we now consider Joseph's appellate challenges to his supervised release terms.  After completing service of the terms of imprisonment under counts one and two, Joseph spent more than thirty-nine additional months in prison under the consecutive sentence imposed on the 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1) count before that conviction was dismissed, and the sentence vacated, by the district court.  Joseph contends he is entitled to, at least, a thirty-nine month credit against his supervised release terms on the other two counts.  His arguments, however, are contrary to the language of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3624 and they also run counter to the purposes of supervised release terms, which are not alternative forms of punishment but rather are designed to ease a prisoner's return to civilian life.  Joseph's arguments also fail to take into account the availability of relief under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>(1) The Language of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3624.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 3624 provides that a person's \"term of supervised release commences on the day the person is released from imprisonment ... \", and that \"[a] term of supervised release does not run during any period in which the person is imprisoned in connection with a conviction for a Federal, State, or local crime....\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3624(e) (West Supp.1996) (Supervision after Release).  These provisions are, on their face, contrary to Joseph's argument that his supervised release terms should be deemed to have begun on the day that his concurrent sentences under count one and count two expired, since he was in prison then, serving what, at the time, was a valid sentence for violation of &#167;   924(c)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Joseph points out, however, that &#167; 3624 also provides that \"[a] prisoner shall be released by the Bureau of Prisons on the date of the expiration of the prisoner's term of imprisonment....\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3624(a) (West Supp.1996) (Date of Release).  He argues that he should have been released latein 1992, as that was when his terms of imprisonment for the other two counts expired, they being the only valid counts (as now but not then known), given the holding in Bailey.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In so arguing, Joseph relies on the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit's decision in United States v. Blake, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"721410\"><a href=\"/opinion/721410/97-cal-daily-op-serv-5139-96-daily-journal-dar-8284-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">824</span></a></span> (9th Cir.1996).  In Blake, the defendants' custodial sentences were reduced below the time they had already served in prison by the retroactive application of a clarifying amendment to the United States Sentencing Guidelines.  The government, nonetheless, used the defendants' actual release dates as the starting dates for measuring the duration of the three year terms of supervised release.  See Id. at 825.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court of appeals held that the defendants' terms of supervised release should be deemed to have started on the day that they should have been released under the reduced sentences.  The Blake Court read the language of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3624(a) to set \"the date of release, and consequently the commencement of a supervised release term, at the time a prisoner's term expires.\"  Blake, 88 F.3d at 825.   Furthermore, the Blake Court stated that its ruling was dictated by the circuit precedent of United States v. Montenegro-Rojo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"544728\"><a href=\"/opinion/544728/united-states-v-luis-montenegro-rojo/\"><span class=\"volume\">908</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">425</span></a></span>, 431 n. 8 (9th Cir.1990) (\"If the district court decides to shorten the extent of its departure [from the Sentencing Guidelines], the extra time Montenegro-Rojo spent in jail should, in fairness, be counted towards the year of supervised release.\").  Thus, the Blake Court concluded that, in view of the language of &#167; 3624(a), and \"the obvious purpose of leniency in applying the revised sentencing guidelines retroactively\", Blake, 88 F.3d at 825, it was bound to follow Montenegro-Rojo, and to direct the district court to modify the commencement dates of defendants' supervised release terms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Joseph, his situation is analogous to Blake.   Joseph contends that the application of Blake to this case leads to the inevitable conclusion that his supervised release terms should be deemed to have begun on December 22, 1992, the date on which he should have finished his terms of imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not persuaded by Joseph's arguments, nor by the rationale of Blake and Montenegro-Rojo.   The fact remains that &#167; 3624(e) ties the beginning of a term of supervised release to release from imprisonment.  It forbids the running of the term of supervised release during any period in which the person is imprisoned.  Joseph was in prison at the time he now seeks to identify as the beginning of his terms of supervised release and was, under the plain language of &#167; 3624(e), ineligible for supervised release then.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, an equitable argument can be made that, while Joseph could not in any real sense have expected his terms of supervised release to start on December 22, 1992, he should be given credit for incarceration now found improper by offsetting the excess time he spent in prison against the terms of supervised release.  However, while we have some sympathy for this argument, we reject it for much the same reasons the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit rejected a similar argument in United States v. Douglas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"721362\"><a href=\"/opinion/721362/united-states-v-frederick-douglas/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">533</span></a></span> (8th Cir.1996).  In Douglas, the defendant was resentenced to a substantially lower prison term pursuant to a clarifying amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines.  Since he had already served several months beyond his newly imposed sentence, the defendant sought credit against his supervised release term for the excess time spent in prison.  The Douglas Court refused to grant such credit, noting that \"[t]he statute dealing with the release of a prisoner plainly states that supervised release 'commences on the day the person is released from imprisonment,' and 'does not run during any period in which the person is imprisoned in connection with a conviction for a Federal ... crime.' \"  Id. at 534 (citations omitted).  The court went on to note \"that this is consistent with the distinctly different purposes of imprisonment and supervised release.\"  Id. (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Joseph attempts to distinguish Douglas by arguing that the defendant in that case never claimed that he should not have been convicted of the particular crime.  He also considers relevant the fact that no change in the substantive law or application of a guideline amendment eliminated the conviction previously entered by the district court in that case.  These distinctions, however, do not seem to us dispositive.  The bottom line is that both cases deal with changes yielding the same result:  a reduction in the term of imprisonment beyond the time already served.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even so, Joseph maintains that he could not have been imprisoned for a federal crime that he, as the district court's ruling recognized, could not have committed.  He, thus, contends that, even applying the language of &#167; 3624(e), his supervised release terms should revert back to the date of release for the valid convictions, since he could not have been imprisoned for the use of a firearm during and in relation to a drug crime.  But, as already noted, when Joseph pleaded guilty and was sentenced in 1991, the sentence for his 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1) conviction was appropriate and \"legal\", being in accordance with a statutory interpretation then enforced, and of course believed to be correct, by the courts having jurisdiction over his case.  It was only in the wake of the Bailey decision in 1995 that his conviction and sentence under count three of the original indictment were recognized as being contrary to the law, at which point he was immediately relieved of the remaining sentence for that count and released from prison.  It was at this point that his supervised release terms, in accordance with the plain language of &#167; 3624(e), began to operate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, Joseph asserts that the statutory scheme codified in &#167; 3624 did not contemplate a situation like the one presented in this case.  He argues that a reasonable reading of &#167; 3624 would imply the unwritten language \"or should have been released.\"   Congress, however, did not place such language in &#167; 3624, and, given the entirely different purposes served by imprisonment and supervised release, we see no clear basis for implying it now.  Rather, like the Eighth Circuit in Douglas, we believe that the language in &#167; 3624(e) must be given its plain and literal meaning.  See also Quinones v. United States, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></span>, 155 (S.D.N.Y.1996) (\"the statute provides clearly that a person's term of supervised release does not begin until the person has been released from prison and does not run while a person is in prison.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>(2) The Purposes of Supervised Release Terms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Joseph contends that the excess time he served in prison fulfilled the purposes underlying supervised release terms.  See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual, &#167; 5D1.1, comment.  (n. 1) (Nov.1995);  id. at &#167; 5D1.3(b)(2) (supervised release conditions may be imposed \"to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, and to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district judge indicated that he had ordered a supervised release term of three years on count one and a concurrent supervised release term of five years on count two \"to see that [Joseph] doesn't revert to criminal behavior again.\"   But Joseph argues that, for more than thirty-nine months, the government was able to closely monitor him from his own cell at a federal correctional institution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding these contentions, imprisonment and supervised release are designed to serve very different purposes.  See Douglas, 88 F.3d at 534 (citing United States v. Love, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"665840\"><a href=\"/opinion/665840/united-states-v-marvin-kennell-love-united-states-of-america-v-nancy-ann/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">415</span></a></span>, 417 &amp; n. 4 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">346</span></span> (1994)).  Rather than being punitive, supervised release is intended to facilitate \"the integration of the violator into the community, while providing the supervision designed to limit further criminal conduct.\"  U.S.S.G. Ch. 7, Pt. A, comment.  (n. 4), p.s.;   see also Quinones, 936 F.Supp. at 155.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Incarceration, to the contrary, does nothing to assist a defendant's transition back into society and is not a reasonable substitute for a portion of the supervised release term.  See United States v. Vallejo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"707569\"><a href=\"/opinion/707569/95-cal-daily-op-serv-8482-95-daily-journal-dar-14631-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">992</span></a></span>, 994 (9th Cir.1995) (purposes of supervised release are not served until the defendant is actually subject to the terms and conditions of his supervised release).  One can argue that the more time a defendant serves in prison, the greater his need for a period of supervised release.  In this case, as was true in Douglas, 88 F.3d at 534, the public safety is served by retention of a significant period of supervised release, as Joseph has an extensive criminal history.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  We see no meaningful basis for a simple tradeoff between time spent in prison and the supervised time spent after release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>(3) The Availability of Relief under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further weakening Joseph's equitable argument is the existence of a special statutory mechanism available for modifying supervised release terms.  Under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e), a defendant can ask the district court to grant early termination of his supervised release terms \"in the interests of justice\", after completing one full year of supervised release.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  That provision strongly implies Congress's judgment that the proper reintegration of formerly incarcerated offenders into the community requires, at the very least, one year of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The availability of this mechanism, which will enable Joseph to argue whatever points of equity and fairness he thinks persuasive to the district court, further persuades us not to invent some form of automatic credit or reduction here to compensate for Joseph's increased incarceration.  If Joseph's conduct and future prospects warrant, the district court may yet, upon Joseph's petition under &#167; 3583(e), modify the period of his probation taking into account \"the interests of justice\", which here could include, in the court's discretion, any special unfairness perceived to exist because of the unusual circumstances of his case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In Bailey, the Supreme Court explained that the \"use\" of firearms, for &#167; 924(c)(1) purposes, includes \"brandishing, displaying, bartering, striking with, and most obviously, firing, or attempting to fire, a firearm\", but not merely storing a gun near drugs.
