Lagana and Lagana &amp; Associates on brief for\r\npetitioner.\r\n\nOctober 13, 1998\r\n\n        Per Curiam.  Hatem Merkhael Sassine has filed a\r\npetition for review of a decision of the Board of Immigration\r\nAppeals (\"BIA\") denying as untimely his motion to reopen his\r\nBIA appeal.  This court granted a temporary stay of\r\ndeportation, and we later continued that stay conditional upon\r\nSassine filing his brief on time.  Sassine has now filed a\r\ntimely brief.  \r\n          Sassine argues only one issue on appeal.  He contends\r\nthat his BIA appeal was dismissed due to ineffective assistance\r\nof former counsel in failing to file a brief.    He does not\r\ndispute that his motion to reopen was filed outside the time\r\nlimitations imposed by 8 C.F.R.  3.2(c)(2).    However, he\r\ncontends that, where ineffective assistance of counsel in a\r\ndeportation proceeding rises to the level of a due process\r\nviolation, exceptional circumstances exist requiring the BIA to\r\nentertain a late motion to reopen.  \r\n\n   We conclude that Sassine's argument fails.  The\r\nrecord reveals that Sassine learned in mid-August 1996 that his\r\nBIA appeal was dismissed based on counsel's failure to file a\r\nbrief.  Pursuant to  3.2(c)(2), Sassine had approximately six\r\nweeks after learning of the dismissal (i.e., until September\r\n30, 1996) to file a motion to reopen.  The BIA did not receive\r\nhis motion to reopen until March 21, 1997.  Sassine makes no\r\nargument that the tardiness of his motion to reopen was due to\r\nineffective assistance of counsel.  Under the circumstances\r\n(and without expressing any opinion as to whether former\r\ncounsel was ineffective or whether ineffective assistance of\r\ncounsel might ever require the BIA to allow an untimely motion\r\nto reopen), we see no basis to set aside the decision of the\r\nBIA.\r\n   For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of\r\nthe BIA.  See Loc. R. 27.1.  The stay order is vacatedeffective on issuance of the mandate.  \r\n",
