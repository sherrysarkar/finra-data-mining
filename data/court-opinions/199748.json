This case raises an issue of\n\nimportance in the law of this circuit on Social Security\n\nappeals.   The issue is this: after an Administrative Law Judge\n\n(\"ALJ\") has erred, when is it appropriate for a court to remand\n\nfor further proceedings and when is it appropriate to order\n\npayment of social security benefits?      The Commissioner of the\n\nSocial Security Administration1 appeals from a district court\n\norder   requiring   the   Commissioner   to   pay   Clayton   Seavey\n\ndisability benefits, rather than conduct further proceedings,\n\nafter the district court found that the Social Security ALJ had\n\nerred at Step 5 of the disability determination process. Seavey\n\nv. Apfel, No. 00-23-B (D. Me. Nov. 30, 2000).       The Commissioner\n\n\n    1     In the district court proceedings, the defendant named\nwas Kenneth S. Apfel, then Commissioner of Social Security. By\nthe time this appeal was filed, Larry G. Massanari had become\nActing Commissioner of Social Security and was the appellant in\nthis case. After oral argument, Jo Anne B. Barnhart succeeded\nActing Commissioner Massanari as the Commissioner of Social\nSecurity. Pursuant to F.R.A.P. 43(c), Commissioner Barnhart is\nsubstituted as the defendant appellant.\n\n                                -2-\n\fconcedes that the ALJ decision was in error, but argues that the\n\nproper remedy was for the district court to remand the case to\n\nthe Commissioner for further administrative proceedings.           The\n\ndistrict court disposed of the case based upon a rule it had\n\nestablished in a prior case, Field v. Chater, 920 F. Supp. 240\n\n(D. Me. 1995), which adopted what appears to be either a per se\n\nor a preferential rule that when a court is faced with an error\n\nat Step 5, the appropriate remedy is an order that the applicant\n\nbe paid the benefits sought.         The issue raised here is also\n\nraised in another case we decide today, Freeman v. Barnhart, No.\n\n01-1293 (1st Cir. 2001).       We use this case to express the\n\ngeneral principles for decision.\n\n         We affirm the district court's order of remand, but\n\nreverse the order for payment of benefits, and rule that, in\n\nthis instance, remand to the Commissioner with instructions for\n\nfurther proceedings is the appropriate remedy.\n\n                                 I.\n\n         The Social Security Administration is the federal\n\nagency charged with administering both the Social Security\n\ndisability benefits program, which provides disability insurance\n\nfor covered   workers,   and   the    Supplemental   Security   Income\n\n                                -3-\n\fprogram, which provides assistance for the indigent aged and\n\ndisabled.     42 U.S.C. §§ 423, 1381a (1998).         In July 1996,\n\nClayton   Seavey   applied   for   benefits   under   both   of   these\n\nprograms, claiming that pain relating to a back injury and heart\n\nproblems rendered him unable to work. After his application was\n\ninitially denied by the Commissioner and the Commissioner denied\n\nreconsideration, Seavey received a hearing before an ALJ on\n\nAugust 13, 1997.\n\n            When considering applications, the Commissioner employs\n\na five step process to determine if an individual is disabled\n\nwithin the meaning of the Social Security Act.           20 C.F.R. §\n\n416.920 (2001).      All five steps are not applied to every\n\napplicant, as the determination may be concluded at any step\n\nalong the process.     Id.   The steps are: 1) if the applicant is\n\nengaged in substantial gainful work activity, the application is\n\ndenied; 2) if the applicant does not have, or has not had within\n\nthe relevant time period, a severe impairment or combination of\n\nimpairments, the application is denied; 3) if the impairment\n\nmeets the conditions for one of the \"listed\" impairments in the\n\nSocial Security regulations, then the application is granted; 4)\n\nif the applicant's \"residual functional capacity\" is such that\n\n                                   -4-\n\fhe or she can still perform past relevant work, then the\n\napplication is denied; 5) if the applicant, given his or her\n\nresidual functional capacity, education, work experience, and\n\nage, is unable to do any other work, the application is granted.\n\nId.\n\n         Once the applicant has met his or her burden at Step\n\n4 to show that he or she is unable to do past work due to the\n\nsignificant limitation, the Commissioner then has the burden at\n\nStep 5 of coming forward with evidence of specific jobs in the\n\nnational economy that the applicant can still perform.      Arocho\n\nv. Sec'y of Health & Human Servs., 670 F.2d 374, 375 (1st Cir.\n\n1982).    If   the   applicant's    limitations   are   exclusively\n\nexertional, then the Commissioner can meet her burden through\n\nthe use of a chart contained in the Social Security regulations.\n\n20 C.F.R. § 416.969; Medical-Vocational Guidelines, 20 C.F.R.\n\npt. 404, subpt. P, App. 2, tables 1-3 (2001), cited in 20 C.F.R.\n\n§ 416.969; Heckler v. Campbell, 461 U.S. 458 (1983).          \"The\n\nGrid,\" as it is known, consists of a matrix of the applicant's\n\nexertional capacity, age, education, and work experience.       If\n\nthe facts of the applicant's situation fit within the Grid's\n\ncategories, the Grid \"directs a conclusion as to whether the\n\n                              -5-\n\findividual is or is not disabled.\" 20   C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P,\n\nApp. 2, § 200.00(a), cited in 20 C.F.R § 416.969.    However, if\n\nthe applicant has nonexertional limitations (such as mental,\n\nsensory, or skin impairments, or environmental restrictions such\n\nas an inability to tolerate dust, id. § 200(e)) that restrict\n\nhis ability to perform jobs he would otherwise be capable of\n\nperforming, then the Grid is only a \"framework to guide [the]\n\ndecision,\" 20 C.F.R. § 416.969a(d) (2001).    See also Pratts v.\n\nChater, 94 F.3d 34, 39 (2d Cir. 1996) (discussing use of Grid\n\nwhen applicant has nonexertional limitations).\n\n         Seavey was forty-three when he applied for benefits.\n\nHis work history is that of an unskilled laborer; his education\n\nended at seventh grade.    At the ALJ hearing, Seavey presented\n\nmedical evidence concerning his back pain and the degree of\n\nlimitation it imposes on him. He also presented evidence in the\n\nform of an expert report from a psychologist, Dr. Greene.    Dr.\n\nGreene's report stated that \"Seavey appears to be a 'textbook\n\nexample' of an individual with passive-aggressive personality\n\ndisorder\" who may also meet the diagnostic criteria for avoidant\n\npersonality disorder,     and that he tested at the borderline\n\nVerbal IQ range.    Following the hearing, Seavey's attorney\n\n                               -6-\n\fsubmitted a letter from Dr. Greene,2   along with psychological\n\ntesting results, to clarify Dr. Greene's earlier findings,\n\nparticularly her notation that Seavey had an elevated score on\n\nthe \"Work Interference\" scale, indicating behavioral attributes\n\nthat would negatively affect his ability to work.      Dr. Greene's\n\nletter stated that Seavey may meet the diagnostic criteria for\n\na Reading Disorder and that \"he would have great difficulty\n\nperforming any jobs that require much reading.\"3       However, the\n\nletter also stated that Seavey's low IQ and reading ability,\n\ncombined with his desire to get the testing over with quickly,\n\nmeant that the Work Interference score might not be valid.      Dr.\n\nGreene also noted that she had not observed any problems with\n\nSeavey's   concentration,   persistence,   or   pace   during   her\n\n\n\n\n    2     At the close of the hearing, the ALJ indicated that he\nwould keep the record open until September 10, 1997.         The\nsupplemental letter from Dr. Greene is dated September 4, 1997\nand so we will assume that it was part of the record before the\nALJ. It makes little difference to the outcome, as the most\nsubstantial evidence of a nonexertional limitation is found in\nthe initial report.\n    3     Even if Seavey were illiterate, however, that would not\namount to a disability; nor is illiteracy considered to\nsignificantly limit the jobs available, even to those applicants\nwho are physically limited to sedentary work. 20 C.F.R. pt.\n404, subpt. P, App. 2, § 201.00(i).\n\n                               -7-\n\finteractions with him, and that she did not believe he would\n\n\"decompensate on the job.\"           In addition, records from one of\n\nSeavey's treating physicians indicate that he did not appear to\n\nhave       any     problems   in   understanding,   concentration,   or\n\npersistence.\n\n                 The ALJ found that Seavey is limited to \"light work\"\n\nby his back ailment.          The ALJ's decision did not mention Dr.\n\nGreene's report and letter or any psychological evidence,4 but\n\nsimply found that Seavey \"has no significant non-exertional\n\nlimitations.\"         The ALJ then used the Grid to find him to be not\n\ndisabled.          Seavey appealed to the Social Security Appeals\n\nCouncil, arguing that his mental and cognitive impairments were\n\nsignificant nonexertional limitations and therefore the Grid was\n\nnot dispositive of his claim.              Almost two years later, the\n\nAppeals Council denied his appeal.\n\n                 Seavey then sought review in federal district court.\n\nThe district judge assigned the case to a magistrate judge, who\n\nprepared a report and recommendation.           As to the Supplemental\n\nSecurity Income claim, the magistrate judge found that the ALJ\n\n       4  During the hearing, the ALJ, referring to Dr. Greene's\ninitial report, noted that \"[t]here's no evidence that there's anything\nof a disabling nature in his psychological profile in this report.\"\n\n                                     -8-\n\fhad erred by applying the Grid to Seavey after stating in the\n\nhearing that the psychological profile did not indicate anything\n\nof a \"disabling nature.\"        Seavey v. Apfel, No. 00-23-B, 2000 WL\n\n1499277, at *2 (D. Me. Oct. 6, 2000).         The correct question, the\n\nmagistrate judge's report said, is not whether the nonexertional\n\nlimitations        are   themselves    disabling,     but   whether    the\n\nnonexertional limitations significantly limit the applicant's\n\nability to perform work at a given exertional level (in Seavey's\n\ncase, \"light\" work).           Id.     If so, then the Grid is not\n\ndispositive. Id. The magistrate judge's report stated that the\n\nCommissioner bears the burden of proof at Step 5, and that when\n\nnonexertional limitations have more than a marginal effect, the\n\nCommissioner must present testimony from a vocational expert.\n\nId. at *3. Finally, the magistrate judge's report recommended\n\nthat       the   district   judge    order   the   Commissioner   to   pay\n\nSupplemental Security Income benefits to Seavey.5           Id. Although\n\nthe magistrate judge’s review of the ALJ’s decision was to\n\n\n\n       5   The magistrate judge recommended affirmance of the denial of\nSeavey's application for Social Security disability benefits because\nSeavey had not demonstrated he was disabled on or before December 31,\n1995, the last date that he was covered by Social Security disability\ninsurance. Seavey, 2000 WL 1499277, at *2. There has been no appeal\nfrom that determination, so the SSD claim has been abandoned.\n\n                                      -9-\n\fdetermine whether substantial evidence supported the findings of\n\nthe ALJ, Ward v. Commissioner of Social Security, 211 F.3d 652,\n\n655   (1st    Cir.   2000),   the   district   court’s     review   of   the\n\nmagistrate judge’s decision is de novo as to objections raised.\n\n28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(C) (1994).\n\n             The district judge agreed with the magistrate judge's\n\nreport and, in a one paragraph order, vacated the ALJ decision\n\nand ordered the Commissioner to pay benefits to Seavey.\n\n                                     II.\n\n             The Commissioner argues that, although the ALJ erred\n\nin not discussing the evidence of psychological impairment, the\n\nevidence, including Dr. Greene's report, did not necessarily\n\nestablish      the   existence      of   a   significant    nonexertional\n\nlimitation. Therefore, the Commissioner says, the ALJ's opinion\n\ncould have been affirmed in its current state on the assumption\n\nthat the ALJ had implicitly discredited Dr. Greene's letter and\n\nreport.      This argument is not persuasive because, although \"a\n\nnonexertional impairment can have a negligible effect,\" ordinarily the\n\nALJ \"must back such a finding of negligible effect with the evidence to\n\nsubstantiate it,\" Talbot v. Heckler, 814 F.2d 1456, 1465 (10th Cir.\n\n1987), unless the matter is self-evident.\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\f             Alternatively, the Commissioner argues that the proper\n\nremedy would be a remand for further administrative proceedings.\n\nShe argues that a remand with an order to pay benefits is only\n\nappropriate where the evidence shows a \"virtually certain\n\nentitlement to benefits.\"\n\n             The Commissioner further maintains that this magistrate\n\njudge has a policy of remanding with an order to pay benefits,\n\nrather than remanding for further administrative proceedings,\n\nwhenever it finds an error at Step 5 in the process.6         Counsel\n\nfor Seavey disputed that point at oral argument. The magistrate\n\njudge, in his Report and Recommendation for this case, relied\n\nupon his reasoning in a previous case, Field v. Chater, 920 F.\n\nSupp. 240 (D. Me. 1995), cited in Seavey, 2000 WL 1499277, at\n\n*3.       In Field, the magistrate judge wrote that \"[w]hen the\n\nCommissioner had a full and fair opportunity to develop the\n\nrecord and meet her burden at Step 5, there is no reason for the\n\ncourt to remand for further factfinding.\"       Field, 920 F. Supp.\n\n\n      6    The Commissioner also argues that, in this case, the ALJ\nerror was actually in Step 4, not Step 5, as nonexertional limitations\nare a component of the applicant's \"residual functional capacity,\"\nwhich is determined at Step 4. We do not see how this technicality\nwould affect the outcome of the case -- particularly since the denial\nof benefits occurred at Step 5 -- and therefore, we will not address\nthis issue.\n\n                                 -11-\n\fat 243.   The opinion in Field       distinguished that case from a\n\ndecision of this court, Rose v. Shalala, 34 F.3d 13, 19 (1st\n\nCir. 1994), in which we remanded for further proceedings because\n\nthe ALJ's error in applying the Grid at Step 5 meant that the\n\nvocational expert had not been asked the proper questions about\n\na nonexertional limitation.        Field, 920 F. Supp. at 243.    The\n\nopinion in Field emphasized that \"where the problem is . . . the\n\nmore fundamental problem of insufficient evidence on an issue\n\nfor   which   the   Commissioner    carries   the   burden,\"   further\n\nproceedings are not warranted.       Id. at 243.    In this case, the\n\nmagistrate judge looked no further than the Field case to\n\nconclude that \"the [C]ommissioner's failure to carry his burden\n\nat Step 5 requires remand for payment of benefits,\"            Seavey,\n\n2000 WL 1499277, at *3, without analyzing the differences\n\nbetween the cases.\n\n          Seavey responds that the Commissioner is simply being\n\nheld to the same standard as any other litigant in any other\n\ncase -- if he does not meet his burden, then an order to pay\n\nbenefits is appropriate.     He claims that \"[t]he Secretary who\n\nhas the benefit of institutional expertise and a huge federal\n\nbureaucracy in effect argues that no matter how egregious the\n\n                                   -12-\n\ferror they must be given one chance after another to remedy\n\ntheir mistake       unless    the    record   demonstrates       with virtual\n\ncertainty that the applicant will win on remand.\"                   In essence,\n\nSeavey     argues that the Commissioner wants an impermissible\n\nsecond bite at the apple.\n\n            The    premise     of    Seavey’s    position      is    that    the\n\nCommissioner should be treated like any other litigant and that\n\nremanding    and    allowing    new    evidence    would    be      giving   the\n\nCommissioner an unfair advantage.             The premise is not entirely\n\ncorrect.      Because    of    the    nonadversarial     nature      of    Social\n\nSecurity disability determinations, the Commissioner is not a\n\nlitigant and has no representative at the agency level. Indeed,\n\nthe model is investigatory, or inquisitorial, rather than\n\nadversarial.       Sims v. Apfel, 530 U.S. 103, 110 (2000).                 It is\n\nthe ALJ's duty to investigate and develop the facts and develop\n\nthe arguments both for and against the granting of benefits.\n\nId.      At the ALJ level, the applicant is the only litigant\n\npresenting    evidence.        While    the     agency   may   have       already\n\ngenerated evidence and the ALJ may generate more -- for example,\n\nby sending the applicant for a consultative exam or by calling\n\na medical or vocational expert -- these experts function as\n\n                                      -13-\n\fconsultants in the adjudicative process, assisting the ALJ in\n\ndetermining what the outcome should be.     They are not experts\n\nretained in an effort to shore up an agency’s litigation\n\nposition.    That is because, until the ALJ renders a decision on\n\nwhether an applicant is disabled or not, the agency has not\n\ntaken a final position.    Consequently, when an ALJ improperly\n\nconcludes that a nonexertional impairment has no significant\n\nimpact on residual functional capacity, that is an adjudicator\n\nmaking a mistake, not a party litigator failing to present\n\nevidence.\n\n                               III.\n\nStandard of Review\n\n            Judicial review of Social Security administrative\n\ndeterminations is authorized by 42 U.S.C. § 405(g) (1994). Both\n\nthe fourth and sixth sentences of this subsection grant federal\n\ncourts the power to remand cases to the Commissioner.          The\n\nfourth sentence of this subsection states that a reviewing court\n\n\"shall have power to enter, upon the pleadings and transcript of\n\nthe record, a judgment affirming, modifying, or reversing the\n\ndecision of the Commissioner of Social Security, with or without\n\nremanding the cause for a rehearing.\"    42 U.S.C. § 405(g).   The\n\n                               -14-\n\fsixth sentence states that the court \"may at any time order\n\nadditional evidence to be taken before the Commissioner of\n\nSocial Security, but only upon a showing that there is new\n\nevidence which is material and that there is good cause for the\n\nfailure to incorporate such evidence into the record in a prior\n\nproceeding.\"       Id.   As discussed below, we view this case as\n\ngoverned by the fourth sentence of § 405(g).           See Sullivan v.\n\nFinkelstein, 496 U.S. 617, 625-26 (1990); see also Shalala v.\n\nSchaefer, 509 U.S. 292, 296-97 (1993).\n\n            Our review of a district court's decision to affirm or\n\nreverse a final decision of the Commissioner is de novo and we\n\nuse   the   same    standard   to   review   the   correctness    of   the\n\nCommissioner's decision as does the district court:              that is,\n\nwhether the final decision is supported by substantial evidence\n\nand whether the correct legal standard was used.           42 U.S.C. §\n\n405(g); Ward, 211 F.3d at 655.       Questions of law are reviewed de\n\nnovo, both by the district court and by this court.         Id.; Brown\n\nv. Apfel, 71 F. Supp. 2d 28, 30 (D.R.I. 1999), aff'd, 230 F.3d\n\n1347 (1st Cir. 2000).      Since the district court appears to have\n\nadopted a rule of law as to disposition on remand, our review of\n\nthis rule is de novo.\n\n                                    -15-\n\f         Some of our sister circuits have held that, although\n\ndistrict court decisions reversing or affirming a decision of\n\nthe Commissioner are reviewed de novo, a district court's\n\ndecision as to whether to remand for proceedings or order\n\npayment once an error has been found should be reviewed only for\n\nabuse of discretion.   See Higgins v. Apfel, 222 F.3d 504, 505\n\n(8th Cir. 2000);   Harman v. Apfel, 211 F.3d 1172, 1176-78 (9th\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1038 (2000); Nelson v. Apfel, 210\n\nF.3d 799, 801-02 (7th Cir. 2000).    Seavey has urged us to adopt\n\nthis approach, and the Commissioner has not contested this point\n\nbefore us.7\n\n         However, we find that the decision as to what remedy\n\nto apply under sentence four of § 405(g) is largely dictated by\n\nthe type of error made by the ALJ or Commissioner, as discussed\n\nbelow, and therefore is not, for the most part, a matter of\n\ndiscretion.   Unlike in appeals where the district court has\n\nacted as the trial court, the district court here has no\n\n\n    7      We note that, in many of the cases holding that abuse\nof discretion is the proper standard of review, the deferential\nstandard benefitted the Commissioner, as the district court had\nordered further proceedings upon remand and the applicant was\nseeking an order for immediate payment. See Higgins, 222 F.3d\nat 505; Harman, 211 F.3d at 1174; Nelson, 210 F.3d at 801.\n\n                              -16-\n\finstitutional advantage over this court.      The district court\n\nreviews the same cold administrative record as do we, applying\n\nthe same \"substantial evidence\" test.    The First Circuit has\n\nnever recognized any distinction between the scope of a district\n\ncourt's review of Social Security determinations and the scope\n\nof appellate review.   See, e.g., Ward, 211 F.3d at 655; Nguyen\n\nv. Chater, 172 F.3d 31, 35 (1st Cir. 1999) (per curiam); Splude\n\nv. Apfel, 165 F.3d 85, 88 (1st Cir. 1999).   Similarly, under the\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act, courts of appeals directly review\n\nthe administrative action and use the same standard of review as\n\nthe district court.    Baystate Alternative Staffing, Inc. v.\n\nHerman, 163 F.3d 668, 674 (1st Cir. 1998).   We are not convinced\n\nthat we should now create an exception to this general rule for\n\ncases challenging the remand instructions when the Commissioner\n\nor ALJ has erred. Therefore, we review de novo the district\n\ncourt's decision to order payment.8\n\n\n\n    8     Even if we were to apply the abuse of discretion\nstandard, the result would be the same in this case.       The\ndistrict court's rule that an order for payment is appropriate\nwhenever the Commissioner has failed to disprove disability at\nStep 5 is an erroneous interpretation of the law; abuse of\ndiscretion review encompasses errors of law. See United States\nv. Davis, 261 F.3d 1, 21 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n                              -17-\n\f                                   IV.\n\nRemedy Upon Remand\n\n              Applying our standard of review here, we hold that the\n\ndistrict court committed error by remanding with instructions to\n\npay.       Such a result is inconsistent with our precedent and an\n\nunnecessary      abrogation   of   the    Commissioner's   authority   to\n\nadjudicate applications for disability benefits.9\n\n\n       9  Before addressing the remedial issue, we pause to note\nanother issue argued by the parties.      The magistrate judge\nassumed that at step 5 the Commissioner bears the burden of\nproof, which influenced the magistrate judge's recommendation\nfor disposition. Seavey, 2000 WL 1499277, at *3. There is,\nhowever, some dispute over who bears the burden of proof at the\nfifth step of the disability determination process.       At the\nfifth step, the Commissioner bears some type of burden to come\nforward with evidence showing that there are jobs that the\napplicant can perform despite his limitations.     However, the\nparties dispute whether this is a burden of proof or merely a\nburden of production. In a sense, this discussion relies on a\nseries of misnomers, as the Commissioner is not actually\nrepresented as a litigant. It may be better to think of this\nnot as a shifting of burdens, but rather as a rule providing\nthat the applicant is not under any obligation to produce\nevidence at Step 5.\n     This is not a new debate, see Dobrowolsky v. Califano, 606\nF.2d 403, 406 (3d Cir. 1979), but there continues to be no clear\nanswer within appellate case law. In the First Circuit, our\nterminology has not been entirely consistent. Compare Heggarty\nv. Sullivan, 947 F.2d 990, 997 (1st Cir. 1991) (per curiam)\n(referring to Agency's \"burden of proof\"), with Torres v. Sec'y\nof Health & Human Servs., 677 F.2d 167, 168 (1st Cir. 1982)\n(\"burden . . . of showing\"), Arocho, 670 F.2d at 375 (\"burden of\ncoming forward with evidence\"), and Geoffroy v. Sec'y of Health\n\n                                   -18-\n\f         The question of remedy is tied to the strictures of §\n\n405(g): “the findings of the Commissioner of Social Security as\n\nto any fact, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be\n\nconclusive.” 42 U.S.C. § 405(g). Hence, the responsibility for\n\nweighing conflicting evidence, where reasonable minds could\n\ndiffer as to the outcome, falls on the Commissioner and his\n\ndesignee, the ALJ.   Walker v. Bowen, 834 F.2d 635, 639-40 (7th\n\nCir. 1987).   It does not fall on the reviewing court.     The\n\nquestion of what instructions should accompany a remand order\n\nwill turn on the nature of the error at the ALJ proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n& Human Servs., 663 F.2d 315, 317 (1st Cir. 1981)\n(\"responsibility to establish\").\n     In most cases involving review of Social Security\nadministrative determinations, the distinction between a burden\nof proof and a burden of production will be meaningless, as our\ninquiry into the evidence (like that of the district court) is\nlimited to a determination of whether the Commissioner's\ndecision was supported by substantial evidence.     Miranda v.\nSec'y of Health, Educ. & Welfare, 514 F.2d 996, 998 (1st Cir.\n1975).   It is possible in some case that the Commissioner's\nburden may have some relevance in determining whether further\nproceedings are appropriate. Nonetheless, in this case, it is\nnot determinative.     The only evidence introduced by the\nCommissioner at Step 5 was the Grid, which was insufficient as\na matter of law to deny benefits, given that Seavey had\nintroduced evidence to support his claim that nonexertional\nlimitations significantly limited his ability to work.    Rose,\n34 F.3d at 19; Heggarty, 947 F.2d at 995-96; 20 C.F.R. §\n416.969a.\n\n                              -19-\n\f         Here, the Commissioner agrees that the ALJ was in error\n\nbecause the ALJ ignored relevant and material evidence.     The\n\nreports were relevant to show that Seavey had nonexertional\n\nlimitations that could significantly impair his ability to\n\nperform the full range of light or sedentary work and, hence,\n\nthat reliance on the Grid was inappropriate.   Rose, 34 F.3d at\n\n19; Heggarty, 947 F.2d at 995-96; 20 C.F.R. § 416.969a.     The\n\nCommissioner says that ordinarily in cases with this sort of\n\nerror, she would have voluntarily sought remand to the ALJ. The\n\nCommissioner did not do so here because, in the Commissioner's\n\nview, the court can review the record and decide that the only\n\nreasonable conclusion is that Seavey has not shown that any\n\nnonexertional limitation significantly affects his ability to\n\nperform light work, and therefore he is not disabled.   But, the\n\nCommissioner says, if the court does not agree that this is the\n\nonly reasonable conclusion, then we should send the matter back\n\nfor further proceedings.\n\n         Thus, we are confronted with a case where the ALJ did\n\nnot make any findings on a key issue -- whether Seavey has a\n\nsignificant nonexertional impairment. As a result, there was no\n\nevidence introduced on a second, subordinate issue; if the ALJ\n\n                             -20-\n\fhad    found   that   Seavey      had   a    significant,    nonexertional\n\nlimitation, he would have then progressed to a finding of\n\nwhether the combined exertional and nonexertional impairments\n\nrendered Seavey unable to perform a significant number of light\n\nor sedentary jobs.       Seavey does not advance the argument before\n\nthis court that the record, as it currently stands, conclusively\n\nshows that he is disabled under the meaning of the statute.\n\nThat would require vocational evidence to establish whether\n\nthere are jobs he could perform, given his combined exertional\n\nand nonexertional limitations.              Heggarty, 947 F.2d at 996.\n\nInstead, Seavey maintains that the Commissioner is to blame for\n\nthe insufficiency of the record, as the Commissioner failed to\n\ncall    a   vocational   expert    to   testify   at   the   hearing,   and\n\ntherefore she need not be given a second chance through further\n\nproceedings.10\n\n            Such an approach, however, is not consistent with the\n\ndictates of § 405(g) or with the approach generally taken when\n\nreviewing administrative actions. Instead, the rule we adopt is\n\n\n       10 This was not Seavey's original position before the\ndistrict court. Originally, he sought only a remand for further\nproceedings, but the magistrate judge suggested he request an\norder to pay instead.\n\n                                    -21-\n\fthat ordinarily the court can order the agency to provide the\n\nrelief    it   denied   only   in    the    unusual   case   in   which   the\n\nunderlying facts and law are such that the agency has no\n\ndiscretion to act in any manner other than to award or to deny\n\nbenefits.      Put differently, if the evidence and law compelled\n\none conclusion or the other, then the court could order an award\n\nof benefits or affirm a denial of benefits.                  For example, a\n\njudicial award of benefits would be proper where the proof of\n\ndisability is overwhelming or where the proof is very strong and\n\nthere is no contrary evidence.         See Mowery v. Heckler, 771 F.2d\n\n966, 973 (6th Cir. 1985).           Similarly, if correcting the legal\n\nerror clarified the record sufficiently that an award or denial\n\nof benefits was the clear outcome, then the court may order\n\npayment or affirm denial.       Conversely, if an essential factual\n\nissue has not been resolved, as here, and there is no clear\n\nentitlement to benefits, the court must remand for further\n\nproceedings.11    A number of circuits appear to have adopted this\n\n\n\n     11   If the district court remands to the agency for further\nproceedings where the applicant has sought payment of benefits\nand has requested a remand for further proceedings only as an\nalternative remedy, the applicant may appeal that remand order\nto this court. Forney v. Apfel, 524 U.S. 266, 271 (1998).\n\n                                     -22-\n\fview.       See Holohan v. Massanari, 246 F.3d 1195, 1210 (9th Cir.\n\n2001) (\"[A] remand for further proceedings is unnecessary if the\n\nrecord is fully developed and it is clear from the record that\n\nthe ALJ would be required to award benefits.\");                   Faucher v.\n\nSec'y of Health & Human Servs., 17 F.3d 171, 176 (6th Cir. 1994)\n\n(improper for district court to award benefits where there is\n\nconflicting      evidence     as   to     the   severity    of    applicant's\n\nimpairment); Davis v. Shalala, 985 F.2d 528, 534 (11th Cir.\n\n1993) (\"This court . . . [may] remand the case for an entry of\n\nan order awarding disability benefits where the Secretary has\n\nalready considered the essential evidence and it is clear that\n\nthe cumulative effect of the evidence establishes disability\n\nwithout any doubt.\"); see also Nielson v. Sullivan, 992 F.2d\n\n1118, 1122 (10th Cir. 1993) (remand with order to pay where\n\npassage of time had placed applicant in an older age group,\n\nmaking award a foregone conclusion); K.C. Davis & R.J. Pierce\n\nJr.,    2    Administrative    Law      Treatise   163-64   (3d    ed.   1994)\n\n(adopting test but adding requirement that the court conclude\n\nthat further delay would harm the applicant).\n\n              This rule also is consistent with the general rules for\n\njudicial review of administrative action.              When an agency has\n\n                                     -23-\n\fnot considered all relevant factors in taking action, or has\n\nprovided insufficient explanation for its action, the reviewing\n\ncourt ordinarily should remand the case to the agency.              Fla.\n\nPower & Light Co. v. Lorion, 470 U.S. 729, 744 (1985) (\"If the\n\nrecord before the agency does not support the agency action . . . the\n\nproper course, except in rare circumstances, is to remand to the agency\n\nfor additional investigation or explanation.\").\n\n     The district court's and the magistrate judge's decisions\n\nrest, in part, on the erroneous conclusion that the Commissioner\n\nwould not be able to supplement a record upon remand, absent a\n\nshowing of \"good cause\" for failure to introduce the necessary\n\nvocational evidence at the ALJ hearing, and therefore a remand\n\nwould not serve any purpose.     See Field v. Chater, 920 F. Supp.\n\n240, 244 (D. Me. 1995).     However, this reasoning depends on two\n\nincorrect   assumptions.     First,     it   assumes   that   additional\n\nevidence is definitively needed. Additional evidence would only\n\nbe necessary in this case if the ALJ determines that Seavey's\n\nevidence indicates a significant nonexertional limitation.12\n\n\n     12   At this stage, we make no determination as to whether an ALJ\nfinding that the evidence was sufficient to show a significant\nnonexertional limitation, or a finding that the evidence was not\nsufficient to show a significant nonexertional limitation, would meet\nthe \"substantial evidence\" test.\n\n                                 -24-\n\fWithout that preliminary finding, we cannot know whether the\n\ndenial   of   benefits    can   withstand       the   lack     of   vocational\n\nevidence.\n\n    Second,     the     magistrate     judge's    and       district     court's\n\nreasoning     assumes    that   good    cause    is     a   requirement     for\n\nintroducing new evidence in a sentence four remand.                    The \"good\n\ncause\" concept is derived from the sixth sentence of § 405(g),\n\nquoted above.      Field, 920 F. Supp. at 244.                The magistrate\n\njudge's recommendation also relies on older Second Circuit\n\nprecedent, which also employs the \"good cause\" reasoning in\n\ndetermining when orders to pay are appropriate. Id. at 242\n\n(citing Carroll v. Sec'y of Health & Human Servs., 705 F.2d 638,\n\n643-44 (2d Cir. 1983)).         However, this reasoning erroneously\n\ncombines two separate grants of remand power contained within §\n\n405(g) -- that granted by the fourth sentence and that granted\n\nby the sixth sentence.           Since the Second Circuit decided\n\nCarroll, the Supreme Court has made clear that the sixth\n\nsentence of § 405(g) and the fourth sentence of § 405(g) are two\n\ndistinct grants of remand power, which apply in two distinct\n\nsituations.    Shalala v. Schaefer, 509 U.S. 292, 297-301 (1993);\n\nSullivan v. Finkelstein, 496 U.S. 617, 626 (1990). Sentence six\n\n                                     -25-\n\fand its \"good cause\" limitation come into play only \"when the\n\ndistrict court learns of evidence not in existence or available\n\nto the applicant at the time of the administrative proceeding\n\nthat   might     have   changed    the   outcome   of   that      proceeding.\"\n\nFinkelstein, 496 U.S. at 626. Sentence six has been referred to\n\nas a \"pre-judgment remand,\" employed where the federal court has\n\nnot ruled on the validity of the Commissioner's position, while\n\nsentence four has been referred to as a \"post-judgment remand.\"\n\nSee Faucher v. Sec'y of Health & Human Servs., 17 F.3d 171, 175\n\n(6th Cir. 1994). This case is clearly governed by sentence four\n\nand therefore the \"good cause\" restriction of sentence six does\n\nnot apply.\n\n       Unlike sentence six, sentence four does not contain any\n\nstatutory limits on the ability to supplement the record on\n\nremand. Nonetheless, we do not rule out the possibility of some\n\nconstraints in unusual cases.            In some Social Security cases,\n\nfor example, the delay in final disposition of claims may, at\n\ntimes,    make    requests    by   the    Commissioner      for     additional\n\nproceedings a matter of some concern.              Many Social Security\n\napplicants       are    represented      by   non-lawyers      or    have   no\n\n\n\n                                      -26-\n\frepresentation at all, and most are indigent.13         Some circuits\n\nhave exercised what we view as a form of equitable power to\n\norder benefits in cases where the entitlement is not totally\n\nclear, but the delay involved in repeated remands has become\n\nunconscionable.   E.g., Morales v. Apfel, 225 F.3d 310, 320 (3d\n\nCir. 2000) (remanding for payment of benefits in light of\n\n\"substantial   evidence\"   of    a   severe   mental   disability   and\n\n\"considerable inexplicable delays\" resulting in passage of ten\n\nyears since application).       In such cases, our sister circuits\n\nhave warned the Commissioner that administrative deference does\n\nnot entitle the Commissioner to endless opportunities to get it\n\nright.14   See, e.g., Miller v. Chater, 99 F.3d 972, 978 (10th\n\n\n     13   Moreover, as representatives are commonly paid for\ntheir advocacy during the agency adjudication with a percentage\nof the lump sum retroactive benefit payment that applicants\nreceive when their applications are approved, see 42 U.S.C. §\n406(a)(2)(A) (1994), there is little financial incentive for the\nagency or the representative to expedite agency proceedings. We\ndo note that the Equal Access to Justice Act, under which the\nCommissioner may be compelled to pay the attorney's fees and\nexpenses of successful applicants, Schaefer, 509 U.S. at 302-03,\nprovides an incentive to the agency not to take unreasonable\npositions on appeal.\n     14   At the same time, the Supreme Court has noted that Congress\nwas fully aware of the serious delays in resolution of disability\nclaims, yet declined to impose deadlines; as a result, the Court\nvacated an injunction imposing a flat deadline. Heckler v. Day, 467\nU.S. 104 (1984).\n\n                                 -27-\n\fCir. 1996) (remanding for fifth administrative hearing, but\n\ncautioning \"the agency that the Secretary is not entitled to\n\nadjudicate a case ad infinitum until [she] correctly applies the\n\nproper legal standard and gathers evidence to support [her]\n\nconclusion.\") (internal quotations omitted).       This, however, is\n\nnot such a case, and we need not decide the extent of any such\n\nequitable limits here.      In this case, we leave the question of\n\nadditional evidence to the discretion of the ALJ, based on his\n\nresolution     of   the   conflicting   evidence   of   nonexertional\n\nimpairments.\n\n    Accordingly, the order for payment of benefits is vacated\n\nand the case is remanded with instructions to remand to the\n\nCommissioner for further proceedings not inconsistent with this\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -28-\n\f",

The issue is this: after an Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") has erred, when is it appropriate for a court to remand for further proceedings and when is it appropriate to order payment of social security benefits? The Commissioner of the Social Security Administration<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> appeals from a district court order requiring the Commissioner to pay Clayton Seavey disability benefits, rather than conduct further proceedings, after the district court found that the Social Security ALJ had erred at Step 5 of the disability determination process. Seavey v. Apfel, No. 00-23-B (D. Me. Nov. 30, 2000). The Commissioner concedes that the ALJ decision was in error, but argues that the proper remedy was for the district court to remand the case to the Commissioner for further administrative proceedings. The district court disposed of the case based upon a rule it had established in a prior case, Field v. Chater, 920 F. Supp. 240 (D. Me. 1995), which adopted what appears to be either a per se or a preferential rule that when a court is faced with an error at Step 5, the appropriate remedy is an order that the applicant be paid the benefits sought. The issue raised here is also raised in another case we decide today, Freeman v. Barnhart, No. 01-1293 (1st Cir. 2001).

In July 1996, Clayton Seavey applied for benefits under both of these programs, claiming that pain relating to a back injury and heart problems rendered him unable to work. After his application was initially denied by the Commissioner and the Commissioner denied reconsideration, Seavey received a hearing before an ALJ on August 13, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When considering applications, the Commissioner employs a five step process to determine if an individual is disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act. 20 C.F.R. &#167; 416.920 (2001). All five steps are not applied to every applicant, as the determination may be concluded at any step along the process. Id. The steps are: 1) if the applicant is engaged in substantial gainful work activity, the application is denied; 2) if the applicant does not have, or has not had within the relevant time period, a severe impairment or combination of impairments, the application is denied; 3) if the impairment meets the conditions for one of the \"listed\" impairments in the Social Security regulations, then the application is granted; 4) if the applicant's \"residual functional capacity\" is such that he or she can still perform past relevant work, then the application is denied; 5) if the applicant, given his or her residual functional capacity, education, work experience, and age, is unable to do any other work, the application is granted. Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the applicant has met his or her burden at Step 4 to show that he or she is unable to do past work due to the significant limitation, the Commissioner then has the burden at Step 5 of coming forward with evidence of specific jobs in the national economy that the applicant can still perform. Arocho v. Sec'y of Health &amp; Human Servs., 670 F.2d 374, 375 (1st Cir. 1982). If the applicant's limitations are exclusively exertional, then the Commissioner can meet her burden through the use of a chart contained in the Social Security regulations. 20 C.F.R. &#167; 416.969; Medical-Vocational Guidelines, 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, App. 2, tables 1-3 (2001), cited in 20 C.F.R. &#167; 416.969; Heckler v. Campbell, 461 U.S. 458 (1983). \"The Grid,\" as it is known, consists of a matrix of the applicant's exertional capacity, age, education, and work experience. If the facts of the applicant's situation fit within the Grid's categories, the Grid \"directs a conclusion as to whether the individual is or is not disabled.\" 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, App. 2, &#167; 200.00(a), cited in 20 C.F.R &#167; 416.969. However, if the applicant has nonexertional limitations (such as mental, sensory, or skin impairments, or environmental restrictions such as an inability to tolerate dust, id. &#167; 200(e)) that restrict his ability to perform jobs he would otherwise be capable of performing, then the Grid is only a \"framework to guide [the] decision,\" 20 C.F.R. &#167; 416.969a(d) (2001). See also Pratts v. Chater, 94 F.3d 34, 39 (2d Cir. 1996) (discussing use of Grid when applicant has nonexertional limitations).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seavey was forty-three when he applied for benefits. His work history is that of an unskilled laborer; his education ended at seventh grade. At the ALJ hearing, Seavey presented medical evidence concerning his back pain and the degree of limitation it imposes on him. He also presented evidence in the form of an expert report from a psychologist, Dr. Greene. Dr. Greene's report stated that \"Seavey appears to be a 'textbook example' of an individual with passive-aggressive personality disorder\" who may also meet the diagnostic criteria for avoidant personality disorder, and that he tested at the borderline Verbal IQ range. Following the hearing, Seavey's attorney submitted a letter from Dr. Greene,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> along with psychological testing results, to clarify Dr. Greene's earlier findings, particularly her notation that Seavey had an elevated score on the \"Work Interference\" scale, indicating behavioral attributes that would negatively affect his ability to work. Dr. Greene's letter stated that Seavey may meet the diagnostic criteria for a Reading Disorder and that \"he would have great difficulty performing any jobs that require much reading.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> However, the letter also stated that Seavey's low IQ and reading ability, combined with his desire to get the testing over with quickly, meant that the Work Interference score might not be valid. Dr. Greene also noted that she had not observed any problems with Seavey's concentration, persistence, or pace during her interactions with him, and that she did not believe he would \"decompensate on the job.\" In addition, records from one of Seavey's treating physicians indicate that he did not appear to have any problems in understanding, concentration, or persistence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ found that Seavey is limited to \"light work\" by his back ailment. The ALJ's decision did not mention Dr. Greene's report and letter or any psychological evidence,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> but simply found that Seavey \"has no significant non-exertional limitations.\" The ALJ then used the Grid to find him to be not disabled. Seavey appealed to the Social Security Appeals Council, arguing that his mental and cognitive impairments were significant nonexertional limitations and therefore the Grid was not dispositive of his claim. Almost two years later, the Appeals Council denied his appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seavey then sought review in federal district court. The district judge assigned the case to a magistrate judge, who prepared a report and recommendation. As to the Supplemental Security Income claim, the magistrate judge found that the ALJ had erred by applying the Grid to Seavey after stating in the hearing that the psychological profile did not indicate anything of a \"disabling nature.\" Seavey v. Apfel, No. 00-23-B, 2000 WL 1499277, at *2 (D. Me. Oct. 6, 2000). The correct question, the magistrate judge's report said, is not whether the nonexertional limitations are themselves disabling, but whether the nonexertional limitations significantly limit the applicant's ability to perform work at a given exertional level (in Seavey's case, \"light\" work). Id. If so, then the Grid is not dispositive. Id. The magistrate judge's report stated that the Commissioner bears the burden of proof at Step 5, and that when nonexertional limitations have more than a marginal effect, the Commissioner must present testimony from a vocational expert. Id. at *3. Finally, the magistrate judge's report recommended that the district judge order the Commissioner to pay Supplemental Security Income benefits to Seavey.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Id. Although the magistrate judge's review of the ALJ's decision was to determine whether substantial evidence supported the findings of the ALJ, Ward v. Commissioner of Social Security, 211 F.3d 652, 655 (1st Cir. 2000), the district court's review of the magistrate judge's decision is de novo as to objections raised. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 636(b)(1)(C) (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge agreed with the magistrate judge's report and, in a one paragraph order, vacated the ALJ decision and ordered the Commissioner to pay benefits to Seavey.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commissioner argues that, although the ALJ erred in not discussing the evidence of psychological impairment, the evidence, including Dr. Greene's report, did not necessarily establish the existence of a significant nonexertional limitation. Therefore, the Commissioner says, the ALJ's opinion could have been affirmed in its current state on the assumption that the ALJ had implicitly discredited Dr. Greene's letter and report. This argument is not persuasive because, although \"a nonexertional impairment can have a negligible effect,\" ordinarily the ALJ \"must back such a finding of negligible effect with the evidence to substantiate it,\" Talbot v. Heckler, 814 F.2d 1456, 1465 (10th Cir. 1987), unless the matter is self-evident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, the Commissioner argues that the proper remedy would be a remand for further administrative proceedings. She argues that a remand with an order to pay benefits is only appropriate where the evidence shows a \"virtually certain entitlement to benefits.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commissioner further maintains that this magistrate judge has a policy of remanding with an order to pay benefits, rather than remanding for further administrative proceedings, whenever it finds an error at Step 5 in the process.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Counsel for Seavey disputed that point at oral argument. The magistrate judge, in his Report and Recommendation for this case, relied upon his reasoning in a previous case, Field v. Chater, 920 F. Supp. 240 (D. Me. 1995), cited in Seavey, 2000 WL 1499277, at *3. In Field, the magistrate judge wrote that \"[w]hen the Commissioner had a full and fair opportunity to develop the record and meet her burden at Step 5, there is no reason for the court to remand for further factfinding.\" Field, 920 F. Supp. at 243. The opinion in Field distinguished that case from a decision of this court, Rose v. Shalala, 34 F.3d 13, 19 (1st Cir. 1994), in which we remanded for further proceedings because the ALJ's error in applying the Grid at Step 5 meant that the vocational expert had not been asked the proper questions about a nonexertional limitation. Field, 920 F. Supp. at 243. The opinion in Field emphasized that \"where the problem is . . . the more fundamental problem of insufficient evidence on an issue for which the Commissioner carries the burden,\" further proceedings are not warranted. Id. at 243. In this case, the magistrate judge looked no further than the Field case to conclude that \"the [C]ommissioner's failure to carry his burden at Step 5 requires remand for payment of benefits,\" Seavey, 2000 WL 1499277, at *3, without analyzing the differences between the cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seavey responds that the Commissioner is simply being held to the same standard as any other litigant in any other case -- if he does not meet his burden, then an order to pay benefits is appropriate. He claims that \"[t]he Secretary who has the benefit of institutional expertise and a huge federal bureaucracy in effect argues that no matter how egregious the error they must be given one chance after another to remedy their mistake unless the record demonstrates with virtual certainty that the applicant will win on remand.\" In essence, Seavey argues that the Commissioner wants an impermissible second bite at the apple.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The premise of Seavey's position is that the Commissioner should be treated like any other litigant and that remanding and allowing new evidence would be giving the Commissioner an unfair advantage. The premise is not entirely correct. Because of the nonadversarial nature of Social Security disability determinations, the Commissioner is not a litigant and has no representative at the agency level. Indeed, the model is investigatory, or inquisitorial, rather than adversarial. Sims v. Apfel, 530 U.S. 103, 110 (2000). It is the ALJ's duty to investigate and develop the facts and develop the arguments both for and against the granting of benefits. Id. At the ALJ level, the applicant is the only litigant presenting evidence. While the agency may have already generated evidence and the ALJ may generate more -- for example, by sending the applicant for a consultative exam or by calling a medical or vocational expert -- these experts function as consultants in the adjudicative process, assisting the ALJ in determining what the outcome should be. They are not experts retained in an effort to shore up an agency's litigation position. That is because, until the ALJ renders a decision on whether an applicant is disabled or not, the agency has not taken a final position. Consequently, when an ALJ improperly concludes that a nonexertional impairment has no significant impact on residual functional capacity, that is an adjudicator making a mistake, not a party litigator failing to present evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judicial review of Social Security administrative determinations is authorized by 42 U.S.C. &#167; 405(g) (1994). Both the fourth and sixth sentences of this subsection grant federal courts the power to remand cases to the Commissioner. The fourth sentence of this subsection states that a reviewing court \"shall have power to enter, upon the pleadings and transcript of the record, a judgment affirming, modifying, or reversing the decision of the Commissioner of Social Security, with or without remanding the cause for a rehearing.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 405(g). The sixth sentence states that the court \"may at any time order additional evidence to be taken before the Commissioner of Social Security, but only upon a showing that there is new evidence which is material and that there is good cause for the failure to incorporate such evidence into the record in a prior proceeding.\" Id. As discussed below, we view this case as governed by the fourth sentence of &#167; 405(g). See Sullivan v. Finkelstein, 496 U.S. 617, 625-26 (1990); see also Shalala v. Schaefer, 509 U.S. 292, 296-97 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of a district court's decision to affirm or reverse a final decision of the Commissioner is de novo and we use the same standard to review the correctness of the Commissioner's decision as does the district court: that is, whether the final decision is supported by substantial evidence and whether the correct legal standard was used. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 405(g); Ward, 211 F.3d at 655. Questions of law are reviewed de novo, both by the district court and by this court. Id.; Brown v. Apfel, 71 F. Supp. 2d 28, 30 (D.R.I. 1999), aff'd, 230 F.3d 1347 (1st Cir. 2000). Since the district court appears to have adopted a rule of law as to disposition on remand, our review of this rule is de novo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some of our sister circuits have held that, although district court decisions reversing or affirming a decision of the Commissioner are reviewed de novo, a district court's decision as to whether to remand for proceedings or order payment once an error has been found should be reviewed only for abuse of discretion. See Higgins v. Apfel, 222 F.3d 504, 505 (8th Cir. 2000); Harman v. Apfel, 211 F.3d 1172, 1176-78 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1038 (2000); Nelson v. Apfel, 210 F.3d 799, 801-02 (7th Cir. 2000). Seavey has urged us to adopt this approach, and the Commissioner has not contested this point before us.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, we find that the decision as to what remedy to apply under sentence four of &#167; 405(g) is largely dictated by the type of error made by the ALJ or Commissioner, as discussed below, and therefore is not, for the most part, a matter of discretion. Unlike in appeals where the district court has acted as the trial court, the district court here has no institutional advantage over this court. The district court reviews the same cold administrative record as do we, applying the same \"substantial evidence\" test. The First Circuit has never recognized any distinction between the scope of a district court's review of Social Security determinations and the scope of appellate review. See, e.g., Ward, 211 F.3d at 655; Nguyen v. Chater, 172 F.3d 31, 35 (1st Cir. 1999) (per curiam); Splude v. Apfel, 165 F.3d 85, 88 (1st Cir. 1999). Similarly, under the Administrative Procedure Act, courts of appeals directly review the administrative action and use the same standard of review as the district court. Baystate Alternative Staffing, Inc. v. Herman, 163 F.3d 668, 674 (1st Cir. 1998). We are not convinced that we should now create an exception to this general rule for cases challenging the remand instructions when the Commissioner or ALJ has erred. Therefore, we review de novo the district court's decision to order payment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Remedy Upon Remand</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying our standard of review here, we hold that the district court committed error by remanding with instructions to pay. Such a result is inconsistent with our precedent and an unnecessary abrogation of the Commissioner's authority to adjudicate applications for disability benefits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question of remedy is tied to the strictures of &#167; 405(g): \"the findings of the Commissioner of Social Security as to any fact, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 405(g). Hence, the responsibility for weighing conflicting evidence, where reasonable minds could differ as to the outcome, falls on the Commissioner and his designee, the ALJ. Walker v. Bowen, 834 F.2d 635, 639-40 (7th Cir. 1987). It does not fall on the reviewing court. The question of what instructions should accompany a remand order will turn on the nature of the error at the ALJ proceedings. Here, the Commissioner agrees that the ALJ was in error because the ALJ ignored relevant and material evidence. The reports were relevant to show that Seavey had nonexertional limitations that could significantly impair his ability to perform the full range of light or sedentary work and, hence, that reliance on the Grid was inappropriate. Rose, 34 F.3d at 19; Heggarty, 947 F.2d at 995-96; 20 C.F.R. &#167; 416.969a. The Commissioner says that ordinarily in cases with this sort of error, she would have voluntarily sought remand to the ALJ. The Commissioner did not do so here because, in the Commissioner's view, the court can review the record and decide that the only reasonable conclusion is that Seavey has not shown that any nonexertional limitation significantly affects his ability to perform light work, and therefore he is not disabled. But, the Commissioner says, if the court does not agree that this is the only reasonable conclusion, then we should send the matter back for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we are confronted with a case where the ALJ did not make any findings on a key issue -- whether Seavey has a significant nonexertional impairment. As a result, there was no evidence introduced on a second, subordinate issue; if the ALJ had found that Seavey had a significant, nonexertional limitation, he would have then progressed to a finding of whether the combined exertional and nonexertional impairments rendered Seavey unable to perform a significant number of light or sedentary jobs. Seavey does not advance the argument before this court that the record, as it currently stands, conclusively shows that he is disabled under the meaning of the statute. That would require vocational evidence to establish whether there are jobs he could perform, given his combined exertional and nonexertional limitations. Heggarty, 947 F.2d at 996. Instead, Seavey maintains that the Commissioner is to blame for the insufficiency of the record, as the Commissioner failed to call a vocational expert to testify at the hearing, and therefore she need not be given a second chance through further proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such an approach, however, is not consistent with the dictates of &#167; 405(g) or with the approach generally taken when reviewing administrative actions. Instead, the rule we adopt is that ordinarily the court can order the agency to provide the relief it denied only in the unusual case in which the underlying facts and law are such that the agency has no discretion to act in any manner other than to award or to deny benefits. Put differently, if the evidence and law compelled one conclusion or the other, then the court could order an award of benefits or affirm a denial of benefits. For example, a judicial award of benefits would be proper where the proof of disability is overwhelming or where the proof is very strong and there is no contrary evidence. See Mowery v. Heckler, 771 F.2d 966, 973 (6th Cir. 1985). Similarly, if correcting the legal error clarified the record sufficiently that an award or denial of benefits was the clear outcome, then the court may order payment or affirm denial. Conversely, if an essential factual issue has not been resolved, as here, and there is no clear entitlement to benefits, the court must remand for further proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> A number of circuits appear to have adopted this view. See Holohan v. Massanari, 246 F.3d 1195, 1210 (9th Cir. 2001) (\"[A] remand for further proceedings is unnecessary if the record is fully developed and it is clear from the record that the ALJ would be required to award benefits.\"); Faucher v. Sec'y of Health &amp; Human Servs., 17 F.3d 171, 176 (6th Cir. 1994) (improper for district court to award benefits where there is conflicting evidence as to the severity of applicant's impairment); Davis v. Shalala, 985 F.2d 528, 534 (11th Cir. 1993) (\"This court . . . [may] remand the case for an entry of an order awarding disability benefits where the Secretary has already considered the essential evidence and it is clear that the cumulative effect of the evidence establishes disability without any doubt.\"); see also Nielson v. Sullivan, 992 F.2d 1118, 1122 (10th Cir. 1993) (remand with order to pay where passage of time had placed applicant in an older age group, making award a foregone conclusion); K.C. Davis &amp; R.J. Pierce Jr., 2 Administrative Law Treatise 163-64 (3d ed. 1994) (adopting test but adding requirement that the court conclude that further delay would harm the applicant).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This rule also is consistent with the general rules for judicial review of administrative action. When an agency has not considered all relevant factors in taking action, or has provided insufficient explanation for its action, the reviewing court ordinarily should remand the case to the agency. Fla. Power &amp; Light Co. v. Lorion, 470 U.S. 729, 744 (1985) (\"If the record before the agency does not support the agency action . . . the proper course, except in rare circumstances, is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's and the magistrate judge's decisions rest, in part, on the erroneous conclusion that the Commissioner would not be able to supplement a record upon remand, absent a showing of \"good cause\" for failure to introduce the necessary vocational evidence at the ALJ hearing, and therefore a remand would not serve any purpose. See Field v. Chater, 920 F. Supp. 240, 244 (D. Me. 1995). However, this reasoning depends on two incorrect assumptions. First, it assumes that additional evidence is definitively needed. Additional evidence would only be necessary in this case if the ALJ determines that Seavey's evidence indicates a significant nonexertional limitation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Without that preliminary finding, we cannot know whether the denial of benefits can withstand the lack of vocational evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the magistrate judge's and district court's reasoning assumes that good cause is a requirement for introducing new evidence in a sentence four remand. The \"good cause\" concept is derived from the sixth sentence of &#167; 405(g), quoted above. Field, 920 F. Supp. at 244. The magistrate judge's recommendation also relies on older Second Circuit precedent, which also employs the \"good cause\" reasoning in determining when orders to pay are appropriate. Id. at 242 (citing Carroll v. Sec'y of Health &amp; Human Servs., 705 F.2d 638, 643-44 (2d Cir. 1983)). However, this reasoning erroneously combines two separate grants of remand power contained within &#167; 405(g) -- that granted by the fourth sentence and that granted by the sixth sentence. Since the Second Circuit decided Carroll, the Supreme Court has made clear that the sixth sentence of &#167; 405(g) and the fourth sentence of &#167; 405(g) are two distinct grants of remand power, which apply in two distinct situations. Shalala v. Schaefer, 509 U.S. 292, 297-301 (1993); Sullivan v. Finkelstein, 496 U.S. 617, 626 (1990). Sentence six and its \"good cause\" limitation come into play only \"when the district court learns of evidence not in existence or available to the applicant at the time of the administrative proceeding that might have changed the outcome of that proceeding.\" Finkelstein, 496 U.S. at 626. Sentence six has been referred to as a \"pre-judgment remand,\" employed where the federal court has not ruled on the validity of the Commissioner's position, while sentence four has been referred to as a \"post-judgment remand.\" See Faucher v. Sec'y of Health &amp; Human Servs., 17 F.3d 171, 175 (6th Cir. 1994). This case is clearly governed by sentence four and therefore the \"good cause\" restriction of sentence six does not apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike sentence six, sentence four does not contain any statutory limits on the ability to supplement the record on remand. Nonetheless, we do not rule out the possibility of some constraints in unusual cases. In some Social Security cases, for example, the delay in final disposition of claims may, at times, make requests by the Commissioner for additional proceedings a matter of some concern. Many Social Security applicants are represented by non-lawyers or have no representation at all, and most are indigent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> Some circuits have exercised what we view as a form of equitable power to order benefits in cases where the entitlement is not totally clear, but the delay involved in repeated remands has become unconscionable. E.g., Morales v. Apfel, 225 F.3d 310, 320 (3d Cir. 2000) (remanding for payment of benefits in light of \"substantial evidence\" of a severe mental disability and \"considerable inexplicable delays\" resulting in passage of ten years since application). In such cases, our sister circuits have warned the Commissioner that administrative deference does not entitle the Commissioner to endless opportunities to get it right.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> See, e.g., Miller v. Chater, 99 F.3d 972, 978 (10th Cir. 1996) (remanding for fifth administrative hearing, but cautioning \"the agency that the Secretary is not entitled to adjudicate a case ad infinitum until [she] correctly applies the proper legal standard and gathers evidence to support [her] conclusion.\") (internal quotations omitted). This, however, is not such a case, and we need not decide the extent of any such equitable limits here. In this case, we leave the question of additional evidence to the discretion of the ALJ, based on his resolution of the conflicting evidence of nonexertional impairments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the order for payment of benefits is vacated and the case is remanded with instructions to remand to the Commissioner for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p>  Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  In the district court proceedings, the defendant named was Kenneth S.

The district court's rule that an order for payment is appropriate whenever the Commissioner has failed to disprove disability at Step 5 is an erroneous interpretation of the law; abuse of discretion review encompasses errors of law. See United States v.

The magistrate judge assumed that at step 5 the Commissioner bears the burden of proof, which influenced the magistrate judge's recommendation for disposition. Seavey, 2000 WL 1499277, at *3. There is, however, some dispute over who bears the burden of proof at the fifth step of the disability determination process. At the fifth step, the Commissioner bears some type of burden to come forward with evidence showing that there are jobs that the applicant can perform despite his limitations. However, the parties dispute whether this is a burden of proof or merely a burden of production. In a sense, this discussion relies on a series of misnomers, as the Commissioner is not actually represented as a litigant. It may be better to think of this not as a shifting of burdens, but rather as a rule providing that the applicant is not under any obligation to produce evidence at Step 5.</p>\n        <p>This is not a new debate, see Dobrowolsky v. Califano, 606 F.2d 403, 406 (3d Cir. 1979), but there continues to be no clear answer within appellate case law. In the First Circuit, our terminology has not been entirely consistent. Compare Heggarty v. Sullivan, 947 F.2d 990, 997 (1st Cir. 1991) (per curiam) (referring to Agency's \"burden of proof\"), with Torres v. Sec'y of Health &amp; Human Servs., 677 F.2d 167, 168 (1st Cir. 1982) (\"burden . . . of showing\"), Arocho, 670 F.2d at 375 (\"burden of coming forward with evidence\"), and Geoffroy v. Sec'y of Health &amp; Human Servs., 663 F.2d 315, 317 (1st Cir. 1981) (\"responsibility to establish\").</p>\n        <p>In most cases involving review of Social Security administrative determinations, the distinction between a burden of proof and a burden of production will be meaningless, as our inquiry into the evidence (like that of the district court) is limited to a determination of whether the Commissioner's decision was supported by substantial evidence. Miranda v. Sec'y of Health, Educ. &amp; Welfare, 514 F.2d 996, 998 (1st Cir. 1975). It is possible in some case that the Commissioner's burden may have some relevance in determining whether further proceedings are appropriate. Nonetheless, in this case, it is not determinative. The only evidence introduced by the Commissioner at Step 5 was the Grid, which was insufficient as a matter of law to deny benefits, given that Seavey had introduced evidence to support his claim that nonexertional limitations significantly limited his ability to work. Rose, 34 F.3d at 19; Heggarty, 947 F.2d at 995-96; 20 C.F.R. &#167; 416.969a.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p>  This was not Seavey's original position before the district court.

We do note that the Equal Access to Justice Act, under which the Commissioner may be compelled to pay the attorney's fees and expenses of successful applicants, Schaefer, 509 U.S. at 302-03, provides an incentive to the agency not to take unreasonable positions on appeal.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p>  At the same time, the Supreme Court has noted that Congress was fully aware of the serious delays in resolution of disability claims, yet declined to impose deadlines; as a result, the Court vacated an injunction imposing a flat deadline.

The issue is this: after an Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") has erred, when is it appropriate for a court to remand for further proceedings and when is it appropriate to order payment of social security benefits? The Commissioner of the Social Security Administration<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> appeals from a district court order requiring the Commissioner to pay Clayton Seavey disability benefits, rather than conduct further proceedings, after the district court found that the Social Security ALJ had erred at Step 5 of the disability determination process. Seavey v. Apfel, No. 00-23-B (D. Me. Nov. 30, 2000). The Commissioner concedes that the ALJ decision was in error, but argues that the proper remedy was for the district court to remand the case to the Commissioner for further administrative proceedings. The district court disposed of the case based upon a rule it had established in a prior case, Field v. Chater, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1461513\"><a href=\"/opinion/1461513/field-v-chater/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">240</span></a></span> (D. Me. 1995), which adopted what appears to be either a per se or a preferential rule that when a court is faced with an error at Step 5, the appropriate remedy is an order that the applicant be paid the benefits sought. The issue raised here is also raised in another case we decide today, Freeman v. Barnhart, No. 01-1293 (1st Cir. 2001). We use this case to express the general principles for decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the district court's order of remand, but reverse the order for payment of benefits, and rule that, in this instance, remand to the Commissioner with instructions for further proceedings is the appropriate remedy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Social Security Administration is the federal agency charged with administering both the Social Security disability benefits program, which provides disability insurance for covered workers, and the Supplemental Security Income program, which provides assistance for the indigent aged and disabled. 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 423, 1381a (1998). In July 1996, Clayton Seavey applied for benefits under both of these programs, claiming that pain relating to a back injury and heart problems rendered him unable to work. After his application was initially denied by the Commissioner and the Commissioner denied reconsideration, Seavey received a hearing before an ALJ on August 13, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When considering applications, the Commissioner employs a five step process to determine if an individual is disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act. 20 C.F.R. &#167; 416.920 (2001). All five steps are not applied to every applicant, as the determination may be concluded at any step along the process. Id. The steps are: 1) if the applicant is engaged in substantial gainful work activity, the application is denied; 2) if the applicant does not have, or has not had within the relevant time period, a severe impairment or combination of impairments, the application is denied; 3) if the impairment meets the conditions for one of the \"listed\" impairments in the Social Security regulations, then the application is granted; 4) if the applicant's \"residual functional capacity\" is such that he or she can still perform past relevant work, then the application is denied; 5) if the applicant, given his or her residual functional capacity, education, work experience, and age, is unable to do any other work, the application is granted. Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the applicant has met his or her burden at Step 4 to show that he or she is unable to do past work due to the significant limitation, the Commissioner then has the burden at Step 5 of coming forward with evidence of specific jobs in the national economy that the applicant can still perform.

Sec'y of Health &amp; Human Servs., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"399275\"><a href=\"/opinion/399275/bienvenido-arocho-v-secretary-of-health-and-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">670</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">374</span></a></span>, 375 (1st Cir. 1982). If the applicant's limitations are exclusively exertional, then the Commissioner can meet her burden through the use of a chart contained in the Social Security regulations. 20 C.F.R. &#167; 416.969; Medical-Vocational Guidelines, 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, App. 2, tables 1-3 (2001), cited in 20 C.F.R. &#167; 416.969; Heckler v.

If the facts of the applicant's situation fit within the Grid's categories, the Grid \"directs a conclusion as to whether the individual is or is not disabled.\" 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, App. 2, &#167; 200.00(a), cited in 20 C.F.R &#167; 416.969. However, if the applicant has nonexertional limitations (such as mental, sensory, or skin impairments, or environmental restrictions such as an inability to tolerate dust, id. &#167; 200(e)) that restrict his ability to perform jobs he would otherwise be capable of performing, then the Grid is only a \"framework to guide [the] decision,\" 20 C.F.R. &#167; 416.969a(d) (2001).

His work history is that of an unskilled laborer; his education ended at seventh grade. At the ALJ hearing, Seavey presented medical evidence concerning his back pain and the degree of limitation it imposes on him. He also presented evidence in the form of an expert report from a psychologist, Dr. Greene. Dr. Greene's report stated that \"Seavey appears to be a 'textbook example' of an individual with passive-aggressive personality disorder\" who may also meet the diagnostic criteria for avoidant personality disorder, and that he tested at the borderline Verbal IQ range. Following the hearing, Seavey's attorney submitted a letter from Dr. Greene,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> along with psychological testing results, to clarify Dr. Greene's earlier findings, particularly her notation that Seavey had an elevated score on the \"Work Interference\" scale, indicating behavioral attributes that would negatively affect his ability to work. Dr. Greene's letter stated that Seavey may meet the diagnostic criteria for a Reading Disorder and that \"he would have great difficulty performing any jobs that require much reading.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> However, the letter also stated that Seavey's low IQ and reading ability, combined with his desire to get the testing over with quickly, meant that the Work Interference score might not be valid. Dr. Greene also noted that she had not observed any problems with Seavey's concentration, persistence, or pace during her interactions with him, and that she did not believe he would \"decompensate on the job.\" In addition, records from one of Seavey's treating physicians indicate that he did not appear to have any problems in understanding, concentration, or persistence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ found that Seavey is limited to \"light work\" by his back ailment. The ALJ's decision did not mention Dr. Greene's report and letter or any psychological evidence,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> but simply found that Seavey \"has no significant non-exertional limitations.\" The ALJ then used the Grid to find him to be not disabled. Seavey appealed to the Social Security Appeals Council, arguing that his mental and cognitive impairments were significant nonexertional limitations and therefore the Grid was not dispositive of his claim. Almost two years later, the Appeals Council denied his appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seavey then sought review in federal district court. The district judge assigned the case to a magistrate judge, who prepared a report and recommendation. As to the Supplemental Security Income claim, the magistrate judge found that the ALJ had erred by applying the Grid to Seavey after stating in the hearing that the psychological profile did not indicate anything of a \"disabling nature.\" Seavey v. Apfel, No. 00-23-B, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1499277</span></span>, at *2 (D. Me. Oct. 6, 2000). The correct question, the magistrate judge's report said, is not whether the nonexertional limitations are themselves disabling, but whether the nonexertional limitations significantly limit the applicant's ability to perform work at a given exertional level (in Seavey's case, \"light\" work). Id. If so, then the Grid is not dispositive. Id. The magistrate judge's report stated that the Commissioner bears the burden of proof at Step 5, and that when nonexertional limitations have more than a marginal effect, the Commissioner must present testimony from a vocational expert. Id. at *3. Finally, the magistrate judge's report recommended that the district judge order the Commissioner to pay Supplemental Security Income benefits to Seavey.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Id. Although the magistrate judge's review of the ALJ's decision was to determine whether substantial evidence supported the findings of the ALJ, Ward v. Commissioner of Social Security, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198906\"><a href=\"/opinion/198906/ward-v-social-security/\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">652</span></a></span>, 655 (1st Cir. 2000), the district court's review of the magistrate judge's decision is de novo as to objections raised. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 636(b)(1)(C) (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge agreed with the magistrate judge's report and, in a one paragraph order, vacated the ALJ decision and ordered the Commissioner to pay benefits to Seavey.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commissioner argues that, although the ALJ erred in not discussing the evidence of psychological impairment, the evidence, including Dr. Greene's report, did not necessarily establish the existence of a significant nonexertional limitation. Therefore, the Commissioner says, the ALJ's opinion could have been affirmed in its current state on the assumption that the ALJ had implicitly discredited Dr. Greene's letter and report. This argument is not persuasive because, although \"a nonexertional impairment can have a negligible effect,\" ordinarily the ALJ \"must back such a finding of negligible effect with the evidence to substantiate it,\" Talbot v. Heckler, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"485333\"><a href=\"/opinion/485333/17-socsecrepser-129-unemplinsrep-cch-17537-harley-t-talbot-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">814</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1456</span></a></span>, 1465 (10th Cir. 1987), unless the matter is self-evident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, the Commissioner argues that the proper remedy would be a remand for further administrative proceedings. She argues that a remand with an order to pay benefits is only appropriate where the evidence shows a \"virtually certain entitlement to benefits.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commissioner further maintains that this magistrate judge has a policy of remanding with an order to pay benefits, rather than remanding for further administrative proceedings, whenever it finds an error at Step 5 in the process.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Counsel for Seavey disputed that point at oral argument. The magistrate judge, in his Report and Recommendation for this case, relied upon his reasoning in a previous case, Field v. Chater, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1461513\"><a href=\"/opinion/1461513/field-v-chater/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

In Field, the magistrate judge wrote that \"[w]hen the Commissioner had a full and fair opportunity to develop the record and meet her burden at Step 5, there is no reason for the court to remand for further factfinding.\" Field, 920 F.

Field, 920 F. Supp. at 243. The opinion in Field emphasized that \"where the problem is . . . the more fundamental problem of insufficient evidence on an issue for which the Commissioner carries the burden,\" further proceedings are not warranted. Id. at 243. In this case, the magistrate judge looked no further than the Field case to conclude that \"the [C]ommissioner's failure to carry his burden at Step 5 requires remand for payment of benefits,\" Seavey, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1499277</span></span>, at *3, without analyzing the differences between the cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seavey responds that the Commissioner is simply being held to the same standard as any other litigant in any other case -- if he does not meet his burden, then an order to pay benefits is appropriate. He claims that \"[t]he Secretary who has the benefit of institutional expertise and a huge federal bureaucracy in effect argues that no matter how egregious the error they must be given one chance after another to remedy their mistake unless the record demonstrates with virtual certainty that the applicant will win on remand.\" In essence, Seavey argues that the Commissioner wants an impermissible second bite at the apple.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The premise of Seavey's position is that the Commissioner should be treated like any other litigant and that remanding and allowing new evidence would be giving the Commissioner an unfair advantage. The premise is not entirely correct. Because of the nonadversarial nature of Social Security disability determinations, the Commissioner is not a litigant and has no representative at the agency level. Indeed, the model is investigatory, or inquisitorial, rather than adversarial. Sims v. Apfel, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087669\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087669/sims-v-apfel/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span>, 110 (2000). It is the ALJ's duty to investigate and develop the facts and develop the arguments both for and against the granting of benefits. Id. At the ALJ level, the applicant is the only litigant presenting evidence. While the agency may have already generated evidence and the ALJ may generate more -- for example, by sending the applicant for a consultative exam or by calling a medical or vocational expert -- these experts function as consultants in the adjudicative process, assisting the ALJ in determining what the outcome should be. They are not experts retained in an effort to shore up an agency's litigation position. That is because, until the ALJ renders a decision on whether an applicant is disabled or not, the agency has not taken a final position. Consequently, when an ALJ improperly concludes that a nonexertional impairment has no significant impact on residual functional capacity, that is an adjudicator making a mistake, not a party litigator failing to present evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judicial review of Social Security administrative determinations is authorized by 42 U.S.C. &#167; 405(g) (1994). Both the fourth and sixth sentences of this subsection grant federal courts the power to remand cases to the Commissioner. The fourth sentence of this subsection states that a reviewing court \"shall have power to enter, upon the pleadings and transcript of the record, a judgment affirming, modifying, or reversing the decision of the Commissioner of Social Security, with or without remanding the cause for a rehearing.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 405(g). The sixth sentence states that the court \"may at any time order additional evidence to be taken before the Commissioner of Social Security, but only upon a showing that there is new evidence which is material and that there is good cause for the failure to incorporate such evidence into the record in a prior proceeding.\" Id. As discussed below, we view this case as governed by the fourth sentence of &#167; 405(g). See Sullivan v.

See Higgins v.

Seavey has urged us to adopt this approach, and the Commissioner has not contested this point before us.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, we find that the decision as to what remedy to apply under sentence four of &#167; 405(g) is largely dictated by the type of error made by the ALJ or Commissioner, as discussed below, and therefore is not, for the most part, a matter of discretion. Unlike in appeals where the district court has acted as the trial court, the district court here has no institutional advantage over this court. The district court reviews the same cold administrative record as do we, applying the same \"substantial evidence\" test. The First Circuit has never recognized any distinction between the scope of a district court's review of Social Security determinations and the scope of appellate review. See, e.g., Ward, 211 F.3d at 655; Nguyen v. Chater, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762678\"><a href=\"/opinion/762678/61-socsecrepser-8-unemplinsrep-cch-p-16166b-hung-nguyen-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 35 (1st Cir. 1999) (per curiam); Splude v.

Similarly, under the Administrative Procedure Act, courts of appeals directly review the administrative action and use the same standard of review as the district court. Baystate Alternative Staffing, Inc. v.

We are not convinced that we should now create an exception to this general rule for cases challenging the remand instructions when the Commissioner or ALJ has erred. Therefore, we review de novo the district court's decision to order payment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Remedy Upon Remand</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying our standard of review here, we hold that the district court committed error by remanding with instructions to pay. Such a result is inconsistent with our precedent and an unnecessary abrogation of the Commissioner's authority to adjudicate applications for disability benefits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question of remedy is tied to the strictures of &#167; 405(g): \"the findings of the Commissioner of Social Security as to any fact, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 405(g). Hence, the responsibility for weighing conflicting evidence, where reasonable minds could differ as to the outcome, falls on the Commissioner and his designee, the ALJ. Walker v. Bowen, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498189\"><a href=\"/opinion/498189/20-socsecrepser-20-unemplinsrep-cch-17683-benny-walker/\"><span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></a></span>, 639-40 (7th Cir. 1987). It does not fall on the reviewing court. The question of what instructions should accompany a remand order will turn on the nature of the error at the ALJ proceedings. Here, the Commissioner agrees that the ALJ was in error because the ALJ ignored relevant and material evidence. The reports were relevant to show that Seavey had nonexertional limitations that could significantly impair his ability to perform the full range of light or sedentary work and, hence, that reliance on the Grid was inappropriate. Rose, 34 F.3d at 19; Heggarty, 947 F.2d at 995-96; 20 C.F.R. &#167; 416.969a. The Commissioner says that ordinarily in cases with this sort of error, she would have voluntarily sought remand to the ALJ. The Commissioner did not do so here because, in the Commissioner's view, the court can review the record and decide that the only reasonable conclusion is that Seavey has not shown that any nonexertional limitation significantly affects his ability to perform light work, and therefore he is not disabled. But, the Commissioner says, if the court does not agree that this is the only reasonable conclusion, then we should send the matter back for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we are confronted with a case where the ALJ did not make any findings on a key issue -- whether Seavey has a significant nonexertional impairment. As a result, there was no evidence introduced on a second, subordinate issue; if the ALJ had found that Seavey had a significant, nonexertional limitation, he would have then progressed to a finding of whether the combined exertional and nonexertional impairments rendered Seavey unable to perform a significant number of light or sedentary jobs. Seavey does not advance the argument before this court that the record, as it currently stands, conclusively shows that he is disabled under the meaning of the statute. That would require vocational evidence to establish whether there are jobs he could perform, given his combined exertional and nonexertional limitations. Heggarty, 947 F.2d at 996. Instead, Seavey maintains that the Commissioner is to blame for the insufficiency of the record, as the Commissioner failed to call a vocational expert to testify at the hearing, and therefore she need not be given a second chance through further proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such an approach, however, is not consistent with the dictates of &#167; 405(g) or with the approach generally taken when reviewing administrative actions. Instead, the rule we adopt is that ordinarily the court can order the agency to provide the relief it denied only in the unusual case in which the underlying facts and law are such that the agency has no discretion to act in any manner other than to award or to deny benefits. Put differently, if the evidence and law compelled one conclusion or the other, then the court could order an award of benefits or affirm a denial of benefits. For example, a judicial award of benefits would be proper where the proof of disability is overwhelming or where the proof is very strong and there is no contrary evidence. See Mowery v. Heckler, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"457734\"><a href=\"/opinion/457734/11-socsecrepser-32-unemplinsrep-cch-16301-harvey-s-mowery-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">771</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">966</span></a></span>, 973 (6th Cir. 1985). Similarly, if correcting the legal error clarified the record sufficiently that an award or denial of benefits was the clear outcome, then the court may order payment or affirm denial. Conversely, if an essential factual issue has not been resolved, as here, and there is no clear entitlement to benefits, the court must remand for further proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> A number of circuits appear to have adopted this view. See Holohan v. Massanari, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772880\"><a href=\"/opinion/772880/anne-j-holohan-v-larry-g-massanari-acting-commissionerof-ssa/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1195</span></a></span>, 1210 (9th Cir. 2001) (\"[A] remand for further proceedings is unnecessary if the record is fully developed and it is clear from the record that the ALJ would be required to award benefits.\"); Faucher v.

When an agency has not considered all relevant factors in taking action, or has provided insufficient explanation for its action, the reviewing court ordinarily should remand the case to the agency. Fla. Power &amp; Light Co. v. Lorion, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111379\"><a href=\"/opinion/111379/florida-power-light-co-v-lorion/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">729</span></a></span>, 744 (1985) (\"If the record before the agency does not support the agency action . . . the proper course, except in rare circumstances, is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's and the magistrate judge's decisions rest, in part, on the erroneous conclusion that the Commissioner would not be able to supplement a record upon remand, absent a showing of \"good cause\" for failure to introduce the necessary vocational evidence at the ALJ hearing, and therefore a remand would not serve any purpose. See Field v. Chater, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1461513\"><a href=\"/opinion/1461513/field-v-chater/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">240</span></a></span>, 244 (D. Me. 1995). However, this reasoning depends on two incorrect assumptions. First, it assumes that additional evidence is definitively needed. Additional evidence would only be necessary in this case if the ALJ determines that Seavey's evidence indicates a significant nonexertional limitation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Without that preliminary finding, we cannot know whether the denial of benefits can withstand the lack of vocational evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the magistrate judge's and district court's reasoning assumes that good cause is a requirement for introducing new evidence in a sentence four remand. The \"good cause\" concept is derived from the sixth sentence of &#167; 405(g), quoted above. Field, 920 F. Supp. at 244. The magistrate judge's recommendation also relies on older Second Circuit precedent, which also employs the \"good cause\" reasoning in determining when orders to pay are appropriate. Id. at 242 (citing Carroll v. Sec'y of Health &amp; Human Servs., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"417706\"><a href=\"/opinion/417706/herbert-carroll-v-secretary-of-health-and-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">705</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">638</span></a></span>, 643-44 (2d Cir. 1983)). However, this reasoning erroneously combines two separate grants of remand power contained within &#167; 405(g) -- that granted by the fourth sentence and that granted by the sixth sentence. Since the Second Circuit decided Carroll, the Supreme Court has made clear that the sixth sentence of &#167; 405(g) and the fourth sentence of &#167; 405(g) are two distinct grants of remand power, which apply in two distinct situations. Shalala v. Schaefer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112895\"><a href=\"/opinion/112895/shalala-v-schaefer/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">292</span></a></span>, 297-301 (1993); Sullivan v.

Sentence six and its \"good cause\" limitation come into play only \"when the district court learns of evidence not in existence or available to the applicant at the time of the administrative proceeding that might have changed the outcome of that proceeding.\" Finkelstein, 496 U.S. at 626. Sentence six has been referred to as a \"pre-judgment remand,\" employed where the federal court has not ruled on the validity of the Commissioner's position, while sentence four has been referred to as a \"post-judgment remand.\" See Faucher v. Sec'y of Health &amp; Human Servs., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"663747\"><a href=\"/opinion/663747/43-socsecrepser-719-unemplinsrep-cch-p-17711a-janet-l-faucher/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">171</span></a></span>, 175 (6th Cir. 1994). This case is clearly governed by sentence four and therefore the \"good cause\" restriction of sentence six does not apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unlike sentence six, sentence four does not contain any statutory limits on the ability to supplement the record on remand. Nonetheless, we do not rule out the possibility of some constraints in unusual cases. In some Social Security cases, for example, the delay in final disposition of claims may, at times, make requests by the Commissioner for additional proceedings a matter of some concern. Many Social Security applicants are represented by non-lawyers or have no representation at all, and most are indigent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> Some circuits have exercised what we view as a form of equitable power to order benefits in cases where the entitlement is not totally clear, but the delay involved in repeated remands has become unconscionable. E.g., Morales v. Apfel, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770264\"><a href=\"/opinion/770264/william-morales-v-kenneth-s-apfel-commissioner-of-social-security-dc/\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">310</span></a></span>, 320 (3d Cir. 2000) (remanding for payment of benefits in light of \"substantial evidence\" of a severe mental disability and \"considerable inexplicable delays\" resulting in passage of ten years since application). In such cases, our sister circuits have warned the Commissioner that administrative deference does not entitle the Commissioner to endless opportunities to get it right.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> See, e.g., Miller v. Chater, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"728961\"><a href=\"/opinion/728961/52-socsecrepser-73-unemplinsrep-cch-p-15600b-patrick-k-miller-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">972</span></a></span>, 978 (10th Cir. 1996) (remanding for fifth administrative hearing, but cautioning \"the agency that the Secretary is not entitled to adjudicate a case ad infinitum until [she] correctly applies the proper legal standard and gathers evidence to support [her] conclusion.\") (internal quotations omitted). This, however, is not such a case, and we need not decide the extent of any such equitable limits here.

P, App. 2, &#167; 201.00(i).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p>  During the hearing, the ALJ, referring to Dr. Greene's initial report, noted that \"[t]here's no evidence that there's anything of a disabling nature in his psychological profile in this report.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p>  The magistrate judge recommended affirmance of the denial of Seavey's application for Social Security disability benefits because Seavey had not demonstrated he was disabled on or before December 31, 1995, the last date that he was covered by Social Security disability insurance. Seavey, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1499277</span></span>, at *2. There has been no appeal from that determination, so the SSD claim has been abandoned.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p>  The Commissioner also argues that, in this case, the ALJ error was actually in Step 4, not Step 5, as nonexertional limitations are a component of the applicant's \"residual functional capacity,\" which is determined at Step 4. We do not see how this technicality would affect the outcome of the case -- particularly since the denial of benefits occurred at Step 5 -- and therefore, we will not address this issue.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p>  We note that, in many of the cases holding that abuse of discretion is the proper standard of review, the deferential standard benefitted the Commissioner, as the district court had ordered further proceedings upon remand and the applicant was seeking an order for immediate payment. See Higgins, 222 F.3d at 505; Harman, 211 F.3d at 1174; Nelson, 210 F.3d at 801.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p>  Even if we were to apply the abuse of discretion standard, the result would be the same in this case. The district court's rule that an order for payment is appropriate whenever the Commissioner has failed to disprove disability at Step 5 is an erroneous interpretation of the law; abuse of discretion review encompasses errors of law. See United States v. Davis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774499\"><a href=\"/opinion/774499/united-states-v-william-m-davis-ashland-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">261</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir. 2001).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p>  Before addressing the remedial issue, we pause to note another issue argued by the parties. The magistrate judge assumed that at step 5 the Commissioner bears the burden of proof, which influenced the magistrate judge's recommendation for disposition. Seavey, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1499277</span></span>, at *3. There is, however, some dispute over who bears the burden of proof at the fifth step of the disability determination process. At the fifth step, the Commissioner bears some type of burden to come forward with evidence showing that there are jobs that the applicant can perform despite his limitations. However, the parties dispute whether this is a burden of proof or merely a burden of production. In a sense, this discussion relies on a series of misnomers, as the Commissioner is not actually represented as a litigant. It may be better to think of this not as a shifting of burdens, but rather as a rule providing that the applicant is not under any obligation to produce evidence at Step 5.</p>\n        <p>This is not a new debate, see Dobrowolsky v. Califano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"370284\"><a href=\"/opinion/370284/george-dobrowolsky-v-joseph-a-califano-jr-secretary-health/\"><span class=\"volume\">606</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">403</span></a></span>, 406 (3d Cir. 1979), but there continues to be no clear answer within appellate case law. In the First Circuit, our terminology has not been entirely consistent. Compare Heggarty v. Sullivan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"571056\"><a href=\"/opinion/571056/35-socsecrepser-400-unemplinsrep-cch-p-16302a-david-heggarty-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">947</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">990</span></a></span>, 997 (1st Cir. 1991) (per curiam) (referring to Agency's \"burden of proof\"), with Torres v. Sec'y of Health &amp; Human Servs., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"403544\"><a href=\"/opinion/403544/felix-torres-v-secretary-of-health-and-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">677</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></a></span>, 168 (1st Cir. 1982) (\"burden . . . of showing\"), Arocho, 670 F.2d at 375 (\"burden of coming forward with evidence\"), and Geoffroy v. Sec'y of Health &amp; Human Servs., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"396508\"><a href=\"/opinion/396508/william-p-geoffroy-v-secretary-of-health-and-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">663</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span></a></span>, 317 (1st Cir. 1981) (\"responsibility to establish\").</p>\n        <p>In most cases involving review of Social Security administrative determinations, the distinction between a burden of proof and a burden of production will be meaningless, as our inquiry into the evidence (like that of the district court) is limited to a determination of whether the Commissioner's decision was supported by substantial evidence. Miranda v. Sec'y of Health, Educ. &amp; Welfare, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"327027\"><a href=\"/opinion/327027/manuel-a-miranda-v-secretary-of-health-education-and-welfare/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">996</span></a></span>, 998 (1st Cir. 1975). It is possible in some case that the Commissioner's burden may have some relevance in determining whether further proceedings are appropriate. Nonetheless, in this case, it is not determinative. The only evidence introduced by the Commissioner at Step 5 was the Grid, which was insufficient as a matter of law to deny benefits, given that Seavey had introduced evidence to support his claim that nonexertional limitations significantly limited his ability to work. Rose, 34 F.3d at 19; Heggarty, 947 F.2d at 995-96; 20 C.F.R. &#167; 416.969a.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p>  This was not Seavey's original position before the district court. Originally, he sought only a remand for further proceedings, but the magistrate judge suggested he request an order to pay instead.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p>  If the district court remands to the agency for further proceedings where the applicant has sought payment of benefits and has requested a remand for further proceedings only as an alternative remedy, the applicant may appeal that remand order to this court. Forney v. Apfel, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118231\"><a href=\"/opinion/118231/forney-v-apfel/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">266</span></a></span>, 271 (1998).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p>  At this stage, we make no determination as to whether an ALJ finding that the evidence was sufficient to show a significant nonexertional limitation, or a finding that the evidence was not sufficient to show a significant nonexertional limitation, would meet the \"substantial evidence\" test.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p>  Moreover, as representatives are commonly paid for their advocacy during the agency adjudication with a percentage of the lump sum retroactive benefit payment that applicants receive when their applications are approved, see 42 U.S.C. &#167; 406(a)(2)(A) (1994), there is little financial incentive for the agency or the representative to expedite agency proceedings. We do note that the Equal Access to Justice Act, under which the Commissioner may be compelled to pay the attorney's fees and expenses of successful applicants, Schaefer, 509 U.S. at 302-03, provides an incentive to the agency not to take unreasonable positions on appeal.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p>  At the same time, the Supreme Court has noted that Congress was fully aware of the serious delays in resolution of disability claims, yet declined to impose deadlines; as a result, the Court vacated an injunction imposing a flat deadline.
