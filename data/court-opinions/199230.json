D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Torruella, Chief Judge,\n                 Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\n\f     David Mockler on brief pro se.\n     James T.

Following a one-day bench trial, the\n\ndistrict court upheld the validity of a grant of easement\n\nwhich afforded the appellee pipeline company a right-of-way\n\nacross    appellant    Mockler's    property        to       construct    and\n\nmaintain a natural gas pipeline.               Mockler now appeals,\n\nraising   two   assignments    of   error.         As   we    find   neither\n\npersuasive, we summarily affirm.\n\n           Mockler first argues that his charge of fraud was\n\nimpermissibly rejected.       The district court found, contrary\n\nto   Mockler's        assertions,      that        appellee       had     not\n\nmisrepresented the pipeline's location to him in the course\n\nof negotiating the easement and, further, that a revised\n\nroute had been properly approved by the government prior to\n\nthat time.      \"In reviewing factual findings, this court\n\napplies   the   clear-error    standard       of   review,\"      Vinick    v.\n\nUnited States, 205 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2000), under which we\n\naccept the lower court's findings unless we are \"left with\n\nthe definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been\n\ncommitted,\" Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564,\n\n573 (1985) (quoting United States v. United States Gypsum\n\nCo., 333 U.S. 364, 395 (1948)).           Our review of the record\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f reveals no such mistake.            Mockler's own witnesses (two\n\n neighboring      landowners)      belied     any        suggestion       that\n\n appellee's \"land agent\" was purveying false information.\n\n And appellee's evidence concerning the approval of \"Reroute\n\n 63-D\" went entirely unrebutted.           There was no clear error.1\n\n              Mockler   also    contends    that    he    was    denied     his\n\n Seventh Amendment right to a trial by jury.                  Yet he has not\n\n even attempted to explain how this case--a diversity action\n\n seeking a declaratory judgment as to the validity of an\n\n easement--might involve \"rights and remedies of the sort\n\n traditionally enforced in an action at law, rather than in\n\n an action in equity.\"         Pernell v. Southall Realty, 416 U.S.\n\n 363, 375 (1974).       The argument not only is without merit but\n\n also   has    been   waived--whether      because       of    the   lack    of\n\n \"developed     argumentation\"      on    appeal,    United      States      v.\n\n Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990), or because of the\n\n lack   of    objection   below,    see,    e.g.,    8    Moore's    Federal\n\n Practice §§ 38.52[4], 39.13[1][c] (3d ed. 2000).\n\n              Affirmed.    See Loc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n    1  Even if a misrepresentation had occurred, we fail to see\nhow Mockler could establish justifiable reliance thereon, in\nlight of his admitted failure to read the contract or to review\nthe  accompanying   diagram  which   accurately  depicted   the\npipeline's route across his property.    See, e.g., Francis v.\nStinson, 760 A.2d 209, 217-18 (Me. 2000).\n\n                                    -4-\n\f",
