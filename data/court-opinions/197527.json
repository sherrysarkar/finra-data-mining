He\r\n\nalleged that he was discriminated against on the basis of his\r\n\nrace, national origin, and  age, in his work  assignments, in\r\n\ndenials of promotions and awards, and in being subjected to a\r\n\nhostile work environment.  The district court granted summary\r\n\njudgment to the defendant.  We affirm.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n                           A. Facts\r                                               \r\n\n          Viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\r\n\nparty (DeNovellis) and  drawing all reasonable inferences  in\r\n\nhis favor,  the following facts are treated as undisputed for\r\n\npurposes of the motion for summary judgment.  DeNovellis is a\r\n\nwhite male of Italian descent.  He was sixty-six years old at\r\n\nthe time he filed this action in 1994.  \r\n\n          From  1979  to  1991 DeNovellis  served  as  Deputy\r\n\nRegional Administrator (DRA) of the Boston Regional Office of\r\n\nHuman  Development Services  (HDS), which  was  part of  HHS.\r\n\nDeNovellis's   position   was   eliminated   in   an   agency\r\n\nreorganization  that occurred in  the spring of  1991.  After\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nsome  months \"in limbo,\" in the form of temporary assignments\r\n\nto  \"meaningless\" positions,  DeNovellis  became the  program\r\n\nmanager of the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC)\r\n\nprogram  within   the  recently  formed   Administration  for\r\n\nChildren  and  Families  (ACF).    His  civil  service  grade\r\n\nremained the same:  GS-14.  \r\n\n          Until the reorganization,  DeNovellis's supervisor,\r\n\nA.  Kenton Williams, was  the Regional Administrator  (RA) of\r\n\nHDS.  Williams was a black male of the age of fifty-five when\r\n\nthis action  was filed.   There were  racial tensions  in the\r\n\noffice.   Williams  often spoke  out  against the  \"insidious\r\n\nracism  that  exists  in  our  society,\"  and,  according  to\r\n\nDeNovellis,  \"would try to justify the behavior and reactions\r\n\nof  black staff persons, who having  been subjected to racial\r\n\ndiscrimination  over  the  years,  reacted differently  under\r\n\ncertain circumstances.\"  Williams also wrote a  letter to the\r\n\neditor  of the  Boston Globe  commenting  on the  \"tremendous\r                                        \r\n\npressures\" faced by  black executives.  These  comments about\r\n\nthe  inequities  suffered  by  blacks  made  DeNovellis  feel\r\n\nuncomfortable. \r\n\n          There were  also ethnic  and race-related  comments\r\n\naround the  office that  Williams condoned.   Members  of the\r\n\nstaff would say things like  \"Vinnie, why don't you have your\r\n\npeople (Mafia) in  the North  End take care  of them.\"   (The\r\n\nNorth End is a largely Italian neighborhood of Boston.)  Both\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nWilliams and a black friend  of his, St. Clair Phillips, made\r\n\nnegative comments about  DeNovellis's ethnicity.   And  staff\r\n\nmembers made general references to \"you whites\" in Williams's\r\n\npresence.\r\n\n          Williams  and  DeNovellis   also  had  work-related\r\n\nconflicts.   Part  of DeNovellis's  job  as DRA  was to  take\r\n\ncharge  of the regional  activities during the  RA's absence.\r\n\nWilliams   was  often  absent  from  the  office  and  became\r\n\nconcerned that DeNovellis was signing  so much correspondence\r\n\non Williams's behalf that it would highlight the frequency of\r\n\nhis absences.   For this reason, Williams  ordered DeNovellis\r\n\nin 1989 to stop signing letters on his behalf.\r\n\n          In 1989 and  1990, other government administrators,\r\n\nincluding   Williams's  supervisor   in  Washington,   Pamela\r\n\nCoughlin,  who was white,  told Williams that  DeNovellis was\r\n\nspreading negative comments about Williams.  On more than one\r\n\noccasion, Williams also  had to intervene in  heated disputes\r\n\nthat DeNovellis  had with  other people in  the office.   One\r\n\nsuch incident  pertained to  the distribution  of space,  and\r\n\nanother concerned  whether a  minority student  (who did  not\r\n\nreport to DeNovellis) had been absent from work.\r\n\n          In 1990,  certain federal employees were  given the\r\n\nopportunity  to  choose  early  retirement.   DeNovellis  was\r\n\neligible  to retire but rejected  the offer.  Several people,\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nincluding  Williams and  two  of  his  black  friends,  urged\r\n\nDeNovellis to take this opportunity and retire.\r\n\n          The   heart   of  DeNovellis's   complaint   is  an\r\n\nassignment  to  a  temporary  \"detail\"  to  an \"unestablished\r\n\nposition\" in the Office of Fiscal Operations (OFO) in October\r\n\n1990.   Williams  claims  he was  instructed  to  order  this\r\n\nreassignment   by    Coughlin,   his    (white)   supervisor.\r\n\nNevertheless,  Williams now  admits that  the  detail was  \"a\r\n\nsham,\" and was  concocted in  part because  Williams did  not\r\n\nwant  DeNovellis to  be  his  deputy.   On  October 9,  1990,\r\n\nWilliams removed DeNovellis  from the order of  succession to\r\n\nact as RA.\r\n\n          DeNovellis suffered no diminution in grade, pay, or\r\n\nbenefits during the detail.  He worked under  the supervision\r\n\nof  Williams's friend,  St. Clair  Phillips,  who was  black.\r\n\nOfficially,   DeNovellis   was  responsible   for   financial\r\n\nactivities, for which he had  no training or capability.  For\r\n\nthe  first month  and a  half, he  \"performed the  same (DRA)\r\n\nduties under  a new  supervisor.\"  In  mid-November, the  new\r\n\nsupervisor,  Phillips,  asked  Williams  to  end  the  detail\r\n\nbecause DeNovellis did not have the background to perform the\r\n\nOFO work and he  was refusing to perform his old  DRA duties.\r\n\nWilliams refused.   The detail was due to  expire in February\r\n\n1991 but, upon Williams's request, was extended through March\r\n\n31, 1991.  \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n          On  March   8,  1991,   DeNovellis  filed   an  EEO\r\n\ncomplaint,  alleging   age,   race,   and   national   origin\r\n\ndiscrimination   in   assignment  of   duties,   awards,  and\r\n\nreassignment.  On April 11,  three days after the EEO officer\r\n\ninterviewed Williams,  Williams filed  forms requesting  that\r\n\nDeNovellis's position be switched with that of Paul Kelley, a\r\n\nblack  male who  was a  friend of  Williams's  and who  was a\r\n\nsupervisory  accountant in  OFO.    According to  DeNovellis,\r\n\nWilliams's purpose in making this request  was to protect the\r\n\ngrades of Phillips and Kelley, both black and both friends of\r\n\nhis, in  an impending  classification review.   However,  the\r\n\nclassification  review and the proposed \"job swap\" were never\r\n\ncarried out, overtaken  by the agency's restructuring  in the\r\n\nspring of 1991.\r\n\n          Around  the  same  time  that DeNovellis's  initial\r\n\ndetail expired  at the  end of March  1991, HHS  underwent an\r\n\ninternal  restructuring.   The former  HDS  and another  sub-\r\n\nagency of HHS, the Family Support Administration, were merged\r\n\ninto  a new  entity,  the  Administration  for  Children  and\r\n\nFamilies (ACF).   The  restructuring took  several months  to\r\n\neffectuate.  During the transition, DeNovellis maintained his\r\n\ntitle of DRA of HDS and carried out some tasks of  the Deputy\r\n\nposition, but he received no official assignments; as before,\r\n\npeople came to him for information.  \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n          In  April or May 1991, Hugh Galligan, a white male,\r\n\nwas appointed Acting  Regional Administrator of the  new ACF;\r\n\nhe appointed Williams as his Deputy.  By May, Williams was no\r\n\nlonger in charge  of the Boston office.   The appointments of\r\n\nGalligan and Williams were finalized on August 23, 1991.  Two\r\n\ndays  later,  DeNovellis's  position   was  \"realigned\";  his\r\n\nofficial title  remained  DRA of  HDS  (even though  HDS  was\r\n\nphasing out) but this was now within the new ACF.  The result\r\n\nwas that Williams was DRA of ACF, and DeNovellis retained the\r\n\njob  title \"DRA\" but  remained unassigned in  the new agency.\r\n\nHis grade remained unchanged throughout this period.\r\n\n          In   December  1991  Williams  left  Boston  for  a\r\n\nposition  in Washington,  D.C.    Galligan  then  transferred\r\n\nPhillips, who had  been the head of OFO of the new agency, to\r\n\nthe DRA position at  the new agency.  Because  Phillips was a\r\n\nGS-15 and  the new  DRA opening was  a GS-15,  Galligan could\r\n\ntransfer  Phillips  laterally  into  the  position without  a\r\n\ncompetitive search.  Since  DeNovellis was a GS-14,  he could\r\n\nnot have been promoted to Williams's former position unless a\r\n\njob  vacancy announcement  had been  made  and a  competitive\r\n\nsearch  performed.   There is no  evidence that  Galligan was\r\n\nprecluded  from instituting  such  a  search and  considering\r\n\nDeNovellis for the position.\r\n\n          In May 1992  DeNovellis was reassigned from  DRA of\r\n\nthe Office of Family Security  (OFS) in the new agency, to  a\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nsupervisory  position as  program manager  in  the same  OFS.\r\n\nThis  was not part of the management  team of the new agency.\r\n\nDeNovellis  was  the  last person  appointed  to  a permanent\r\n\nposition in the new agency.   Galligan has since detailed him\r\n\ntwice  to the  OFO as  an assistant  goal leader  for ongoing\r\n\nrestructuring.   (Thus, in  some respects, DeNovellis  claims\r\n\nhis job assignments have been inappropriate because they were\r\n\nbeneath  his DRA status  and in other  respects inappropriate\r\n\nbecause  the  positions  required   accounting  or  financial\r\n\nqualifications which he did not possess.)\r\n\n          According  to  DeNovellis,  at  least  part  of the\r\n\nreason for  the delay in  his reassignment in the  new agency\r\n\nwas a \"position  paper\" he  wrote in early  1992.  The  paper\r\n\npointed out the \"convoluted interactions that were going on,\"\r\n\nand  it accidently  was  mailed to  a  lot of  people  in the\r\n\nregion, creating a furor.  Galligan was asked to find out who\r\n\nwas   responsible  for  this  position  paper.    During  the\r\n\ninvestigation, DeNovellis's computer was confiscated.\r\n\n                             B.  \r\n\n                  District Court Proceedings\r                                                        \r\n\n          The district court granted  summary judgment to the\r\n\nSecretary as to all claims.  It dealt separately with each of\r\n\nthe four types of adverse  action alleged by DeNovellis.  The\r\n\ncourt relied  on Landgraf  v. USI Film  Prods., 511  U.S. 244\r                                                          \r\n\n(1994), to  reject  the Title  VII claim  for deprivation  of\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nduties   that  occurred  prior  to  November  21,  1991,  the\r\n\neffective  date of the Civil Rights Act  of 1991, 42 U.S.C.  \r\n\n1981a (\"the  Act\" or \"the  1991 Act\").  The  court concluded,\r\n\nessentially,  that  even   if  DeNovellis  was  discriminated\r\n\nagainst,  he was  not entitled  to any  remedy for  it.   The\r\n\nequitable remedies  available under  Title VII  prior to  the\r\n\n1991 Act were not appropriate  because he suffered no loss in\r\n\npay  or  loss   of  job  that  would  warrant   back  pay  or\r\n\nreinstatement (he did not  seek reinstatement).  And  the new\r\n\nremedies  made available under  the 1991 Act  (in particular,\r\n\ncompensatory  damages) are only available for acts which took\r\n\nplace after November 21, 1991, and therefore did not apply to\r\n\nDeNovellis's claims of pre-Act discrimination.1\r\n\n          The district  court rejected DeNovellis's  claim of\r\n\npost-Act  deprivation of  duties  based  on  his  failure  to\r\n\npresent sufficient evidence  to enable a reasonable  trier of\r\n\nfact   to  conclude  that  the  employer's  motive  for  such\r\n\ndeprivation was discriminatory.   Whereas DeNovellis provided\r\n\nindirect  evidence that Williams might have been motivated by\r\n\nimproper reasons  in making pre-Act assignments, Williams was\r\n\nno longer in charge of the  Boston office after May 1991  and\r\n\nhe left Boston  altogether in December 1991.   The court held\r\n\nthat  DeNovellis could not bootstrap the pre-May 1991 alleged\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The  court also  concluded that  such  remedies were  not\r\navailable under the  ADEA as a matter of  law, and DeNovellis\r\nhas not appealed that ruling.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\ndiscrimination  by Williams  into sufficient  evidence for  a\r\n\nreasonable  trier of fact to conclude that post-November 1991\r\n\ndecisions were animated by similar illegal bias. \r\n\n          DeNovellis  also  made  a  claim  of  hostile  work\r\n\nenvironment based  on  negative  comments  about  his  ethnic\r\n\nbackground  coupled with  his \"sham  detail.\"   The  district\r\n\ncourt rejected this claim for essentially the same reasons it\r\n\nrejected  the  deprivation  of duties  claims:    any pre-Act\r\n\nviolation was a wrong without a remedy based on Landgraf, and\r                                                                    \r\n\nthere   was   insufficient   evidence   that   any   post-Act\r\n\ndiscrimination  had  occurred.    The  court  stated  in  one\r\n\nsentence an alternative  ground for its  ruling:  failure  to\r\n\nexhaust administrative remedies.2\r\n\n          The district court also granted summary judgment to\r\n\nthe Secretary  on DeNovellis's  claim that  his computer  was\r\n\nconfiscated in retaliation for filing an EEO  complaint.  The\r\n\ncourt rejected this claim under  Title VII on the ground that\r\n\nDeNovellis  failed  to exhaust  his  administrative remedies,\r\n\nbecause  his EEO complaint alleged nothing about retaliation.\r\n\nThe court  rejected the retaliation  claim under ADEA  on the\r\n\nmerits (the  government had  waived exhaustion  as to  ADEA).\r\n\nThe court  concluded that  DeNovellis failed  to present  any\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.

The  court  also found  that  there  was sufficient\r\n\nevidence  in the  record to  create a  factual dispute  as to\r\n\nwhether the sham  detail and the  deprivation of duties  were\r\n\nmotivated  by illegal discrimination on Williams's part or by\r\n\nrace-neutral  (and therefore  not  violative  of  Title  VII)\r\n\npersonality  conflict  or  cronyism.   The  court  held that,\r\n\nalthough   DeNovellis  would  have  a  triable  issue  as  to\r\n\nliability for  pre-Act discrimination, he  had no right  to a\r\n\nremedy under the law as it existed prior to the 1991 Act.\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\n          Prior to enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1991,\r\n\nplaintiffs  in  Title  VII cases  were  limited  to equitable\r\n\nremedies (including back  pay, reinstatement, and  injunctive\r\n\nrelief).

The  Act,  which became  effective on  November 21,\r\n\n1991, amended Title VII, and \"effect[ed] a major expansion in\r\n\nthe    relief   available    to    victims   of    employment\r\n\ndiscrimination.\"  Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 254-55.  The 1991 Act\r                                      \r\n\ncreated  a  right   on  the  part  of   individuals  alleging\r\n\nintentional unlawful  discrimination to  recover compensatory\r\n\ndamages  \"for   future  pecuniary  losses,   emotional  pain,\r\n\nsuffering, inconvenience, mental  anguish, loss of  enjoyment\r\n\nof life, and other nonpecuniary  losses,\" as well as punitive\r\n\ndamages.   42  U.S.C.     1981a(a)(1) &amp;  (b)(3)  (1994);  see\r                                                                         \r\n\nMorrison v.

The Act  also gave Title VII plaintiffs the\r\n\nright to a  jury trial in cases where  they seek compensatory\r\n\nor  punitive damages.    42  U.S.C.    1981a(c).   These  new\r\n\nprovisions,  however, do not  apply to conduct  that occurred\r\n\nbefore  the effective  date of  the Act,  November 21,  1991.\r\n\nLandgraf, 511 U.S. at 247, 286.\r                    \r\n\n          Applying Landgraf to the instant case, the district\r                                       \r\n\ncourt  concluded that, even  if DeNovellis were  to establish\r\n\nafter trial that  his sham detail and  employment \"purgatory\"\r\n\nviolated his rights under Title VII, he would not be entitled\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nto any  remedy.   This is because  the sham  detail ended  in\r\n\nMarch  1991, prior  to the  effective date  of the  1991 Act.\r\n\nTherefore,  even if  liability were found  after trial  as to\r\n\nthat detail, the only remedies that would have been available\r\n\nto DeNovellis  were equitable,  such  as reinstatement,  back\r\n\npay, or  an injunction.   As the district court  analyzed the\r\n\nremedies for  pre-Act conduct:  because  DeNovellis \"suffered\r\n\nno loss of pay, he may  not recover back pay; because he  did\r\n\nnot quit  his job, he does not  seek reinstatement.  There is\r\n\nno possibility  of  enjoining Williams  from  future  details\r\n\nbecause he  is no longer  in the office, and  DeNovellis does\r\n\nnot  seek  an injunction  against  details by  Galligan.   In\r\n\nshort, the five-month detail ending in the spring of 1991, if\r\n\nbased  upon illegal  discrimination, was  a  wrong without  a\r\n\nremedy.\"    As to  the  post-Act deprivation  of  duties, the\r\n\ndistrict  court  found  insufficient  evidence  to  create  a\r\n\ntriable issue as  to discriminatory intent.   DeNovellis does\r\n\nnot directly appeal the latter determination.\r\n\n          Instead, DeNovellis takes  issue with both rulings,\r\n\npre-Act  and  post-Act,  by essentially  conflating  the two.\r\n\nDeNovellis argues  that he  was  the victim  of a  continuing\r\n\nviolation  that began before November 21, 1991, and continued\r\n\nthereafter, entitling him  to compensatory damages under  the\r\n\n1991  Act.  A related  continuing violation argument has been\r\n\napplied   to  other   time   requirements  imposed   by   the\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nantidiscrimination laws,4 but the  theory on which DeNovellis\r\n\nbases his argument is not one that the courts have approved.\r\n\n          We  have   delineated  two   types  of   continuing\r\n\nviolation cases:   systemic and serial.

Rather,  he  argues  (A)  that  a  serial\r\n\nviolation  occurred; (B) that  the continuing effects  of his\r\n\npre-Act  deprivation  of  duties   constituted  a  continuing\r\n\nviolation;  and (C)  that he  was  subjected to  a continuing\r\n\nhostile  work environment.

The district court found that DeNovellis failed\r\n\nto  offer sufficient evidence,  direct or  circumstantial, to\r\n\nmeet his  burden, even at  the summary judgment stage  of the\r\n\nlitigation,   of   providing    substantive   evidence   that\r\n\ndiscrimination  was a factor  in his post-Act  deprivation of\r\n\nduties.  \r\n\n          DeNovellis does not seriously  contest that finding\r\n\non appeal.   Nor could he:  the  record in this case presents\r\n\nqualitatively different  scenarios  for the  pre-Act and  the\r\n\npost-Act  periods.  The  district court correctly  found that\r\n\nthere was enough  evidence of possible  discriminatory animus\r\n\nbetween Williams  and DeNovellis that  a jury could  find the\r\n\npre-Act detail was  motivated by discrimination and  not mere\r\n\npersonality  differences or cronyism.   But once  that detail\r\n\nended and  Williams was no  longer in charge of  the Regional\r\n\nOffice, the reasons for DeNovellis's assignments were neither\r\n\nanalogous nor part of the  same pattern or series.  There  is\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\nprecious little  evidence or inference  to get to a  trier of\r\n\nfact  on   discriminatory  motive  for   post-Act  employment\r\n\ndecisions.  Of course, discrimination is not precluded merely\r\n\nbecause  Williams was no longer in charge.  Nor does the fact\r\n\nthat  Galligan is white insulate the  defendant from a charge\r\n\nthat  Galligan's actions were motivated  by race.  After all,\r\n\nfor  the  first  eight  months of  Galligan's  tenure  as RA,\r\n\nWilliams was  Galligan's deputy.  Galligan, as the new person\r\n\nin the  office, might  very well have  given great  weight to\r\n\nWilliams's    allegedly    biased    recommendations    about\r\n\nreassignment    of   subordinate    personnel   during    the\r\n\nreorganization, transition, and realignments.  But DeNovellis\r\n\npresented no  evidence of  such discriminatory taint,  either\r\n\ndirectly or by inference.  \r\n\n          Indeed,  there   is  evidence   to  the   contrary.\r\n\nBureaucratic  delays arising  from the  reorganization, which\r\n\nindisputably  had nothing  to  do  with  DeNovellis  or  with\r\n\ninvidious  characteristics,  overtook  DeNovellis's  personal\r\n\nsituation.   Further, at  his  deposition, DeNovellis  denied\r\n\nthat  any of Galligan's  actions were motivated  by invidious\r\n\ndiscrimination   in  any   decision  affecting   DeNovellis's\r\n\nemployment.  And DeNovellis  himself attributed a significant\r\n\npart of the delay in assigning him to a permanent position in\r\n\nthe  new agency to his own error  in judgment:  the \"position\r\n\npaper\" that he wrote and  widely disseminated.  The  district\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\ncourt  correctly concluded  that  the  record  in  this  case\r\n\ncontains  virtually  no  evidence  of  post-Act   violations.\r\n\nTherefore,  DeNovellis  cannot  rely  on  a serial  violation\r\n\ntheory to defeat the Secretary's motion for summary judgment.\r\n\n                    B.  Continuing Effects\r                                                      \r\n\n          DeNovellis also argues another theory to circumvent\r\n\nLandgraf:   that the  pre-Act sham  assignment constituted  a\r                    \r\n\ncontinuing   violation   through  its   continuing   effects.\r\n\nAlthough the assignment itself was a discrete action that was\r\n\nover  and  done  with before  November  21,  1991, DeNovellis\r\n\nemphasizes  that  its  effects  continued  into  the post-Act\r                                          \r\n\nperiod.  According to DeNovellis, these post-Act effects turn\r\n\nthe pre-Act discrimination into  a continuing violation  that\r\n\ncontinued  post-Act,   thereby  triggering  the   1991  Act's\r\n\nremedies.   But continuing effects, without  additional post-\r\n\nAct  discriminatory actions, do  not turn a  discrete pre-Act\r\n\ndecision into  a continuing violation.  See United Air Lines,\r                                                                         \r\n\nInc. v.

But the  Court has made it clear that  the focus\r\n\nof the  inquiry in continuing  violation cases  should be  on\r\n\n\"whether any present violation exists,\" not whether there are\r\n\nresidual  effects of past discriminatory conduct to which the\r\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\nstatute does not  apply.

Mills and other sexual harassment cases involve a\r                             \r\n\npervasive  and  continuing  hostile  work environment,  which\r\n\nconstitutes  a  continuing  violation,  akin  to  a  systemic\r\n\n                             -27-\r                                          27\r\r\n\n(continuing practice)  violation.  In  contrast, DeNovellis's\r\n\nallegations  of  \"purgatory\" job  assignments  set  forth, at\r\n\nbest,  allegations as to  discrete and independent employment\r\n\ndecisions,  however adverse.   Such claims are  not pervasive\r\n\nenough  to  be  considered as  one  continuous  imposition of\r\n\nhostile  work  environment, analogous  to  sexual harassment.\r\n\nNor  is  a  \"purgatory\"  assignment  sufficiently  severe  to\r\n\nconstitute,  by itself,  a  hostile  work  environment.    As\r\n\npreviously noted, the fact that  DeNovellis remained assigned\r\n\nto  \"purgatory\" cannot constitute  a post-Act violation, even\r\n\nthough the effects of that assignment decision were prolonged\r\n\ninto the post-Act period by the bureaucratic delays emanating\r\n\nfrom the  agency's reorganization.   See  Evans, 431  U.S. at\r                                                           \r\n\n558; see Part III.A., supra.\r                                       \r\n\n          DeNovellis correctly points out that the court must\r\n\nfocus on the work atmosphere as a whole, and not separate out\r\n\neach  demeaning  work  assignment  or  derogatory remark  for\r\n\nindividual   analysis.    See   Vance,  863  F.2d   at  1510.\r                                                 \r\n\nNevertheless,  the  question is  whether  he produced  enough\r\n\nevidence on  the entire summary  judgment record to  enable a\r\n\nreasonable  trier  of  fact  to  find  a  cognizable  hostile\r\n\nenvironment claim.  We agree  with the district court that he\r\n\ndid not. \r\n\n          Williams and  others  at HHS  apparently made  some\r\n\nscattered  comments  that  could  be  construed  as  evincing\r\n\n                             -28-\r                                          28\r\r\n\nracial,  ethnic, or age-based hostility, although some of the\r\n\ncomments   in  the  record  were  not  made  in  DeNovellis's\r\n\npresence.  DeNovellis does not argue that these comments were\r\n\nsevere  or pervasive, nor does he claim that they rise to the\r\n\nlevel of sufficiency necessary to make out a prima facie case\r\n\nof harassment.  Rather, he appears to offer them as probative\r\n\nof discriminatory motive underlying his job assignments.\r\n\n          The  major  aspect  of his  work  environment  that\r\n\nDeNovellis  claims was  hostile or  \"harassing\"  was his  so-\r\n\ncalled \"employment purgatory\" of job assignments to positions\r\n\nhe considered to be unfit for his level of qualification.  As\r\n\nalready  noted, the  \"hostile\"  aspect  of  remaining  in  an\r\n\nundesirable  job  assignment  is  not  akin  to  a  pervasive\r\n\nenvironment  claim; it  is  a  discrete employment  decision,\r\n\nhowever adverse it may  be.  Even when this  is combined with\r\n\nthe derogatory comments, we do not think a fact-finder, based\r\n\non  this record, could  reasonably conclude that DeNovellis's\r\n\nwork environment was so pervaded with  racial, ethnic, or age\r\n\ndiscrimination  so as to constitute a violation of Title VII.\r\n\n          That DeNovellis would  be left without a  remedy if\r\n\nwe affirm  the district court's decision is  not a sufficient\r\n\nreason to  warrant reversal.   The Court in Landgraf  was not\r                                                                \r\n\nmoved  by petitioner's argument  there that, \"if  she [could]\r\n\nnot obtain damages pursuant to [the 1991 Act], she [would] be\r\n\nleft  remediless despite an  adjudged violation of  her right\r\n\n                             -29-\r                                          29\r\r\n\nunder Title VII to be free of workplace discrimination.\"  511\r\n\nU.S. at 285  n.38.  As the  Court put it, Title  VII \"did not\r\n\ncreate   a   'general   right   to   sue'    for   employment\r\n\ndiscrimination, but instead specified a set of 'circumscribed\r\n\nremedies,'\"  and \"[u]ntil the  1991 amendment, the  Title VII\r\n\nscheme did not allow for damages.  We are not free to fashion\r\n\nremedies  that  Congress  has   specifically  chosen  not  to\r\n\nextend.\"  Id. (quoting United  States v. Burke, 504 U.S. 229,\r                                                          \r\n\n240 (1992)).   DeNovellis's lack  of a remedy (even  if there\r\n\nwere a violation) is a result of the way Congress had drafted\r\n\nTitle VII  prior to the  1991 Act; whatever  unfairness arose\r\n\nfrom that  limited remedial  scheme  affected all  plaintiffs\r\n\nsuing under it.  \r\n\n                             IV.\r\n\n            Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies\r                                                             \r\n\n          DeNovellis argues that the district  court erred in\r\n\ndismissing his post-detail deprivation of duties  and hostile\r\n\nenvironment  claims   because  he  failed   to  exhaust   his\r\n\nadministrative   remedies.     DeNovellis  misconstrues   the\r\n\ndistrict court's decision.   The court did  not grant summary\r\n\njudgment   against  him  based  on  his  failure  to  exhaust\r\n\nadministrative  remedies.    With  respect  to  the  post-Act\r\n\ndeprivation  of  duties  the district  court  stated  that \"a\r\n\nstrong argument\" could be made  that he has not exhausted his\r\n\nTitle  VII claim,  but the  court did  not decide  the issue.\r\n\n                             -30-\r                                          30\r\r\n\nMoreover, with respect to his claim under the ADEA, the court\r\n\nnoted  that  the   government  had   waived  any   exhaustion\r\n\nargument.7     The  district   court  decided   the  post-Act\r\n\ndeprivation  of duties  claim on  the  basis that  DeNovellis\r\n\nfailed   to  produce   evidence  to   support   a  claim   of\r\n\ndiscrimination, sufficient to withstand summary judgment.\r\n\n          The  district court  rejected DeNovellis's  hostile\r\n\nwork  environment claim  based on  the same reasoning  as the\r\n\npre-Act deprivation of duties (a possible wrong but without a\r\n\nremedy).   The court  added one sentence  stating failure  to\r\n\nexhaust  as an alternative  ground for rejecting  this claim,\r\n\nbut we need not address that here because we affirm based  on\r\n\nDeNovellis's failure to  demonstrate a genuine issue  as to a\r\n\nsevere or pervasive hostile environment.   \r\n\n          Thus,  we  need not  reach  DeNovellis's exhaustion\r\n\nargument  because  we  uphold  the district  court's  summary\r\n\njudgment ruling  as to Title  VII and the  ADEA based  on its\r\n\nreasons other than exhaustion.  \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  The  government takes the position that the ADEA does not\r\nrequire  a  federal employee  to  exhaust his  administrative\r\nremedies.  The  Supreme Court has held,  in the context of  a\r\nprivate   employer,   that   \"filing  a   timely   charge  of\r\ndiscrimination   with  the  EEOC   is  not  a  jurisdictional\r\nprerequisite  to suit  in federal  court,  but a  requirement\r\nthat, like  a statute of  limitations, is subject  to waiver,\r\nestoppel,  and  equitable  tolling.\"   Zipes  v.

His  reasoning, however, is based on  a false premise.\r\n\nDeNovellis asserts that the district court \r\n\n          ruled as a matter of law that DeNovellis'\r\n          \"five-month  assignment  to  a  financial\r\n          position for  which he had  no background\r\n          was not  only a  set-up  for failure  but\r\n          also   an   adverse   employment  action\"\r\n          motivated by illegal discrimination based\r\n          upon age, race or ethnicity.\r\n\nThe  internal quotations  accurately  reproduce the  district\r\n\ncourt's conclusion as  to the legal  question of whether  the\r\n\nsham  assignment  constituted  an adverse  employment  action\r\n\nwithin the meaning  of Title VII and the  ADEA.  DeNovellis's\r\n\nassertion    after   the    internal   quotation,    however,\r\n\nmisrepresents what the district court found.  \r\n\n          The  court  held  that  DeNovellis  had   presented\r\n\nsufficient evidence on the intent issue  to survive a summary\r\n\njudgment motion as to his pre-Act deprivation of duties.  The\r\n\ncourt  did  not  make  a conclusive  factual  finding  as  to\r\n\ndiscriminatory intent; that question would be resolved by the\r\n\ntrier of fact if the matter went to trial.  The court granted\r\n\nthe Secretary's motion for summary judgment because the court\r\n\nfound that DeNovellis would not  be entitled to a remedy even\r\n\nif the case  went to trial and  he were able to  persuade the\r\n\n                             -33-\r                                          33\r\r\n\ntrier   of  fact  that  the  defendant  was  motivated  by  a\r\n\ndiscriminatory intent.\r\n\n          The difference between what the court actually held\r\n\nand what DeNovellis  claims it held is fatal  to his argument\r\n\nthat  the court  was  obligated to  award  him a  declaratory\r\n\njudgment and attorney's fees.8  If DeNovellis were correct in\r\n\nhis characterization of  the posture of the case  -- that the\r\n\ndistrict   court  had  already  made  a  factual  finding  of\r\n\ndiscriminatory  intent --  then the  court  would still  have\r\n\ndiscretion  as to whether  to grant declaratory  relief after\r\n\nfinding  discrimination  at   trial.    But  at   least  then\r\n\nDeNovellis  might be  able to persuade  us that  the district\r\n\ncourt abused its discretion in denying him declaratory relief\r\n\nand fees.  \r\n\n          The Declaratory  Judgment Act is \"an  enabling Act,\r\n\nwhich confers  a  discretion on  the  courts rather  than  an\r\n\nabsolute   right  upon  the   litigant\";  courts  have  broad\r\n\ndiscretion  to  decline  to  enter  a  declaratory  judgment.\r\n\nWilton v.

Wilton, 515  U.S. at  289.   Thus,  if the\r                                     \r\n\ndistrict  court  actually  found  discriminatory  intent   in\r\n\nDeNovellis's deprivation  of duties,  we might  or might  not\r\n\nfind that the denial of a  declaration to that effect was  an\r\n\nabuse  of  discretion.   Cf.  Metropolitan  Stevedore  Co. v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nRambo, 117  S.

The  court  faced the  possibility of\r\n\nconducting  a trial  in this  case,  assessing arguments  and\r\n\ncounter-arguments  as  to  what people  intended  by  certain\r\n\nstatements  or  actions,  with no  opportunity  to  award any\r\n\nrelief to DeNovellis that would remedy the harm  he allegedly\r\n\nsuffered.   After trial,  the court  might possibly have  the\r\n\nauthority  to enter  a declaration  that some  or all  of the\r\n\n                             -36-\r                                          36\r\r\n\ndefendant's    now-terminated    employment    actions   were\r\n\ndiscriminatory.    In  the circumstances  of  this  case, the\r\n\ndistrict  court's decision  -- prior to  trial --  to refrain\r\n\nfrom such a  fruitless endeavor was within  its discretionary\r\n\npower.

The district court granted summary\r\n\njudgment to the defendant.  We affirm.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n                           A. Facts\r                                               \r\n\n          Viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\r\n\nparty (DeNovellis) and  drawing all reasonable inferences  in\r\n\nhis favor,  the following facts are treated as undisputed for\r\n\npurposes of the motion for summary judgment.  DeNovellis is a\r\n\nwhite male of Italian descent.  He was sixty-six years old at\r\n\nthe time he filed this action in 1994.  \r\n\n          From  1979  to  1991 DeNovellis  served  as  Deputy\r\n\nRegional Administrator (DRA) of the Boston Regional Office of\r\n\nHuman  Development Services  (HDS), which  was  part of  HHS.\r\n\nDeNovellis's   position   was   eliminated   in   an   agency\r\n\nreorganization  that occurred in  the spring of  1991.  After\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nsome  months \"in limbo,\" in the form of temporary assignments\r\n\nto  \"meaningless\" positions,  DeNovellis  became the  program\r\n\nmanager of the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC)\r\n\nprogram  within   the  recently  formed   Administration  for\r\n\nChildren  and  Families  (ACF).    His  civil  service  grade\r\n\nremained the same:  GS-14.  \r\n\n          Until the reorganization,  DeNovellis's supervisor,\r\n\nA.  Kenton Williams, was  the Regional Administrator  (RA) of\r\n\nHDS.  Williams was a black male of the age of fifty-five when\r\n\nthis action  was filed.   There were  racial tensions  in the\r\n\noffice.   Williams  often spoke  out  against the  \"insidious\r\n\nracism  that  exists  in  our  society,\"  and,  according  to\r\n\nDeNovellis,  \"would try to justify the behavior and reactions\r\n\nof  black staff persons, who having  been subjected to racial\r\n\ndiscrimination  over  the  years,  reacted differently  under\r\n\ncertain circumstances.\"  Williams also wrote a  letter to the\r\n\neditor  of the  Boston Globe  commenting  on the  \"tremendous\r                                        \r\n\npressures\" faced by  black executives.  These  comments about\r\n\nthe  inequities  suffered  by  blacks  made  DeNovellis  feel\r\n\nuncomfortable. \r\n\n          There were  also ethnic  and race-related  comments\r\n\naround the  office that  Williams condoned.   Members  of the\r\n\nstaff would say things like  \"Vinnie, why don't you have your\r\n\npeople (Mafia) in  the North  End take care  of them.\"   (The\r\n\nNorth End is a largely Italian neighborhood of Boston.)  Both\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nWilliams and a black friend  of his, St. Clair Phillips, made\r\n\nnegative comments about  DeNovellis's ethnicity.   And  staff\r\n\nmembers made general references to \"you whites\" in Williams's\r\n\npresence.\r\n\n          Williams  and  DeNovellis   also  had  work-related\r\n\nconflicts.   Part  of DeNovellis's  job  as DRA  was to  take\r\n\ncharge  of the regional  activities during the  RA's absence.\r\n\nWilliams   was  often  absent  from  the  office  and  became\r\n\nconcerned that DeNovellis was signing  so much correspondence\r\n\non Williams's behalf that it would highlight the frequency of\r\n\nhis absences.   For this reason, Williams  ordered DeNovellis\r\n\nin 1989 to stop signing letters on his behalf.\r\n\n          In 1989 and  1990, other government administrators,\r\n\nincluding   Williams's  supervisor   in  Washington,   Pamela\r\n\nCoughlin,  who was white,  told Williams that  DeNovellis was\r\n\nspreading negative comments about Williams.  On more than one\r\n\noccasion, Williams also  had to intervene in  heated disputes\r\n\nthat DeNovellis  had with  other people in  the office.   One\r\n\nsuch incident  pertained to  the distribution  of space,  and\r\n\nanother concerned  whether a  minority student  (who did  not\r\n\nreport to DeNovellis) had been absent from work.\r\n\n          In 1990,  certain federal employees were  given the\r\n\nopportunity  to  choose  early  retirement.   DeNovellis  was\r\n\neligible  to retire but rejected  the offer.  Several people,\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nincluding  Williams and  two  of  his  black  friends,  urged\r\n\nDeNovellis to take this opportunity and retire.\r\n\n          The   heart   of  DeNovellis's   complaint   is  an\r\n\nassignment  to  a  temporary  \"detail\"  to  an \"unestablished\r\n\nposition\" in the Office of Fiscal Operations (OFO) in October\r\n\n1990.   Williams  claims  he was  instructed  to  order  this\r\n\nreassignment   by    Coughlin,   his    (white)   supervisor.\r\n\nNevertheless,  Williams now  admits that  the  detail was  \"a\r\n\nsham,\" and was  concocted in  part because  Williams did  not\r\n\nwant  DeNovellis to  be  his  deputy.   On  October 9,  1990,\r\n\nWilliams removed DeNovellis  from the order of  succession to\r\n\nact as RA.\r\n\n          DeNovellis suffered no diminution in grade, pay, or\r\n\nbenefits during the detail.  He worked under  the supervision\r\n\nof  Williams's friend,  St. Clair  Phillips,  who was  black.\r\n\nOfficially,   DeNovellis   was  responsible   for   financial\r\n\nactivities, for which he had  no training or capability.  For\r\n\nthe  first month  and a  half, he  \"performed the  same (DRA)\r\n\nduties under  a new  supervisor.\"  In  mid-November, the  new\r\n\nsupervisor,  Phillips,  asked  Williams  to  end  the  detail\r\n\nbecause DeNovellis did not have the background to perform the\r\n\nOFO work and he  was refusing to perform his old  DRA duties.\r\n\nWilliams refused.   The detail was due to  expire in February\r\n\n1991 but, upon Williams's request, was extended through March\r\n\n31, 1991.  \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n          On  March   8,  1991,   DeNovellis  filed   an  EEO\r\n\ncomplaint,  alleging   age,   race,   and   national   origin\r\n\ndiscrimination   in   assignment  of   duties,   awards,  and\r\n\nreassignment.  On April 11,  three days after the EEO officer\r\n\ninterviewed Williams,  Williams filed  forms requesting  that\r\n\nDeNovellis's position be switched with that of Paul Kelley, a\r\n\nblack  male who  was a  friend of  Williams's  and who  was a\r\n\nsupervisory  accountant in  OFO.    According to  DeNovellis,\r\n\nWilliams's purpose in making this request  was to protect the\r\n\ngrades of Phillips and Kelley, both black and both friends of\r\n\nhis, in  an impending  classification review.   However,  the\r\n\nclassification  review and the proposed \"job swap\" were never\r\n\ncarried out, overtaken  by the agency's restructuring  in the\r\n\nspring of 1991.\r\n\n          Around  the  same  time  that DeNovellis's  initial\r\n\ndetail expired  at the  end of March  1991, HHS  underwent an\r\n\ninternal  restructuring.   The former  HDS  and another  sub-\r\n\nagency of HHS, the Family Support Administration, were merged\r\n\ninto  a new  entity,  the  Administration  for  Children  and\r\n\nFamilies (ACF).   The  restructuring took  several months  to\r\n\neffectuate.  During the transition, DeNovellis maintained his\r\n\ntitle of DRA of HDS and carried out some tasks of  the Deputy\r\n\nposition, but he received no official assignments; as before,\r\n\npeople came to him for information.  \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n          In  April or May 1991, Hugh Galligan, a white male,\r\n\nwas appointed Acting  Regional Administrator of the  new ACF;\r\n\nhe appointed Williams as his Deputy.  By May, Williams was no\r\n\nlonger in charge  of the Boston office.   The appointments of\r\n\nGalligan and Williams were finalized on August 23, 1991.  Two\r\n\ndays  later,  DeNovellis's  position   was  \"realigned\";  his\r\n\nofficial title  remained  DRA of  HDS  (even though  HDS  was\r\n\nphasing out) but this was now within the new ACF.  The result\r\n\nwas that Williams was DRA of ACF, and DeNovellis retained the\r\n\njob  title \"DRA\" but  remained unassigned in  the new agency.\r\n\nHis grade remained unchanged throughout this period.\r\n\n          In   December  1991  Williams  left  Boston  for  a\r\n\nposition  in Washington,  D.C.    Galligan  then  transferred\r\n\nPhillips, who had  been the head of OFO of the new agency, to\r\n\nthe DRA position at  the new agency.  Because  Phillips was a\r\n\nGS-15 and  the new  DRA opening was  a GS-15,  Galligan could\r\n\ntransfer  Phillips  laterally  into  the  position without  a\r\n\ncompetitive search.  Since  DeNovellis was a GS-14,  he could\r\n\nnot have been promoted to Williams's former position unless a\r\n\njob  vacancy announcement  had been  made  and a  competitive\r\n\nsearch  performed.   There is no  evidence that  Galligan was\r\n\nprecluded  from instituting  such  a  search and  considering\r\n\nDeNovellis for the position.\r\n\n          In May 1992  DeNovellis was reassigned from  DRA of\r\n\nthe Office of Family Security  (OFS) in the new agency, to  a\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nsupervisory  position as  program manager  in  the same  OFS.\r\n\nThis  was not part of the management  team of the new agency.\r\n\nDeNovellis  was  the  last person  appointed  to  a permanent\r\n\nposition in the new agency.   Galligan has since detailed him\r\n\ntwice  to the  OFO as  an assistant  goal leader  for ongoing\r\n\nrestructuring.   (Thus, in  some respects, DeNovellis  claims\r\n\nhis job assignments have been inappropriate because they were\r\n\nbeneath  his DRA status  and in other  respects inappropriate\r\n\nbecause  the  positions  required   accounting  or  financial\r\n\nqualifications which he did not possess.)\r\n\n          According  to  DeNovellis,  at  least  part  of the\r\n\nreason for  the delay in  his reassignment in the  new agency\r\n\nwas a \"position  paper\" he  wrote in early  1992.  The  paper\r\n\npointed out the \"convoluted interactions that were going on,\"\r\n\nand  it accidently  was  mailed to  a  lot of  people  in the\r\n\nregion, creating a furor.  Galligan was asked to find out who\r\n\nwas   responsible  for  this  position  paper.    During  the\r\n\ninvestigation, DeNovellis's computer was confiscated.\r\n\n                             B.  \r\n\n                  District Court Proceedings\r                                                        \r\n\n          The district court granted  summary judgment to the\r\n\nSecretary as to all claims.

The  court concluded,\r\n\nessentially,  that  even   if  DeNovellis  was  discriminated\r\n\nagainst,  he was  not entitled  to any  remedy for  it.   The\r\n\nequitable remedies  available under  Title VII  prior to  the\r\n\n1991 Act were not appropriate  because he suffered no loss in\r\n\npay  or  loss   of  job  that  would  warrant   back  pay  or\r\n\nreinstatement (he did not  seek reinstatement).  And  the new\r\n\nremedies  made available under  the 1991 Act  (in particular,\r\n\ncompensatory  damages) are only available for acts which took\r\n\nplace after November 21, 1991, and therefore did not apply to\r\n\nDeNovellis's claims of pre-Act discrimination.1\r\n\n          The district  court rejected DeNovellis's  claim of\r\n\npost-Act  deprivation of  duties  based  on  his  failure  to\r\n\npresent sufficient evidence  to enable a reasonable  trier of\r\n\nfact   to  conclude  that  the  employer's  motive  for  such\r\n\ndeprivation was discriminatory.   Whereas DeNovellis provided\r\n\nindirect  evidence that Williams might have been motivated by\r\n\nimproper reasons  in making pre-Act assignments, Williams was\r\n\nno longer in charge of the  Boston office after May 1991  and\r\n\nhe left Boston  altogether in December 1991.   The court held\r\n\nthat  DeNovellis could not bootstrap the pre-May 1991 alleged\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The  court also  concluded that  such  remedies were  not\r\navailable under the  ADEA as a matter of  law, and DeNovellis\r\nhas not appealed that ruling.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\ndiscrimination  by Williams  into sufficient  evidence for  a\r\n\nreasonable  trier of fact to conclude that post-November 1991\r\n\ndecisions were animated by similar illegal bias. \r\n\n          DeNovellis  also  made  a  claim  of  hostile  work\r\n\nenvironment based  on  negative  comments  about  his  ethnic\r\n\nbackground  coupled with  his \"sham  detail.\"   The  district\r\n\ncourt rejected this claim for essentially the same reasons it\r\n\nrejected  the  deprivation  of duties  claims:    any pre-Act\r\n\nviolation was a wrong without a remedy based on Landgraf, and\r                                                                    \r\n\nthere   was   insufficient   evidence   that   any   post-Act\r\n\ndiscrimination  had  occurred.    The  court  stated  in  one\r\n\nsentence an alternative  ground for its  ruling:  failure  to\r\n\nexhaust administrative remedies.2\r\n\n          The district court also granted summary judgment to\r\n\nthe Secretary  on DeNovellis's  claim that  his computer  was\r\n\nconfiscated in retaliation for filing an EEO  complaint.  The\r\n\ncourt rejected this claim under  Title VII on the ground that\r\n\nDeNovellis  failed  to exhaust  his  administrative remedies,\r\n\nbecause  his EEO complaint alleged nothing about retaliation.\r\n\nThe court  rejected the retaliation  claim under ADEA  on the\r\n\nmerits (the  government had  waived exhaustion  as to  ADEA).\r\n\nThe court  concluded that  DeNovellis failed  to present  any\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  DeNovellis also presented  to the district court  a claim\r\nthat he  was  denied the  opportunity  to be  considered  for\r\npromotion to the  DRA position in the new  agency (ACF) after\r\nWilliams vacated  it in  December 1991.   He does  not pursue\r\nthis claim on appeal. \r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nevidence to establish  a causal connection between  his March\r\n\n1991 age discrimination  complaint against  Williams and  the\r\n\nFebruary  1992  confiscation  of  his  computer by  Galligan.\r\n\nDeNovellis does not appeal this conclusion.\r\n\n          DeNovellis  pursues  three   arguments  on  appeal:\r\n\n(1) that he  is entitled  to the  remedies delineated in  the\r\n\nCivil  Rights Act of  1991 because  his pre-Act  and post-Act\r\n\ndeprivation of duties  were part of one  continuing violation\r\n\nand the effects of his \"employment purgatory\" extended beyond\r\n\nthe effective  date of the  Act; (2) that the  district court\r\n\nerred in requiring him to exhaust his administrative remedies\r\n\nas to  post-detail deprivations  of duties  and hostile  work\r\n\nenvironment;  (3)  that  the district  court  was  obliged to\r\n\nprovide him  with a declaratory  judgment and/or an  award of\r\n\nattorney's fees.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n                      Standard of Review\r                                                    \r\n\n          We  review  grants  of  summary  judgment  de novo.\r\n\nDubois  v.

These  new\r\n\nprovisions,  however, do not  apply to conduct  that occurred\r\n\nbefore  the effective  date of  the Act,  November 21,  1991.\r\n\nLandgraf, 511 U.S. at 247, 286.\r                    \r\n\n          Applying Landgraf to the instant case, the district\r                                       \r\n\ncourt  concluded that, even  if DeNovellis were  to establish\r\n\nafter trial that  his sham detail and  employment \"purgatory\"\r\n\nviolated his rights under Title VII, he would not be entitled\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nto any  remedy.   This is because  the sham  detail ended  in\r\n\nMarch  1991, prior  to the  effective date  of the  1991 Act.\r\n\nTherefore,  even if  liability were found  after trial  as to\r\n\nthat detail, the only remedies that would have been available\r\n\nto DeNovellis  were equitable,  such  as reinstatement,  back\r\n\npay, or  an injunction.   As the district court  analyzed the\r\n\nremedies for  pre-Act conduct:  because  DeNovellis \"suffered\r\n\nno loss of pay, he may  not recover back pay; because he  did\r\n\nnot quit  his job, he does not  seek reinstatement.  There is\r\n\nno possibility  of  enjoining Williams  from  future  details\r\n\nbecause he  is no longer  in the office, and  DeNovellis does\r\n\nnot  seek  an injunction  against  details by  Galligan.   In\r\n\nshort, the five-month detail ending in the spring of 1991, if\r\n\nbased  upon illegal  discrimination, was  a  wrong without  a\r\n\nremedy.\"    As to  the  post-Act deprivation  of  duties, the\r\n\ndistrict  court  found  insufficient  evidence  to  create  a\r\n\ntriable issue as  to discriminatory intent.   DeNovellis does\r\n\nnot directly appeal the latter determination.\r\n\n          Instead, DeNovellis takes  issue with both rulings,\r\n\npre-Act  and  post-Act,  by essentially  conflating  the two.\r\n\nDeNovellis argues  that he  was  the victim  of a  continuing\r\n\nviolation  that began before November 21, 1991, and continued\r\n\nthereafter, entitling him  to compensatory damages under  the\r\n\n1991  Act.  A related  continuing violation argument has been\r\n\napplied   to  other   time   requirements  imposed   by   the\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nantidiscrimination laws,4 but the  theory on which DeNovellis\r\n\nbases his argument is not one that the courts have approved.\r\n\n          We  have   delineated  two   types  of   continuing\r\n\nviolation cases:   systemic and serial.

Nor could he:  the  record in this case presents\r\n\nqualitatively different  scenarios  for the  pre-Act and  the\r\n\npost-Act  periods.  The  district court correctly  found that\r\n\nthere was enough  evidence of possible  discriminatory animus\r\n\nbetween Williams  and DeNovellis that  a jury could  find the\r\n\npre-Act detail was  motivated by discrimination and  not mere\r\n\npersonality  differences or cronyism.   But once  that detail\r\n\nended and  Williams was no  longer in charge of  the Regional\r\n\nOffice, the reasons for DeNovellis's assignments were neither\r\n\nanalogous nor part of the  same pattern or series.  There  is\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\nprecious little  evidence or inference  to get to a  trier of\r\n\nfact  on   discriminatory  motive  for   post-Act  employment\r\n\ndecisions.  Of course, discrimination is not precluded merely\r\n\nbecause  Williams was no longer in charge.  Nor does the fact\r\n\nthat  Galligan is white insulate the  defendant from a charge\r\n\nthat  Galligan's actions were motivated  by race.  After all,\r\n\nfor  the  first  eight  months of  Galligan's  tenure  as RA,\r\n\nWilliams was  Galligan's deputy.  Galligan, as the new person\r\n\nin the  office, might  very well have  given great  weight to\r\n\nWilliams's    allegedly    biased    recommendations    about\r\n\nreassignment    of   subordinate    personnel   during    the\r\n\nreorganization, transition, and realignments.  But DeNovellis\r\n\npresented no  evidence of  such discriminatory taint,  either\r\n\ndirectly or by inference.  \r\n\n          Indeed,  there   is  evidence   to  the   contrary.\r\n\nBureaucratic  delays arising  from the  reorganization, which\r\n\nindisputably  had nothing  to  do  with  DeNovellis  or  with\r\n\ninvidious  characteristics,  overtook  DeNovellis's  personal\r\n\nsituation.   Further, at  his  deposition, DeNovellis  denied\r\n\nthat  any of Galligan's  actions were motivated  by invidious\r\n\ndiscrimination   in  any   decision  affecting   DeNovellis's\r\n\nemployment.  And DeNovellis  himself attributed a significant\r\n\npart of the delay in assigning him to a permanent position in\r\n\nthe  new agency to his own error  in judgment:  the \"position\r\n\npaper\" that he wrote and  widely disseminated.  The  district\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\ncourt  correctly concluded  that  the  record  in  this  case\r\n\ncontains  virtually  no  evidence  of  post-Act   violations.\r\n\nTherefore,  DeNovellis  cannot  rely  on  a serial  violation\r\n\ntheory to defeat the Secretary's motion for summary judgment.\r\n\n                    B.  Continuing Effects\r                                                      \r\n\n          DeNovellis also argues another theory to circumvent\r\n\nLandgraf:   that the  pre-Act sham  assignment constituted  a\r                    \r\n\ncontinuing   violation   through  its   continuing   effects.\r\n\nAlthough the assignment itself was a discrete action that was\r\n\nover  and  done  with before  November  21,  1991, DeNovellis\r\n\nemphasizes  that  its  effects  continued  into  the post-Act\r                                          \r\n\nperiod.  According to DeNovellis, these post-Act effects turn\r\n\nthe pre-Act discrimination into  a continuing violation  that\r\n\ncontinued  post-Act,   thereby  triggering  the   1991  Act's\r\n\nremedies.   But continuing effects, without  additional post-\r\n\nAct  discriminatory actions, do  not turn a  discrete pre-Act\r\n\ndecision into  a continuing violation.

As\r\n\npreviously noted, the fact that  DeNovellis remained assigned\r\n\nto  \"purgatory\" cannot constitute  a post-Act violation, even\r\n\nthough the effects of that assignment decision were prolonged\r\n\ninto the post-Act period by the bureaucratic delays emanating\r\n\nfrom the  agency's reorganization.   See  Evans, 431  U.S. at\r                                                           \r\n\n558; see Part III.A., supra.\r                                       \r\n\n          DeNovellis correctly points out that the court must\r\n\nfocus on the work atmosphere as a whole, and not separate out\r\n\neach  demeaning  work  assignment  or  derogatory remark  for\r\n\nindividual   analysis.    See   Vance,  863  F.2d   at  1510.\r                                                 \r\n\nNevertheless,  the  question is  whether  he produced  enough\r\n\nevidence on  the entire summary  judgment record to  enable a\r\n\nreasonable  trier  of  fact  to  find  a  cognizable  hostile\r\n\nenvironment claim.  We agree  with the district court that he\r\n\ndid not. \r\n\n          Williams and  others  at HHS  apparently made  some\r\n\nscattered  comments  that  could  be  construed  as  evincing\r\n\n                             -28-\r                                          28\r\r\n\nracial,  ethnic, or age-based hostility, although some of the\r\n\ncomments   in  the  record  were  not  made  in  DeNovellis's\r\n\npresence.  DeNovellis does not argue that these comments were\r\n\nsevere  or pervasive, nor does he claim that they rise to the\r\n\nlevel of sufficiency necessary to make out a prima facie case\r\n\nof harassment.  Rather, he appears to offer them as probative\r\n\nof discriminatory motive underlying his job assignments.\r\n\n          The  major  aspect  of his  work  environment  that\r\n\nDeNovellis  claims was  hostile or  \"harassing\"  was his  so-\r\n\ncalled \"employment purgatory\" of job assignments to positions\r\n\nhe considered to be unfit for his level of qualification.  As\r\n\nalready  noted, the  \"hostile\"  aspect  of  remaining  in  an\r\n\nundesirable  job  assignment  is  not  akin  to  a  pervasive\r\n\nenvironment  claim; it  is  a  discrete employment  decision,\r\n\nhowever adverse it may  be.  Even when this  is combined with\r\n\nthe derogatory comments, we do not think a fact-finder, based\r\n\non  this record, could  reasonably conclude that DeNovellis's\r\n\nwork environment was so pervaded with  racial, ethnic, or age\r\n\ndiscrimination  so as to constitute a violation of Title VII.\r\n\n          That DeNovellis would  be left without a  remedy if\r\n\nwe affirm  the district court's decision is  not a sufficient\r\n\nreason to  warrant reversal.   The Court in Landgraf  was not\r                                                                \r\n\nmoved  by petitioner's argument  there that, \"if  she [could]\r\n\nnot obtain damages pursuant to [the 1991 Act], she [would] be\r\n\nleft  remediless despite an  adjudged violation of  her right\r\n\n                             -29-\r                                          29\r\r\n\nunder Title VII to be free of workplace discrimination.\"  511\r\n\nU.S. at 285  n.38.  As the  Court put it, Title  VII \"did not\r\n\ncreate   a   'general   right   to   sue'    for   employment\r\n\ndiscrimination, but instead specified a set of 'circumscribed\r\n\nremedies,'\"  and \"[u]ntil the  1991 amendment, the  Title VII\r\n\nscheme did not allow for damages.  We are not free to fashion\r\n\nremedies  that  Congress  has   specifically  chosen  not  to\r\n\nextend.\"  Id. (quoting United  States v.

DeNovellis's lack  of a remedy (even  if there\r\n\nwere a violation) is a result of the way Congress had drafted\r\n\nTitle VII  prior to the  1991 Act; whatever  unfairness arose\r\n\nfrom that  limited remedial  scheme  affected all  plaintiffs\r\n\nsuing under it.  \r\n\n                             IV.\r\n\n            Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies\r                                                             \r\n\n          DeNovellis argues that the district  court erred in\r\n\ndismissing his post-detail deprivation of duties  and hostile\r\n\nenvironment  claims   because  he  failed   to  exhaust   his\r\n\nadministrative   remedies.     DeNovellis  misconstrues   the\r\n\ndistrict court's decision.   The court did  not grant summary\r\n\njudgment   against  him  based  on  his  failure  to  exhaust\r\n\nadministrative  remedies.    With  respect  to  the  post-Act\r\n\ndeprivation  of  duties  the district  court  stated  that \"a\r\n\nstrong argument\" could be made  that he has not exhausted his\r\n\nTitle  VII claim,  but the  court did  not decide  the issue.\r\n\n                             -30-\r                                          30\r\r\n\nMoreover, with respect to his claim under the ADEA, the court\r\n\nnoted  that  the   government  had   waived  any   exhaustion\r\n\nargument.7     The  district   court  decided   the  post-Act\r\n\ndeprivation  of duties  claim on  the  basis that  DeNovellis\r\n\nfailed   to  produce   evidence  to   support   a  claim   of\r\n\ndiscrimination, sufficient to withstand summary judgment.\r\n\n          The  district court  rejected DeNovellis's  hostile\r\n\nwork  environment claim  based on  the same reasoning  as the\r\n\npre-Act deprivation of duties (a possible wrong but without a\r\n\nremedy).   The court  added one sentence  stating failure  to\r\n\nexhaust  as an alternative  ground for rejecting  this claim,\r\n\nbut we need not address that here because we affirm based  on\r\n\nDeNovellis's failure to  demonstrate a genuine issue  as to a\r\n\nsevere or pervasive hostile environment.   \r\n\n          Thus,  we  need not  reach  DeNovellis's exhaustion\r\n\nargument  because  we  uphold  the district  court's  summary\r\n\njudgment ruling  as to Title  VII and the  ADEA based  on its\r\n\nreasons other than exhaustion.  \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  The  government takes the position that the ADEA does not\r\nrequire  a  federal employee  to  exhaust his  administrative\r\nremedies.  The  Supreme Court has held,  in the context of  a\r\nprivate   employer,   that   \"filing  a   timely   charge  of\r\ndiscrimination   with  the  EEOC   is  not  a  jurisdictional\r\nprerequisite  to suit  in federal  court,  but a  requirement\r\nthat, like  a statute of  limitations, is subject  to waiver,\r\nestoppel,  and  equitable  tolling.\"   Zipes  v.

His  reasoning, however, is based on  a false premise.\r\n\nDeNovellis asserts that the district court \r\n\n          ruled as a matter of law that DeNovellis'\r\n          \"five-month  assignment  to  a  financial\r\n          position for  which he had  no background\r\n          was not  only a  set-up  for failure  but\r\n          also   an   adverse   employment  action\"\r\n          motivated by illegal discrimination based\r\n          upon age, race or ethnicity.\r\n\nThe  internal quotations  accurately  reproduce the  district\r\n\ncourt's conclusion as  to the legal  question of whether  the\r\n\nsham  assignment  constituted  an adverse  employment  action\r\n\nwithin the meaning  of Title VII and the  ADEA.  DeNovellis's\r\n\nassertion    after   the    internal   quotation,    however,\r\n\nmisrepresents what the district court found.  \r\n\n          The  court  held  that  DeNovellis  had   presented\r\n\nsufficient evidence on the intent issue  to survive a summary\r\n\njudgment motion as to his pre-Act deprivation of duties.  The\r\n\ncourt  did  not  make  a conclusive  factual  finding  as  to\r\n\ndiscriminatory intent; that question would be resolved by the\r\n\ntrier of fact if the matter went to trial.  The court granted\r\n\nthe Secretary's motion for summary judgment because the court\r\n\nfound that DeNovellis would not  be entitled to a remedy even\r\n\nif the case  went to trial and  he were able to  persuade the\r\n\n                             -33-\r                                          33\r\r\n\ntrier   of  fact  that  the  defendant  was  motivated  by  a\r\n\ndiscriminatory intent.\r\n\n          The difference between what the court actually held\r\n\nand what DeNovellis  claims it held is fatal  to his argument\r\n\nthat  the court  was  obligated to  award  him a  declaratory\r\n\njudgment and attorney's fees.8  If DeNovellis were correct in\r\n\nhis characterization of  the posture of the case  -- that the\r\n\ndistrict   court  had  already  made  a  factual  finding  of\r\n\ndiscriminatory  intent --  then the  court  would still  have\r\n\ndiscretion  as to whether  to grant declaratory  relief after\r\n\nfinding  discrimination  at   trial.    But  at   least  then\r\n\nDeNovellis  might be  able to persuade  us that  the district\r\n\ncourt abused its discretion in denying him declaratory relief\r\n\nand fees.  \r\n\n          The Declaratory  Judgment Act is \"an  enabling Act,\r\n\nwhich confers  a  discretion on  the  courts rather  than  an\r\n\nabsolute   right  upon  the   litigant\";  courts  have  broad\r\n\ndiscretion  to  decline  to  enter  a  declaratory  judgment.\r\n\nWilton v.
