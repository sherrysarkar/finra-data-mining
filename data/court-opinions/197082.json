Plaintiff Joseph Vecchio brought suit under\r                           \r\n\n42 U.S.C.   1983 against Angelo LaMonica, the chief of police\r\n\nof  the  Winthrop  Police  Department.   The  district  court\r\n\ngranted  summary judgment  for  LaMonica on  all the  federal\r\n\nclaims and remanded Vecchio's  two remaining state law claims\r\n\nto state court.  We affirm.\r\n\n     The  primary target  of  Vecchio's  suit was  LaMonica's\r\n\nadministrative action in suspending Vecchio's  gun license --\r\n\na matter  typically  challenged and  resolved  through  state\r\n\nremedies.  This occurred because of Vecchio's alleged failure\r\n\nto comply  with a  state statutory requirement  that he  give\r\n\nnotice  of his change of address.  Although Vecchio says that\r\n\nthe state statute has been misconstrued, state remedies exist\r\n\nto redress any  such mistake,  and nothing here  points to  a\r\n\nconstitutional violation.   See Cross v.  Cunningham, 87 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n586, 589 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\n\n     Vecchio has also asserted,  as a civil rights violation,\r\n\nwhat  appears  to   be  a  garden-variety   defamation  claim\r\n\nconcerning the posting in the police  station of an anonymous\r\n\nletter  that accuses Vecchio of dealing drugs.  But there was\r\n\nno  evidence before  the  district court  to  show that  this\r\n\nletter was  created by,  or  at the  direction of,  LaMonica.\r\n\nThus, summary  judgment  was properly  granted even  assuming\r\n\n(dubitante) that any constitutional claim might otherwise  be\r                      \r\n\nstated.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\n     Despite the spirited  efforts of  LaMonica's counsel  on\r\n\nappeal, we  are  satisfied that  nothing  in this  case  even\r\n\nremotely approaches the type of government conduct that gives\r\n\nrise to a section 1983 action for due process violations.\r\n\n     Affirmed. \r                         \r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n",
