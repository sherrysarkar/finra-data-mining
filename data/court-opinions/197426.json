See Stevens  v. Bangor &amp; Aroostook R.R.,  97 F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\n594, 596 (1st Cir. 1996).  Gail Moulton,  plaintiff's mother,\r\n\npurchased  a Rival Model 3207  electric potpourri pot.  Water\r\n\nand dried flowers or scented liquid and wax are heated in the\r\n\npot  and  allowed  to evaporate  to  perfume  the  air.   The\r\n\npotpourri  pot  was a  modified  version of  a  Rival kitchen\r\n\nproduct, a one-quart slow cooker.  The cover of the potpourri\r\n\npot could not be  secured to the  pot and had  a hole in  its\r\n\ncenter,   approximately  one  and  three-quarters  inches  in\r\n\ndiameter,  to allow fragrance to escape.  The date Rival sold\r\n\nthis particular potpourri pot is not known.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\n          Literature accompanying the  pot contained  several\r\n\nwarnings,  including:  \"Close  supervision is  necessary when\r\n\nany appliance is  used by  or near children.\"   Mrs.  Moulton\r\n\nread the  instructions and warnings and  placed the potpourri\r\n\npot under  a table  in a  corner of  the  living room  hidden\r\n\nbehind pottery and baskets.   In February 1995, she  left her\r\n\none-year-old son Christopher in the living room while she got\r\n\nhim a drink from  the adjoining kitchen.   She heard a  noise\r\n\nand returned to the living room to find  the child sitting on\r\n\nthe floor in a pool of liquid.  The cover was off the pot, in\r\n\nthe puddle of liquid potpourri.  She did not notice where the\r\n\npot itself was.\r\n\n          No one knows exactly how the accident happened.  It\r\n\nis reasonable  to conclude either  that the pot  tipped over,\r\n\nspilling  the heated liquid, or that the child took the cover\r\n\noff.   In any event, the  lid came off  the pot, and  the hot\r\n\nliquid came into contact with the child's arm and hand.\r\n\n          Plaintiff's  left hand and arm were severely burned\r\n\nin the accident.  He spent over a month at the Shriners Burns\r\n\nHospital in  Boston undergoing extensive treatment.   He will\r\n\nneed extensive  medical treatment  in the  future.   His left\r\n\nhand  and arm are entirely covered by scar tissue, which does\r\n\nnot grow like normal skin.  As he grows,  the inflexible scar\r\n\ntissue must be released by surgical incisions to  prevent his\r\n\njoints from growing  abnormally; skin grafts are used to fill\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nin the gaps, and  a physical therapy regimen is  necessary to\r\n\nrestore  movement to the hand.  This cycle of growth, surgery\r\n\nand physical therapy will  continue until the plaintiff stops\r\n\ngrowing, at around age twenty.\r\n\n          The  type   of  potpourri   pot  involved  in   the\r\n\nplaintiff's accident  evolved from earlier products.   Rival,\r\n\nwhich manufactures various  household appliances, decided  to\r\n\nmarket an electric potpourri pot.  Before placing the item on\r\n\nthe  market, Rival  submitted the  item, which it  called the\r\n\nModel  3207,  for  evaluation  by  Underwriters  Laboratories\r\n\n(\"UL\"),  an  independent  not-for-profit  testing  laboratory\r\n\nwhich sets  and publishes  safety standards; these  standards\r\n\nare  often   adopted  by  the  American   National  Standards\r\n\nInstitute.\r\n\n          UL  replied that the pot did  not meet the relevant\r\n\nsafety standards.   UL sent Rival a letter in June 1987 which\r\n\nstated that the potpourri  pot heated liquids to temperatures\r\n\nexceeding the applicable standard,  and noted that, since the\r\n\nlid had no  means of being  secured and had  a one and  three\r\n\nquarters inch hole in its center, it could not be relied upon\r\n\nas  a barrier to prevent  scalding.  UL  therefore refused to\r\n\n\"list\" the  pot.1   However, by  the time  the UL  report was\r\n\nissued,  Rival  had already  set  production  to commence  in\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  A \"listed\"  product would bear a  sticker indicating that\r\nthe  laboratory  had  determined   that  the  product  met  a\r\nparticular safety standard.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nAugust 1987.   Despite UL's  rejection, Rival  decided to  go\r\n\nahead with its production plans anyway.\r\n\n          Rival submitted  the potpourri pot  to ETL  testing\r\n\nlaboratories,  a  commercial (for  profit)  laboratory.   ETL\r\n\nissued a  report certifying  that the  potpourri pot  met the\r\n\nvery  standard that UL had  reported the pot  failed to meet.\r\n\nThe ETL report should have raised concerns on its face.   The\r\n\nstated temperature  in  the report  to which  the pot  heated\r\n\nliquids  was too high to  meet the applicable  standard.  The\r\n\nproduct was nonetheless put on the market.\r\n\n          The  Model 3207  potpourri pot  was the  only Rival\r\n\nproduct not  listed by  UL.   This apparently  troubled Rival\r\n\nofficials.   They ordered various tests  to determine whether\r\n\nthe  item  could be  modified  to  meet the  evolving  safety\r\n\nstandards  adopted by  UL.   Rival's product  safety engineer\r\n\nreported that UL  had determined that  water hotter than  149\r\n\ndegrees  Farenheit could cause serious skin  burns on contact\r\n\nand  that  the  potpourri   pot  was  designed  to  reach   a\r\n\ntemperature of 174 degrees  Farenheit.  Rival was  also aware\r\n\nthat UL took  the position that this product,  unlike cooking\r\n\nappliances, was  likely to  be \"touched, bumped,  handled, or\r\n\neven upset  when used as intended.\"   Consequently, UL wanted\r\n\nlimitations  placed on  the temperature  and quantity  of the\r\n\nliquid and  wanted a tight-fitting lid.   Rival's competitors\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nproduced  potpourri  pots with  locking  lids.   However,  no\r\n\nmodifications were made to the Model 3207.\r\n\n          After the potpourri pot had  been on the market for\r\n\na  short  time,  Rival  began  to  receive  reports  of young\r\n\nchildren  who  were burned  by  accidental  contact with  the\r\n\nheated potpourri mixture.2   Rival still made no modification\r\n\nto the design.   After 1991, the company changed  the package\r\n\ninsert  to warn  consumers that the  contents of the pot were\r\n\nhot  and that  the pot  should be  kept out  of the  reach of\r\n\nchildren.3  Accidents continued to occur in the early 1990's.\r\n\nAt some point, although the parties cannot pinpoint the exact\r\n\ndate, a tag warning that the product could cause burns to the\r\n\nskin was  placed on  the cord  of the Model  3206, a  smaller\r\n\nversion of the Model 3207 that lacked any cover.\r\n\n                              II\r\n\n          Plaintiff  filed suit against  the Rival Company in\r\n\nNovember 1995  in  federal court  in  Maine.   The  complaint\r\n\nalleged  that   Rival  was   legally   responsible  for   the\r\n\nplaintiff's  injuries  because  (1)  the  potpourri  pot  was\r\n\ndefective  and  unreasonably dangerous  as  a  result of  its\r\n\ndesign; (2)  Rival was  negligent in designing  the potpourri\r\n\npot and/or in failing  to warn users of the  product's design\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Some of the accidents involved  the Model 3207 (the model\r\nin this case), while others involved a similar model.\r\n\n3.  The  previous  warning  had  stated  that  users   should\r\nsupervise closely when the pot was operated near children.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\ndefect;  and  (3)  the potpourri  pot  failed  to perform  in\r\n\naccordance  with the express warranty.  Rival defended on the\r\n\ngrounds  that   the  product  was  safe,   the  warnings  and\r\n\ninstructions  adequate, and  the blame  for the  accident lay\r\n\nwith the child's  mother for  placing the pot  where her  son\r\n\ncould reach it and then leaving him unattended.\r\n\n          After  a   one-week  trial,   the  jury   found  in\r\n\nplaintiff's  favor  on the  strict  liability  and negligence\r\n\nclaims and awarded him $2.2 million in compensatory damages.\r\n\n                             III\r\n\nPost-Sale Duty to Warn\r                                  \r\n\n          The primary  issue raised  by Rival is  whether the\r\n\ndistrict  court erred  in instructing  the jury  on negligent\r\n\npost-sale duty to warn.  The trial judge charged: \r\n\n          When a  manufacturer learns . .  . of the\r\n          dangers  associated  with the  reasonably\r\n          foreseeable use of its product after they\r\n          are  distributed,  the manufacturer  must\r\n          take reasonable steps to  warn reasonably\r\n          foreseeable  users  about  those  dangers\r\n          . . . .\r\n\nRival  argues that the Maine Law Court has never imposed such\r\n\na post-sale duty on manufacturers  and would not do so.   The\r\n\nplaintiff  responds   that  the  majority   of  jurisdictions\r\n\nrecognize a negligence-based post-sale duty to warn and that,\r\n\nif faced with the issue, Maine would do the same.\r\n\n          We  do not reach the issue of whether the Maine Law\r\n\nCourt  would recognize  a negligence-based post-sale  duty to\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nwarn because the  jury verdict is  adequately supported on  a\r\n\nstrict liability  claim    and  the  damages  are  the  same.\r\n\nFurther, no  issues concerning the  admissibility of evidence\r\n\nturn on this.\r\n\n          The trial  court separated  the theories of  strict\r\n\nliability,  negligence   and  warranty   both  in   the  jury\r\n\ninstructions  and  in the  special  verdict form.    The jury\r\n\nstated  on  the  special  verdict  form  that  it  found  the\r\n\ndefendant liable on a strict liability theory as well as on a\r\n\nnegligence  theory.    Even  if  the  instructions  involving\r\n\nnegligent post-sale duty  to warn were incorrect as  a matter\r\n\nof  Maine  law,  the  finding  of  liability  on  the  strict\r\n\nliability theory would be sufficient to support the judgment.\r\n\n          Rival  maintains  the  issue  must  nevertheless be\r\n\nreached.   It argues that  certain evidence  was admitted  at\r\n\ntrial in  support of  the plaintiff's  theory that there  had\r\n\nbeen a negligent failure  to warn and that this  evidence was\r\n\nboth  prejudicial and  irrelevant to  any of the  other legal\r\n\ntheories  advanced by  plaintiff.   The evidence  in question\r\n\nconcerns  what  the  defendant terms  a  subsequent  remedial\r\n\nmeasure: the  placement of  a warning  tag on  the electrical\r\n\ncord of the Model 3206 (which  is smaller than the Model 3207\r\n\nand  does not have a cover).4   The defendant argues that if,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  This modification  is not  a subsequent  remedial measure\r\nfor  purposes of Rule 407  of the Federal  Rules of Evidence.\r\nThat rule  does not  apply where,  as here, the  modification\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nas it claims, Maine would not recognize a negligent post-sale\r\n\nduty  to  warn, this  evidence  was  improperly admitted  and\r\n\nsufficiently  prejudicial  to  warrant   a  new  trial.    We\r\n\ndisagree.\r\n\n          First, the  trial court ruled that  the warning tag\r\n\nevidence  was relevant to the issue of whether there had been\r\n\na negligent violation  of a pre-sale duty to  warn as well as\r\n\nof a post-sale duty  to warn.  Although  the sequence of  the\r\n\nplacement of the warning  tags and the sale of  the appliance\r\n\nis unknown,  the defendant never  challenged this evidentiary\r\n\nruling as to the pre-sale duty to warn.  The point is waived.\r\n\n          Furthermore,  even assuming  arguendo  that it  was\r\n\nerror  to admit  the \"cord tag\"  evidence, \"the  standard for\r\n\nreviewing  a district  court's nonconstitutional  error in  a\r\n\ncivil suit requires that we find such error harmless if it is\r\n\nhighly  probable that the error did not affect the outcome of\r\n\nthe case.\"  Harrison v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 981 F.2d 25, 29\r                                                        \r\n\n(1st  Cir. 1992).      Here,  there  was  ample  evidence  of\r\n\ndefective  design:   the  pot   heated  its  contents   to  a\r\n\ndangerously  high temperature and did not have a locking lid.\r\n\nSimilar  products  produced by  other  companies  did have  a\r\n\nlocking  lid.   The  refusal of  UL to  list  the product  is\r\n\nparticularly telling.  We think it unlikely that the evidence\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\npreceded  the accident involved in the  current lawsuit.

The\r                                 \r\n\ndefendant  argues  that   there  is  insufficient  similarity\r\n\nbetween  the  earlier  accidents  and  plaintiff's  accident,\r\n\nbecause   the  circumstances  surrounding   the  spills  were\r\n\ndifferent.  For example,  in one of the earlier  accidents, a\r\n\nchild  knocked over  the table  where the  potpourri  pot was\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nlocated; in four others, a child became entangled in the cord\r\n\nand pulled the pot  over.  Furthermore, two of  the accidents\r\n\ninvolved the Model 3206, a smaller pot with no cover at all.\r\n\n          \"Substantial  similarity\"  is  a  function  of  the\r\n\ntheory of  the case.   See Ponder  v. Warren Tool  Corp., 834\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d  1553, 1560 (10th Cir.  1987).  Here,  the plaintiff was\r\n\nburned  by a  large quantity  of hot  liquid escaping  from a\r\n\npotpourri  pot without a  locking lid.   Plaintiff sought the\r\n\nintroduction of the evidence  of the other accidents to  show\r\n\nthat  the product as designed  allowed the rapid  escape of a\r\n\nsignificant  amount5 of  extremely  hot liquid  and was  thus\r\n\ndefective.  Cf. Jackson  v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber  Co., 788\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 1070, 1083 (5th Cir. 1986).  Under these  circumstances,\r\n\nthere  was no  abuse of  discretion.   Cf. P.B.  Mutrie Motor\r                                                                         \r\n\nTransp., Inc.  v. Interchemical  Corp., 378 F.2d  447, 450-51\r                                                  \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1967).\r\n\nMedical Costs\r                         \r\n\n          Plaintiff  presented  the  expert  testimony  of  a\r\n\nrehabilitation  specialist as  to  the  cost  of  plaintiff's\r\n\nfuture medical and rehabilitation needs.  Rival says that the\r\n\nwitness was  not qualified and  that his testimony  lacked an\r\n\nadequate factual basis.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  Even electric potpourri pots with locking lids will allow\r\nthe escape  of at  least  a very  small amount  of liquid  if\r\ntipped  over; the appliance  must have openings  to allow the\r\nfragrance to escape.\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\n          A trial court  has wide  discretion in  determining\r\n\nthe admissibility  of expert  testimony, and we  will reverse\r\n\nits  decision only  when  there has  been  a clear  abuse  of\r\n\ndiscretion.   Stevens, 97 F.3d  at 600.   The educational and\r                                 \r\n\nwork experience of plaintiff's expert made him well-qualified\r\n\nto testify concerning theplaintiff's future medical expenses.\r\n\n          A somewhat  closer question is whether  there was a\r\n\nsufficient  factual basis  for the  expert testimony.   Under\r\n\nMaine  law,   damages  may  not  be  recovered  if  they  are\r\n\ncontingent  or speculative.   Michaud  v. Steckino,  390 A.2d\r                                                              \r\n\n524,  530  (Me.  1978).    They  must  be  \"determined  to  a\r\n\nprobability.\"  Id.\r                              \r\n\n          Rival  makes  a  two-pronged argument.    It  first\r\n\nclaims  that the plaintiff failed to meet his burden of proof\r\n\non  the damages issue, because everyone  involved in the case\r\n\nexpects  that the  Shriners Hospital,  which is  treating the\r\n\nchild,  will continue to  provide all necessary  care free of\r\n\ncharge.  This argument is foreclosed by the collateral source\r\n\nrule.   Under that rule, a plaintiff who has been compensated\r\n\nin whole or in part by a source independent of the tortfeasor\r\n\nis  nevertheless  entitled to  a  full  recovery against  the\r\n\ntortfeasor,  to  prevent   the  tortfeasor  from  gaining   a\r\n\nwindfall.  Werner v. Lane, 393 A.2d 1329, 1335 (Me. 1978).\r                                     \r\n\n          Defendant then argues that the plaintiff has failed\r\n\nto prove  future medical  expenses to a  reasonable certainty\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nbecause  the testimony  of plaintiff's  rehabilitation expert\r\n\nwas   different  from  that   of  the   plaintiff's  treating\r\n\nphysician.   Plaintiff's  rehabilitation expert  presented an\r\n\nitemized  list of predicted future medical and rehabilitation\r\n\nexpenses.   The plaintiff's treating physician testified that\r\n\nit  was  impossible  to  predict  the  number  or   types  of\r\n\nprocedures the plaintiff  will need in the future because the\r\n\nneed  for future care  will depend on  the plaintiff's growth\r\n\npattern  and how the plaintiff improves over time.  There was\r\n\nan   adequate  foundation  for  the  rehabilitation  expert's\r\n\ntestimony and the jury was therefore  free to credit it.  Cf.\r                                                                         \r\n\nStevens, 97 F.3d at 600.\r                   \r\n\n          As to  the misstatement  by plaintiff's  counsel in\r\n\nclosing, when he mentioned \"out of pocket\" expenses, any harm\r\n\nwas  ameliorated  by  the  trial court's  immediate  curative\r\n\ninstruction.  See Conde  v. Starlight I, Inc., 103  F.3d 210,\r                                                         \r\n\n213 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\n\nTestimony of Rival's President\r                                          \r\n\n          Defendant claims  it was sandbagged when, at trial,\r\n\nplaintiff made use of a statement by a Rival official, from a\r\n\ndeposition  in another  case, to  impeach defendant's  expert\r\n\nwitness.  Defendant argues it had no opportunity to place the\r\n\ncompany  official's statement  in its  proper context.   This\r\n\nargument is  not well taken.  The defendant did not request a\r\n\ncontinuance  or  any  limiting  instructions.    Under  these\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\ncircumstances, we cannot say the trial  court abused its wide\r\n\ndiscretion in admitting this evidence.\r\n\nSufficiency of the Evidence\r                                       \r\n\n          Finally,   the  defendant  argues  that  the  trial\r\n\ncourt's  denials of its Rule  50(b) motion for  judgment as a\r\n\nmatter of  law and of  its motion for  a new trial  should be\r\n\nreversed.   It claims  that the  evidence, together with  all\r\n\nreasonable   inferences   in   the   plaintiff's   favor,  is\r\n\ninsufficient to support the verdict.  Review is de novo.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nLama v. Borras, 16 F.3d 473, 477 (1st Cir. 1994).\r                          \r\n\n          The defendant  maintains  that no  reasonable  jury\r\n\ncould find that any  action by Rival was the  proximate cause\r\n\nof the plaintiff's injury.  The defendant points to the Maine\r\n\nLaw  Court's  statement  that \"a  product  bearing  .  . .  a\r\n\nwarning,  which is safe for use if [the warning] is followed,\r\n\nis  not  in  defective  condition,  nor  is  it  unreasonably\r\n\ndangerous.\"  Bernier v. Raymark  Indus., Inc., 516 A.2d  534,\r                                                         \r\n\n538 (Me. 1986) (quoting  Restatement (Second) of Torts   402A\r                                                                  \r\n\ncmt. j  (1965)).   However, this language  explicitly applies\r\n\nonly  to  claims that  a  product  is unreasonably  dangerous\r\n\nbecause it lacks an  adequate warning.  Bernier, 516  A.2d at\r                                                           \r\n\n538.   That  was  not the  crux  of plaintiff's  claim  here.\r\n\nPlaintiff's  theory was  that  the potpourri  pot had  design\r\n\ndefects  --  heating  its  contents to  an  excessively  high\r\n\ntemperature and no  locking lid -- which made it unreasonably\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\ndangerous.

Gail Moulton,  plaintiff's mother,\r\n\npurchased  a Rival Model 3207  electric potpourri pot.  Water\r\n\nand dried flowers or scented liquid and wax are heated in the\r\n\npot  and  allowed  to evaporate  to  perfume  the  air.   The\r\n\npotpourri  pot  was a  modified  version of  a  Rival kitchen\r\n\nproduct, a one-quart slow cooker.  The cover of the potpourri\r\n\npot could not be  secured to the  pot and had  a hole in  its\r\n\ncenter,   approximately  one  and  three-quarters  inches  in\r\n\ndiameter,  to allow fragrance to escape.  The date Rival sold\r\n\nthis particular potpourri pot is not known.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\n          Literature accompanying the  pot contained  several\r\n\nwarnings,  including:  \"Close  supervision is  necessary when\r\n\nany appliance is  used by  or near children.\"   Mrs.  Moulton\r\n\nread the  instructions and warnings and  placed the potpourri\r\n\npot under  a table  in a  corner of  the  living room  hidden\r\n\nbehind pottery and baskets.   In February 1995, she  left her\r\n\none-year-old son Christopher in the living room while she got\r\n\nhim a drink from  the adjoining kitchen.   She heard a  noise\r\n\nand returned to the living room to find  the child sitting on\r\n\nthe floor in a pool of liquid.  The cover was off the pot, in\r\n\nthe puddle of liquid potpourri.  She did not notice where the\r\n\npot itself was.\r\n\n          No one knows exactly how the accident happened.  It\r\n\nis reasonable  to conclude either  that the pot  tipped over,\r\n\nspilling  the heated liquid, or that the child took the cover\r\n\noff.   In any event, the  lid came off  the pot, and  the hot\r\n\nliquid came into contact with the child's arm and hand.\r\n\n          Plaintiff's  left hand and arm were severely burned\r\n\nin the accident.  He spent over a month at the Shriners Burns\r\n\nHospital in  Boston undergoing extensive treatment.   He will\r\n\nneed extensive  medical treatment  in the  future.   His left\r\n\nhand  and arm are entirely covered by scar tissue, which does\r\n\nnot grow like normal skin.  As he grows,  the inflexible scar\r\n\ntissue must be released by surgical incisions to  prevent his\r\n\njoints from growing  abnormally; skin grafts are used to fill\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nin the gaps, and  a physical therapy regimen is  necessary to\r\n\nrestore  movement to the hand.  This cycle of growth, surgery\r\n\nand physical therapy will  continue until the plaintiff stops\r\n\ngrowing, at around age twenty.\r\n\n          The  type   of  potpourri   pot  involved  in   the\r\n\nplaintiff's accident  evolved from earlier products.   Rival,\r\n\nwhich manufactures various  household appliances, decided  to\r\n\nmarket an electric potpourri pot.  Before placing the item on\r\n\nthe  market, Rival  submitted the  item, which it  called the\r\n\nModel  3207,  for  evaluation  by  Underwriters  Laboratories\r\n\n(\"UL\"),  an  independent  not-for-profit  testing  laboratory\r\n\nwhich sets  and publishes  safety standards; these  standards\r\n\nare  often   adopted  by  the  American   National  Standards\r\n\nInstitute.\r\n\n          UL  replied that the pot did  not meet the relevant\r\n\nsafety standards.   UL sent Rival a letter in June 1987 which\r\n\nstated that the potpourri  pot heated liquids to temperatures\r\n\nexceeding the applicable standard,  and noted that, since the\r\n\nlid had no  means of being  secured and had  a one and  three\r\n\nquarters inch hole in its center, it could not be relied upon\r\n\nas  a barrier to prevent  scalding.  UL  therefore refused to\r\n\n\"list\" the  pot.1   However, by  the time  the UL  report was\r\n\nissued,  Rival  had already  set  production  to commence  in\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  A \"listed\"  product would bear a  sticker indicating that\r\nthe  laboratory  had  determined   that  the  product  met  a\r\nparticular safety standard.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nAugust 1987.   Despite UL's  rejection, Rival  decided to  go\r\n\nahead with its production plans anyway.\r\n\n          Rival submitted  the potpourri pot  to ETL  testing\r\n\nlaboratories,  a  commercial (for  profit)  laboratory.   ETL\r\n\nissued a  report certifying  that the  potpourri pot  met the\r\n\nvery  standard that UL had  reported the pot  failed to meet.\r\n\nThe ETL report should have raised concerns on its face.   The\r\n\nstated temperature  in  the report  to which  the pot  heated\r\n\nliquids  was too high to  meet the applicable  standard.  The\r\n\nproduct was nonetheless put on the market.\r\n\n          The  Model 3207  potpourri pot  was the  only Rival\r\n\nproduct not  listed by  UL.   This apparently  troubled Rival\r\n\nofficials.   They ordered various tests  to determine whether\r\n\nthe  item  could be  modified  to  meet the  evolving  safety\r\n\nstandards  adopted by  UL.   Rival's product  safety engineer\r\n\nreported that UL  had determined that  water hotter than  149\r\n\ndegrees  Farenheit could cause serious skin  burns on contact\r\n\nand  that  the  potpourri   pot  was  designed  to  reach   a\r\n\ntemperature of 174 degrees  Farenheit.  Rival was  also aware\r\n\nthat UL took  the position that this product,  unlike cooking\r\n\nappliances, was  likely to  be \"touched, bumped,  handled, or\r\n\neven upset  when used as intended.\"   Consequently, UL wanted\r\n\nlimitations  placed on  the temperature  and quantity  of the\r\n\nliquid and  wanted a tight-fitting lid.   Rival's competitors\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nproduced  potpourri  pots with  locking  lids.   However,  no\r\n\nmodifications were made to the Model 3207.\r\n\n          After the potpourri pot had  been on the market for\r\n\na  short  time,  Rival  began  to  receive  reports  of young\r\n\nchildren  who  were burned  by  accidental  contact with  the\r\n\nheated potpourri mixture.2   Rival still made no modification\r\n\nto the design.   After 1991, the company changed  the package\r\n\ninsert  to warn  consumers that the  contents of the pot were\r\n\nhot  and that  the pot  should be  kept out  of the  reach of\r\n\nchildren.3  Accidents continued to occur in the early 1990's.\r\n\nAt some point, although the parties cannot pinpoint the exact\r\n\ndate, a tag warning that the product could cause burns to the\r\n\nskin was  placed on  the cord  of the Model  3206, a  smaller\r\n\nversion of the Model 3207 that lacked any cover.\r\n\n                              II\r\n\n          Plaintiff  filed suit against  the Rival Company in\r\n\nNovember 1995  in  federal court  in  Maine.   The  complaint\r\n\nalleged  that   Rival  was   legally   responsible  for   the\r\n\nplaintiff's  injuries  because  (1)  the  potpourri  pot  was\r\n\ndefective  and  unreasonably dangerous  as  a  result of  its\r\n\ndesign; (2)  Rival was  negligent in designing  the potpourri\r\n\npot and/or in failing  to warn users of the  product's design\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Some of the accidents involved  the Model 3207 (the model\r\nin this case), while others involved a similar model.\r\n\n3.  The  previous  warning  had  stated  that  users   should\r\nsupervise closely when the pot was operated near children.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\ndefect;  and  (3)  the potpourri  pot  failed  to perform  in\r\n\naccordance  with the express warranty.  Rival defended on the\r\n\ngrounds  that   the  product  was  safe,   the  warnings  and\r\n\ninstructions  adequate, and  the blame  for the  accident lay\r\n\nwith the child's  mother for  placing the pot  where her  son\r\n\ncould reach it and then leaving him unattended.\r\n\n          After  a   one-week  trial,   the  jury   found  in\r\n\nplaintiff's  favor  on the  strict  liability  and negligence\r\n\nclaims and awarded him $2.2 million in compensatory damages.\r\n\n                             III\r\n\nPost-Sale Duty to Warn\r                                  \r\n\n          The primary  issue raised  by Rival is  whether the\r\n\ndistrict  court erred  in instructing  the jury  on negligent\r\n\npost-sale duty to warn.  The trial judge charged: \r\n\n          When a  manufacturer learns . .  . of the\r\n          dangers  associated  with the  reasonably\r\n          foreseeable use of its product after they\r\n          are  distributed,  the manufacturer  must\r\n          take reasonable steps to  warn reasonably\r\n          foreseeable  users  about  those  dangers\r\n          . . . .\r\n\nRival  argues that the Maine Law Court has never imposed such\r\n\na post-sale duty on manufacturers  and would not do so.   The\r\n\nplaintiff  responds   that  the  majority   of  jurisdictions\r\n\nrecognize a negligence-based post-sale duty to warn and that,\r\n\nif faced with the issue, Maine would do the same.\r\n\n          We  do not reach the issue of whether the Maine Law\r\n\nCourt  would recognize  a negligence-based post-sale  duty to\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nwarn because the  jury verdict is  adequately supported on  a\r\n\nstrict liability  claim    and  the  damages  are  the  same.\r\n\nFurther, no  issues concerning the  admissibility of evidence\r\n\nturn on this.\r\n\n          The trial  court separated  the theories of  strict\r\n\nliability,  negligence   and  warranty   both  in   the  jury\r\n\ninstructions  and  in the  special  verdict form.    The jury\r\n\nstated  on  the  special  verdict  form  that  it  found  the\r\n\ndefendant liable on a strict liability theory as well as on a\r\n\nnegligence  theory.    Even  if  the  instructions  involving\r\n\nnegligent post-sale duty  to warn were incorrect as  a matter\r\n\nof  Maine  law,  the  finding  of  liability  on  the  strict\r\n\nliability theory would be sufficient to support the judgment.\r\n\n          Rival  maintains  the  issue  must  nevertheless be\r\n\nreached.   It argues that  certain evidence  was admitted  at\r\n\ntrial in  support of  the plaintiff's  theory that there  had\r\n\nbeen a negligent failure  to warn and that this  evidence was\r\n\nboth  prejudicial and  irrelevant to  any of the  other legal\r\n\ntheories  advanced by  plaintiff.   The evidence  in question\r\n\nconcerns  what  the  defendant terms  a  subsequent  remedial\r\n\nmeasure: the  placement of  a warning  tag on  the electrical\r\n\ncord of the Model 3206 (which  is smaller than the Model 3207\r\n\nand  does not have a cover).4   The defendant argues that if,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  This modification  is not  a subsequent  remedial measure\r\nfor  purposes of Rule 407  of the Federal  Rules of Evidence.\r\nThat rule  does not  apply where,  as here, the  modification\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nas it claims, Maine would not recognize a negligent post-sale\r\n\nduty  to  warn, this  evidence  was  improperly admitted  and\r\n\nsufficiently  prejudicial  to  warrant   a  new  trial.    We\r\n\ndisagree.\r\n\n          First, the  trial court ruled that  the warning tag\r\n\nevidence  was relevant to the issue of whether there had been\r\n\na negligent violation  of a pre-sale duty to  warn as well as\r\n\nof a post-sale duty  to warn.  Although  the sequence of  the\r\n\nplacement of the warning  tags and the sale of  the appliance\r\n\nis unknown,  the defendant never  challenged this evidentiary\r\n\nruling as to the pre-sale duty to warn.  The point is waived.\r\n\n          Furthermore,  even assuming  arguendo  that it  was\r\n\nerror  to admit  the \"cord tag\"  evidence, \"the  standard for\r\n\nreviewing  a district  court's nonconstitutional  error in  a\r\n\ncivil suit requires that we find such error harmless if it is\r\n\nhighly  probable that the error did not affect the outcome of\r\n\nthe case.\"  Harrison v.

Under  these\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\ncircumstances, we cannot say the trial  court abused its wide\r\n\ndiscretion in admitting this evidence.\r\n\nSufficiency of the Evidence\r                                       \r\n\n          Finally,   the  defendant  argues  that  the  trial\r\n\ncourt's  denials of its Rule  50(b) motion for  judgment as a\r\n\nmatter of  law and of  its motion for  a new trial  should be\r\n\nreversed.   It claims  that the  evidence, together with  all\r\n\nreasonable   inferences   in   the   plaintiff's   favor,  is\r\n\ninsufficient to support the verdict.  Review is de novo.

The defendant points to the Maine\r\n\nLaw  Court's  statement  that \"a  product  bearing  .  . .  a\r\n\nwarning,  which is safe for use if [the warning] is followed,\r\n\nis  not  in  defective  condition,  nor  is  it  unreasonably\r\n\ndangerous.\"  Bernier v.

That  was  not the  crux  of plaintiff's  claim  here.\r\n\nPlaintiff's  theory was  that  the potpourri  pot had  design\r\n\ndefects  --  heating  its  contents to  an  excessively  high\r\n\ntemperature and no  locking lid -- which made it unreasonably\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\ndangerous.
