James L.

Rodrguez-Vidal, with whom Carlos Lugo-Fiol,\r\nSolicitor General, Edda Serrano Blasini, Deputy Solicitor General,\r\nVanessa Ramirez, Assistant Solicitor General, and the Department of\r\nJustice, Puerto Rico, were on brief, for the Colegio de Abogados de\r\nPuerto Rico and the Secretaries of Justice and Treasury of the\r\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico.\r\n   Salvador Antonetti-Zequeira for the Justices of the Supreme\r\nCourt of Puerto Rico.\r\n\nJuly 15, 1999\r\n\nPer Curiam.  After two decades of litigation in the\r\nPuerto Rico and federal courts, plaintiffs Robert E. Schneider,\r\nJr., and Hctor Ramos-Daz succeeded in invalidating the use of bar\r\ndues for ideological purposes by the mandatory bar of Puerto Rico,\r\nthe Colegio de Abogados.  The action in the case at hand was a\r\ncivil rights action; the successful claims were of constitutional\r\ndimension.  Other claims were less successful.  The district court,\r\nacting pursuant to 42 U.S.C.  1988, awarded plaintiffs $244,848.12\r\nin attorney's fees plus costs and a refund in unrefunded compulsory\r\ndues.  The Colegio and other defendants (collectively, \"the\r\nColegio\") appeal.  Schneider and Ramos cross appeal, saying, inter\r\nalia, that they were entitled to even more.  We affirm in part and\r\nreverse in part.\r\nThe long history of this hard-fought litigation will not\r\nbe repeated here.  It is adequately told in the following opinions: \r\nSchneider v. Colegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico, 546 F. Supp. 1251\r\n(D.P.R. 1982); In re The Justices of Supreme Court of Puerto Rico,\r\n695 F.2d 17 (1st Cir. 1982); Schneider v. Colegio de Abogados de\r\nPuerto Rico, 565 F. Supp. 963 (D.P.R. 1983), vacated by Romany v.\r\nColegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico, 742 F.2d 32 (1st Cir. 1984);\r\nSchneider v. Colegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico, 572 F. Supp. 957,\r\n957-58 (D.P.R. 1983); Schneider v. Colegio de Abogados de Puerto\r\nRico, 670 F. Supp. 1098 (D.P.R. 1987); Schneider v. Colegio de\r\nAbogados de Puerto Rico, 682 F. Supp. 674 (D.P.R. 1988), rev'd in\r\npart by Schneider v. Colegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico, 917 F.2d\r\n620 (1st Cir. 1990); Schneider v. Colegio de Abogados de Puerto\r\nRico, 947 F. Supp. 34 (D.P.R. 1996); and Schneider v. Colegio de\r\nAbogados de Puerto Rico, No. 82-1459 (D.P.R. Aug. 7, 1997).\r\nThe Colegio protests that there should have been no award\r\nat all for two reasons.  First, Schneider was representing himself\r\nas well as Ramos and this, the Colegio says, makes Schneider a pro\r\nse attorney-plaintiff who may not receive fees under the rule of\r\nKay v. Ehrler, 499 U.S. 432, 437-38 (1991).  In addition, the\r\nColegio argues, plaintiffs are not prevailing parties.  In any\r\nevent, the Colegio says, the fee award is simply too high for a\r\nnumber of reasons.\r\nQuestions of law regarding the award of attorney's fees\r\nare reviewed de novo.  See Williams v. Hanover Housing Auth., 113\r\nF.3d 1294, 1297 (1st Cir. 1997).  Otherwise, the award is reviewed\r\nwith deference and \"will be disturbed only for mistake of law or\r\nabuse of discretion.\"  Rodriguez-Hernandez v. Miranda-Velez, 132\r\nF.3d 848, 858 (1st Cir. 1998).\r\nWe affirm the award of attorney's fees plus costs and the\r\nrefund of unrefunded dues, except for those fees and costs\r\nassociated with the proceedings in the courts of the Commonwealth\r\nof Puerto Rico that took place before the filing of this federal\r\nlawsuit.  As to that limited amount of fees and costs, totaling\r\n$13,872.20, the court reverses and vacates.\r\nThe first question is whether any fees should be awarded\r\nin light of the fact that attorney Schneider was a plaintiff as\r\nwell as counsel.  Here, Ramos is a plaintiff and Schneider also\r\nrepresented Ramos; the fees incurred by plaintiffs are essentially\r\nthe same whether or not Schneider was also a plaintiff.  The\r\nColegio does not argue otherwise.  Thus, in our view, the\r\nprohibition in Kay against awarding attorney's fees to an attorney\r\npro se litigant does not apply.  See Kay, 499 U.S. at 437-38.  We\r\ndo not reach the issue of whether plaintiffs would have had\r\ndifficulty in obtaining other counsel, a matter on which the record\r\nis barren of evidence.\r\nThe second question is whether plaintiffs are prevailing\r\nparties given the partial success of their claims.  On balance, we\r\nconclude that they are prevailing parties given their success in\r\ninvalidating the payment of mandatory bar dues for ideological\r\nactivities of the bar.  See Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 109\r\n(1992) (explaining that \"plaintiffs may be considered 'prevailing\r\nparties' for attorney's fees purposes if they succeed on any\r\nsignificant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit\r\nthe parties sought in bringing suit\") (quoting Hensley v.\r\nEckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433 (1983) (internal quotation marks\r\nomitted)).\r\nThe third question is whether attorney's fees may be\r\nawarded to plaintiffs for work done in the Commonwealth courts\r\nbefore the filing of the federal lawsuit.  The district court's\r\nattempts to find this situation identical to abstention by a\r\nfederal court after a federal claim has been filed and to further\r\ncharacterize the Puerto Rico proceedings \"as a necessary prelude to\r\nthe federal action\" are in error, both as a matter of law and of\r\nfact.  Schneider v. Colegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico, No. 82-\r\n1459, slip op. at 4-5, (D.P.R. Aug. 7, 1997) (emphasis added).  The\r\ncorrect test is articulated in Webb v. Board of Education, 471 U.S.\r\n234 (1985): pre-suit fees may be awarded under 42 U.S.C.  1988\r\nonly for \"discrete\" work \"that was both useful and of a type\r\nordinarily necessary to advance the civil rights litigation to the\r\nstage it reached.\"  Id. at 243.  After all, the statutory language\r\nin  1988 permits an award of attorney's fees only \"[i]n any action\r\nor proceeding to enforce a provision of section[] . . . 1983.\"  42\r\nU.S.C.  1988(b) (emphasis added).  No federal claims were raised\r\nin the Puerto Rico proceeding and plaintiffs do not meet the Webb\r\ntest.\r\nThe next question is whether the overall fee award is\r\nexcessive.  The district court found that the claims on which the\r\nplaintiffs prevailed were \"reasonably related\" to those on which\r\nthe plaintiffs lost, and the court therefore declined to reduce the\r\noverall award on the basis of plaintiffs' limited success. \r\nAlthough the question is close, we think that the district court\r\nproperly found an adequate relationship between the successful and\r\nunsuccessful claims.  See Hensley, 461 U.S. at 440 (noting that an\r\naward of attorneys' fees based on related claims should not be\r\nreduced merely because the plaintiff did not prevail on every\r\nclaim).  As to the remainder of the defendants' objections and as\r\nto plaintiffs' cross appeal, there is no showing of mistake of law,\r\nclear error of fact, or abuse of discretion by the district court.\r\nFor these reasons, the judgment is affirmed in part,\r\nreversed in part, and the judgment is modified to reduce the\r\nattorney's fees awarded from $244,848.12 to $230,975.92 (with\r\ninterest from September 22, 1988, as per the district court's final\r\njudgment).\r\nCosts to plaintiffs.\r\n\nLIPEZ, Circuit Judge, concurring.  Although I agree with\r\nthe results arrived at by my colleagues in their per curiam\r\nopinion, I wish to explain more fully the history of this case and\r\nmy rationale for the conclusions we reach. This case is the\r\nculmination of a two decade long odyssey of litigation that has\r\nengaged thousands of hours of attorney and court time, raised\r\nimportant constitutional issues, and engendered strong feelings\r\namong the parties. Under these circumstances, I think it is\r\nappropriate to offer an explanation that hopefully will enhance an\r\nunderstanding of the issues we have addressed and avoid further\r\nlitigation.\r\n                             I.\r\n                     Litigation History\r\nThe Colegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico (\"Colegio\"),\r\nPuerto Rico's unitary bar association, instituted disciplinary\r\nproceedings in the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico in 1977 against\r\nninety-nine attorneys for failure to pay their annual dues. All but\r\ntwo, Robert E. Schneider, Jr. and Hctor R. Ramos-Daz, paid the\r\ndues. As a defense to the disciplinary proceedings, Schneider and\r\nRamos argued that the statute establishing the Colegio in its\r\nmodern form, Law Number 43, 4 L.P.R.A.  771, as amended, exceeded\r\nthe authority of the Puerto Rico legislature, and that compelled\r\nmembership in the Colegio violated their rights of free speech and\r\nassociation under the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto\r\nRico. Schneider and Ramos alleged that bar dues were being used\r\nto fund ideological activities outside the legitimate scope of a\r\nbar association. A special master was appointed by the Court to\r\nreceive evidence, and after several years of proceedings (during\r\nwhich Schneider served as counsel for himself and Ramos), the\r\nSupreme Court of Puerto Rico issued an opinion on April 5, 1982.\r\nColegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico v. Schneider, 112 D.P.R. 540, 12\r\nT.P.R. 676 (P.R. 1982) (Colegio I).\r\nThe Court ruled that Law 43 was a valid exercise of\r\nlegislative power and that compulsory membership in the Colegio was\r\nconstitutional under the Puerto Rico Constitution. Holding that it\r\nhad plenary power to shape rules governing Colegio membership, the\r\nCourt ordered the Colegio to institute a new process permitting\r\nattorneys to dissent from the use of their dues for ideological\r\nactivities, including the establishment by the next dues period of\r\nan independent review board to pass on controversies arising over\r\nactivities funded from dues. Dissenters' dues would be held in\r\nescrow until then. See 12 T.P.R. at 695. In passing on the\r\nconstitutionality of the Colegio's use of compulsory dues for\r\nideological purposes, and in shaping the remedy, the Court based\r\nits rulings on dissenters' rights arising under the Puerto Rico\r\nConstitution, not the federal Constitution. However, it stated that\r\n\"the sense of the freedom of speech clause contained in Art. II,\r\nSec. 4 of the Constitution of Puerto Rico is not narrower than that\r\ngiven by the United States Supreme Court to the First Amendment in\r\nthis context,\" id. at 692, and relied heavily on federal precedent\r\nin its discussion, see id. at 689-94. The Court gave Schneider and\r\nRamos fifteen days to pay their dues or be suspended from the\r\npractice of law. Id. at 695. Notwithstanding the promised procedure\r\nfor objecting to Colegio activities, Schneider and Ramos refused to\r\npay dues, and were disbarred on June 3, 1982.\r\nOn June 9, 1982, Schneider filed a complaint on behalf of\r\nRamos and himself in federal district court alleging that the\r\nColegio, its Foundation, the Secretaries of Justice and Treasury of\r\nPuerto Rico, and the Justices of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico\r\nviolated their civil rights pursuant to 42 U.S.C.  1983.\r\nResponding to assorted motions filed by the parties, the district\r\ncourt ruled on September 13, 1982, inter alia, that plaintiffs'\r\nchallenge to compulsory Colegio membership and to the use of dues\r\nand stamp revenues for ideological purposes stated a cause of\r\naction not barred by res judicata or collateral estoppel\r\nprinciples, that abstention was not appropriate, and that the\r\nJustices of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico were immune from\r\ndamages but not from declaratory and injunctive relief. See\r\nSchneider v. Colegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico, 546 F. Supp. 1251\r\n(D.P.R. 1982) (Torruella, J.) (Schneider I).\r\nDuring the pendency of the proceedings in the district\r\ncourt, the Colegio, its Foundation, and the Justices of the Supreme\r\nCourt of Puerto Rico submitted petitions for a writ of mandamus to\r\nthis court, asking that we order the district court to expedite its\r\ndecision or dismiss the action. Two days after the district court\r\nissued its opinion, we entertained oral argument on the petitions\r\nfor mandamus (now reduced to seeking dismissal), and we modified\r\nthe court's decision sub nom. In re The Justices of the Supreme\r\nCourt of Puerto Rico, 695 F.2d 17 (1st Cir. 1982) (Schneider II).\r\nWe held that the Justices were entitled to a writ of mandamus\r\nrequiring the district court to dismiss claims against the Justices\r\nconcerning compulsory bar membership or compulsory payment of bar\r\ndues because the Justices had only a neutral, adjudicatory role\r\nwith respect to those claims. See id. at 25. We further held that\r\nthe Justices should remain \"purely nominal parties\" with respect to\r\nchallenges to the use of stamp revenues because of their\r\nadministrative responsibilities over the stamp program. Id. at 27.\r\nThe request of the Colegio and its Foundation for mandamus relief\r\nwas denied. See id.\r\nIn December 1982, in compliance with the earlier order of\r\nthe Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, the Colegio adopted a remedial\r\nrefund procedure and informed that Court of its action. While the\r\nSupreme Court of Puerto Rico evaluated the remedy, the district\r\ncourt held an evidentiary hearing on the merits of the proposal,\r\nfollowed by full argument and briefing. In June 1983, the district\r\ncourt issued a ruling characterizing the Colegio's remedy as a\r\n\"sham, designed to forestall the adjudication of this case and the\r\nremedies to which Plaintiffs are entitled under the Laws and\r\nConstitution of the United States.\" Schneider v. Colegio de\r\nAbogados de Puerto Rico, 565 F. Supp. 963, 977 (D.P.R. 1983)\r\n(Schneider III). As noted by the district court, the proposal\r\nprovided that, in order to retain a right to object to any activity\r\nfunded by the Colegio, a general objection to funding ideological\r\nactivities had to be voiced by a dissenting member at the moment of\r\npaying dues. Members were then required to object specifically to\r\nindividual activities within thirty days after they took place, and\r\na Review Board of lawyers essentially selected by the Colegio's\r\nBoard of Governors would review objections on a standard that\r\ndefined \"ideological activities\" narrowly to mean activities\r\n\"related to partisan politics.\" Id. at 975. If an objection was\r\nsuccessful, the member who objected would receive a proportionate\r\nrefund of dues; others who objected only generally to the use of\r\ntheir fees for ideological activities would receive notice of the\r\noutcome and would have to file claims individually within thirty\r\ndays of notice in order to receive similar refunds. See id.\r\nThe court found the proposed remedy inadequate because it\r\n(1) failed entirely to address the issue of use of funds raised\r\nthrough sale of notarial stamps, (2) unconstitutionally required\r\ndissenters to disclose their disapproval of specific activities,\r\n(3) was procedurally inadequate to protect the dissenters,\r\nrequiring excessive vigilance from them, and (4) used too narrow a\r\ndefinition of \"ideological.\" Id. at 976-77. The court therefore\r\ndeclared various sections of Law 43 and related acts \"as\r\ninterpreted, enforced and applied\" to be unconstitutional. Id. at\r\n979-80. The court also enjoined all defendants (except the\r\nJustices) from taking any action against lawyers who failed to pay\r\ndues or fees to the Colegio \"until such time as the Colegio ceases\r\nto engage in ideological and/or political activism,\" from\r\ncollecting fees from the sale of forensic or notarial stamps, or\r\nfrom preventing anyone otherwise qualified from engaging in legal\r\nor notarial practice for failure to pay dues or fees or failure to\r\nbe a member of the Colegio. Id. Plaintiffs Oreste Ramos, Romany and\r\nSouss (to whom the court limited, without explanation, its award)\r\nwere awarded nominal damages of one dollar each. See id. at 980.\r\nThe court subsequently refused to stay this judgment pending\r\nappeal. See Schneider v. Colegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico, 572 F.\r\nSupp. 957, 962 (D.P.R. 1983) (Schneider IV).\r\nWe vacated this decision sub nom. Romany v. Colegio de\r\nAbogados de Puerto Rico, 742 F.2d 32, 40-43 (1st Cir. 1984)\r\n(Schneider V), reasoning that the court should have abstained from\r\ndeciding the federal constitutional claims, and citing to cases in\r\nthe line descended from Railroad Commission of Texas v. Pullman,\r\n312 U.S. 496 (1941). We stated that \"the district court should have\r\nstayed its hand in this case, pending final determination of the\r\nissues turning upon Puerto Rico law, as it is clear that completion\r\nof the remedial stage of [Colegio I] 'might avoid in whole or in\r\npart the necessity for federal constitutional adjudication; or at\r\nleast materially alter the nature of the problem.'\" 742 F.2d at 40\r\n(quoting Harrison v. NAACP, 360 U.S. 167, 177 (1959)). We added\r\nthat \"[t]he argument for abstention is also greatly strengthened by\r\nseveral special factors\" present in the case. Id. at 42. First, an\r\naction in the Commonwealth court was already pending. See id.\r\nSecond, because the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico had inherent\r\nplenary power to shape the rules governing the bar, it could\r\ndirectly fashion relief, whereas a federal court was limited to\r\nstriking down provisions. See id. at 42-43. Finally, we cited\r\ncomity considerations: \"the expertise, cooperation and goodwill of\r\nthe Supreme Court of Puerto Rico will make much difference to the\r\nsuccess of any remedy from whatever source over the long run. This\r\nfact alone suggests the need for restraint in these\r\ncircumstances. . . . [W]hile we can appreciate the concerns of the\r\ndistrict court, we think this matter must be approached with\r\ndeliberation and full respect for the role of the judiciary of the\r\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico.\" Id. at 43. The stamp issues were also\r\nheld suitable for abstention, despite the fact that they were not\r\naddressed in Colegio I. See id. at 43-44. Finally, we recommended\r\nthat the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico implement an interim remedy\r\nto protect the interests of the dissenters: pending the resolution\r\nof both Commonwealth and federal proceedings, we suggested that 50%\r\nof dissenting members' dues should be held in an escrow account\r\nmanaged by a neutral entity. See id. at 44-45.\r\nIn the wake of our abstention ruling, the Supreme Court\r\nof Puerto Rico again held hearings to consider a remedy. In late\r\n1984, the Court issued an order providing for the interim remedy we\r\nsuggested, and then reinstated Schneider and Ramos to the practice\r\nof law in light of their consent to that remedy. After hearings,\r\nthe Court issued an opinion outlining a permanent remedy. See\r\nColegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico v. Schneider, 117 D.P.R. 504, 17\r\nT.P.R. 610 (P.R. 1986) (Colegio II). The opinion established a list\r\nof non-objectionable activities (such as maintaining professional\r\nand ethical standards, advocating the rights and immunities of\r\nlawyers, establishing legal aid programs, and so forth), without\r\noffering a definition of \"objectionable\" activities. 17 T.P.R. at\r\n630-31. It then provided that dissenting attorneys could lodge a\r\ngeneral objection to funding all \"objectionable\" activities, either\r\nat the time of paying annual dues or later during the year. Id. at\r\n633. A portion of dissenters' dues (15% for those objecting upon\r\npayment; proportionately less for mid-year dissenters) would be\r\nreserved in a general escrow account. See id. at 634. Any member of\r\nthe Colegio could raise objections to specific activities before a\r\nreview panel of retired Commonwealth judges, reviewable by the\r\nSupreme Court of Puerto Rico. If the review panel found the\r\nactivity to be objectionable, a proportionate dues refund would be\r\npaid to the objector and to all those who lodged a general\r\nobjection. See id. at 632-35. The costs and expenses of the use of\r\nColegio facilities by third parties engaged in objectionable\r\nactivities would be \"subject to this remedy\" if those parties did\r\nnot cover those costs and expenses. Id. at 631. Proceeds from the\r\nsale of notarial and bar stamps were not to be used for\r\nobjectionable activities. See id. at 636.\r\nThe Colegio then moved to dismiss the federal action as\r\nres judicata. The district court (per Torruella, by then a Circuit\r\nJudge, sitting by designation) rejected this argument, see\r\nSchneider v. Colegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico, 670 F. Supp. 1098,\r\n1101 (D.P.R. 1987) (Schneider VI), for roughly the same reasons it\r\ngave earlier, in Schneider I, 546 F. Supp. at 1268-74 (a ruling not\r\nappealed and thus, the court held, the law of the case). 28 U.S.C.\r\n1738 requires federal courts to give the same preclusive effect\r\nto judicial proceedings of any state, territory or possession\r\n(including the \"Commonwealth\" of Puerto Rico; see Felix Davis v.\r\nVieques Air Link, 892 F.2d 1122, 1124 (1st Cir. 1990)) that those\r\njudgments would be given in the courts of the state, territory or\r\npossession from where the judgments were entered. See Kremer v.\r\nChemical Constr. Corp., 456 U.S. 461, 466 (1982). Puerto Rico's res\r\njudicata rules require that \"there be the most perfect identity\r\nbetween the things, causes, and persons of the litigants, and their\r\ncapacity as such.\" 31 L.P.R.A.  3343 (quoted in Schneider VI, 670\r\nF. Supp. at 1104). The court found that the federal case concerned\r\nongoing obligations to support the Colegio, whereas the\r\nCommonwealth case concerned only past obligations not met, thus\r\ndisrupting the required identity. Collateral estoppel was\r\ninapplicable because the federal claims were not raised in the\r\nCommonwealth proceedings. Schneider VI, 670 F. Supp. at 1104.\r\nReaching the merits once again in a subsequent hearing,\r\nthe district court found that the 1986 rule failed to adequately\r\nprotect dissenters' rights. See Schneider v. Colegio de Abogados de\r\nPuerto Rico, 682 F. Supp. 674 (D.P.R. 1988) (Schneider VII). The\r\ncourt found the rule's definition of \"objectionable\" activities \r\ntoo narrow. The rule stated that activities within \"the Bar\r\nAssociation's purposes and ends which are germane thereto shall not\r\nbe considered objectionable,\" and then stated that the Colegio's\r\n\"functions and purposes\" are \"[t]o exercise . . . powers conferred\r\nby law or by the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico and any other\r\nincidental powers necessary or convenient for the ends of its\r\ncreation and which are not in disagreement with the purpose and the\r\nlaw which creates the Bar Association.\" Id. at 687.\r\nMost importantly, the parties had stipulated for this\r\nproceeding that objectionable Colegio activities, similar to those\r\nundertaken prior to 1983, had continued. See id. at 678. This\r\nstipulation induced the court to implement substantial remedial\r\nmeasures. The court found the 15% escrow reserve percentage to be\r\narbitrary, and held that the Colegio had to base the escrow\r\npercentage on each year's projected budget, including a buffer\r\nallowing for error in the budget projections. See id. at 687-88.\r\nThe court also found unacceptable the requirement that dissenters\r\nobject to specific activities, and the fact that those objections\r\nwould be made public. See id. at 684, 689. The court allowed 60\r\ndays for the Commonwealth to institute a remedial rule. See id. at\r\n691. Pending the adoption of such a rule, the defendants could not\r\ncompel payment of dues or fees, use of stamps, or membership in\r\nthe Colegio. See id. Finally, the court awarded nominal damages of\r\none dollar to each of the five plaintiffs. See id. at 692.\r\nOn appeal from the district court's ruling, we stayed the\r\ninjunction prohibiting mandatory dues for six months \"so that the\r\nColegio may remain integrated while it attempts to correct its\r\nconstitutional defects.\"  See Schneider v. Colegio de Abogados de\r\nPuerto Rico, 917 F.2d 620, 623, 636 (1st Cir. 1990) (Schneider\r\nVIII). During this period, 100% of dissenters' dues would be held\r\nin escrow. See id. at 636. After the six months had passed, the\r\ninjunction was again stayed (this time by the district court)\r\npending consideration of petitions for certiorari filed by the\r\nColegio, Secretaries, and plaintiffs, all of which were denied by\r\nthe Supreme Court on January 13, 1992. See 502 U.S. 1029 (1992).\r\nThe Supreme Court of Puerto Rico issued a new rule in\r\nJune of 1992. The district court reviewed it, and, finding it\r\ninadequate in several respects, ordered the parties to submit the\r\ndistrict court's amendments to the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico for\r\nits consideration. Order, No. 82-1459 (D.P.R. Nov. 19, 1992).\r\nAmended rules were issued by the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico in\r\nJanuary 1993. Judge Torruella withdrew from the case on March 13,\r\n1995. Following the recusal of all other judges in the District of\r\nPuerto Rico, Judge James L. Watson was designated to sit in the\r\nDistrict of Puerto Rico and assigned the case. He approved the new\r\nrule and held that the dissenting attorneys were entitled to\r\nattorney's fees as prevailing parties under 42 U.S.C.  1988. See\r\nSchneider v. Colegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico, 947 F. Supp. 34,\r\n41, 42 (D.P.R. 1996) (Schneider IX). After holding hearings and\r\nreceiving evidence, the court awarded attorney's fees in the amount\r\nof $244,848.12 plus interest to Schneider for his representation of\r\nRamos and himself throughout the litigation, from 1977 onwards,\r\nincluding time spent in the disciplinary proceedings and post-\r\nabstention proceedings in the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico. See\r\nMemorandum, Opinion and Order, No. 82-1459 (D.P.R. August 7, 1997)\r\n(Schneider X, unpublished slip opinion). After issuance of a final\r\nJudgment, No. 82-1459 (D.P.R. March 23, 1998) (Schneider XI,\r\nunpublished), the parties resubmitted notices of appeal.\r\nOn appeal, the Colegio and the Secretaries challenge the\r\ncourt's award of attorney's fees, claiming that Schneider was pro\r\nse and therefore not entitled to fees under  1988, that he and\r\nRamos were not prevailing parties, and that the award of fees was\r\nexcessive, primarily because it compensated for hours spent in\r\nproceedings before the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico. They also\r\nclaim the court erred in its order mandating a refund of dues to\r\nplaintiffs. In their cross-appeal, Schneider and Ramos claim the\r\ncourt erred in failing to: (1) order a more extensive refund of\r\ndues; (2) address a seeming inconsistency in the rules governing\r\nwho may object to specific Colegio activities; (3) adequately\r\nsanction the Colegio for its failure to notice plaintiffs of\r\nmotions before the court and for its withdrawal of funds from the\r\nescrow account; (4) award fees to attorney Hctor Mrquez for his\r\nrepresentation of several other plaintiffs in this litigation; and\r\n(5) hold the Justices of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico liable\r\nfor attorney's fees.\r\n\n                            II.\r\n                         The Appeal\r\nA. Plaintiffs' entitlement to attorney's fees\r\nFederal courts have consistently held that a pro se\r\nlitigant who is not a lawyer is not entitled to attorney's fees\r\nunder  1988. See Lovell v. Snow, 637 F.2d 170 (1st Cir. 1981); see\r\nalso Poythress v. Kessler, 475 U.S. 1129, 1129 (1986) (Burger,\r\nC.J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (citing lower court\r\ncases); Gonzalez v. Kangas, 814 F.2d 1411, 1411 (9th Cir. 1987)\r\n(citing cases).  In Kay v. Ehrler, 499 U.S. 432 (1991), the Supreme\r\nCourt extended this rule to pro se litigants who also happen to be\r\nlawyers. The Court stated that \"it seems likely that Congress\r\ncontemplated an attorney-client relationship as the predicate for\r\nan award under  1988,\" id. at 436, and reasoned that Congress\r\nwished to encourage such an agency relationship so that parties\r\nwould benefit from the detached objectivity of a disinterested\r\nadvocate. See id. at 435-37.\r\nThis case is not Kay because Schneider was involved in an\r\nattorney-client relationship throughout this litigation,\r\nrepresenting both himself and Hctor R. Ramos-Daz. The attorney-\r\nclient relationship imposed an ethical obligation on Schneider to\r\nconsider the interests of his client at all times and exercise his\r\nbest professional judgment, thus satisfying the concerns\r\nunderlying Kay's requirement of an attorney-client relationship.\r\nNevertheless, the Colegio argues that we should extend Kay to\r\nsituations where an attorney-client relationship exists, but the\r\nattorney also has a personal interest in the outcome of the case.\r\nOn this theory, the Colegio asserts that Ramos (and Schneider as\r\nwell) should have sought counsel who was fully disinterested in the\r\noutcome of the case if they wished to avail themselves of\r\nattorney's fees under  1988.\r\nI disagree. If Ramos had retained an attorney admitted in\r\nPuerto Rico   that is, a member of the Colegio   to represent him,\r\nit could hardly be said that he had retained objective counsel. Any\r\nrelief achieved by the litigation would have affected the rights\r\nand obligations of such an attorney in relation to the Colegio,\r\njust as it would those of his client Ramos; therefore, such an\r\nattorney's stake in the outcome of the matter would resemble that\r\nof a party. Moreover, such an attorney would have complied with the\r\nvery rules that Ramos wished to challenge, and would thereby have\r\ntaken a position directly contrary to that of his client.\r\nAlthough Ramos could have sought counsel admitted only\r\noutside the jurisdiction, he would have faced many practical\r\ndifficulties. During most of the pendency of this case, an attorney\r\nwho was not a member of the Colegio could only practice in the\r\nCommonwealth through courtesy of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court.\r\nPrior to July 1, 1989, an attorney could not be admitted to\r\npractice before the federal district court for the District of\r\nPuerto Rico without being \"currently in good standing as an\r\nattorney admitted to practice before the courts of the Commonwealth\r\nof Puerto Rico.\" P.R. U.S. Dist. L.R. 201 (1987). Therefore, any\r\nattorney from outside the jurisdiction would have had to obtain\r\ncourtesy admission in the Commonwealth Court in order to argue even\r\nthe federal case (at least prior to July 1, 1989). In addition,\r\nRamos would have had to find an attorney from outside of Puerto\r\nRico proficient in Spanish and competent to deal with issues of\r\nCommonwealth constitutional law to function effectively in the\r\nCommonwealth Court proceedings.\r\nI believe the challenge of finding \"independent\" counsel\r\nwith fully objective judgment capable of competently handling the\r\nentirety of the case, and gaining his or her admission to practice\r\nbefore the Commonwealth and federal courts, would constitute an\r\nunreasonable burden on Ramos in the pursuit of his legal claims. If\r\n\"Congress was interested in ensuring the effective prosecution of\r\nmeritorious claims\" when it enacted  1988, as the Supreme Court\r\nstated in Kay, 499 U.S. at 437, surely it did not envision\r\nrequiring plaintiffs in the position of Ramos to seek disinterested\r\ncounsel under circumstances that would make such a requirement\r\nantithetical to the effective prosecution of their claim. I\r\ntherefore conclude that Schneider's party status, on the unusual\r\nfacts of this case, does not preclude an award of attorney's fees.\r\n\nB. Schneider's and Ramos' status as prevailing parties under 42\r\nU.S.C.  1988\r\nThe Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 90\r\nStat. 2641, as amended, 42 U.S.C.  1988(b), provides that:\r\n  In any action or proceeding to enforce a\r\nprovision of section[] . . . 1983 . . . of\r\nthis title, . . . the court, in its\r\ndiscretion, may allow the prevailing party,\r\nother than the United States, a reasonable\r\nattorney's fee as part of the costs . . . .\r\nThe Colegio and Secretaries argue that the relief obtained by\r\nplaintiffs consisted mainly of an award of nominal damages, which\r\n\"did not materially alter the relationship between the plaintiffs\r\nand the Colegio and the Secretaries,\" and left the outcome of the\r\nlitigation as a whole \"at most a minimal success\" for plaintiffs.\r\nThe Colegio and Secretaries contend that the primary \"relief sought\r\nin this case was clearly to convert the Colegio into a voluntary\r\nassociation, and shield the plaintiffs from the risk of disbarment\r\nfor their continued refusal to pay dues to the Colegio.\" This\r\nargument conflates an argument for a reduction in the size of the\r\naward due to \"limited success\" (which I consider in section C(1),\r\nbelow) with an argument that the plaintiffs here are not entitled\r\nto any fees award since they do not qualify as \"prevailing\r\nparties.\"\r\nPlaintiffs may be considered prevailing parties \"if they\r\nsucceed on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some\r\nof the benefit the parties sought in bringing suit.\" Texas State\r\nTeachers Assoc. v. Garland Indep. Sch. Dist., 489 U.S. 782, 789\r\n(1989) (quoting Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433 (1983)\r\n(quoting Nadeau v. Helgemoe, 581 F.2d 275, 278-79 (1st Cir.\r\n1978))). The Supreme Court has stated that a plaintiff is a\r\nprevailing party under  1988 \"when actual relief on the merits of\r\nhis claim materially alters the legal relationship between the\r\nparties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that\r\ndirectly benefits the plaintiff,\" and that \"[a] judgment for\r\ndamages in any amount, whether compensatory or nominal, modifies\r\nthe defendant's behavior by forcing the defendant to pay an amount\r\nof money he otherwise would not pay.\" Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S.\r\n103, 111-12, 113 (1992).  Since Schneider and Ramos each received\r\none dollar in nominal damages, they are \"prevailing parties\" who\r\n\"crossed the threshold to a fee award of some kind.\" Garland, 489\r\nU.S. at 792.\r\n\nC. The size of the fee award\r\n1. Degree of success\r\nWhile \"the degree of a plaintiff's success in relation to\r\nthe other goals of the lawsuit\" is not relevant to his \"eligibility\r\nfor a fee award,\" it is \"a factor critical to the determination of\r\nthe size of a reasonable fee.\" Garland, 489 U.S. at 790. The\r\nColegio contends that the overall fee award should have been\r\nreduced because Schneider and Ramos achieved limited success when\r\nthe litigation is viewed as a whole, and, in particular, plaintiffs\r\nfailed to achieve the goal \"closest to [their] heart[s],\"\r\noverturning mandatory membership. Evaluating the extent of success\r\nfor purposes of fees award reduction is assigned to the trial\r\ncourt's discretion and our review is appropriately deferential. See\r\nHensley, 461 U.S. at 437 (\"court necessarily has discretion\" in\r\nmaking equitable judgment as to fees award reduction for limited\r\nsuccess).\r\nThe Supreme Court has stated that \"'the most critical\r\nfactor' in determining the reasonableness of a fee award 'is the\r\ndegree of success obtained.'\" Farrar, 506 U.S. at 114 (quoting\r\nHensley, 461 U.S. at 436). Where a plaintiff recovers \"only nominal\r\ndamages . . . the only reasonable fee is usually no fee at all.\"\r\nFarrar, 506 U.S. at 115. However, this principle applies only\r\n\"'[w]here recovery of private damages is the purpose of civil\r\nrights litigation.'\" Id. at 114 (quoting Riverside v. Rivera, 477\r\nU.S. 561, 585 (1986) (Powell, J., concurring)). Damages were never\r\na significant issue to the plaintiffs in this litigation. Rather,\r\nSchneider and Ramos sought and achieved far more than an award of\r\nindividual money damages in this case. They sought primarily to\r\nvindicate their constitutional rights through injunctive relief.\r\nAlthough compulsory Colegio membership was ultimately held to be\r\nconstitutional, this holding was subject to a significant\r\nqualification: the Colegio would no longer be allowed to use dues\r\nand stamp proceeds to support ideological purposes outside of the\r\ncore purposes of a bar association, and it was forced to institute\r\nprocedures to refund to dissenting attorneys dues that were\r\nearmarked for such ideological purposes. As the district court put\r\nit: \"[T]he success of plaintiffs in winning an alteration of the\r\nmethod by which dues were assessed and collected by the Colegio was\r\na victory of major proportions for the constitutional rights of\r\nColegio members. . . . Its significance is not diminished by the\r\nfact that there were a good number of issues on which plaintiffs\r\ndid not prevail.\" Schneider X, slip op. at 1.\r\nThe Supreme Court has stated that \"[w]here a lawsuit\r\nconsists of related claims, a plaintiff who has won substantial\r\nrelief should not have his attorney's fee reduced simply because\r\nthe district court did not adopt each contention raised.\" Hensley,\r\n461 U.S. at 440. Claims are related where they \"involve a common\r\ncore of facts or [are] based on related legal theories,\" or where\r\ncounsel's time is \"devoted generally to the litigation as a whole,\r\nmaking it difficult to divide the hours expended on a claim-by-\r\nclaim basis.\"  Id. at 435; see also Coutin v. Young &amp; Rubicam\r\nPuerto Rico, Inc., 124 F.3d 331, 339 (1st Cir. 1997) (claims\r\nunrelated where they \"rest on different facts and legal theories\"\r\n(emphasis added)). Here the district court specifically found that\r\n\"[t]hose claims in which plaintiffs failed to prevail were\r\nreasonably related to the claim on which they succeeded. The\r\n[failed] claims were not distinct in all respects\" and therefore\r\nhours expended pursuing them were properly considered in assessing\r\nfees. Schneider IX, 947 F. Supp. at 42 (citing Hensley, 461 U.S. at\r\n440).\r\nThe Colegio and Secretaries claim the district court\r\nabused its discretion in reaching this conclusion. However, the\r\nunsuccessful efforts of Schneider and Ramos to overturn mandatory\r\nmembership and stamp use were closely related to their successful\r\nefforts to establish a dues reduction procedure and limits on the\r\nColegio's use of stamp proceeds. Both remedies pursued by\r\nplaintiffs (voluntary membership/stamp use and dues\r\nreduction/limits on stamp revenue use) were means to the same end:\r\nvindicating the constitutional rights of dissenters who did not\r\nwish to be forced to subsidize the Colegio's ideological\r\nactivities. Plaintiffs' based their pursuit of both alternate\r\nremedies on an identical \"core of facts\" documenting the Colegio's\r\nideological activities, and on \"related legal theories\" regarding\r\nthe underlying constitutional right in question; either identity\r\nwould be sufficient to establish the relatedness of the remedial\r\nclaims under the disjunctive standard of Hensley and Coutin, above.\r\nMoreover, it would be nearly impossible to \"divide the hours\r\nexpended on a claim-by-claim basis,\" Hensley, 461 U.S. at 435, even\r\nif the district court, in the exercise of its discretion, had\r\ndetermined that it was equitable to do so. I therefore conclude\r\nthat the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining\r\nto reduce the attorney's fees award because Schneider and Ramos did\r\nnot prevail on every claim they raised or achieve all the relief\r\nthey requested.\r\n\n2. The Commonwealth Court proceedings\r\nUnder certain conditions, federal courts have held that\r\nhours expended in state court proceedings are compensable under\r\n1988. We have, for example, held that hours expended in state\r\ncourt proceedings are compensable where those state proceedings\r\nwere initiated and pursued solely because of a federal court's\r\nPullman abstention subsequent to the initial filing of a federal\r\nclaim in the federal forum. See Exeter-West Greenwich Reg'l Sch.\r\nDist. v. Pontarelli, 788 F.2d 47 (1st Cir. 1986) (where  1983\r\naction halted under Pullman for certification of issue of Rhode\r\nIsland law to state supreme court, and state court's resolution\r\nmooted  1983 claim, attorney's fees properly awarded for hours\r\nspent on state court proceedings); see also Bartholomew v. Watson,\r\n665 F.2d 910 (9th Cir. 1982) (state court action compensable where\r\nstate proceedings initiated and pursued solely because of filing of\r\nfederal claim and subsequent Pullman abstention by federal court).\r\nClearly, therefore, all hours expended on proceedings before the\r\nSupreme Court of Puerto Rico subsequent to our 1984 abstention\r\nruling and leading to its June 1986 opinion, and any subsequent\r\nSupreme Court of Puerto Rico proceedings, are eligible for\r\ncompensation. Section 1983 was part of the litigation by then, and\r\nfederal court abstention made the prosecution of the Commonwealth\r\nproceedings necessary to the advancement of the federal proceeding.\r\nThe Colegio argues that hours spent in the disciplinary\r\nproceeding in the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico from 1977 to\r\nplaintiff's 1982 disbarment, prior to the filing of the federal\r\nclaim, should not be compensable under  1988 since the\r\ndisciplinary proceeding preceded the filing of the federal claim\r\nbut was not a legally necessary precursor to the filing of that\r\nclaim. On this line of argument, Schneider and Ramos should have\r\nraised their federal constitutional defenses to the disbarment\r\nproceedings immediately (instead of reserving them) and should then\r\nhave attempted to remove the case to federal court. Better yet,\r\naccording to the logic of the Colegio, they might have preempted\r\nthe disbarment action by filing a complaint seeking declaratory\r\nrelief in federal court under  1983, instead of simply letting\r\ntheir dues payments lapse and waiting for the Colegio to commence\r\ndisciplinary proceedings in the Commonwealth Court. However, they\r\nchose to allow the disciplinary proceedings to commence and then\r\nintentionally reserved their federal ( 1983) defenses. The Colegio\r\nclaims that this course of conduct left the 1977-1982 disciplinary\r\nproceedings essentially unrelated to the  1983 action that\r\neventually followed, and thus any hours expended on the\r\ndisciplinary proceedings should not be compensable under  1988.\r\nIn ordering more proceedings on the subject of attorney's\r\nfees in its October 1996 ruling, the district court stated that\r\n\"[a]bsent a showing that these hours[ claimed for work in\r\nCommonwealth Court proceedings], or any part of them, were either\r\ndone for the benefit of this federal litigation or necessary to\r\nmaintain or advance this litigation, or otherwise connected to or\r\nrequired by this litigation, such work is not covered by 42 U.S.C.\r\n1988.\" Schneider IX, 947 F. Supp. at 42 (citing Webb v. County\r\nBd. of Educ., 471 U.S. 234 (1985)). Ultimately, however, the court\r\njustified its actual fees award not on Webb but rather on its\r\nconclusion that the Commonwealth Court proceedings of 1977-1982\r\nwould have been part of any federal  1983 action because of the\r\ninevitability of Pullman abstention on the facts of this case.\r\nSpecifically, the district court stated that \"[c]lose scrutiny has\r\nbeen given to plaintiffs' claim for attorney[']s fees incurred in\r\nthe Commonwealth court proceedings from November 1977 . . . to June\r\n9, 1982 [the date of filing the federal action].\" Schneider X, slip\r\nop. at 3. Noting that this litigation did not have the \"'neat'\r\nhistory of an action in which the federal court immediately\r\nabstained in order to allow a state action to proceed,\" the court\r\nnevertheless concluded that \"the conduct and conclusion of the\r\nCommonwealth proceeding was eventually recognized as a necessary\r\nprerequisite and adjunct to the federal action.\" Id. at 4.\r\nI cannot agree with this rationale, grounded as it is on\r\nthe inevitability of the 1977-1982 Commonwealth proceedings even if\r\nSchneider and Ramos had filed their federal claims in federal court\r\nprior to the commencement of the disciplinary proceedings in 1977.\r\nPullman abstention is a discretionary practice of federal courts,\r\npremised on both prudential and federalism/comity concerns, see\r\nPullman, 312 U.S. at 500-01, and it is therefore impossible to say\r\nwith certainty that a federal court would have ordered abstention\r\non a given set of facts. See Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360, 375\r\n(1964) (\"The abstention doctrine is not an automatic rule applied\r\nwhenever a federal court is faced with a doubtful issue of state\r\nlaw; it rather involves a discretionary exercise of a court's\r\nequity powers.\"); Erwin Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction 742 (3d\r\ned. 1999) (\"abstention doctrines are derived from the discretion\r\ninherent to courts of equity\" (citing Quackenbush v. Allstate\r\nInsurance Co., 517 U.S. 706, 722-26 (1996)); id. at 747-48\r\n(acknowledging contradictory precedent but stating \"[t]he\r\npreferable approach is to treat abstention as discretionary\").\r\nIt is true that we have awarded fees for hours spent\r\ndefending state court proceedings that were not the product of a\r\nfederal court's abstention. In Stathos v. Bowden, 728 F.2d 15 (1st\r\nCir. 1984), an employer, anticipating a  1983 suit by two\r\nemployees, brought an action seeking a declaratory judgment under\r\nMassachusetts' sex discrimination statute in state court prior to\r\nthe filing of a federal claim by the employees. The employees\r\npromptly brought a federal  1983 claim in federal court, and then\r\nimmediately sought to dismiss the preemptive state action brought\r\nby the employer by citing the pending federal case. The state\r\naction was then stayed pending resolution of the federal case. See\r\nMunicipal Lighting Commission of Peabody v. Stathos, 433 N.E.2d 95,\r\n96 (Mass. App. Ct. 1982) (detailing chronology). We held that the\r\nhours spent by the employees in defending the state declaratory\r\njudgment action were a \"necessary part of [the employees'] efforts\r\nto achieve their  1983 goal\" (and thus compensable under  1988)\r\nsince the \"issues in the state suit were virtually the same as in\r\nthe federal case\" and the employees \"were forced to defend [the\r\nstate case] lest they lose their  1983 claim in the federal courts\r\nthrough collateral estoppel.\" 728 F.2d at 22.\r\nWhile the Colegio's attempt to disbar Schneider and Ramos\r\nmight seem analogous to the preemptive action taken by the employer\r\nin Stathos, the situations are distinguishable. Schneider and Ramos\r\ndid not move to cut short the state proceedings by instituting a\r\nseparate  1983 action in district court and then moving to halt\r\nthe Puerto Rico Supreme Court proceedings pending action in the\r\nfederal court (as did the employee-plaintiffs in Stathos), nor did\r\nthey raise federal defenses in the Commonwealth proceedings and\r\nseek removal to the district court. Here, unlike the employees in\r\nStathos, Schneider and Ramos were not at risk of losing their\r\nclaims through collateral estoppel or res judicata (issue or claim\r\npreclusion, respectively) predicated on the Puerto Rico Supreme\r\nCourt's resolution of the issues before it. See Schneider I, 546 F.\r\nSupp. at 1268-74 (pre-1982 state proceedings not res judicata as to\r\nfederal proceedings; collateral estoppel also not applicable);\r\nSchneider VI, 670 F. Supp. at 1104 (same). Rather, they attempted\r\nto prevail on Commonwealth law grounds in the Puerto Rico Supreme\r\nCourt while reserving all federal/ 1983 claims. They therefore\r\nhave no claim to hours expended on the disciplinary proceedings\r\nunder Stathos.\r\nThe Supreme Court has stated in Webb v. Board of\r\nEducation of Dyer County, Tennessee, 471 U.S. 234, 243 (1985), that\r\neven hours spent pursuing procedurally-optional proceedings prior\r\nto the commencement of the federal litigation may be compensable\r\nwhere the work done in those optional proceedings was \"both useful\r\nand of a type ordinarily necessary to advance\" a later federal\r\nclaim. There the Supreme Court held that because exhaustion of\r\nadministrative remedies was not a prerequisite to a  1983 claim,\r\nplaintiff Webb was not entitled to attorney's fees for \"all\" work\r\ndone in (optional) administrative proceedings he chose to pursue\r\nbefore his federal  1983 action was filed. The court held the\r\nprevailing plaintiff to his contention (which he argued\r\nconsistently in the courts below) that \"all of the hours spent by\r\nhis attorney\" in the optional administrative proceeding were\r\n\"reasonably expended\" to enforce rights under  1983. Id. at 242\r\n(emphasis added). \"The question argued below was whether the time\r\nspent on the administrative work during the years before [the\r\nfiling of the  1983 claim in] August 1979 should be included in\r\nits entirety or excluded in its entirety. On this record, the\r\nDistrict Court correctly held that all of the administrative work\r\nwas not compensable.\" Id. at 243 (emphasis added). \"The petitioner\r\nmade no suggestion below that any discrete portion of the work\r\nproduct from the administrative proceedings was work that was both\r\nuseful and of a type ordinarily necessary to advance\" the  1983\r\nclaim. Id. (emphasis added). Whether or not facts like those in\r\nWebb might ordinarily support a partial fee award, the \"all-or-\r\nnothing\" nature of the plaintiff's fee claims in Webb precluded\r\nsuch a result.\r\nIn the case before us, we have no indication that\r\nSchneider and Ramos made claims in any way distinguishable from\r\nthose made by Webb. Webb's attorney's fees claims in the district\r\ncourt contained an \"itemized description of the time spent\" in the\r\nancillary administrative proceedings. Id. at 238. Schneider's and\r\nRamos' application did the same, detailing specific tasks and hours\r\nspent thereon in the disciplinary proceedings. However, in Webb\r\nthis approach was found to be insufficient, given that Webb\r\npresented only evidence \"that the administrative work in its\r\nentirety was 'useful' and 'necessary' to the outcome of the\r\nlitigation.\" Id. at 257 (Brennan, J., dissenting in part and\r\nconcurring in part) (emphasis added). Schneider and Ramos argued\r\nbelow that the \"total\" hours expended in the 1977-1982 disciplinary\r\nproceedings were compensable, on the theory that \"litigation in the\r\nPuerto Rico Supreme Court of the 1977 case Colegio v. Schneider et\r\nal[.,] was a necessary and indispensable condition precedent to and\r\npart of this case.\" Motion for Attorneys Fees, Dkt. 257 (Sep. 28,\r\n1988), at 6. Later, after the Schneider IX decision, they argued\r\nthat a \"prior ruling by the highest State [sic] Court on the\r\nConstitutionality of said laws under the Constitution of the\r\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico was a prerequisite to the federal\r\nclaim, irrespective of whether said ruling was prior to or after\r\nthe institution of the suit in the Federal [sic] Court [sic]\r\nchallenging the constitutionality of said laws under the U.S.\r\nConstitution.\" Motion in Compliance with October 30, 1996 Order,\r\nDkt. 382 (Feb. 7, 1997), at 3. Both statements present all-or-\r\nnothing claims similar to those rejected in Webb. The statements\r\nalso mirror the inevitability theory put forward by the district\r\ncourt, a theory I have rejected, above. In fact, Schneider and\r\nRamos did not articulate below (or on appeal) any viable theory for\r\nwhy some \"discrete portion\" of the hours spent in the disciplinary\r\nproceedings should be compensable as \"useful and . . . ordinarily\r\nnecessary\" under Webb.\r\nI therefore concur in the conclusion that we must reject\r\nthe claim of Schneider and Ramos for attorney's fees for hours\r\nspent prior to June 3, 1982 on Commonwealth Court proceedings, and\r\nmust adjust the district court's award, eliminating those amounts\r\nowing to hours expended prior to June 3, 1982 on Commonwealth Court\r\nproceedings. In total these hours accounted for $13,872.20 of the\r\ndistrict court's fees award, and this deduction results in a\r\nreduced award of $230,975.92, plus costs and with interest from\r\nSeptember 22, 1988 as per the district court's order.\r\n\n3. Miscellaneous claims for adjusting the fee award\r\nThe Colegio contends that the court should have adjusted\r\nthe fee award downwards for work on losing claims advanced by\r\nplaintiffs. I have already considered and rejected these \"partial\r\nsuccess\" fee reduction arguments in my discussion of the degree of\r\nsuccess issue, above. The Colegio also objects to the court's\r\nfailure to reduce the fee award for hours spent on motions by\r\nplaintiffs that were dismissed, for allegedly excessive hours\r\nclaimed for individual tasks, and for clerical tasks allegedly\r\ninappropriately performed by lawyers. The district court gave these\r\nclaims careful consideration in rejecting the majority of them,\r\nsee Schneider X, slip op. at 5-6, and we have properly refrained\r\nfrom disturbing its exercise of discretion here.\r\nCiting no authority, see Appellant's Br. at 34-37, the\r\nColegio and Secretaries challenge the district court's refusal to\r\ndiscount the fees award for time spent by plaintiffs pursuing\r\nunsuccessful or partially successful appeals to this court. The\r\nSchneider II proceeding, for instance, resulted in the grant of a\r\nwrit of mandamus to the defendant/petitioner Justices, reducing\r\nthem to nominal parties; our decision in the Schneider V appeal\r\nvacated the district court's decision in favor of plaintiffs and\r\nordered abstention; and our Schneider VIII decision temporarily\r\nstayed an injunction granting relief sought by plaintiffs. However,\r\n\"the prevalent approach\" to determining whether a plaintiff is a\r\nprevailing party \"on appeal[] is to inquire whether the plaintiff\r\nhas prevailed in the litigation as a whole.\" John E. Kirklin,\r\nSection 1983 Litigation: Statutory Attorney's Fees 29 (3d. ed.\r\n1997); see also Cabrales v. County of Los Angeles, 935 F.2d 1050,\r\n1053 (9th Cir. 1991) (\"a plaintiff who is unsuccessful at a stage\r\nof litigation that was a necessary step to her ultimate victory is\r\nentitled to attorney's fees even for the unsuccessful stage\");\r\nBuffington v. Baltimore County, 913 F.2d 113, 128 n.12 (4th Cir.\r\n1990) (district court need not revisit fees award for first trial,\r\nwhich ended in mistrial, where plaintiff prevailed in subsequent\r\ntrial); Alizadeh v. Safeway Stores, Inc., 910 F.2d 234, 237-38 (5th\r\nCir. 1990) (fees awarded for work on appeal which resulted in\r\nreversal of summary judgment in favor of Safeway, which then\r\nprevailed at trial; ultimate success on merits made award of \"fees\r\nfor the entire course of the litigation\" reasonable exercise of\r\ndistrict court's discretion);  Ustrak v. Fairman, 851 F.2d 983, 990\r\n(7th Cir. 1988) (plaintiff had prima facie entitlement to \"entire\r\nfees in this court\" on appeal (from fees award) where fee award was\r\naffirmed but reduced by a third); Dougherty v. Barry, 820 F. Supp.\r\n20, 25 (D.D.C. 1993) (rejecting attempt to bifurcate failure on\r\nappeal from success at trial; reasonable fees would be \"determined\r\nby examination of the entire case\").\r\nHere, Schneider and Ramos ultimately succeeded in\r\nachieving a significant portion of the relief sought, despite a\r\nnumber of backwards steps along the convoluted pathway this\r\nlitigation took through the courts (including this court of\r\nappeals). I have no difficulty concluding that the district court\r\nwas within its discretion in refusing to discount hours spent in\r\nunsuccessfully defending appeals, especially where the appellate\r\nsetbacks suffered by plaintiffs were largely procedural in nature\r\n(here, reducing the justices from defendants to nominal defendants,\r\npostponing (temporarily, as it turned out) the exercise of federal\r\njurisdiction, and temporarily postponing the effectiveness of an\r\ninjunction). Cf. Jaffee v. Redmond, 142 F.3d 409, 414 (7th Cir.\r\n1998) (an \"unsuccessful but reasonable argument in support of a\r\nsuccessful claim may be compensable.\"). The result might be\r\ndifferent were the unsuccessful appeals initiated by the\r\nplaintiffs, but that was not the case for the three appeals to this\r\ncourt mentioned above. See Ustrak, 851 F.2d at 990 (for purposes of\r\ndetermining whether unsuccessful appeal is sufficiently related to\r\nplaintiff's success, \"a distinction should be made between an\r\nappellant and an appellee\"; where \"defendant appeals and plaintiff\r\nincurs expenses in defending against the appeal that are reasonable\r\neven though they are not crowned by complete success,\"\r\nplaintiff/appellee should be awarded fees since \"he had no choice\r\nbut to incur them or forfeit his victory in the district court.\").\r\n\nD. Refund of dues\r\n1. Background\r\nThe district court's final judgment in this matter,\r\nSchneider XI at 1-2, included an order resolving dissenters' claims\r\nto a refund of dues amounts corresponding to ideological activities\r\nof the Colegio during years prior to the institution of the final\r\ndues reduction procedure outlined in the 1993 rules promulgated by\r\nthe Supreme Court of Puerto Rico. Before responding to the parties'\r\nobjections to the district court's dues refund order, I must review\r\nthe history of that court's orders concerning dues payments during\r\nthe pendency of this case, including the dues payments that were\r\nactually made by plaintiffs (relying primarily on the briefs on\r\nappeal and cross-appeal for much of the payment data, which is\r\nabsent from the record).\r\nSchneider ceased to pay dues in 1974, Ramos in 1976. See\r\nSchneider I, 546 F. Supp. at 1255. Our 1984 abstention decision\r\nstated that a pure refund remedy was inadequate (a similar plan\r\nhaving been rejected by the Supreme Court in Ellis v. Brotherhood\r\nof Railway, Airline &amp; Steamship Clerks, 466 U.S. 435, 441-44, 104\r\nS. Ct. 1883, 1889-90 (1984), on the grounds that the amount to be\r\nrebated constitutes an \"involuntary loan\" to the union), and that\r\nthe Supreme Court of Puerto Rico should adopt an interim rule\r\nallowing for a portion of dissenters' dues payments to be held in\r\nescrow. See Schneider V, 742 F.2d at 44. We suggested that a\r\nreasonable interim remedy would allow dissenters to pay 50% of dues\r\ninto escrow. See id. at 44-45. This recommended interim remedy was\r\napproved on November 13, 1984 by the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico,\r\nwhich allowed readmission of dissenters upon compliance; with\r\nrespect to Schneider and Ramos, the Court allowed them to pay 50%\r\nof their dues into escrow for all dues years for which they had\r\nvoiced objection to Colegio ideological activities. See Dkt. 328,\r\nExh. A (Nov. 13, 1984 order of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico).\r\nThe parties stipulated terms for the escrow account,\r\nincluding requirements that the name of the bank holding the\r\naccount and the account number be disclosed to dissenters, and that\r\nthe Supreme Court of Puerto Rico would order the Colegio \"not to\r\nwithdraw any amount of money from this [Escrow] Account until the\r\nclaims in dispute have been finally resolved by the Supreme Court\r\nof Puerto Rico, and, if it were necessary, by the federal courts.\"\r\nBl. Br. (cross appeal) at 7-8 (quoting Dkt. 328, Exh. B, at 2). The\r\nstipulation was signed by the parties on Jan. 23, 1985, and on Jan.\r\n31, 1985, Schneider and Ramos paid the Colegio 50% of their dues\r\ncorresponding to years 1978-1985 inclusive, and an equal amount\r\ninto the escrow account. At the same time, Schneider paid his full\r\ndues for years 1974-1977 directly to the Colegio as well, see Red\r\nBr. (cross appeal) at 21, and Ramos similarly paid full dues for\r\n1976-1977 directly to the Colegio, see Red Br. (cross appeal) at\r\n22; neither plaintiff paid any amount into escrow for those dues\r\nyears. In 1986 Schneider and Ramos paid appropriate amounts to the\r\nColegio and the escrow account for their 1986 dues. See Red Br.\r\n(cross appeal) at 22. The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico's 1986\r\nremedy provided that 15% of dues could be paid to escrow for dues\r\nyears from 1987 onwards. See Colegio II, 17 T.P.R. at 634. Nothing\r\nin the briefs or record on appeal indicates whether or not\r\nSchneider or Ramos paid any dues for 1987 or 1988.\r\nIn 1988 the district court enjoined the Colegio from\r\nmandating bar membership or dues payments, see Schneider VII, 682\r\nF. Supp. at 691; after a grace period, this injunction appears to\r\nhave gone into effect on May 31, 1988 (although the record is far\r\nfrom clear; the injunction may have been stayed pending appeal). We\r\nsuspended effectiveness of the injunction for 6 months in 1990, but\r\nallowed 100% of dues to be escrowed during this stay. See Schneider\r\nVIII, 917 F.2d at 636. After the 6 months expired, petitions for\r\ncertiorari were filed by all parties, and the district court\r\nextended our stay pending resolution of these certiorari petitions.\r\nThe Supreme Court denied certiorari in January 1992. See 502 U.S.\r\n1029 (1992). In June 1992, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico issued\r\nnew rules governing dues that allowed dissenters to pay a\r\nproportionately lower dues amount based on the Colegio's budget for\r\nunobjectionable activities. Schneider admits not making dues\r\npayments for the dues year 1989 and every year afterwards. See Red\r\nBr. at 12. As for Ramos, the Colegio indicates that he paid dues\r\nfrom 1989 to 1992 and paid the full, undiscounted amount to the\r\nColegio for 1993, see Red Br. (cross appeal) at 21; there is no\r\nindication of whether Ramos paid some or all of his dues for 1989-\r\n1992 into the escrow account.\r\nThe 1992 rules promulgated by the Supreme Court of Puerto\r\nRico established a Review Board to deal with disputes over\r\ncategorization of expenses. On May 24, 1995, the Colegio appeared\r\nbefore the Board to present its dues refund proposal for dues years\r\n1985-1992. On August 29, 1995, the Review Board issued a decision\r\ndetermining amounts for refund to plaintiffs in conformity with the\r\nColegio's proposal. For dues years 1989-1992, the amount to be\r\nrefunded was determined on the basis of an independent accounting\r\nfor that portion of the Colegio budget spent on ideological\r\nactivities; for other years where no accounting was done, the\r\ntotal portion of dues (50% for 1985-1986 and 15% for 1987-1988)\r\npaid into escrow was ordered refunded; in each case, refunds were\r\nto include interest. Notwithstanding the Review Board's\r\npronouncement, further proceedings in the district court took place\r\nin order to resolve the refund issue. After reviewing the\r\ncontentions of both parties, the court determined that \"the fairest\r\nway to resolve\" the refund issue was to avoid determining exactly\r\nwhat percentage of the Colegio budget for past years was\r\nattributable to ideological activities, Schneider IX, 947 F. Supp.\r\nat 42, and ultimately ordered that all moneys that had been paid\r\ninto escrow but were as yet unrefunded should be returned to\r\nplaintiffs, with interest. See Schneider XI at 1-2.\r\n\n2. The Colegio's objection to the dues refund order\r\nThe Colegio argues that the district court's \"Memorandum,\r\nOpinion and Order\" of Oct. 30, 1996, Schneider IX, 947 F. Supp. at\r\n42, \"augments\" the amount of dues to be refunded to plaintiffs,\r\nover and above the limited refunds of escrowed dues approved by the\r\nReview Board in 1995. The district court's final judgment ordered\r\nthe refund of all dues deposited in escrow, whereas the Review\r\nBoard approved only a partial refund for the years 1989-1992,\r\nfollowing the results of its independent accounting. For example,\r\nfor years 1990-1992, dissenters were allowed to pay 100% of their\r\ndues into escrow, all of which would be refundable to dissenters\r\nunder the district court's refund plan, whereas the Review Board\r\ndetermined that only a small portion of those payments would be\r\nrefunded based on its accounting of ideological-activity related\r\nexpenses for those years. However, in developing its argument, the\r\nColegio does not claim that this \"augmentation\" of the refund is\r\nsubstantively unfair (with one minor exception addressed below),\r\nbut only claims that the Review Board's determination of the issue\r\nshould have had a preclusive effect on the district court. I find\r\nnothing about the Review Board proceedings and refund order that\r\nindicates its conclusions should be binding on the parties to the\r\nfederal case. The refund issue had been a part of the federal case\r\nfor many years, see, e.g., Schneider VII, 682 F. Supp. at 675, it\r\nremained so, and the district court was well within its power in\r\nchoosing to resolve it as it did.\r\nThe Colegio also seems to imply that the 1996 Opinion\r\nunfairly \"augments\" the dues refund by ordering the Colegio to pay\r\nSchneider a refund (in the amount of 50% of compulsory dues) for\r\nyears in which Schneider did not in fact pay any dues. The October\r\n1996 order states: \"To the extent that, in any year of the ...\r\nperiod [during which dues were partially escrowed], the refund by\r\nthe Colegio to plaintiffs was less than 50% of the compulsory dues,\r\nthe difference shall be paid to plaintiffs with interest from the\r\nend of that membership year.\" Schneider IX, 947 F. Supp. at 42.\r\nThis language might be read to mean that, had no dues been paid\r\ninto escrow by a plaintiff, and thus no dues refunded, the Colegio\r\nwould nonetheless owe said plaintiff the difference between the\r\namount refunded (zero) and half the compulsory dues, resulting in\r\na windfall for the plaintiff. However, the court's final order of\r\nMarch 23, 1998 states its mandate somewhat differently:\r\n  3. That, for the years in which plaintiffs and\r\nother lawyers, following the commencement of\r\nthis action up to the promulgation of the\r\nrules referred to above, paid 50% or another\r\nportion of their annual compulsory dues into\r\nan escrow account and said amounts have not\r\nbeen refunded, then the Colegio shall refund\r\nthe unrefunded amounts together with interest\r\non those amounts from the end of the\r\nmembership year for which they were deposited.\r\n\nSchneider XI at 1-2 (D. Puerto Rico March 23, 1998). This provision\r\nclearly covers only \"paid\" and \"unrefunded\" amounts, which by\r\ndefinition could not include amounts never paid by plaintiffs or\r\namounts already refunded under the plan approved by the Colegio's\r\nBoard of Review, if any. To the extent that any language in the\r\nearlier opinion of the court could be interpreted to the contrary,\r\nit is superseded by the text of this final order.\r\n                            III.\r\n                      The Cross-Appeal\r\nA. The adequacy of the dues refund\r\nOn cross-appeal Schneider and Ramos assert that the dues\r\nrefund order did not go far enough, and should have included an\r\norder for dues refunds for the ten years prior to the court's\r\nopinion and findings of fact in Schneider v. Colegio, 565 F. Supp.\r\n963 (D.P.R. 1983). The district court's findings of fact are\r\ndetailed in the appendix to its opinion entitled \"Supplementary\r\nFindings and Conclusions\":\r\n  30. The official positions, activities and\r\nactions of the Colegio over the past ten years\r\nevidence a pattern of conduct by the Colegio\r\nto engage in, and to use the facilities,\r\npersonnel and resources of the Colegio for\r\nideological or political activity without\r\nrestriction or limitation in the name and\r\nrepresentation of all the members of the\r\nColegio, including Plaintiffs.\r\n\nSchneider III, 565 F. Supp. at 982-83 (emphasis added). That\r\nopinion was vacated on appeal, but the district court later\r\nregarded its earlier factual findings as either the law of the case\r\n(since not appealed from) or incorporated into the later opinion.\r\nSee, e.g., Schneider VII, 682 F. Supp. at 678-79. Schneider and\r\nRamos claim the court's 1998 order should have mandated further\r\nrefunds to cover the Colegio's use of dues for ideological\r\nactivities during the ten year period described in the court's 1983\r\nfinding. This period includes years for which no portion of dues\r\nwas paid into the escrow account; such amounts would not be covered\r\nby the court's 1998 refund order.\r\nSchneider and Ramos did not properly preserve this issue\r\nfor appeal. The district court first addressed the refund issue in\r\nits October 30, 1996 order, stating that plaintiffs claimed \"the\r\nColegio has not refunded to them the amount of dues properly\r\nattributable to non-core activities during the course of this\r\nlitigation.\" Schneider IX, 947 F. Supp. at 42. The court\r\nsubsequently requested that the parties submit proposed final\r\norders. Plaintiffs' proposed order provided only for refunds of\r\ndues paid into the escrow account \"during the period from June 9,\r\n1982 up to February 23, 1993.\" Dkt. 389, Dec. 5, 1997, Exhibit A,\r\nat 12. Schneider and Ramos thereby waived the issue of refunds of\r\ndues paid during any earlier period, and we have correctly refused\r\nto entertain their request to exhume it on appeal. See Poliquin v.\r\nGarden Way, Inc., 989 F.2d 527, 531 (1st Cir. 1993) (appellate\r\ncourts will not ordinarily resolve issues waived or abandoned at\r\ntrial).\r\n\nB. Construction of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico's rules\r\ngoverning the right to object to unbudgeted activities of the\r\nColegio\r\nThe district court issued an order, Dkt. 313, Nov. 19,\r\n1992, which mandated that the parties petition the Supreme Court of\r\nPuerto Rico to consider certain amendments to that Court's 1992\r\nrules governing membership in the Colegio and the Colegio's use of\r\ndues for ideological activities. The controversy at hand concerns\r\nlanguage in Rule 6(A), reproduced in context below (\"second-\r\ncategory activities\" are those activities not related to the core\r\npurposes of a bar association, or having \"ideological overtones\"):\r\n  Rule 5 Dues \r\n    (A) Bar members who choose to finance\r\nall Bar Association activities shall pay the\r\nannual dues fixed by the General Assembly in\r\naccordance with the law. \r\n    (B) Computation of annual dues for bar\r\nmembers who choose not to finance\r\nsecond-category activities shall be based on\r\nthe classification of the activities included\r\nin the Rule 4(B)(2) statement of income and\r\nexpenses. The annual dues shall be an amount\r\nequal to the proportion of the regular dues\r\nthat expenditures for first-category\r\nactivities bear to expenditures for all Bar\r\nAssociation activities carried out during the\r\nyear. \r\n    (C) Second-category activities shall\r\nnot be funded from loans or contributions to\r\nthe Bar Association, unless otherwise\r\nspecified by the person who makes the\r\ncontribution at the moment such contribution\r\nis made and it is thus accepted by the Bar\r\nAssociation upon receipt of the same. \r\n  Rule 6 Remedial mechanisms \r\n    (A) Any bar member who pays his Rule\r\n5(B) bar dues is entitled to resort to the\r\nReview Board of the Bar Association Activities\r\n(Review Board) created by these rules, with\r\nregard to: \r\n    (1) the classification of any\r\nparticular activity included in the audited\r\nstatement of income and expenses used as basis\r\nfor the computation of dues, and/or \r\n    (2) the real expenses of a given\r\nactivity. \r\n    (3) any nonbudgeted activity funded by\r\nfirst-category activity dues that arises\r\nduring the course of the year, with respect to\r\nclassification or amount of expense.\r\n\nRules relating to the use of the Puerto Rico Bar Association funds\r\ncollected from the payment of dues and from the sale of notarial\r\nand bar stamps, as amended, January 1993 (certified translation,\r\nDkt. 376) (emphasis added) (quoted in Schneider IX, 947 F. Supp. at\r\n39). The 1992 version of Rule 6(A), extant prior to the district\r\ncourt's order, was identical except for (3), which was added as\r\nper the district court's Nov. 18, 1992 order. However, the district\r\ncourt also recommended in its order that the highlighted language\r\nin the first line of Rule 6(A), above, be changed. The relevant\r\ntext of the district court's order follows: \r\n    Plaintiffs object to the remedial\r\nmechanisms of Rule 6. As the Rule now stands,\r\nmembers must elect not to finance budgeted,\r\nnoncore activities at the beginning of the\r\nyear. Only those members who elected not to\r\nfinance noncore activities may seek review of\r\nthe budget by the Review Board of the Bar\r\nAssociation Activities (\"Review Board\"). This\r\nrule provides no avenue to object to\r\nnonbudgeted, noncore items that arise\r\nthroughout the year, which if past experience\r\nis any indication, comprise the bulk of the\r\nnoncore activities.\r\n    Thus Rule 6 must be amended to allow\r\nall members (whether they objected to the\r\nprojected budget, or approved it initially,\r\nand later dissent from a nonbudgeted, noncore\r\nactivity that was funded from the core\r\nactivity budget) to dissent at any time during\r\nthe year, and to receive a refund should the\r\nReview Board grant their petition. The court\r\nnotes that at the hearing counsel for the\r\nColegio maintained that the Rules currently\r\ncontain such a provision, and conceded that\r\nsuch a provision should be added if the Rules\r\ndid not.\r\n    The following amendments should be made\r\nto Rule 6:\r\n      a) delete \"his Rule 5(B) bar\" from\r\n  lines 1-2 of Rule 6;\r\n      b) add \"(3) any nonbudgeted activity\r\n  funded by first-category activity dues\r\n  that arises during the course of the\r\n  year, with respect to classification or\r\n  amount of expense.\" after provision (2)\r\n  of Rule 6;\r\n\nOrder, Dkt. 313 at 2 (Torruella, J.) (emphasis added to 6(A)). The\r\nmandate at the end of the district court's order states that \"[t]he\r\nparties are hereby ordered to petition the Supreme Court of Puerto\r\nRico to consider the amendments to the Rules indicated herein.\" Id.\r\nat 5. Notwithstanding the district court's use of the term\r\n\"consider,\" in fact the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico adopted all\r\nthe changes except the amendment to lines 1-2 suggesting the\r\ndeletion of \"his Rule 5(b) bar\" from Rule 6.\r\nSchneider and Ramos allege that the motion the Colegio\r\nfiled with the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico did not include\r\nlanguage describing the district court's proposed amendment to\r\nlines 1-2 of Rule 6. They claim such presentation to the\r\nCommonwealth Court was mandatory (and imply that the failure to\r\npresent was hidden from the district court by the Colegio's failure\r\nto translate its motion into English). In response, the Colegio\r\nclaims the amendment was a mere \"suggestion\" by the court, but\r\nfurther claims to have presented the entire November 18, 1992 order\r\n(in English and in Spanish translation) to the Supreme Court of\r\nPuerto Rico. This dispute was raised before the district court\r\nafter Judge Watson replaced Judge Torruella in 1995. The district\r\ncourt's opinion of Oct. 30, 1996 states:\r\n    In their motion for entry of judgment\r\nand injunctive relief, plaintiffs have argued\r\nthat the Rule reproduced above limits the\r\nright to review to those who elected not to\r\nfinance non-core activities at the beginning\r\nof the year, i.e., when the budget was first\r\nannounced or approved. Plaintiffs claim that\r\nRule 6 of the Rules still does not provide a\r\nway to object to non-budgeted, non-core items\r\nthat arise during the year for the first time.\r\n    This claim is totally incorrect. At a\r\ntime when this judge had first entered the\r\ncase, and when a complete copy of the new rule\r\nwas not in the record, the adamancy with which\r\nthis claim was advanced caused this court to\r\nhold hearings and order that a certified\r\ntranslation of the new Rule be filed. But when\r\nall is said and done plaintiffs have been\r\nunable to point to any meaningful way in which\r\nthe new Rule fails to conform to the\r\nconstitutional standards laid out by this\r\ncourt and the court of appeals.\r\n\nSchneider IX, 947 F. Supp. at 41 (Watson, J.) (emphasis added). I\r\nconcur with this judgment.\r\nOn a literal reading, the 1993 Rules as amended might\r\nappear to prevent those who \"choose to finance all bar activities\"\r\n(and thus pay Rule 5(A) dues) from changing their minds mid-year\r\nand invoking the review procedures of Rule 6(A) (limited to those\r\nwho pay \"Rule 5(B) dues\") when an unforeseen activity belonging in\r\nthe \"second-category\" is funded from the core activity budget. On\r\nthis reading, advocated by Schneider and Ramos, the amended Rules\r\nestablish an \"all or nothing\" objection rule, as it were: only\r\nthose who choose not to fund any second category activities (by\r\npaying the reduced Rule 5(B) dues) may object mid-year under Rule\r\n6 to the categorization or accounting for costs of budgeted or\r\nunbudgeted activities.\r\nHowever, as the Colegio argues, other parts of the Rules\r\ncounter such an interpretation. Specifically, language in Rule 6(C)\r\nallows for objections to unbudgeted activities by those who\r\ninitially opted to fund all activities:\r\n  [Rule 6](C) Should the Review Board determine,\r\nafter adjudicating the petitions filed for the\r\nyear in question, that the expenses for\r\nsecond-category activities exceeded the\r\nbudget, it shall order the Bar Association to\r\nmake refunds to the bar members who chose not\r\nto finance such activities, or later objected\r\nto nonbudgeted, second-category activities,\r\nand to pay interest at the legal rate\r\nprevailing at the time when the dues were\r\npaid. The Review Board shall remit all funds\r\nto dissenters within a reasonable time. The\r\nReview Board shall order any fund surplus\r\nremitted to the Bar Association.\r\n\nRule 6(C) (1993 version) (quoted in Schneider IX, 947 F. Supp. at\r\n39-40) (emphasis added). The highlighted language was recommended\r\nby the district court's Nov. 18, 1992 order, and presumably was\r\ndesigned to be consistent with the other amendments recommended by\r\nthat order. It clearly presumes that the right to object is granted\r\neven to those members who declined the option of not paying dues\r\nfor second-category activities at the beginning of the year.\r\nAs more support for the Colegio's reading, I note that\r\nlanguage suggested by the district court and now incorporated into\r\nRule 9(B) seems to distinguish 6(A) petitions from \"nonbudgeted\r\nactivity\" petitions:\r\n  [Rule 9](B) A Rule 6(A) petition objecting to\r\nbudgeted items shall be filed before the final\r\ndate set for payment of the annual dues. All\r\npetitions objecting to non-budgeted items\r\nshall be filed within ten (10) working days\r\nafter the event or item occurs.\r\n\nRule 9(B) (1993 version) (quoted in Schneider IX, 947 F. Supp. at\r\n40) (emphasis added) (highlighted sections added in response to the\r\nNov. 18, 1992 order's proposed amendments). Again, this language\r\nclearly allows any dues payer to object to nonbudgeted activities\r\n(notwithstanding the \"Rule 5(B) dues\" restriction of Rule 6(A)).\r\nThe Colegio insists that the Rules must be read this way, the\r\ndistrict court agreed, and I concur: notwithstanding the limiting\r\nlanguage in Rule 6(A), any member of the Colegio who pays dues\r\n(whether they be Rule 5(A) dues or Rule 5(B) dues) may resort to\r\nthe Review Board in order to object to \"any nonbudgeted activity\r\nfunded by first-category activity dues that arises during the\r\ncourse of the year, with respect to classification or amount of\r\nexpense\" (as per Rule 6(A)(3)) and, if successful, receive an\r\nappropriate refund.\r\nSchneider and Ramos claim that the district court should\r\nhave been bound in its 1996 ruling by the order of the court in\r\n1992, which they claim established the \"law of the case,\" and\r\nshould have insisted that the new rule \"comply strictly\" with the\r\n1992 order's recommended changes to Rule 6(A). It is true that the\r\neffect of the district court's reading in 1996, and mine, is not\r\nexactly the same as the effect of the 1992 order's recommended\r\namendment to line 1 of Rule 6(A): had the amendment to Rule 6(A)\r\nbeen made, and the language \"his Rule 5(B) bar\" been deleted, a\r\nRule 5(A) dues payer would have been able to voice objection under\r\n6(A)(1) or (2) to classification or real expenses of budgeted\r\nitems. On the district court's reading in 1996, 5(A) dues payers\r\nmay not so object to treatment of budgeted items, but only to\r\ntreatment of \"any nonbudgeted activity funded by first-category\r\nactivity dues that arises during the course of the year,\" as per\r\nRule 6(A)(3). However, objections to budgeted activities by Rule\r\n5(A) dues payers were not contemplated by the reasoning of the\r\ndistrict court's 1992 order, which was concerned with only the\r\nright of any member \"to object to nonbudgeted, noncore items that\r\narise [during the course of] the year.\" Order, Nov. 19, 1992, Dkt.\r\n313, at 2. Since the reading of the district court in 1996 gives\r\nthe Rules the effect intended by the court's 1992 order, there is\r\nno law of the case problem.\r\n\nC. Sanctions for the Colegio's failure to notify the plaintiffs of\r\nits June 20, 1991 motion to stay judgment\r\nOur opinion of December 20, 1990 (Schneider VIII, 917\r\nF.2d at 636) stayed for six months the effectiveness of the\r\ndistrict court's 1988 judgment (Schneider VII) immediately\r\nenjoining the Colegio from compelling membership until it either\r\nceased all ideological activities or implemented an adequate system\r\nto protect dissenters' rights. We took that action to give the\r\nColegio time to submit to the district court a modified rule\r\ngoverning use of compulsory dues, in the hope that such a delay\r\nwould permit the preservation of the integrated bar while allowing\r\nthe Colegio to formulate a remedy for the constitutional problems\r\nhighlighted by this litigation. During the stay, all parties\r\nsubmitted petitions for certiorari to the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States. On June 20, 1991, the date on which our stay was\r\nto expire, the Colegio requested an extension of the stay pending\r\nthe Supreme Court's consideration. The Colegio did not notify\r\nSchneider of its motion requesting the stay. On July 19, 1991, the\r\ndistrict court granted the stay of the injunction as requested,\r\nand, according to the Colegio, notified all parties. Schneider\r\nclaims the Clerk's office failed to notify him. The Supreme Court\r\ndenied certiorari on January 13, 1992. On June 30, 1992, the\r\nSupreme Court of Puerto Rico promulgated rules governing use of\r\nColegio funds, effective July 1, 1992. On August 13, 1992,\r\nSchneider and Ramos moved for sanctions against the Colegio for\r\nfailing to notify them of its motion. The court denied their\r\nrequest.\r\nSchneider and Ramos claim that as a result of the\r\nColegio's failure to give notice, \"[p]laintiffs had every reason to\r\nassume that the injunction regarding the Colegio compulsory dues\r\nwas in effect and that they were under no obligation to pay Colegio\r\ncompulsory dues and plaintiffs relied on this assumption.\"\r\nSchneider and Ramos imply that they mistakenly failed to pay their\r\nnext installment of Colegio dues and were subject to renewed\r\ndisciplinary proceedings. According to their brief (we have nothing\r\nin the record to confirm this), on September 8, 1992, the Colegio\r\ncommenced a disciplinary action against Schneider and others as a\r\nresult of their failure to continue paying dues upon the extension\r\nof the stay; the case, AB92-90, remains dormant but pending in the\r\nSupreme Court of Puerto Rico.\r\nIn denying the motion for sanctions (in its order\r\nreviewing the new rules), the district court added an important\r\nqualifier to its order, which essentially responds to the claim of\r\nSchneider and Ramos:\r\n  Plaintiffs' motion for sanctions against the\r\nColegio de Abogados, for failure to notify\r\nplaintiffs that the court stayed the\r\nreimposition of the injunction against the\r\nColegio, is denied. The plaintiffs are not\r\nrelieved from payment of their annual\r\nmembership dues and must do so within fifteen\r\n(15) days from the filing of this Order if\r\nthey wish to retain membership in the Colegio.\r\nUpon payment of the dues owed by plaintiffs,\r\nthe Colegio is ordered to rescind any request\r\nfor disbarment that may have been filed as a\r\nresult of plaintiffs' failure to timely pay\r\ntheir dues.\r\n\nOrder of Nov. 18, 1992 (Dkt. 313), at 1-2 (emphasis added). Federal\r\nRule of Civil Procedure 5 requires that all parties not in default\r\nbe served with essentially all papers and pleadings filed\r\nsubsequent to the original complaint. The rule itself does not\r\nspecify what sanctions are appropriate for violations. Where the\r\nmoving party has failed to serve a motion on the nonmoving party,\r\ncourts have struck or denied the motion or set aside the relief\r\nrequested in the motion if already granted. See 4A Charles Alan\r\nWright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure  1143 n.13\r\n(citing cases). Although the court stated that it was denying\r\nplaintiffs' motion for sanctions, it established a grace period for\r\npayment of any dues that plaintiffs mistakenly failed to pay as a\r\nresult of their lack of notice, and thereby mitigated any prejudice\r\nto plaintiffs resulting from the failure to give notice. Schneider\r\nand Ramos do not indicate exactly what further sanction they\r\nrequested below, if any, and any specific argument for further\r\nsanctions is thus waived.\r\n\nD. The Colegio's withdrawal of funds from the escrow account in\r\n1986\r\nThe Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, by resolution of\r\nNovember 13, 1984, as modified by stipulation of the parties on\r\nJanuary 23, 1985, adopted an interim remedy in consonance with the\r\nproposals of this court in Schneider V, 742 F.2d 32, 44-45 (1st\r\nCir. 1984). Under this interim remedy, disbarred plaintiffs could\r\nrequest readmittance if they paid half their dues to the Colegio\r\nand half into an interest-bearing escrow account, where the funds\r\nwould be held until the parties and the courts worked out a final\r\nrefund procedure. Plaintiffs were allowed to escrow half their dues\r\npayable back to the first membership year for which they objected\r\nto the Colegio's ideological activities. As of December 1986,\r\nSchneider had deposited 50% of his dues for membership years 1978\r\nthrough 1986 in the escrow account; the other plaintiffs similarly\r\nhad paid half of their dues for certain years into the escrow\r\naccount. The parties stipulated that the Colegio would inform the\r\ndissenting attorneys depositing their dues into the escrow account\r\nof the account number and the name of the bank selected by the\r\nColegio to hold such account. The stipulation also provided that\r\nthe Colegio would not withdraw funds from the account \"until the\r\nclaims in dispute have been finally resolved by the Supreme Court\r\nof Puerto Rico.\" Dkt. 328, Exh. B, at 2.\r\nOn June 26, 1986, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico\r\nadopted a remedy providing for the deposit in an escrow account of\r\n15% of compulsory dues paid by any lawyer dissenting to ideological\r\nactivities of the Colegio. See Colegio II, 17 T.P.R. at 634. On\r\nDecember 24, 1986, the Colegio withdrew 70% of the balance\r\ndeposited in the escrow account and (according to plaintiffs) the\r\ntotal of the interest, leaving 30% of the deposit balances\r\nremaining in the escrow account. Since the amount originally\r\ndeposited in escrow was 50% of total dues, the 30% of deposit\r\nbalances remaining in escrow after the withdrawal corresponded to\r\n15% of total dues. Apparently the Colegio presumed that it was\r\nentitled by the terms of the 1986 remedy to reduce the dissenters'\r\ndues withholding for prior years from the 50% of total dues the\r\nSupreme Court of Puerto Rico mandated in 1984 to the 15% of total\r\ndues mandated by its 1986 decision. However, plaintiffs also claim\r\nthe Colegio withdrew all of the interest earned in the account, not\r\njust 70% of it. They also argue that nothing in the Supreme Court\r\nof Puerto Rico's opinion stated its 15%-withholding-based remedy\r\nwould be applied retroactively. Plaintiffs also allege they never\r\nreceived account statements, the name of the bank, or the number of\r\naccount, as required by the January 23, 1985 stipulation.\r\nIt is important to note what is not in dispute here:\r\nunder the district court's 1998 order, every plaintiff should\r\nultimately receive refunds equal to the total amounts originally\r\ndeposited in escrow (with interest on any previously-unrefunded\r\nportion):\r\n  [F]or the years in which plaintiffs and other\r\nlawyers, following the commencement of this\r\naction up to the promulgation of the rules\r\nreferred to above, paid 50% or another portion\r\nof their annual compulsory dues into an escrow\r\naccount and said amounts have not been\r\nrefunded then the Colegio shall refund the\r\nunrefunded amounts together with interest on\r\nthose amounts from the end of the membership\r\nyear for which they were deposited.\r\n\nSchneider XI at 1-2. The Colegio must refund any amounts that were\r\n\"paid\" but \"unrefunded,\" regardless of how much actually remains in\r\nthe escrow account. At issue, then, is only the question of\r\nsanctions. I find no abuse of discretion in the district court's\r\nconclusion that \"the fairest way to resolve\" the refund dispute,\r\nSchneider IX, 947 F. Supp. at 42, was its refund order, without the\r\nimposition of any sanction.\r\n\nE. Hctor L. Mrquez's hours\r\nSchneider purports to argue on behalf of Hector L.\r\nMrquez-Figueroa, another attorney who represented dissenting\r\nattorneys in this litigation, that the court erred in not granting\r\nan award of attorney's fees for hours expended by Mrquez on behalf\r\nof plaintiffs Jorge F. Romany, Jorge Souss-Shidrewa, and Oreste V.\r\nRamos-Daz (the \"consolidated plaintiffs\") over the course of this\r\nlitigation. The Colegio argues that this part of the appeal was not\r\nproperly noticed, as the consolidated plaintiffs were not listed in\r\nthe caption of the notice of appeal filed by Schneider. That notice\r\nis captioned \"Robert E. Schneider, Jr., et als., plaintiffs.\"\r\nFederal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(c)(1)(A) states that the\r\nnotice of appeal must \"specify the party or parties taking the\r\nappeal by naming each one in the caption or body of the notice, but\r\nan attorney representing more than one party may describe those\r\nparties with such terms as 'all plaintiffs,' 'the defendants,' 'the\r\nplaintiffs A, B, et al.,' or 'all defendants except X'.\" (Emphasis\r\nadded.) Schneider, however, was not representing Mrquez's\r\n\"consolidated plaintiffs,\" and thus was not entitled to designate\r\nthose plaintiffs as appellants informally through the use of \"et\r\nal.\" in his notice of appeal. Although Federal Rule of Appellate\r\nProcedure 3(c)(4) states that \"[a]n appeal must not be dismissed\r\nfor informality of form or title of the notice of appeal, or for\r\nfailure to name a party whose intent to appeal is otherwise clear\r\nfrom the notice,\" this rule does not save the deficiency in the\r\nnotice of appeal: \"The failure to name a party in a notice of\r\nappeal is more than excusable 'informality'; it constitutes a\r\nfailure of that party to appeal.\" Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co.,\r\n487 U.S. 312, 314 (1988). The consolidated plaintiffs failed to\r\nappeal the court's award of attorney's fees, and we therefore lack\r\njurisdiction to consider the issue of Mrquez's fees for\r\nrepresenting them. See id. at 317.\r\n\nF. The liability of the Justices of the Supreme Court of Puerto\r\nRico for an award of attorney's fees\r\nSchneider and Ramos insist the court erred in holding\r\nthat the Justices of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico were not\r\nliable for any part of the attorney's fees award. The district\r\ncourt ruled that the Justices would not be liable for attorney's\r\nfees because they had been reduced to nominal parties early in the\r\ncase. See Schneider IX, 947 F. Supp. at 43 (fees ruling); Schneider\r\nII, 695 F.2d at 27 (Justices remain in case as nominal parties, but\r\nonly as to their \"administrative responsibilities in respect to the\r\nstamp statutes\"). Schneider and Ramos focus entirely (and\r\nunpersuasively) on the Justices' potential fees liability for their\r\n\"non-adjudicative enforcement\" and remedy-drafting actions,\r\nresponsibilities for which the Justices were not parties in this\r\ncase. The court's ruling was not an abuse of discretion.\r\n\nFor all of the reasons stated above, I concur with the\r\njudgment of the court.\n",

After two decades of litigation in the\r\nPuerto Rico and federal courts, plaintiffs Robert E. Schneider,\r\nJr., and Hctor Ramos-Daz succeeded in invalidating the use of bar\r\ndues for ideological purposes by the mandatory bar of Puerto Rico,\r\nthe Colegio de Abogados.  The action in the case at hand was a\r\ncivil rights action; the successful claims were of constitutional\r\ndimension.  Other claims were less successful.  The district court,\r\nacting pursuant to 42 U.S.C.  1988, awarded plaintiffs $244,848.12\r\nin attorney's fees plus costs and a refund in unrefunded compulsory\r\ndues.

Aug. 7, 1997).\r\nThe Colegio protests that there should have been no award\r\nat all for two reasons.  First, Schneider was representing himself\r\nas well as Ramos and this, the Colegio says, makes Schneider a pro\r\nse attorney-plaintiff who may not receive fees under the rule of\r\nKay v. Ehrler, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112571\"><a href=\"/opinion/112571/kay-v-ehrler/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 437-38 (1991).  In addition, the\r\nColegio argues, plaintiffs are not prevailing parties.  In any\r\nevent, the Colegio says, the fee award is simply too high for a\r\nnumber of reasons.\r\nQuestions of law regarding the award of attorney's fees\r\nare reviewed de novo.  See Williams v. Hanover Housing Auth., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"740978\"><a href=\"/opinion/740978/tashima-williams-v-the-hanover-housing-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1294</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1297 (1st Cir. 1997).  Otherwise, the award is reviewed\r\nwith deference and \"will be disturbed only for mistake of law or\r\nabuse of discretion.\"  Rodriguez-Hernandez v. Miranda-Velez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"749865\"><a href=\"/opinion/749865/75-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1228-73-empl-prac-dec-p-45317-48-fed-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">848</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 858 (1st Cir. 1998).\r\nWe affirm the award of attorney's fees plus costs and the\r\nrefund of unrefunded dues, except for those fees and costs\r\nassociated with the proceedings in the courts of the Commonwealth\r\nof Puerto Rico that took place before the filing of this federal\r\nlawsuit.  As to that limited amount of fees and costs, totaling\r\n$13,872.20, the court reverses and vacates.\r\nThe first question is whether any fees should be awarded\r\nin light of the fact that attorney Schneider was a plaintiff as\r\nwell as counsel.  Here, Ramos is a plaintiff and Schneider also\r\nrepresented Ramos; the fees incurred by plaintiffs are essentially\r\nthe same whether or not Schneider was also a plaintiff.  The\r\nColegio does not argue otherwise.  Thus, in our view, the\r\nprohibition in Kay against awarding attorney's fees to an attorney\r\npro se litigant does not apply.  See Kay, 499 U.S. at 437-38.  We\r\ndo not reach the issue of whether plaintiffs would have had\r\ndifficulty in obtaining other counsel, a matter on which the record\r\nis barren of evidence.\r\nThe second question is whether plaintiffs are prevailing\r\nparties given the partial success of their claims.  On balance, we\r\nconclude that they are prevailing parties given their success in\r\ninvalidating the payment of mandatory bar dues for ideological\r\nactivities of the bar.  See Farrar v. Hobby, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112798\"><a href=\"/opinion/112798/farrar-v-hobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 109\r\n(1992) (explaining that \"plaintiffs may be considered 'prevailing\r\nparties' for attorney's fees purposes if they succeed on any\r\nsignificant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit\r\nthe parties sought in bringing suit\") (quoting Hensley v.\r\nEckerhart, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110929\"><a href=\"/opinion/110929/hensley-v-eckerhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 433 (1983) (internal quotation marks\r\nomitted)).\r\nThe third question is whether attorney's fees may be\r\nawarded to plaintiffs for work done in the Commonwealth courts\r\nbefore the filing of the federal lawsuit.  The district court's\r\nattempts to find this situation identical to abstention by a\r\nfederal court after a federal claim has been filed and to further\r\ncharacterize the Puerto Rico proceedings \"as a necessary prelude to\r\nthe federal action\" are in error, both as a matter of law and of\r\nfact.  Schneider v. Colegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico, No. 82-\r\n1459, slip op. at 4-5, (D.P.R. Aug. 7, 1997) (emphasis added).  The\r\ncorrect test is articulated in Webb v. Board of Education, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111414\"><a href=\"/opinion/111414/webb-v-dyer-county-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">234</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1985): pre-suit fees may be awarded under 42 U.S.C.  1988\r\nonly for \"discrete\" work \"that was both useful and of a type\r\nordinarily necessary to advance the civil rights litigation to the\r\nstage it reached.\"  Id. at 243.  After all, the statutory language\r\nin  1988 permits an award of attorney's fees only \"[i]n any action\r\nor proceeding to enforce a provision of section[] . . . 1983.\"  42\r\nU.S.C.  1988(b) (emphasis added).  No federal claims were raised\r\nin the Puerto Rico proceeding and plaintiffs do not meet the Webb\r\ntest.\r\nThe next question is whether the overall fee award is\r\nexcessive.  The district court found that the claims on which the\r\nplaintiffs prevailed were \"reasonably related\" to those on which\r\nthe plaintiffs lost, and the court therefore declined to reduce the\r\noverall award on the basis of plaintiffs' limited success. \r\nAlthough the question is close, we think that the district court\r\nproperly found an adequate relationship between the successful and\r\nunsuccessful claims.  See Hensley, 461 U.S. at 440 (noting that an\r\naward of attorneys' fees based on related claims should not be\r\nreduced merely because the plaintiff did not prevail on every\r\nclaim).  As to the remainder of the defendants' objections and as\r\nto plaintiffs' cross appeal, there is no showing of mistake of law,\r\nclear error of fact, or abuse of discretion by the district court.\r\nFor these reasons, the judgment is affirmed in part,\r\nreversed in part, and the judgment is modified to reduce the\r\nattorney's fees awarded from $244,848.12 to $230,975.92 (with\r\ninterest from September 22, 1988, as per the district court's final\r\njudgment).\r\nCosts to plaintiffs.\r\n\nLIPEZ, Circuit Judge, concurring.  Although I agree with\r\nthe results arrived at by my colleagues in their per curiam\r\nopinion, I wish to explain more fully the history of this case and\r\nmy rationale for the conclusions we reach. This case is the\r\nculmination of a two decade long odyssey of litigation that has\r\nengaged thousands of hours of attorney and court time, raised\r\nimportant constitutional issues, and engendered strong feelings\r\namong the parties. Under these circumstances, I think it is\r\nappropriate to offer an explanation that hopefully will enhance an\r\nunderstanding of the issues we have addressed and avoid further\r\nlitigation.\r\n                             I.\r\n                     Litigation History\r\nThe Colegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico (\"Colegio\"),\r\nPuerto Rico's unitary bar association, instituted disciplinary\r\nproceedings in the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico in 1977 against\r\nninety-nine attorneys for failure to pay their annual dues. All but\r\ntwo, Robert E. Schneider, Jr. and Hctor R. Ramos-Daz, paid the\r\ndues. As a defense to the disciplinary proceedings, Schneider and\r\nRamos argued that the statute establishing the Colegio in its\r\nmodern form, Law Number 43, 4 L.P.R.A.  771, as amended, exceeded\r\nthe authority of the Puerto Rico legislature, and that compelled\r\nmembership in the Colegio violated their rights of free speech and\r\nassociation under the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto\r\nRico. Schneider and Ramos alleged that bar dues were being used\r\nto fund ideological activities outside the legitimate scope of a\r\nbar association. A special master was appointed by the Court to\r\nreceive evidence, and after several years of proceedings (during\r\nwhich Schneider served as counsel for himself and Ramos), the\r\nSupreme Court of Puerto Rico issued an opinion on April 5, 1982.\r\nColegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico v. Schneider, 112 D.P.R. 540, 12\r\nT.P.R. 676 (P.R. 1982) (Colegio I).\r\nThe Court ruled that Law 43 was a valid exercise of\r\nlegislative power and that compulsory membership in the Colegio was\r\nconstitutional under the Puerto Rico Constitution. Holding that it\r\nhad plenary power to shape rules governing Colegio membership, the\r\nCourt ordered the Colegio to institute a new process permitting\r\nattorneys to dissent from the use of their dues for ideological\r\nactivities, including the establishment by the next dues period of\r\nan independent review board to pass on controversies arising over\r\nactivities funded from dues. Dissenters' dues would be held in\r\nescrow until then. See 12 T.P.R. at 695. In passing on the\r\nconstitutionality of the Colegio's use of compulsory dues for\r\nideological purposes, and in shaping the remedy, the Court based\r\nits rulings on dissenters' rights arising under the Puerto Rico\r\nConstitution, not the federal Constitution. However, it stated that\r\n\"the sense of the freedom of speech clause contained in Art. II,\r\nSec. 4 of the Constitution of Puerto Rico is not narrower than that\r\ngiven by the United States Supreme Court to the First Amendment in\r\nthis context,\" id. at 692, and relied heavily on federal precedent\r\nin its discussion, see id. at 689-94. The Court gave Schneider and\r\nRamos fifteen days to pay their dues or be suspended from the\r\npractice of law. Id. at 695. Notwithstanding the promised procedure\r\nfor objecting to Colegio activities, Schneider and Ramos refused to\r\npay dues, and were disbarred on June 3, 1982.\r\nOn June 9, 1982, Schneider filed a complaint on behalf of\r\nRamos and himself in federal district court alleging that the\r\nColegio, its Foundation, the Secretaries of Justice and Treasury of\r\nPuerto Rico, and the Justices of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico\r\nviolated their civil rights pursuant to 42 U.S.C.  1983.\r\nResponding to assorted motions filed by the parties, the district\r\ncourt ruled on September 13, 1982, inter alia, that plaintiffs'\r\nchallenge to compulsory Colegio membership and to the use of dues\r\nand stamp revenues for ideological purposes stated a cause of\r\naction not barred by res judicata or collateral estoppel\r\nprinciples, that abstention was not appropriate, and that the\r\nJustices of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico were immune from\r\ndamages but not from declaratory and injunctive relief.

Two days after the district court\r\nissued its opinion, we entertained oral argument on the petitions\r\nfor mandamus (now reduced to seeking dismissal), and we modified\r\nthe court's decision sub nom.

See id. at 25. We further held that\r\nthe Justices should remain \"purely nominal parties\" with respect to\r\nchallenges to the use of stamp revenues because of their\r\nadministrative responsibilities over the stamp program. Id. at 27.\r\nThe request of the Colegio and its Foundation for mandamus relief\r\nwas denied. See id.\r\nIn December 1982, in compliance with the earlier order of\r\nthe Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, the Colegio adopted a remedial\r\nrefund procedure and informed that Court of its action. While the\r\nSupreme Court of Puerto Rico evaluated the remedy, the district\r\ncourt held an evidentiary hearing on the merits of the proposal,\r\nfollowed by full argument and briefing. In June 1983, the district\r\ncourt issued a ruling characterizing the Colegio's remedy as a\r\n\"sham, designed to forestall the adjudication of this case and the\r\nremedies to which Plaintiffs are entitled under the Laws and\r\nConstitution of the United States.\" Schneider v. Colegio de\r\nAbogados de Puerto Rico, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1458060\"><a href=\"/opinion/1458060/schneider-v-colegio-de-abogados-de-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">565</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

As noted by the district court, the proposal\r\nprovided that, in order to retain a right to object to any activity\r\nfunded by the Colegio, a general objection to funding ideological\r\nactivities had to be voiced by a dissenting member at the moment of\r\npaying dues. Members were then required to object specifically to\r\nindividual activities within thirty days after they took place, and\r\na Review Board of lawyers essentially selected by the Colegio's\r\nBoard of Governors would review objections on a standard that\r\ndefined \"ideological activities\" narrowly to mean activities\r\n\"related to partisan politics.\" Id. at 975. If an objection was\r\nsuccessful, the member who objected would receive a proportionate\r\nrefund of dues; others who objected only generally to the use of\r\ntheir fees for ideological activities would receive notice of the\r\noutcome and would have to file claims individually within thirty\r\ndays of notice in order to receive similar refunds. See id.\r\nThe court found the proposed remedy inadequate because it\r\n(1) failed entirely to address the issue of use of funds raised\r\nthrough sale of notarial stamps, (2) unconstitutionally required\r\ndissenters to disclose their disapproval of specific activities,\r\n(3) was procedurally inadequate to protect the dissenters,\r\nrequiring excessive vigilance from them, and (4) used too narrow a\r\ndefinition of \"ideological.\" Id. at 976-77. The court therefore\r\ndeclared various sections of Law 43 and related acts \"as\r\ninterpreted, enforced and applied\" to be unconstitutional. Id. at\r\n979-80. The court also enjoined all defendants (except the\r\nJustices) from taking any action against lawyers who failed to pay\r\ndues or fees to the Colegio \"until such time as the Colegio ceases\r\nto engage in ideological and/or political activism,\" from\r\ncollecting fees from the sale of forensic or notarial stamps, or\r\nfrom preventing anyone otherwise qualified from engaging in legal\r\nor notarial practice for failure to pay dues or fees or failure to\r\nbe a member of the Colegio. Id. Plaintiffs Oreste Ramos, Romany and\r\nSouss (to whom the court limited, without explanation, its award)\r\nwere awarded nominal damages of one dollar each. See id. at 980.\r\nThe court subsequently refused to stay this judgment pending\r\nappeal. See Schneider v. Colegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico, 572 F.\r\nSupp. 957, 962 (D.P.R. 1983) (Schneider IV).\r\nWe vacated this decision sub nom. Romany v.

We stated that \"the district court should have\r\nstayed its hand in this case, pending final determination of the\r\nissues turning upon Puerto Rico law, as it is clear that completion\r\nof the remedial stage of [Colegio I] 'might avoid in whole or in\r\npart the necessity for federal constitutional adjudication; or at\r\nleast materially alter the nature of the problem.'\" 742 F.2d at 40\r\n(quoting Harrison v.

We added\r\nthat \"[t]he argument for abstention is also greatly strengthened by\r\nseveral special factors\" present in the case. Id. at 42. First, an\r\naction in the Commonwealth court was already pending. See id.\r\nSecond, because the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico had inherent\r\nplenary power to shape the rules governing the bar, it could\r\ndirectly fashion relief, whereas a federal court was limited to\r\nstriking down provisions. See id. at 42-43. Finally, we cited\r\ncomity considerations: \"the expertise, cooperation and goodwill of\r\nthe Supreme Court of Puerto Rico will make much difference to the\r\nsuccess of any remedy from whatever source over the long run. This\r\nfact alone suggests the need for restraint in these\r\ncircumstances. . . . [W]hile we can appreciate the concerns of the\r\ndistrict court, we think this matter must be approached with\r\ndeliberation and full respect for the role of the judiciary of the\r\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico.\" Id. at 43. The stamp issues were also\r\nheld suitable for abstention, despite the fact that they were not\r\naddressed in Colegio I. See id. at 43-44. Finally, we recommended\r\nthat the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico implement an interim remedy\r\nto protect the interests of the dissenters: pending the resolution\r\nof both Commonwealth and federal proceedings, we suggested that 50%\r\nof dissenting members' dues should be held in an escrow account\r\nmanaged by a neutral entity. See id. at 44-45.\r\nIn the wake of our abstention ruling, the Supreme Court\r\nof Puerto Rico again held hearings to consider a remedy. In late\r\n1984, the Court issued an order providing for the interim remedy we\r\nsuggested, and then reinstated Schneider and Ramos to the practice\r\nof law in light of their consent to that remedy. After hearings,\r\nthe Court issued an opinion outlining a permanent remedy. See\r\nColegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico v. Schneider, 117 D.P.R. 504, 17\r\nT.P.R. 610 (P.R. 1986) (Colegio II). The opinion established a list\r\nof non-objectionable activities (such as maintaining professional\r\nand ethical standards, advocating the rights and immunities of\r\nlawyers, establishing legal aid programs, and so forth), without\r\noffering a definition of \"objectionable\" activities. 17 T.P.R. at\r\n630-31. It then provided that dissenting attorneys could lodge a\r\ngeneral objection to funding all \"objectionable\" activities, either\r\nat the time of paying annual dues or later during the year. Id. at\r\n633. A portion of dissenters' dues (15% for those objecting upon\r\npayment; proportionately less for mid-year dissenters) would be\r\nreserved in a general escrow account. See id. at 634. Any member of\r\nthe Colegio could raise objections to specific activities before a\r\nreview panel of retired Commonwealth judges, reviewable by the\r\nSupreme Court of Puerto Rico. If the review panel found the\r\nactivity to be objectionable, a proportionate dues refund would be\r\npaid to the objector and to all those who lodged a general\r\nobjection. See id. at 632-35. The costs and expenses of the use of\r\nColegio facilities by third parties engaged in objectionable\r\nactivities would be \"subject to this remedy\" if those parties did\r\nnot cover those costs and expenses. Id. at 631. Proceeds from the\r\nsale of notarial and bar stamps were not to be used for\r\nobjectionable activities. See id. at 636.\r\nThe Colegio then moved to dismiss the federal action as\r\nres judicata. The district court (per Torruella, by then a Circuit\r\nJudge, sitting by designation) rejected this argument, see\r\nSchneider v.

Puerto Rico's res\r\njudicata rules require that \"there be the most perfect identity\r\nbetween the things, causes, and persons of the litigants, and their\r\ncapacity as such.\" 31 L.P.R.A.  3343 (quoted in Schneider VI, 670\r\nF. Supp. at 1104). The court found that the federal case concerned\r\nongoing obligations to support the Colegio, whereas the\r\nCommonwealth case concerned only past obligations not met, thus\r\ndisrupting the required identity. Collateral estoppel was\r\ninapplicable because the federal claims were not raised in the\r\nCommonwealth proceedings. Schneider VI, 670 F. Supp. at 1104.\r\nReaching the merits once again in a subsequent hearing,\r\nthe district court found that the 1986 rule failed to adequately\r\nprotect dissenters' rights. See Schneider v.

The rule stated that activities within \"the Bar\r\nAssociation's purposes and ends which are germane thereto shall not\r\nbe considered objectionable,\" and then stated that the Colegio's\r\n\"functions and purposes\" are \"[t]o exercise . . . powers conferred\r\nby law or by the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico and any other\r\nincidental powers necessary or convenient for the ends of its\r\ncreation and which are not in disagreement with the purpose and the\r\nlaw which creates the Bar Association.\" Id. at 687.\r\nMost importantly, the parties had stipulated for this\r\nproceeding that objectionable Colegio activities, similar to those\r\nundertaken prior to 1983, had continued. See id. at 678. This\r\nstipulation induced the court to implement substantial remedial\r\nmeasures. The court found the 15% escrow reserve percentage to be\r\narbitrary, and held that the Colegio had to base the escrow\r\npercentage on each year's projected budget, including a buffer\r\nallowing for error in the budget projections. See id. at 687-88.\r\nThe court also found unacceptable the requirement that dissenters\r\nobject to specific activities, and the fact that those objections\r\nwould be made public. See id. at 684, 689. The court allowed 60\r\ndays for the Commonwealth to institute a remedial rule. See id. at\r\n691. Pending the adoption of such a rule, the defendants could not\r\ncompel payment of dues or fees, use of stamps, or membership in\r\nthe Colegio. See id. Finally, the court awarded nominal damages of\r\none dollar to each of the five plaintiffs. See id. at 692.\r\nOn appeal from the district court's ruling, we stayed the\r\ninjunction prohibiting mandatory dues for six months \"so that the\r\nColegio may remain integrated while it attempts to correct its\r\nconstitutional defects.\"  See Schneider v.

They also\r\nclaim the court erred in its order mandating a refund of dues to\r\nplaintiffs. In their cross-appeal, Schneider and Ramos claim the\r\ncourt erred in failing to: (1) order a more extensive refund of\r\ndues; (2) address a seeming inconsistency in the rules governing\r\nwho may object to specific Colegio activities; (3) adequately\r\nsanction the Colegio for its failure to notice plaintiffs of\r\nmotions before the court and for its withdrawal of funds from the\r\nescrow account; (4) award fees to attorney Hctor Mrquez for his\r\nrepresentation of several other plaintiffs in this litigation; and\r\n(5) hold the Justices of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico liable\r\nfor attorney's fees.\r\n\n                            II.\r\n                         The Appeal\r\nA.

The Court stated that \"it seems likely that Congress\r\ncontemplated an attorney-client relationship as the predicate for\r\nan award under  1988,\" id. at 436, and reasoned that Congress\r\nwished to encourage such an agency relationship so that parties\r\nwould benefit from the detached objectivity of a disinterested\r\nadvocate. See id. at 435-37.\r\nThis case is not Kay because Schneider was involved in an\r\nattorney-client relationship throughout this litigation,\r\nrepresenting both himself and Hctor R. Ramos-Daz. The attorney-\r\nclient relationship imposed an ethical obligation on Schneider to\r\nconsider the interests of his client at all times and exercise his\r\nbest professional judgment, thus satisfying the concerns\r\nunderlying Kay's requirement of an attorney-client relationship.\r\nNevertheless, the Colegio argues that we should extend Kay to\r\nsituations where an attorney-client relationship exists, but the\r\nattorney also has a personal interest in the outcome of the case.\r\nOn this theory, the Colegio asserts that Ramos (and Schneider as\r\nwell) should have sought counsel who was fully disinterested in the\r\noutcome of the case if they wished to avail themselves of\r\nattorney's fees under  1988.\r\nI disagree. If Ramos had retained an attorney admitted in\r\nPuerto Rico   that is, a member of the Colegio   to represent him,\r\nit could hardly be said that he had retained objective counsel. Any\r\nrelief achieved by the litigation would have affected the rights\r\nand obligations of such an attorney in relation to the Colegio,\r\njust as it would those of his client Ramos; therefore, such an\r\nattorney's stake in the outcome of the matter would resemble that\r\nof a party. Moreover, such an attorney would have complied with the\r\nvery rules that Ramos wished to challenge, and would thereby have\r\ntaken a position directly contrary to that of his client.\r\nAlthough Ramos could have sought counsel admitted only\r\noutside the jurisdiction, he would have faced many practical\r\ndifficulties. During most of the pendency of this case, an attorney\r\nwho was not a member of the Colegio could only practice in the\r\nCommonwealth through courtesy of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court.\r\nPrior to July 1, 1989, an attorney could not be admitted to\r\npractice before the federal district court for the District of\r\nPuerto Rico without being \"currently in good standing as an\r\nattorney admitted to practice before the courts of the Commonwealth\r\nof Puerto Rico.\" P.R. U.S. Dist. L.R. 201 (1987). Therefore, any\r\nattorney from outside the jurisdiction would have had to obtain\r\ncourtesy admission in the Commonwealth Court in order to argue even\r\nthe federal case (at least prior to July 1, 1989). In addition,\r\nRamos would have had to find an attorney from outside of Puerto\r\nRico proficient in Spanish and competent to deal with issues of\r\nCommonwealth constitutional law to function effectively in the\r\nCommonwealth Court proceedings.\r\nI believe the challenge of finding \"independent\" counsel\r\nwith fully objective judgment capable of competently handling the\r\nentirety of the case, and gaining his or her admission to practice\r\nbefore the Commonwealth and federal courts, would constitute an\r\nunreasonable burden on Ramos in the pursuit of his legal claims. If\r\n\"Congress was interested in ensuring the effective prosecution of\r\nmeritorious claims\" when it enacted  1988, as the Supreme Court\r\nstated in Kay, 499 U.S. at 437, surely it did not envision\r\nrequiring plaintiffs in the position of Ramos to seek disinterested\r\ncounsel under circumstances that would make such a requirement\r\nantithetical to the effective prosecution of their claim. I\r\ntherefore conclude that Schneider's party status, on the unusual\r\nfacts of this case, does not preclude an award of attorney's fees.\r\n\nB. Schneider's and Ramos' status as prevailing parties under 42\r\nU.S.C.  1988\r\nThe Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 90\r\nStat. 2641, as amended, 42 U.S.C.  1988(b), provides that:\r\n  In any action or proceeding to enforce a\r\nprovision of section[] . . . 1983 . . . of\r\nthis title, . . . the court, in its\r\ndiscretion, may allow the prevailing party,\r\nother than the United States, a reasonable\r\nattorney's fee as part of the costs . . . .\r\nThe Colegio and Secretaries argue that the relief obtained by\r\nplaintiffs consisted mainly of an award of nominal damages, which\r\n\"did not materially alter the relationship between the plaintiffs\r\nand the Colegio and the Secretaries,\" and left the outcome of the\r\nlitigation as a whole \"at most a minimal success\" for plaintiffs.\r\nThe Colegio and Secretaries contend that the primary \"relief sought\r\nin this case was clearly to convert the Colegio into a voluntary\r\nassociation, and shield the plaintiffs from the risk of disbarment\r\nfor their continued refusal to pay dues to the Colegio.\" This\r\nargument conflates an argument for a reduction in the size of the\r\naward due to \"limited success\" (which I consider in section C(1),\r\nbelow) with an argument that the plaintiffs here are not entitled\r\nto any fees award since they do not qualify as \"prevailing\r\nparties.\"\r\nPlaintiffs may be considered prevailing parties \"if they\r\nsucceed on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some\r\nof the benefit the parties sought in bringing suit.\" Texas State\r\nTeachers Assoc. v.

The Supreme Court has stated that a plaintiff is a\r\nprevailing party under  1988 \"when actual relief on the merits of\r\nhis claim materially alters the legal relationship between the\r\nparties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that\r\ndirectly benefits the plaintiff,\" and that \"[a] judgment for\r\ndamages in any amount, whether compensatory or nominal, modifies\r\nthe defendant's behavior by forcing the defendant to pay an amount\r\nof money he otherwise would not pay.\" Farrar v.

Since Schneider and Ramos each received\r\none dollar in nominal damages, they are \"prevailing parties\" who\r\n\"crossed the threshold to a fee award of some kind.\" Garland, 489\r\nU.S. at 792.\r\n\nC. The size of the fee award\r\n1. Degree of success\r\nWhile \"the degree of a plaintiff's success in relation to\r\nthe other goals of the lawsuit\" is not relevant to his \"eligibility\r\nfor a fee award,\" it is \"a factor critical to the determination of\r\nthe size of a reasonable fee.\" Garland, 489 U.S. at 790. The\r\nColegio contends that the overall fee award should have been\r\nreduced because Schneider and Ramos achieved limited success when\r\nthe litigation is viewed as a whole, and, in particular, plaintiffs\r\nfailed to achieve the goal \"closest to [their] heart[s],\"\r\noverturning mandatory membership. Evaluating the extent of success\r\nfor purposes of fees award reduction is assigned to the trial\r\ncourt's discretion and our review is appropriately deferential. See\r\nHensley, 461 U.S. at 437 (\"court necessarily has discretion\" in\r\nmaking equitable judgment as to fees award reduction for limited\r\nsuccess).\r\nThe Supreme Court has stated that \"'the most critical\r\nfactor' in determining the reasonableness of a fee award 'is the\r\ndegree of success obtained.'\" Farrar, 506 U.S. at 114 (quoting\r\nHensley, 461 U.S. at 436). Where a plaintiff recovers \"only nominal\r\ndamages . . . the only reasonable fee is usually no fee at all.\"\r\nFarrar, 506 U.S. at 115. However, this principle applies only\r\n\"'[w]here recovery of private damages is the purpose of civil\r\nrights litigation.'\" Id. at 114 (quoting Riverside v. Rivera, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111730\"><a href=\"/opinion/111730/riverside-v-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">561</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 585 (1986) (Powell, J., concurring)). Damages were never\r\na significant issue to the plaintiffs in this litigation. Rather,\r\nSchneider and Ramos sought and achieved far more than an award of\r\nindividual money damages in this case. They sought primarily to\r\nvindicate their constitutional rights through injunctive relief.\r\nAlthough compulsory Colegio membership was ultimately held to be\r\nconstitutional, this holding was subject to a significant\r\nqualification: the Colegio would no longer be allowed to use dues\r\nand stamp proceeds to support ideological purposes outside of the\r\ncore purposes of a bar association, and it was forced to institute\r\nprocedures to refund to dissenting attorneys dues that were\r\nearmarked for such ideological purposes. As the district court put\r\nit: \"[T]he success of plaintiffs in winning an alteration of the\r\nmethod by which dues were assessed and collected by the Colegio was\r\na victory of major proportions for the constitutional rights of\r\nColegio members. . . . Its significance is not diminished by the\r\nfact that there were a good number of issues on which plaintiffs\r\ndid not prevail.\" Schneider X, slip op. at 1.\r\nThe Supreme Court has stated that \"[w]here a lawsuit\r\nconsists of related claims, a plaintiff who has won substantial\r\nrelief should not have his attorney's fee reduced simply because\r\nthe district court did not adopt each contention raised.\" Hensley,\r\n461 U.S. at 440. Claims are related where they \"involve a common\r\ncore of facts or [are] based on related legal theories,\" or where\r\ncounsel's time is \"devoted generally to the litigation as a whole,\r\nmaking it difficult to divide the hours expended on a claim-by-\r\nclaim basis.\"  Id. at 435; see also Coutin v. Young &amp; Rubicam\r\nPuerto Rico, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"746216\"><a href=\"/opinion/746216/74-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1463-72-empl-prac-dec-p-45260-denise/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">331</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 339 (1st Cir. 1997) (claims\r\nunrelated where they \"rest on different facts and legal theories\"\r\n(emphasis added)). Here the district court specifically found that\r\n\"[t]hose claims in which plaintiffs failed to prevail were\r\nreasonably related to the claim on which they succeeded. The\r\n[failed] claims were not distinct in all respects\" and therefore\r\nhours expended pursuing them were properly considered in assessing\r\nfees. Schneider IX, 947 F. Supp. at 42 (citing Hensley, 461 U.S. at\r\n440).\r\nThe Colegio and Secretaries claim the district court\r\nabused its discretion in reaching this conclusion. However, the\r\nunsuccessful efforts of Schneider and Ramos to overturn mandatory\r\nmembership and stamp use were closely related to their successful\r\nefforts to establish a dues reduction procedure and limits on the\r\nColegio's use of stamp proceeds. Both remedies pursued by\r\nplaintiffs (voluntary membership/stamp use and dues\r\nreduction/limits on stamp revenue use) were means to the same end:\r\nvindicating the constitutional rights of dissenters who did not\r\nwish to be forced to subsidize the Colegio's ideological\r\nactivities. Plaintiffs' based their pursuit of both alternate\r\nremedies on an identical \"core of facts\" documenting the Colegio's\r\nideological activities, and on \"related legal theories\" regarding\r\nthe underlying constitutional right in question; either identity\r\nwould be sufficient to establish the relatedness of the remedial\r\nclaims under the disjunctive standard of Hensley and Coutin, above.\r\nMoreover, it would be nearly impossible to \"divide the hours\r\nexpended on a claim-by-claim basis,\" Hensley, 461 U.S. at 435, even\r\nif the district court, in the exercise of its discretion, had\r\ndetermined that it was equitable to do so. I therefore conclude\r\nthat the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining\r\nto reduce the attorney's fees award because Schneider and Ramos did\r\nnot prevail on every claim they raised or achieve all the relief\r\nthey requested.\r\n\n2. The Commonwealth Court proceedings\r\nUnder certain conditions, federal courts have held that\r\nhours expended in state court proceedings are compensable under\r\n1988. We have, for example, held that hours expended in state\r\ncourt proceedings are compensable where those state proceedings\r\nwere initiated and pursued solely because of a federal court's\r\nPullman abstention subsequent to the initial filing of a federal\r\nclaim in the federal forum.

Section 1983 was part of the litigation by then, and\r\nfederal court abstention made the prosecution of the Commonwealth\r\nproceedings necessary to the advancement of the federal proceeding.\r\nThe Colegio argues that hours spent in the disciplinary\r\nproceeding in the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico from 1977 to\r\nplaintiff's 1982 disbarment, prior to the filing of the federal\r\nclaim, should not be compensable under  1988 since the\r\ndisciplinary proceeding preceded the filing of the federal claim\r\nbut was not a legally necessary precursor to the filing of that\r\nclaim. On this line of argument, Schneider and Ramos should have\r\nraised their federal constitutional defenses to the disbarment\r\nproceedings immediately (instead of reserving them) and should then\r\nhave attempted to remove the case to federal court. Better yet,\r\naccording to the logic of the Colegio, they might have preempted\r\nthe disbarment action by filing a complaint seeking declaratory\r\nrelief in federal court under  1983, instead of simply letting\r\ntheir dues payments lapse and waiting for the Colegio to commence\r\ndisciplinary proceedings in the Commonwealth Court. However, they\r\nchose to allow the disciplinary proceedings to commence and then\r\nintentionally reserved their federal ( 1983) defenses. The Colegio\r\nclaims that this course of conduct left the 1977-1982 disciplinary\r\nproceedings essentially unrelated to the  1983 action that\r\neventually followed, and thus any hours expended on the\r\ndisciplinary proceedings should not be compensable under  1988.\r\nIn ordering more proceedings on the subject of attorney's\r\nfees in its October 1996 ruling, the district court stated that\r\n\"[a]bsent a showing that these hours[ claimed for work in\r\nCommonwealth Court proceedings], or any part of them, were either\r\ndone for the benefit of this federal litigation or necessary to\r\nmaintain or advance this litigation, or otherwise connected to or\r\nrequired by this litigation, such work is not covered by 42 U.S.C.\r\n1988.\" Schneider IX, 947 F.

Ultimately, however, the court\r\njustified its actual fees award not on Webb but rather on its\r\nconclusion that the Commonwealth Court proceedings of 1977-1982\r\nwould have been part of any federal  1983 action because of the\r\ninevitability of Pullman abstention on the facts of this case.\r\nSpecifically, the district court stated that \"[c]lose scrutiny has\r\nbeen given to plaintiffs' claim for attorney[']s fees incurred in\r\nthe Commonwealth court proceedings from November 1977 . . . to June\r\n9, 1982 [the date of filing the federal action].\" Schneider X, slip\r\nop. at 3. Noting that this litigation did not have the \"'neat'\r\nhistory of an action in which the federal court immediately\r\nabstained in order to allow a state action to proceed,\" the court\r\nnevertheless concluded that \"the conduct and conclusion of the\r\nCommonwealth proceeding was eventually recognized as a necessary\r\nprerequisite and adjunct to the federal action.\" Id. at 4.\r\nI cannot agree with this rationale, grounded as it is on\r\nthe inevitability of the 1977-1982 Commonwealth proceedings even if\r\nSchneider and Ramos had filed their federal claims in federal court\r\nprior to the commencement of the disciplinary proceedings in 1977.\r\nPullman abstention is a discretionary practice of federal courts,\r\npremised on both prudential and federalism/comity concerns, see\r\nPullman, 312 U.S. at 500-01, and it is therefore impossible to say\r\nwith certainty that a federal court would have ordered abstention\r\non a given set of facts.

Schneider and Ramos\r\ndid not move to cut short the state proceedings by instituting a\r\nseparate  1983 action in district court and then moving to halt\r\nthe Puerto Rico Supreme Court proceedings pending action in the\r\nfederal court (as did the employee-plaintiffs in Stathos), nor did\r\nthey raise federal defenses in the Commonwealth proceedings and\r\nseek removal to the district court. Here, unlike the employees in\r\nStathos, Schneider and Ramos were not at risk of losing their\r\nclaims through collateral estoppel or res judicata (issue or claim\r\npreclusion, respectively) predicated on the Puerto Rico Supreme\r\nCourt's resolution of the issues before it.

On this record, the\r\nDistrict Court correctly held that all of the administrative work\r\nwas not compensable.\" Id. at 243 (emphasis added). \"The petitioner\r\nmade no suggestion below that any discrete portion of the work\r\nproduct from the administrative proceedings was work that was both\r\nuseful and of a type ordinarily necessary to advance\" the  1983\r\nclaim. Id. (emphasis added). Whether or not facts like those in\r\nWebb might ordinarily support a partial fee award, the \"all-or-\r\nnothing\" nature of the plaintiff's fee claims in Webb precluded\r\nsuch a result.\r\nIn the case before us, we have no indication that\r\nSchneider and Ramos made claims in any way distinguishable from\r\nthose made by Webb. Webb's attorney's fees claims in the district\r\ncourt contained an \"itemized description of the time spent\" in the\r\nancillary administrative proceedings. Id. at 238. Schneider's and\r\nRamos' application did the same, detailing specific tasks and hours\r\nspent thereon in the disciplinary proceedings. However, in Webb\r\nthis approach was found to be insufficient, given that Webb\r\npresented only evidence \"that the administrative work in its\r\nentirety was 'useful' and 'necessary' to the outcome of the\r\nlitigation.\" Id. at 257 (Brennan, J., dissenting in part and\r\nconcurring in part) (emphasis added). Schneider and Ramos argued\r\nbelow that the \"total\" hours expended in the 1977-1982 disciplinary\r\nproceedings were compensable, on the theory that \"litigation in the\r\nPuerto Rico Supreme Court of the 1977 case Colegio v. Schneider et\r\nal[.,] was a necessary and indispensable condition precedent to and\r\npart of this case.\" Motion for Attorneys Fees, Dkt. 257 (Sep. 28,\r\n1988), at 6. Later, after the Schneider IX decision, they argued\r\nthat a \"prior ruling by the highest State [sic] Court on the\r\nConstitutionality of said laws under the Constitution of the\r\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico was a prerequisite to the federal\r\nclaim, irrespective of whether said ruling was prior to or after\r\nthe institution of the suit in the Federal [sic] Court [sic]\r\nchallenging the constitutionality of said laws under the U.S.\r\nConstitution.\" Motion in Compliance with October 30, 1996 Order,\r\nDkt. 382 (Feb. 7, 1997), at 3. Both statements present all-or-\r\nnothing claims similar to those rejected in Webb. The statements\r\nalso mirror the inevitability theory put forward by the district\r\ncourt, a theory I have rejected, above. In fact, Schneider and\r\nRamos did not articulate below (or on appeal) any viable theory for\r\nwhy some \"discrete portion\" of the hours spent in the disciplinary\r\nproceedings should be compensable as \"useful and . . . ordinarily\r\nnecessary\" under Webb.\r\nI therefore concur in the conclusion that we must reject\r\nthe claim of Schneider and Ramos for attorney's fees for hours\r\nspent prior to June 3, 1982 on Commonwealth Court proceedings, and\r\nmust adjust the district court's award, eliminating those amounts\r\nowing to hours expended prior to June 3, 1982 on Commonwealth Court\r\nproceedings. In total these hours accounted for $13,872.20 of the\r\ndistrict court's fees award, and this deduction results in a\r\nreduced award of $230,975.92, plus costs and with interest from\r\nSeptember 22, 1988 as per the district court's order.\r\n\n3. Miscellaneous claims for adjusting the fee award\r\nThe Colegio contends that the court should have adjusted\r\nthe fee award downwards for work on losing claims advanced by\r\nplaintiffs. I have already considered and rejected these \"partial\r\nsuccess\" fee reduction arguments in my discussion of the degree of\r\nsuccess issue, above. The Colegio also objects to the court's\r\nfailure to reduce the fee award for hours spent on motions by\r\nplaintiffs that were dismissed, for allegedly excessive hours\r\nclaimed for individual tasks, and for clerical tasks allegedly\r\ninappropriately performed by lawyers. The district court gave these\r\nclaims careful consideration in rejecting the majority of them,\r\nsee Schneider X, slip op. at 5-6, and we have properly refrained\r\nfrom disturbing its exercise of discretion here.\r\nCiting no authority, see Appellant's Br. at 34-37, the\r\nColegio and Secretaries challenge the district court's refusal to\r\ndiscount the fees award for time spent by plaintiffs pursuing\r\nunsuccessful or partially successful appeals to this court. The\r\nSchneider II proceeding, for instance, resulted in the grant of a\r\nwrit of mandamus to the defendant/petitioner Justices, reducing\r\nthem to nominal parties; our decision in the Schneider V appeal\r\nvacated the district court's decision in favor of plaintiffs and\r\nordered abstention; and our Schneider VIII decision temporarily\r\nstayed an injunction granting relief sought by plaintiffs. However,\r\n\"the prevalent approach\" to determining whether a plaintiff is a\r\nprevailing party \"on appeal[] is to inquire whether the plaintiff\r\nhas prevailed in the litigation as a whole.\" John E.

Refund of dues\r\n1. Background\r\nThe district court's final judgment in this matter,\r\nSchneider XI at 1-2, included an order resolving dissenters' claims\r\nto a refund of dues amounts corresponding to ideological activities\r\nof the Colegio during years prior to the institution of the final\r\ndues reduction procedure outlined in the 1993 rules promulgated by\r\nthe Supreme Court of Puerto Rico. Before responding to the parties'\r\nobjections to the district court's dues refund order, I must review\r\nthe history of that court's orders concerning dues payments during\r\nthe pendency of this case, including the dues payments that were\r\nactually made by plaintiffs (relying primarily on the briefs on\r\nappeal and cross-appeal for much of the payment data, which is\r\nabsent from the record).\r\nSchneider ceased to pay dues in 1974, Ramos in 1976. See\r\nSchneider I, 546 F. Supp. at 1255. Our 1984 abstention decision\r\nstated that a pure refund remedy was inadequate (a similar plan\r\nhaving been rejected by the Supreme Court in Ellis v. Brotherhood\r\nof Railway, Airline &amp; Steamship Clerks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111161\"><a href=\"/opinion/111161/ellis-v-railway-clerks/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 441-44, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111161\"><a href=\"/opinion/111161/ellis-v-railway-clerks/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.

See Schneider V, 742 F.2d at 44. We suggested that a\r\nreasonable interim remedy would allow dissenters to pay 50% of dues\r\ninto escrow. See id. at 44-45. This recommended interim remedy was\r\napproved on November 13, 1984 by the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico,\r\nwhich allowed readmission of dissenters upon compliance; with\r\nrespect to Schneider and Ramos, the Court allowed them to pay 50%\r\nof their dues into escrow for all dues years for which they had\r\nvoiced objection to Colegio ideological activities. See Dkt. 328,\r\nExh. A (Nov. 13, 1984 order of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico).\r\nThe parties stipulated terms for the escrow account,\r\nincluding requirements that the name of the bank holding the\r\naccount and the account number be disclosed to dissenters, and that\r\nthe Supreme Court of Puerto Rico would order the Colegio \"not to\r\nwithdraw any amount of money from this [Escrow] Account until the\r\nclaims in dispute have been finally resolved by the Supreme Court\r\nof Puerto Rico, and, if it were necessary, by the federal courts.\"\r\nBl. Br. (cross appeal) at 7-8 (quoting Dkt. 328, Exh. B, at 2). The\r\nstipulation was signed by the parties on Jan. 23, 1985, and on Jan.\r\n31, 1985, Schneider and Ramos paid the Colegio 50% of their dues\r\ncorresponding to years 1978-1985 inclusive, and an equal amount\r\ninto the escrow account. At the same time, Schneider paid his full\r\ndues for years 1974-1977 directly to the Colegio as well, see Red\r\nBr. (cross appeal) at 21, and Ramos similarly paid full dues for\r\n1976-1977 directly to the Colegio, see Red Br. (cross appeal) at\r\n22; neither plaintiff paid any amount into escrow for those dues\r\nyears. In 1986 Schneider and Ramos paid appropriate amounts to the\r\nColegio and the escrow account for their 1986 dues. See Red Br.\r\n(cross appeal) at 22. The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico's 1986\r\nremedy provided that 15% of dues could be paid to escrow for dues\r\nyears from 1987 onwards. See Colegio II, 17 T.P.R. at 634. Nothing\r\nin the briefs or record on appeal indicates whether or not\r\nSchneider or Ramos paid any dues for 1987 or 1988.\r\nIn 1988 the district court enjoined the Colegio from\r\nmandating bar membership or dues payments, see Schneider VII, 682\r\nF. Supp. at 691; after a grace period, this injunction appears to\r\nhave gone into effect on May 31, 1988 (although the record is far\r\nfrom clear; the injunction may have been stayed pending appeal). We\r\nsuspended effectiveness of the injunction for 6 months in 1990, but\r\nallowed 100% of dues to be escrowed during this stay. See Schneider\r\nVIII, 917 F.2d at 636. After the 6 months expired, petitions for\r\ncertiorari were filed by all parties, and the district court\r\nextended our stay pending resolution of these certiorari petitions.\r\nThe Supreme Court denied certiorari in January 1992. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">1029</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1992). In June 1992, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico issued\r\nnew rules governing dues that allowed dissenters to pay a\r\nproportionately lower dues amount based on the Colegio's budget for\r\nunobjectionable activities. Schneider admits not making dues\r\npayments for the dues year 1989 and every year afterwards. See Red\r\nBr. at 12. As for Ramos, the Colegio indicates that he paid dues\r\nfrom 1989 to 1992 and paid the full, undiscounted amount to the\r\nColegio for 1993, see Red Br. (cross appeal) at 21; there is no\r\nindication of whether Ramos paid some or all of his dues for 1989-\r\n1992 into the escrow account.\r\nThe 1992 rules promulgated by the Supreme Court of Puerto\r\nRico established a Review Board to deal with disputes over\r\ncategorization of expenses. On May 24, 1995, the Colegio appeared\r\nbefore the Board to present its dues refund proposal for dues years\r\n1985-1992. On August 29, 1995, the Review Board issued a decision\r\ndetermining amounts for refund to plaintiffs in conformity with the\r\nColegio's proposal. For dues years 1989-1992, the amount to be\r\nrefunded was determined on the basis of an independent accounting\r\nfor that portion of the Colegio budget spent on ideological\r\nactivities; for other years where no accounting was done, the\r\ntotal portion of dues (50% for 1985-1986 and 15% for 1987-1988)\r\npaid into escrow was ordered refunded; in each case, refunds were\r\nto include interest. Notwithstanding the Review Board's\r\npronouncement, further proceedings in the district court took place\r\nin order to resolve the refund issue. After reviewing the\r\ncontentions of both parties, the court determined that \"the fairest\r\nway to resolve\" the refund issue was to avoid determining exactly\r\nwhat percentage of the Colegio budget for past years was\r\nattributable to ideological activities, Schneider IX, 947 F. Supp.\r\nat 42, and ultimately ordered that all moneys that had been paid\r\ninto escrow but were as yet unrefunded should be returned to\r\nplaintiffs, with interest. See Schneider XI at 1-2.\r\n\n2. The Colegio's objection to the dues refund order\r\nThe Colegio argues that the district court's \"Memorandum,\r\nOpinion and Order\" of Oct. 30, 1996, Schneider IX, 947 F. Supp. at\r\n42, \"augments\" the amount of dues to be refunded to plaintiffs,\r\nover and above the limited refunds of escrowed dues approved by the\r\nReview Board in 1995. The district court's final judgment ordered\r\nthe refund of all dues deposited in escrow, whereas the Review\r\nBoard approved only a partial refund for the years 1989-1992,\r\nfollowing the results of its independent accounting. For example,\r\nfor years 1990-1992, dissenters were allowed to pay 100% of their\r\ndues into escrow, all of which would be refundable to dissenters\r\nunder the district court's refund plan, whereas the Review Board\r\ndetermined that only a small portion of those payments would be\r\nrefunded based on its accounting of ideological-activity related\r\nexpenses for those years. However, in developing its argument, the\r\nColegio does not claim that this \"augmentation\" of the refund is\r\nsubstantively unfair (with one minor exception addressed below),\r\nbut only claims that the Review Board's determination of the issue\r\nshould have had a preclusive effect on the district court. I find\r\nnothing about the Review Board proceedings and refund order that\r\nindicates its conclusions should be binding on the parties to the\r\nfederal case. The refund issue had been a part of the federal case\r\nfor many years, see, e.g., Schneider VII, 682 F. Supp. at 675, it\r\nremained so, and the district court was well within its power in\r\nchoosing to resolve it as it did.\r\nThe Colegio also seems to imply that the 1996 Opinion\r\nunfairly \"augments\" the dues refund by ordering the Colegio to pay\r\nSchneider a refund (in the amount of 50% of compulsory dues) for\r\nyears in which Schneider did not in fact pay any dues. The October\r\n1996 order states: \"To the extent that, in any year of the ...\r\nperiod [during which dues were partially escrowed], the refund by\r\nthe Colegio to plaintiffs was less than 50% of the compulsory dues,\r\nthe difference shall be paid to plaintiffs with interest from the\r\nend of that membership year.\" Schneider IX, 947 F. Supp. at 42.\r\nThis language might be read to mean that, had no dues been paid\r\ninto escrow by a plaintiff, and thus no dues refunded, the Colegio\r\nwould nonetheless owe said plaintiff the difference between the\r\namount refunded (zero) and half the compulsory dues, resulting in\r\na windfall for the plaintiff. However, the court's final order of\r\nMarch 23, 1998 states its mandate somewhat differently:\r\n  3. That, for the years in which plaintiffs and\r\nother lawyers, following the commencement of\r\nthis action up to the promulgation of the\r\nrules referred to above, paid 50% or another\r\nportion of their annual compulsory dues into\r\nan escrow account and said amounts have not\r\nbeen refunded, then the Colegio shall refund\r\nthe unrefunded amounts together with interest\r\non those amounts from the end of the\r\nmembership year for which they were deposited.\r\n\nSchneider XI at 1-2 (D. Puerto Rico March 23, 1998). This provision\r\nclearly covers only \"paid\" and \"unrefunded\" amounts, which by\r\ndefinition could not include amounts never paid by plaintiffs or\r\namounts already refunded under the plan approved by the Colegio's\r\nBoard of Review, if any. To the extent that any language in the\r\nearlier opinion of the court could be interpreted to the contrary,\r\nit is superseded by the text of this final order.\r\n                            III.\r\n                      The Cross-Appeal\r\nA. The adequacy of the dues refund\r\nOn cross-appeal Schneider and Ramos assert that the dues\r\nrefund order did not go far enough, and should have included an\r\norder for dues refunds for the ten years prior to the court's\r\nopinion and findings of fact in Schneider v. Colegio, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1458060\"><a href=\"/opinion/1458060/schneider-v-colegio-de-abogados-de-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">565</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">963</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.P.R. 1983). The district court's findings of fact are\r\ndetailed in the appendix to its opinion entitled \"Supplementary\r\nFindings and Conclusions\":\r\n  30. The official positions, activities and\r\nactions of the Colegio over the past ten years\r\nevidence a pattern of conduct by the Colegio\r\nto engage in, and to use the facilities,\r\npersonnel and resources of the Colegio for\r\nideological or political activity without\r\nrestriction or limitation in the name and\r\nrepresentation of all the members of the\r\nColegio, including Plaintiffs.\r\n\nSchneider III, 565 F. Supp. at 982-83 (emphasis added). That\r\nopinion was vacated on appeal, but the district court later\r\nregarded its earlier factual findings as either the law of the case\r\n(since not appealed from) or incorporated into the later opinion.\r\nSee, e.g., Schneider VII, 682 F. Supp. at 678-79. Schneider and\r\nRamos claim the court's 1998 order should have mandated further\r\nrefunds to cover the Colegio's use of dues for ideological\r\nactivities during the ten year period described in the court's 1983\r\nfinding. This period includes years for which no portion of dues\r\nwas paid into the escrow account; such amounts would not be covered\r\nby the court's 1998 refund order.\r\nSchneider and Ramos did not properly preserve this issue\r\nfor appeal. The district court first addressed the refund issue in\r\nits October 30, 1996 order, stating that plaintiffs claimed \"the\r\nColegio has not refunded to them the amount of dues properly\r\nattributable to non-core activities during the course of this\r\nlitigation.\" Schneider IX, 947 F. Supp. at 42. The court\r\nsubsequently requested that the parties submit proposed final\r\norders. Plaintiffs' proposed order provided only for refunds of\r\ndues paid into the escrow account \"during the period from June 9,\r\n1982 up to February 23, 1993.\" Dkt. 389, Dec. 5, 1997, Exhibit A,\r\nat 12. Schneider and Ramos thereby waived the issue of refunds of\r\ndues paid during any earlier period, and we have correctly refused\r\nto entertain their request to exhume it on appeal.

Construction of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico's rules\r\ngoverning the right to object to unbudgeted activities of the\r\nColegio\r\nThe district court issued an order, Dkt. 313, Nov. 19,\r\n1992, which mandated that the parties petition the Supreme Court of\r\nPuerto Rico to consider certain amendments to that Court's 1992\r\nrules governing membership in the Colegio and the Colegio's use of\r\ndues for ideological activities. The controversy at hand concerns\r\nlanguage in Rule 6(A), reproduced in context below (\"second-\r\ncategory activities\" are those activities not related to the core\r\npurposes of a bar association, or having \"ideological overtones\"):\r\n  Rule 5 Dues \r\n    (A) Bar members who choose to finance\r\nall Bar Association activities shall pay the\r\nannual dues fixed by the General Assembly in\r\naccordance with the law. \r\n    (B) Computation of annual dues for bar\r\nmembers who choose not to finance\r\nsecond-category activities shall be based on\r\nthe classification of the activities included\r\nin the Rule 4(B)(2) statement of income and\r\nexpenses. The annual dues shall be an amount\r\nequal to the proportion of the regular dues\r\nthat expenditures for first-category\r\nactivities bear to expenditures for all Bar\r\nAssociation activities carried out during the\r\nyear. \r\n    (C) Second-category activities shall\r\nnot be funded from loans or contributions to\r\nthe Bar Association, unless otherwise\r\nspecified by the person who makes the\r\ncontribution at the moment such contribution\r\nis made and it is thus accepted by the Bar\r\nAssociation upon receipt of the same. \r\n  Rule 6 Remedial mechanisms \r\n    (A) Any bar member who pays his Rule\r\n5(B) bar dues is entitled to resort to the\r\nReview Board of the Bar Association Activities\r\n(Review Board) created by these rules, with\r\nregard to: \r\n    (1) the classification of any\r\nparticular activity included in the audited\r\nstatement of income and expenses used as basis\r\nfor the computation of dues, and/or \r\n    (2) the real expenses of a given\r\nactivity. \r\n    (3) any nonbudgeted activity funded by\r\nfirst-category activity dues that arises\r\nduring the course of the year, with respect to\r\nclassification or amount of expense.\r\n\nRules relating to the use of the Puerto Rico Bar Association funds\r\ncollected from the payment of dues and from the sale of notarial\r\nand bar stamps, as amended, January 1993 (certified translation,\r\nDkt. 376) (emphasis added) (quoted in Schneider IX, 947 F. Supp. at\r\n39). The 1992 version of Rule 6(A), extant prior to the district\r\ncourt's order, was identical except for (3), which was added as\r\nper the district court's Nov. 18, 1992 order. However, the district\r\ncourt also recommended in its order that the highlighted language\r\nin the first line of Rule 6(A), above, be changed. The relevant\r\ntext of the district court's order follows: \r\n    Plaintiffs object to the remedial\r\nmechanisms of Rule 6. As the Rule now stands,\r\nmembers must elect not to finance budgeted,\r\nnoncore activities at the beginning of the\r\nyear. Only those members who elected not to\r\nfinance noncore activities may seek review of\r\nthe budget by the Review Board of the Bar\r\nAssociation Activities (\"Review Board\"). This\r\nrule provides no avenue to object to\r\nnonbudgeted, noncore items that arise\r\nthroughout the year, which if past experience\r\nis any indication, comprise the bulk of the\r\nnoncore activities.\r\n    Thus Rule 6 must be amended to allow\r\nall members (whether they objected to the\r\nprojected budget, or approved it initially,\r\nand later dissent from a nonbudgeted, noncore\r\nactivity that was funded from the core\r\nactivity budget) to dissent at any time during\r\nthe year, and to receive a refund should the\r\nReview Board grant their petition. The court\r\nnotes that at the hearing counsel for the\r\nColegio maintained that the Rules currently\r\ncontain such a provision, and conceded that\r\nsuch a provision should be added if the Rules\r\ndid not.\r\n    The following amendments should be made\r\nto Rule 6:\r\n      a) delete \"his Rule 5(B) bar\" from\r\n  lines 1-2 of Rule 6;\r\n      b) add \"(3) any nonbudgeted activity\r\n  funded by first-category activity dues\r\n  that arises during the course of the\r\n  year, with respect to classification or\r\n  amount of expense.\" after provision (2)\r\n  of Rule 6;\r\n\nOrder, Dkt. 313 at 2 (Torruella, J.) (emphasis added to 6(A)). The\r\nmandate at the end of the district court's order states that \"[t]he\r\nparties are hereby ordered to petition the Supreme Court of Puerto\r\nRico to consider the amendments to the Rules indicated herein.\" Id.\r\nat 5. Notwithstanding the district court's use of the term\r\n\"consider,\" in fact the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico adopted all\r\nthe changes except the amendment to lines 1-2 suggesting the\r\ndeletion of \"his Rule 5(b) bar\" from Rule 6.\r\nSchneider and Ramos allege that the motion the Colegio\r\nfiled with the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico did not include\r\nlanguage describing the district court's proposed amendment to\r\nlines 1-2 of Rule 6. They claim such presentation to the\r\nCommonwealth Court was mandatory (and imply that the failure to\r\npresent was hidden from the district court by the Colegio's failure\r\nto translate its motion into English). In response, the Colegio\r\nclaims the amendment was a mere \"suggestion\" by the court, but\r\nfurther claims to have presented the entire November 18, 1992 order\r\n(in English and in Spanish translation) to the Supreme Court of\r\nPuerto Rico. This dispute was raised before the district court\r\nafter Judge Watson replaced Judge Torruella in 1995. The district\r\ncourt's opinion of Oct. 30, 1996 states:\r\n    In their motion for entry of judgment\r\nand injunctive relief, plaintiffs have argued\r\nthat the Rule reproduced above limits the\r\nright to review to those who elected not to\r\nfinance non-core activities at the beginning\r\nof the year, i.e., when the budget was first\r\nannounced or approved. Plaintiffs claim that\r\nRule 6 of the Rules still does not provide a\r\nway to object to non-budgeted, non-core items\r\nthat arise during the year for the first time.\r\n    This claim is totally incorrect. At a\r\ntime when this judge had first entered the\r\ncase, and when a complete copy of the new rule\r\nwas not in the record, the adamancy with which\r\nthis claim was advanced caused this court to\r\nhold hearings and order that a certified\r\ntranslation of the new Rule be filed. But when\r\nall is said and done plaintiffs have been\r\nunable to point to any meaningful way in which\r\nthe new Rule fails to conform to the\r\nconstitutional standards laid out by this\r\ncourt and the court of appeals.\r\n\nSchneider IX, 947 F. Supp. at 41 (Watson, J.) (emphasis added). I\r\nconcur with this judgment.\r\nOn a literal reading, the 1993 Rules as amended might\r\nappear to prevent those who \"choose to finance all bar activities\"\r\n(and thus pay Rule 5(A) dues) from changing their minds mid-year\r\nand invoking the review procedures of Rule 6(A) (limited to those\r\nwho pay \"Rule 5(B) dues\") when an unforeseen activity belonging in\r\nthe \"second-category\" is funded from the core activity budget. On\r\nthis reading, advocated by Schneider and Ramos, the amended Rules\r\nestablish an \"all or nothing\" objection rule, as it were: only\r\nthose who choose not to fund any second category activities (by\r\npaying the reduced Rule 5(B) dues) may object mid-year under Rule\r\n6 to the categorization or accounting for costs of budgeted or\r\nunbudgeted activities.\r\nHowever, as the Colegio argues, other parts of the Rules\r\ncounter such an interpretation. Specifically, language in Rule 6(C)\r\nallows for objections to unbudgeted activities by those who\r\ninitially opted to fund all activities:\r\n  [Rule 6](C) Should the Review Board determine,\r\nafter adjudicating the petitions filed for the\r\nyear in question, that the expenses for\r\nsecond-category activities exceeded the\r\nbudget, it shall order the Bar Association to\r\nmake refunds to the bar members who chose not\r\nto finance such activities, or later objected\r\nto nonbudgeted, second-category activities,\r\nand to pay interest at the legal rate\r\nprevailing at the time when the dues were\r\npaid. The Review Board shall remit all funds\r\nto dissenters within a reasonable time. The\r\nReview Board shall order any fund surplus\r\nremitted to the Bar Association.\r\n\nRule 6(C) (1993 version) (quoted in Schneider IX, 947 F. Supp. at\r\n39-40) (emphasis added). The highlighted language was recommended\r\nby the district court's Nov. 18, 1992 order, and presumably was\r\ndesigned to be consistent with the other amendments recommended by\r\nthat order. It clearly presumes that the right to object is granted\r\neven to those members who declined the option of not paying dues\r\nfor second-category activities at the beginning of the year.\r\nAs more support for the Colegio's reading, I note that\r\nlanguage suggested by the district court and now incorporated into\r\nRule 9(B) seems to distinguish 6(A) petitions from \"nonbudgeted\r\nactivity\" petitions:\r\n  [Rule 9](B) A Rule 6(A) petition objecting to\r\nbudgeted items shall be filed before the final\r\ndate set for payment of the annual dues. All\r\npetitions objecting to non-budgeted items\r\nshall be filed within ten (10) working days\r\nafter the event or item occurs.\r\n\nRule 9(B) (1993 version) (quoted in Schneider IX, 947 F. Supp. at\r\n40) (emphasis added) (highlighted sections added in response to the\r\nNov. 18, 1992 order's proposed amendments). Again, this language\r\nclearly allows any dues payer to object to nonbudgeted activities\r\n(notwithstanding the \"Rule 5(B) dues\" restriction of Rule 6(A)).\r\nThe Colegio insists that the Rules must be read this way, the\r\ndistrict court agreed, and I concur: notwithstanding the limiting\r\nlanguage in Rule 6(A), any member of the Colegio who pays dues\r\n(whether they be Rule 5(A) dues or Rule 5(B) dues) may resort to\r\nthe Review Board in order to object to \"any nonbudgeted activity\r\nfunded by first-category activity dues that arises during the\r\ncourse of the year, with respect to classification or amount of\r\nexpense\" (as per Rule 6(A)(3)) and, if successful, receive an\r\nappropriate refund.\r\nSchneider and Ramos claim that the district court should\r\nhave been bound in its 1996 ruling by the order of the court in\r\n1992, which they claim established the \"law of the case,\" and\r\nshould have insisted that the new rule \"comply strictly\" with the\r\n1992 order's recommended changes to Rule 6(A). It is true that the\r\neffect of the district court's reading in 1996, and mine, is not\r\nexactly the same as the effect of the 1992 order's recommended\r\namendment to line 1 of Rule 6(A): had the amendment to Rule 6(A)\r\nbeen made, and the language \"his Rule 5(B) bar\" been deleted, a\r\nRule 5(A) dues payer would have been able to voice objection under\r\n6(A)(1) or (2) to classification or real expenses of budgeted\r\nitems. On the district court's reading in 1996, 5(A) dues payers\r\nmay not so object to treatment of budgeted items, but only to\r\ntreatment of \"any nonbudgeted activity funded by first-category\r\nactivity dues that arises during the course of the year,\" as per\r\nRule 6(A)(3). However, objections to budgeted activities by Rule\r\n5(A) dues payers were not contemplated by the reasoning of the\r\ndistrict court's 1992 order, which was concerned with only the\r\nright of any member \"to object to nonbudgeted, noncore items that\r\narise [during the course of] the year.\" Order, Nov. 19, 1992, Dkt.\r\n313, at 2. Since the reading of the district court in 1996 gives\r\nthe Rules the effect intended by the court's 1992 order, there is\r\nno law of the case problem.\r\n\nC. Sanctions for the Colegio's failure to notify the plaintiffs of\r\nits June 20, 1991 motion to stay judgment\r\nOur opinion of December 20, 1990 (Schneider VIII, 917\r\nF.2d at 636) stayed for six months the effectiveness of the\r\ndistrict court's 1988 judgment (Schneider VII) immediately\r\nenjoining the Colegio from compelling membership until it either\r\nceased all ideological activities or implemented an adequate system\r\nto protect dissenters' rights. We took that action to give the\r\nColegio time to submit to the district court a modified rule\r\ngoverning use of compulsory dues, in the hope that such a delay\r\nwould permit the preservation of the integrated bar while allowing\r\nthe Colegio to formulate a remedy for the constitutional problems\r\nhighlighted by this litigation. During the stay, all parties\r\nsubmitted petitions for certiorari to the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States. On June 20, 1991, the date on which our stay was\r\nto expire, the Colegio requested an extension of the stay pending\r\nthe Supreme Court's consideration. The Colegio did not notify\r\nSchneider of its motion requesting the stay. On July 19, 1991, the\r\ndistrict court granted the stay of the injunction as requested,\r\nand, according to the Colegio, notified all parties. Schneider\r\nclaims the Clerk's office failed to notify him. The Supreme Court\r\ndenied certiorari on January 13, 1992. On June 30, 1992, the\r\nSupreme Court of Puerto Rico promulgated rules governing use of\r\nColegio funds, effective July 1, 1992. On August 13, 1992,\r\nSchneider and Ramos moved for sanctions against the Colegio for\r\nfailing to notify them of its motion. The court denied their\r\nrequest.\r\nSchneider and Ramos claim that as a result of the\r\nColegio's failure to give notice, \"[p]laintiffs had every reason to\r\nassume that the injunction regarding the Colegio compulsory dues\r\nwas in effect and that they were under no obligation to pay Colegio\r\ncompulsory dues and plaintiffs relied on this assumption.\"\r\nSchneider and Ramos imply that they mistakenly failed to pay their\r\nnext installment of Colegio dues and were subject to renewed\r\ndisciplinary proceedings. According to their brief (we have nothing\r\nin the record to confirm this), on September 8, 1992, the Colegio\r\ncommenced a disciplinary action against Schneider and others as a\r\nresult of their failure to continue paying dues upon the extension\r\nof the stay; the case, AB92-90, remains dormant but pending in the\r\nSupreme Court of Puerto Rico.\r\nIn denying the motion for sanctions (in its order\r\nreviewing the new rules), the district court added an important\r\nqualifier to its order, which essentially responds to the claim of\r\nSchneider and Ramos:\r\n  Plaintiffs' motion for sanctions against the\r\nColegio de Abogados, for failure to notify\r\nplaintiffs that the court stayed the\r\nreimposition of the injunction against the\r\nColegio, is denied. The plaintiffs are not\r\nrelieved from payment of their annual\r\nmembership dues and must do so within fifteen\r\n(15) days from the filing of this Order if\r\nthey wish to retain membership in the Colegio.\r\nUpon payment of the dues owed by plaintiffs,\r\nthe Colegio is ordered to rescind any request\r\nfor disbarment that may have been filed as a\r\nresult of plaintiffs' failure to timely pay\r\ntheir dues.\r\n\nOrder of Nov. 18, 1992 (Dkt. 313), at 1-2 (emphasis added). Federal\r\nRule of Civil Procedure 5 requires that all parties not in default\r\nbe served with essentially all papers and pleadings filed\r\nsubsequent to the original complaint. The rule itself does not\r\nspecify what sanctions are appropriate for violations. Where the\r\nmoving party has failed to serve a motion on the nonmoving party,\r\ncourts have struck or denied the motion or set aside the relief\r\nrequested in the motion if already granted. See 4A Charles Alan\r\nWright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure  1143 n.13\r\n(citing cases). Although the court stated that it was denying\r\nplaintiffs' motion for sanctions, it established a grace period for\r\npayment of any dues that plaintiffs mistakenly failed to pay as a\r\nresult of their lack of notice, and thereby mitigated any prejudice\r\nto plaintiffs resulting from the failure to give notice. Schneider\r\nand Ramos do not indicate exactly what further sanction they\r\nrequested below, if any, and any specific argument for further\r\nsanctions is thus waived.\r\n\nD. The Colegio's withdrawal of funds from the escrow account in\r\n1986\r\nThe Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, by resolution of\r\nNovember 13, 1984, as modified by stipulation of the parties on\r\nJanuary 23, 1985, adopted an interim remedy in consonance with the\r\nproposals of this court in Schneider V, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"440323\"><a href=\"/opinion/440323/jorge-f-romany-v-colegio-de-abogados-de-puerto-rico-oreste-ramos-diaz-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">742</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 44-45 (1st\r\nCir. 1984). Under this interim remedy, disbarred plaintiffs could\r\nrequest readmittance if they paid half their dues to the Colegio\r\nand half into an interest-bearing escrow account, where the funds\r\nwould be held until the parties and the courts worked out a final\r\nrefund procedure. Plaintiffs were allowed to escrow half their dues\r\npayable back to the first membership year for which they objected\r\nto the Colegio's ideological activities. As of December 1986,\r\nSchneider had deposited 50% of his dues for membership years 1978\r\nthrough 1986 in the escrow account; the other plaintiffs similarly\r\nhad paid half of their dues for certain years into the escrow\r\naccount. The parties stipulated that the Colegio would inform the\r\ndissenting attorneys depositing their dues into the escrow account\r\nof the account number and the name of the bank selected by the\r\nColegio to hold such account. The stipulation also provided that\r\nthe Colegio would not withdraw funds from the account \"until the\r\nclaims in dispute have been finally resolved by the Supreme Court\r\nof Puerto Rico.\" Dkt. 328, Exh. B, at 2.\r\nOn June 26, 1986, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico\r\nadopted a remedy providing for the deposit in an escrow account of\r\n15% of compulsory dues paid by any lawyer dissenting to ideological\r\nactivities of the Colegio. See Colegio II, 17 T.P.R. at 634. On\r\nDecember 24, 1986, the Colegio withdrew 70% of the balance\r\ndeposited in the escrow account and (according to plaintiffs) the\r\ntotal of the interest, leaving 30% of the deposit balances\r\nremaining in the escrow account. Since the amount originally\r\ndeposited in escrow was 50% of total dues, the 30% of deposit\r\nbalances remaining in escrow after the withdrawal corresponded to\r\n15% of total dues. Apparently the Colegio presumed that it was\r\nentitled by the terms of the 1986 remedy to reduce the dissenters'\r\ndues withholding for prior years from the 50% of total dues the\r\nSupreme Court of Puerto Rico mandated in 1984 to the 15% of total\r\ndues mandated by its 1986 decision. However, plaintiffs also claim\r\nthe Colegio withdrew all of the interest earned in the account, not\r\njust 70% of it. They also argue that nothing in the Supreme Court\r\nof Puerto Rico's opinion stated its 15%-withholding-based remedy\r\nwould be applied retroactively. Plaintiffs also allege they never\r\nreceived account statements, the name of the bank, or the number of\r\naccount, as required by the January 23, 1985 stipulation.\r\nIt is important to note what is not in dispute here:\r\nunder the district court's 1998 order, every plaintiff should\r\nultimately receive refunds equal to the total amounts originally\r\ndeposited in escrow (with interest on any previously-unrefunded\r\nportion):\r\n  [F]or the years in which plaintiffs and other\r\nlawyers, following the commencement of this\r\naction up to the promulgation of the rules\r\nreferred to above, paid 50% or another portion\r\nof their annual compulsory dues into an escrow\r\naccount and said amounts have not been\r\nrefunded then the Colegio shall refund the\r\nunrefunded amounts together with interest on\r\nthose amounts from the end of the membership\r\nyear for which they were deposited.\r\n\nSchneider XI at 1-2. The Colegio must refund any amounts that were\r\n\"paid\" but \"unrefunded,\" regardless of how much actually remains in\r\nthe escrow account. At issue, then, is only the question of\r\nsanctions. I find no abuse of discretion in the district court's\r\nconclusion that \"the fairest way to resolve\" the refund dispute,\r\nSchneider IX, 947 F. Supp. at 42, was its refund order, without the\r\nimposition of any sanction.\r\n\nE. Hctor L. Mrquez's hours\r\nSchneider purports to argue on behalf of Hector L.\r\nMrquez-Figueroa, another attorney who represented dissenting\r\nattorneys in this litigation, that the court erred in not granting\r\nan award of attorney's fees for hours expended by Mrquez on behalf\r\nof plaintiffs Jorge F. Romany, Jorge Souss-Shidrewa, and Oreste V.\r\nRamos-Daz (the \"consolidated plaintiffs\") over the course of this\r\nlitigation. The Colegio argues that this part of the appeal was not\r\nproperly noticed, as the consolidated plaintiffs were not listed in\r\nthe caption of the notice of appeal filed by Schneider. That notice\r\nis captioned \"Robert E. Schneider, Jr., et als., plaintiffs.\"\r\nFederal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(c)(1)(A) states that the\r\nnotice of appeal must \"specify the party or parties taking the\r\nappeal by naming each one in the caption or body of the notice, but\r\nan attorney representing more than one party may describe those\r\nparties with such terms as 'all plaintiffs,' 'the defendants,' 'the\r\nplaintiffs A, B, et al.,' or 'all defendants except X'.\" (Emphasis\r\nadded.) Schneider, however, was not representing Mrquez's\r\n\"consolidated plaintiffs,\" and thus was not entitled to designate\r\nthose plaintiffs as appellants informally through the use of \"et\r\nal.\" in his notice of appeal. Although Federal Rule of Appellate\r\nProcedure 3(c)(4) states that \"[a]n appeal must not be dismissed\r\nfor informality of form or title of the notice of appeal, or for\r\nfailure to name a party whose intent to appeal is otherwise clear\r\nfrom the notice,\" this rule does not save the deficiency in the\r\nnotice of appeal: \"The failure to name a party in a notice of\r\nappeal is more than excusable 'informality'; it constitutes a\r\nfailure of that party to appeal.\" Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co.,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112128\"><a href=\"/opinion/112128/torres-v-oakland-scavenger-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 314 (1988). The consolidated plaintiffs failed to\r\nappeal the court's award of attorney's fees, and we therefore lack\r\njurisdiction to consider the issue of Mrquez's fees for\r\nrepresenting them. See id. at 317.\r\n\nF. The liability of the Justices of the Supreme Court of Puerto\r\nRico for an award of attorney's fees\r\nSchneider and Ramos insist the court erred in holding\r\nthat the Justices of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico were not\r\nliable for any part of the attorney's fees award. The district\r\ncourt ruled that the Justices would not be liable for attorney's\r\nfees because they had been reduced to nominal parties early in the\r\ncase. See Schneider IX, 947 F. Supp. at 43 (fees ruling); Schneider\r\nII, 695 F.2d at 27 (Justices remain in case as nominal parties, but\r\nonly as to their \"administrative responsibilities in respect to the\r\nstamp statutes\"). Schneider and Ramos focus entirely (and\r\nunpersuasively) on the Justices' potential fees liability for their\r\n\"non-adjudicative enforcement\" and remedy-drafting actions,\r\nresponsibilities for which the Justices were not parties in this\r\ncase. The court's ruling was not an abuse of discretion.\r\n\nFor all of the reasons stated above, I concur with the\r\njudgment of the court.\n</pre>",
