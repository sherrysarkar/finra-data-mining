We  reverse, in  part,  and remand  for\r\n\nfurther proceedings.\r\n\n                          Background\r                                      Background\r                                                \r\n\nA.  Statutory Background\r                                    \r\n\n          By  way of  legal context,  we begin  with  a brief\r\n\ndiscussion  of  26  U.S.C.     6672(a),  which  governs  this\r\n\ndispute, drawing  primarily from  our decision in  Thomsen v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nUnited States, 887 F.2d 12, 14 (1st Cir. 1989).  The Internal\r                         \r\n\nRevenue  Code  (\"the Code\")  requires  employers to  withhold\r\n\nfederal taxes from  employees' wages, see 26  U.S.C.    3102,\r                                                     \r\n\n3402,  and to  hold  such amounts  in  trust for  the  United\r\n\nStates. See 26 U.S.C.   7501.   Once an employer has withheld\r                       \r\n\nthe  taxes, the IRS has  no recourse against  the employee in\r\n\nthe event of nonpayment.  When an employer fails to remit the\r\n\nwithheld taxes, the IRS is not without recourse, for the Code\r\n\nallows the IRS  to look  beyond the corporate  form and  hold\r\n\ncertain  agents and  officers of  the  corporation personally\r\n\nliable for  any taxes withheld but not paid.  See 26 U.S.C.  \r                                                             \r\n\n6672(a).\r\n\n          Title 26 U.S.C.   6672(a) provides that \r\n\n          [a]ny   person   required   to   collect,\r\n          truthfully  account for, and pay over any\r\n          tax imposed  by this title  who willfully\r\n          fails to . .  . pay over such  tax . .  .\r\n          shall,  in  addition  to other  penalties\r\n          provided by law,  be liable to a  penalty\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          equal  to  the total  amount  of  the tax\r\n          evaded,   or   not   collected,  or   not\r\n          accounted for and paid over.\r\n\nSection  6672(a) thus  permits the  IRS to  recover the  full\r\n\namount  of delinquent  withholding tax from  any \"responsible\r\n\nperson,\" i.e., one  required to collect, account  for and pay\r\n\nover the taxes, if that individual acted willfully within the\r\n\nmeaning of the section.  See Thomsen, 887 F.2d at 14.  \r                                                \r\n\nB.  Factual Background \r                                  \r\n\n          We state the facts  in the light most favorable  to\r\n\nVinick, the party opposing  summary judgment. See Hoeppner v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nCrotched  Mountain Rehabilitation  Ctr., 31  F.3d 9,  14 (1st\r                                                   \r\n\nCir. 1994).\r\n\n          Vinick  is a  certified  public  accountant and  is\r\n\ncurrently  a  partner in  his own  accounting  firm.   He has\r\n\npracticed public  accounting for  over thirty years.   Vinick\r\n\nbecame  acquainted with Richard  Letterman, then a practicing\r\n\nattorney,  in the early  1970's.  Around  1980 Letterman told\r\n\nVinick  about   the  Jefferson  Bronze   Company  (\"Jefferson\r\n\nBronze\"), a foundry in  Salem, Massachusetts, and despite its\r\n\nless than  stellar financial performance, persuaded  him that\r\n\nit would make a good investment.\r\n\n           In 1981, Vinick, Letterman and Peter Mayer1 agreed\r\n\nto  purchase  the  assets  of   Jefferson  Bronze.    In  the\r\n\ntransaction, each investor acquired one-third of the company,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Peter Mayer is Letterman's brother-in-law.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nand pledged the equity in his house as part  of the financing\r\n\npackage.  Although the record is unclear as to how, Letterman\r\n\nbecame  president, Vinick  had  the title  of treasurer,  and\r\n\nMayer  was given responsibility for the day-to-day management\r\n\nof the foundry.\r\n\n          Vinick,  a busy  accountant, desired  only to  be a\r\n\npassive investor  in Jefferson  Bronze.  Despite  his nominal\r\n\nposition as treasurer, Vinick  neither saw the company bylaws\r\n\nnor  participated  in  any  way  in  the  fiscal  or  general\r\n\nmanagement of Jefferson  Bronze.   From 1981  to 1983,  Mayer\r\n\noversaw  the day to  day operations of  Jefferson Bronze, and\r\n\nVinick  did  nothing other  than  prepare  the quarterly  tax\r\n\nreturns.\r\n\n          By  1983, the  company, under  Mayer's stewardship,\r\n\nwas  performing   poorly  and   losing  money.     That  poor\r\n\nperformance led  to  several changes  in  Jefferson  Bronze's\r\n\nstructure.   Mayer \"was  dismissed,\" and Vinick  asked Ronald\r\n\nOuellette, a Jefferson  Bronze employee, to  assume oversight\r\n\nof  the  day-to-day operations  of the  foundry.   Vinick and\r\n\nLetterman, in  exchange for obtaining the  release of Mayer's\r\n\nhouse  from  the   financing  arrangement,  acquired  Mayer's\r\n\ninterest in Jefferson Bronze and each became a fifty  percent\r\n\nowner.   As part of  the restructuring, Vinick  and Letterman\r\n\nsecured new  financing in the  amount of  $300,000 which  was\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nused  to pay off the  original loan and  for working capital,\r\n\nonce again pledging each of their houses as collateral.\r\n\n          Between 1983  and 1987, Ouellette  continued to run\r\n\nJefferson   Bronze  and  Vinick's  involvement  continued  to\r\n\nconsist, with  a few  exceptions, of preparing  the quarterly\r\n\ntax  returns.   During 1985,  Ouellette informed  Vinick that\r\n\nJefferson  Bronze had  become delinquent  in its  withholding\r\n\ntaxes.   Vinick  informed Letterman  of the  problem and  all\r\n\nthree shareholders  agreed to attend a meeting with a revenue\r\n\nofficer  to resolve  the situation.   Upon  arrival, however,\r\n\nLetterman  and Ouellette refused to attend the meeting.  They\r\n\nwaited outside in  the car  while Vinick alone  met with  the\r\n\nrevenue  agent and  negotiated  a  payment  plan.   \"On  rare\r\n\noccasion\" during this period,  Vinick also reported Jefferson\r\n\nBronze's poor performance to Letterman and sought suggestions\r\n\nfor  ways to improve the company's operations.  At some point\r\n\nbetween 1983  and 1987,  apparently because of  the continued\r\n\npoor   performance  of  the  company,  Letterman  and  Vinick\r\n\nborrowed  $35,000  from  the former  owner.    That debt  was\r\n\nsecured with personal guarantees.\r\n\n          In 1987,  Letterman decided to assume  oversight of\r\n\nthe  daily operations  of the foundry.   Vinick  continued to\r\n\nprepare the quarterly tax returns.   He and Letterman secured\r\n\nan additional  $300,000 of  financing, this time  by pledging\r\n\nthe  assets of the company and their personal guarantees.  As\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\na condition of the loan, the  lending bank required Jefferson\r\n\nBronze to  transfer  its checking  account  to the  bank  and\r\n\ninsisted that both Letterman and Vinick become signatories on\r\n\nthe  account.   Vinick,  however, never  exercised his  check\r\n\nsigning authority  nor did  he have  access to  the corporate\r\n\ncheckbook.   His involvement  in the management  of Jefferson\r\n\nBronze remained minimal.\r\n\n          After Letterman took over active  management of the\r\n\ncompany, Vinick  spoke with either Letterman or his wife (who\r\n\nserved  as bookkeeper)  once every  four to  five weeks.   On\r\n\noccasion he would  discuss \"the problem of unpaid  taxes\" and\r\n\nwould   urge   the   Lettermans   to   remit   these   taxes.\r\n\nSpecifically, each time he prepared a quarterly tax return he\r\n\ndiscussed the withholding taxes  with the Lettermans, learned\r\n\nwhether  or not  the taxes  had been  deposited, and  if not,\r\n\nurged  the Lettermans  to make  the deposits.   Each  time he\r\n\nraised  the issue with  the Lettermans, they  promised to pay\r\n\nthe taxes,  and Vinick relied on their assurances.  Beginning\r\n\nin  April  1989, Jefferson  Bronze again  fell behind  in its\r\n\nwithholding tax obligations.\r\n\n          In  December  1990,  the  IRS  made  an  assessment\r\n\nagainst Vinick  and Letterman, each in the  amount of $49,129\r\n\nfor unpaid withholding  taxes for the last  three quarters of\r\n\n1989  and the  first two quarters  of 1990.   Vinick paid one\r\n\nquarter's worth  of  the  assessment, filed  a  claim  for  a\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nrefund,  and  upon  IRS  denial,  brought a  refund  suit  in\r\n\ndistrict  court.  The  IRS counterclaimed for  the balance of\r\n\nthe assessment  and moved  for summary judgment  against both\r\n\nLetterman and  Vinick.   The district court,  concluding that\r\n\nboth Vinick and Letterman  were responsible persons who acted\r\n\nwillfully under    6672(a), granted summary  judgment for the\r\n\nIRS.  Vinick alone now appeals.2\r\n\n                      Standard of Review\r                                  Standard of Review\r                                                    \r\n\n          We review  the award  of summary judgment  de novo.\r                                                                        \r\n\nSee Ortiz-Pinero v.

P. 56(c) and (e).\r\n\n          As in other tax litigation, the person  challenging\r\n\nan  assessment under    6672(a) bears  the burden  of proving\r\n\nthat he is  not a responsible person.  See Caterino v. United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates, 794 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1986).  Vinick thus bears the\r                  \r\n\nultimate burden  of proving  that    6672(a) does not  impose\r\n\nliability on him  for Jefferson  Bronze's unpaid  withholding\r\n\ntaxes.  See id.  At the summary  judgment stage, however, the\r                           \r\n\nIRS, as the moving party, has the burden of demonstrating the\r\n\nabsence of a  genuine issue of material fact as  to whether  \r\n\n6672(a)  applies and that it deserves judgment as a matter of\r\n\nlaw.    Vinick's  burden,   as  the  party  opposing  summary\r\n\njudgment,  remains the same as  any opposing party:   he must\r\n\ndemonstrate  that disputed  facts preclude  summary judgment.\r\n\nSee  O'Connor v.

At bottom, in order\r                  \r\n\nto be  responsible, an  individual must have  had significant\r\n\ncontrol  over the  financial  affairs of  the  company.

Internal Revenue Serv., 988\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d  1449,  1455 (5th  Cir. 1993),  or  of specific  acts of\r\n\nmanagement  or financial decision-making  that would manifest\r\n\nthe  level of control  necessary for  responsibility, various\r\n\nindicia may  establish responsibility under    6672(a).  Such\r\n\nindicia  include  the   holding  of  corporate   office,  the\r\n\nauthority to disburse corporate  funds, stock ownership,  and\r\n\nthe ability to  hire and  fire employees.   See Thomsen,  887\r                                                                   \r\n\nF.2d at 16.\r\n\n          The  IRS  has offered  no evidence  suggesting that\r\n\nVinick had  the actual responsibility to  pay the withholding\r\n\ntaxes.  Indeed, that was Letterman's duty.  As to Vinick, the\r\n\nIRS   established   some  of   the   recognized  indicia   of\r\n\nresponsibility.  During the  quarters in controversy,  Vinick\r\n\nheld the office of treasurer, prepared the quarterly returns,\r\n\nspoke  occasionally with  the Lettermans  about the  business\r\n\n(including the  problem of  unpaid taxes), had  check signing\r\n\nauthority, and had pledged  his personal assets and guarantee\r\n\nin order to secure company financing.  See Caterino, 794 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\nat   5-6   (evaluating  individual's   responsibility  during\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\ndelinquent  quarters); see  also  Barnett, 988  F.2d at  1455\r                                                     \r\n\n(same).   From  these indicia  alone,  one might  infer  that\r\n\nVinick was a responsible person.  \r\n\n          The   record  in  this  case,  however,  permits  a\r\n\ncompeting inference.   Vinick testified that  from the outset\r\n\nof their venture he made it clear to Letterman and Mayer that\r\n\nhis  role was to be no more  than that of a passive investor.\r\n\nDuring the relevant quarters,  Vinick neither hired nor fired\r\n\nanyone, nor  inserted  himself into  the  company  structure,\r\n\ninitiated change  or made  strategic decisions.   Although he\r\n\ntechnically  possessed  check  writing  authority,  he  never\r\n\npossessed  the checkbook, nor did he write any checks.  While\r\n\nVinick did  approach Ouellette to run the  company when Mayer\r\n\nwas dismissed  and negotiated  a settlement  with the  IRS in\r\n\n1985  for  delinquent  withholding  taxes, neither  of  those\r\n\nincidents   occurred   during  the   quarters   in  question.\r\n\nLetterman, in his deposition, claimed that previous  managers\r\n\nhad indicated  that Vinick had more  than minimal involvement\r\n\nin management.   Letterman  admitted, however, that  after he\r\n\ntook over Vinick's involvement was minimal.3\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  Vinick's situation resembles that of the plaintiff in the\r\nFourth  Circuit case O'Connor  v. United States,  956 F.2d 48\r                                                           \r\n(4th Cir. 1991).   In O'Connor,  the Fourth Circuit  reversed\r                                          \r\nthe award of summary judgment for the IRS against a corporate\r\nvice president who, like Vinick,  averred that the record did\r\nnot establish his responsibility as a matter of law.  See id.\r                                                                         \r\nat  52.  The district  court granted summary  judgment on the\r\nbasis that  O'Connor demonstrated  many of the  indicia of  a\r\nresponsible  person:  he was  a founder, fifty percent owner,\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\n          In short, while the record in this case may contain\r\n\nsufficient  evidence  from  which  one  could infer  Vinick's\r\n\nresponsibility as a matter of fact, \"[t]he sufficiency of the\r\n\ngovernment's evidence was not the proper test on a motion for\r\n\nsummary judgment.\"   Rem, 38 F.3d at  645.  In  reversing the\r                                    \r\n\ndistrict court on this issue we by no means absolve Vinick or\r\n\nin any way pass on whether he is or is  not responsible under\r\n\n  6672(a).4   We  simply conclude  that on  the basis of  the\r\n\nevidence before  us, a reasonable jury could find that Vinick\r\n\nwas not a responsible person.\r\n\n C.  Willfulness under   6672(a)\r                                            \r\n\n          Assuming a jury finds  Vinick a responsible  person\r\n\nunder   6672(a), a predicate to the question of  willfulness,\r\n\nwe affirm the district court's conclusion that the undisputed\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nofficer  and director of the company; he had the authority to\r\nsign checks; he  had a general familiarity with the financial\r\naffairs  of the company.  See O'Connor v. United States, 1991\r                                                                   \r\nWL  64479, at *4 (D. Md.).   In reversing, the Fourth Circuit\r\nconcluded  that  the  absence  of  evidence  suggesting  that\r\nO'Connor  either  exercised   any  authority  over  financial\r\naffairs or general management, or was under a duty to  do so,\r\nprecluded the entry  of summary judgment  and left for  trial\r\nthe issue  of O'Connor's actual  level of involvement  in the\r\ncompany.  Id. at 50-52.   \r                         \r\n\n4.  Unlike Thomsen,  where we  affirmed the  district court's\r                              \r\ngrant of a judgment as a matter of law for the IRS, this case\r\npresents a very different  factual scenario.  In Thomsen,  in\r                                                                    \r\naddition to  various indicia of responsibility, we identified\r\n\"concrete  indications of Thomsen's  actual authority.\"   887\r\nF.2d at  16-17.  Thomsen  affirmatively made the  decision to\r\nclose  the  business and  took  possession  of the  corporate\r\nbooks, records and remaining inventory.  See id. at 17.\r                                                            \r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nfacts establish that  Vinick acted willfully  as a matter  of\r\n\nlaw.\r\n\n          Section  6672(a) contemplates  a civil  penalty the\r\n\npurpose  of which  is to protect  governmental revenue.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nThomsen,  887  F.2d at  17.    Willfulness under     6672(a),\r                   \r\n\ntherefore, does not depend on the presence of either criminal\r\n\nmotive or the specific intent to defraud the government.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nid.    Instead,  an  individual  who  acts with  a  \"reckless\r               \r\n\ndisregard\" of  a known  or obvious  risk  of nonpayment  acts\r\n\nwillfully.   See id. at 18.  We have recognized three factual\r                                \r\n\nscenarios that  meet this  standard:  (1)  reliance upon  the\r\n\nstatements  of a person in  control of the  finances when the\r\n\ncircumstances  show  that  the responsible  person  knew  the\r\n\nperson to  be unreliable;  (2) failure  to investigate  or to\r\n\ncorrect mismanagement after  having notice  of nonpayment  of\r\n\nwithholding taxes; and  (3) knowing that  the business is  in\r\n\nfinancial  trouble  and  continuing  to  pay  other creditors\r\n\nwithout  making reasonable  inquiry as  to the status  of the\r\n\nwithholding taxes.  See id. at 18-19 (internal quotations and\r                                       \r\n\ncitations omitted).      With respect to the  first scenario,\r\n\na  responsible person  acts with  reckless disregard  when he\r\n\n\"had knowledge  that the  other  individual had  in the  past\r\n\nfailed  to perform  adequately with  regard to  the financial\r\n\naffairs  of  the  taxpayer  entity.\"    Id.  at 18  (internal\r                                                       \r\n\nquotation        and        citation        omitted).        \r\n          Once a 'responsible person' has had clear\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\n          notice  that  the person  to whom  he has\r\n          delegated  responsibility for  paying the\r\n          taxes  has wrongfully failed  to pay them\r\n          in  the  past, he  continues  to delegate\r\n          that  responsibility  at  his own  peril.\r\n          Should the  \"responsible person\" continue\r\n          to  delegate, without  taking appropriate\r\n          measures  to  assure  that the  delegated\r\n          person will not repeat the dereliction in\r\n          the future, the subsequent willfulness of\r\n          the delegatee in once more failing to pay\r\n          the   taxes  will   be  imputed   to  the\r\n          \"responsible person.\"  \r\n\nId. at 19.  \r               \r\n\n          The undisputed  facts  establish that  as early  as\r\n\n1985 Vinick knew of Letterman's unreliability with respect to\r\n\nthe  withholding  taxes.    Vinick  admitted  that  Letterman\r\n\nrefused  to accompany him to  a meeting with  a revenue agent\r\n\nafter the first delinquency.   Letterman and Ouellette waited\r\n\nin the car while Vinick negotiated a payment plan.\r\n\n          Vinick also admitted that after Letterman took over\r\n\nday-to-day management of Jefferson Bronze, he had discussions\r\n\nwith  either  Letterman  or  Letterman's  wife  whenever   he\r\n\nprepared  a quarterly  return.   On  those occasions,  Vinick\r\n\nurged  the Lettermans to pay the taxes and they promised they\r\n\nwould.   Vinick asserted that  while he had  knowledge of the\r\n\nunpaid  taxes, his  absolute  lack of  any  control over  the\r\n\ndisbursement of funds rendered that knowledge meaningless.\r\n\n          While  such knowledge  may not  bear on  Vinick's  \r\n\n6672(a) responsibility,  should a jury  find him responsible,\r\n\nit  relates directly  to a  proper evaluation  of  whether he\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nacted willfully.  Vinick concedes that he knew of Letterman's\r\n\ndelinquency.   Yet Vinick  relied on Letterman's  promises of\r\n\nfuture payment  without further investigation  even though he\r\n\nrealized that  the  delinquency  continued.5    Thus,  should\r\n\nVinick be  found to be  a responsible party,  the willfulness\r\n\nprong has been met.\r\n\n                          Conclusion\r                                      Conclusion\r                                                \r\n\n          We reverse the district court's  determination that\r\n\nVinick  was  a responsible  person as  a  matter of  law, but\r\n\naffirm the  court's conclusion that  Vinick acted  willfully.\r\n\nWe remand  this  case  to  the  district  court  for  further\r\n\nproceedings  on the  issue of  responsibility, and  note that\r\n\nshould a jury find Vinick responsible, he acted willfully  as\r\n\na matter of law.  \r\n\n          Affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded.\r                      Affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded.\r                                                                      \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  Although Vinick made no arguments, either in his brief or\r\nat  oral  argument,  specific to  willfulness  separate  from\r\nresponsibility, he could argue that  he did not act willfully\r\nat least during the first  quarter in which Jefferson  Bronze\r\nwent delinquent.   The  previous events, such  as Letterman's\r\n1985  refusal  to  meet with  a  revenue  agent  and Vinick's\r\nknowledge that Letterman, on occasion, subsequently failed to\r\npay, necessarily gave Vinick the \"knowledge  that [Letterman]\r\nhad in the past  failed to perform adequately with  regard to\r\nthe  financial affairs\"  of Jefferson  Bronze.

United States, 887 F.2d 12, 14 (1st Cir.1989).  The Internal Revenue Code (\"the Code\") requires employers to withhold federal taxes from employees' wages, see 26 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3102, 3402, and to hold such amounts in trust for the United States.  See 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7501.  Once an employer has withheld the taxes, the IRS has no recourse against the employee in the event of nonpayment.  When an employer fails to remit the withheld taxes, the IRS is not without recourse, for the Code allows the IRS to look beyond the corporate form and hold certain agents and officers of the corporation personally liable for any taxes withheld but not paid.  See 26 U.S.C. &#167; 6672(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Title 26 U.S.C. &#167; 6672(a) provides that</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p>[a]ny person required to collect, truthfully account for, and pay over any tax imposed by this title who willfully fails to ... pay over such tax ... shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be liable to a penalty equal to the total amount of the tax evaded, or not collected, or not accounted for and paid over.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 6672(a) thus permits the IRS to recover the full amount of delinquent withholding tax from any \"responsible person,\" i.e., one required to collect, account for and pay over the taxes, if that individual acted willfully within the meaning of the section.  See Thomsen, 887 F.2d at 14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We state the facts in the light most favorable to Vinick, the party opposing summary judgment.  See Hoeppner v. Crotched Mountain Rehabilitation Ctr., 31 F.3d 9, 14 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vinick is a certified public accountant and is currently a partner in his own accounting firm.  He has practiced public accounting for over thirty years.  Vinick became acquainted with Richard Letterman, then a practicing attorney, in the early 1970's.  Around 1980 Letterman told Vinick about the Jefferson Bronze Company (\"Jefferson Bronze\"), a foundry in Salem, Massachusetts, and despite its less than stellar financial performance, persuaded him that it would make a good investment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1981, Vinick, Letterman and Peter Mayer<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> agreed to purchase the assets of Jefferson Bronze.  In the transaction, each investor acquired one-third of the company, and pledged the equity in his house as part of the financing package.  Although the record is unclear as to how, Letterman became president, Vinick had the title of treasurer, and Mayer was given responsibility for the day-to-day management of the foundry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vinick, a busy accountant, desired only to be a passive investor in Jefferson Bronze.  Despite his nominal position as treasurer, Vinick neither saw the company bylaws nor participated in any way in the fiscal or general management of Jefferson Bronze.  From 1981 to 1983, Mayer oversaw the day to day operations of Jefferson Bronze, and Vinick did nothing other than prepare the quarterly tax returns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By 1983, the company, under Mayer's stewardship, was performing poorly and losing money.  That poor performance led to several changes in Jefferson Bronze's structure.  Mayer \"was dismissed,\" and Vinick asked Ronald Ouellette, a Jefferson Bronze employee, to assume oversight of the day-to-day operations of the foundry.  Vinick and Letterman, in exchange for obtaining the release of Mayer's house from the financing arrangement, acquired Mayer's interest in Jefferson Bronze and each became a fifty percent owner.  As part of the restructuring, Vinick and Letterman secured new financing in the amount of $300,000 which was used to pay off the original loan and for working capital, once again pledging each of their houses as collateral.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between 1983 and 1987, Ouellette continued to run Jefferson Bronze and Vinick's involvement continued to consist, with a few exceptions, of preparing the quarterly tax returns.  During 1985, Ouellette informed Vinick that Jefferson Bronze had become delinquent in its withholding taxes.  Vinick informed Letterman of the problem and all three shareholders agreed to attend a meeting with a revenue officer to resolve the situation.  Upon arrival, however, Letterman and Ouellette refused to attend the meeting.  They waited outside in the car while Vinick alone met with the revenue agent and negotiated a payment plan.  \"On rare occasion\" during this period, Vinick also reported Jefferson Bronze's poor performance to Letterman and sought suggestions for ways to improve the company's operations.  At some point between 1983 and 1987, apparently because of the continued poor performance of the company, Letterman and Vinick borrowed $35,000 from the former owner.  That debt was secured with personal guarantees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1987, Letterman decided to assume oversight of the daily operations of the foundry.  Vinick continued to prepare the quarterly tax returns.  He and Letterman secured an additional $300,000 of financing, this time by pledging the assets of the company and their personal guarantees.  As a condition of the loan, the lending bank required Jefferson Bronze to transfer its checking account to the bank and insisted that both Letterman and Vinick become signatories on the account.  Vinick, however, never exercised his check signing authority nor did he have access to the corporate checkbook.  His involvement in the management of Jefferson Bronze remained minimal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Letterman took over active management of the company, Vinick spoke with either Letterman or his wife (who served as bookkeeper) once every four to five weeks.  On occasion he would discuss \"the problem of unpaid taxes\" and would urge the Lettermans to remit these taxes.  Specifically, each time he prepared a quarterly tax return he discussed the withholding taxes with the Lettermans, learned whether or not the taxes had been deposited, and if not, urged the Lettermans to make the deposits.  Each time he raised the issue with the Lettermans, they promised to pay the taxes, and Vinick relied on their assurances.  Beginning in April 1989, Jefferson Bronze again fell behind in its withholding tax obligations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1990, the IRS made an assessment against Vinick and Letterman, each in the amount of $49,129 for unpaid withholding taxes for the last three quarters of 1989 and the first two quarters of 1990.  Vinick paid one quarter's worth of the assessment, filed a claim for a refund, and upon IRS denial, brought a refund suit in district court.  The IRS counterclaimed for the balance of the assessment and moved for summary judgment against both Letterman and Vinick.  The district court, concluding that both Vinick and Letterman were responsible persons who acted willfully under &#167; 6672(a), granted summary judgment for the IRS.  Vinick alone now appeals.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the award of summary judgment de novo.  See Ortiz-Pinero v. Rivera-Arroyo, 84 F.3d 7, 11 (1st Cir.1996).  Summary judgment is appropriate in the absence of a genuine issue of material fact, when the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  A fact is material when it has the potential to affect the outcome of the suit.  See J. Geils Band Employee Benefit Plan v. Smith Barney Shearson, Inc., 76 F.3d 1245, 1250-51 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 81, 136 L.Ed.2d 39 (1996).  Neither party may rely on conclusory allegations or unsubstantiated denials, but must identify specific facts derived from the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions and affidavits to demonstrate either the existence or absence of an issue of fact.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c) and (e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As in other tax litigation, the person challenging an assessment under &#167; 6672(a) bears the burden of proving that he is not a responsible person.  See Caterino v. United States, 794 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1986).  Vinick thus bears the ultimate burden of proving that &#167; 6672(a) does not impose liability on him for Jefferson Bronze's unpaid withholding taxes.  See id.   At the summary judgment stage, however, the IRS, as the moving party, has the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact as to whether &#167; 6672(a) applies and that it deserves judgment as a matter of law.  Vinick's burden, as the party opposing summary judgment, remains the same as any opposing party:  he must demonstrate that disputed facts preclude summary judgment.  See O'Connor v. United States, 956 F.2d 48, 50 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In granting summary judgment in favor of the IRS, the district court determined both that Vinick was a responsible person and that he acted willfully as a matter of law.  We consider each of these issues in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Responsible under &#167; 6672(a)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have noted, \"[c]ourts have explicitly given the word 'responsible' a broad interpretation.\"  Caterino, 794 F.2d at 5. Specifically, responsibility \"is a matter of status, duty, and authority,\" Thomsen, 887 F.2d at 16 (internal quotations and citations omitted), aimed at the ultimate determination of \"whether the person had the power to determine whether the taxes should be remitted or paid or had 'the final word as to what bills should or should not be paid and when,' \" Caterino, 794 F.2d at 5 (quoting Adams v. United States, 504 F.2d 73, 75 (7th Cir.1974)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We impose responsibility on \"all with the responsibility and authority to avoid the default,\" Harrington v. United States, 504 F.2d 1306, 1312 (1st Cir.1974), but predicate our definition of who is a responsible person on the function of the employee in the business, and not the level of the office held, see Caterino, 794 F.2d at 5;  see also O'Connor, 956 F.2d at 51 (indicating that &#167; 6672(a) liability must derive from substance, not form).  As the Second Circuit recently stated, &#167; 6672(a) \"is not meant to ensnare those who have merely technical authority or titular designation,\" but instead encompasses those close enough to the business to prevent the default.  United States v. Rem, 38 F.3d 634, 642 (2d Cir.1994).  At bottom, in order to be responsible, an individual must have had significant control over the financial affairs of the company.  See Caterino, 794 F.2d at 5;  see also Rem, 38 F.3d at 642;  United States v. Carrigan, 31 F.3d 130, 133 (3rd Cir.1994).  The individual assessed either must have exercised his authority over financial affairs or general management, or must have had a duty to do so.  See O'Connor, 956 F.2d at 51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the absence of uncontroverted evidence establishing an individual's \"precise responsibility\" to pay withholding taxes, see Barnett v. Internal Revenue Serv., 988 F.2d 1449, 1455 (5th Cir.1993), or of specific acts of management or financial decision-making that would manifest the level of control necessary for responsibility, various indicia may establish responsibility under &#167; 6672(a).  Such indicia include the holding of corporate office, the authority to disburse corporate funds, stock ownership, and the ability to hire and fire employees.  See Thomsen, 887 F.2d at 16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IRS has offered no evidence suggesting that Vinick had the actual responsibility to pay the withholding taxes.  Indeed, that was Letterman's duty.  As to Vinick, the IRS established some of the recognized indicia of responsibility.  During the quarters in controversy, Vinick held the office of treasurer, prepared the quarterly returns, spoke occasionally with the Lettermans about the business (including the problem of unpaid taxes), had check signing authority, and had pledged his personal assets and guarantee in order to secure company financing.  See Caterino, 794 F.2d at 5-6 (evaluating individual's responsibility during delinquent quarters);  see also Barnett, 988 F.2d at 1455 (same).  From these indicia alone, one might infer that Vinick was a responsible person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record in this case, however, permits a competing inference.  Vinick testified that from the outset of their venture he made it clear to Letterman and Mayer that his role was to be no more than that of a passive investor.  During the relevant quarters, Vinick neither hired nor fired anyone, nor inserted himself into the company structure, initiated change or made strategic decisions.  Although he technically possessed check writing authority, he never possessed the checkbook, nor did he write any checks.  While Vinick did approach Ouellette to run the company when Mayer was dismissed and negotiated a settlement with the IRS in 1985 for delinquent withholding taxes, neither of those incidents occurred during the quarters in question.  Letterman, in his deposition, claimed that previous managers had indicated that Vinick had more than minimal involvement in management.  Letterman admitted, however, that after he took over Vinick's involvement was minimal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, while the record in this case may contain sufficient evidence from which one could infer Vinick's responsibility as a matter of fact, \"[t]he sufficiency of the government's evidence was not the proper test on a motion for summary judgment.\"  Rem, 38 F.3d at 645.   In reversing the district court on this issue we by no means absolve Vinick or in any way pass on whether he is or is not responsible under &#167; 6672(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  We simply conclude that on the basis of the evidence before us, a reasonable jury could find that Vinick was not a responsible person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Willfulness under &#167; 6672(a)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming a jury finds Vinick a responsible person under &#167; 6672(a), a predicate to the question of willfulness, we affirm the district court's conclusion that the undisputed facts establish that Vinick acted willfully as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 6672(a) contemplates a civil penalty the purpose of which is to protect governmental revenue.  See Thomsen, 887 F.2d at 17.   Willfulness under &#167; 6672(a), therefore, does not depend on the presence of either criminal motive or the specific intent to defraud the government.  See id.   Instead, an individual who acts with a \"reckless disregard\" of a known or obvious risk of nonpayment acts willfully.  See id. at 18.   We have recognized three factual scenarios that meet this standard:  (1) reliance upon the statements of a person in control of the finances when the circumstances show that the responsible person knew the person to be unreliable;  (2) failure to investigate or to correct mismanagement after having notice of nonpayment of withholding taxes;  and (3) knowing that the business is in financial trouble and continuing to pay other creditors without making reasonable inquiry as to the status of the withholding taxes.  See id. at 18-19 (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the first scenario, a responsible person acts with reckless disregard when he \"had knowledge that the other individual had in the past failed to perform adequately with regard to the financial affairs of the taxpayer entity.\"  Id. at 18 (internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>Once a \"responsible person\" has had clear notice that the person to whom he has delegated responsibility for paying the taxes has wrongfully failed to pay them in the past, he continues to delegate that responsibility at his own peril.  Should the \"responsible person\" continue to delegate, without taking appropriate measures to assure that the delegated person will not repeat the dereliction in the future, the subsequent willfulness of the delegatee in once more failing to pay the taxes will be imputed to the \"responsible person.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The undisputed facts establish that as early as 1985 Vinick knew of Letterman's unreliability with respect to the withholding taxes.  Vinick admitted that Letterman refused to accompany him to a meeting with a revenue agent after the first delinquency.  Letterman and Ouellette waited in the car while Vinick negotiated a payment plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vinick also admitted that after Letterman took over day-to-day management of Jefferson Bronze, he had discussions with either Letterman or Letterman's wife whenever he prepared a quarterly return.  On those occasions, Vinick urged the Lettermans to pay the taxes and they promised they would.  Vinick asserted that while he had knowledge of the unpaid taxes, his absolute lack of any control over the disbursement of funds rendered that knowledge meaningless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While such knowledge may not bear on Vinick's &#167; 6672(a) responsibility, should a jury find him responsible, it relates directly to a proper evaluation of whether he acted willfully.  Vinick concedes that he knew of Letterman's delinquency.  Yet Vinick relied on Letterman's promises of future payment without further investigation even though he realized that the delinquency continued.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Thus, should Vinick be found to be a responsible party, the willfulness prong has been met.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reverse the district court's determination that Vinick was a responsible person as a matter of law, but affirm the court's conclusion that Vinick acted willfully.  We remand this case to the district court for further proceedings on the issue of responsibility, and note that should a jury find Vinick responsible, he acted willfully as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Peter Mayer is Letterman's brother-in-law</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The record reflects that in 1992, Letterman was disbarred after he pled guilty to four counts of larceny and one count of embezzlement by a fiduciary, charges all unrelated to Jefferson Bronze.

United States, 956 F.2d 48 (4th Cir.1992).  In O'Connor, the Fourth Circuit reversed the award of summary judgment for the IRS against a corporate vice president who, like Vinick, averred that the record did not establish his responsibility as a matter of law.  See id. at 52.   The district court granted summary judgment on the basis that O'Connor demonstrated many of the indicia of a responsible person:  he was a founder, fifty percent owner, officer and director of the company;  he had the authority to sign checks;  he had a general familiarity with the financial affairs of the company.  See O'Connor v. United States, 1991 WL 64479, at * 4 (D.Md.). In reversing, the Fourth Circuit concluded that the absence of evidence suggesting that O'Connor either exercised any authority over financial affairs or general management, or was under a duty to do so, precluded the entry of summary judgment and left for trial the issue of O'Connor's actual level of involvement in the company.  Id. at 50-52</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Unlike Thomsen, where we affirmed the district court's grant of a judgment as a matter of law for the IRS, this case presents a very different factual scenario.  In Thomsen, in addition to various indicia of responsibility, we identified \"concrete indications of Thomsen's actual authority.\"  887 F.2d at 16-17.   Thomsen affirmatively made the decision to close the business and took possession of the corporate books, records and remaining inventory.  See id. at 17</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Although Vinick made no arguments, either in his brief or at oral argument, specific to willfulness separate from responsibility, he could argue that he did not act willfully at least during the first quarter in which Jefferson Bronze went delinquent.  The previous events, such as Letterman's 1985 refusal to meet with a revenue agent and Vinick's knowledge that Letterman, on occasion, subsequently failed to pay, necessarily gave Vinick the \"knowledge that [Letterman] had in the past failed to perform adequately with regard to the financial affairs\" of Jefferson Bronze.

The Internal Revenue Code (\"the Code\") requires employers to withhold federal taxes from employees' wages, see 26 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3102, 3402, and to hold such amounts in trust for the United States.  See 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7501.  Once an employer has withheld the taxes, the IRS has no recourse against the employee in the event of nonpayment.  When an employer fails to remit the withheld taxes, the IRS is not without recourse, for the Code allows the IRS to look beyond the corporate form and hold certain agents and officers of the corporation personally liable for any taxes withheld but not paid.  See 26 U.S.C. &#167; 6672(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Title 26 U.S.C. &#167; 6672(a) provides that</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p>[a]ny person required to collect, truthfully account for, and pay over any tax imposed by this title who willfully fails to ... pay over such tax ... shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be liable to a penalty equal to the total amount of the tax evaded, or not collected, or not accounted for and paid over.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 6672(a) thus permits the IRS to recover the full amount of delinquent withholding tax from any \"responsible person,\" i.e., one required to collect, account for and pay over the taxes, if that individual acted willfully within the meaning of the section.  See Thomsen, 887 F.2d at 14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We state the facts in the light most favorable to Vinick, the party opposing summary judgment.  See Hoeppner v. Crotched Mountain Rehabilitation Ctr., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195529\"><a href=\"/opinion/195529/hoeppner-v-crotched-mountain/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vinick is a certified public accountant and is currently a partner in his own accounting firm.  He has practiced public accounting for over thirty years.  Vinick became acquainted with Richard Letterman, then a practicing attorney, in the early 1970's.  Around 1980 Letterman told Vinick about the Jefferson Bronze Company (\"Jefferson Bronze\"), a foundry in Salem, Massachusetts, and despite its less than stellar financial performance, persuaded him that it would make a good investment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1981, Vinick, Letterman and Peter Mayer<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> agreed to purchase the assets of Jefferson Bronze.  In the transaction, each investor acquired one-third of the company, and pledged the equity in his house as part of the financing package.  Although the record is unclear as to how, Letterman became president, Vinick had the title of treasurer, and Mayer was given responsibility for the day-to-day management of the foundry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vinick, a busy accountant, desired only to be a passive investor in Jefferson Bronze.  Despite his nominal position as treasurer, Vinick neither saw the company bylaws nor participated in any way in the fiscal or general management of Jefferson Bronze.  From 1981 to 1983, Mayer oversaw the day to day operations of Jefferson Bronze, and Vinick did nothing other than prepare the quarterly tax returns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By 1983, the company, under Mayer's stewardship, was performing poorly and losing money.  That poor performance led to several changes in Jefferson Bronze's structure.  Mayer \"was dismissed,\" and Vinick asked Ronald Ouellette, a Jefferson Bronze employee, to assume oversight of the day-to-day operations of the foundry.  Vinick and Letterman, in exchange for obtaining the release of Mayer's house from the financing arrangement, acquired Mayer's interest in Jefferson Bronze and each became a fifty percent owner.  As part of the restructuring, Vinick and Letterman secured new financing in the amount of $300,000 which was used to pay off the original loan and for working capital, once again pledging each of their houses as collateral.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Between 1983 and 1987, Ouellette continued to run Jefferson Bronze and Vinick's involvement continued to consist, with a few exceptions, of preparing the quarterly tax returns.  During 1985, Ouellette informed Vinick that Jefferson Bronze had become delinquent in its withholding taxes.  Vinick informed Letterman of the problem and all three shareholders agreed to attend a meeting with a revenue officer to resolve the situation.  Upon arrival, however, Letterman and Ouellette refused to attend the meeting.  They waited outside in the car while Vinick alone met with the revenue agent and negotiated a payment plan.  \"On rare occasion\" during this period, Vinick also reported Jefferson Bronze's poor performance to Letterman and sought suggestions for ways to improve the company's operations.  At some point between 1983 and 1987, apparently because of the continued poor performance of the company, Letterman and Vinick borrowed $35,000 from the former owner.  That debt was secured with personal guarantees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1987, Letterman decided to assume oversight of the daily operations of the foundry.  Vinick continued to prepare the quarterly tax returns.  He and Letterman secured an additional $300,000 of financing, this time by pledging the assets of the company and their personal guarantees.  As a condition of the loan, the lending bank required Jefferson Bronze to transfer its checking account to the bank and insisted that both Letterman and Vinick become signatories on the account.  Vinick, however, never exercised his check signing authority nor did he have access to the corporate checkbook.  His involvement in the management of Jefferson Bronze remained minimal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Letterman took over active management of the company, Vinick spoke with either Letterman or his wife (who served as bookkeeper) once every four to five weeks.  On occasion he would discuss \"the problem of unpaid taxes\" and would urge the Lettermans to remit these taxes.  Specifically, each time he prepared a quarterly tax return he discussed the withholding taxes with the Lettermans, learned whether or not the taxes had been deposited, and if not, urged the Lettermans to make the deposits.  Each time he raised the issue with the Lettermans, they promised to pay the taxes, and Vinick relied on their assurances.  Beginning in April 1989, Jefferson Bronze again fell behind in its withholding tax obligations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1990, the IRS made an assessment against Vinick and Letterman, each in the amount of $49,129 for unpaid withholding taxes for the last three quarters of 1989 and the first two quarters of 1990.  Vinick paid one quarter's worth of the assessment, filed a claim for a refund, and upon IRS denial, brought a refund suit in district court.  The IRS counterclaimed for the balance of the assessment and moved for summary judgment against both Letterman and Vinick.  The district court, concluding that both Vinick and Letterman were responsible persons who acted willfully under &#167; 6672(a), granted summary judgment for the IRS.  Vinick alone now appeals.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the award of summary judgment de novo.  See Ortiz-Pinero v.

Summary judgment is appropriate in the absence of a genuine issue of material fact, when the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  A fact is material when it has the potential to affect the outcome of the suit.  See J. Geils Band Employee Benefit Plan v. Smith Barney Shearson, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196588\"><a href=\"/opinion/196588/j-geils-band-v-smith-barney/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1245</span></a></span>, 1250-51 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></span> (1996).  Neither party may rely on conclusory allegations or unsubstantiated denials, but must identify specific facts derived from the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions and affidavits to demonstrate either the existence or absence of an issue of fact.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c) and (e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As in other tax litigation, the person challenging an assessment under &#167; 6672(a) bears the burden of proving that he is not a responsible person.  See Caterino v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"472151\"><a href=\"/opinion/472151/cosmo-j-caterino-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">794</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.1986).  Vinick thus bears the ultimate burden of proving that &#167; 6672(a) does not impose liability on him for Jefferson Bronze's unpaid withholding taxes.  See id.   At the summary judgment stage, however, the IRS, as the moving party, has the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact as to whether &#167; 6672(a) applies and that it deserves judgment as a matter of law.  Vinick's burden, as the party opposing summary judgment, remains the same as any opposing party:  he must demonstrate that disputed facts preclude summary judgment.  See O'Connor v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577206\"><a href=\"/opinion/577206/james-m-oconnor-v-united-states-of-america-third-party-v-richard/\"><span class=\"volume\">956</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span>, 50 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In granting summary judgment in favor of the IRS, the district court determined both that Vinick was a responsible person and that he acted willfully as a matter of law.  We consider each of these issues in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.

Specifically, responsibility \"is a matter of status, duty, and authority,\" Thomsen, 887 F.2d at 16 (internal quotations and citations omitted), aimed at the ultimate determination of \"whether the person had the power to determine whether the taxes should be remitted or paid or had 'the final word as to what bills should or should not be paid and when,' \" Caterino, 794 F.2d at 5 (quoting Adams v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"322175\"><a href=\"/opinion/322175/william-w-adams-v-united-states-of-america-and-third-party-vlakeshore/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">73</span></a></span>, 75 (7th Cir.1974)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We impose responsibility on \"all with the responsibility and authority to avoid the default,\" Harrington v.

As the Second Circuit recently stated, &#167; 6672(a) \"is not meant to ensnare those who have merely technical authority or titular designation,\" but instead encompasses those close enough to the business to prevent the default.  United States v. Rem, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"681002\"><a href=\"/opinion/681002/united-states-v-mary-rem-syma-lichter-and-nathan-hanfling-as-executors/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">634</span></a></span>, 642 (2d Cir.1994).  At bottom, in order to be responsible, an individual must have had significant control over the financial affairs of the company.  See Caterino, 794 F.2d at 5;  see also Rem, 38 F.3d at 642;  United States v. Carrigan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"675707\"><a href=\"/opinion/675707/united-states-v-robert-p-carrigan-david-l-fendrick-and-edward-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span>, 133 (3rd Cir.1994).  The individual assessed either must have exercised his authority over financial affairs or general management, or must have had a duty to do so.  See O'Connor, 956 F.2d at 51.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the absence of uncontroverted evidence establishing an individual's \"precise responsibility\" to pay withholding taxes, see Barnett v.

Such indicia include the holding of corporate office, the authority to disburse corporate funds, stock ownership, and the ability to hire and fire employees.  See Thomsen, 887 F.2d at 16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IRS has offered no evidence suggesting that Vinick had the actual responsibility to pay the withholding taxes.  Indeed, that was Letterman's duty.  As to Vinick, the IRS established some of the recognized indicia of responsibility.  During the quarters in controversy, Vinick held the office of treasurer, prepared the quarterly returns, spoke occasionally with the Lettermans about the business (including the problem of unpaid taxes), had check signing authority, and had pledged his personal assets and guarantee in order to secure company financing.  See Caterino, 794 F.2d at 5-6 (evaluating individual's responsibility during delinquent quarters);  see also Barnett, 988 F.2d at 1455 (same).  From these indicia alone, one might infer that Vinick was a responsible person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record in this case, however, permits a competing inference.  Vinick testified that from the outset of their venture he made it clear to Letterman and Mayer that his role was to be no more than that of a passive investor.  During the relevant quarters, Vinick neither hired nor fired anyone, nor inserted himself into the company structure, initiated change or made strategic decisions.  Although he technically possessed check writing authority, he never possessed the checkbook, nor did he write any checks.  While Vinick did approach Ouellette to run the company when Mayer was dismissed and negotiated a settlement with the IRS in 1985 for delinquent withholding taxes, neither of those incidents occurred during the quarters in question.  Letterman, in his deposition, claimed that previous managers had indicated that Vinick had more than minimal involvement in management.  Letterman admitted, however, that after he took over Vinick's involvement was minimal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, while the record in this case may contain sufficient evidence from which one could infer Vinick's responsibility as a matter of fact, \"[t]he sufficiency of the government's evidence was not the proper test on a motion for summary judgment.\"  Rem, 38 F.3d at 645.   In reversing the district court on this issue we by no means absolve Vinick or in any way pass on whether he is or is not responsible under &#167; 6672(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  We simply conclude that on the basis of the evidence before us, a reasonable jury could find that Vinick was not a responsible person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Willfulness under &#167; 6672(a)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming a jury finds Vinick a responsible person under &#167; 6672(a), a predicate to the question of willfulness, we affirm the district court's conclusion that the undisputed facts establish that Vinick acted willfully as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 6672(a) contemplates a civil penalty the purpose of which is to protect governmental revenue.  See Thomsen, 887 F.2d at 17.   Willfulness under &#167; 6672(a), therefore, does not depend on the presence of either criminal motive or the specific intent to defraud the government.  See id.   Instead, an individual who acts with a \"reckless disregard\" of a known or obvious risk of nonpayment acts willfully.  See id. at 18.   We have recognized three factual scenarios that meet this standard:  (1) reliance upon the statements of a person in control of the finances when the circumstances show that the responsible person knew the person to be unreliable;  (2) failure to investigate or to correct mismanagement after having notice of nonpayment of withholding taxes;  and (3) knowing that the business is in financial trouble and continuing to pay other creditors without making reasonable inquiry as to the status of the withholding taxes.

Should the \"responsible person\" continue to delegate, without taking appropriate measures to assure that the delegated person will not repeat the dereliction in the future, the subsequent willfulness of the delegatee in once more failing to pay the taxes will be imputed to the \"responsible person.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The undisputed facts establish that as early as 1985 Vinick knew of Letterman's unreliability with respect to the withholding taxes.  Vinick admitted that Letterman refused to accompany him to a meeting with a revenue agent after the first delinquency.  Letterman and Ouellette waited in the car while Vinick negotiated a payment plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Vinick also admitted that after Letterman took over day-to-day management of Jefferson Bronze, he had discussions with either Letterman or Letterman's wife whenever he prepared a quarterly return.  On those occasions, Vinick urged the Lettermans to pay the taxes and they promised they would.  Vinick asserted that while he had knowledge of the unpaid taxes, his absolute lack of any control over the disbursement of funds rendered that knowledge meaningless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While such knowledge may not bear on Vinick's &#167; 6672(a) responsibility, should a jury find him responsible, it relates directly to a proper evaluation of whether he acted willfully.  Vinick concedes that he knew of Letterman's delinquency.  Yet Vinick relied on Letterman's promises of future payment without further investigation even though he realized that the delinquency continued.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Thus, should Vinick be found to be a responsible party, the willfulness prong has been met.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reverse the district court's determination that Vinick was a responsible person as a matter of law, but affirm the court's conclusion that Vinick acted willfully.  We remand this case to the district court for further proceedings on the issue of responsibility, and note that should a jury find Vinick responsible, he acted willfully as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Peter Mayer is Letterman's brother-in-law</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The record reflects that in 1992, Letterman was disbarred after he pled guilty to four counts of larceny and one count of embezzlement by a fiduciary, charges all unrelated to Jefferson Bronze.

In O'Connor, the Fourth Circuit reversed the award of summary judgment for the IRS against a corporate vice president who, like Vinick, averred that the record did not establish his responsibility as a matter of law.  See id. at 52.   The district court granted summary judgment on the basis that O'Connor demonstrated many of the indicia of a responsible person:  he was a founder, fifty percent owner, officer and director of the company;  he had the authority to sign checks;  he had a general familiarity with the financial affairs of the company.  See O'Connor v. United States, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">64479</span></span>, at * 4 (D.Md.). In reversing, the Fourth Circuit concluded that the absence of evidence suggesting that O'Connor either exercised any authority over financial affairs or general management, or was under a duty to do so, precluded the entry of summary judgment and left for trial the issue of O'Connor's actual level of involvement in the company.  Id. at 50-52</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Unlike Thomsen, where we affirmed the district court's grant of a judgment as a matter of law for the IRS, this case presents a very different factual scenario.  In Thomsen, in addition to various indicia of responsibility, we identified \"concrete indications of Thomsen's actual authority.\"  887 F.2d at 16-17.   Thomsen affirmatively made the decision to close the business and took possession of the corporate books, records and remaining inventory.  See id. at 17</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Although Vinick made no arguments, either in his brief or at oral argument, specific to willfulness separate from responsibility, he could argue that he did not act willfully at least during the first quarter in which Jefferson Bronze went delinquent.  The previous events, such as Letterman's 1985 refusal to meet with a revenue agent and Vinick's knowledge that Letterman, on occasion, subsequently failed to pay, necessarily gave Vinick the \"knowledge that [Letterman] had in the past failed to perform adequately with regard to the financial affairs\" of Jefferson Bronze.
