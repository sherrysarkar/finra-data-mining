DELACRUZ, A/K/A LONNIE DELACRUZ,\r\n\n            Defendant, Appellant.\r\n\n                                \r\n\nAPPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n          FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\r\n\n   [Hon. Gene Carter, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                                \r\n\n                   Before\r\n\n           Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n      Selya and Stahl, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n                                \r\n\nJohn D. Pelletier and Goodspeed &amp; O'Donnell on brief for appellant.\r\nJay P. McCloskey, United States Attorney, Margaret D. McGaughey and\r\nJonathan A. Toof, Assistant United States Attorneys, on brief for\r\nappellee.\r\n\n                                \r\n\n              April 21, 1998\r\n                                \r\n\nPer Curiam.  Upon careful review of the briefs and record,\r\nwe conclude that the district court applied the proper standard\r\nin determining that defendant was not entitled to a downward\r\ndeparture for aberrant behavior.  See United States v.\r\nGrandmaison, 77 F.3d 555, 560-61 (1st Cir. 1996).  We base this\r\nconclusion on the record and ruling as a whole; we will not\r\ntake parts of the district court's comments out of context. \r\nFurther, in the circumstances that defendant committed the\r\noffense conduct repeatedly during an extended drug trafficking\r\nenterprise, the district court's discretionary denial of the\r\ndeparture is not subject to further appellate scrutiny.  Seeid. at 561.\r\nWe also perceive no clear error in the determination that\r\ndefendant, who received a 2-level adjustment for her \"minor\"\r\nrole in the offense, was not entitled to an additional\r\nadjustment for \"minimal\" participation.  See U.S.S.G. \r\n3B1.2(a).  On the admitted facts here, we cannot say as a\r\nmatter of law that defendant's repeated conduct was merely\r\n\"minimal,\" as opposed to \"minor.\"  See United States v. Cruz,\r\n120 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1997) (en banc); United States v.\r\nGraciani, 61 F.3d 70, 75 (1st Cir. 1995) (explaining that,\r\n\"absent a mistake of law, battles over a defendant's status .\r\n. . will almost always be won or lost in the district court\").\r\nAffirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r\n- Dissenting opinion follows -\r\nTorruella, Chief Judge, dissenting in part.  I dissent as\r\nto the adjustment for defendant's role in the offense.  In my\r\nview, the district court clearly erred in finding that\r\ndefendant was not entitled to a 4-level adjustment under\r\nU.S.S.G.  3B1.2(a) for her \"minimal\" role.  The pre-sentence\r\nreport described defendant's involvement as follows:\r\nThe defendant readily admitted her\r\ninvolvement in the offense.  She explained\r\nthat she first learned of her husband's\r\ndrug dealing when he handed her the\r\ntelephone and asked her to translate for\r\nhim.  When she realized what he had asked\r\nher to do, she reportedly argued with him. \r\nShe stated that while she knew her husband\r\nwas dealing drugs, she wanted no part of\r\nit and did not knowingly allow drugs in\r\nher home.  She stated that she insisted\r\nthat he not bring drug purchasers to their\r\napartment.  She described her role as only\r\nthat of a translator for her husband\r\nbecause his English was not very good. \r\nShe estimated that she acted in this\r\ncapacity on about 10 occasions over the\r\ncourse of two to three years.  She added\r\nthat she did not want to be involved but\r\nfelt somewhat pressured to translate for\r\nher husband as he would get frustrated and\r\nyell at her to take the phone from him\r\nwhile he was discussing drug deals on the\r\nphone.  She asserted that she never made\r\nany trips with him to sell the drugs and\r\nwas never given any money by him for her\r\nrole.  The defendant also points out that\r\nshe promptly notified the authorities when\r\nher husband absconded and that she\r\nencouraged her mother to assist in efforts\r\nto locate him.\r\nAccordingly, I would reverse and remand for resentencing.\r\n",
