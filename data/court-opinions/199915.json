This is a dispute arising\n\nunder the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. §§ 201-19.\n\nThe plaintiffs-appellees, campus police officers at Northeastern\n\nUniversity, sued their employer to recover overtime payment for\n\ntime they spent in classes for certification as emergency medical\n\ntechnicians (EMTs).      On cross-motions for summary judgment, the\n\ndistrict court ruled in favor of the employees and awarded damages.\n\n          The employer appealed the finding of liability, arguing\n\nthat our precedent applying the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947, 29\n\nU.S.C. §§ 251-62, forecloses liability in this case.        We agree and\nreverse the judgment of the district court with instructions to\n\nenter judgment in favor of the employer.\n\n                   I.   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n          The parties submitted cross-motions for summary judgment\nbased on the following set of stipulated facts:\n          Plaintiffs-appellees,       Karen    Lynn   Bienkowski,   David\n\nEberle, Delia Ann Hoye, and Edward McDonald, were at all relevant\ntimes employed as police officers for the defendant, Northeastern\nUniversity, and were compensated on an hourly basis.\n          Defendant-appellant             Northeastern       University\n\n(Northeastern) is a private not-for-profit university located in\n\nBoston, Massachusetts.\n\n          As   a   condition   of   employment,   Northeastern   required\n\nBienkowski, Eberle, Hoye, and McDonald to receive and retain\n\ncertification as Massachusetts-registered EMTs within one year of\n\ntheir appointment as probationary police officers. At the time the\n\n                                    -2-\n\fplaintiffs were hired as police officers, they were required to\n\nsign a letter acknowledging that: \"[e]mployees must receive and\n\nretain    certification   as    a   Massachusetts    registered   emergency\nmedical technician within one year of appointment.\"           The training\n\nfor which the plaintiffs seek compensation occurred during their\n\nprobationary periods.        They performed no EMT services prior to\nreceiving their certifications.\n\n            Pursuant to Massachusetts statutes, regulations, and\n\nDepartment of Public Health standards, initial certification as an\n\nEMT requires approximately 110 hours of classroom work as well as\n\n10 hours of in-hospital observation time, practical exams, and\n\nwritten exams.    Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 111C, § 9; Mass. Regs. Code\n\ntit. 105, §§ 170.810, 170.910.         This certification is good for two\nyears.     To maintain certification after two years, EMTs must\n\ncomplete additional refresher training.\n\n            Courses leading to EMT certification were offered at\nvarious    locations   and     times    throughout   the   Commonwealth   of\n\nMassachusetts.    Northeastern also offered the EMT courses.\n\n            In order to fulfill the foregoing requirements, the\n\nplaintiffs attended EMT courses from January 7, 1997, through\n\nApril 3, 1997.    In addition, all of the plaintiffs completed 10\n\nhours of in-hospital observation, attended EMT review classes, took\n\nthe EMT practical exam, and sat for the EMT written exam.                 The\n\nplaintiffs elected to take the courses at Northeastern, where they\n\nwere entitled to tuition remission.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\f            For the majority of the time, the classes, in-hospital\n\nobservations, and exams occurred outside of the plaintiffs' regular\n\nworking hours.    The plaintiffs performed no work for Northeastern\nwhile they attended these classes.                  Following their certification\n\nas EMTs, the plaintiffs were required to provide copies of their\n\ncertifications to Northeastern.\n            Pursuant    to        a    collective       bargaining   agreement,        each\n\nplaintiff    received        an       $850   stipend       on   receipt    of    the     EMT\n\ncertification.      Other than this stipend, the plaintiffs received\n\nno   compensation      for     attending          the     EMT   courses,    in-hospital\n\nobservations, or time spent taking examinations.                           Northeastern\n\ncompensated the plaintiffs only for those hours when the classes,\n\nin-hospital observations or exams took place during the plaintiffs'\nworking hours.\n\n            Following their certification as EMTs, the plaintiffs\n\nused their EMT skills while on the job at Northeastern. Bienkowski\nrecalled handling various medical emergencies, such as broken feet,\n\nheart attacks, diabetic shock, and sports injuries. Prior to their\n\ncertification, the plaintiffs performed no EMT work.\n\n            Following their certification as EMTs, Northeastern once\n\nor twice a week assigned the plaintiffs to be attendants or drivers\n\non   its   ambulances    as       part       of   their    regular   paid       duties    as\n\nNortheastern police officers.                Under Massachusetts law, one has to\n\nbe a certified EMT to work on an ambulance.                      Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n\n111C, § 9.\n\n\n\n\n                                             -4-\n\f            The district court, concluding that the time spent in EMT\n\ntraining was an integral and indispensable part of the principal\n\nactivities for which covered workers are employed, ruled in favor\nof the plaintiffs on their overtime claims under the FLSA.      In a\n\nlater ruling, the court found that the FLSA violation was not\n\nwillful and, therefore, did not warrant the imposition of multiple\ndamages.    This appeal followed.\n\n                            II.     ANALYSIS\n\nA.   Standard of review\n\n            A motion for summary judgment can only be allowed if \"the\npleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions\non file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is\nno genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party\n\nis entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"      Fed. R. Civ. P.\n56(c).     In ruling on the motion the district court must view \"the\nfacts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, drawing\n\nall reasonable inferences in that party's favor.\"         Barbour v.\n\nDynamics Research Corp., 63 F.3d 32, 36 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n            The standards are the same where, as here, both parties\nhave moved for summary judgment. \"The court must rule on each\n\nparty's motion on an individual and separate basis, determining,\n\nfor each side, whether a judgment may be entered in accordance with\n\nthe Rule 56 standard.\"    10A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller\n\n& Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2720, at 335-36\n\n(3d ed. 1998).\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f           On appeal, we review the district court's ruling on\n\ncross-motions   for   summary    judgment   de   novo.   Wightman   v.\n\nSpringfield Term. Ry. Co., 100 F.3d 228, 230 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\nB.   Portal-to-Portal Act\n\n           The FLSA requires employers to compensate employees for\n\nall \"hours worked.\"    29 U.S.C. § 201.      However, the Portal-to-\n\nPortal Act provides, in part, that an employer need not pay an\n\nemployee for activities that are \"preliminary or postliminary\" to\n\nthe principal activity or activities the employee is employed to\n\nperform.   Id. § 254(a)(2).     The Supreme Court has interpreted the\nmandate of the Portal-to-Portal Act to mean that \"that activities\n\nperformed either before or after the regular work shift, on or off\nthe production line, are compensable . . . if those activities are\nan integral and indispensable part of the principal activities for\n\nwhich covered workmen are employed.\" Steiner v. Mitchell, 350 U.S.\n\n247, 256 (1956).\n           In arguing that the district court erroneously concluded\n\nthat EMT training was an integral and indispensable part of the\nplaintiffs' work as Northeastern police officers, the defendant\nplaces great emphasis on a decision of this court, Ballou v.\n\nGeneral Electric Company, 433 F.2d 109, 111 (1st Cir. 1970).\n           In Ballou, apprentices in a program run by the employer\n\nsought compensation for time spent attending classes conducted off-\n\nsite by independent educational institutions. The apprentices were\nrequired by their employment contracts to prepare for, attend, and\n\nmake satisfactory progress in these classes.        An apprentice who\n\n                                   -6-\n\ffailed to keep these conditions was subject to dismissal.         For the\n\nmost part, the off-site classwork did not relate directly to the\n\nskills apprentices received in on-the-job training; its approach\nwas more theoretical, providing the apprentices with an academic\n\nunderstanding of the skills they were developing.          Id. at 110.\n\n            We concluded in Ballou that the time spent in such\nclasses was not compensable.       We rejected the notion that the\n\ntraining was integral and indispensable to the employees' principal\n\nactivities simply because the employee could be terminated for\n\nfailing to complete it in a satisfactory manner.          Id. at 111.    We\n\nnoted also that, under settled Supreme Court precedent, employers\n\nwho furnished training to potential employees were not required\n\nunder the FLSA to compensate trainees for time spent in the\ntraining program.    Id. (citing Walling v. Portland Terminal Co.,\n\n330 U.S. 148 (1947), and Walling v. Nashville, Chattanooga & St.\n\nLouis Ry., 330 U.S. 158 (1947)).        Because these cases required\nindividuals to be compensated only for their activity as workers,\n\nrather than as students, we concluded that the employer's decision\nto hire its employees before the completion of training did not\n\nobligate it to compensate them for the time spent in their status\n\nas students after their hiring.     Id. at 112.\n\n            We find our reasoning in Ballou dispositive in this case\n\nas well.    Here there is no question that, during the EMT training\n\nsessions,   the   employees   perform   no   productive    work   for   the\n\nemployer.    Nor is there any question that, rather than providing\n\nsuch training to its employees during their period of probationary\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\femployment,     Northeastern      could      simply    make     the    successful\n\nattainment of an EMT certificate a precondition of employment.\n\nThus, we will not hold Northeastern liable for overtime pay for\ntime its employees spend as students, rather than as workers,\n\nsimply because Northeastern has decided to hire its employees on a\n\nprobationary basis until they complete the training required to\nhold the job on a permanent basis.\n\n           Plaintiffs respond that despite Ballou, the training is\n\ncompensable    under     the   Department      of   Labor    (DOL)    regulations\n\nimplementing the FLSA.         Once of those regulations, 29 C.F.R. §\n\n785.27, makes training non-compensable if, inter alia, it is both\n\nvoluntary and unrelated to the employee's job -- conditions that do\n\nnot appear to be satisfied here.            But we doubt that the regulation\nwas meant to cover the peculiar situation presented here -- that\n\nis, where the training is not continuing education relating to\n\nexisting job duties, but instead a pre-condition for employment\nwhich the employer tolerantly allows to be satisfied while the\n\nemployee is working on a probationary basis.                And in the event the\n\nregulation was intended to apply to such situations, it would be\n\ninconsistent with Ballou's reading of the statute and precedent.\n\n           The plaintiffs also attempt to distinguish Ballou on the\n\nground that it involved an apprenticeship program, which receives\n\nseparate treatment under the DOL regulations.                  See 29 C.F.R. §\n\n785.32.1      Although    we   noted   in    Ballou   that    the     regulation's\n\n1\n    29 C.F.R. § 785.32 provides:\n\n      As an enforcement policy, time spent in an organized\n\n                                       -8-\n\fapprenticeship provision \"bolstered\" our holding, 433 F.2d at 112,\n\nwe   gave   no   indication   that   our    conclusion   depended   upon   it.\n\nInstead, our holding in Ballou relies on the statutory language of\n\nthe Portal-to-Portal Act and the controlling decisions interpreting\n\nthe provisions of the FLSA.\n\n             Because the time spent by the plaintiffs in EMT training\nis   not    an   integral   and   indispensable   part   of   the   principal\n\nactivities for which they are employed, we conclude that the\n\nPortal-to-Portal Act precludes a finding of liability on the part\n\nof   Northeastern.\n\n                              III.   CONCLUSION\n\n             The judgment of the district court is reversed, and the\n\ncase is remanded with instructions to enter judgment in favor of\n\nthe defendant.\n\n\n\n\n      program of related, supplemental instruction by employees\n      working under bona fide apprenticeship programs may be\n      excluded from working time if the following criteria are\n      met:\n      (a) The apprentice is employed under a written\n      apprenticeship agreement or program which substantially\n      meets the fundamental standards of the Bureau of\n      Apprenticeship and Training of the U.S. Department of\n      Labor; and\n      (b) Such time does not involve productive work or\n      performance of the apprentice's regular duties. If the\n      above criteria are met the time spent in such related\n      supplemental training shall not be counted as hours\n      worked unless the written agreement specifically provides\n      that it is hours worked. The mere payment or agreement to\n      pay for time spent in related instruction does not\n      constitute an agreement that such time is hours worked.\n\n                                      -9-\n\f",

In a\n\nlater ruling, the court found that the FLSA violation was not\n\nwillful and, therefore, did not warrant the imposition of multiple\ndamages.

Portal-to-Portal Act\n\n           The FLSA requires employers to compensate employees for\n\nall \"hours worked.\"    29 U.S.C. § 201.      However, the Portal-to-\n\nPortal Act provides, in part, that an employer need not pay an\n\nemployee for activities that are \"preliminary or postliminary\" to\n\nthe principal activity or activities the employee is employed to\n\nperform.   Id. § 254(a)(2).     The Supreme Court has interpreted the\nmandate of the Portal-to-Portal Act to mean that \"that activities\n\nperformed either before or after the regular work shift, on or off\nthe production line, are compensable . . . if those activities are\nan integral and indispensable part of the principal activities for\n\nwhich covered workmen are employed.\" Steiner v.

The apprentices were\nrequired by their employment contracts to prepare for, attend, and\n\nmake satisfactory progress in these classes.        An apprentice who\n\n                                   -6-\n\ffailed to keep these conditions was subject to dismissal.         For the\n\nmost part, the off-site classwork did not relate directly to the\n\nskills apprentices received in on-the-job training; its approach\nwas more theoretical, providing the apprentices with an academic\n\nunderstanding of the skills they were developing.          Id. at 110.\n\n            We concluded in Ballou that the time spent in such\nclasses was not compensable.       We rejected the notion that the\n\ntraining was integral and indispensable to the employees' principal\n\nactivities simply because the employee could be terminated for\n\nfailing to complete it in a satisfactory manner.          Id. at 111.    We\n\nnoted also that, under settled Supreme Court precedent, employers\n\nwho furnished training to potential employees were not required\n\nunder the FLSA to compensate trainees for time spent in the\ntraining program.    Id. (citing Walling v. Portland Terminal Co.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104376\"><a href=\"/opinion/104376/walling-v-portland-terminal-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1947), and Walling v. Nashville, Chattanooga & St.\n\nLouis Ry., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104377\"><a href=\"/opinion/104377/walling-v-nashville-c-st-lr-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">158</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1947)).        Because these cases required\nindividuals to be compensated only for their activity as workers,\n\nrather than as students, we concluded that the employer's decision\nto hire its employees before the completion of training did not\n\nobligate it to compensate them for the time spent in their status\n\nas students after their hiring.     Id. at 112.\n\n            We find our reasoning in Ballou dispositive in this case\n\nas well.    Here there is no question that, during the EMT training\n\nsessions,   the   employees   perform   no   productive    work   for   the\n\nemployer.    Nor is there any question that, rather than providing\n\nsuch training to its employees during their period of probationary\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\femployment,     Northeastern      could      simply    make     the    successful\n\nattainment of an EMT certificate a precondition of employment.\n\nThus, we will not hold Northeastern liable for overtime pay for\ntime its employees spend as students, rather than as workers,\n\nsimply because Northeastern has decided to hire its employees on a\n\nprobationary basis until they complete the training required to\nhold the job on a permanent basis.\n\n           Plaintiffs respond that despite Ballou, the training is\n\ncompensable    under     the   Department      of   Labor    (DOL)    regulations\n\nimplementing the FLSA.         Once of those regulations, 29 C.F.R. §\n\n785.27, makes training non-compensable if, inter alia, it is both\n\nvoluntary and unrelated to the employee's job -- conditions that do\n\nnot appear to be satisfied here.            But we doubt that the regulation\nwas meant to cover the peculiar situation presented here -- that\n\nis, where the training is not continuing education relating to\n\nexisting job duties, but instead a pre-condition for employment\nwhich the employer tolerantly allows to be satisfied while the\n\nemployee is working on a probationary basis.                And in the event the\n\nregulation was intended to apply to such situations, it would be\n\ninconsistent with Ballou's reading of the statute and precedent.\n\n           The plaintiffs also attempt to distinguish Ballou on the\n\nground that it involved an apprenticeship program, which receives\n\nseparate treatment under the DOL regulations.                  See 29 C.F.R. §\n\n785.32.1      Although    we   noted   in    Ballou   that    the     regulation's\n\n1\n    29 C.F.R. § 785.32 provides:\n\n      As an enforcement policy, time spent in an organized\n\n                                       -8-\n\fapprenticeship provision \"bolstered\" our holding, 433 F.2d at 112,\n\nwe   gave   no   indication   that   our    conclusion   depended   upon   it.\n\nInstead, our holding in Ballou relies on the statutory language of\n\nthe Portal-to-Portal Act and the controlling decisions interpreting\n\nthe provisions of the FLSA.\n\n             Because the time spent by the plaintiffs in EMT training\nis   not    an   integral   and   indispensable   part   of   the   principal\n\nactivities for which they are employed, we conclude that the\n\nPortal-to-Portal Act precludes a finding of liability on the part\n\nof   Northeastern.\n\n                              III.   CONCLUSION\n\n             The judgment of the district court is reversed, and the\n\ncase is remanded with instructions to enter judgment in favor of\n\nthe defendant.\n\n\n\n\n      program of related, supplemental instruction by employees\n      working under bona fide apprenticeship programs may be\n      excluded from working time if the following criteria are\n      met:\n      (a) The apprentice is employed under a written\n      apprenticeship agreement or program which substantially\n      meets the fundamental standards of the Bureau of\n      Apprenticeship and Training of the U.S. Department of\n      Labor; and\n      (b) Such time does not involve productive work or\n      performance of the apprentice's regular duties. If the\n      above criteria are met the time spent in such related\n      supplemental training shall not be counted as hours\n      worked unless the written agreement specifically provides\n      that it is hours worked. The mere payment or agreement to\n      pay for time spent in related instruction does not\n      constitute an agreement that such time is hours worked.\n\n                                      -9-\n\f</pre>",
