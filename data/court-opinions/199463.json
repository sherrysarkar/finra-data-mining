Sanchez Maceira, by Appointment of the Court, for\nappellant.\n     Jared Lopez, Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom Guillermo\nGil, United States Attorney, Jorge E. Vega-Pacheco, Assistant\nU.S. Attorney, and Thomas F. Klumper, Assistant U.S. Attorney,\nwere on brief, for appellee.\n\fJune 27, 2001\n\f    COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.           Appellant Pedro Luis Tejada\n\nseeks dismissal of his indictment for illegal reentry into the\n\nUnited States, see 8 U.S.C. § 1326(b)(2), on the ground that the\n\ngovernment failed to bring him before a magistrate judge within\n\n48 hours following his warrantless arrest, in violation of\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 5(a).1              The district court\n\nconcluded      that   Rule   5(a)     was   inapplicable      to   Tejada's\n\ncircumstances because he was arrested for an immigration-related\n\n\"status offense\" – and thus was civilly detained – rather than\n\nfor a general crime whose elements do not include alien status.\n\nThe district court ruled correctly, and we therefore affirm the\n\ndenial    of   appellant's   motion    to   dismiss.     We   also   reject\n\nTejada's related contention that the district court improperly\n\nrevoked his term of supervised release.\n\n                         I. Factual Background\n\n\n\n    1    In relevant part, Rule 5(a) states:\n\n    Except as otherwise provided in this rule, an officer\n    making an arrest under a warrant issued upon a\n    complaint or any person making an arrest without a\n    warrant shall take the arrested person without\n    unnecessary delay before the nearest available federal\n    magistrate judge or [other authorized judicial\n    officer].\n\nThe requirement that such an appearance generally take place\nwithin 48 hours stems from the Fourth Amendment, not Rule 5(a),\nbut the two contexts typically are treated alike. See United\nStates v. Encarnacion, 239 F.3d 395, 398 n.2 (lst Cir. 2001).\n\n                                    -3-\n\f    In February 1998, appellant was deported to the Dominican\n\nRepublic following his conviction on a federal drug charge.                 Ten\n\nmonths later, on December 20, he flew into Carolina, Puerto\n\nRico, and was detained by inspectors for the Immigration and\n\nNaturalization Service (INS) on suspicion that he had unlawfully\n\nentered the United States.        On December 22, during an interview\n\nwith INS Inspectors Jerry Morales and Fernando Ruz, appellant\n\nacknowledged his previous conviction and deportation.                  Morales\n\nordered appellant's immigration records (the \"A File\"), which\n\ncontained     documents     confirming       the    earlier        deportation\n\nproceedings, and upon receiving the file, he referred the case\n\nto the U.S. Attorney's office for consideration of criminal\n\ncharges.\n\n    On     January   5,   1999,   sixteen    days   after     he    first   was\n\ndetained, appellant was brought before a magistrate judge for an\n\ninitial appearance.2      He subsequently was indicted on one count\n\nof violating 8 U.S.C. § 1326(b)(2), which bars unauthorized\n\nreentry into the United States by an individual previously\n\ndeported for an aggravated felony.          After unsuccessfully seeking\n\ndismissal based on a violation of Rule 5(a), appellant pled\n\n\n    2 In an affidavit, INS Inspector Morales stated that he did\nnot receive the A File until \"about January 5, 1999.\" It thus\nappears that appellant was brought before the magistrate judge\non the same day, or shortly after, Morales obtained the\ndocumentary proof of his prior deportation.\n\n                                    -4-\n\fguilty and was sentenced.        In a related proceeding, the district\n\ncourt revoked the supervised release term that appellant had\n\nreceived in the drug case that had triggered his deportation.\n\nHe was sentenced to a six-month term in lieu of supervised\n\nreleased, to be served consecutively to the fifty-one month\n\nsentence imposed for the illegal reentry.\n\n     On appeal, appellant renews his challenge under Rule 5(a),\n\nclaiming   that   the   court    erred    in    refusing   to   dismiss   the\n\nindictment with prejudice.         In addition, because revocation of\n\nhis supervised release term resulted from his conviction under\n\n§   1326(b)(2),   he    claims     that   the    release    term   must    be\n\nreinstated.   For reasons we explain below, both contentions are\n\nunavailing.\n\n                              II. Discussion\n\n     As his counsel acknowledged at oral argument, Tejada's\n\nappeal lost most of its force when a panel of this court ruled\n\nearlier this year that § 1326(b)(2) is a status offense that\n\ndoes not trigger the protections of Rule 5(a) until the criminal\n\nprocess has been initiated against the detained alien.                    See\n\nUnited States v. Encarnacion, 239 F.3d 395, 399 (lst Cir. 2001);\n\nsee also United States v. Noel, 231 F.3d 833, 837 (11 th Cir.\n\n2000) (per curiam); United States v. Cepeda-Luna, 989 F.2d 353,\n\n358 (9th Cir. 1993).    The   requirement that a magistrate evaluate\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fhis   detention   within     48   hours   of   his   arrest       is   therefore\n\ninapplicable.     Instead, his detention was civil in nature and\n\ngoverned by 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(2), see Encarnacion, 239 F.3d at\n\n398-400, which empowers INS officials to effect a warrantless\n\narrest of\n\n      any alien who in [their] presence or view is entering\n      or attempting to enter the United States in violation\n      of any law or regulation made in pursuance of law\n      regulating the admission, exclusion, expulsion, or\n      removal of aliens . . . .\n\nAn alien detained under that provision must be taken \"without\n\nunnecessary delay for examination before an officer of the [INS]\n\nhaving authority to examine aliens as to their right to enter or\n\nremain in the United States.\" Id.3             Thus, to comply with the\n\napplicable statute, the arresting authorities needed to bring\n\nappellant   to    an   IRS   examining    officer,    not     a    magistrate,\n\n\"without unnecessary delay.\"\n\n      Appellant was interviewed two days after his arrest by INS\n\nInspectors Morales and Ruz.           Although he baldly asserts on\n\n\n      3Another subsection of § 1357 allows INS officers to make\narrests for immigration-related felonies and requires that the\nalien be taken promptly before \"the nearest available officer\nempowered to commit persons charged with offenses against the\nlaws of the United States . . . .\" 8 U.S.C. § 1357(a)(4).\nCourts have read subsection (a)(2) to apply to arrests of aliens\nfor status offenses and subsection (a)(4) to apply to arrests of\naliens for other crimes.    Encarnacion, 239 F.3d at 398.     In\nturn, Rule 5(a) is considered applicable to subsection (a)(4)\ndetainees, but not to those detained under subsection (a)(2).\nId. at 398-99.\n\n                                    -6-\n\fappeal that this timing did not comply with the statute and\n\nviolated his due process rights, he failed to make that claim to\n\nthe district court,         see District Court Opinion at 6, or to\n\ndevelop    it   on    appeal.    We   therefore      need   not   address      the\n\nspecific question whether appellant's appearance before the INS\n\noccurred    \"without        unnecessary     delay\"    as     mandated     by     §\n\n1357(a)(2).     We think it beyond debate, however, that the period\n\nat issue – approximately the same time            permitted by Rule 5(a)4\n\n– did not constitute a deprivation of rights that warrants our\n\nintervention, particularly in the absence of a preserved claim.\n\n    We nonetheless wish to note that aliens arrested for status\n\noffenses    are      not   without   protection   from      excessively     long\n\ndetentions.       Where the government uses civil detention as a\n\npretext for holding an individual while it investigates other\n\npossible criminal charges, Rule 5(a) may be deemed applicable,\n\nsee Encarnacion, 239 F.3d at 399-400; cf. Noel, 231 F.3d at 836\n\n(\"Although routine INS detentions incident to deportation do not\n\ntrigger the Speedy Trial Act, a contrary result may be warranted\n\nwhen detentions are used by the government, not to effectuate\n\ndeportation, but rather as 'mere ruses to detain a defendant for\n\n\n\n    4 At argument, the government indicated that appellant was\narrested in the early morning hours of December 20 and brought\nbefore the INS officers later in the morning of December 22,\nseveral hours beyond the 48-hour time period.\n\n                                      -7-\n\flater criminal prosecution.'\" (quoting Cepeda-Luna, 989 F.2d at\n\n357)); United States v. De La Pena-Juarez, 214 F.3d 594, 598 (5th\n\nCir. 2000) (applying Speedy Trial Act only \"where the defendant\n\ndemonstrates that the primary or exclusive purpose of the civil\n\ndetention was to hold him for future criminal prosecution\");\n\nCepeda-Luna, 989 F.2d at 358.5    In addition, where the delay in\n\nbringing the alien before a magistrate is so unnecessarily long\n\nthat it effects a constitutional deprivation, the alien may\n\npetition for habeas corpus relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2241, see\n\nEncarnacion, 239 F.3d at 399 n.4; Cepeda-Luna, 989 F.2d at 358.6\n\n\n     5 We note that appellant did not raise a claim under the\nSpeedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 3161-3174. The Act provides, in\npertinent part:\n\n     Any information or indictment charging an individual\n     with the commission of an offense shall be filed\n     within 30 days from the date on which such individual\n     was arrested or served with a summons in connection\n     with such charges.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3161(b).    Some courts have held that the clock\nstarts to run from the date of the civil arrest when the\nadministrative and criminal charges against the defendant are\nidentical. See, e.g., United States v. Restrepo, 59 F. Supp. 2d\n133, 137 (D. Mass. 1999); United States v. Vasquez-Escobar, 30\nF. Supp.2d 1364, 1367 (M.D. Fla. 1998); United States v. Okuda,\n675 F. Supp. 1552, 1555 (D. Haw. 1987).\n     6Appellant's lawyer asserted at oral argument that it would\nbe difficult for an alien to obtain counsel to bring such claims\nbecause there is no right to counsel in civil habeas\nproceedings. Not all aliens will lack resources, however, and\nthose unable to hire counsel may, as in other settings, seek pro\nbono representation. In any event, it is our hope that what we\nsay here about the appropriate length of civil detentions, see\n\n                                 -8-\n\f      In this case, there is no evidence that appellant initially\n\nwas detained for any reason other than routine inquiry into his\n\nsuspicious immigration status – a civil matter, see Encarnacion,\n\n239   F.3d   at    399   –    and     his    confession         two   days       later   to\n\nimmigration officials confirmed his unlawful status.                              At that\n\npoint, appellant's circumstances were in many respects identical\n\nto those we described in Encarnacion:\n\n      His interview with [INS Officers Ruz and Morales],\n      mandated by the \"taken without unnecessary delay . .\n      . before an officer of the [INS]\" language of §\n      1357(a)(2), amplified the INS's suspicions that\n      [appellant's] attempted entry was unlawful. But only\n      after receiving the INS file on [appellant] containing\n      the prior deportation order had     [Ruz and Morales]\n      secured the \"probable cause\" necessary to initiate the\n      criminal process under the applicable law and\n      regulations. . . . Consequently, [appellant's] case\n      did not become criminal until [Morales's] contact with\n      the U.S. Attorney, and after that point, [appellant]\n      was   brought   expeditiously   before   the   federal\n      magistrate judge.\n\nId. (emphasis in original).\n\n      We   acknowledge       that     appellant's         situation     differs       from\n\nEncarnacion's      in    that    it    took       twice    as    long       to   transmit\n\nappellant's       file   to     Inspector         Morales       as    the    period      we\n\n\ninfra pp. 7-8, will prompt more expeditious action by the INS.\nMoreover, we agree with the district court that in cases of\n\"lengthy yet lawful civil detention that may arise from\ninefficient investigation by immigration officers, defendant may\nrequest upon sentencing (if he is convicted or enters a guilty\nplea) that 'any prejudice traceable to the pretrial detention []\nbe mitigated by giving him credit for time served on the INS\ndetainer.'\" District Court Opinion at 13 (citation omitted).\n\n                                            -9-\n\fquestioned as unnecessarily lengthy in     Encarnacion, see id.\n\n(\"[P]rompt action by INS officials (and the availability of\n\ntoday's parcel-delivery services) should make it possible to\n\ntransmit files between INS offices more quickly than seven\n\ndays.\").   Although the days at issue here spanned the winter\n\nholidays, when greater delay is unsurprising, such a lapse of\n\ntime at least borders on excessive in light of the easy access\n\nin most locations to overnight delivery service.\n\n     Yet, in the absence of any evidence that the government\n\ndeliberately employed delaying tactics for an impermissible\n\npurpose, we have no basis in these circumstances for considering\n\nthe matter further.    On the issue before us – whether the\n\ndistrict court wrongly refused to dismiss appellant's case based\n\non a violation of Rule 5(a) – we find no error.7   That conclusion\n\nalso disposes of appellant's challenge to withdrawal of his\n\nsupervised release term, which is based solely on the invalidity\n\nof his conviction under § 1326(b)(2).\n\n     The judgment of the district court is therefore affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     7We note that this court has not yet decided \"whether Rule\n5(a) can ever be a basis for dismissal of an indictment absent\nevidence of unwarranted interrogation during the period of\ndetention.\" Encarnacion, 239 F.3d at 400 n.5.\n\n                              -10-\n\f",

Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1998, appellant was deported to the Dominican Republic following his conviction on a federal drug charge. Ten months later, on December 20, he flew into Carolina, Puerto Rico, and was detained by inspectors for the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) on suspicion that he had unlawfully entered the United States. On December 22, during an interview with INS Inspectors Jerry Morales and Fernando Ruz, appellant acknowledged his previous conviction and deportation. Morales ordered appellant's immigration records (the \"A File\"), which contained documents confirming the earlier deportation proceedings, and upon receiving the file, he referred the case to the U.S. Attorney's office for consideration of criminal charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 5, 1999, sixteen days after he first was detained, appellant was brought before a magistrate judge for an initial appearance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> He subsequently was indicted on one count of violating 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1326(b)(2), which bars unauthorized re-entry into the United States by an individual previously deported for an aggravated felony. After unsuccessfully seeking dismissal based on a violation of Rule 5(a), appellant pled guilty and was sentenced. In a related proceeding, the district court revoked the supervised release term that appellant had received in the drug case that had triggered his deportation. He was sentenced to a six-month term in lieu of supervised released, to be served consecutively to the fifty-one month sentence imposed for the illegal re-entry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, appellant renews his challenge under Rule 5(a), claiming that the court erred in refusing to dismiss the indictment with prejudice. In addition, because revocation of his supervised release term resulted from his conviction under &#167;&#167; 1326(b)(2), he claims that the release term must be reinstated. For reasons we explain below, both contentions are unavailing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As his counsel acknowledged at oral argument, Tejada's appeal lost most of its force when a panel of this court ruled earlier this year that &#167;&#167; 1326(b)(2) is a status offense that does not trigger the protections of Rule 5(a) until the criminal process has been initiated against the detained alien. See United States v. Encarnacion, 239 F.3d 395, 399 (lst Cir. 2001); see also United States v. Noel, 231 F.3d 833, 837 (11th Cir. 2000) (per curiam); United States v. Cepeda-Luna, 989 F.2d 353, 358 (9th Cir. 1993). The requirement that a magistrate evaluate his detention within 48 hours of his arrest is therefore inapplicable. Instead, his detention was civil in nature and governed by 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1357(a)(2), see Encarnacion, 239 F.3d at 398-400, which empowers INS officials to effect a warrantless arrest of</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">any alien who in [their] presence or view is entering or attempting to enter the United States in violation of any law or regulation made in pursuance of law regulating the admission, exclusion, expulsion, or removal of aliens . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An alien detained under that provision must be taken \"without unnecessary delay for examination before an officer of the [INS] having authority to examine aliens as to their right to enter or remain in the United States.\" Id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Thus, to comply with the applicable statute, the arresting authorities needed to bring appellant to an IRS examining officer, not a magistrate, \"without unnecessary delay.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant was interviewed two days after his arrest by INS Inspectors Morales and Ruz.

We therefore need not address the specific question whether appellant's appearance before the INS occurred \"without unnecessary delay\" as mandated by &#167;&#167; 1357(a)(2). We think it beyond debate, however, that the period at issue -approximately the same time permitted by Rule 5(a)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> - did not constitute a deprivation of rights that warrants our intervention, particularly in the absence of a preserved claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We nonetheless wish to note that aliens arrested for status offenses are not without protection from excessively long detentions.

The district court ruled correctly, and we therefore affirm the denial of appellant's motion to dismiss. We also reject Tejada's related contention that the district court improperly revoked his term of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1998, appellant was deported to the Dominican Republic following his conviction on a federal drug charge. Ten months later, on December 20, he flew into Carolina, Puerto Rico, and was detained by inspectors for the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) on suspicion that he had unlawfully entered the United States. On December 22, during an interview with INS Inspectors Jerry Morales and Fernando Ruz, appellant acknowledged his previous conviction and deportation. Morales ordered appellant's immigration records (the \"A File\"), which contained documents confirming the earlier deportation proceedings, and upon receiving the file, he referred the case to the U.S. Attorney's office for consideration of criminal charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 5, 1999, sixteen days after he first was detained, appellant was brought before a magistrate judge for an initial appearance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> He subsequently was indicted on one count of violating 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1326(b)(2), which bars unauthorized re-entry into the United States by an individual previously deported for an aggravated felony. After unsuccessfully seeking dismissal based on a violation of Rule 5(a), appellant pled guilty and was sentenced. In a related proceeding, the district court revoked the supervised release term that appellant had received in the drug case that had triggered his deportation. He was sentenced to a six-month term in lieu of supervised released, to be served consecutively to the fifty-one month sentence imposed for the illegal re-entry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, appellant renews his challenge under Rule 5(a), claiming that the court erred in refusing to dismiss the indictment with prejudice. In addition, because revocation of his supervised release term resulted from his conviction under &#167;&#167; 1326(b)(2), he claims that the release term must be reinstated. For reasons we explain below, both contentions are unavailing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As his counsel acknowledged at oral argument, Tejada's appeal lost most of its force when a panel of this court ruled earlier this year that &#167;&#167; 1326(b)(2) is a status offense that does not trigger the protections of Rule 5(a) until the criminal process has been initiated against the detained alien. See United States v. Encarnacion, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199276\"><a href=\"/opinion/199276/united-states-v-encarnacion/\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">395</span></a></span>, 399 (lst Cir. 2001); see also United States v.

The requirement that a magistrate evaluate his detention within 48 hours of his arrest is therefore inapplicable. Instead, his detention was civil in nature and governed by 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1357(a)(2), see Encarnacion, 239 F.3d at 398-400, which empowers INS officials to effect a warrantless arrest of</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">any alien who in [their] presence or view is entering or attempting to enter the United States in violation of any law or regulation made in pursuance of law regulating the admission, exclusion, expulsion, or removal of aliens . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An alien detained under that provision must be taken \"without unnecessary delay for examination before an officer of the [INS] having authority to examine aliens as to their right to enter or remain in the United States.\" Id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Thus, to comply with the applicable statute, the arresting authorities needed to bring appellant to an IRS examining officer, not a magistrate, \"without unnecessary delay.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant was interviewed two days after his arrest by INS Inspectors Morales and Ruz. Although he baldly asserts on appeal that this timing did not comply with the statute and violated his due process rights, he failed to make that claim to the district court, see District Court Opinion at 6, or to develop it on appeal. We therefore need not address the specific question whether appellant's appearance before the INS occurred \"without unnecessary delay\" as mandated by &#167;&#167; 1357(a)(2). We think it beyond debate, however, that the period at issue -approximately the same time permitted by Rule 5(a)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> - did not constitute a deprivation of rights that warrants our intervention, particularly in the absence of a preserved claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We nonetheless wish to note that aliens arrested for status offenses are not without protection from excessively long detentions.

Not all aliens will lack resources, however, and those unable to hire counsel may, as in other settings, seek pro bono representation. In any event, it is our hope that what we say here about the appropriate length of civil detentions, see infra pp. 7-8, will prompt more expeditious action by the INS. Moreover, we agree with the district court that in cases of \"lengthy yet lawful civil detention that may arise from inefficient investigation by immigration officers, defendant may request upon sentencing (if he is convicted or enters a guilty plea) that 'any prejudice traceable to the pretrial detention [] be mitigated by giving him credit for time served on the INS detainer.'\" District Court Opinion at 13 (citation omitted).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> We note that this court has not yet decided \"whether Rule 5(a) can ever be a basis for dismissal of an indictment absent evidence of unwarranted interrogation during the period of detention.\" Encarnacion, 239 F.3d at 400 n.5.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
