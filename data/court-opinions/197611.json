Ronald  Turner,  on behalf  of\r                                       \r\n\nhimself and  as administrator of  the estate of  his deceased\r\n\nwife,  Charlotte Turner, brought  this suit  in Massachusetts\r\n\nstate  court  against  Fallon  Community  Health  Plan,  Inc.\r\n\n(\"Fallon\").   The gravamen  was Fallon's  refusal to  provide\r\n\ncoverage  for a treatment regime proposed by Charlotte Turner\r\n\nand her  doctor to  address her  metastasized breast  cancer.\r\n\nAfter  the case  was removed  to federal district  court, the\r\n\ndistrict  court  granted  summary  judgment for  Fallon,  and\r\n\nRonald Turner appealed.\r\n\n     The  pertinent facts are  largely undisputed.   In 1991,\r\n\nCharlotte  Turner  was  diagnosed with  breast  cancer.   The\r\n\ndisease was  at first  treated by  surgery, chemotherapy  and\r\n\nradiation.   In May  1993, tests showed  that the  cancer had\r\n\nmetastasized, was beyond  control by conventional  therapies,\r\n\nand  threatened Charlotte Turner  with death within  12 to 18\r\n\nmonths.   Ronald Turner was  employed by General  Motors, and\r\n\nCharlotte  Turner was  covered by  the  health coverage  that\r\n\nFallon  provided  for   family  members  of   General  Motors\r\n\nemployees.\r\n\n     Fallon  is  a   health  maintenance  organization   that\r\n\nprovides  or reimburses  health care  for its  members.   Its\r\n\n\"Member  Handbook,\" which  is  presented  as  \"part  of  [the\r\n\nmember's]  contract with [Fallon],\"  describes in  detail the\r\n\nvarious   medical   costs   that   Fallon   will   cover  for\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nbeneficiaries.  Among the express exclusions set forth in the\r                                                        \r\n\nhandbook was \"bone  marrow transplant for treatment  of solid\r\n\ntumors  . .  . .\"    Dr. Ronald  Hochman, Charlotte  Turner's\r\n\noncologist at  Fallon, nevertheless concluded  that Charlotte\r\n\nTurner's  only hope was an autologous bone marrow transplant,\r\n\na  procedure  by which  the  patient's  own  bone  marrow  is\r\n\nextracted,  stored and  then reintroduced  after the  patient\r\n\nreceives high dosage chemotherapy.   Marrow is the source  of\r\n\nvital white blood cells needed to fight infection and without\r\n\nthe transplant procedure, the high dosage  chemotherapy would\r\n\nimpair the bone marrow's ability to continue to produce white\r\n\nblood cells.\r\n\n     In May  1993, Fallon approved Charlotte Turner's request\r\n\nthat she  be evaluated by  Dana Farber  Cancer Institute  for\r\n\npossible participation in its bone marrow transplant program.\r\n\nFallon continued to assert that a bone  marrow transplant was\r\n\nnot a covered procedure for  solid tumor cancer but said that\r\n\nif the treatment was recommended by  Dana Farber, the request\r\n\nfor   coverage   would  be   reviewed   further  by   Fallon.\r\n\nUltimately, Dana Farber concluded  that Charlotte Turner  was\r\n\nnot  eligible for  the Dana  Farber  protocol because  cancer\r\n\ncells  had already been  detected in Charlotte  Turner's bone\r\n\nmarrow.\r\n\n     Charlotte   Turner  then  asked   Fallon  to  cover  her\r\n\nexamination  for   eligibility  to  enter   a  program  being\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nconducted by  the Duke  University Medical Center.   In  this\r\n\nprogram,   Duke   not   only   removed    bone   marrow   for\r\n\nreimplantation,  in aid of high dosage chemotherapy, but also\r\n\nemployed procedures to  attempt to \"purge\" the  marrow of its\r\n\ncancer cells.  Fallon declined to  cover the cost of a \"third\r\n\nopinion.\"   Charlotte  Turner then  had  herself examined  by\r\n\ndoctors at the  Duke program who concluded that  she might be\r\n\neligible to  participate, subject  to further  testing.   The\r\n\ncost of her  participation in  the program  was estimated  at\r\n\n$100,000.\r\n\n     In July  1993, Charlotte  Turner and  Dr. Hochman  asked\r\n\nFallon to  pay for  her inclusion in  the Duke  program.   In\r\n\nAugust 1993,  Fallon's Transplant  Committee met to  consider\r\n\nCharlotte Turner's  request and the broader  question whether\r\n\ncoverage should be extended, on a case-by-case basis, to bone\r\n\nmarrow  transplants to treat solid tumor cancers either under\r\n\nthe Dana  Farber protocol or  the Duke program or  both.  Dr.\r\n\nHochman supported Charlotte Turner's application for coverage\r\n\nto the Duke program.\r\n\n     The  Transplant  Committee  decided  that,  despite  its\r\n\nhandbook  exclusion, it would  in the future  extend coverage\r\n\nfor  the  Dana  Farber  protocol   if  it  concluded  in  the\r\n\nparticular case that  the treatment was critically  necessary\r\n\nand showed  a strong  likelihood of  success.  It  concluded,\r\n\nhowever,  that  the  Duke  program  had  as yet  produced  no\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nadequate  data  suggesting  a   likelihood  of  success,  and\r\n\ntherefore declined to  extend coverage for the  Duke program.\r\n\nAt Charlotte Turner's  request, Fallon's Grievance  Committee\r\n\nheld a  hearing in September  1993 to review the  decision of\r\n\nthe  Transplant Committee,  but in  early  October 1993,  the\r\n\nGrievance Committee  upheld the  denial of  coverage for  the\r\n\nDuke program.\r\n\n     Immediately after the Grievance Committee's decision  in\r\n\nOctober 1993,  Charlotte Turner  underwent conventional  low-\r\n\ndosage chemotherapy without bone marrow transplantation.  She\r\n\ndied on August 17, 1994.  Ronald  Turner then brought suit in\r\n\nthe Massachusetts superior  court against Fallon  charging it\r\n\nwith breach of  contract, wrongful death and  other state-law\r\n\nclaims.  Fallon removed the case to federal district court on\r\n\nthe ground that state-law claims were preempted under ERISA--\r\n\nthe  Employee  Retirement  Income Security  Act  of  1974, 29\r\n\nU.S.C.    1001 et seq.   See  Metropolitan Life  Ins. Co.  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nTaylor, 481 U.S. 58, 66-67 (1987). \r                  \r\n\n     Ronald Turner  responded by  amending  his complaint  to\r\n\ndelete  the state  claims  and to  substitute  a claim  under\r\n\nERISA.    The  amended single-count  complaint  charged  that\r\n\nFallon's  denial of  coverage for  the  Duke program  \"denied\r\n\nCharlotte of the rights and benefits due under the policy and\r\n\nwas arbitrary, illegal, capricious, unreasonable and not made\r\n\nin good faith  and was a breach of  [Fallon's] fiduciary duty\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nwhich  it owed to  Charlotte.\"  The  complaint sought damages\r\n\nand a trial by jury.\r\n\n     In  March  1996,  Fallon  moved  for  summary  judgment.\r\n\nRonald  Turner opposed  the  motion  and  asked  for  further\r\n\ndiscovery, which Fallon in turn opposed.  The  district court\r\n\nthen ruled  that a civil  ERISA action could be  brought by a\r\n\nplan beneficiary  only  (in the  words  of the  statute)  \"to\r\n\nrecover benefits due  to him under the terms of  his plan, to\r\n\nenforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify\r\n\nhis rights to  future benefits under the terms  of the plan.\"\r\n\n29 U.S.C.    1132(a)(1)(B).  Concluding that  Ronald Turner's\r\n\ndamage action was  not authorized by  ERISA, the court  ruled\r\n\nthat the case had to  be dismissed and that further discovery\r\n\nwould be futile.\r\n\n     Ronald  Turner  then  sought  reconsideration  and  also\r\n\nsought  to amend  the complaint  to  reassert the  previously\r\n\nwithdrawn state-law claims.  He argued that if ERISA provided\r\n\nno federal remedy, it ought not be read to preempt his state-\r\n\nlaw  claims.  Alternatively, he urged that if ERISA preempted\r\n\nthe  state-law claims,  then  a federal  remedy  ought to  be\r\n\ninferred  or created  by  the  court  to permit  damages  for\r\n\nwrongful withholding of treatment under the employee benefits\r\n\nplan.  The district court wrote a thoughtful  opinion denying\r\n\nthese requests.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\n     On this appeal, we begin with Ronald Turner's claim that\r\n\nERISA should be read  to confer a claim for damages where, as\r\n\ncharged in  the amended complaint, a beneficiary  of the plan\r\n\nhas  been  denied \"the  rights  and  benefits due  under  the\r\n\npolicy\" or has suffered \"a breach of . . . fiduciary duty\" in\r\n\nthe withholding of  those benefits.  ERISA is a comprehensive\r\n\nfederal statute that governs not only pension  plans but also\r\n\nnonpension benefit plans, including the General Motors health\r\n\nbenefits plan at issue in this case.\r\n\n     ERISA   sets  forth  a   half  dozen  civil  enforcement\r\n\nprovisions.   29  U.S.C.    1132(a).   Under  the first  such\r\n\nprovision, a beneficiary may bring a federal civil action \"to\r\n\nrecover  benefits due to him under the  terms of his plan, to\r\n\nenforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify\r\n\nhis rights to  future benefits under the terms  of the plan.\"\r\n\nId.    1132(a)(1)(B).   The relief  expressly provided  is to\r               \r\n\nsecure benefits  under the  plan rather  than  damages for  a\r\n\nbreach of the plan.  Here, treatment coverage is no longer of\r\n\nany significance.  \r\n\n     The other pertinent remedial provision authorizes  civil\r\n\naction  by   a  beneficiary  \"to  obtain   other  appropriate\r\n\nequitable  relief\" to  address  violations  of  ERISA  or  to\r\n\nenforce the  plan.  29  U.S.C.   1132(a)(3)(B).   The Supreme\r\n\nCourt recently held in  Varity Corp. v. Howe, 116 S. Ct. 1065\r                                                        \r\n\n(1996),  that  this  provision  may  permit  equitable relief\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\nagainst  a plan administrator  for breaches of  the fiduciary\r\n\nduty imposed  on such  administrators by ERISA.   See  id. at\r                                                                      \r\n\n1075-79.     But  this  provision  is  expressly  limited  to\r\n\nproviding equitable relief, and equitable relief is not being\r\n\nsought in this case.\r\n\n     Ronald  Turner points  to  no  other  specific  remedial\r\n\nprovision in ERISA that might  arguably be brought into  play\r\n\nin this case.   In fact, the Supreme Court  has stressed that\r\n\nERISA  does  not  create  compensatory   or  punitive  damage\r\n\nremedies  where an administrator  of a plan  fails to provide\r\n\nthe benefits  due under  that plan.   See  Massachusetts Mut.\r                                                                         \r\n\nLife  Ins. Co.  v. Russell,  473  U.S. 134  (1985); see  also\r                                                                         \r\n\nDrinkwater v. Metropolitan  Life Ins. Co., 846  F.2d 821, 825\r                                                     \r\n\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 909 (1988).  This is not a\r                                    \r\n\nminor  technicality:   damage awards  may increase  effective\r\n\ncoverage but  may  also add  significantly  to the  costs  of\r\n\ncoverage.\r\n\n     The lack of  an express damage  remedy under ERISA  does\r\n\nnot necessarily  end  the story.    The federal  courts  have\r\n\nregularly  inferred  or  created remedies  in  the  shadow of\r\n\nfederal statutes, although the practice has waned somewhat in\r\n\nrecent  years.    See,  e.g.,  Northwest  Airlines,  Inc.  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nTransport Workers, 451  U.S. 77, 94 (1981).   But the Supreme\r                             \r\n\nCourt has adamantly ruled that ERISA's express remedies are a\r\n\nsignal to courts not to  create additional remedies of  their\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\nown.   Russell, 473 U.S. at 145-48.   See also Reich v. Rowe,\r                                                                        \r\n\n20 F.3d  25, 31-33 (1st  Cir. 1994); Drinkwater, 846  F.2d at\r                                                           \r\n\n824.  \r\n\n     In  the alternative, Ronald Turner argues that ERISA, if\r\n\nit provides no  damage remedy of its own  either expressly or\r\n\nby  implication, should  at least  not be  taken  to preclude\r\n\nexisting  state  remedies.     Absent  preemption,  a  health\r\n\nbenefits plan like Fallon's  could certainly be treated as  a\r\n\ncontract enforceable under state law and subject to the usual\r\n\ncontractual   remedies,   including   compensatory   damages.\r\n\nDepending on the  jurisdiction, state law might  provide even\r\n\nmore substantial relief, including punitive damages.  \r\n\n     ERISA  contains a  vague but  broadly  worded preemption\r\n\nprovision.   With exceptions  not relevant here,  it provides\r\n\nthat  the pertinent subchapter  of ERISA shall  supersede any\r\n\nand  all \"State  laws insofar  as they  may now  or hereafter\r\n\nrelate to  any employee benefit  plan\" covered by ERISA.   29\r\n\nU.S.C.    1144(a).    However  this  general  language  might\r\n\notherwise  have been read, the Supreme Court has construed it\r\n\nto preclude  state claims  to enforce  rights under  an ERISA\r\n\nplan or obtain damages for the wrongful withholding of  those\r\n\nrights, Pilot  Life Ins.

The  one that Ronald\r\n\nTurner  seeks  to  present  is  the  case  of  a  beneficiary\r\n\nwrongfully  denied promised  benefits.   There  is reason  to\r\n\ndoubt that that is the true problem in this case (a  point to\r                                                       \r\n\nwhich we will return), but such cases are easy to imagine and\r\n\ncertain  to occur.   Compensatory damages are  a conventional\r\n\nand  potent remedy  that might  indeed  deter misconduct  and\r\n\nmitigate loss,  although the cost  of the plan would  also be\r\n\nincreased.  \r\n\n     On the other hand, some might think it perverse to dwell\r\n\non damage remedies, which apply where the patient has died or\r\n\nalready suffered injury,  and might urge instead  that courts\r\n\nimprove access  to equitable  relief.   This remedy,  already\r                                        \r\n\navailable  under  ERISA,  can address  a  wrongful  denial of\r\n\nbenefits  while  the  patient is  still  alive  and unharmed.\r\n\nAlthough  Ronald Turner  says that  such  judicial relief  is\r\n\nreadily frustrated by exhaustion of remedies rules, a failure\r\n\nto exhaust is easily forgiven  for good reason, and no reason\r\n\nis better than an  imminent threat to life or health.

(\"Fallon\").  The gravamen was Fallon's refusal to provide coverage for a treatment regime proposed by Charlotte Turner and her doctor to address her metastasized breast cancer.  After the case was removed to federal district court, the district court granted summary judgment for Fallon, and Ronald Turner appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pertinent facts are largely undisputed.  In 1991, Charlotte Turner was diagnosed with breast cancer.  The disease was at first treated by surgery, chemotherapy and radiation.  In May 1993, tests showed that the cancer had metastasized, was beyond control by conventional therapies, and threatened Charlotte Turner with death within 12 to 18 months.  Ronald Turner was employed by General Motors, and Charlotte Turner was covered by the health coverage that Fallon provided for family members of General Motors employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fallon is a health maintenance organization that provides or reimburses health care for its members.  Its \"Member Handbook,\" which is presented as \"part of [the member's] contract with [Fallon],\" describes in detail the various medical costs that Fallon will cover for beneficiaries.  Among the express exclusions set forth in the handbook was \"bone marrow transplant for treatment of solid tumors....\"  Dr. Ronald Hochman, Charlotte Turner's oncologist at Fallon, nevertheless concluded that Charlotte Turner's only hope was an autologous bone marrow transplant, a procedure by which the patient's own bone marrow is extracted, stored and then reintroduced after the patient receives high dosage chemotherapy.  Marrow is the source of vital white blood cells needed to fight infection and without the transplant procedure, the high dosage chemotherapy would impair the bone marrow's ability to continue to produce white blood cells.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1993, Fallon approved Charlotte Turner's request that she be evaluated by Dana Farber Cancer Institute for possible participation in its bone marrow transplant program.  Fallon continued to assert that a bone marrow transplant was not a covered procedure for solid tumor cancer but said that if the treatment was recommended by Dana Farber, the request for coverage would be reviewed further by Fallon.  Ultimately, Dana Farber concluded that Charlotte Turner was not eligible for the Dana Farber protocol because cancer cells had already been detected in Charlotte Turner's bone marrow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Charlotte Turner then asked Fallon to cover her examination for eligibility to enter a program being conducted by the Duke University Medical Center.  In this program, Duke not only removed bone marrow for reimplantation, in aid of high dosage chemotherapy, but also employed procedures to attempt to \"purge\" the marrow of its cancer cells.  Fallon declined to cover the cost of a \"third opinion.\"   Charlotte Turner then had herself examined by doctors at the Duke program who concluded that she might be eligible to participate, subject to further testing.  The cost of her participation in the program was estimated at $100,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1993, Charlotte Turner and Dr. Hochman asked Fallon to pay for her inclusion in the Duke program.  In August 1993, Fallon's Transplant Committee met to consider Charlotte Turner's request and the broader question whether coverage should be extended, on a case-by-case basis, to bone marrow transplants to treat solid tumor cancers either under the Dana Farber protocol or the Duke program or both.  Dr. Hochman supported Charlotte Turner's application for coverage to the Duke program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Transplant Committee decided that, despite its handbook exclusion, it would in the future extend coverage for the Dana Farber protocol if it concluded in the particular case that the treatment was critically necessary and showed a strong likelihood of success.  It concluded, however, that the Duke program had as yet produced no adequate data suggesting a likelihood of success, and therefore declined to extend coverage for the Duke program.  At Charlotte Turner's request, Fallon's Grievance Committee held a hearing in September 1993 to review the decision of the Transplant Committee, but in early October 1993, the Grievance Committee upheld the denial of coverage for the Duke program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Immediately after the Grievance Committee's decision in October 1993, Charlotte Turner underwent conventional low-dosage chemotherapy without bone marrow transplantation.  She died on August 17, 1994.  Ronald Turner then brought suit in the Massachusetts superior court against Fallon charging it with breach of contract, wrongful death and other state-law claims.  Fallon removed the case to federal district court on the ground that state-law claims were preempted under ERISA--the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1001 et seq.  See Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, 481 U.S. 58, 66-67, 107 S.Ct. 1542, 1547-48, 95 L.Ed.2d 55 (1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ronald Turner responded by amending his complaint to delete the state claims and to substitute a claim under ERISA.  The amended single-count complaint charged that Fallon's denial of coverage for the Duke program \"denied Charlotte of the rights and benefits due under the policy and was arbitrary, illegal, capricious, unreasonable and not made in good faith and was a breach of [Fallon's] fiduciary duty which it owed to Charlotte.\"   The complaint sought damages and a trial by jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1996, Fallon moved for summary judgment.  Ronald Turner opposed the motion and asked for further discovery, which Fallon in turn opposed.  The district court then ruled that a civil ERISA action could be brought by a plan beneficiary only (in the words of the statute) \"to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.\"  29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(a)(1)(B).  Concluding that Ronald Turner's damage action was not authorized by ERISA, the court ruled that the case had to be dismissed and that further discovery would be futile.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ronald Turner then sought reconsideration and also sought to amend the complaint to reassert the previously withdrawn state-law claims.  He argued that if ERISA provided no federal remedy, it ought not be read to preempt his state-law claims.  Alternatively, he urged that if ERISA preempted the state-law claims, then a federal remedy ought to be inferred or created by the court to permit damages for wrongful withholding of treatment under the employee benefits plan.  The district court wrote a thoughtful opinion denying these requests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, we begin with Ronald Turner's claim that ERISA should be read to confer a claim for damages where, as charged in the amended complaint, a beneficiary of the plan has been denied \"the rights and benefits due under the policy\" or has suffered \"a breach of ... fiduciary duty\" in the withholding of those benefits.  ERISA is a comprehensive federal statute that governs not only pension plans but also nonpension benefit plans, including the General Motors health benefits plan at issue in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ERISA sets forth a half dozen civil enforcement provisions.  29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(a).  Under the first such provision, a beneficiary may bring a federal civil action \"to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.\"  Id. &#167; 1132(a)(1)(B).  The relief expressly provided is to secure benefits under the plan rather than damages for a breach of the plan.  Here, treatment coverage is no longer of any significance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other pertinent remedial provision authorizes civil action by a beneficiary \"to obtain other appropriate equitable relief\" to address violations of ERISA or to enforce the plan.  29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(a)(3)(B).  The Supreme Court recently held in Varity Corp. v. Howe, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1065, 134 L.Ed.2d 130 (1996), that this provision may permit equitable relief against a plan administrator for breaches of the fiduciary duty imposed on such administrators by ERISA.  See id. at ---- - ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1075-79.   But this provision is expressly limited to providing equitable relief, and equitable relief is not being sought in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ronald Turner points to no other specific remedial provision in ERISA that might arguably be brought into play in this case.  In fact, the Supreme Court has stressed that ERISA does not create compensatory or punitive damage remedies where an administrator of a plan fails to provide the benefits due under that plan.  See Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473 U.S. 134, 105 S.Ct. 3085, 87 L.Ed.2d 96 (1985);  see also Drinkwater v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 846 F.2d 821, 825 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 909, 109 S.Ct. 261, 102 L.Ed.2d 249 (1988).  This is not a minor technicality:  damage awards may increase effective coverage but may also add significantly to the costs of coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lack of an express damage remedy under ERISA does not necessarily end the story.  The federal courts have regularly inferred or created remedies in the shadow of federal statutes, although the practice has waned somewhat in recent years.  See, e.g., Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Transport Workers, 451 U.S. 77, 94, 101 S.Ct. 1571, 1582, 67 L.Ed.2d 750 (1981).  But the Supreme Court has adamantly ruled that ERISA's express remedies are a signal to courts not to create additional remedies of their own.  Russell, 473 U.S. at 145-48, 105 S.Ct. at 3091-93.   See also Reich v. Rowe, 20 F.3d 25, 31-33 (1st Cir.1994);  Drinkwater, 846 F.2d at 824.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the alternative, Ronald Turner argues that ERISA, if it provides no damage remedy of its own either expressly or by implication, should at least not be taken to preclude existing state remedies.  Absent preemption, a health benefits plan like Fallon's could certainly be treated as a contract enforceable under state law and subject to the usual contractual remedies, including compensatory damages.  Depending on the jurisdiction, state law might provide even more substantial relief, including punitive damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ERISA contains a vague but broadly worded preemption provision.  With exceptions not relevant here, it provides that the pertinent subchapter of ERISA shall supersede any and all \"State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan\" covered by ERISA.  29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(a).  However this general language might otherwise have been read, the Supreme Court has construed it to preclude state claims to enforce rights under an ERISA plan or obtain damages for the wrongful withholding of those rights, Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U.S. 41, 52-57, 107 S.Ct. 1549, 1555-58, 95 L.Ed.2d 39 (1987), and this construction has been repeatedly followed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has recently set some new limits on preemption by holding that certain state laws were not sufficiently \"related\" to ERISA to deserve preemption.  See De Buono v. NYSA-ILA Medical &amp; Clinical Servs.  Fund, --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 117 S.Ct. 1747, 1752-53, 138 L.Ed.2d 21 (1997);  California Div. of Labor Standards Enforcement v. Dillingham Constr., N.A., --- U.S. ----, ----, 117 S.Ct. 832, 842, 136 L.Ed.2d 791 (1997).  But neither of these cases involved a state's attempt to provide state remedies for what is in essence a plan administrator's refusal to pay allegedly promised benefits.  It would be difficult to think of a state law that \"relates\" more closely to an employee benefit plan than one that affords remedies for the breach of obligations under that plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ronald Turner more or less admits that existing Supreme Court precedent is against him, both as to an implicit federal cause of action and the preemption of state claims.  But he says that it is grossly unjust to deny any remedy, either state or federal, to compensate in damages the victim, family or estate of one who has been wrongfully denied promised health-care benefits.  Further, he argues that this gap provides a cruel incentive for plan administrators to withhold treatment or delay it as long as possible, since the claim for benefits may be mooted by the beneficiary's death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are in reality two quite different problems of law and policy entangled in this argument.  The one that Ronald Turner seeks to present is the case of a beneficiary wrongfully denied promised benefits.  There is reason to doubt that that is the true problem in this case (a point to which we will return), but such cases are easy to imagine and certain to occur.  Compensatory damages are a conventional and potent remedy that might indeed deter misconduct and mitigate loss, although the cost of the plan would also be increased.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, some might think it perverse to dwell on damage remedies, which apply where the patient has died or already suffered injury, and might urge instead that courts improve access to equitable relief.  This remedy, already available under ERISA, can address a wrongful denial of benefits while the patient is still alive and unharmed.  Although Ronald Turner says that such judicial relief is readily frustrated by exhaustion of remedies rules, a failure to exhaust is easily forgiven for good reason, and no reason is better than an imminent threat to life or health.  E.g., Portela-Gonzalez v. Secretary of the Navy, 109 F.3d 74, 77 (1st Cir.1997);  see also DePina v. General Dynamics Corp., 674 F.Supp. 46, 49 (D.Mass.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, it is certainly a matter for reasonable debate whether a damage remedy should be added, either by judicial interpolation or by Congress.  But only the Supreme Court could alter the existing case law that precludes such a remedy.  And whether or not Congress ever thought about the impact on health care in particular when it wrote ERISA's remedies and preemption provisions, Congress is well equipped to revisit the issue and alter the statutory language that now stands as a bar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the question of a damages remedy is an important one, it likely has no practical importance in this case.  The central obligation of Fallon to Charlotte Turner is fixed by the terms of the health plan, and it would be difficult to find an exclusion more unequivocal than Fallon's written exclusion of bone marrow transplant treatment for solid tumors.  Even if Fallon were treated as having modified the contract in August 1997, the modification seemingly extended only to the Dana Farber program, for which Charlotte Turner was admittedly ineligible.  Thus, anything akin to a contract claim looks almost hopeless on this record.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ronald Turner's position is not improved by invoking fiduciary concepts under ERISA.  Beneficiaries may sue a plan for breach of fiduciary duty causing individual harm, but such suits are allowed only for equitable relief and, even then, only where Congress has failed to provide more specific relief.  See Varity Corp., --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1079.   Neither condition is met here since Ronald Turner seeks damages, not equitable relief, and his grievance--a denial of benefits--is specifically addressed by 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(a)(1)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, Fallon also owes a duty to other plan participants who have a continuing interest in the solvency of the plan and the expenditure of its funds for covered medical procedures.  See Varity Corp., --- U.S. at ---- - ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1078-79.   The notion that there is a fiduciary duty on Fallon's part to expend funds for treatment explicitly excluded from the plan would be quite a stretch.  This is not a case where Fallon promised without exclusion to cover any \"appropriate\" or \"reasonable\" procedure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, in all likelihood, the real problem confronting the Turners was not one of judicial remedies but a larger and more intractable one.  It is a society-wide problem of when and how to provide last-chance health care for a courageous patient faced with a mortal disease who may have a small chance at survival if provided an expensive cutting edge treatment that she cannot afford out of her own resources.

(\"Fallon\").  The gravamen was Fallon's refusal to provide coverage for a treatment regime proposed by Charlotte Turner and her doctor to address her metastasized breast cancer.  After the case was removed to federal district court, the district court granted summary judgment for Fallon, and Ronald Turner appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pertinent facts are largely undisputed.  In 1991, Charlotte Turner was diagnosed with breast cancer.  The disease was at first treated by surgery, chemotherapy and radiation.  In May 1993, tests showed that the cancer had metastasized, was beyond control by conventional therapies, and threatened Charlotte Turner with death within 12 to 18 months.  Ronald Turner was employed by General Motors, and Charlotte Turner was covered by the health coverage that Fallon provided for family members of General Motors employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fallon is a health maintenance organization that provides or reimburses health care for its members.  Its \"Member Handbook,\" which is presented as \"part of [the member's] contract with [Fallon],\" describes in detail the various medical costs that Fallon will cover for beneficiaries.  Among the express exclusions set forth in the handbook was \"bone marrow transplant for treatment of solid tumors....\"  Dr. Ronald Hochman, Charlotte Turner's oncologist at Fallon, nevertheless concluded that Charlotte Turner's only hope was an autologous bone marrow transplant, a procedure by which the patient's own bone marrow is extracted, stored and then reintroduced after the patient receives high dosage chemotherapy.  Marrow is the source of vital white blood cells needed to fight infection and without the transplant procedure, the high dosage chemotherapy would impair the bone marrow's ability to continue to produce white blood cells.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1993, Fallon approved Charlotte Turner's request that she be evaluated by Dana Farber Cancer Institute for possible participation in its bone marrow transplant program.  Fallon continued to assert that a bone marrow transplant was not a covered procedure for solid tumor cancer but said that if the treatment was recommended by Dana Farber, the request for coverage would be reviewed further by Fallon.  Ultimately, Dana Farber concluded that Charlotte Turner was not eligible for the Dana Farber protocol because cancer cells had already been detected in Charlotte Turner's bone marrow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Charlotte Turner then asked Fallon to cover her examination for eligibility to enter a program being conducted by the Duke University Medical Center.  In this program, Duke not only removed bone marrow for reimplantation, in aid of high dosage chemotherapy, but also employed procedures to attempt to \"purge\" the marrow of its cancer cells.  Fallon declined to cover the cost of a \"third opinion.\"   Charlotte Turner then had herself examined by doctors at the Duke program who concluded that she might be eligible to participate, subject to further testing.  The cost of her participation in the program was estimated at $100,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1993, Charlotte Turner and Dr. Hochman asked Fallon to pay for her inclusion in the Duke program.  In August 1993, Fallon's Transplant Committee met to consider Charlotte Turner's request and the broader question whether coverage should be extended, on a case-by-case basis, to bone marrow transplants to treat solid tumor cancers either under the Dana Farber protocol or the Duke program or both.  Dr. Hochman supported Charlotte Turner's application for coverage to the Duke program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Transplant Committee decided that, despite its handbook exclusion, it would in the future extend coverage for the Dana Farber protocol if it concluded in the particular case that the treatment was critically necessary and showed a strong likelihood of success.  It concluded, however, that the Duke program had as yet produced no adequate data suggesting a likelihood of success, and therefore declined to extend coverage for the Duke program.  At Charlotte Turner's request, Fallon's Grievance Committee held a hearing in September 1993 to review the decision of the Transplant Committee, but in early October 1993, the Grievance Committee upheld the denial of coverage for the Duke program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Immediately after the Grievance Committee's decision in October 1993, Charlotte Turner underwent conventional low-dosage chemotherapy without bone marrow transplantation.  She died on August 17, 1994.  Ronald Turner then brought suit in the Massachusetts superior court against Fallon charging it with breach of contract, wrongful death and other state-law claims.  Fallon removed the case to federal district court on the ground that state-law claims were preempted under ERISA--the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1001 et seq.  See Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111859\"><a href=\"/opinion/111859/metropolitan-life-ins-co-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span>, 66-67, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111859\"><a href=\"/opinion/111859/metropolitan-life-ins-co-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The amended single-count complaint charged that Fallon's denial of coverage for the Duke program \"denied Charlotte of the rights and benefits due under the policy and was arbitrary, illegal, capricious, unreasonable and not made in good faith and was a breach of [Fallon's] fiduciary duty which it owed to Charlotte.\"   The complaint sought damages and a trial by jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1996, Fallon moved for summary judgment.  Ronald Turner opposed the motion and asked for further discovery, which Fallon in turn opposed.  The district court then ruled that a civil ERISA action could be brought by a plan beneficiary only (in the words of the statute) \"to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.\"  29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(a)(1)(B).  Concluding that Ronald Turner's damage action was not authorized by ERISA, the court ruled that the case had to be dismissed and that further discovery would be futile.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ronald Turner then sought reconsideration and also sought to amend the complaint to reassert the previously withdrawn state-law claims.  He argued that if ERISA provided no federal remedy, it ought not be read to preempt his state-law claims.  Alternatively, he urged that if ERISA preempted the state-law claims, then a federal remedy ought to be inferred or created by the court to permit damages for wrongful withholding of treatment under the employee benefits plan.  The district court wrote a thoughtful opinion denying these requests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal, we begin with Ronald Turner's claim that ERISA should be read to confer a claim for damages where, as charged in the amended complaint, a beneficiary of the plan has been denied \"the rights and benefits due under the policy\" or has suffered \"a breach of ... fiduciary duty\" in the withholding of those benefits.  ERISA is a comprehensive federal statute that governs not only pension plans but also nonpension benefit plans, including the General Motors health benefits plan at issue in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ERISA sets forth a half dozen civil enforcement provisions.  29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(a).  Under the first such provision, a beneficiary may bring a federal civil action \"to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.\"  Id. &#167; 1132(a)(1)(B).  The relief expressly provided is to secure benefits under the plan rather than damages for a breach of the plan.  Here, treatment coverage is no longer of any significance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other pertinent remedial provision authorizes civil action by a beneficiary \"to obtain other appropriate equitable relief\" to address violations of ERISA or to enforce the plan.  29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(a)(3)(B).  The Supreme Court recently held in Varity Corp. v. Howe, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118008\"><a href=\"/opinion/118008/varity-corp-v-howe/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span> (1996), that this provision may permit equitable relief against a plan administrator for breaches of the fiduciary duty imposed on such administrators by ERISA.  See id. at ---- - ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1075-79.   But this provision is expressly limited to providing equitable relief, and equitable relief is not being sought in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ronald Turner points to no other specific remedial provision in ERISA that might arguably be brought into play in this case.  In fact, the Supreme Court has stressed that ERISA does not create compensatory or punitive damage remedies where an administrator of a plan fails to provide the benefits due under that plan.  See Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111499\"><a href=\"/opinion/111499/massachusetts-mut-life-ins-co-v-russell/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111499\"><a href=\"/opinion/111499/massachusetts-mut-life-ins-co-v-russell/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This is not a minor technicality:  damage awards may increase effective coverage but may also add significantly to the costs of coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lack of an express damage remedy under ERISA does not necessarily end the story.  The federal courts have regularly inferred or created remedies in the shadow of federal statutes, although the practice has waned somewhat in recent years.  See, e.g., Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Transport Workers, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110460\"><a href=\"/opinion/110460/northwest-airlines-inc-v-transport-workers/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span>, 94, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110460\"><a href=\"/opinion/110460/northwest-airlines-inc-v-transport-workers/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">750</span></a></span> (1981).  But the Supreme Court has adamantly ruled that ERISA's express remedies are a signal to courts not to create additional remedies of their own.  Russell, 473 U.S. at 145-48, 105 S.Ct. at 3091-93.   See also Reich v. Rowe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195288\"><a href=\"/opinion/195288/reich-labr-v-rowe/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 31-33 (1st Cir.1994);  Drinkwater, 846 F.2d at 824.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the alternative, Ronald Turner argues that ERISA, if it provides no damage remedy of its own either expressly or by implication, should at least not be taken to preclude existing state remedies.  Absent preemption, a health benefits plan like Fallon's could certainly be treated as a contract enforceable under state law and subject to the usual contractual remedies, including compensatory damages.  Depending on the jurisdiction, state law might provide even more substantial relief, including punitive damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ERISA contains a vague but broadly worded preemption provision.  With exceptions not relevant here, it provides that the pertinent subchapter of ERISA shall supersede any and all \"State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan\" covered by ERISA.  29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(a).  However this general language might otherwise have been read, the Supreme Court has construed it to preclude state claims to enforce rights under an ERISA plan or obtain damages for the wrongful withholding of those rights, Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111858\"><a href=\"/opinion/111858/pilot-life-ins-co-v-dedeaux/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 52-57, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111858\"><a href=\"/opinion/111858/pilot-life-ins-co-v-dedeaux/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

See De Buono v. NYSA-ILA Medical &amp; Clinical Servs.  Fund, --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118119\"><a href=\"/opinion/118119/de-buono-v-nysa-ila-medical-and-clinical-services-fund/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">791</span></a></span> (1997).  But neither of these cases involved a state's attempt to provide state remedies for what is in essence a plan administrator's refusal to pay allegedly promised benefits.  It would be difficult to think of a state law that \"relates\" more closely to an employee benefit plan than one that affords remedies for the breach of obligations under that plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ronald Turner more or less admits that existing Supreme Court precedent is against him, both as to an implicit federal cause of action and the preemption of state claims.  But he says that it is grossly unjust to deny any remedy, either state or federal, to compensate in damages the victim, family or estate of one who has been wrongfully denied promised health-care benefits.  Further, he argues that this gap provides a cruel incentive for plan administrators to withhold treatment or delay it as long as possible, since the claim for benefits may be mooted by the beneficiary's death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are in reality two quite different problems of law and policy entangled in this argument.  The one that Ronald Turner seeks to present is the case of a beneficiary wrongfully denied promised benefits.  There is reason to doubt that that is the true problem in this case (a point to which we will return), but such cases are easy to imagine and certain to occur.  Compensatory damages are a conventional and potent remedy that might indeed deter misconduct and mitigate loss, although the cost of the plan would also be increased.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, some might think it perverse to dwell on damage remedies, which apply where the patient has died or already suffered injury, and might urge instead that courts improve access to equitable relief.  This remedy, already available under ERISA, can address a wrongful denial of benefits while the patient is still alive and unharmed.  Although Ronald Turner says that such judicial relief is readily frustrated by exhaustion of remedies rules, a failure to exhaust is easily forgiven for good reason, and no reason is better than an imminent threat to life or health.  E.g., Portela-Gonzalez v. Secretary of the Navy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"738223\"><a href=\"/opinion/738223/astrid-l-portela-gonzalez-v-secretary-of-the-navy/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span>, 77 (1st Cir.1997);  see also DePina v. General Dynamics Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1521338\"><a href=\"/opinion/1521338/depina-v-general-dynamics-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">674</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 49 (D.Mass.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, it is certainly a matter for reasonable debate whether a damage remedy should be added, either by judicial interpolation or by Congress.  But only the Supreme Court could alter the existing case law that precludes such a remedy.  And whether or not Congress ever thought about the impact on health care in particular when it wrote ERISA's remedies and preemption provisions, Congress is well equipped to revisit the issue and alter the statutory language that now stands as a bar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the question of a damages remedy is an important one, it likely has no practical importance in this case.  The central obligation of Fallon to Charlotte Turner is fixed by the terms of the health plan, and it would be difficult to find an exclusion more unequivocal than Fallon's written exclusion of bone marrow transplant treatment for solid tumors.  Even if Fallon were treated as having modified the contract in August 1997, the modification seemingly extended only to the Dana Farber program, for which Charlotte Turner was admittedly ineligible.  Thus, anything akin to a contract claim looks almost hopeless on this record.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ronald Turner's position is not improved by invoking fiduciary concepts under ERISA.  Beneficiaries may sue a plan for breach of fiduciary duty causing individual harm, but such suits are allowed only for equitable relief and, even then, only where Congress has failed to provide more specific relief.  See Varity Corp., --- U.S. at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1079.   Neither condition is met here since Ronald Turner seeks damages, not equitable relief, and his grievance--a denial of benefits--is specifically addressed by 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(a)(1)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, Fallon also owes a duty to other plan participants who have a continuing interest in the solvency of the plan and the expenditure of its funds for covered medical procedures.  See Varity Corp., --- U.S. at ---- - ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1078-79.   The notion that there is a fiduciary duty on Fallon's part to expend funds for treatment explicitly excluded from the plan would be quite a stretch.  This is not a case where Fallon promised without exclusion to cover any \"appropriate\" or \"reasonable\" procedure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, in all likelihood, the real problem confronting the Turners was not one of judicial remedies but a larger and more intractable one.  It is a society-wide problem of when and how to provide last-chance health care for a courageous patient faced with a mortal disease who may have a small chance at survival if provided an expensive cutting edge treatment that she cannot afford out of her own resources.  This is not the kind of problem to which courts can supply the solution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HILL, Senior Circuit Judge, specially concurring.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant, recognizing that the statutory and case law compels the district court's grant of summary judgment to appellee, addresses entreaties to us which, if appropriate at all, are appropriate to the legislative branch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Periodic accusations to the contrary notwithstanding, the courts are not legislative bodies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I concur.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eleventh Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s-s_ref\">**</a>\n        <p> Of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> See, e.g., Ingersoll-Rand Co. v.
