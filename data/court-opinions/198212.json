Saris, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                      Before\r\n\n               Lynch, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n            Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n             and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\r\n\nMiriam Conrad for appellant.\r\nRobert E. Richardson, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\r\nDonald K. Stern, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                November 20, 1998\r\n                                             CYR, Senior Circuit Judge.  Defendant Thomas J. Burns\r\nchallenges the two-point sentencing enhancement imposed upon him by\r\nthe district court pursuant to USSG  2B3.1(b)(2)(F) (1995) for\r\nhaving made \"express threat[s] of death\" during two separate bank\r\nrobberies.  We affirm.\r\n                      I\r\n                  BACKGROUND\r\nBurns robbed the banks in the spring of 1997, on each\r\noccasion handing the teller a note warning: \"I have a gun!  Don't\r\nmake me use it.\"  After the government charged Burns with two\r\ncounts of bank robbery, see 18 U.S.C.  2113(a), the parties\r\narrived at a plea agreement whereby the government promised to\r\nrefrain, \"at sentencing,\" from recommending that Burns receive the\r\ntwo-level enhancement under  2B3.1(b)(2)(F) for making \"express\r\nthreat[s] of death\" during the robberies.  Although the government\r\nabided by its agreement, the district court nevertheless elected to\r\nimpose the two-level enhancement.\r\n                      II\r\n                  DISCUSSION\r\nA.   The Scope of the Plea Agreement\r\nBefore addressing the merits, we turn to Burns' motion to\r\nstrike the government's brief on appeal.  Burns insists that the\r\ngovernment cannot be heard to contend on appeal that the district\r\ncourt correctly imposed the very sentencing enhancement which the\r\ngovernment, pursuant to the plea agreement, agreed to refrain from\r\nrecommending \"at sentencing,\" see Plea Agreement  3.\r\nWe acknowledge concerns regarding the government's\r\nambivalence, especially since a commonsense understanding of the\r\nlanguage of the plea agreement itself offers little hint that the\r\nparties mutually contemplated that the government remained free to\r\nadvocate a two-level enhancement on appeal.  As we repeatedly have\r\nmade clear, moreover, \"[b]ecause plea bargaining requires\r\ndefendants to waive fundamental constitutional rights, we hold\r\nprosecutors engaging in plea bargaining to 'the most meticulous\r\nstandards of both promise and performance.'\"   United States v.\r\nVelez-Carrero,  77 F.3d 11, 11 (1st Cir. 1996) (citation omitted).\r\nSee United States v. Clark, 55 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir. 1995); Correalev. United States, 479 F.2d 944, 947 (1st Cir. 1973).  We think the\r\nmessage is clear, therefore, that significant plea-agreement terms\r\nshould be stated explicitly and unambiguously so as to preclude\r\ntheir subsequent circumvention by either party.  See United Statesv. Canada, 960 F.2d 263, 269 (1st Cir. 1992) (noting that the\r\ngovernment not only is forbidden from any \"explicit repudiation of\r\n[its] assurances,\" but from \"end-runs around them\"); United Statesv. Garcia, 698 F.2d 31, 37 (1st Cir. 1983) (\"'A plea agreement is\r\nnot an appropriate context for the Government to resort to a\r\nrigidly literal approach in the construction of language.'\")\r\n(citation omitted).  Thus, defense counsel too must be alert to the\r\nneed for clear and explicit articulation of all pertinent terms in\r\nany plea agreement negotiated with government counsel.\r\nIn the instant case, however, it is not necessary to\r\ndetermine whether the government breached its plea agreement, as we\r\nwould be obliged in all events to consider whether the district\r\ncourt correctly imposed the sentencing enhancement at issue in this\r\ncase, with or without the benefit of the government's advocacy on\r\nappeal.  Accordingly, we now turn to the language of \r\n2B3.1(b)(2)(F), which we construe de novo.  See United States v.\r\nNicholas, 133 F.3d 133, 134 (1st Cir. 1998).\r\nB.   USSG  2B3.1(b)(2)(F)\r\nBurns argues that the notes handed to the bank tellers \r\nexpressly threatening to use a gun  were not \"express threat[s]\r\nof death\" for purposes of  2B3.1(b)(2)(F) because they fairly\r\ncould be interpreted simply to imply an intention to use a gun to\r\nfire warning shots or to shoot only to wound, rather than to kill. \r\nThe applicable guidelines section provided:\r\n(A) If a firearm was discharged, increase [the\r\nbase offense level] by 7 levels; (B) if a\r\nfirearm was otherwise used, increase by 6\r\nlevels; (C) if a firearm was brandished,\r\ndisplayed, or possessed, increase by 5 levels;\r\n(D) if a dangerous weapon was otherwise used,\r\nincrease by 4 levels; (E) if a dangerous\r\nweapon was brandished, displayed, or\r\npossessed, increase by 3 levels; or (F) if an\r\nexpress threat of death was made, increase by\r\n2 levels.\r\n\nUSSG  2B3.1(b)(2) (emphasis added).\r\n\nThe courts of appeals which have considered the issue to\r\ndate ascribe two conflicting interpretations to the pivotal\r\nguideline phrase \"express threat of death.\"  Seven circuits\r\npresently hold that the defendant need not have expressed in words\r\nor actions an intention \"to kill,\" provided the words or actions\r\nemployed were such as to place the victim in objectively reasonable\r\nfear for his or her life.  See United States v. Figueroa, 105 F.3d\r\n874 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 1860 (1997); United Statesv. Murray, 65 F.3d 1161 (4th Cir. 1995); United States v. Carbaugh,\r\n141 F.3d 791 (7th Cir. 1998); United States v. Tolen, 143 F.3d 1121\r\n(8th Cir. 1998); United States v. France, 57 F.3d 865 (9th Cir.\r\n1995); United States v. Lambert, 995 F.2d 1006 (10th Cir. 1993);\r\nUnited States v. Robinson, 86 F.3d 1197 (D.C. Cir. 1996).\r\nThese decisions rely on guideline commentary squarely in\r\npoint here:\r\nAn \"express threat of death,\" as used in\r\nsubsection (b)(2)(F), may be in the form of an\r\noral or written statement, act, gesture, or\r\ncombination thereof.  For example, an oral or\r\nwritten demand using words such as \"Give me the\r\nmoney or I will kill you,\" \"Give me the money\r\nor I will pull the pin on the grenade I have\r\nin my pocket,\" \"Give me the money or I will\r\nshoot you,\" \"Give me your money or else (where\r\ndefendant draws his hand across his throat in\r\na slashing motion)\", \"Give me your money or you\r\nare dead\" would constitute an express threat of\r\ndeath.  The court should consider that the\r\nintent of the underlying provision is to\r\nprovide an increased offense level for cases\r\nin which the offender(s) engaged in conduct\r\nthat would instill in a reasonable person, who\r\nis a victim of the offense, significantly\r\ngreater fear than that necessary to constitute\r\nan element of the offense of robbery.\r\n\nUSSG  2B3.1, comment. (n.6) (1995) (emphasis added).  Importantly,\r\nthese courts accord the quoted commentary deference as a reasonable\r\ninterpretation of  2B3.1(b)(2)(F) by the United States Sentencing\r\nCommission.  \"The Commission, after all, drafts the guidelines as\r\nwell as the commentary interpreting them, so we can presume that\r\nthe interpretations of the guidelines contained in the commentary\r\nrepresent the most accurate indications of how the Commission deems\r\nthat the guidelines should be applied to be consistent with the\r\nGuidelines Manual as a whole as well as the authorizing statute.\" \r\nStinson v. United States, 508 U.S. 36, 45 (1993).\r\nTwo other courts of appeals have held that the term\r\n\"express\" contemplates nothing less than that the defendant have\r\nunambiguously declared, either through words or unambiguous\r\nconduct, that he intends to kill the victim.  See United States v.\r\nAlexander, 88 F.3d 427 (6th Cir. 1996); United States v. Moore, 6\r\nF.3d 715 (11th Cir. 1993).  Citing one common definition of the\r\nadjective \"express\"  \"[d]irectly and distinctly stated or\r\nexpressed rather than implied or left to inference,\" Alexander, 88\r\nF.3d at 430 (emphasis added)  these courts hold that Application\r\nNote 6 cannot control the interpretation of  2B3.1(b)(2)(F)\r\nbecause Note 6 focuses on the victim's reasonable perceptions, thus\r\nis inconsistent with the guideline language itself, which focuses\r\nexclusively on the literal wording of the threat.  See Stinson, 508\r\nU.S. at 38  (\"[C]ommentary in the Guidelines Manual that interprets\r\nor explains a guideline is authoritative unless it violates the\r\nConstitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a\r\nplainly erroneous reading of, that guideline.\") (emphasis added);\r\nUnited States v. Damon, 127 F.3d 139, 145 n.7 (1st Cir. 1997)\r\n(same).  Thus, declarations such as \"I have a gun,\" or even \"I will\r\nuse my gun,\" are not to be considered \"express threats of death\"\r\nbecause the victim necessarily must supply the ultimate inference\r\nthat the defendant means to shoot to kill, not merely to wound.  We\r\nopt for the majority view. \r\nBefore sentencing guideline language and its related\r\ncommentary may be deemed mutually inconsistent, the court must\r\ndetermine that \"following one will result in violating the dictates\r\nof the other.\"  Stinson, 508 U.S. at 43.  Although the adjective\r\n\"express\" commonly connotes \"[d]irectly and distinctly stated or\r\nexpressed rather than implied or left to inference,\" in the\r\nalternative it may simply mean something which is perceived as\"clear\" and \"unambiguous.\"  See Figueroa, 105 F.3d at 877 (citing\r\nRobinson, 86 F.3d at 1200).  Thus construed,  2B3.1(b)(2)(F)\r\nfocuses not upon the criminal defendant's subjective intent as\r\nexpressed through the literal language of the threat, but upon the\r\nlikely inferences which the victim reasonably might draw in the\r\ncircumstances.  Moreover, nothing in the term \"express\" itself\r\nremotely compels the conclusion that Congress intended the most\r\nrestrictive interpretation of  2B3.1(b)(2)(F).  Consequently, even\r\nif we were inclined to interpret the term \"express\" differently than\r\nthe Commission, we would defer to the guideline commentary because\r\nthe term \"express\" reasonably is construed in context as synonymous\r\nwith \"perceived as clear and unambiguous.\"\r\nThe Sentencing Commission gloss on  2B3.1(b)(2)(F) goes\r\nwell beyond the merely plausible, however; it is an eminently\r\nsensible assessment of the likely legislative intent.  The\r\ncommentary instructs that \"[t]he court should consider that the\r\nintent of [ 2B3.1(b)(2)(F)] is to provide an increased offense\r\nlevel for cases in which the offender(s) engaged in conduct that\r\nwould instill in a reasonable person, who is a victim of the\r\noffense, significantly greater fear than that necessary to\r\nconstitute an element of the offense of robbery.\"  See USSG \r\n2B3.1, comment. (n.6) (1995) (emphasis added).\r\nThe offense of robbery contemplates simply that the\r\ndefendant have subjected his victim to minimal levels of fear or\r\n\"intimidation.\"  See 18 U.S.C.  2133(a).  Courts generally evaluate\r\nlevels of \"intimidation\" under an objective standard:  whether a\r\nreasonable person in the same circumstances would have felt coerced\r\nby a threat of bodily harm.  See, e.g., United States v. Henson,\r\n945 F.2d 430, 439-40 (1st Cir. 1991); see also United States v.\r\nAskari, 140 F.3d 536, 541 (3d Cir. 1998) (en banc); United Statesv. Woodrup, 86 F.3d 359, 363-64 (4th Cir. 1996); United States v.\r\nFoppe, 993 F.2d 1444, 1451 (9th Cir. 1993). \r\nSection 2B3.1(b)(2) identifies six settings, in\r\ndescending order of seriousness, wherein a defendant will be found\r\nto have engaged in something more than mere \"intimidation,\" so as\r\nto enhance the actual or perceived risk to the victim.  SeeLambert, 995 F.2d at 1008 (\"Although coercion and at least implied\r\nthreats are necessarily involved in the bank robbery offense,\r\nexpress threats of death are not.\").  Thus, the Sentencing\r\nCommission determination to interpret \"express threat of death\"\r\nunder an objective, reasonable-person standard, rather than the\r\nsubjective standard advocated in Alexander and Moore, supra,\r\ncomports with the standard for assessing \"intimidation\" under 18\r\nU.S.C.  2113(a).  The remaining question, then, is whether the\r\nnotes Burns passed to the tellers came within the definition of\r\n\"express\" contained in the guideline commentary.\r\nWe would be loathe to hold that a reasonable bank teller\r\npresented with a demand for money stating:  \"I have a gun! \r\nDon't make me use it.\"  would be unlikely to infer that the\r\nrobber was announcing his readiness to use the gun.  Moreover, even\r\nassuming that quibbles as to whether the robber meant to shoot to\r\nkill, or merely to wound, are likely to occur at all to a teller\r\nactually confronted by a bank robber, they simply do not represent\r\ndistinctions of compelling weight under an \"objective\r\nreasonableness\" standard.  As the Third Circuit has observed, \"[i]n\r\nthe calmer atmosphere of a sentencing colloquy, the[se] different\r\nwordings may seem significant; however, in the tense environment of\r\na bank robbery, the differences are truly only semantic and\r\nnegligible.\"  Figueroa, 105 F.3d at 878.  See United States v.\r\nHunn, 24 F.3d 994, 998 (7th Cir. 1994) (requiring that defendant\r\nsay \"I will kill you\" \"discounts real-world uncertainties\").\r\nIn our judgment it is highly probable that an objectively\r\nreasonable person, confronted by Burns' threat to \"use\" the gun he\r\nclaimed to possess unless the teller turned over the money, would\r\ndraw little comfort from any surmise concerning whether Burns\r\nactually had a gun; whether he really meant to use it; and, if so,\r\nwhether he intended merely to wound rather than kill absent\r\ncompliance.  Thus, the coercive power Burns brought to bear in\r\nthese robberies far exceeded the minimal level of \"intimidation\"\r\nrequired under 18 U.S.C.  2133(a), see supra.  See, e.g.,\r\nRobinson, 86 F.3d at 1202 (\"[A] reasonable teller receiving a note\r\nfrom a bank robber would very likely infer that 'shoot' means\r\n'kill'.\"); United States v. Jones, 83 F.3d 927, 929 (7th Cir. 1996)\r\n(noting:  when defendant states he has a gun and will use it,\r\n\"[w]hy would anyone want to assume that he was merely a liar or a\r\nbluffer?\").\r\n                     III\r\n                  CONCLUSION\r\nWe therefore conclude that the Sentencing Commission\r\ngloss on  2B3.1(b)(2) in Application Note 6 warrants due deference\r\nas a plausible interpretation by the agency entrusted by Congress\r\nwith the responsibility to administer the guidelines and that the\r\nBurns threats in this case came within the definition of \"express\r\nthreat\" adopted by the Commission.\r\nAffirmed.\r\n        - Dissenting opinion follows -\r\n\nLYNCH, Circuit Judge, dissenting.  I respectfully dissent\r\nfrom the well-crafted majority opinion, joining instead the\r\nreasoning of the Eleventh Circuit in United States v. Tuck, 964\r\nF.2d 1079 (11th Cir. 1992), of the Sixth Circuit in United Statesv. Alexander, 88 F.3d 427 (6th Cir. 1996), of Judge Easterbrook,\r\ndissenting in United States v. Hunn, 24 F.3d 994 (7th Cir. 1994),\r\nof Judge Becker, dissenting in United States v. Figueroa, 105 F.3d\r\n874 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 1860 (1997), and of Judge\r\nArnold, dissenting in United States v. Cadotte, 57 F.3d 661 (8th\r\nCir. 1995).  Given the forceful and clear expressions of the\r\nrationale in those opinions, I add only a few words.\r\nThe issue is whether a note, handed by the defendant bank\r\nrobber to a teller, constitutes an \"express threat of death.\"  The\r\nnote read: \"I have a gun!  Don't make me use it.\"  No gun was seen\r\nor otherwise gestured to, so the issue entirely turns on the words\r\nof the note.  If the note is an express threat, then an additional\r\ntwo levels, or a range of 14 to 18 months, were properly added by\r\nthe district court to the sentence.\r\nThe common definition of an \"express\" threat is a threat\r\nwhich is \"definitely and explicitly stated,\"  The American Heritage\r\nDictionary (2d College ed. 1985), or \"distinctly stated or\r\nexpressed rather than implied or left to inference,\"  Webster's\r\nThird New International Dictionary 803 (1993), or \"clear; definite;\r\nexplicit; unmistakable; not dubious or ambiguous,\" Black's Law\r\nDictionary 691 (4th ed. 1951).  By any common understanding of the\r\nterm \"express threat of death,\" this note was not such a threat.\r\nNevertheless, the majority and several other circuits are\r\npersuaded by the commentary to the Guidelines, as the majority\r\nopinion skillfully explains.  But the Commission in the guise of\r\ncommentary is not free to change the meaning of the Guidelines, seeStinson v. United States, 508 U.S. 36, 43 (1993), and that, on the\r\nfacts of this case, is what is happening here.  As Chief Justice\r\nJohn Marshall said almost one hundred and eighty years ago:  \"Where\r\nthere is no ambiguity in the words, there is no room for\r\nconstruction. The case must be a strong one indeed, which would\r\njustify a Court in departing from the plain meaning of words,\r\nespecially in a penal act, in search of an intention which the\r\nwords themselves did not suggest. To determine that a case is\r\nwithin the intention of a statute, its language must authorise us\r\nto say so.\"  United States v. Wiltberger, 18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) 76,\r\n95-96 (1820).\r\nWhat harm is there in this?  The harm to Burns is\r\nconcrete   more time in prison.  There is harm to the law as well. \r\nOne harm is that articulated by Judge Easterbrook   that this\r\nGuideline is part of a series of sanctions meant to gradate degrees\r\nof threats, and this result \"dissolves the difference\" in degree. \r\nSee Hunn, 24 F.3d at 999 (Easterbrook, J., dissenting).  The intent\r\nof this particular law is thus perverted.\r\nAnother harm is even more fundamental and is to the\r\nstructure of the law.  The law should mean what it says.  The\r\nSupreme Court has weighed the constitutional effects of laws by\r\ntaking them to mean what they say, finding that the appropriate\r\nmeasure.  See Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360, 374 (1963)\r\n(invalidating state-mandated oath of office and replying to state's\r\ncontention   that people would not decline to take the oath out of\r\nfear because there was little reason to fear prosecution   by\r\nsaying that \"[t]his contention ignores not only the effect of the\r\noath on those who will not solemnly swear unless they can do so\r\nhonestly and without prevarication and reservation, but also its\r\neffect on those who believe the written law means what it says.\"). \r\nIf the law does not mean what it says, as has happened here, then\r\nit has failed to meet one of the most basic requirements for any\r\nfair and just legal system.\r\n",

See United States v. Figueroa, 105 F.3d 874 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 1860, 137 L.Ed.2d 1061 (1997);  United States v. Murray, 65 F.3d 1161 (4th Cir.1995);  United States v.

For example, an oral or written demand using words such as \"Give me the money or I will kill you,\" \"Give me the money or I will pull the pin on the grenade I have in my pocket,\" \"Give me the money or I will shoot you,\" \"Give me your money or else (where defendant draws his hand across his throat in a slashing motion)\", \"Give me your money or you are dead\" would constitute an express threat of death.  The court should consider that the intent of the underlying provision is to provide an increased offense level for cases in which the offender(s) engaged in conduct that would instill in a reasonable person, who is a victim of the offense, significantly greater fear than that necessary to constitute an element of the offense of robbery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">USSG &#167; 2B3.1, comment.  (n.6) (1995) (emphasis added).  Importantly, these courts accord the quoted commentary deference as a reasonable interpretation of &#167; 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) by the United States Sentencing Commission.  \"The Commission, after all, drafts the guidelines as well as the commentary interpreting them, so we can presume that the interpretations of the guidelines contained in the commentary represent the most accurate indications of how the Commission deems that the guidelines should be applied to be consistent with the Guidelines Manual as a whole as well as the authorizing statute.\"  Stinson v. United States, 508 U.S. 36, 45, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two other courts of appeals have held that the term \"express\" contemplates nothing less than that the defendant have unambiguously declared, either through words or unambiguous conduct, that he intends to kill the victim.  See United States v. Alexander, 88 F.3d 427 (6th Cir.1996);  United States v. Moore, 6 F.3d 715 (11th Cir.1993).  Citing one common definition of the adjective \"express\"--\"[d]irectly and distinctly stated or expressed rather than implied or left to inference,\" \" Alexander, 88 F.3d at 430 (emphasis added)--these courts hold that Application Note 6 cannot control the interpretation of &#167; 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) because Note 6 focuses on the victim's reasonable perceptions, thus is inconsistent with the guideline language itself, which focuses exclusively on the literal wording of the threat.  See Stinson, 508 U.S. at 38, 113 S.Ct. 1913 (\"[C]ommentary in the Guidelines Manual that interprets or explains a guideline is authoritative unless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous reading of, that guideline.\")  (emphasis added);  United States v. Damon, 127 F.3d 139, 145 n. 7 (1st Cir.1997) (same).  Thus, declarations such as \"I have a gun,\" or even \"I will use my gun,\" are not to be considered \"express threats of death\" because the victim necessarily must supply the ultimate inference that the defendant means to shoot to kill, not merely to wound.  We opt for the majority view.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before sentencing guideline language and its related commentary may be deemed mutually inconsistent, the court must determine that \"following one will result in violating the dictates of the other.\"  Stinson, 508 U.S. at 43, 113 S.Ct. 1913.   Although the adjective \"express\" commonly connotes \"[d]irectly and distinctly stated or expressed rather than implied or left to inference,\" in the alternative it may simply mean something which is perceived as \"clear\" and \"unambiguous.\"   See Figueroa, 105 F.3d at 877 (citing Robinson, 86 F.3d at 1200).   Thus construed, &#167; 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) focuses not upon the criminal defendant's subjective intent as expressed through the literal language of the threat, but upon the likely inferences which the victim reasonably might draw in the circumstances.  Moreover, nothing in the term \"express\" itself remotely compels the conclusion that Congress intended the most restrictive interpretation of &#167; 2B3.1(b)(2)(F).  Consequently, even if we were inclined to interpret the term \"express\" differently than the Commission, we would defer to the guideline commentary because the term \"express\" reasonably is construed in context as synonymous with \"perceived as clear and unambiguous.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sentencing Commission gloss on &#167; 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) goes well beyond the merely plausible, however;  it is an eminently sensible assessment of the likely legislative intent.  The commentary instructs that \"[t]he court should consider that the intent of [&#167; 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) ] is to provide an increased offense level for cases in which the offender(s) engaged in conduct that would instill in a reasonable person, who is a victim of the offense, significantly greater fear than that necessary to constitute an element of the offense of robbery.\"   See USSG &#167; 2B3.1, comment.

Courts generally evaluate levels of \"intimidation\" under an objective standard:  whether a reasonable person in the same circumstances would have felt coerced by a threat of bodily harm.  See, e.g., United States v. Henson, 945 F.2d 430, 439-40 (1st Cir.1991);  see also United States v. Askari, 140 F.3d 536, 541 (3d Cir.1998) (en banc);  United States v. Woodrup, 86 F.3d 359, 363-64 (4th Cir.1996);  United States v. Foppe, 993 F.2d 1444, 1451 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 2B3.1(b)(2) identifies six settings, in descending order of seriousness, wherein a defendant will be found to have engaged in something more than mere \"intimidation,\" so as to enhance the actual or perceived risk to the victim.  See Lambert, 995 F.2d at 1008 (\"Although coercion and at least implied threats are necessarily involved in the bank robbery offense, express threats of death are not.\").  Thus, the Sentencing Commission determination to interpret \"express threat of death\" under an objective, reasonable-person standard, rather than the subjective standard advocated in Alexander and Moore, supra, comports with the standard for assessing \"intimidation\" under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2113(a).  The remaining question, then, is whether the notes Burns passed to the tellers came within the definition of \"express\" contained in the guideline commentary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We would be loathe to hold that a reasonable bank teller--presented with a demand for money stating:  \"I have a gun! Don't make me use it.\"--would be unlikely to infer that the robber was announcing his readiness to use the gun.  Moreover, even assuming that quibbles as to whether the robber meant to shoot to kill, or merely to wound, are likely to occur at all to a teller actually confronted by a bank robber, they simply do not represent distinctions of compelling weight under an \"objective reasonableness\" standard.  As the Third Circuit has observed, \"[i]n the calmer atmosphere of a sentencing colloquy, the[se] different wordings may seem significant;  however, in the tense environment of a bank robbery, the differences are truly only semantic and negligible.\"  Figueroa, 105 F.3d at 878.   See United States v. Hunn, 24 F.3d 994, 998 (7th Cir.1994) (requiring that defendant say \"I will kill you\" \"discounts real-world uncertainties\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our judgment it is highly probable that an objectively reasonable person, confronted by Burns' threat to \"use\" the gun he claimed to possess unless the teller turned over the money, would draw little comfort from any surmise concerning whether Burns actually had a gun;  whether he really meant to use it;  and, if so, whether he intended merely to wound rather than kill absent compliance.  Thus, the coercive power Burns brought to bear in these robberies far exceeded the minimal level of \"intimidation\" required under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2133(a), see supra.  See, e.g., Robinson, 86 F.3d at 1202 (\"[A] reasonable teller receiving a note from a bank robber would very likely infer that 'shoot' means 'kill'.\");  United States v. Jones, 83 F.3d 927, 929 (7th Cir.1996) (noting:  when defendant states he has a gun and will use it, \"[w]hy would anyone want to assume that he was merely a liar or a bluffer?\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore conclude that the Sentencing Commission gloss on &#167; 2B3.1(b)(2) in Application Note 6 warrants due deference as a plausible interpretation by the agency entrusted by Congress with the responsibility to administer the guidelines and that the Burns threats in this case came within the definition of \"express threat\" adopted by the Commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LYNCH, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I respectfully dissent from the well-crafted majority opinion, joining instead the reasoning of the Eleventh Circuit in United States v. Tuck, 964 F.2d 1079 (11th Cir.1992), of the Sixth Circuit in United States v. Alexander, 88 F.3d 427 (6th Cir.1996), of Judge Easterbrook, dissenting in United States v.

Given the forceful and clear expressions of the rationale in those opinions, I add only a few words.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue is whether a note, handed by the defendant bank robber to a teller, constitutes an \"express threat of death.\"   The note read:  \"I have a gun!   Don't make me use it.\"   No gun was seen or otherwise gestured to, so the issue entirely turns on the words of the note.  If the note is an express threat, then an additional two levels, or a range of 14 to 18 months, were properly added by the district court to the sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The common definition of an \"express\" threat is a threat which is \"definitely and explicitly stated,\" The American Heritage Dictionary (2d College ed.1985), or \"distinctly stated or expressed rather than implied or left to inference,\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary 803 (1993), or \"clear;  definite;  explicit;  unmistakable;  not dubious or ambiguous,\" Black's Law Dictionary 691 (4th ed.1951).  By any common understanding of the term \"express threat of death,\" this note was not such a threat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the majority and several other circuits are persuaded by the commentary to the Guidelines, as the majority opinion skillfully explains.  But the Commission in the guise of commentary is not free to change the meaning of the Guidelines, see Stinson v. United States, 508 U.S. 36, 43, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993), and that, on the facts of this case, is what is happening here.  As Chief Justice John Marshall said almost one hundred and eighty years ago:  \"Where there is no ambiguity in the words, there is no room for construction.  The case must be a strong one indeed, which would justify a Court in departing from the plain meaning of words, especially in a penal act, in search of an intention which the words themselves did not suggest.  To determine that a case is within the intention of a statute, its language must authorize us to say so.\"  United States v. Wiltberger, 18 U.S.  (5 Wheat.) 76, 95-96, 5 L.Ed. 37 (1820).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What harm is there in this?   The harm to Burns is concrete--more time in prison.  There is harm to the law as well.  One harm is that articulated by Judge Easterbrook--that this Guideline is part of a series of sanctions meant to gradate degrees of threats, and this result \"dissolves the difference\" in degree.  See Hunn, 24 F.3d at 999 (Easterbrook, J., dissenting).  The intent of this particular law is thus perverted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another harm is even more fundamental and is to the structure of the law.  The law should mean what it says.  The Supreme Court has weighed the constitutional effects of laws by taking them to mean what they say, finding that the appropriate measure.  See Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360, 374, 84 S.Ct. 1316, 12 L.Ed.2d 377 (1964) (invalidating state-mandated oath of office and replying to state's contention--that people would not decline to take the oath out of fear because there was little reason to fear prosecution--by saying that \"[t]his contention ignores not only the effect of the oath on those who will not solemnly swear unless they can do so honestly and without prevarication and reservation, but also its effect on those who believe the written law means what it says.\").  If the law does not mean what it says, as has happened here, then it has failed to meet one of the most basic requirements for any fair and just legal system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although Burns was sentenced under the 1995 version, whereas the current version of &#167; 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) no longer includes the term \"express,\" the dispute as to whether the amendment is substantive or merely declarative of preexisting law turns entirely on the correct meaning of the 1995 version, see infra</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We respectfully acknowledge that the majority view on the proper interpretation of \"express threat of death\" has provoked vigorous dissents from able jurists.  See Figueroa, 105 F.3d at 880 (Becker, J., dissenting);  United States v. Hunn, 24 F.3d 994, 999 (7th Cir.1994) (Easterbrook, J., dissenting).  We note, nonetheless, that in both cases the defendants stated:  \"I have a gun.\"   Unlike Burns, neither defendant asserted an intention to \"use\" the gun.  Thus, we have no occasion to consider whether the specific threats employed in those cases constituted \"express threat[s] of death.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Don't make me use it.\"   After the government charged Burns with two counts of bank robbery, see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2113(a), the parties arrived at a plea agreement whereby the government promised to refrain, \"at sentencing,\" from recommending that Burns receive the two-level enhancement under &#167; 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) for making \"express threat[s] of death\" during the robberies.  Although the government abided by its agreement, the district court nevertheless elected to impose the two-level enhancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. The Scope of the Plea Agreement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before addressing the merits, we turn to Burns' motion to strike the government's brief on appeal.  Burns insists that the government cannot be heard to contend on appeal that the district court correctly imposed the very sentencing enhancement which the government, pursuant to the plea agreement, agreed to refrain from recommending \"at sentencing,\" see Plea Agreement p 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge concerns regarding the government's ambivalence, especially since a commonsense understanding of the language of the plea agreement itself offers little hint that the parties mutually contemplated that the government remained free to advocate a two-level enhancement on appeal.

See United States v. Alexander, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"721346\"><a href=\"/opinion/721346/united-states-v-ernest-alexander/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">427</span></a></span> (6th Cir.1996);  United States v.

Citing one common definition of the adjective \"express\"--\"[d]irectly and distinctly stated or expressed rather than implied or left to inference,\" \" Alexander, 88 F.3d at 430 (emphasis added)--these courts hold that Application Note 6 cannot control the interpretation of &#167; 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) because Note 6 focuses on the victim's reasonable perceptions, thus is inconsistent with the guideline language itself, which focuses exclusively on the literal wording of the threat.  See Stinson, 508 U.S. at 38, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112854\"><a href=\"/opinion/112854/stinson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Thus, declarations such as \"I have a gun,\" or even \"I will use my gun,\" are not to be considered \"express threats of death\" because the victim necessarily must supply the ultimate inference that the defendant means to shoot to kill, not merely to wound.  We opt for the majority view.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before sentencing guideline language and its related commentary may be deemed mutually inconsistent, the court must determine that \"following one will result in violating the dictates of the other.\"  Stinson, 508 U.S. at 43, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112854\"><a href=\"/opinion/112854/stinson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Although the adjective \"express\" commonly connotes \"[d]irectly and distinctly stated or expressed rather than implied or left to inference,\" in the alternative it may simply mean something which is perceived as \"clear\" and \"unambiguous.\"   See Figueroa, 105 F.3d at 877 (citing Robinson, 86 F.3d at 1200).   Thus construed, &#167; 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) focuses not upon the criminal defendant's subjective intent as expressed through the literal language of the threat, but upon the likely inferences which the victim reasonably might draw in the circumstances.  Moreover, nothing in the term \"express\" itself remotely compels the conclusion that Congress intended the most restrictive interpretation of &#167; 2B3.1(b)(2)(F).  Consequently, even if we were inclined to interpret the term \"express\" differently than the Commission, we would defer to the guideline commentary because the term \"express\" reasonably is construed in context as synonymous with \"perceived as clear and unambiguous.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sentencing Commission gloss on &#167; 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) goes well beyond the merely plausible, however;  it is an eminently sensible assessment of the likely legislative intent.  The commentary instructs that \"[t]he court should consider that the intent of [&#167; 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) ] is to provide an increased offense level for cases in which the offender(s) engaged in conduct that would instill in a reasonable person, who is a victim of the offense, significantly greater fear than that necessary to constitute an element of the offense of robbery.\"   See USSG &#167; 2B3.1, comment.

Courts generally evaluate levels of \"intimidation\" under an objective standard:  whether a reasonable person in the same circumstances would have felt coerced by a threat of bodily harm.

See Lambert, 995 F.2d at 1008 (\"Although coercion and at least implied threats are necessarily involved in the bank robbery offense, express threats of death are not.\").  Thus, the Sentencing Commission determination to interpret \"express threat of death\" under an objective, reasonable-person standard, rather than the subjective standard advocated in Alexander and Moore, supra, comports with the standard for assessing \"intimidation\" under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2113(a).  The remaining question, then, is whether the notes Burns passed to the tellers came within the definition of \"express\" contained in the guideline commentary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We would be loathe to hold that a reasonable bank teller--presented with a demand for money stating:  \"I have a gun! Don't make me use it.\"--would be unlikely to infer that the robber was announcing his readiness to use the gun.  Moreover, even assuming that quibbles as to whether the robber meant to shoot to kill, or merely to wound, are likely to occur at all to a teller actually confronted by a bank robber, they simply do not represent distinctions of compelling weight under an \"objective reasonableness\" standard.  As the Third Circuit has observed, \"[i]n the calmer atmosphere of a sentencing colloquy, the[se] different wordings may seem significant;  however, in the tense environment of a bank robbery, the differences are truly only semantic and negligible.\"  Figueroa, 105 F.3d at 878.   See United States v. Hunn, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"670575\"><a href=\"/opinion/670575/united-states-v-andrew-l-hunn/\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">994</span></a></span>, 998 (7th Cir.1994) (requiring that defendant say \"I will kill you\" \"discounts real-world uncertainties\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our judgment it is highly probable that an objectively reasonable person, confronted by Burns' threat to \"use\" the gun he claimed to possess unless the teller turned over the money, would draw little comfort from any surmise concerning whether Burns actually had a gun;  whether he really meant to use it;  and, if so, whether he intended merely to wound rather than kill absent compliance.  Thus, the coercive power Burns brought to bear in these robberies far exceeded the minimal level of \"intimidation\" required under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2133(a), see supra.  See, e.g., Robinson, 86 F.3d at 1202 (\"[A] reasonable teller receiving a note from a bank robber would very likely infer that 'shoot' means 'kill'.\");  United States v.

Don't make me use it.\"   No gun was seen or otherwise gestured to, so the issue entirely turns on the words of the note.  If the note is an express threat, then an additional two levels, or a range of 14 to 18 months, were properly added by the district court to the sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The common definition of an \"express\" threat is a threat which is \"definitely and explicitly stated,\" The American Heritage Dictionary (2d College ed.1985), or \"distinctly stated or expressed rather than implied or left to inference,\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary 803 (1993), or \"clear;  definite;  explicit;  unmistakable;  not dubious or ambiguous,\" Black's Law Dictionary 691 (4th ed.1951).

As Chief Justice John Marshall said almost one hundred and eighty years ago:  \"Where there is no ambiguity in the words, there is no room for construction.  The case must be a strong one indeed, which would justify a Court in departing from the plain meaning of words, especially in a penal act, in search of an intention which the words themselves did not suggest.  To determine that a case is within the intention of a statute, its language must authorize us to say so.\"  United States v.

The harm to Burns is concrete--more time in prison.  There is harm to the law as well.  One harm is that articulated by Judge Easterbrook--that this Guideline is part of a series of sanctions meant to gradate degrees of threats, and this result \"dissolves the difference\" in degree.  See Hunn, 24 F.3d at 999 (Easterbrook, J., dissenting).

If the law does not mean what it says, as has happened here, then it has failed to meet one of the most basic requirements for any fair and just legal system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although Burns was sentenced under the 1995 version, whereas the current version of &#167; 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) no longer includes the term \"express,\" the dispute as to whether the amendment is substantive or merely declarative of preexisting law turns entirely on the correct meaning of the 1995 version, see infra</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We respectfully acknowledge that the majority view on the proper interpretation of \"express threat of death\" has provoked vigorous dissents from able jurists.  See Figueroa, 105 F.3d at 880 (Becker, J., dissenting);  United States v. Hunn, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"670575\"><a href=\"/opinion/670575/united-states-v-andrew-l-hunn/\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">994</span></a></span>, 999 (7th Cir.1994) (Easterbrook, J., dissenting).  We note, nonetheless, that in both cases the defendants stated:  \"I have a gun.\"   Unlike Burns, neither defendant asserted an intention to \"use\" the gun.  Thus, we have no occasion to consider whether the specific threats employed in those cases constituted \"express threat[s] of death.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
