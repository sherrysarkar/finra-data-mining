Upon  careful  review of  the  briefs and\r                            \r\n\nrecord,  we   find   no  merit   in   defendant's   appellate\r\n\ncontentions.  \r\n\n     First,   the  imposition   of  an  additional   term  of\r\n\nsupervised release was within the district court's authority,\r\n\nsee  United  States v.  O'Neil, 11  F.3d  292, 301  (1st Cir.\r                                          \r\n\n1993), and so  the district court did not  err in refusing to\r\n\nvacate that  term.  We find no reason to depart here from the\r\n\nholding in O'Neil.  \r                             \r\n\n     Second,  defendant was  not entitled  to credit  for his\r\n\nhome detention,  see United States v.  Reyes-Mercado, 22 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n363,  367-68 (1st Cir. 1994),  and so the  district court did\r\n\nnot  err in refusing to  modify the sentence  to include such\r\n\ncredit.  \r\n\n     Because the merits of this appeal are easily resolved in\r\n\nthe government's  favor, we  do not address  the government's\r\n\nobjections  regarding  procedural  waiver and  jurisdictional\r\n\ndefects in the district court and this court.\r\n\n     Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r                               \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n",
