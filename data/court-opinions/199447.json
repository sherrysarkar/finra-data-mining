Nancy Gertner, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                     Torruella, Chief Judge,\n\n                 Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n              and Schwarzer,* Senior District Judge.\n\n\n\n     Jean M. Terranova, on brief for appellant.\n     Patrick M. Hamilton, with whom Donald K. Stern, United States\nAttorney, and Jennifer H. Zacks, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n*   Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.\n\fJune 12, 2001\n\n\n\n\n     -2-\n\f          SCHWARZER, Senior District Judge.     Malcolm Dedrick appeals\n\nthe judgment of conviction and sentence, entered upon his plea of\n\nguilty to two counts of distribution of crack cocaine in violation of\n\n21 U.S.C. § 841(a).   He raises four issues: (1) that the court erred\n\nin sentencing him under the career offender guideline, UNITED STATES\n\nSENTENCING GUIDELINES MANUAL (“U.S.S.G.”) § 4B1.1; (2) that his sentence\n\nresulted from ineffective assistance of counsel; (3) that the court\n\nerred in failing to hold a competency hearing before accepting his\n\nplea; and (4) that counsel’s failure to secure a mental health\n\nevaluation constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n   APPLICATION OF THE CAREER OFFENDER GUIDELINE TO DEDRICK\n\n          Dedrick pled guilty to two counts of the indictment,\n\ncharging him with distribution of crack cocaine on two occasions,\n\nApril 16 and April 30, 1997.    Because Dedrick had two prior state\n\nfelony convictions, the district court sentenced him as a career\n\noffender under U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1.\n\n          Dedrick’s principal argument is that the court erred in\n\ntreating the prior state offenses as predicates of his criminal\n\nhistory, rather than as relevant conduct.     Had the court accepted his\n\nGuideline application, he would have avoided application of U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 4B1.1, which automatically placed him in criminal history category\n\nVI instead of IV and increased his offense level.      His somewhat\n\ntortured argument proceeds from U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2, cmt. n.1\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f(“Definitions and Instructions for Computing Criminal History”),\n\nwhich states that a “prior sentence” does not include a sentence “for\n\nconduct that is part of the instant offense.”   To bring himself\n\nwithin this provision, Dedrick points to the conspiracy charged in\n\nthe indictment, which he says was established by stipulation and,\n\nunder U.S.S.G. § 1B1.2(c) (“Applicable Guidelines”), must therefore\n\nbe counted as an offense of conviction.   As such, it would encompass\n\nthe drug offenses--the conduct on which the prior state convictions\n\nwere based--making them relevant conduct, rather than prior\n\nconvictions for purposes of U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1.\n\n         Ingenious as it may be, the argument will not hold water.\n\nTo begin with, the conspiracy charge was dismissed by the government.\n\nThe straw at which Dedrick grasps is the parties’ stipulation in the\n\nplea agreement that the quantity of drugs attributable to Dedrick was\n\nbetween 50 and 150 grams.   But this amount, as noted in the district\n\ncourt’s meticulous sentencing memorandum, is far in excess of the\n\namounts involved in the offenses to which he pled and for which he\n\nwas sentenced.   Even if the larger amounts in the plea agreement\n\ncould be said to cover other offense conduct, there is nothing in the\n\nagreement or the sentencing proceedings to suggest that Dedrick was\n\ntreated by the government or the court as having participated in a\n\nconspiracy, much less as having stipulated to one.   See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Collar, 904 F.2d 441 (8th Cir. 1990) (holding that where\n\n\n                              -4-\n\fdefendant stipulated to elements of two robberies dismissed by the\n\ngovernment, these offense were properly included in base offense\n\nlevel calculation).\n\n         Once the conspiracy argument collapses, Dedrick’s attack\n\non the sentence fails.   The commentary in the Relevant Conduct\n\nguideline, U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3, specifically provides that “offense\n\nconduct associated with a sentence that was imposed prior to the acts\n\n. . . constituting the instant federal offense (the offense of\n\nconviction) is not considered as part of the same course of conduct\n\nor common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.”     This\n\nguideline clearly precludes treatment of the prior state convictions\n\nas relevant conduct in the instant case.\n\n         Dedrick contends that to the extent the foregoing argument\n\nfails, he was denied the effective assistance of counsel.     He argues\n\nthat counsel was ineffective in advising him to plead to the two\n\ndistribution counts and failing to ensure that the conspiracy charge\n\nwas included in the offense stipulation.   We ordinarily review\n\nineffective assistance claims in collateral proceedings under 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2255, rather than on direct appeal.   See United States v.\n\nMala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st Cir. 1993).   We address the claim here,\n\nhowever, because the record is complete and the facts are undisputed.\n\n         Dedrick’s ineffective assistance claim is without merit.\n\nThe district judge addressed the very issue in her sentencing\n\n\n                              -5-\n\fmemorandum and concluded that offenses which resulted in sentences\n\nprior to the commission of the instant offenses could not be\n\nconsidered related.    To the extent counsel advised Dedrick to enter\n\ninto the agreement to a much higher quantity of drugs than was\n\nattributable to him under the offense of conviction, there was no\n\nprejudice because the sentence was not based on the stipulated\n\nquantity.    Nor has Dedrick shown that his sentence would have been\n\nlower had he stipulated to a lesser quantity of drugs.    Without\n\ndemonstrating a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s error,\n\nthe result of the proceedings would have been different, Dedrick’s\n\nineffective assistance claim fails.    See López-Nieves v. United\n\nStates, 917 F.2d 645, 648 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n             FAILURE TO ORDER A COMPETENCY EXAMINATION\n\n            Under 18 U.S.C. § 4241(a) (“Determination of Mental\n\nCompetency to Stand Trial”), the district court must order a\n\ncompetency hearing “if there is reasonable cause to believe that the\n\ndefendant may presently be suffering from a mental . . . defect\n\nrendering him mentally incompetent to the extent that he is unable to\n\nunderstand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him\n\nor to assist properly in his defense.”    Because no motion was made by\n\nDedrick below, we review for plain error.    See United States v.\n\nGirón-Reyes, 234 F.3d 78, 80 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f         Dedrick contends that because the district court knew that\n\nhe had a “de facto” fifth-grade education and may be “borderline\n\nretarded” and observed his confusion when asked whether he wished to\n\nchange his plea, failure to order a competency hearing was plain\n\nerror and violated Dedrick’s due process rights.    For the same\n\nreasons, he argues that counsel rendered ineffective assistance by\n\nfailing to secure a mental health examination.\n\n         We disagree.   The circumstances described led the district\n\njudge to take pains to ensure Dedrick’s rights were protected.      The\n\njudge inquired whether any collateral challenges to the prior\n\nconvictions were available to the defendant and counsel responded\n\nthat there were none that could be made.    Counsel stated that\n\nalthough Dedrick suffered from some degree of limited intelligence,\n\nin discussing the prior convictions, he had assured counsel that he\n\nfelt he had been advised of his rights and that the proceedings had\n\nbeen proper.   When counsel advised the court that Dedrick may be\n\nborderline retarded, the judge allowed counsel to consult with him.\n\nCounsel then returned with Dedrick and, without further discussion,\n\nthe plea colloquy proceeded.   While at one point, Dedrick showed\n\nconfusion over whether he wished to change his plea, after conferring\n\nwith counsel, he continued with the colloquy and responded\n\nappropriately to the court’s questions.    We are satisfied that the\n\ndistrict judge, after having been assured by Dedrick’s counsel that\n\n\n                               -7-\n\f“I don’t think he is retarded to a degree that he does not understand\n\nthe proceedings here,” did not abuse her discretion in accepting the\n\nplea as knowing and voluntary and not ordering a competency hearing.\n\n            We recognize that a mentally retarded person may be\n\ncapable of understanding the nature and consequences of the\n\nproceedings against him and yet be unable to assist properly in his\n\ndefense.     See United States v. Duhon, 104 F. Supp. 2d 663, 666, 671\n\n(E.D. La. 2000).     There is no evidence that this is such a case.\n\nDedrick also fails to demonstrate that but for counsel’s failure to\n\nsecure a hearing, the course of the proceedings would have been\n\naltered in his favor, e.g., that he would not have pled guilty.       See\n\nHernández-Hernández v. United States, 904 F.2d 758, 761 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).     Accordingly, there is no basis for finding ineffective\n\nassistance for counsel’s failure to move for a competency hearing.\n\n            AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                -8-\n\f",
