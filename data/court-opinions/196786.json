After deplaning  at San Juan\r                                            \r\n\nInternational Airport,  defendants  Amado Fernandez  Ventura  and\r\n\nMilagros Cedeno  were questioned  by Customs agents  and arrested\r\n\nfor illegally  transporting money,  in violation  of 31 U.S.C.   \r\n\n5316.  They filed a motion to suppress all inculpatory statements\r\n\nmade in the absence of Miranda warnings, which was  granted.  The\r                                        \r\n\ngovernment appealed.   Having  concluded that the  district court\r\n\napplied an erroneous legal test, we remand for reconsideration of\r\n\nthe suppression motion under the proper standard.\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r\n\nFacts\r               \r\n\n     Because  of  his frequent  travel  between  St. Maarten  and\r\n\nPuerto  Rico, Fernandez  was  on a  \"lookout\"  list kept  by  the\r\n\nCustoms  Service.     On   November  12,  1994,   after  clearing\r\n\nimmigration,  Fernandez   was  taken   to  a   secondary  Customs\r\n\ninspection  area.  One agent  asked Fernandez if  he was carrying\r\n\nany money;  Fernandez responded \"$8000.\"   Another agent searched\r\n\nhis  suitcase, discovered  women's  lingerie, and  asked whom  it\r\n\nbelonged to.   Fernandez answered \"mi  mujer,\" which colloquially\r\n\nmeans \"my wife\"  or \"my woman.\"   Fernandez was directed  to find\r\n\nher.\r\n\n     Cedeno,  Fernandez's girlfriend, had already cleared customs\r\n\nbut  was  still  within  the  customs  area.    Fernandez,  while\r\n\naccompanied  by an agent, located Cedeno and returned with her to\r\n\nthe  secondary inspections  area.   On the  way there,  the agent\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nasked Cedeno whether  she was  carrying any money.   She  replied\r\n\nthat she was carrying approximately $9,000.  \r\n\n     A  search of the defendants revealed  that the actual amount\r\n\nin  their  possession  was  $16,166.    In  response  to  further\r\n\nquestioning, Fernandez  revealed that  the money belonged  to his\r\n\nmoney  exchange company, of which  he was president.   The agents\r\n\nthen placed the couple  under arrest and read them  their Miranda\r                                                                           \r\n\nrights.  \r\n\n     The  defendants  were charged  with  failing  to report  the\r\n\ntransportation of  monetary instruments  in excess of  $10,000 in\r\n\nviolation of 31 U.S.C.   5316, and making false statements to the\r\n\nCustoms  Service in violation  of 18 U.S.C.    1001.   Upon their\r\n\nmotion  alleging a  Miranda violation,  the court  suppressed all\r                                     \r\n\nstatements made by the defendants after Cedeno  was asked whether\r\n\nshe  was  carrying any  money.   See  United States  v. Fernandez\r                                                                           \r\n\nVentura, 892 F. Supp. 362 (D.P.R. 1995). \r                 \r\n\nThe District Court's Opinion\r                                      \r\n\n     The  district court delineated  four relevant  inquiries for\r\n\ndetermining whether  the rule  enunciated in Miranda  v. Arizona,\r                                                                          \r\n\n384 U.S. 436 (1966), has been violated: \r\n\n     1.   Was the person in \"custody\"?\r\n     2.   Was the person \"interrogated\"?\r\n     3.   Had   the   Fifth   Amendment   right   against   self-\r\nincrimination       attached?\r\n     4.   Had the Sixth Amendment right to counsel attached?\r\n\nUnder the court's analysis, a violation occurs when \"each element\r\n\n(custody,  un-Mirandized  interrogation, and  attached  Fifth and\r\n\nSixth Amendment rights) . . . exist[s] simultaneously.\"\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n     The court considered  each factor.   It stated that  custody\r\n\n\"depends  exclusively upon  whether  a reasonable  person in  the\r\n\ndefendant's position  would have felt  free to  leave.\"   Because\r\n\n\"Customs  is  an inherently  coercive  environment  [in that]  an\r\n\nindividual  is  never  free  to  simply  walk  away,\"  the  court\r\n\nconcluded that  defendants were  in \"custody.\"    In the  court's\r\n\nview, \"interrogation\" was satisfied because \"[t]he parties do not\r\n\ndispute that all of the questioning conducted by Customs officers\r\n\nin this case constituted 'interrogation' as defined and explained\r\n\nin Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U.S. 291 (1980).\"\r                                  \r\n\n     Most of the  court's analysis focused on  whether the rights\r\n\nto silence and counsel had attached.  The court held that \"in the\r\n\ncontext of  Customs interrogation,  these rights attach  when the\r\n\nquestioning has ceased to be purely investigatory  and has become\r\n\naccusatory.\"  Elaborating further, the court explained\r\n\n     [This] has  both an  objective and  subjective element.\r\n     The objective element[]  requires that officers provide\r\n     Miranda warnings when  there exists  probable cause  to\r                      \r\n     make  an arrest . . . . The subjective element requires\r\n     that  officers  provide  Miranda  warnings  when it  is\r                                               \r\n     apparent  that the  interrogating officer's  purpose in\r\n     questioning is not purely investigatory.\r\n\nAs applied in the Customs setting: \r\n\n     when the  questioning extends beyond that  asked of the\r\n     average   Customs  interrogee  at   either  primary  or\r\n     secondary inspection, we  infer that the  interrogation\r\n     has become sufficiently focused upon the interrogee  to\r\n     require Miranda warnings.\r                              \r\n\n     Applying  the  facts to  these  legal  standards, the  court\r\n\nconcluded that the \"interrogation turned accusatorial at the time\r\n\nInspector  Fisher  asked  Cedeno  whether she  was  carrying  any\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nmoney.\"   At that point, the \"investigation  had clearly narrowed\r\n\nto a particular  crime with particular defendants,  based on what\r\n\nwe infer to  have been  substantial, particularized  suspicions.\"\r\n\nAccordingly,  the  court   determined,  all  ensuing   statements\r\n\nviolated Miranda, and were properly suppressed.\r                          \r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r\n\n     The government claims  that the court's  test for a  Miranda\r                                                                           \r\n\nviolation  was legally  erroneous.   Defendants concede  that the\r\n\ncourt's approach was novel, but argue that, taken as a  whole, it\r\n\ncomports  with settled  precedent.   Our task  in this  appeal is\r\n\nstraightforward:  to set  forth the Miranda test as  derived from\r                                                     \r\n\nSupreme Court  and First Circuit  caselaw and assess  whether the\r\n\ndistrict  court followed it.  Our standard  of review is de novo.\r                                                                          \r\n\nSee United States v. Lewis, 40 F.3d 1325, 1332 (1st Cir. 1994).\r                                    \r\n\n     Miranda warnings must be given before a suspect is subjected\r                      \r\n\nto custodial interrogation.  United States v. Taylor, 985 F.2d 3,\r                                                              \r\n\n7  (1st   Cir.  1993).    The   custodial  interrogation  inquiry\r\n\nnecessarily   demands  determination   of   its  two   subsidiary\r\n\ncomponents:   1) custody and  2) interrogation.   See Illinois v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nPerkins, 496 U.S. 292, 297 (1990) (\"It is the premise  of Miranda\r                                                                           \r\n\nthat  the danger  of  coercion results  from  the interaction  of\r\n\ncustody and official interrogation.\").  \r\n\n     The custody determination is the initial and, generally, the\r\n\ncentral  inquiry:  it is \"the touchstone  to the need for Miranda\r                                                                           \r\n\nwarnings.\"  United States v.

This  understanding cuts  against the  potentially\r\n\ncoercive  aspect of the Customs inquiry, and lessens the need for\r\n\nMiranda warnings.        In   Pratt,  we  made  clear  that  even\r                                             \r\n\nsecondary  inspection  does  not   per  se  constitute  custodial\r                                                    \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3   This  is not  an  exhaustive list.   Other  courts  have\r\nidentified other factors significant  to a custody determination.\r\nSee  Sprosty v. Buchler, 79 F.3d 635, 641 (7th Cir. 1996) (citing\r                                 \r\ncases).\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\ninterrogation.    We  acknowledged   that  though  \"[a]ny  person\r\n\nrequired to  submit to a  secondary customs search  may apprehend\r\n\nsome  increased  level  of  official  suspicion[,]  .  .  .  this\r\n\nperception  . . . is  not sufficient by  itself to apply coercive\r\n\npressures equivalent to custodial questioning.\"  645  F.2d at 90.\r\n\nThere,  we found  that  the limited  and  routine nature  of  the\r\n\nquestioning and short duration of the encounter militated against\r\n\nrequiring  Miranda warnings.   The  line between  routine Customs\r                            \r\n\nquestioning and custodial interrogation  is not easily drawn, but\r\n\nit requires careful examination of all the circumstances.  \r\n\n     The  other  component  of  custodial  interrogation  is,  of\r\n\ncourse,  interrogation.   Interrogation  refers to  both  express\r\n\nquestioning  and its \"functional equivalent,\" which includes \"any\r\n\nwords  or actions on  the part  of the  police (other  than those\r\n\nnormally attendant  to arrest and custody) that the police should\r\n\nknow are  reasonably likely  to elicit an  incriminating response\r\n\nfrom the  suspect.\"  Rhode  Island v.  Innis, 446  U.S. 291,  301\r                                                      \r\n\n(1980) (footnotes omitted).  Again the inquiry is objective:  how\r\n\nwould the  officer's statements  and  conduct be  perceived by  a\r\n\nreasonable  person in the same  circumstances?  See   Taylor, 985\r                                                                      \r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nF.2d at 7.4  Here, quite clearly, if defendants were in  custody,\r\n\nthe officers' express questions constituted interrogation.5\r\n\n     In  summary,  Miranda  warnings  ensure that  an  individual\r                                    \r\n\nsubject  to custodial  interrogation has  a \"full  opportunity to\r\n\nexercise the privilege against self-incrimination.\"  Miranda, 384\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. at 467.   To  find custodial interrogation,  the court  must\r\n\nfirst  examine  all  the circumstances  surrounding  the exchange\r\n\nbetween the government agent and the suspect, then determine from\r\n\nthe perspective  of a  reasonable person  in the  suspect's shoes\r\n\nwhether there was 1) a formal  arrest or restraint on freedom  of\r\n\nmovement of the  degree associated  with a formal  arrest and  2)\r\n\nexpress questioning or its functional equivalent.\r\n\n     We  will not  dwell  on all  the  problems in  the  district\r\n\ncourt's  version  of the  Miranda inquiry,  but  point out  a few\r                                           \r\n\nsignificant errors.  First,  the court took the ultimate  factual\r\n\nand  legal question -- were defendants in custody? -- and treated\r\n\nit in  a per se manner:   because travelers \"may  not simply walk\r                         \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4  However, an  officer's knowledge \"'concerning the unusual\r\nsusceptibility of a defendant to a particular form of  persuasion\r\nmight be an important  factor in determining' what the  [officer]\r\nreasonably should have  known.\"  Pennsylvania v.  Muniz, 496 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n582, 601 (1990) (quoting Innis, 446 U.S. at 302 n.8).       \r                                        \r\n\n     5  We note  that not all questioning of  in-custody suspects\r\nconstitutes  interrogation  triggering  the Miranda  protections.\r                                                             \r\nFor   example,  many   courts   recognize  a   \"routine   booking\r\ninterrogation\" exception to the Miranda rule.   See United States\r                                                                           \r\nv.  Doe,  878 F.2d  1546, 1551  (1st  Cir. 1989)  (citing cases).\r                 \r\nRequesting  biographical  information --  name, address,  etc. --\r                                                                        \r\nrarely elicits an incriminating  response and serves a legitimate\r\nadministrative  need.   Id.   If, however,  the officer  seeks to\r                                     \r\nelicit information  that may incriminate, the  exception does not\r\napply.  Id.  We express no opinion on whether this narrow Miranda\r                                                                           \r\nexception applies in the Customs setting.\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\naway from an interrogating  officer,\" they are in custody.   This\r\n\nis simply wrong. Individuals subject  to routine traffic stops or\r\n\ncustoms inspections, circumstances  which are not custodial,  are\r\n\nrarely free to leave  while being questioned by an  officer.  The\r\n\nrelevant inquiry, however, as stated above, is  whether there was\r\n\nan  arrest  or restraint  on freedom  of  movement of  the degree\r\n\nassociated with a formal arrest.    \r\n\n     The court's  further assertion  that \"all  reasonable people\r\n\nwould  agree that  Customs  is an  inherently custodial  setting,\r\n\nregardless  of  the  circumstances  of   the  interrogation,\"  is\r\n\ndirectly contrary  to our  decisions in  Tajeddini and  Pratt and\r                                                                       \r\n\nruns counter  to the proper  approach articulated by  the Supreme\r\n\nCourt.    A  custody  determination  requires  inquiry  into  all\r                                                                           \r\n\ncircumstances surrounding the interrogation.  See Keohane, 116 S.\r                                                                   \r\n\nCt. at 465 &amp; n.11.    \r\n\n     Finally, we note that the court, relying on outmoded circuit\r\n\nopinions, discussed  certain factors,  such as whether  there was\r\n\nprobable cause to make an  arrest and the officers' focus  on the\r\n\ndefendants, which are not relevant to  a Miranda inquiry.  At one\r                                                          \r\n\ntime,  certain courts  found these  factors relevant,  see, e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nUnited  States  v.

See, e.g., Berkemer, 468 U.S. at 442 (emphasizing the\r                                         \r\n\nobjective  nature of  the inquiry).   Indeed,  in light  of these\r\n\ncases,  the  Fifth  Circuit  repudiated  its  four-factor   test,\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nannouncing that  \"[p]robable cause  and focus become  material to\r\n\nthe  custody  inquiry  only  when  they  influence  a  reasonable\r\n\nperson's  perception  of  the   situation.\"    United  States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nBengivenga, 845 F.2d 593,  596-97, 597 (5th Cir. 1988)  (en banc)\r                                                                          \r\n\n(footnote omitted).\r\n\n     Defendants argue that the court's test, taken as a whole, is\r\n\nconsistent  with our precedent.

Accordingly, we remand\r\n\nthis  case to the district  court for application  of the correct\r\n\nlegal test.  On remand, the court may take additional evidence on\r\n\nthe relevant factual issues.

On November 12, 1994, after clearing immigration, Fernandez was taken to a secondary Customs inspection area.   One agent asked Fernandez if he was carrying any money;  Fernandez responded \"$8000.\"   Another agent searched his suitcase, discovered women's lingerie, and asked whom it belonged to.   Fernandez answered \"mi mujer,\" which colloquially means \"my wife\" or \"my woman.\"   Fernandez was directed to find her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cedeno, Fernandez's girlfriend, had already cleared customs but was still within the customs area.   Fernandez, while accompanied by an agent, located Cedeno and returned with her to the secondary inspections area.   On the way there, the agent asked Cedeno whether she was carrying any money.   She replied that she was carrying approximately $9,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A search of the defendants revealed that the actual amount in their possession was $16,166.   In response to further questioning, Fernandez revealed that the money belonged to his money exchange company, of which he was president.   The agents then placed the couple under arrest and read them their Miranda rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants were charged with failing to report the transportation of monetary instruments in excess of $10,000 in violation of 31 U.S.C. &#167; 5316, and making false statements to the Customs Service in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1001.   Upon their motion alleging a Miranda violation, the court suppressed all statements made by the defendants after Cedeno was asked whether she was carrying any money.   See United States v. Fernandez Ventura, 892 F.Supp. 362 (D.P.R.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The District Court's Opinion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court delineated four relevant inquiries for determining whether the rule enunciated in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), has been violated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.  Was the person in \"custody\"?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Was the person \"interrogated\"?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Had the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination attached?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Had the Sixth Amendment right to counsel attached?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the court's analysis, a violation occurs when \"each element (custody, un-Mirandized interrogation, and attached Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights) ... exist[s] simultaneously.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court considered each factor.   It stated that custody \"depends exclusively upon whether a reasonable person in the defendant's position would have felt free to leave.\"   Because \"Customs is an inherently coercive environment [in that] an individual is never free to simply walk away,\" the court concluded that defendants were in \"custody.\"   In the court's view, \"interrogation\" was satisfied because \"[t]he parties do not dispute that all of the questioning conducted by Customs officers in this case constituted 'interrogation' as defined and explained in Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U.S. 291, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980).\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most of the court's analysis focused on whether the rights to silence and counsel had attached.   The court held that \"in the context of Customs interrogation, these rights attach when the questioning has ceased to be purely investigatory and has become accusatory.\"   Elaborating further, the court explained</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>[This] has both an objective and subjective element.   The objective element[ ] requires that officers provide Miranda warnings when there exists probable cause to make an arrest....  The subjective element requires that officers provide Miranda warnings when it is apparent that the interrogating officer's purpose in questioning is not purely investigatory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">As applied in the Customs setting:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>when the questioning extends beyond that asked of the average Customs interrogee at either primary or secondary inspection, we infer that the interrogation has become sufficiently focused upon the interrogee to require Miranda warnings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the facts to these legal standards, the court concluded that the \"interrogation turned accusatorial at the time Inspector Fisher asked Cedeno whether she was carrying any money.\"   At that point, the \"investigation had clearly narrowed to a particular crime with particular defendants, based on what we infer to have been substantial, particularized suspicions.\"   Accordingly, the court determined, all ensuing statements violated Miranda, and were properly suppressed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government claims that the court's test for a Miranda violation was legally erroneous.   Defendants concede that the court's approach was novel, but argue that, taken as a whole, it comports with settled precedent.   Our task in this appeal is straightforward:  to set forth the Miranda test as derived from Supreme Court and First Circuit caselaw and assess whether the district court followed it.   Our standard of review is de novo.   See United States v. Lewis, 40 F.3d 1325, 1332 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miranda warnings must be given before a suspect is subjected to custodial interrogation.  United States v. Taylor, 985 F.2d 3, 7 (1st Cir.1993).   The custodial interrogation inquiry necessarily demands determination of its two subsidiary components:  1) custody and 2) interrogation.   See Illinois v. Perkins, 496 U.S. 292, 297, 110 S.Ct. 2394, 2397-98, 110 L.Ed.2d 243 (1990) (\"It is the premise of Miranda that the danger of coercion results from the interaction of custody and official interrogation.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The custody determination is the initial and, generally, the central inquiry:  it is \"the touchstone to the need for Miranda warnings.\"  United States v. Quinn, 815 F.2d 153, 160 (1st Cir.1987).   Since Miranda, the Court has enunciated several general definitions of custody, but the ultimate inquiry is whether there was \"a formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\"  Thompson v. Keohane, 511 U.S. 318, ----, 116 S.Ct. 457, 465, 133 L.Ed.2d 383 (1995) (quotation marks and citations omitted);  Stansbury v.

Pratt, 645 F.2d 89, 90-91 (1st Cir.1981) (discussing factors in the context of a secondary customs search).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Determining what constitutes custody can be a \"slippery\" task.   See Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U.S. 298, 309, 105 S.Ct. 1285, 1293, 84 L.Ed.2d 222 (1985).   Through case by case development, however, courts have carved out certain circumstances as legally insufficient to constitute custody.   See, e.g., Berkemer, 468 U.S. at 437-40, 104 S.Ct. at 3148-50 (routine traffic stops not subject to dictates of Miranda );  United States v. Tajeddini, 996 F.2d 1278, 1288 (1st Cir.1993) (routine Customs questioning);  Pratt, 645 F.2d at 90-91 (same).   Indeed, in the Customs context, we have stated that questions from officials are especially understood to be a necessary and important routine for travelers arriving at American entry points.   See Pratt, 645 F.2d at 90.   See also United States v. Moya, 74 F.3d 1117, 1120 (11th Cir.1996).   This understanding cuts against the potentially coercive aspect of the Customs inquiry, and lessens the need for Miranda warnings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Pratt, we made clear that even secondary inspection does not per se constitute custodial interrogation.   We acknowledged that though \"[a]ny person required to submit to a secondary customs search may apprehend some increased level of official suspicion[,] ... this perception ... is not sufficient by itself to apply coercive pressures equivalent to custodial questioning.\"  645 F.2d at 90.   There, we found that the limited and routine nature of the questioning and short duration of the encounter militated against requiring Miranda warnings.   The line between routine Customs questioning and custodial interrogation is not easily drawn, but it requires careful examination of all the circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other component of custodial interrogation is, of course, interrogation.   Interrogation refers to both express questioning and its \"functional equivalent,\" which includes \"any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\"  Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U.S. 291, 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 1689-90, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980) (footnotes omitted).   Again the inquiry is objective:  how would the officer's statements and conduct be perceived by a reasonable person in the same circumstances?   See Taylor, 985 F.2d at 7.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Here, quite clearly, if defendants were in custody, the officers' express questions constituted interrogation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, Miranda warnings ensure that an individual subject to custodial interrogation has a \"full opportunity to exercise the privilege against self-incrimination.\"  Miranda, 384 U.S. at 467, 86 S.Ct. at 1624.   To find custodial interrogation, the court must first examine all the circumstances surrounding the exchange between the government agent and the suspect, then determine from the perspective of a reasonable person in the suspect's shoes whether there was 1) a formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest and 2) express questioning or its functional equivalent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not dwell on all the problems in the district court's version of the Miranda inquiry, but point out a few significant errors.   First, the court took the ultimate factual and legal question--were defendants in custody?--and treated it in a per se manner:  because travelers \"may not simply walk away from an interrogating officer,\" they are in custody.   This is simply wrong.   Individuals subject to routine traffic stops or customs inspections, circumstances which are not custodial, are rarely free to leave while being questioned by an officer.   The relevant inquiry, however, as stated above, is whether there was an arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's further assertion that \"all reasonable people would agree that Customs is an inherently custodial setting, regardless of the circumstances of the interrogation,\" is directly contrary to our decisions in Tajeddini and Pratt and runs counter to the proper approach articulated by the Supreme Court.   A custody determination requires inquiry into all circumstances surrounding the interrogation.   See Keohane, --- U.S. at ---- &amp; n. 11, 116 S.Ct. at 465 &amp; n. 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we note that the court, relying on outmoded circuit opinions, discussed certain factors, such as whether there was probable cause to make an arrest and the officers' focus on the defendants, which are not relevant to a Miranda inquiry.   At one time, certain courts found these factors relevant, see, e.g., United States v. Henry, 604 F.2d 908, 915 (5th Cir.1979) (articulating a four-factor test for custody that included these factors), but subsequent Supreme Court decisions rejected this approach.   See, e.g., Berkemer, 468 U.S. at 442, 104 S.Ct. at 3151-52 (emphasizing the objective nature of the inquiry).   Indeed, in light of these cases, the Fifth Circuit repudiated its four-factor test, announcing that \"[p]robable cause and focus become material to the custody inquiry only when they influence a reasonable person's perception of the situation.\"  United States v. Bengivenga, 845 F.2d 593, 596-97 (5th Cir.1988) (en banc ) (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that the court's test, taken as a whole, is consistent with our precedent.   We disagree.   Although there may be tests which, though formulated differently, approximate the proper standard, this is not one of them.   Accordingly, we remand this case to the district court for application of the correct legal test.   On remand, the court may take additional evidence on the relevant factual issues.   See Streifel, 781 F.2d at 962.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The order suppressing evidence is vacated.   We remand to the district court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> This specific formulation was first articulated in California v. Beheler, 463 U.S. 1121, 1125, 103 S.Ct. 3517, 3520, 77 L.Ed.2d 1275 (1983) (per curiam ) and Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U.S. 420, 430, 104 S.Ct. 1136, 1143-44, 79 L.Ed.2d 409 (1984).   It served to clarify the Court's conception that Miranda applied after a \"person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\"  Miranda, 384 U.S. at 444, 86 S.Ct. at 1612 (footnote omitted)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In Keohane, the Court made clear that the ultimate determination of custody is a mixed question of fact and law.   The initial examination of the \"totality of the circumstances\" is factual.   The second inquiry, however--whether, objectively, these circumstances constitute the requisite \"restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest\"--requires the \"application of the controlling legal standard to the historical facts.\"  --- U.S. at ---- &amp; n. 11, 116 S.Ct. at 465 &amp; n. 11</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> This is not an exhaustive list.

Requesting biographical information--name, address, etc.--rarely elicits an incriminating response and serves a legitimate administrative need.  Id.  If, however, the officer seeks to elicit information that may incriminate, the exception does not apply.  Id.  We express no opinion on whether this narrow Miranda exception applies in the Customs setting</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

On November 12, 1994, after clearing immigration, Fernandez was taken to a secondary Customs inspection area.   One agent asked Fernandez if he was carrying any money;  Fernandez responded \"$8000.\"   Another agent searched his suitcase, discovered women's lingerie, and asked whom it belonged to.   Fernandez answered \"mi mujer,\" which colloquially means \"my wife\" or \"my woman.\"   Fernandez was directed to find her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cedeno, Fernandez's girlfriend, had already cleared customs but was still within the customs area.   Fernandez, while accompanied by an agent, located Cedeno and returned with her to the secondary inspections area.   On the way there, the agent asked Cedeno whether she was carrying any money.   She replied that she was carrying approximately $9,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A search of the defendants revealed that the actual amount in their possession was $16,166.   In response to further questioning, Fernandez revealed that the money belonged to his money exchange company, of which he was president.   The agents then placed the couple under arrest and read them their Miranda rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants were charged with failing to report the transportation of monetary instruments in excess of $10,000 in violation of 31 U.S.C. &#167; 5316, and making false statements to the Customs Service in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1001.   Upon their motion alleging a Miranda violation, the court suppressed all statements made by the defendants after Cedeno was asked whether she was carrying any money.   See United States v.

See Oregon v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">222</span></a></span> (1985).   Through case by case development, however, courts have carved out certain circumstances as legally insufficient to constitute custody.   See, e.g., Berkemer, 468 U.S. at 437-40, 104 S.Ct. at 3148-50 (routine traffic stops not subject to dictates of Miranda );  United States v. Tajeddini, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610547\"><a href=\"/opinion/610547/united-states-v-hojatollah-tajeddini/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1278</span></a></span>, 1288 (1st Cir.1993) (routine Customs questioning);  Pratt, 645 F.2d at 90-91 (same).   Indeed, in the Customs context, we have stated that questions from officials are especially understood to be a necessary and important routine for travelers arriving at American entry points.   See Pratt, 645 F.2d at 90.   See also United States v. Moya, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"70717\"><a href=\"/opinion/70717/united-states-v-moya/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1117</span></a></span>, 1120 (11th Cir.1996).   This understanding cuts against the potentially coercive aspect of the Customs inquiry, and lessens the need for Miranda warnings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Pratt, we made clear that even secondary inspection does not per se constitute custodial interrogation.   We acknowledged that though \"[a]ny person required to submit to a secondary customs search may apprehend some increased level of official suspicion[,] ... this perception ... is not sufficient by itself to apply coercive pressures equivalent to custodial questioning.\"  645 F.2d at 90.   There, we found that the limited and routine nature of the questioning and short duration of the encounter militated against requiring Miranda warnings.   The line between routine Customs questioning and custodial interrogation is not easily drawn, but it requires careful examination of all the circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other component of custodial interrogation is, of course, interrogation.   Interrogation refers to both express questioning and its \"functional equivalent,\" which includes \"any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\"  Rhode Island v. Innis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110254\"><a href=\"/opinion/110254/rhode-island-v-innis/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">291</span></a></span>, 301, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110254\"><a href=\"/opinion/110254/rhode-island-v-innis/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">297</span></a></span> (1980) (footnotes omitted).   Again the inquiry is objective:  how would the officer's statements and conduct be perceived by a reasonable person in the same circumstances?   See Taylor, 985 F.2d at 7.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Here, quite clearly, if defendants were in custody, the officers' express questions constituted interrogation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In summary, Miranda warnings ensure that an individual subject to custodial interrogation has a \"full opportunity to exercise the privilege against self-incrimination.\"  Miranda, 384 U.S. at 467, 86 S.Ct. at 1624.   To find custodial interrogation, the court must first examine all the circumstances surrounding the exchange between the government agent and the suspect, then determine from the perspective of a reasonable person in the suspect's shoes whether there was 1) a formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest and 2) express questioning or its functional equivalent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not dwell on all the problems in the district court's version of the Miranda inquiry, but point out a few significant errors.   First, the court took the ultimate factual and legal question--were defendants in custody?--and treated it in a per se manner:  because travelers \"may not simply walk away from an interrogating officer,\" they are in custody.   This is simply wrong.   Individuals subject to routine traffic stops or customs inspections, circumstances which are not custodial, are rarely free to leave while being questioned by an officer.   The relevant inquiry, however, as stated above, is whether there was an arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court's further assertion that \"all reasonable people would agree that Customs is an inherently custodial setting, regardless of the circumstances of the interrogation,\" is directly contrary to our decisions in Tajeddini and Pratt and runs counter to the proper approach articulated by the Supreme Court.   A custody determination requires inquiry into all circumstances surrounding the interrogation.   See Keohane, --- U.S. at ---- &amp; n. 11, 116 S.Ct. at 465 &amp; n. 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we note that the court, relying on outmoded circuit opinions, discussed certain factors, such as whether there was probable cause to make an arrest and the officers' focus on the defendants, which are not relevant to a Miranda inquiry.   At one time, certain courts found these factors relevant, see, e.g., United States v. Henry, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"369242\"><a href=\"/opinion/369242/united-states-v-leroy-henry/\"><span class=\"volume\">604</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">908</span></a></span>, 915 (5th Cir.1979) (articulating a four-factor test for custody that included these factors), but subsequent Supreme Court decisions rejected this approach.   See, e.g., Berkemer, 468 U.S. at 442, 104 S.Ct. at 3151-52 (emphasizing the objective nature of the inquiry).   Indeed, in light of these cases, the Fifth Circuit repudiated its four-factor test, announcing that \"[p]robable cause and focus become material to the custody inquiry only when they influence a reasonable person's perception of the situation.\"  United States v. Bengivenga, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"504895\"><a href=\"/opinion/504895/united-states-v-mary-dangerfield-bengivenga/\"><span class=\"volume\">845</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">593</span></a></span>, 596-97 (5th Cir.1988) (en banc ) (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that the court's test, taken as a whole, is consistent with our precedent.   We disagree.   Although there may be tests which, though formulated differently, approximate the proper standard, this is not one of them.   Accordingly, we remand this case to the district court for application of the correct legal test.   On remand, the court may take additional evidence on the relevant factual issues.   See Streifel, 781 F.2d at 962.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The order suppressing evidence is vacated.

It served to clarify the Court's conception that Miranda applied after a \"person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\"  Miranda, 384 U.S. at 444, 86 S.Ct. at 1612 (footnote omitted)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In Keohane, the Court made clear that the ultimate determination of custody is a mixed question of fact and law.   The initial examination of the \"totality of the circumstances\" is factual.
