Upon\r\n\ncareful  consideration  of  the  record,  appellate  briefs,  and\r\n\narguments in this case,  we affirm the district court's  grant of\r\n\nsummary  judgment to  the defendants  for substantially  the same\r\n\nreasons provided in its Opinion and Order.  See Mojica Escobar v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nRoca, 926 F. Supp. 30 (D.

See  Ayala-\r                                                                           \r\n\nGerena  v.

Appellant,  the non-movant, failed  to come forward  with\r\n\nanything  other than the most conclusory and vague allegations of\r\n\nfalsity, and thus fell far short of establishing the existence of\r\n\na \"genuine  issue for trial\"  with regard  to the falsity  of the\r\n\nnewspaper articles, making summary judgment appropriate.

The newspaper articles giving  rise to\r\n\nappellant's  defamation   claims   were  published   and   widely\r\n\ndistributed, and it is impossible to imagine that for want of the\r\r\n\ninformation   sought  in   her  unanswered   discovery  request,1\r\n\nappellant was unable to proffer any competent evidence tending to\r\n\nshow that any of  defendants' statements were false, in  light of\r\n\nthe fact  that, after  all, the  statements mainly concerned  the\r\n\nappellant's  (and  her  husband's)  finances  --  matters   which\r\n\nappellant should be in a fine position to address.   For example,\r\n\nappellant failed to come forward with  any proof that defendants'\r\n\nstatements  regarding the financing of the purchase of a house in\r\n\nOrlando, Florida,  were false,  when it  is reasonable  to assume\r\n\nthat  appellant possesses  records regarding  that purchase  -- a\r\n\npurchase which she claims she herself made.\r\n\n          With regard  to appellant's invasion  of privacy claim,\r\n\nwe note that the right to privacy  as set forth in sections 1, 8,\r\n\nand 10  of  Article II  of  the Puerto  Rico Constitution  is  an\r\n\nimportant  right that  is  firmly safeguarded  under Puerto  Rico\r\n\nSupreme Court case law.

Nevertheless, as the  district\r\n\ncourt  has stated,  the  photograph of  appellant's house,  which\r\n\nappellant does not deny was taken  from a public area outside  of\r\n\nthe house, does not constitute an actionable invasion of privacy,\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   In  the unanswered  discovery request  that is  reproduced at\r\nlength  in  her   appellate  brief,  appellant  mainly   requests\r\ninformation as  to how  the defendant newspaper's  reporters went\r                                \r\nabout  obtaining  information  about   the  appellant.    In  the\r\ncircumstances  of this  case,  however, such  information is  not\r\nneeded  to  prove  the   falsity  of  the  newspaper's  published\r\nstatements.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nfor  it  is  not  \"unreasonably  intrusive.\"    Dopp  v.
