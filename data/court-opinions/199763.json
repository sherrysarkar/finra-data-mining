Robert E. Keeton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n               Lynch and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Friedrich Lu on brief pro se.\n     Mark N.

After a thorough review of the record\n\nand of the parties’ submissions, we affirm.            There was no\n\nerror in the dismissal pursuant to D. Mass. Loc. R. 203(A),\n\nas that Rule clearly authorizes dismissal of an appeal in an\n\nadversary proceeding where appellant has failed to comply\n\nwith the mandates of Fed. R. Bankr. P. 8006 and 8001(a).             We\n\nsee no constitutional infirmity in the local rule, as any\n\ndismissal under the rule is reviewable by an Article III\n\njudge in the district court, and in this instance was first\n\ndirected by, and then affirmed by, a district judge.                The\n\nbankruptcy court was not without jurisdiction to enter the\n\norder of dismissal, despite the fact that the case was on\n\nappeal to this court at the time, since the appeal here was\n\nan improper interlocutory one.       See United States v. Brooks,\n\n145 F.3d 446, 456 (1st Cir. 1998) (lower court “may proceed,\n\nnotwithstanding the filing of an appeal, if the notice of\n\nappeal   is   defective     in    some   substantial    and    easily\n\ndiscernible   way   (if,    for   example,   it   is   based   on    an\n\nunappealable order) . . . .).\n\n          Affirmed.     1st Cir.
