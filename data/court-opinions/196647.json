Defendant-appellant  Hilda  M. Brown\r                                 \r\n\nappeals from her  sentence on three grounds, all  arising out\r\n\nof her unsuccessful motion for  a downward departure from the\r\n\nguideline   sentencing   range   for   extraordinary   family\r\n\ncircumstances.   We have  jurisdiction to review  appellant's\r\n\nclaims  that  the  district court's  departure  decision  was\r\n\naffected by mistakes of law. See United States v. Webster, 54\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1995).  We affirm.  \r\n\n     1. Fifth Amendment Violation\r                                             \r\n\n     The Fifth  Amendment \"has long been  interpreted to mean\r\n\nthat a defendant may refuse to 'answer official questions put\r\n\nto him in any  other proceding, civil or criminal,  formal or\r\n\ninformal, where  the answers might incriminate  him in future\r\n\ncriminal  proceedings.'\" United  States v.  Perez-Franco, 873\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d  455, 462 (1st Cir. 1989)  (quoting Lefkowitz v. Turley,\r                                                                        \r\n\n414  U.S. 70 (1973)).   The Supreme Court, while interpreting\r\n\nthe privilege broadly, has ruled that it \"must be confined to\r\n\ninstances where the witness has reasonable cause to apprehend\r\n\ndanger from a direct  answer.\" Hoffman v. United  States, 341\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. 479, 486 (1951).  \r\n\n     Appellant  has  failed  to demonstrate,  and  we  cannot\r\n\nconceive,  how any testimony that she might have given at the\r\n\ndownward departure  hearing  could have  been  incriminating.\r\n\nTherefore, her decision not to testify at the  hearing cannot\r\n\nproperly  be construed as an  exercise of her Fifth Amendment\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nprivilege  against  self-incrimination.     Accordingly,  the\r\n\ndistrict court's  consideration of her failure  to testify in\r\n\ndenying the departure did not violate the Fifth Amendment.\r\n\n     2. Credibility Assessment\r                                          \r\n\n     Appellant's second argument is that the sentencing court\r\n\nimpermissibly relied upon  appellant's \"criminal character in\r\n\nthe underlying offense of  conviction\" in concluding that she\r\n\nhad   fabricated  her  allegation   of  extraordinary  family\r\n\ncircumstances.  Appellant is referring here to the sentencing\r\n\ncourt's statement that \"[t]he nature of the offense committed\r\n\nby her points to her skills at deception.\"  \r\n\n     Appellant's reliance upon United  States v. O'Brien,  18\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.3d 301 (5th Cir.), cert.  denied,     U.S.    , 115  S. Ct.\r                                              \r\n\n199  (1994),  is  misplaced.     In  the  instant  case,  the\r\n\nsentencing court did not base its departure decision  upon an\r\n\nassessment  of appellant's worth or rehabilitative potential,\r\n\nsee  id.    Instead,  the  district  court's  comment  merely\r                    \r\n\nindicated that  it considered the nature  of Brown's criminal\r\n\nconduct in assessing  her credibility.   There was no  error.\r\n\nCf. United States  v. O'Neil,  936 F.2d 599  (1st Cir.  1991)\r                                        \r\n\n(affirming  sentencing  court's  refusal to  award  two-level\r\n\ncredit for acceptance of responsibility  and finding \"nothing\r\n\nunlawful  about  a court's  looking  to  a defendant's  later\r\n\nconduct  in  order  to  help  the  court  decide whether  the\r\n\ndefendant is truly sorry for the crimes he is charged with\").\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n     Even  if the  district  court erred  in considering  the\r\n\nnature  of  Brown's  offense,  any error  was  harmless.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nWilliams v.  United States, 503  U.S. 193 (1992)  (remand not\r                                      \r\n\nrequired  for incorrect  application of the  guidelines where\r\n\nreviewing court determines that  the same sentence would have\r\n\nbeen  imposed had  the  district court  not  relied upon  the\r\n\ninvalid factor).  The deceptive nature of Brown's offense was\r\n\nonly  one of several  factors upon  which the  district court\r\n\nrelied  in deciding not  to depart.  It  is apparent from the\r\n\nrecord that the district court would  have denied the request\r\n\nfor  a departure even  absent consideration of  the nature of\r\n\nher offense.\r\n\n     3. Refusal to Authorize Funds\r                                              \r\n\n     Brown's  final argument  is  that  the district  court's\r\n\ndenial without a  hearing of  her request under  18 U.S.C.   \r\n\n3006(A)(e)(1), constitutes reversible error.  A      district\r\n\ncourt's refusal to authorize  funds for an expert constitutes\r\n\nreversible error  only where there is  \"'clear and convincing\r\n\nevidence showing prejudice to the accused.'\" United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nCanessa,  644 F.2d 61,  64 (1st  Cir. 1981).   In  this case,\r                   \r\n\nBrown was able to hire an expert despite the district court's\r\n\ndenial of her request for funds.   We conclude that Brown has\r\n\nnot shown  by \"clear  and convincing evidence\"  any prejudice\r\n\narising from the denial of her request for funds.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n     Accordingly,  appellant's  conviction  and sentence  are\r\n\nsummarily affirmed.  See Loc. R. 27.1.\r                              \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n",

O'Neil, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563643\"><a href=\"/opinion/563643/united-states-v-shaun-k-oneil/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">599</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1991) (affirming sentencing court's refusal to award two-level credit for acceptance of responsibility and finding \"nothing unlawful about a court's looking to a defendant's later conduct in order to help the court decide whether the defendant is truly sorry for the crimes he is charged with\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the district court erred in considering the nature of Brown's offense, any error was harmless.   See Williams v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112704\"><a href=\"/opinion/112704/williams-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span> (1992) (remand not required for incorrect application of the guidelines where reviewing court determines that the same sentence would have been imposed had the district court not relied upon the invalid factor).  The deceptive nature of Brown's offense was only one of several factors upon which the district court relied in deciding not to depart.  It is apparent from the record that the district court would have denied the request for a departure even absent consideration of the nature of her offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Refusal to Authorize Funds</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brown's final argument is that the district court's denial without a hearing of her request under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3006(A)(e)(1), constitutes reversible error.  A district court's refusal to authorize funds for an expert constitutes reversible error only where there is \" 'clear and convincing evidence showing prejudice to the accused.' \"   United States v. Canessa, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"388309\"><a href=\"/opinion/388309/united-states-v-peter-canessa/\"><span class=\"volume\">644</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">61</span></a></span>, 64 (1st Cir.1981).  In this case, Brown was able to hire an expert despite the district court's denial of her request for funds.  We conclude that Brown has not shown by \"clear and convincing evidence\" any prejudice arising from the denial of her request for funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, appellant's conviction and sentence are summarily affirmed.   See Loc.  R. 27.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
