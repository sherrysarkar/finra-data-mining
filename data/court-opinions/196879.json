Defendant-intervenors the town\r                    TORRUELLA, Chief Judge.\r                                          \r\n\nof  Charlestown  (the  \"Town\")  and the  State  of  Rhode  Island\r\n\n(together, the \"State\")  seek a permanent injunction  prohibiting\r\n\nplaintiffs the  Narragansett Indian  Tribe (the \"Tribe\")  and the\r\n\nNarragansett Indian Wetuomuck Housing Authority (the \"WHA\")  from\r\n\nconstructing  a housing complex without obtaining various permits\r\n\nand  approvals pursuant to state  law and local  ordinances.1  At\r\n\nthe heart of the issue  lies the question of whether the  land in\r\n\nquestion is \"Indian country\" as that term is defined in 18 U.S.C.\r\n\n  1151(b).   The district court  found that it  is, by virtue  of\r\n\nbeing  a dependent Indian community,  and so declined  in part to\r\n\nissue  the injunction  sought by  the  State and  the Town.   We,\r\n\nhowever,  find it is not, and so,  for the reasons stated herein,\r\n\nwe reverse in part and affirm in part.\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r\n\n          The district court relied  on the evidence presented at\r\n\nan  evidentiary  hearing  regarding  the  State's  motion  for  a\r\n\npreliminary  injunction, which  evidence  the parties  stipulated\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   This  suit was  initially brought  by plaintiffs  against the\r\nNarragansett  Electric  Company,  a Rhode  Island  public utility\r\ncorporation.   Plaintiffs  asserted subject  matter  jurisdiction\r\nunder  28  U.S.C.     1331  and  1362.    The State  subsequently\r\nintervened  in   the  lawsuit   and  filed  a   counterclaim  for\r\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief  against the plaintiffs, and it\r\nis the  State's counterclaim  that  underlies this  appeal.   The\r\nNarragansett Electric  Company takes no position  with respect to\r\nthe issues  raised by the  State in  this appeal.   We add  that,\r\nbecause the plaintiffs have asserted no claims against the State,\r\nthis action  does not implicate Eleventh  Amendment concerns, and\r\nthe  Supreme Court's  decision in  Seminole  Tribe of  Florida v.\r                                                                        \r\nFlorida,    U.S.   , 116 S. Ct. 114 (1995) is inapposite here.\r                 \r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\ncould serve  as the  basis  for the  district court's  decision.2\r\n\nNarragansett  Indian Tribe  v. Narragansett  Elec., 878  F. Supp.\r                                                            \r\n\n349,  352 (D.R.I. 1995) (\"Narragansett I\").  As the parties raise\r                                                  \r\n\nno challenges to the  district court's findings, we rely  on them\r\n\nas well.3  \r\n\n           In 1991 the  WHA purchased  the land which  is at  the\r\n\ncenter  of  this  dispute (the  \"housing  site\")  from a  private\r\n\ndeveloper.  See id. at 534  (detailing history of purchase of the\r                             \r\n\nhousing site).  The housing site is adjacent to the Tribe's other\r\n\nlands, separated from them by a  town road.  The Tribe's  church,\r\n\nthe long house which  serves as the seat of the  Tribal Assembly,\r\n\nand the  offices where the  tribal government meets  and programs\r\n\nfor tribal members  are administered are all established in close\r\n\nproximity to the housing site; a proposed tribal community center\r\n\nand  tribal health center are to be constructed on the settlement\r\n\nlands as well.  The approximately 32 acres of the housing site is\r\n\nlocated  within the costal zone designated in the State's Coastal\r\n\nResources Management Program (\"CRMP\").   Also, the section of the\r\n\nTown in which the housing site is located is zoned  to require at\r\n\nleast two acres of  land per residential unit, a  requirement the\r\n\nproposed project does not meet, as it will have some fifty units.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2   As  the  district court  noted, the  request for  a permanent\r\ninjunction  we address here  relates only to  the construction of\r\nthe  housing complex.    We  do not  express  an opinion  on  any\r\nremaining portions of the case.\r\n\n3  The parties do dispute whether the  trust application has been\r\nwithdrawn.   However,  as counsel  for the  Tribe agreed  at oral\r\nargument, the record  here simply shows that the  application has\r\nbeen made and not acted on or withdrawn.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nAs the district court noted, although occupancy is open to anyone\r\n\n\"it is contemplated that most,  if not all of the units,  will be\r\n\noccupied by elderly and low-income members of the Tribe.\"  Id.\r                                                                        \r\n\n          The  United  States  Department  of  Housing and  Urban\r\n\nDevelopment (\"HUD\") has recognized the  WHA as an Indian  Housing\r\n\nAuthority, and has provided the financing for the purchase of the\r\n\nhousing site and  the construction  of the buildings.   HUD  will\r\n\nalso  provide  money  both  for  managing  the  project  and  for\r\n\nsubsidizing  the occupants' rent.   The HUD funds  have been made\r\n\npursuant to a  program designed to  provide housing for  Indians.\r\n\nSee The Indian Housing Act of 1988, 42 U.S.C.    1437aa-1437ff. \r             \r\n\n          The  WHA bought the land,  and then conveyed  it to the\r\n\nTribe.  A deed  restriction requires that the  land be placed  in\r\n\ntrust  with the federal  government, for  the express  purpose of\r\n\nproviding housing for tribal  members.  The district court  found\r\n\nthat  the  Tribe  had applied  for  trust  status,  but that  the\r\n\napplication  had not yet been  granted.  Meanwhile,  the land has\r\n\nbeen leased to the WHA, with the approval of the Bureau of Indian\r\n\nAffairs (\"BIA\").\r\n\n          The WHA began construction  on the housing site without\r\n\na  building permit  from  the  Town  or  state  approval  of  the\r\n\nindividual  sewage  disposal  systems (the  \"ISDS\")  serving  the\r\n\nproject.   Nor  did the  WHA \"obtain  any determination  that the\r\n\nproject  is   consistent  with  Rhode  Island's   CRMP  or  state\r\n\nregulations  designed  to  preserve  property  of  historical  or\r\n\narcheological  significance.\"   Narragansett I,  878 F.  Supp. at\r                                                        \r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n354.   The  district  court found  that  the excavation  for  the\r\n\nproject has  infringed on the  Town's drainage easement,  and has\r\n\nthreatened to alter drainage patterns to the detriment of coastal\r\n\nand groundwater resources.   At the same time, however,  the ISDS\r\n\nsystems meet Indian Health  Service (\"IHS\") regulations.4  \"[T]he\r\n\nrecord is silent regarding  the differences, if any, between  the\r\n\nState's building code and  the Tribe's building code or  what the\r\n\nsignificance of any such differences may be.\"  Id. at 355.\r                                                            \r\n\n          To  further  complicate  the picture,  \"[t]he  evidence\r\n\ndemonstrates  that  the housing  site  is in  close  proximity to\r\n\nNinigret  Pond,  a fragile  salt water  estuary  that is  a prime\r\n\nspawning  ground for  several  species of  commercially important\r\n\nfish.\"    Id.    The  district  court  found  that  the  pond  is\r                       \r\n\n\"ecologically stressed\"  already, due  to nitrates in  the ground\r\n\nwater,  and that  the possibility  exists that nitrates  from the\r\n\nWHA's  ISDS systems could reach  the pond \"and  worsen an already\r\n\nserious problem.\"  Id.\r                                \r\n\n          In  its detailed opinion,  the district court concluded\r\n\nthat the  housing site is indeed a  \"dependent Indian community,\"\r\n\nand thus is Indian country  under 18 U.S.C.   1151.   Noting that\r\n\n\"tribal sovereignty is no longer an absolute bar to the assertion\r\n\nof state  authority in  Indian country,\"  Narragansett I, 878  F.\r                                                                  \r\n\nSupp. at 359,  the court carried out a  pre-emption analysis.  It\r\n\nconcluded that  the State's building and  zoning regulations were\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n4   IHS  is an  agency  of the  Department  of Health  and  Human\r\nServices.\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\npre-empted, as was its jurisdiction to regulate the ISDS systems.\r\n\nHowever, it  found that Rhode  Island's CRMP was  not pre-empted,\r\n\nand accordingly  enjoined the WHA  and the  Tribe from  occupying\r\n\nbuildings on the housing  site unless that program's requirements\r\n\nwere  satisfied.  It also enjoined them from interfering with the\r\n\ndrainage easement previously conveyed to the Town.5\r\n\n          We review the grant of a  permanent injunction under an\r\n\nabuse of discretion  standard.   See Caroline T.  v. Hudson  Sch.\r                                                                           \r\n\nDist., 915 F.2d 752, 754-55 (1st Cir. 1990) (noting that abuse of\r               \r\n\ndiscretion  standard  applies to  both preliminary  and permanent\r\n\ninjunctions); cf.

Therefore,  rather than\r\n\nenter  into a  detailed discussion,  we will  simply outline  the\r\n\nessential  structure  of  the  historical  underpinnings  of  the\r\n\nState's first argument.\r\n\n          In  the mid-1970s,  the  Tribe brought  two actions  to\r\n\nestablish  its right  to possession  of lands which  it contended\r\n\nwere  unlawfully held by the State as well as private individuals\r\n\nand businesses.  The ground for its claims was that the lands had\r\n\nbeen   unlawfully   alienated   in   violation   of  the   Indian\r\n\nNonintercourse Act, 25 U.S.C.   177.  See Southern R.I.

Supp. at  802-03 (recounting history  of dispute).\r               \r\n\nThe parties to the dispute settled the claims in 1978 by entering\r\n\ninto a Joint Memorandum of Understanding.  The Tribe relinquished\r\n\nits title  claims, and  in return received  a sum  of money6  and\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n6   The Tribe notes that  it disagrees with the  district court's\r\nstatement that the Tribe received a  payment under the Settlement\r\nAct,  maintaining that there was  neither a payment  to the Tribe\r\nnor  a distribution of money or land to individual Tribe members.\r\nWhether or not  the Tribe received a payment is irrelevant to our\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\neffective  control over some 1,800 acres of land, whose title was\r\n\nheld  by a  corporation (the  \"settlement lands\").   Implementing\r\n\nlegislation  was passed by the United States Congress in the form\r\n\nof the Settlement  Act, and  by the Rhode  Island legislature  as\r\n\nwell, see Narragansett Indian Land Management Corporation Act, 6A\r                   \r\n\nR.I.

In 1988, the Tribe deeded the settlement lands to the BIA,\r\n\nto be held  in trust.  Id.  This court has held that although the\r                                    \r\n\nSettlement Act allows State  civil and criminal jurisdiction over\r\n\nthe settlement lands, with some exceptions, the Tribe nonetheless\r\n\nhas \"concurrent  jurisdiction over, and  exercise[s] governmental\r\n\npower  with  respect to,  those lands.\"    Id.

It maintains that we should interpret section 1705(a)(3)\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nconsideration of the issue at hand.\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nof  the Settlement Act as extinguishing all of the Tribe's claims\r\n\nand  limiting  the  boundaries  of  its  Indian  country.7    The\r\n\nlinchpin  of its argument is its contention that it was Congress'\r\n\nintent  in the  Settlement  Act to  set  definite limits  to  the\r\n\nTribe's  Indian country and  to extinguish  any claim  to greater\r\n\nboundaries, and  congressional intent must prevail.   See Rosebud\r                                                                           \r\n\nSioux  Tribe v.

Such a specific  statute, it\r\n\nmaintains, overrides the general definition of \"Indian country.\"\r\n\n          The Tribe responds with two counter-arguments.   First,\r\n\nit  maintains that the State effectively  waived this argument by\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n7    The  pertinent  section   provides  that  upon  the  State's\r\ncompliance  with the conditions  of the  Settlement Act,  and the\r\nrecognition of the same by the Secretary of the Interior, \r\n\n               by   virtue  of  the   approval  of  a\r\n            transfer  of  land  or natural  resources\r\n            effected   by   this   section,   or   an\r\n            extinguishment   of    aboriginal   title\r\n            effected thereby, all claims  against the\r\n            United States, any  State or  subdivision\r\n            thereof,  or any other  person or entity,\r\n            by  the Indian  Corporation or  any other\r\n            entity presently  or at  any time  in the\r\n            past  known as the  Narragansett Tribe of\r\n            Indians, or any predecessor  or successor\r\n            in   interest,   member  or   stockholder\r\n            thereof,  or  any  other  Indian,  Indian\r\n            nation,  or  tribe  of  Indians,  arising\r\n            subsequent to the transfer and based upon\r\n            any  interest in or  right involving such\r\n            land or natural resources  (including but\r\n            not  limited  to   claims  for   trespass\r\n            damages or claims for use  and occupancy)\r\n            shall be regarded  as extinguished as  of\r\n            the date of the transfer.\r\n\n25 U.S.C.   1705(a)(3).\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nmaking only passing reference  to it in the court  below, without\r\n\nsupporting it  with statutory analysis  or legal authority.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nRodr guez-Pinto  v.

Oneida Indian Nation, 470\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. 226, 234 (1985)).   The Tribe points out that  this is not a\r\n\ntitle action, and that it does not claim  aboriginal title to the\r\n\nhousing  site.   Further, it  notes that on  the face  of section\r\n\n1705(a)(3), the Tribe agreed  to \"an extinguishment of aboriginal\r\n\ntitle,\"   but  there  is  no  express  language  in  the  statute\r\n\nextinguishing  any  right  to  purchase  other  lands.    If  the\r\n\nSettlement  Act did  not abrogate the  Tribe's right  to purchase\r\n\nother lands, the Tribe continues, it did not limit its ability to\r\n\ngain sovereign authority over  such lands that it acquires.   The\r\n\nweight  of this  reading  of the  statute  is heightened  by  the\r\n\n\"distinctive perspective\" from which we view statutes that \"touch\r\n\non Indian  sovereignty.\"  State  of R.I., 19  F.3d at 691.   \"The\r                                                  \r\n\ncongressional intent [to terminate  a reservation] must be clear,\r\n\nto overcome 'the general rule that \"[d]oubtful expressions are to\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nbe resolved in  favor of the weak and  defenseless people who are\r\n\nthe wards of the  nation . . . .\"'\"  DeCoteau  v.

Paternalistic phrasing aside,\r              \r\n\nit is  well established that \"[a]  congressional determination to\r\n\nterminate  [a reservation] must be  expressed on the  face of the\r\n\nAct  or   be  clear   from  the  surrounding   circumstances  and\r\n\nlegislative history.\"  Mattz v.

No\r\n\nmatter how we hold,  the significance of our decision  will reach\r\n\nwell  beyond the confines of the current dispute.  Indeed, in its\r\n\nbrief the State points to at least one pending case  in which the\r\n\nissue arises.   Nonetheless,  we leave this  question, which  the\r\n\ndistrict  court  did not  address  in  its lengthy  opinion,  for\r\n\nanother day.   Regardless of whether  the issue has in  fact been\r\n\nwaived,  we  need  not  establish in  this  dispute  whether  the\r\n\nSettlement Act limits the Tribe's Indian country, as  we conclude\r\n\non independent grounds that  the housing site is not  a dependent\r\n\nIndian community, and therefore  is not Indian country.   Thus we\r\n\nwill wait to  address the  issue on the  basis of more  developed\r\n\ndiscussion  below; while it is  at heart a  question of statutory\r\n\ninterpretation, we  nonetheless prefer to  address the Settlement\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nAct  question at a  time when the  parties, and the  court below,\r\n\nhave addressed it more fully.\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\n                        B.

Here, as the housing site is neither  part of a\r\n\nformal reservation nor an allotment, the present  dispute is over\r\n\nwhether   it  constitutes  a  \"dependent  Indian  community\"  for\r\n\npurposes  of subsection (b) of section 1151, a dispute we discuss\r\n\nat length below.\r\n\n          Before  addressing that  issue,  however, we  recognize\r\n\nthat, as the State notes, section  1151 on its face is  concerned\r\n\nonly with criminal jurisdiction.   Nonetheless, the Supreme Court\r\n\nhas  repeatedly stated  that the  definition provided  in section\r\n\n1151   \"applies  to   questions  of   both  criminal   and  civil\r\n\njurisdiction.\"  Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, 480 U.S. at 207;\r                                                         \r\n\nsee also  DeCoteau, 420 U.S.  at 427.   Elsewhere, the Court  has\r                            \r\n\nsimply defined \"Indian country\"  in civil cases in  terms closely\r\n\nparalleling those of section 1151,  while citing to that statute.\r\n\nSee Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v.

In that case, the\r                                 \r\n\nNinth  Circuit refused to apply  section 1151 to  the question of\r\n\nwhether fee  patented land  could  be taxed  by the  state.   The\r\n\ncourt's  refusal was  based on  the reality  that, on  its terms,\r\n\nsection 1151  is a criminal statute, as well as the fact that the\r\n\ntaxing  power at  issue  was governed  by  a noncriminal  federal\r\n\nstatutory scheme.  Id. at 1215.  The Yakima court  made its brief\r                                                     \r\n\nanalysis without mentioning any of the Supreme  Court cases cited\r\n\nabove.   The State looks  to Yakima as  support for its  argument\r                                             \r\n\nthat to transplant section 1151  into the civil context  would go\r\n\nagainst both the  plain meaning of the statute  and congressional\r\n\nintent.   We  reject the  State's suggestion  that we  follow the\r\n\nNinth  Circuit's logic in Yakima,  since to the  extent that case\r                                          \r\n\nsupports  the  conclusion  that  section  1151  only  applies  in\r\n\ncriminal  cases,8 it  directly  contradicts the  guidance of  the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n8   The parties did not  discuss the fact that  the Supreme Court\r\nhas affirmed and remanded the holding in Yakima, see 502 U.S.  at\r                                                              \r\n251, perhaps because the Court did not directly address the Ninth\r\nCircuit's discussion of section 1151.  That section is cited only\r\ntwice in  the Court's  decision. It  first appears,  without real\r\ncomment,  in  the majority's  summation  of  the Yakima  Nation's\r\nargument  that section 6 of  the Indian General  Allotment Act of\r\n1887 is a dead letter.  502  U.S. at 260 (citing the 1948 passage\r\nof  section  1151  with  its  definition  of  Indian  country  as\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\nSupreme Court.

See Watchman, 52 F.3d at 1540\r                                                          \r\n\nn.10 (rejecting similar arguments).  Aside from the fact that the\r\n\nCourt reiterated  its reliance on  section 1151 for  questions of\r\n\ncivil jurisdiction as recently as 1995, see Chickasaw Nation, 115\r                                                                      \r\n\nS. Ct. at  2217 n.2, we  see no reason why  the Court should  not\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nimpliedly repealing section 6's  jurisdictional grant).  Next, in\r\nhis separate  opinion, Justice  Blackmun notes that  the majority\r\nconceded  that section  6  can no  longer  be read  as  providing\r\nplenary jurisdiction  over Indians who reside  on reservation fee\r\nlands.   502 U.S. at  271 (Blackmun, J.,  concurring in part  and\r\ndissenting in part).   In support of  that position, he  cites to\r\nDeCoteau, 420 U.S.  at 427 n.2, for the premise  that the section\r                  \r\n1151  definition  \"demarcates  [the] general  boundary  of  civil\r\njurisdiction of States.\"  Id.\r                                       \r\n\n   Since  the   Supreme  Court's  opinion  in   Yakima  gives  no\r                                                                \r\nindication that  the Court either agrees with the Ninth Circuit's\r\ndiscussion of section 1151 or is calling its own prior statements\r\ninto doubt, and  since it  has subsequently  reaffirmed that  the\r\ndefinition carries  into an  analysis of civil  jurisdiction, see\r                                                                           \r\nChickasaw Nation,  115 S.

See Narragansett I, 878\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.

We accordingly address  them in\r\n\nthat order, ultimately concluding that  the facts reveal that the\r\n\nhousing site is not a dependent Indian community.\r\n\n                       The Martine Factors\r                                 The Martine Factors\r                                                    \r\n\n          The  Martine factors  mandate that  a court  \"weigh the\r                                \r\n\nnature  of   the  area  in  question;  the  relationship  of  the\r\n\ninhabitants  of  the  area  to  Indian  Tribes  and  the  federal\r\n\ngovernment, and  the established practice  of government agencies\r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\ntoward   the  area.\"    Martine,   442  F.2d  at   1023.    These\r                                         \r\n\nconsiderations  support the  Tribe's contention  by demonstrating\r\n\nthat the housing site is a community.\r\n\n          First,  as  the  district  court  noted,  the  BIA  has\r\n\nrecognized the housing  site is in an area \"in  which 'a distinct\r\n\n[Indian] community has existed since earliest European contact.'\"\r\n\nNarragansett  I,  878  F.  Supp.  at 536  (quoting  BIA  Internal\r                         \r\n\nMemorandum on Acknowledgement of  Narragansett Indian Tribe, July\r\n\n1982, at 9).  While we recognize that fact, however, we also note\r\n\nthat it cannot  be doubted that  the Settlement Act  extinguishes\r\n\nall claim to aboriginal title to the housing site.  See 25 U.S.C.\r                                                                 \r\n\n  1705(a)(3).  This factor, then, does not weigh in favor of  the\r\n\nTribe.    In contrast,  we  do not  doubt  that there  will  be a\r\n\nsignificant relationship between the  inhabitants of the  housing\r\n\nsite and the  Tribe:  indeed, the entire point  of the project is\r\n\nto establish housing  for Tribe members and to serve  as \"a means\r\n\nof bringing  the Narragansetts  back together.\"   Narragansett I,\r                                                                          \r\n\n878 F. Supp. at 356.  This weighs in favor of the Tribe. \r\n\n          Further, some relationship has been established between\r\n\nthe federal government, in the form of HUD, IHS, and the BIA, and\r\n\nthe housing site.  HUD financed the purchase of the housing site,\r\n\nand recognizes the WHA  as an Indian Housing Authority.   It will\r\n\nprovide  monies for the  management of the  project and subsidize\r\n\nthe  occupants' rent,  all  pursuant to  a program  \"specifically\r\n\ndesigned to provide housing for Indians.\"  Narragansett I, 878 F.\r                                                                   \r\n\nSupp. at 354; see  South Dakota, 665 F.2d at  840 (remarking upon\r                                         \r\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\nsimilar governmental  activity as showing \"[f]ederal  concern for\r\n\nthe  [housing] project\").  The district court noted that the fact\r\n\nthat  there is a relationship  between HUD and  the community \"is\r\n\nunderscored  by  the evidence  that  many of  the  occupants will\r\n\nparticipate  in nutrition,  education  and job  training programs\r\n\nsubsidized  by the  federal  government and  administered by  the\r\n\nTribe  on the adjacent settlement lands.\"  Narragansett I, 878 F.\r                                                                   \r\n\nSupp. at 357.  However, we  note that, as we find below,  while a\r\n\nrelationship exists to the extent that these federal entities are\r\n\nactive in the housing site, their  actions do not rise the  level\r\n\nof  setting apart the land for the use, occupancy, and protection\r\n\nof dependent Indian peoples.\r\n\n                           Cohesiveness\r                                     Cohesiveness\r                                                 \r\n\n          We  next   weigh  whether   there  is  an   element  of\r\n\ncohesiveness  in  the  community,  as  demonstrated  by  economic\r\n\npursuits, common interests, or the needs of the inhabitants.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nWeddell, 636 F.2d  at 211  (noting that these  elements are  more\r                 \r\n\nimportant  than  density  of  population,  percentage  of  Indian\r\n\nresidents, or the history and background of the area).  Certainly\r\n\nthis  factor weighs in favor  of finding this  a dependent Indian\r\n\ncommunity:  the project will help the Tribe supply housing to its\r\n\nelderly and low-income  members.9  Further,  the housing site  is\r\n\nin close proximity to the Tribe's church, the seat of the  Tribal\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n9  The  fact that occupancy is actually open  to anyone, pursuant\r\nto  HUD regulations, does not bar finding this a dependent Indian\r\ncommunity.  See  South Dakota, 665 F.2d at 842  (\"The fact that a\r                                       \r\nsmall number of non-Indians reside at the project does not defeat\r\na finding of a dependent Indian community.\").\r\n\n                               -23-\r\r\n\nAssembly,  the   offices  of   the  tribal  government   and  the\r\n\nadministration  of federal  programs --  in short,  it is  indeed\r\n\nclose to the \"center of tribal government, culture  and religious\r\n\nlife.\"   Narragansett I, 878  F. Supp. at  356.  Nonetheless, the\r                                 \r\n\nfact that the housing will  be predominantly Indian in  character\r\n\nis  not enough,  by  itself,  to  establish  the  presence  of  a\r\n\ndependent  Indian  community.   See Blatchford,  904 F.2d  at 549\r                                                        \r\n\n(noting that  fact  that \"Indians  constituted  the bulk  of  the\r\n\npopulation and gave  the area a distinctly  Indian character does\r\n\nnot convert  the community  into a dependent  Indian community\");\r\n\nMartine, 442 F.2d at 1024 (holding that \"[t]he mere presence of a\r                 \r\n\ngroup  of  Indians  in a  particular  area\" does  not  make  it a\r\n\ndependent Indian community).\r\n\n                       Title and Authority\r                                 Title and Authority\r                                                    \r\n\n          We  turn now to the South Dakota factors which focus on\r                                                    \r\n\nwhether the community is in fact a dependent one.   First, we ask\r\n\nwhether the United States  retains title to the housing  site and\r\n\nthe authority to enact regulations and laws.  As noted above, the\r\n\nfederal  government  does not  in  fact hold  title;  rather, the\r\n\nhousing site is held by the Tribe, who has leased the land to the\r\n\nWHA, in a lease approved by the BIA.  While the Tribe has applied\r\n\nfor trust status, as the record stands,  that status has not been\r\n\ngranted.  The  fact that the Tribe, not  the government, owns the\r\n\nland  does not  preclude a  finding that  the housing  site  is a\r\n\ndependent  Indian  community.    See  Sandoval, 231  U.S.  at  48\r                                                        \r\n\n(rejecting the  argument that  Pueblo Indians holding  fee simple\r\n\n                               -24-\r\r\n\ntitle to lands  precludes the lands  from being Indian  country);\r\n\nMartine, 442 F.2d at 1023 (finding that lands purchased by Navajo\r                 \r\n\nTribe from third party, located in an area  which is \"a patchwork\r\n\nof  land, some  of which is  owned by  the Navajo  Tribe, some of\r\n\nwhich  is not\"  and  which is  not within  a  reservation, was  a\r\n\ndependent Indian community); cf. Indian Country, U.S.A., 829 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\nat  975 (noting that patented fee title does not preclude finding\r\n\nterritory is a reservation  where fee title to the  disputed area\r\n\nhad  passed to the Creek Nation by federal treaty).  Nonetheless,\r\n\nthis must weigh against  the Tribe.  See Blatchford  v. Sullivan,\r                                                                          \r\n\n904 F.2d 542 (10th Cir. 1990) (considering, inter alia, fact that\r                                                                \r\n\nprivate  owner  held  land  in  determining  that  land  was  not\r\n\ndependent Indian community, although  it was surrounded by Navajo\r\n\nallotment  land); Weddell, 636  F.2d at 213  (noting, inter alia,\r                                                                          \r\n\nthat although  land was  within the  exterior  boundaries of  the\r\n\noriginal Yankton Sioux Indian Reservation, it was privately held,\r\n\nand  finding that the land  was not a  dependent Indian community\r\n\nfor purposes of criminal jurisdiction).\r\n\n          The second part  of this factor  focuses upon the  very\r\n\nissue   in  dispute  here:    who  has  the  authority  to  enact\r\n\nregulations  and laws.  The State's  authority will be determined\r\n\nby our decision here.  As for  the federal government, the record\r\n\nindicates that it  has exercised  authority in the  form of  HUD,\r\n\nIHS,  and BIA  activity, regulations  and financing.   Of course,\r\n\nHUD,  at  least, can  provide  financing and  set  regulations in\r\n\nother,  non-Indian contexts.  The record does not address whether\r\n\n                               -25-\r\r\n\nthere  is more extensive federal  regulation here by  HUD than in\r\n\nany other HUD assisted, non-Indian project.  Since this factor is\r\n\nlargely  determined by  our  decision today,  we  find it  weighs\r\n\nneither for nor against the Tribe.\r\n\n              Whether the Lands Have Been Set Apart\r                        Whether the Lands Have Been Set Apart\r                                                             \r\n\n          The last  factor we address is whether the housing site\r\n\nhas  been  set  apart by  the  federal  government  for the  use,\r\n\noccupancy,  and protection  of  dependent Indian  peoples.   This\r\n\nproves to be the crucial factor in our discussion.  See Levesque,\r                                                                          \r\n\n681  F.2d at 77 (noting that this  is the \"ultimate issue\" in the\r\n\nfactual analysis).\r\n\n            [T]he test for  determining whether  land\r\n            is  Indian  country  does  not  turn upon\r\n            whether that land  is denominated  \"trust\r\n            land\" or  \"reservation.\"  Rather,  we ask\r\n            whether  the area has  been \"'validly set\r\n            apart for the use of the Indians as such,\r\n            under   the    superintendence   of   the\r\n            Government.'\"\r\n\nCitizen Band  Potawatomi Indian Tribe,  498 U.S. at  511 (quoting\r                                               \r\n\nUnited States v.

Harjo,  Josephine Harjo inherited a restricted\r                                  \r\n\nIndian allotment from her husband, also a Tribe  member.  In 1973\r\n\nshe partitioned four tracts from the larger tract and deeded them\r\n\nto the Seminole Housing Authority, as part  of a federally-funded\r\n\nprogram whereby  Harjo would  make payments  each  month and,  in\r\n\nseventeen years,  would own the house and the land.  Although the\r\n\nUnited  States did  not  have  title  to  the  deeded  lands,  it\r\n\ncontinued its \"superintendence\" of the property for the seventeen\r\n\nyears of the program, a role evident in the comprehensive federal\r\n\nregulations governing the program.   790 P.2d at 1101.   Thus the\r\n\ncourt  found  that  the  government  \"controls  virtually   every\r\n\nforeseeable legal consideration  touching the property  until the\r\n\n[program]  runs its course or  sooner terminates.\"   Id. at 1102.\r                                                                  \r\n\nAlthough HUD regulations apply  in the present case as  well, the\r\n\nTribe  has  pointed  to no  such  comprehensive  superintendence.\r\n\nFurther, although the lands in Harjo were not held in trust, they\r                                              \r\n\nwere  not purchased from third  parties, as in  the present case.\r\n\nInstead, they  were originally part of  Harjo's restricted Indian\r\n\nallotment,  and the  portions of  the allotment  she did  not use\r\n\nremained  restricted, a  much closer  link to  government control\r\n\nthen the Tribe demonstrates here.\r\n\n          In fact,  we  note that,  aside  from Harjo,  the  vast\r                                                               \r\n\nmajority  of cases we have found which analyze what constitutes a\r\n\ndependent Indian community since   1151(b) was enacted find there\r\n\nis such a  community if the land  is held in trust,   Driver, 945\r                                                                      \r\n\n                               -29-\r\r\n\nF.2d  at 1415; Azure, 801 F.2d at  339; South Dakota, 665 F.2d at\r                                                              \r\n\n839;  Mound, 477  F.

Oklahoma Tax\r                                                                           \r\n\nCommission also weighs against finding the housing site meets the\r                    \r\n\n\"set apart\" requirement.   In Buzzard, as here, the  Indian tribe\r                                               \r\n\nunilaterally purchased the  lands in dispute,  and held title  to\r\n\nthem in  fee simple.   Instead of  housing, it set  up commercial\r\n\nsmokeshops  on the  land.  The  tribe claimed  that the  land was\r\n\nIndian  country  because it  had been  set  apart by  the federal\r\n\ngovernment  for  the use  of  the  Indians.   In  support  of its\r\n\nposition, it pointed to a clause  in its charter and in 25 U.S.C.\r\n\n  177 providing that land owned by a tribe cannot  be disposed of\r\n\nwithout  the approval  of  the Secretary  of  the Interior  --  a\r\n\nrestraint on alienation that  the Tribe acknowledges applies here\r\n\nas  well.    The Buzzard  court  rejected  the tribe's  argument,\r                                  \r\n\nfinding   that  a   restriction  on   alienation  by   itself  is\r\n\ninsufficient to make the land Indian country.  \r\n\n            If  the  restriction  against  alienation\r\n            were   sufficient   to   make  any   land\r\n            purchased by the [tribe]  Indian country,\r\n            the  [tribe] could remove land from state\r\n            jurisdiction   and   force  the   federal\r\n            government  to  exert  jurisdiction  over\r\n            that land without either sovereign having\r\n            any  voice in  the  matter.   Nothing  in\r\n            McGowan  or  the  cases concerning  trust\r                             \r\n            land  indicates  that  the Supreme  Court\r\n            intended for  Indian tribes to  have such\r\n            unilateral   power   to   create   Indian\r\n            country.\r\n\n992 F.2d  at 1076.   Of course,  in the present  case we  have an\r\n\n                               -31-\r\r\n\nadditional  element:    HUD  and  BIA  financial  assistance  and\r\n\nsupervision of a housing project that is more clearly tied to the\r\n\ncommunity's benefit than the smokeshops in Buzzard.  Nonetheless,\r                                                            \r\n\nthe court's concern in Buzzard with unilateral creation of Indian\r                                        \r\n\ncountry remains a valid one in this case as well.  \r\n\n          Ultimately,  as in  Buzzard, we  find that  the federal\r                                               \r\n\nrole in the  WHA project  is simply not  sufficient to  establish\r\n\nthat  the housing site was \"set apart\" by the federal government.\r\n\nOur analysis of the facts here, as well as the facts other courts\r\n\nhave found  determinative in deciding whether land  has been \"set\r\n\napart,\" leads  us to conclude  that the district  court's holding\r\n\nthat the housing site had been set apart constituted an abuse  of\r\n\nits discretion.    See  Planned Parenthood  League  of  Mass.  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nBellotti,  641  F.2d  1006,  1009 (1st  Cir.  1981)  (noting that\r                  \r\n\n\"'misapplication  of the law to  particular facts is  an abuse of\r\n\ndiscretion.'\"   (quoting Charles v.

See Levesque,  681 F.2d at 77 (stating  that \"whether\r                                  \r\n\nthe area was established for the use, occupancy and protection of\r\n\ndependent  Indians\" is  the  \"ultimate issue\"  in our  fact-based\r\n\ninquiry).  While the  first two factors we addressed  support the\r\n\nTribe's  contention  that  the housing  site  is  a  community of\r\n\nIndians,  the second two demonstrate that it is not a \"dependent\"\r\n\none.

We, however, find it is not, and so, for the reasons stated herein, we reverse in part and affirm in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court relied on the evidence presented at an evidentiary hearing regarding the State's motion for a preliminary injunction, which evidence the parties stipulated could serve as the basis for the district court's decision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Narragansett Indian Tribe v. Narragansett Elec., 878 F.Supp. 349, 352 (D.R.I.1995) (\"Narragansett I \").  As the parties raise no challenges to the district court's findings, we rely on them as well.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1991 the WHA purchased the land which is at the center of this dispute (the \"housing site\") from a private developer.  See id. at 354 (detailing history of purchase of the housing site).  The housing site is adjacent to the Tribe's other lands, separated from them by a town road.  The Tribe's church, the long house which serves as the seat of the Tribal Assembly, and the offices where the tribal government meets and programs for tribal members are administered are all established in close proximity to the housing site;  a proposed tribal community center and tribal health center are to be constructed on the settlement lands as well.  The approximately 32 acres of the housing site is located within the coastal zone designated in the State's Coastal Resources Management Program (\"CRMP\").  Also, the section of the Town in which the housing site is located is zoned to require at least two acres of land per residential unit, a requirement the proposed project does not meet, as it will have some fifty units.  As the district court noted, although occupancy is open to anyone \"it is contemplated that most, if not all of the units, will be occupied by elderly and low-income members of the Tribe.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") has recognized the WHA as an Indian Housing Authority, and has provided the financing for the purchase of the housing site and the construction of the buildings.  HUD will also provide money both for managing the project and for subsidizing the occupants' rent.  The HUD funds have been made pursuant to a program designed to provide housing for Indians.  See The Indian Housing Act of 1988, 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1437aa-1437ff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The WHA bought the land, and then conveyed it to the Tribe.  A deed restriction requires that the land be placed in trust with the federal government, for the express purpose of providing housing for tribal members.  The district court found that the Tribe had applied for trust status, but that the application had not yet been granted.  Meanwhile, the land has been leased to the WHA, with the approval of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (\"BIA\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The WHA began construction on the housing site without a building permit from the Town or state approval of the individual sewage disposal systems (the \"ISDS\") serving the project.  Nor did the WHA \"obtain any determination that the project is consistent with Rhode Island's CRMP or state regulations designed to preserve property of historical or archeological significance.\"  Narragansett I, 878 F.Supp. at 354.   The district court found that the excavation for the project has infringed on the Town's drainage easement, and has threatened to alter drainage patterns to the detriment of coastal and groundwater resources.  At the same time, however, the ISDS systems meet Indian Health Service (\"IHS\") regulations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  \"[T]he record is silent regarding the differences, if any, between the State's building code and the Tribe's building code or what the significance of any such differences may be.\"  Id. at 355.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To further complicate the picture, \"[t]he evidence demonstrates that the housing site is in close proximity to Ninigret Pond, a fragile salt water estuary that is a prime spawning ground for several species of commercially important fish.\"  Id. The district court found that the pond is \"ecologically stressed\" already, due to nitrates in the ground water, and that the possibility exists that nitrates from the WHA's ISDS systems could reach the pond \"and worsen an already serious problem.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its detailed opinion, the district court concluded that the housing site is indeed a \"dependent Indian community,\" and thus is Indian country under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1151.  Noting that \"tribal sovereignty is no longer an absolute bar to the assertion of state authority in Indian country,\" Narragansett I, 878 F.Supp. at 359, the court carried out a pre-emption analysis.  It concluded that the State's building and zoning regulations were pre-empted, as was its jurisdiction to regulate the ISDS systems.  However, it found that Rhode Island's CRMP was not pre-empted, and accordingly enjoined the WHA and the Tribe from occupying buildings on the housing site unless that program's requirements were satisfied.  It also enjoined them from interfering with the drainage easement previously conveyed to the Town.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the grant of a permanent injunction under an abuse of discretion standard.  See Caroline T. v. Hudson Sch. Dist., 915 F.2d 752, 754-55 (1st Cir.1990) (noting that abuse of discretion standard applies to both preliminary and permanent injunctions);  cf.

The Settlement Act</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The State makes its first argument on the basis of the Rhode Island Indian Claims Settlement Act of 1978, 25 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1701-1716 (the \"Settlement Act\").  We begin with the history of the Settlement Act, and then address the State's contention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The background of the relationship between the Tribe and the State has been addressed in some detail by the district court below, Narragansett I, 878 F.Supp. at 353-55, as well as in prior decisions of the courts of this circuit, see Rhode Island v. Narragansett Indian Tribe, 19 F.3d 685, 689 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 919, 115 S.Ct. 298, 130 L.Ed.2d 211 (1994);  Maynard v. Narragansett Indian Tribe, 984 F.2d 14, 15-16 (1st Cir.1993);  Town of Charlestown v. United States, 696 F.Supp. 800, 801-05 (D.R.I.1988), aff'd, 873 F.2d 1433 (1st Cir.1989);  Narragansett Tribe of Indians v. Murphy, 426 F.Supp. 132, 134 (D.R.I.1976);  Narragansett Tribe of Indians v. Southern R.I. Land Dev.  Corp., 418 F.Supp. 798, 802-03 (D.R.I.1976). Therefore, rather than enter into a detailed discussion, we will simply outline the essential structure of the historical underpinnings of the State's first argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the mid-1970s, the Tribe brought two actions to establish its right to possession of lands which it contended were unlawfully held by the State as well as private individuals and businesses.  The ground for its claims was that the lands had been unlawfully alienated in violation of the Indian Nonintercourse Act, 25 U.S.C. &#167; 177.  See Southern R.I. Land Dev.  Corp., 418 F.Supp. at 802-03 (recounting history of dispute).  The parties to the dispute settled the claims in 1978 by entering into a Joint Memorandum of Understanding.  The Tribe relinquished its title claims, and in return received a sum of money<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and effective control over some 1,800 acres of land, whose title was held by a corporation (the \"settlement lands\").  Implementing legislation was passed by the United States Congress in the form of the Settlement Act, and by the Rhode Island legislature as well, see Narragansett Indian Land Management Corporation Act, 6A R.I. Gen. Laws &#167;&#167; 37-18-1 to 37-18-15 (1990).  See generally Town of Charlestown, 696 F.Supp. at 801-05 (detailing the history and provisions of the Settlement Act).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1983, the Narragansetts were officially recognized as an Indian tribe.  See Narragansett Indian Tribe, 19 F.3d at 689.   In 1988, the Tribe deeded the settlement lands to the BIA, to be held in trust.  Id. This court has held that although the Settlement Act allows State civil and criminal jurisdiction over the settlement lands, with some exceptions, the Tribe nonetheless has \"concurrent jurisdiction over, and exercise[s] governmental power with respect to, those lands.\"  Id. (holding that the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2701-2721, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1166-1168, applies to the settlement lands).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. The Present Dispute</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The State's first contention in the present case is that the Settlement Act precludes a finding that the housing site, which is not part of the settlement lands, is Indian country, because that Act resolved the Tribe's land claims and established the boundaries of the Tribe's Indian country in Rhode Island.  It maintains that we should interpret section 1705(a)(3) of the Settlement Act as extinguishing all of the Tribe's claims and limiting the boundaries of its Indian country.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  The linchpin of its argument is its contention that it was Congress' intent in the Settlement Act to set definite limits to the Tribe's Indian country and to extinguish any claim to greater boundaries, and congressional intent must prevail.  See Rosebud Sioux Tribe v. Kneip, 430 U.S. 584, 586, 97 S.Ct. 1361, 1363, 51 L.Ed.2d 660 (1977) (noting \"that congressional intent will control\" in determining whether a reservation has been terminated).  Such a specific statute, it maintains, overrides the general definition of \"Indian country.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tribe responds with two counter-arguments.  First, it maintains that the State effectively waived this argument by making only passing reference to it in the court below, without supporting it with statutory analysis or legal authority.  See Rodrguez-Pinto v. Tirado-Delgado, 982 F.2d 34, 41 (1st Cir.1993) (reaffirming that \"arguments made in a perfunctory manner below are deemed waived on appeal\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the Tribe contends that even if the argument was not waived, the Settlement Act only extinguished the Tribe's aboriginal title claims.  \"Aboriginal title,\" alternatively called \"Indian title,\" is \"the right of Indian tribes to use and occupy 'lands they had inhabited from time immemorial.' \"  Mashpee Tribe v. Secretary of the Interior, 820 F.2d 480, 481-82 (1st Cir.1987) (quoting County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation, 470 U.S. 226, 234, 105 S.Ct. 1245, 1251, 84 L.Ed.2d 169 (1985)).  The Tribe points out that this is not a title action, and that it does not claim aboriginal title to the housing site.  Further, it notes that on the face of section 1705(a)(3), the Tribe agreed to \"an extinguishment of aboriginal title,\" but there is no express language in the statute extinguishing any right to purchase other lands.  If the Settlement Act did not abrogate the Tribe's right to purchase other lands, the Tribe continues, it did not limit its ability to gain sovereign authority over such lands that it acquires.  The weight of this reading of the statute is heightened by the \"distinctive perspective\" from which we view statutes that \"touch on Indian sovereignty.\"  State of R.I., 19 F.3d at 691.  \"The congressional intent [to terminate a reservation] must be clear, to overcome 'the general rule that \"[d]oubtful expressions are to be resolved in favor of the weak and defenseless people who are the wards of the nation....\" ' \"  DeCoteau v. District County Court, 420 U.S. 425, 444, 95 S.Ct. 1082, 1093, 43 L.Ed.2d 300 (1975) (quoting McClanahan v. Arizona State Tax Comm'n, 411 U.S. 164, 174, 93 S.Ct. 1257, 1263, 36 L.Ed.2d 129 (1973) (quoting Carpenter v. Shaw, 280 U.S. 363, 367, 50 S.Ct. 121, 122, 74 L.Ed. 478 (1930))).  Paternalistic phrasing aside, it is well established that \"[a] congressional determination to terminate [a reservation] must be expressed on the face of the Act or be clear from the surrounding circumstances and legislative history.\"  Mattz v. Arnett, 412 U.S. 481, 505, 93 S.Ct. 2245, 2258, 37 L.Ed.2d 92 (1973).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The importance of this dispute over whether the Settlement Act terminates the Tribe's ability to increase the territory over which it possesses sovereignty is manifest.  No matter how we hold, the significance of our decision will reach well beyond the confines of the current dispute.  Indeed, in its brief the State points to at least one pending case in which the issue arises.  Nonetheless, we leave this question, which the district court did not address in its lengthy opinion, for another day.  Regardless of whether the issue has in fact been waived, we need not establish in this dispute whether the Settlement Act limits the Tribe's Indian country, as we conclude on independent grounds that the housing site is not a dependent Indian community, and therefore is not Indian country.  Thus we will wait to address the issue on the basis of more developed discussion below;  while it is at heart a question of statutory interpretation, we nonetheless prefer to address the Settlement Act question at a time when the parties, and the court below, have addressed it more fully.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Indian Country</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>1. The Significance of \"Indian Country\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Serving as the backdrop to this case is the doctrine that \"Indian tribes are 'domestic dependent nations' that exercise inherent sovereign authority over their members and territories.\"  Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Citizen Band Potawatomi Indian Tribe, 498 U.S. 505, 509, 111 S.Ct. 905, 909, 112 L.Ed.2d 1112 (1991) (citing Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1, 17, 8 L.Ed. 25 (1831));  see McClanahan, 411 U.S. at 168-69, 93 S.Ct. at 1260-61 (outlining the roots of the Indian sovereignty doctrine).  This rule has softened over time, so that it is no longer true that state law plays no role within a tribe's territory.  Nonetheless, the state's jurisdiction is not automatic.  \"[S]tate laws may be applied to tribal Indians on their reservations if Congress has expressly so provided,\" California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, 480 U.S. 202, 207, 107 S.Ct. 1083, 1087, 94 L.Ed.2d 244 (1987);  where Congress does not so provide, a pre-emption analysis is followed to determine if state law is pre-empted by federal and tribal interests as reflected in federal law.  See id. at 216, 107 S.Ct. at 1091-92;  DeCoteau, 420 U.S. at 427 &amp; n. 2, 95 S.Ct. at 1084-85 &amp; n. 2;  McClanahan, 411 U.S. at 172, 93 S.Ct. at 1262.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, \"it would vastly oversimplify the problem to say that nothing remains of the notion that reservation Indians are a separate people to whom state jurisdiction ... may not extend.\"  McClanahan, 411 U.S. at 170, 93 S.Ct. at 1261.   Therefore, the issue here of whether the housing site is Indian country bears real significance, since \"the Indian country classification is the benchmark for approaching the allocation of federal, tribal, and state authority with respect to Indians and Indian lands.\"  Indian Country, U.S.A. v. Oklahoma Tax Comm'n, 829 F.2d 967, 973 (10th Cir.1987) (collecting cases), cert. denied sub nom.  Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Muscogee (Creek) Nation, 487 U.S. 1218, 108 S.Ct. 2870, 101 L.Ed.2d 906 (1988);  see Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Sac and Fox Nation, 508 U.S. 114, 125, 113 S.Ct. 1985, 1991, 124 L.Ed.2d 30 (1993) (rejecting argument that Indian sovereignty only applies to formal reservation lands, stating \"we ask only whether the land is Indian country\");  Cohen's Handbook of Federal Indian Law 27 (1982 ed.)  (\"[F]or most jurisdictional purposes the governing legal term is 'Indian country.' \").  If the housing site is not Indian country, there is no bar to the exercise of the State's jurisdiction.  If it is, the State presumptively lacks jurisdiction to enforce the regulations and ordinances discussed here, and we must carry out a pre-emption analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2.

Native Village of Venetie Tribal Gov't, 1995 WL 462232, * 1-* 5 (D.Alaska Aug. 2, 1995) (detailing the history of the concept of Indian country).  Here, as the housing site is neither part of a formal reservation nor an allotment, the present dispute is over whether it constitutes a \"dependent Indian community\" for purposes of subsection (b) of section 1151, a dispute we discuss at length below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before addressing that issue, however, we recognize that, as the State notes, section 1151 on its face is concerned only with criminal jurisdiction.  Nonetheless, the Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that the definition provided in section 1151 \"applies to questions of both criminal and civil jurisdiction.\"  Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, 480 U.S. at 208, 107 S.Ct. at 1088;  see also DeCoteau, 420 U.S. at 427, 95 S.Ct. at 1084-85.   Elsewhere, the Court has simply defined \"Indian country\" in civil cases in terms closely paralleling those of section 1151, while citing to that statute.  See Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Chickasaw Nation, 510 U.S. 994, ----, 115 S.Ct. 2214, 2217 n. 2, 132 L.Ed.2d 400 (1995);  Sac and Fox, 508 U.S. at 123, 113 S.Ct. at 1990-91.   Other circuits have followed suit.  See, e.g., Buzzard v. Oklahoma Tax Comm'n, 992 F.2d 1073, 1076 (10th Cir.), cert. denied sub nom.  United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians v. Oklahoma Tax Comm'n, 510 U.S. 994, 114 S.Ct. 555, 126 L.Ed.2d 456 (1993);  Alaska v. Native Village of Venetie, 856 F.2d 1384, 1390 (9th Cir.1988);  Indian Country, U.S.A., 829 F.2d at 973;  see also United States v. South Dakota, 665 F.2d 837, 838 n. 3 (8th Cir.1981) (applying &#167; 1151 in determining whether a housing project was a dependent Indian community), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 823, 103 S.Ct. 52, 74 L.Ed.2d 58 (1982).  It appears manifest that we can, and should, do the same.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The State would have us conclude otherwise.  First, it calls our attention to Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakima Nation v. County of Yakima, 903 F.2d 1207 (9th Cir.1990), aff'd on other grounds, 502 U.S. 251, 112 S.Ct. 683, 116 L.Ed.2d 687 (1992).  In that case, the Ninth Circuit refused to apply section 1151 to the question of whether fee patented land could be taxed by the state.  The court's refusal was based on the reality that, on its terms, section 1151 is a criminal statute, as well as the fact that the taxing power at issue was governed by a noncriminal federal statutory scheme.  Id. at 1215.   The Yakima court made its brief analysis without mentioning any of the Supreme Court cases cited above.  The State looks to Yakima as support for its argument that to transplant section 1151 into the civil context would go against both the plain meaning of the statute and congressional intent.  We reject the State's suggestion that we follow the Ninth Circuit's logic in Yakima, since to the extent that case supports the conclusion that section 1151 only applies in criminal cases,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> it directly contradicts the guidance of the Supreme Court.

See Watchman, 52 F.3d at 1540 n. 10 (rejecting similar arguments).  Aside from the fact that the Court reiterated its reliance on section 1151 for questions of civil jurisdiction as recently as 1995, see Chickasaw Nation, 515 U.S. at ---- n. 2, 115 S.Ct. at 2217 n. 2, we see no reason why the Court should not seize on the definition Congress has offered of what constitutes Indian country in the context of criminal jurisdiction to inform its analysis of Indian country in questions of civil jurisdiction.

Dependent Indian Communities</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With the background set out and our standard of review established, we turn to the central issue of whether the housing site constitutes a \"dependent Indian community.\"   We note that the question of whether land owned by an Indian tribe may fall within a state's civil regulatory jurisdiction appears to be one of first impression in this circuit.  See Narragansett I, 878 F.Supp. at 352.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The inclusion of \"dependent Indian communities\" in the definition of Indian country dates to Supreme Court cases from the early part of this century.  See United States v. Sandoval, 231 U.S. 28, 46, 34 S.Ct. 1, 5, 58 L.Ed. 107 (1913) (\"[L]ong continued legislative and executive usage and an unbroken current of judicial decisions have attributed to the United States as a superior and civilized nation the power and the duty of exercising a fostering care and protection over all dependent Indian communities within its borders ....\");  see also United States v. McGowan, 302 U.S. 535, 538-39, 58 S.Ct. 286, 287-88, 82 L.Ed. 410 (1938).  Exactly what constitutes a \"dependent Indian community,\" however, has not been defined.  Instead, courts addressing the question conduct \"a functional inquiry into the nature of the community,\" weighing a series of factors established by case law.  Levesque, 681 F.2d at 77.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we have not previously faced the precise issue raised here, in United States v. Levesque we addressed whether a region is a dependent Indian community for the purposes of criminal jurisdiction, framing our focus in terms of whether the land is \"both 'Indian' in character and federally dependent.\"   See id. at 77.   In that case, we applied the factors set out by the Tenth Circuit in United States v. Martine, 442 F.2d 1022 (10th Cir.1971), namely:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>the nature of the area in question;  the relationship of the inhabitants of the area to Indian Tribes and the federal government, and the established practice of government agencies toward the area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 1023 (drawing factors from the discussion in Sandoval, 231 U.S. at 45-49, 34 S.Ct. at 5-7).   Other cases determining whether an area constitutes a dependent Indian community, including Tenth Circuit decisions, have relied on additional factors introduced into the case law by the Eighth Circuit in United States v. South Dakota, 665 F.2d 837 (8th Cir.1981).  See, e.g., Watchman, 52 F.3d at 1545 (adopting the South Dakota additions to the Martine list of factors);  Blatchford v. Sullivan, 904 F.2d 542, 547 (10th Cir.1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1035, 111 S.Ct. 699, 112 L.Ed.2d 689 (1991);  United States v. Azure, 801 F.2d 336, 339 (8th Cir.1986);  Housing Auth. of the Seminole Nation v. Harjo, 790 P.2d 1098, 1100 (Okla.1990).  Following their lead, we shall expand upon our discussion in Levesque to incorporate the South Dakota factors.  See Martine, 442 F.2d at 1024 (noting that additional relevant factors may be considered).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, our first factor is \"whether the United States has retained 'title to the lands which it permits the Indians to occupy' and 'authority to enact regulations and protective laws respecting this territory.' \"  South Dakota, 665 F.2d at 839 (quoting Weddell v. Meierhenry, 636 F.2d 211 (8th Cir.1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 941, 101 S.Ct. 2024, 68 L.Ed.2d 329 (1981)).  The second South Dakota factor encompasses the Martine factors, set out above.  Id. Our third consideration is \"whether there is 'an element of cohesiveness ... manifested either by economic pursuits in the area, common interests, or needs of the inhabitants as supplied by that locality.' \"  Id. (quoting Weddell, 636 F.2d at 212-13).   The final South Dakota factor asks \" 'whether such lands have been set apart for the use, occupancy and protection of dependent Indian peoples.' \"  Id. (quoting Weddell, 636 F.2d at 213).   Roughly speaking, the second and third factors weigh whether there is, in fact, an Indian community, and the first and fourth whether it is a dependent one.  We accordingly address them in that order, ultimately concluding that the facts reveal that the housing site is not a dependent Indian community.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Martine Factors</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Martine factors mandate that a court \"weigh the nature of the area in question;  the relationship of the inhabitants of the area to Indian Tribes and the federal government, and the established practice of government agencies toward the area.\"  Martine, 442 F.2d at 1023.   These considerations support the Tribe's contention by demonstrating that the housing site is a community.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, as the district court noted, the BIA has recognized the housing site is in an area \"in which 'a distinct [Indian] community has existed since earliest European contact.' \"  Narragansett I, 878 F.Supp. at 356 (quoting BIA Internal Memorandum on Acknowledgement of Narragansett Indian Tribe, July 1982, at 9).  While we recognize that fact, however, we also note that it cannot be doubted that the Settlement Act extinguishes all claim to aboriginal title to the housing site.  See 25 U.S.C. &#167; 1705(a)(3).  This factor, then, does not weigh in favor of the Tribe.  In contrast, we do not doubt that there will be a significant relationship between the inhabitants of the housing site and the Tribe:  indeed, the entire point of the project is to establish housing for Tribe members and to serve as \"a means of bringing the Narragansetts back together.\"  Narragansett I, 878 F.Supp. at 356.   This weighs in favor of the Tribe.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, some relationship has been established between the federal government, in the form of HUD, IHS, and the BIA, and the housing site.  HUD financed the purchase of the housing site, and recognizes the WHA as an Indian Housing Authority.  It will provide monies for the management of the project and subsidize the occupants' rent, all pursuant to a program \"specifically designed to provide housing for Indians.\"  Narragansett I, 878 F.Supp. at 354;  see South Dakota, 665 F.2d at 840 (remarking upon similar governmental activity as showing \"[f]ederal concern for the [housing] project\").  The district court noted that the fact that there is a relationship between HUD and the community \"is underscored by the evidence that many of the occupants will participate in nutrition, education and job training programs subsidized by the federal government and administered by the Tribe on the adjacent settlement lands.\"  Narragansett I, 878 F.Supp. at 357.   However, we note that, as we find below, while a relationship exists to the extent that these federal entities are active in the housing site, their actions do not rise the level of setting apart the land for the use, occupancy, and protection of dependent Indian peoples.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Cohesiveness</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next weigh whether there is an element of cohesiveness in the community, as demonstrated by economic pursuits, common interests, or the needs of the inhabitants.  See Weddell, 636 F.2d at 211 (noting that these elements are more important than density of population, percentage of Indian residents, or the history and background of the area).  Certainly this factor weighs in favor of finding this a dependent Indian community:  the project will help the Tribe supply housing to its elderly and low-income members.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Further, the housing site is in close proximity to the Tribe's church, the seat of the Tribal Assembly, the offices of the tribal government and the administration of federal programs--in short, it is indeed close to the \"center of tribal government, culture and religious life.\"  Narragansett I, 878 F.Supp. at 356.   Nonetheless, the fact that the housing will be predominantly Indian in character is not enough, by itself, to establish the presence of a dependent Indian community.  See Blatchford, 904 F.2d at 549 (noting that fact that \"Indians constituted the bulk of the population and gave the area a distinctly Indian character does not convert the community into a dependent Indian community\");  Martine, 442 F.2d at 1024 (holding that \"[t]he mere presence of a group of Indians in a particular area\" does not make it a dependent Indian community).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Title and Authority</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to the South Dakota factors which focus on whether the community is in fact a dependent one.  First, we ask whether the United States retains title to the housing site and the authority to enact regulations and laws.  As noted above, the federal government does not in fact hold title;  rather, the housing site is held by the Tribe, who has leased the land to the WHA, in a lease approved by the BIA.  While the Tribe has applied for trust status, as the record stands, that status has not been granted.  The fact that the Tribe, not the government, owns the land does not preclude a finding that the housing site is a dependent Indian community.  See Sandoval, 231 U.S. at 48, 34 S.Ct. at 6-7 (rejecting the argument that Pueblo Indians holding fee simple title to lands precludes the lands from being Indian country);  Martine, 442 F.2d at 1023 (finding that lands purchased by Navajo Tribe from third party, located in an area which is \"a patchwork of land, some of which is owned by the Navajo Tribe, some of which is not\" and which is not within a reservation, was a dependent Indian community);  cf.  Indian Country, U.S.A., 829 F.2d at 975 (noting that patented fee title does not preclude finding territory is a reservation where fee title to the disputed area had passed to the Creek Nation by federal treaty).  Nonetheless, this must weigh against the Tribe.  See Blatchford v. Sullivan, 904 F.2d 542 (10th Cir.1990) (considering, inter alia, fact that private owner held land in determining that land was not dependent Indian community, although it was surrounded by Navajo allotment land);  Weddell, 636 F.2d at 213 (noting, inter alia, that although land was within the exterior boundaries of the original Yankton Sioux Indian Reservation, it was privately held, and finding that the land was not a dependent Indian community for purposes of criminal jurisdiction).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second part of this factor focuses upon the very issue in dispute here:  who has the authority to enact regulations and laws.  The State's authority will be determined by our decision here.  As for the federal government, the record indicates that it has exercised authority in the form of HUD, IHS, and BIA activity, regulations and financing.  Of course, HUD, at least, can provide financing and set regulations in other, non-Indian contexts.  The record does not address whether there is more extensive federal regulation here by HUD than in any other HUD assisted, non-Indian project.  Since this factor is largely determined by our decision today, we find it weighs neither for nor against the Tribe.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Whether the Lands Have Been Set Apart</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The last factor we address is whether the housing site has been set apart by the federal government for the use, occupancy, and protection of dependent Indian peoples.  This proves to be the crucial factor in our discussion.  See Levesque, 681 F.2d at 77 (noting that this is the \"ultimate issue\" in the factual analysis).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>[T]he test for determining whether land is Indian country does not turn upon whether that land is denominated \"trust land\" or \"reservation.\"   Rather, we ask whether the area has been \" 'validly set apart for the use of the Indians as such, under the superintendence of the Government.' \"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Citizen Band Potawatomi Indian Tribe, 498 U.S. at 511, 111 S.Ct. at 910 (quoting United States v.

Indeed, the Tenth Circuit regards this factor as a sufficient measure of whether land is Indian country.  See Buzzard, 992 F.2d at 1076 (noting the existence of &#167; 1151, but applying only the \"set apart for the use of Indians\" test in determining whether land was Indian country).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that the housing site met this factor's criteria.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p>Although the United States does not hold title to the land and did not vest control over it in the Tribe, HUD has, in a manner of speaking, set the land apart for occupancy by elderly and low-income members pursuant to a need recognized both by HUD and the Tribe.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Narragansett I, 878 F.Supp. at 356.   For the reasons discussed below, we disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our first question must be what constitutes setting land apart.  As with the concept of dependent Indian communities, there is no established definition.  Having surveyed the case law, however, we agree with the Tenth Circuit's suggestion that \"land is 'validly set apart for the use of Indians as such' only if the federal government takes some action indicating that the land is designated for use by Indians.\"  Buzzard, 992 F.2d at 1076 (quoting Citizen Band Potawatomi Indian Tribe, 498 U.S. at 511, 111 S.Ct. at 910 (quoting John, 437 U.S. at 649, 98 S.Ct. at 2549)).  In other words, \"[s]uperintendence by the federal government, and the consequential political dependence on the part of the tribe, exists for purposes of section 1151(b) where the degree of congressional and executive control over the tribe is so pervasive as to evidence an intention that the federal government, not the state, be the dominant political institution in the area.\" Native Village of Venetie, 1995 WL 462232, at * 14.   We do not find evidence of such control here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Were the land placed in trust with the United States, this factor would have been met.  Taking land in trust is a considered evaluation and acceptance of responsibility indicative that the federal government has \"set aside\" the lands.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p>[T]rust land is set apart for the use of Indians by the federal government because it can be obtained only by filing a request with the Secretary of the Interior, who must consider, among other things, the Indian's need for the land, and the purposes for which the land will be used.

In addition, before agreeing to acquire trust land, the Secretary must consider several factors including the authority for the transactions, the impact on the state resulting from the removal of the land from the tax rolls, and jurisdictional problems that might arise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Buzzard, 992 F.2d at 1076 (citations omitted).  Additionally, counsel for the Tribe admitted at oral argument that had the land been taken into trust by the United States, the issue of civil and criminal jurisdiction would have been addressed.  The considerations made in the trust process demonstrate that \"when the federal government agrees to hold land in trust, it is prepared to exert jurisdiction over the land.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, we note that in three of the four cases we have found where a court held that a housing project constituted a dependent Indian community, the land was held in trust, with the participation of HUD and an Indian housing authority.  See United States v. Driver, 945 F.2d 1410, 1415 (8th Cir.1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1109, 112 S.Ct. 1209, 117 L.Ed.2d 448 (1992);  South Dakota, 665 F.2d at 839;  U.S. v. Mound, 477 F.Supp. 156, 158 (D.C.S.D.1979)  In the fourth, Housing Authority of the Seminole Nation v. Harjo, Josephine Harjo inherited a restricted Indian allotment from her husband, also a Tribe member.  In 1973 she partitioned four tracts from the larger tract and deeded them to the Seminole Housing Authority, as part of a federally-funded program whereby Harjo would make payments each month and, in seventeen years, would own the house and the land.  Although the United States did not have title to the deeded lands, it continued its \"superintendence\" of the property for the seventeen years of the program, a role evident in the comprehensive federal regulations governing the program.  790 P.2d at 1101.   Thus the court found that the government \"controls virtually every foreseeable legal consideration touching the property until the [program] runs its course or sooner terminates.\"  Id. at 1102.   Although HUD regulations apply in the present case as well, the Tribe has pointed to no such comprehensive superintendence.  Further, although the lands in Harjo were not held in trust, they were not purchased from third parties, as in the present case.  Instead, they were originally part of Harjo's restricted Indian allotment, and the portions of the allotment she did not use remained restricted, a much closer link to government control then the Tribe demonstrates here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, we note that, aside from Harjo, the vast majority of cases we have found which analyze what constitutes a dependent Indian community since &#167; 1151(b) was enacted find there is such a community if the land is held in trust, Driver, 945 F.2d at 1415;  Azure, 801 F.2d at 339;  South Dakota, 665 F.2d at 839;  Mound, 477 F.Supp. at 158;  or as settlement lands, Youngbear v. Brewer, 415 F.Supp. 807, 809 (N.D.Iowa 1976), aff'd, 549 F.2d 74 (8th Cir.1977).  Similarly, in Levesque, we found a dependent Indian community where the land was held by a newly recognized Indian tribe as part of their reservation.  Levesque, 681 F.2d at 78.   On the other hand, we note that in most of the cases we found where land was privately held, even if by a tribe, the courts found there was not a dependent Indian community. See Buzzard, 992 F.2d at 1075 (involving land purchased by tribe);  Blatchford, 904 F.2d at 548 (addressing privately held land surrounded by Navajo allotment land);  Weddell, 636 F.2d at 213 (involving independent municipal corporation on former Indian reservation);  United States v. Oceanside Okla., Inc., 527 F.Supp. 68, 69 (W.D.Okla.1981) (addressing land held in fee by non-Indians);  Native Village of Venetie, 1995 WL 462232, at * 15 (after settlement act extinguished aboriginal claims, fee held by Native Village of Venetie Tribal Government).  But see Martine, 442 F.2d at 1023.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Thus the facts that the housing site is not held in trust or as settlement lands, and that the federal government does not exercise some similar level of control over the land, weigh against the Tribe.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tenth Circuit's analysis in Buzzard v. Oklahoma Tax Commission also weighs against finding the housing site meets the \"set apart\" requirement.  In Buzzard, as here, the Indian tribe unilaterally purchased the lands in dispute, and held title to them in fee simple.  Instead of housing, it set up commercial smokeshops on the land.  The tribe claimed that the land was Indian country because it had been set apart by the federal government for the use of the Indians.  In support of its position, it pointed to a clause in its charter and in 25 U.S.C. &#167; 177 providing that land owned by a tribe cannot be disposed of without the approval of the Secretary of the Interior--a restraint on alienation that the Tribe acknowledges applies here as well.  The Buzzard court rejected the tribe's argument, finding that a restriction on alienation by itself is insufficient to make the land Indian country.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p>If the restriction against alienation were sufficient to make any land purchased by the [tribe] Indian country, the [tribe] could remove land from state jurisdiction and force the federal government to exert jurisdiction over that land without either sovereign having any voice in the matter.  Nothing in McGowan or the cases concerning trust land indicates that the Supreme Court intended for Indian tribes to have such unilateral power to create Indian country.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">992 F.2d at 1076.   Of course, in the present case we have an additional element:  HUD and BIA financial assistance and supervision of a housing project that is more clearly tied to the community's benefit than the smokeshops in Buzzard.   Nonetheless, the court's concern in Buzzard with unilateral creation of Indian country remains a valid one in this case as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, as in Buzzard, we find that the federal role in the WHA project is simply not sufficient to establish that the housing site was \"set apart\" by the federal government.  Our analysis of the facts here, as well as the facts other courts have found determinative in deciding whether land has been \"set apart,\" leads us to conclude that the district court's holding that the housing site had been set apart constituted an abuse of its discretion.  See Planned Parenthood League of Mass. v. Bellotti, 641 F.2d 1006, 1009 (1st Cir.1981) noting that \" 'misapplication of the law to particular facts is an abuse of discretion.' \"  (quoting Charles v. Carey, 627 F.2d 772, 776 (7th Cir.1980)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that without this final factor being in place, we cannot find that the housing site is a dependent Indian community.  See Levesque, 681 F.2d at 77 (stating that \"whether the area was established for the use, occupancy and protection of dependent Indians\" is the \"ultimate issue\" in our fact-based inquiry).  While the first two factors we addressed support the Tribe's contention that the housing site is a community of Indians, the second two demonstrate that it is not a \"dependent\" one.  Without federal ownership of the land, as required in the first South Dakota factor, or federal action sufficient to \"set aside\" the land, as required in the fourth, we cannot find on these facts that the \"dependent\" aspect of the concept of a dependent Indian community has been established.  See United States v. Adair, 913 F.Supp. 1503, 1515 (E.D.Okla.1995) (\"Although the government's retention of title ... or government title in trust for an Indian tribe, does not in and of itself establish an area as a \"dependent\" Indian community ..., without such title, consideration of the other ... factors should be unnecessary.\");  Native Village of Venetie, 1995 WL 462232, at * 13 (noting that the question of whether there is federal superintendence \"brings into play the 'dependent' component\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Put simply, it is too far a stretch to regard the government agency funding and oversight here as evidencing a federal intent to give the tribe presumptive sovereignty over the housing site by making it Indian country.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  It seems implausible that a tribe could obtain a valid claim to Indian country--and thus presumptive sovereignty rights--over theretofore privately-held lands just by purchasing them and obtaining financial and other assistance from the government for their development, without any opportunity for involvement by the state, any negotiated agreements with respect to jurisdiction over the land, or considered analysis by the federal government such as the one described for the placement of lands in trust.  Viewed more reasonably, the federal action here at best evidences an intent to assist in the development of affordable housing for use by Tribe members, without necessarily incurring a commitment to exercise jurisdiction and \"superintendence\" over all activities on that land, whether related to housing or not, to the presumptive exclusion of state laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the above reasons, we hold that the district court's denial of the request for a permanent injunction insofar as it was based on the plaintiffs' failure to comply with the requirements of any State regulations promulgated pursuant to the Historic Preservation Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act and those provisions of the Rhode Island building code and Charlestown Zoning Ordinance is reversed, and the district court shall enter an order granting the injunction.  The district court's grant of the request for a permanent injunction of plaintiffs from occupying or permitting occupation of any buildings constructed or to be constructed on the housing site unless and until all applicable requirements of Rhode Island's Coastal Resources Management Program have been satisfied and from interfering with the drainage easement previously conveyed to the Town of Charlestown is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Third Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> This suit was initially brought by plaintiffs against the Narragansett Electric Company, a Rhode Island public utility corporation.

The State subsequently intervened in the lawsuit and filed a counterclaim for declaratory and injunctive relief against the plaintiffs, and it is the State's counterclaim that underlies this appeal.  The Narragansett Electric Company takes no position with respect to the issues raised by the State in this appeal.  We add that, because the plaintiffs have asserted no claims against the State, this action does not implicate Eleventh Amendment concerns, and the Supreme Court's decision in Seminole Tribe of Florida v.

That section is cited only twice in the Court's decision.  It first appears, without real comment, in the majority's summation of the Yakima Nation's argument that section 6 of the Indian General Allotment Act of 1887 is a dead letter.  502 U.S. at 260, 112 S.Ct. at 689 (citing the 1948 passage of section 1151 with its definition of Indian country as impliedly repealing section 6's jurisdictional grant).  Next, in his separate opinion, Justice Blackmun notes that the majority conceded that section 6 can no longer be read as providing plenary jurisdiction over Indians who reside on reservation fee lands.  502 U.S. at 271, 112 S.Ct. at 694-95 (Blackmun, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  In support of that position, he cites to DeCoteau, 420 U.S. at 428 n. 2, 95 S.Ct. at 1085 n. 2, for the premise that the section 1151 definition \"demarcates [the] general boundary of civil jurisdiction of States.\"  Id</p>\n        <p>Since the Supreme Court's opinion in Yakima gives no indication that the Court either agrees with the Ninth Circuit's discussion of section 1151 or is calling its own prior statements into doubt, and since it has subsequently reaffirmed that the definition carries into an analysis of civil jurisdiction, see Chickasaw Nation, 515 U.S. at ---- n. 2, 115 S.Ct. at 2217 n. 2, we will continue to follow the Court's guidance on the application of section 1151.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The fact that occupancy is actually open to anyone, pursuant to HUD regulations, does not bar finding this a dependent Indian community.

See id. at 354 (detailing history of purchase of the housing site).  The housing site is adjacent to the Tribe's other lands, separated from them by a town road.  The Tribe's church, the long house which serves as the seat of the Tribal Assembly, and the offices where the tribal government meets and programs for tribal members are administered are all established in close proximity to the housing site;  a proposed tribal community center and tribal health center are to be constructed on the settlement lands as well.  The approximately 32 acres of the housing site is located within the coastal zone designated in the State's Coastal Resources Management Program (\"CRMP\").  Also, the section of the Town in which the housing site is located is zoned to require at least two acres of land per residential unit, a requirement the proposed project does not meet, as it will have some fifty units.  As the district court noted, although occupancy is open to anyone \"it is contemplated that most, if not all of the units, will be occupied by elderly and low-income members of the Tribe.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") has recognized the WHA as an Indian Housing Authority, and has provided the financing for the purchase of the housing site and the construction of the buildings.  HUD will also provide money both for managing the project and for subsidizing the occupants' rent.  The HUD funds have been made pursuant to a program designed to provide housing for Indians.  See The Indian Housing Act of 1988, 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1437aa-1437ff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The WHA bought the land, and then conveyed it to the Tribe.  A deed restriction requires that the land be placed in trust with the federal government, for the express purpose of providing housing for tribal members.  The district court found that the Tribe had applied for trust status, but that the application had not yet been granted.  Meanwhile, the land has been leased to the WHA, with the approval of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (\"BIA\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The WHA began construction on the housing site without a building permit from the Town or state approval of the individual sewage disposal systems (the \"ISDS\") serving the project.  Nor did the WHA \"obtain any determination that the project is consistent with Rhode Island's CRMP or state regulations designed to preserve property of historical or archeological significance.\"  Narragansett I, 878 F.Supp. at 354.   The district court found that the excavation for the project has infringed on the Town's drainage easement, and has threatened to alter drainage patterns to the detriment of coastal and groundwater resources.  At the same time, however, the ISDS systems meet Indian Health Service (\"IHS\") regulations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  \"[T]he record is silent regarding the differences, if any, between the State's building code and the Tribe's building code or what the significance of any such differences may be.\"  Id. at 355.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To further complicate the picture, \"[t]he evidence demonstrates that the housing site is in close proximity to Ninigret Pond, a fragile salt water estuary that is a prime spawning ground for several species of commercially important fish.\"  Id.

Noting that \"tribal sovereignty is no longer an absolute bar to the assertion of state authority in Indian country,\" Narragansett I, 878 F.Supp. at 359, the court carried out a pre-emption analysis.  It concluded that the State's building and zoning regulations were pre-empted, as was its jurisdiction to regulate the ISDS systems.  However, it found that Rhode Island's CRMP was not pre-empted, and accordingly enjoined the WHA and the Tribe from occupying buildings on the housing site unless that program's requirements were satisfied.

The ground for its claims was that the lands had been unlawfully alienated in violation of the Indian Nonintercourse Act, 25 U.S.C. &#167; 177.  See Southern R.I. Land Dev.  Corp., 418 F.Supp. at 802-03 (recounting history of dispute).  The parties to the dispute settled the claims in 1978 by entering into a Joint Memorandum of Understanding.  The Tribe relinquished its title claims, and in return received a sum of money<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and effective control over some 1,800 acres of land, whose title was held by a corporation (the \"settlement lands\").  Implementing legislation was passed by the United States Congress in the form of the Settlement Act, and by the Rhode Island legislature as well, see Narragansett Indian Land Management Corporation Act, 6A R.I. Gen. Laws &#167;&#167; 37-18-1 to 37-18-15 (1990).  See generally Town of Charlestown, 696 F.Supp. at 801-05 (detailing the history and provisions of the Settlement Act).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1983, the Narragansetts were officially recognized as an Indian tribe.  See Narragansett Indian Tribe, 19 F.3d at 689.   In 1988, the Tribe deeded the settlement lands to the BIA, to be held in trust.  Id. This court has held that although the Settlement Act allows State civil and criminal jurisdiction over the settlement lands, with some exceptions, the Tribe nonetheless has \"concurrent jurisdiction over, and exercise[s] governmental power with respect to, those lands.\"  Id. (holding that the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2701-2721, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1166-1168, applies to the settlement lands).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. The Present Dispute</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The State's first contention in the present case is that the Settlement Act precludes a finding that the housing site, which is not part of the settlement lands, is Indian country, because that Act resolved the Tribe's land claims and established the boundaries of the Tribe's Indian country in Rhode Island.  It maintains that we should interpret section 1705(a)(3) of the Settlement Act as extinguishing all of the Tribe's claims and limiting the boundaries of its Indian country.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  The linchpin of its argument is its contention that it was Congress' intent in the Settlement Act to set definite limits to the Tribe's Indian country and to extinguish any claim to greater boundaries, and congressional intent must prevail.

No matter how we hold, the significance of our decision will reach well beyond the confines of the current dispute.  Indeed, in its brief the State points to at least one pending case in which the issue arises.  Nonetheless, we leave this question, which the district court did not address in its lengthy opinion, for another day.  Regardless of whether the issue has in fact been waived, we need not establish in this dispute whether the Settlement Act limits the Tribe's Indian country, as we conclude on independent grounds that the housing site is not a dependent Indian community, and therefore is not Indian country.  Thus we will wait to address the issue on the basis of more developed discussion below;  while it is at heart a question of statutory interpretation, we nonetheless prefer to address the Settlement Act question at a time when the parties, and the court below, have addressed it more fully.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.

In that case, the Ninth Circuit refused to apply section 1151 to the question of whether fee patented land could be taxed by the state.

See Watchman, 52 F.3d at 1540 n. 10 (rejecting similar arguments).

Following their lead, we shall expand upon our discussion in Levesque to incorporate the South Dakota factors.  See Martine, 442 F.2d at 1024 (noting that additional relevant factors may be considered).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, our first factor is \"whether the United States has retained 'title to the lands which it permits the Indians to occupy' and 'authority to enact regulations and protective laws respecting this territory.' \"  South Dakota, 665 F.2d at 839 (quoting Weddell v. Meierhenry, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"384813\"><a href=\"/opinion/384813/james-russell-weddell-v-mark-meierhenry-attorney-general-of-the-state-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">636</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">211</span></a></span> (8th Cir.1980), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">941</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">329</span></span> (1981)).  The second South Dakota factor encompasses the Martine factors, set out above.  Id. Our third consideration is \"whether there is 'an element of cohesiveness ... manifested either by economic pursuits in the area, common interests, or needs of the inhabitants as supplied by that locality.' \"  Id. (quoting Weddell, 636 F.2d at 212-13).   The final South Dakota factor asks \" 'whether such lands have been set apart for the use, occupancy and protection of dependent Indian peoples.' \"  Id. (quoting Weddell, 636 F.2d at 213).   Roughly speaking, the second and third factors weigh whether there is, in fact, an Indian community, and the first and fourth whether it is a dependent one.  We accordingly address them in that order, ultimately concluding that the facts reveal that the housing site is not a dependent Indian community.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Martine Factors</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Martine factors mandate that a court \"weigh the nature of the area in question;  the relationship of the inhabitants of the area to Indian Tribes and the federal government, and the established practice of government agencies toward the area.\"  Martine, 442 F.2d at 1023.   These considerations support the Tribe's contention by demonstrating that the housing site is a community.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, as the district court noted, the BIA has recognized the housing site is in an area \"in which 'a distinct [Indian] community has existed since earliest European contact.' \"  Narragansett I, 878 F.Supp. at 356 (quoting BIA Internal Memorandum on Acknowledgement of Narragansett Indian Tribe, July 1982, at 9).  While we recognize that fact, however, we also note that it cannot be doubted that the Settlement Act extinguishes all claim to aboriginal title to the housing site.  See 25 U.S.C. &#167; 1705(a)(3).  This factor, then, does not weigh in favor of the Tribe.  In contrast, we do not doubt that there will be a significant relationship between the inhabitants of the housing site and the Tribe:  indeed, the entire point of the project is to establish housing for Tribe members and to serve as \"a means of bringing the Narragansetts back together.\"  Narragansett I, 878 F.Supp. at 356.   This weighs in favor of the Tribe.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, some relationship has been established between the federal government, in the form of HUD, IHS, and the BIA, and the housing site.  HUD financed the purchase of the housing site, and recognizes the WHA as an Indian Housing Authority.  It will provide monies for the management of the project and subsidize the occupants' rent, all pursuant to a program \"specifically designed to provide housing for Indians.\"  Narragansett I, 878 F.Supp. at 354;  see South Dakota, 665 F.2d at 840 (remarking upon similar governmental activity as showing \"[f]ederal concern for the [housing] project\").  The district court noted that the fact that there is a relationship between HUD and the community \"is underscored by the evidence that many of the occupants will participate in nutrition, education and job training programs subsidized by the federal government and administered by the Tribe on the adjacent settlement lands.\"  Narragansett I, 878 F.Supp. at 357.   However, we note that, as we find below, while a relationship exists to the extent that these federal entities are active in the housing site, their actions do not rise the level of setting apart the land for the use, occupancy, and protection of dependent Indian peoples.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Cohesiveness</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next weigh whether there is an element of cohesiveness in the community, as demonstrated by economic pursuits, common interests, or the needs of the inhabitants.  See Weddell, 636 F.2d at 211 (noting that these elements are more important than density of population, percentage of Indian residents, or the history and background of the area).  Certainly this factor weighs in favor of finding this a dependent Indian community:  the project will help the Tribe supply housing to its elderly and low-income members.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Further, the housing site is in close proximity to the Tribe's church, the seat of the Tribal Assembly, the offices of the tribal government and the administration of federal programs--in short, it is indeed close to the \"center of tribal government, culture and religious life.\"  Narragansett I, 878 F.Supp. at 356.   Nonetheless, the fact that the housing will be predominantly Indian in character is not enough, by itself, to establish the presence of a dependent Indian community.  See Blatchford, 904 F.2d at 549 (noting that fact that \"Indians constituted the bulk of the population and gave the area a distinctly Indian character does not convert the community into a dependent Indian community\");  Martine, 442 F.2d at 1024 (holding that \"[t]he mere presence of a group of Indians in a particular area\" does not make it a dependent Indian community).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Title and Authority</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to the South Dakota factors which focus on whether the community is in fact a dependent one.  First, we ask whether the United States retains title to the housing site and the authority to enact regulations and laws.  As noted above, the federal government does not in fact hold title;  rather, the housing site is held by the Tribe, who has leased the land to the WHA, in a lease approved by the BIA.  While the Tribe has applied for trust status, as the record stands, that status has not been granted.  The fact that the Tribe, not the government, owns the land does not preclude a finding that the housing site is a dependent Indian community.  See Sandoval, 231 U.S. at 48, 34 S.Ct. at 6-7 (rejecting the argument that Pueblo Indians holding fee simple title to lands precludes the lands from being Indian country);  Martine, 442 F.2d at 1023 (finding that lands purchased by Navajo Tribe from third party, located in an area which is \"a patchwork of land, some of which is owned by the Navajo Tribe, some of which is not\" and which is not within a reservation, was a dependent Indian community);  cf.  Indian Country, U.S.A., 829 F.2d at 975 (noting that patented fee title does not preclude finding territory is a reservation where fee title to the disputed area had passed to the Creek Nation by federal treaty).  Nonetheless, this must weigh against the Tribe.  See Blatchford v. Sullivan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"542386\"><a href=\"/opinion/542386/herbert-charles-blatchford-jr-v-george-sullivan-warden-and-attorney/\"><span class=\"volume\">904</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">542</span></a></span> (10th Cir.1990) (considering, inter alia, fact that private owner held land in determining that land was not dependent Indian community, although it was surrounded by Navajo allotment land);  Weddell, 636 F.2d at 213 (noting, inter alia, that although land was within the exterior boundaries of the original Yankton Sioux Indian Reservation, it was privately held, and finding that the land was not a dependent Indian community for purposes of criminal jurisdiction).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second part of this factor focuses upon the very issue in dispute here:  who has the authority to enact regulations and laws.  The State's authority will be determined by our decision here.  As for the federal government, the record indicates that it has exercised authority in the form of HUD, IHS, and BIA activity, regulations and financing.  Of course, HUD, at least, can provide financing and set regulations in other, non-Indian contexts.  The record does not address whether there is more extensive federal regulation here by HUD than in any other HUD assisted, non-Indian project.  Since this factor is largely determined by our decision today, we find it weighs neither for nor against the Tribe.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Whether the Lands Have Been Set Apart</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The last factor we address is whether the housing site has been set apart by the federal government for the use, occupancy, and protection of dependent Indian peoples.  This proves to be the crucial factor in our discussion.  See Levesque, 681 F.2d at 77 (noting that this is the \"ultimate issue\" in the factual analysis).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>[T]he test for determining whether land is Indian country does not turn upon whether that land is denominated \"trust land\" or \"reservation.\"   Rather, we ask whether the area has been \" 'validly set apart for the use of the Indians as such, under the superintendence of the Government.' \"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Citizen Band Potawatomi Indian Tribe, 498 U.S. at 511, 111 S.Ct. at 910 (quoting United States v.

Indeed, the Tenth Circuit regards this factor as a sufficient measure of whether land is Indian country.  See Buzzard, 992 F.2d at 1076 (noting the existence of &#167; 1151, but applying only the \"set apart for the use of Indians\" test in determining whether land was Indian country).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that the housing site met this factor's criteria.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p>Although the United States does not hold title to the land and did not vest control over it in the Tribe, HUD has, in a manner of speaking, set the land apart for occupancy by elderly and low-income members pursuant to a need recognized both by HUD and the Tribe.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Narragansett I, 878 F.Supp. at 356.

As with the concept of dependent Indian communities, there is no established definition.  Having surveyed the case law, however, we agree with the Tenth Circuit's suggestion that \"land is 'validly set apart for the use of Indians as such' only if the federal government takes some action indicating that the land is designated for use by Indians.\"  Buzzard, 992 F.2d at 1076 (quoting Citizen Band Potawatomi Indian Tribe, 498 U.S. at 511, 111 S.Ct. at 910 (quoting John, 437 U.S. at 649, 98 S.Ct. at 2549)).  In other words, \"[s]uperintendence by the federal government, and the consequential political dependence on the part of the tribe, exists for purposes of section 1151(b) where the degree of congressional and executive control over the tribe is so pervasive as to evidence an intention that the federal government, not the state, be the dominant political institution in the area.\" Native Village of Venetie, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">462232</span></span>, at * 14.

Harjo, Josephine Harjo inherited a restricted Indian allotment from her husband, also a Tribe member.  In 1973 she partitioned four tracts from the larger tract and deeded them to the Seminole Housing Authority, as part of a federally-funded program whereby Harjo would make payments each month and, in seventeen years, would own the house and the land.  Although the United States did not have title to the deeded lands, it continued its \"superintendence\" of the property for the seventeen years of the program, a role evident in the comprehensive federal regulations governing the program.  790 P.2d at 1101.   Thus the court found that the government \"controls virtually every foreseeable legal consideration touching the property until the [program] runs its course or sooner terminates.\"  Id. at 1102.   Although HUD regulations apply in the present case as well, the Tribe has pointed to no such comprehensive superintendence.  Further, although the lands in Harjo were not held in trust, they were not purchased from third parties, as in the present case.  Instead, they were originally part of Harjo's restricted Indian allotment, and the portions of the allotment she did not use remained restricted, a much closer link to government control then the Tribe demonstrates here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, we note that, aside from Harjo, the vast majority of cases we have found which analyze what constitutes a dependent Indian community since &#167; 1151(b) was enacted find there is such a community if the land is held in trust, Driver, 945 F.2d at 1415;  Azure, 801 F.2d at 339;  South Dakota, 665 F.2d at 839;  Mound, 477 F.Supp. at 158;  or as settlement lands, Youngbear v.

Similarly, in Levesque, we found a dependent Indian community where the land was held by a newly recognized Indian tribe as part of their reservation.  Levesque, 681 F.2d at 78.   On the other hand, we note that in most of the cases we found where land was privately held, even if by a tribe, the courts found there was not a dependent Indian community. See Buzzard, 992 F.2d at 1075 (involving land purchased by tribe);  Blatchford, 904 F.2d at 548 (addressing privately held land surrounded by Navajo allotment land);  Weddell, 636 F.2d at 213 (involving independent municipal corporation on former Indian reservation);  United States v. Oceanside Okla., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2368422\"><a href=\"/opinion/2368422/united-states-v-oceanside-oklahoma-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span>, 69 (W.D.Okla.1981) (addressing land held in fee by non-Indians);  Native Village of Venetie, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">462232</span></span>, at * 15 (after settlement act extinguished aboriginal claims, fee held by Native Village of Venetie Tribal Government).  But see Martine, 442 F.2d at 1023.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Thus the facts that the housing site is not held in trust or as settlement lands, and that the federal government does not exercise some similar level of control over the land, weigh against the Tribe.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tenth Circuit's analysis in Buzzard v. Oklahoma Tax Commission also weighs against finding the housing site meets the \"set apart\" requirement.  In Buzzard, as here, the Indian tribe unilaterally purchased the lands in dispute, and held title to them in fee simple.  Instead of housing, it set up commercial smokeshops on the land.  The tribe claimed that the land was Indian country because it had been set apart by the federal government for the use of the Indians.  In support of its position, it pointed to a clause in its charter and in 25 U.S.C. &#167; 177 providing that land owned by a tribe cannot be disposed of without the approval of the Secretary of the Interior--a restraint on alienation that the Tribe acknowledges applies here as well.  The Buzzard court rejected the tribe's argument, finding that a restriction on alienation by itself is insufficient to make the land Indian country.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p>If the restriction against alienation were sufficient to make any land purchased by the [tribe] Indian country, the [tribe] could remove land from state jurisdiction and force the federal government to exert jurisdiction over that land without either sovereign having any voice in the matter.  Nothing in McGowan or the cases concerning trust land indicates that the Supreme Court intended for Indian tribes to have such unilateral power to create Indian country.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">992 F.2d at 1076.   Of course, in the present case we have an additional element:  HUD and BIA financial assistance and supervision of a housing project that is more clearly tied to the community's benefit than the smokeshops in Buzzard.   Nonetheless, the court's concern in Buzzard with unilateral creation of Indian country remains a valid one in this case as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, as in Buzzard, we find that the federal role in the WHA project is simply not sufficient to establish that the housing site was \"set apart\" by the federal government.  Our analysis of the facts here, as well as the facts other courts have found determinative in deciding whether land has been \"set apart,\" leads us to conclude that the district court's holding that the housing site had been set apart constituted an abuse of its discretion.  See Planned Parenthood League of Mass. v. Bellotti, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"387368\"><a href=\"/opinion/387368/planned-parenthood-league-of-massachusetts-v-francis-x-bellotti/\"><span class=\"volume\">641</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1006</span></a></span>, 1009 (1st Cir.1981) noting that \" 'misapplication of the law to particular facts is an abuse of discretion.' \"  (quoting Charles v. Carey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"380984\"><a href=\"/opinion/380984/allen-g-charles-md-v-bernard-carey-the-hope-clinic-for-women-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">627</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">772</span></a></span>, 776 (7th Cir.1980)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that without this final factor being in place, we cannot find that the housing site is a dependent Indian community.  See Levesque, 681 F.2d at 77 (stating that \"whether the area was established for the use, occupancy and protection of dependent Indians\" is the \"ultimate issue\" in our fact-based inquiry).  While the first two factors we addressed support the Tribe's contention that the housing site is a community of Indians, the second two demonstrate that it is not a \"dependent\" one.  Without federal ownership of the land, as required in the first South Dakota factor, or federal action sufficient to \"set aside\" the land, as required in the fourth, we cannot find on these facts that the \"dependent\" aspect of the concept of a dependent Indian community has been established.  See United States v. Adair, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">913</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1503</span></span>, 1515 (E.D.Okla.1995) (\"Although the government's retention of title ... or government title in trust for an Indian tribe, does not in and of itself establish an area as a \"dependent\" Indian community ..., without such title, consideration of the other ... factors should be unnecessary.\");  Native Village of Venetie, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">462232</span></span>, at * 13 (noting that the question of whether there is federal superintendence \"brings into play the 'dependent' component\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Put simply, it is too far a stretch to regard the government agency funding and oversight here as evidencing a federal intent to give the tribe presumptive sovereignty over the housing site by making it Indian country.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  It seems implausible that a tribe could obtain a valid claim to Indian country--and thus presumptive sovereignty rights--over theretofore privately-held lands just by purchasing them and obtaining financial and other assistance from the government for their development, without any opportunity for involvement by the state, any negotiated agreements with respect to jurisdiction over the land, or considered analysis by the federal government such as the one described for the placement of lands in trust.  Viewed more reasonably, the federal action here at best evidences an intent to assist in the development of affordable housing for use by Tribe members, without necessarily incurring a commitment to exercise jurisdiction and \"superintendence\" over all activities on that land, whether related to housing or not, to the presumptive exclusion of state laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the above reasons, we hold that the district court's denial of the request for a permanent injunction insofar as it was based on the plaintiffs' failure to comply with the requirements of any State regulations promulgated pursuant to the Historic Preservation Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act and those provisions of the Rhode Island building code and Charlestown Zoning Ordinance is reversed, and the district court shall enter an order granting the injunction.  The district court's grant of the request for a permanent injunction of plaintiffs from occupying or permitting occupation of any buildings constructed or to be constructed on the housing site unless and until all applicable requirements of Rhode Island's Coastal Resources Management Program have been satisfied and from interfering with the drainage easement previously conveyed to the Town of Charlestown is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Third Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> This suit was initially brought by plaintiffs against the Narragansett Electric Company, a Rhode Island public utility corporation.

The State subsequently intervened in the lawsuit and filed a counterclaim for declaratory and injunctive relief against the plaintiffs, and it is the State's counterclaim that underlies this appeal.  The Narragansett Electric Company takes no position with respect to the issues raised by the State in this appeal.  We add that, because the plaintiffs have asserted no claims against the State, this action does not implicate Eleventh Amendment concerns, and the Supreme Court's decision in Seminole Tribe of Florida v.

That section is cited only twice in the Court's decision.  It first appears, without real comment, in the majority's summation of the Yakima Nation's argument that section 6 of the Indian General Allotment Act of 1887 is a dead letter.  502 U.S. at 260, 112 S.Ct. at 689 (citing the 1948 passage of section 1151 with its definition of Indian country as impliedly repealing section 6's jurisdictional grant).  Next, in his separate opinion, Justice Blackmun notes that the majority conceded that section 6 can no longer be read as providing plenary jurisdiction over Indians who reside on reservation fee lands.  502 U.S. at 271, 112 S.Ct. at 694-95 (Blackmun, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  In support of that position, he cites to DeCoteau, 420 U.S. at 428 n. 2, 95 S.Ct. at 1085 n. 2, for the premise that the section 1151 definition \"demarcates [the] general boundary of civil jurisdiction of States.\"  Id</p>\n        <p>Since the Supreme Court's opinion in Yakima gives no indication that the Court either agrees with the Ninth Circuit's discussion of section 1151 or is calling its own prior statements into doubt, and since it has subsequently reaffirmed that the definition carries into an analysis of civil jurisdiction, see Chickasaw Nation, 515 U.S. at ---- n. 2, 115 S.Ct. at 2217 n. 2, we will continue to follow the Court's guidance on the application of section 1151.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The fact that occupancy is actually open to anyone, pursuant to HUD regulations, does not bar finding this a dependent Indian community.  See South Dakota, 665 F.2d at 842 (\"The fact that a small number of non-Indians reside at the project does not defeat a finding of a dependent Indian community.\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> We note that in its brief discussion in Martine, the Tenth Circuit did not consider whether the lands had been \"set apart.\"  442 F.2d at 1023-24.   Later decisions in that circuit, however, have incorporated the South Dakota factors in their analysis.  See Watchman, 52 F.3d at 1545 (adopting the South Dakota additions to the Martine list of factors);  see also Blatchford, 904 F.2d at 544-49 (discussing development of the case law and conducting factual analysis).  Indeed, in Buzzard, the court relied solely on the \"validly set apart\" definition of Indian country, eschewing analysis under section 1151.
