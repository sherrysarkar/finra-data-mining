Ronald Russo (\"Russo\")\r\nbrought this diversity-of-citizenship action against Baxter\r\nHealthcare Corporation (\"Baxter\"), claiming that Baxter had\r\nviolated his rights under the Rhode Island Uniform Trade Secrets\r\nAct, had interfered with his prospective business relationships and\r\nhad negligently injured him by rendering his invention unpatentable\r\nin foreign countries.  When the case went to trial, Baxter\r\nexercised its right under Fed. R. Civ. P. (\"Rule\") 50(a) to move\r\nfor judgment as a matter of law when Russo had completed his proofs\r\nand rested.  That motion was granted, and the action was dismissed. \r\nRusso appeals, and we affirm the district court's final judgment in\r\nBaxter's favor.\r\n                   Standard of Review\r\n     We review the grant of a Rule 50(a) motion for judgment\r\nas a matter of law de novo, using the same standards as the\r\ndistrict court (Andrade v. Jamestown Hous. Auth., 82 F.3d 1179,\r\n1186 (1st Cir. 1996)).  All of the evidence and inferences drawn\r\nfrom the evidence are therefore considered in the light most\r\nfavorable to nonmovant Russo, and we hereafter apply that principle\r\nin the Facts section.\r\n     As for the legal standard to be applied to the facts as\r\nso considered, Andrade, id. (quoting Murray v. Ross-Dove Co., 5\r\nF.3d 573, 576 (1st Cir. 1993), and using the older Rule 50(a) term\r\n\"directed verdict\") teaches:\r\n     A verdict may be directed only if the\r\n     evidence, viewed from this perspective, \"would\r\n     not permit a reasonable jury to find in favor\r\n     of the plaintiff[] on any permissible claim or\r\n     theory.\"\r\n\nBut the plaintiff must provide \"more than a mere scintilla' of\r\nevidence and may not rely on conjecture or speculation\" to justify\r\nthe submission of an issue to the jury (Katz v. City Metal Co., 87\r\nF.3d 26, 28 (1st Cir. 1996)).\r\n                         Facts\r\n     In 1983 Russo began working with a company then called\r\nSuperior Plastics Products Corp. and later known as Superior\r\nHealthcare Corporation (\"Superior\") under an agreement calling for\r\nhim to develop new medical products in return for royalties based\r\nupon the success of his inventions.  In 1989 Russo developed a new\r\nkind of closed-seal tracheal suction catheter, a device that uses\r\nan endotracheal tube to clear the airways of patients breathing on\r\na mechanical ventilator.  Russo's catheter had unique features,\r\nsuch as a rear irrigation port and a clamp valve, that\r\ndistinguished it from others on the market. \r\n     Russo disclosed his idea for the improved catheter to\r\nSuperior's President David Brodsky (\"Brodsky\").  Because Brodsky\r\nconsidered that Superior lacked the ability to market such a\r\nproduct, he sought another company to fill that role.  To that end,\r\nin April 1990 Brodsky and Baxter discussed an agreement under which\r\nBaxter would manufacture and distribute the device.  As part of\r\nits evaluation of the product, Baxter sent prototypes of the\r\ncatheter to two clinicians so they could conduct bench trials. \r\nBaxter did not require that either clinician sign a confidentiality\r\nagreement before doing so.\r\nIn May Brodsky told Russo about his discussions with\r\nBaxter (but not about the bench trials).  Russo asked that Baxter\r\nbe required to sign a confidentiality agreement, and Brodsky orally\r\nagreed to obtain one. Later in May Russo stopped working with\r\nSuperior because of a dispute over money and issues unrelated to\r\nthis action.  Nonetheless, Russo retained some access to Superior's\r\noffices and observed that Superior continued to develop his\r\ncatheter.  He also learned that in June Baxter and Superior had\r\nentered into an Exclusive Distribution Agreement (\"Agreement\") that\r\ngranted Baxter an option to obtain rights in the catheter.\r\nRusso acted promptly in response to that discovery,\r\nsending two letters to Baxter asserting that he held the rights to\r\nthe catheter.  On June 14 he also filed an application with the\r\nUnited States Patent and Trademark Office (\"PTO\") for a patent on\r\nthe catheter, and on June 25 he sued Superior and Baxter in Rhode\r\nIsland Superior Court, seeking an injunction to prevent both\r\ncompanies from implementing the Agreement.  Baxter and Superior\r\npromptly countered in July by submitting their own application to\r\nthe PTO for a United States patent on the catheter.  In addition\r\nBaxter, without Russo's knowledge, conducted additional field\r\ntrials on the catheter from June to August.  As part of those field\r\ntrials, Baxter sent out samples of the device to 14 hospitals\r\naround the United States to solicit practitioner comments.  Again\r\nBaxter did not require that the participants in its field trials\r\nagree to keep the catheter confidential.\r\nOver a year later, in late October 1991, Russo's patent\r\nattorney Robert Doherty (\"Doherty\") received a Notice of Allowance\r\nfrom the PTO informing him that Russo's United States patent\r\napplication had been approved.  Doherty paid the mandatory issuance\r\nfee and expected that the PTO would issue the patent within two or\r\nthree months.  In November 1991 Russo discussed filing patent\r\napplications in foreign countries with Doherty.  They agreed on a\r\ntentative list of target countries, and Doherty sought out a\r\nconsultant in foreign patent law because he lacked sufficient\r\ncontacts and knowledge to file patents in most foreign countries.\r\nOn December 9, 1991 Baxter displayed Russo's closed\r\nsuction tracheal catheter at the American Association of\r\nRespiratory Care convention in Atlanta.  Baxter demonstrated the\r\ncatheter, incorporated it into a sales brochure and took some sales\r\nleads on it.  Russo did not authorize any of those activities, and\r\nhe did not discover what Baxter had done until several days after\r\nthe convention. \r\nRusso immediately told Doherty about Baxter's\r\nunauthorized disclosure of his product at the convention (at that\r\npoint Russo did not know about the earlier bench trials and field\r\ntests).  Without performing any research or consulting with his\r\nforeign patent expert, Doherty advised Russo that Baxter's\r\ndisclosures at the convention had destroyed the novelty of his\r\ninvention and thus made it unpatentable in any foreign country\r\nother than Canada or possibly Australia.  Doherty told Russo that\r\nno foreign patent applications should even be filed, because he\r\nbelieved that no patents could issue after Baxter's publication at\r\nthe Atlanta convention--or alternatively, that any patents that\r\nmight issue would be invalid and worthless.\r\nDoherty's legal advice was dead wrong.  Under the\r\nEuropean Patent Convention and the law of most industrialized\r\ncountries, an unauthorized disclosure of an invention does not\r\nimmediately destroy its novelty (and thus foreclose the inventor's\r\nability to patent the invention).  Instead, such an adverse\r\ndisclosure bars only patent applications made more than six months\r\nafter the date of the disclosure (Art. 55 of the Convention on the\r\nGrant of European Patents, as printed in European Patent Convention(4th ed., Munich:  European Patent Office, 1987)).  That being so,\r\nDoherty should instead have advised Russo that he could still apply\r\nfor foreign patents, because Baxter's actions at the Atlanta\r\nconvention would not by themselves have affected Russo's ability to\r\nobtain such patents if applied for during the six-month window\r\nperiod after December 9, 1991.\r\nWhat is critical to this litigation is that Russo relied\r\nupon Doherty's flawed advice and decided not to seek patents\r\nabroad.  As a consequence, Doherty did nothing more to prepare any\r\nforeign patent applications.  \r\nOn January 28, 1992 the PTO issued a patent to Russo on\r\nhis catheter.  That unquestionably barred Russo from obtaining any\r\nforeign patents because that publication of the catheter--made\r\nunder the auspices of Russo himself, rather than by some\r\nunauthorized third party--made it a part of the \"state of the art,\"\r\nso that it was not a \"new\" invention for foreign patent purposes.\r\nThat destroyed the invention's eligibility for such patents\r\n(European Patent Convention Art. 54).\r\n                   Proceedings Below\r\nOn October 19, 1994 Russo sued Baxter in the district\r\ncourt alleging injury from Baxter's December 1991 publication of\r\nthe catheter at the Atlanta convention.  During discovery Russo\r\nfirst learned that earlier--in 1990--Baxter had conducted the bench\r\ntrials and field tests on the catheter without any confidentiality\r\nagreements.  Russo amended his complaint to encompass those earlier\r\nactivities and asserted that the initial disclosures (1) had\r\nviolated his rights under the Rhode Island Uniform Trade Secrets\r\nAct, (2) had interfered with his prospective business relationships\r\nand (3) had negligently injured him by rendering his device\r\nunpatentable in foreign countries.  \r\nAs stated at the outset of this opinion, when Russo\r\nclosed his proofs at trial, Baxter sought judgment as a matter of\r\nlaw under Rule 50(a).  On May 29, 1997 the district court delivered\r\nan oral opinion granting Baxter's motion on all three counts\r\nbecause Russo had failed to establish that Baxter had either caused\r\nhis injury or disclosed his trade secret.  In addition, the\r\ndistrict court determined that the statute of limitations had run\r\non the trade secret count, that Russo had no prospective\r\ncontractual relationships--thus eliminating the second count--and\r\nthat Russo's claimed damages were purely speculative in any event. \r\nThis appeal followed.\r\n                       Causation   All of Russo's claims depend on his ability to establish\r\ndamages flowing from Baxter's actions--and that in turn depends on\r\nthe requisite causal nexus between Baxter's actions and Russo's\r\nfailure to obtain any valid foreign patents.  But it has already\r\nbeen said that Russo never actually applied for the foreign patents\r\nbecause of Doherty's bad advice--because Doherty wrongly counseled\r\nRusso that Baxter's disclosure of his catheter at the 1991 Atlanta\r\nconvention had disqualified his invention for foreign patent\r\npurposes.  That advice led the district court to conclude that\r\nDoherty's \"egregious legal malpractice\" had acted as an independent\r\nintervening cause that insulated Baxter from any liability for its\r\nbehavior at the Atlanta convention.  \r\nRusso now claims that the Baxter-sponsored bench trials\r\nand field tests in 1990 had already caused the harm of which he\r\ncomplains.  As Russo would have it, those tests--conducted over a\r\nyear before he consulted with Doherty--make his failure to apply\r\nfor patents in 1991 irrelevant, because he could not then have\r\ntaken advantage of the six-month grace period even if Doherty had\r\ncorrectly understood foreign patent doctrine (as he did not). \r\nRusso is essentially contending that although Doherty's legal\r\nanalysis was wrong, his ultimate conclusion of no foreign\r\npatentability was right because Baxter's disclosures had earlier--\r\nin 1990--doomed Russo's ability to get the foreign patents.\r\nThat argument founders on a fundamental point of law and\r\nan equally fundamental point of logic.  As to the former, Russo\r\nmust show both causation in fact and proximate causation to recover\r\nagainst Baxter.  Breach of a legal duty is a cause in fact of harm\r\nif that harm would not have occurred but for the breach\r\n(Restatement (Second) of Torts (\"Restatement\")  432(1)(1965)). \r\nHere Russo has not shown, because he cannot show, that he would\r\nhave obtained foreign patents but for Baxter's 1990 disclosures.  \r\nWhether Russo would indeed ever have obtained foreign\r\npatents if it had not been for Baxter's unauthorized disclosures is\r\ntotally speculative--and it is rendered totally speculative by the\r\nfact that Russo never applied for such patents (so that, for\r\nexample, it can never be known whether some wholly separate and\r\ndifferent reason would have caused rejection of the applications). \r\nAnd of course Russo's failure to apply for them was not ascribable\r\nto Baxter, but was rather the consequence of Doherty having wrongly\r\nadvised Russo that any unauthorized disclosure by Baxter had\r\nrendered his catheter unpatentable abroad. \r\nBoth as a matter of law and as a matter of logic, Russo\r\ncannot separate the strands of causation by pointing to Baxter's\r\nearlier disclosures via the 1990 bench trials and field trials,\r\nwhile ignoring the import of the bad legal advice imparted to Russo\r\nby Doherty.  To construct a hypothetical scenario in terms of that\r\nearlier unauthorized disclosure, Russo is compelled to recognize\r\nthat it would not have made the slightest bit of difference if he\r\nhad been aware of it from the outset (rather than learning of it\r\nvia disclosure in this action):  Even an immediate consultation\r\nwith Doherty would have elicited the same wrong advice and would\r\nhave caused the same nonfiling of any foreign applications.  In\r\nsum, Russo fails the \"but for\" precondition to recovery under any\r\npermissible view of the facts. \r\nRusso nonetheless disputes whether Doherty's advice\r\nshould shield Baxter from liability, arguing that even if Doherty's\r\nconduct was an intervening force, it was not a superseding cause. \r\nIntervening forces insulate a party from liability only if they are\r\nnot foreseeable consequences of that party's original negligence\r\nor, in other words, if they are not \"a natural and probable\r\nconsequence of the initial tortfeasor's act\" (Walsh v. IsraelCouture Post, No. 2274 V.F.W., 542 A.2d 1094, 1097 (R.I. 1988)). \r\nRusso argues that Doherty's bad advice is not a superseding cause\r\nbecause it was a foreseeable consequence of Baxter's negligence.\r\nAny such determination of whether a third party's\r\nintervening cause is also a superseding cause, so as to negate\r\nproximate causation on the part of the primary tortfeasor, is\r\ngoverned by traditional tort rules.  Restatement 442 sets forth\r\nthe relevant factors in such a determination:\r\n  (a) the fact that its intervention brings\r\nabout harm different in kind from that which\r\nwould otherwise have resulted from the actor's\r\nnegligence;\r\n\n  (b) the fact that its operation or the\r\nconsequences thereof appear after the event to\r\nbe extraordinary rather than normal in view of\r\nthe circumstances existing at the time of its\r\noperation;\r\n\n  (c) the fact that the intervening force is\r\noperating independently of any situation\r\ncreated by the actor's negligence, or, on the\r\nother hand, is or is not a normal result of\r\nsuch a situation; \r\n\n  (d) the fact that the operation of the\r\nintervening force is due to a third person's\r\nact or to his failure to act;\r\n\n  (e) the fact that the intervening force is\r\ndue to an act of a third person which is\r\nwrongful toward the other and as such subjects\r\nthe third person to liability to him;\r\n\n  (f) the degree of culpability of a wrongful\r\nact of a third person which sets the\r\nintervening force in motion.\r\n\nIn this instance it is really unnecessary to go beyond\r\nthe first factor.  Doherty's bad advice produced a harm radically\r\ndifferent from that ascribable to Baxter's actions alone.  After\r\nall, it is really uncertain whether foreign patents would have\r\nissued on the strength of Russo's claimed invention even in the\r\nabsence of Baxter's unauthorized disclosures--and that uncertainty\r\ncan never be resolved, because the foreign patent offices were\r\nnever given that opportunity.  By contrast, what is really certain\r\nis that the reason that the opportunity was never given (and that\r\nthe opportunity would never have been given even in the context of\r\nthe original disclosures) was Doherty's wholly independent bad\r\nlegal advice.\r\nAlthough that alone would defeat Russo's attempted\r\ndistinction between intervening force and superseding cause, the\r\nsame conclusion is buttressed by the other Restatement factors. \r\nNone of them suggests that the intervention of Doherty's wrong\r\nadvice was foreseeable in any appropriate sense of that term.  Not\r\nonly was Doherty an unrelated third party acting outside of\r\nBaxter's control, but it can scarcely be found reasonably\r\nforeseeable that his legal advice would fall to the level of\r\nmalpractice as it did.  Doherty admitted that he lacked expertise\r\nin foreign patent law (his experience lay in domestic patent\r\nissues).  Yet when presented with a question that depended upon\r\nknowledge of patent law in numerous foreign jurisdictions, Doherty\r\ncounseled his client without troubling to conduct any research or\r\nto consult with a more knowledgeable lawyer.  Not surprisingly,\r\nthat reckless approach yielded advice clearly contrary to\r\nestablished foreign patent doctrine and misled Russo to believe\r\nthat he was barred from pursuing foreign patents when in fact he\r\nwas not.  \r\nSurely Doherty's legal advice was not only an independent\r\nforce, but was also an extraordinary rather than a normal event. \r\nIt must be concluded that Russo fares no better in his effort to\r\npigeonhole Baxter's conduct through the use of labels such as \"no-\r\nsuperseding-cause\" than he has done in the earlier analysis in this\r\nopinion.  We conclude that the district court was justified in\r\nconcluding that Doherty's poor advice was an intervening force that\r\ninsulated Baxter from liability.\r\nThat disposes of Russo's final causation argument.  In\r\nsum, while resolving causation is generally within the jury's\r\ndomain, the fact \"[t]hat causation is ordinarily a fact question\r\ndoes not make it invariably a fact question\" (Peckham v.\r\nContinental Casualty Ins. Co., 895 F.2d 830, 837 (1st Cir. 1990)\r\n(emphasis in original)).  Here Russo has not tendered the required\r\nevidence that the injury of which he complains--the nonissuance of\r\nforeign patents--would not have been suffered but for Baxter's\r\ndisclosures.  Hence he has not satisfied Katz's requirement that he\r\nshow \"more than a mere scintilla\" of evidence on causation, and it\r\nwas appropriate for the district court to have decided causation as\r\na matter of law.  And because the element of proximate cause is\r\nessential to each of Russo's claims, that calls for the denial of\r\nall three claims as a matter of law.\r\nIndeed, it is worth noting that in addition to negating\r\ncausation, Russo's failure to apply for foreign patents renders his\r\ndamages claims wholly speculative as well.  That inaction on his\r\npart has made it impossible for Russo and Doherty to identify with\r\nany specificity the countries in which they would have sought (and,\r\nbut for Baxter's conduct, would even presumptively have obtained)\r\npatents and marketed the catheter.\r\nRelatedly, Russo could only ask a jury to guess to what\r\ndegree his invention would have been accepted commercially in those\r\nmarkets or how he would have profited from that acceptance.  In\r\nfact, the actual sales performance of Russo's device suggests that\r\nhis product would not be accepted in foreign markets.  No company\r\nsells the catheter anywhere in the world, even though it could be\r\nmanufactured and sold abroad unencumbered by any patent\r\nrestrictions or obligations to pay royalties.  That total absence\r\nfrom the market may reflect the flaws with the product identified\r\nin Baxter's field trials.  Hence, lacking anything but sheer\r\nspeculation as to his asserted damages, Russo's claims would also\r\nfail as a matter of law at that stage of analysis.  Conclusion\r\nIn light of our determination on the causation issue,\r\nwhich reaches all three of Russo's claims, there is no need to\r\nrevisit  in any detail any of the district court's additional\r\ngrounds for granting Baxter's Rule 50(a) motion.

To that end, in April 1990 Brodsky and Baxter discussed an agreement under which Baxter would manufacture and distribute the device.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  As part of its evaluation of the product, Baxter sent prototypes of the catheter to two clinicians so they could conduct bench trials.  Baxter did not require that either clinician sign a confidentiality agreement before doing so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May Brodsky told Russo about his discussions with Baxter (but not about the bench trials).  Russo asked that Baxter be required to sign a confidentiality agreement, and Brodsky orally agreed to obtain one.  Later in May Russo stopped working with Superior because of a dispute over money and issues unrelated to this action.  Nonetheless, Russo retained some access to Superior's offices and observed that Superior continued to develop his catheter.  He also learned that in June Baxter and Superior had entered into an Exclusive Distribution Agreement (\"Agreement\") that granted Baxter an option to obtain rights in the catheter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Russo acted promptly in response to that discovery, sending two letters to Baxter asserting that he held the rights to the catheter.  On June 14 he also filed an application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\"PTO\") for a patent on the catheter, and on June 25 he sued Superior and Baxter in Rhode Island Superior Court, seeking an injunction to prevent both companies from implementing the Agreement.  Baxter and Superior promptly countered in July by submitting their own application to the PTO for a United States patent on the catheter.  In addition Baxter, without Russo's knowledge, conducted additional field trials on the catheter from June to August.  As part of those field trials, Baxter sent out samples of the device to 14 hospitals around the United States to solicit practitioner comments.  Again Baxter did not require that the participants in its field trials agree to keep the catheter confidential.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over a year later, in late October 1991, Russo's patent attorney Robert Doherty (\"Doherty\") received a Notice of Allowance from the PTO informing him that Russo's United States patent application had been approved.  Doherty paid the mandatory issuance fee and expected that the PTO would issue the patent within two or three months.  In November 1991 Russo discussed filing patent applications in foreign countries with Doherty.  They agreed on a tentative list of target countries, and Doherty sought out a consultant in foreign patent law because he lacked sufficient contacts and knowledge to file patents in most foreign countries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 9, 1991 Baxter displayed Russo's closed suction tracheal catheter at the American Association of Respiratory Care convention in Atlanta.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Baxter demonstrated the catheter, incorporated it into a sales brochure and took some sales leads on it.  Russo did not authorize any of those activities, and he did not discover what Baxter had done until several days after the convention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Russo immediately told Doherty about Baxter's unauthorized disclosure of his product at the convention (at that point Russo did not know about the earlier bench trials and field tests).  Without performing any research or consulting with his foreign patent expert, Doherty advised Russo that Baxter's disclosures at the convention had destroyed the novelty of his invention and thus made it unpatentable in any foreign country other than Canada or possibly Australia.  Doherty told Russo that no foreign patent applications should even be filed, because he believed that no patents could issue after Baxter's publication at the Atlanta convention--or alternatively, that any patents that might issue would be invalid and worthless.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Doherty's legal advice was dead wrong.  Under the European Patent Convention and the law of most industrialized countries, an unauthorized disclosure of an invention does not immediately destroy its novelty (and thus foreclose the inventor's ability to patent the invention).  Instead, such an adverse disclosure bars only patent applications made more than six months after the date of the disclosure (Art. 55 of the Convention on the Grant of European Patents, as printed in European Patent Convention (4th ed., Munich:  European Patent Office, 1987)).  That being so, Doherty should instead have advised Russo that he could still apply for foreign patents, because Baxter's actions at the Atlanta convention would not by themselves have affected Russo's ability to obtain such patents if applied for during the six-month window period after December 9, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What is critical to this litigation is that Russo relied upon Doherty's flawed advice and decided not to seek patents abroad.  As a consequence, Doherty did nothing more to prepare any foreign patent applications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 28, 1992 the PTO issued a patent to Russo on his catheter.  That unquestionably barred Russo from obtaining any foreign patents because that publication of the catheter--made under the auspices of Russo himself, rather than by some unauthorized third party--made it a part of the \"state of the art,\" so that it was not a \"new\" invention for foreign patent purposes.  That destroyed the invention's eligibility for such patents (European Patent Convention Art. 54).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Proceedings Below</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 19, 1994 Russo sued Baxter in the district court alleging injury from Baxter's December 1991 publication of the catheter at the Atlanta convention.  During discovery Russo first learned that earlier--in 1990--Baxter had conducted the bench trials and field tests on the catheter without any confidentiality agreements.  Russo amended his complaint to encompass those earlier activities and asserted that the initial disclosures (1) had violated his rights under the Rhode Island Uniform Trade Secrets Act, (2) had interfered with his prospective business relationships and (3) had negligently injured him by rendering his device unpatentable in foreign countries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As stated at the outset of this opinion, when Russo closed his proofs at trial, Baxter sought judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(a).  On May 29, 1997 the district court delivered an oral opinion granting Baxter's motion on all three counts because Russo had failed to establish that Baxter had either caused his injury or disclosed his trade secret.  In addition, the district court determined that the statute of limitations had run on the trade secret count, that Russo had no prospective contractual relationships--thus eliminating the second count--and that Russo's claimed damages were purely speculative in any event.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Causation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of Russo's claims depend on his ability to establish damages flowing from Baxter's actions--and that in turn depends on the requisite causal nexus between Baxter's actions and Russo's failure to obtain any valid foreign patents.  But it has already been said that Russo never actually applied for the foreign patents because of Doherty's bad advice--because Doherty wrongly counseled Russo that Baxter's disclosure of his catheter at the 1991 Atlanta convention<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> had disqualified his invention for foreign patent purposes.  That advice led the district court to conclude that Doherty's \"egregious legal malpractice\" had acted as an independent intervening cause that insulated Baxter from any liability for its behavior at the Atlanta convention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Russo now claims that the Baxter-sponsored bench trials and field tests in 1990 had already caused the harm of which he complains.  As Russo would have it, those tests--conducted over a year before he consulted with Doherty--make his failure to apply for patents in 1991 irrelevant, because he could not then have taken advantage of the six-month grace period even if Doherty had correctly understood foreign patent doctrine (as he did not).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Russo is essentially contending that although Doherty's legal analysis was wrong, his ultimate conclusion of no foreign patentability was right because Baxter's disclosures had earlier--in 1990--doomed Russo's ability to get the foreign patents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That argument founders on a fundamental point of law and an equally fundamental point of logic.  As to the former, Russo must show both causation in fact and proximate causation to recover against Baxter.  Breach of a legal duty is a cause in fact of harm if that harm would not have occurred but for the breach (Restatement (Second) of Torts (\"Restatement\") &#167; 432(1)(1965)).  Here Russo has not shown, because he cannot show, that he would have obtained foreign patents but for Baxter's 1990 disclosures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether Russo would indeed ever have obtained foreign patents if it had not been for Baxter's unauthorized disclosures is totally speculative--and it is rendered totally speculative by the fact that Russo never applied for such patents (so that, for example, it can never be known whether some wholly separate and different reason would have caused rejection of the applications).  And of course Russo's failure to apply for them was not ascribable to Baxter, but was rather the consequence of Doherty having wrongly advised Russo that any unauthorized disclosure by Baxter had rendered his catheter unpatentable abroad.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both as a matter of law and as a matter of logic, Russo cannot separate the strands of causation by pointing to Baxter's earlier disclosures via the 1990 bench trials and field trials, while ignoring the import of the bad legal advice imparted to Russo by Doherty. To construct a hypothetical scenario in terms of that earlier unauthorized disclosure, Russo is compelled to recognize that it would not have made the slightest bit of difference if he had been aware of it from the outset (rather than learning of it via disclosure in this action):  Even an immediate consultation with Doherty would have elicited the same wrong advice and would have caused the same nonfiling of any foreign applications.  In sum, Russo fails the \"but for\" precondition to recovery under any permissible view of the facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Russo nonetheless disputes whether Doherty's advice should shield Baxter from liability, arguing that even if Doherty's conduct was an intervening force, it was not a superseding cause.  Intervening forces insulate a party from liability only if they are not foreseeable consequences of that party's original negligence or, in other words, if they are not \"a natural and probable consequence of the initial tortfeasor's act\" (Walsh v. Israel Couture Post, No. 2274 V.F.W., 542 A.2d 1094, 1097 (R.I.1988)).  Russo argues that Doherty's bad advice is not a superseding cause because it was a foreseeable consequence of Baxter's negligence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any such determination of whether a third party's intervening cause is also a superseding cause, so as to negate proximate causation on the part of the primary tortfeasor, is governed by traditional tort rules.  Restatement &#167; 442 sets forth the relevant factors in such a determination:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) the fact that its intervention brings about harm different in kind from that which would otherwise have resulted from the actor's negligence;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) the fact that its operation or the consequences thereof appear after the event to be extraordinary rather than normal in view of the circumstances existing at the time of its operation;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) the fact that the intervening force is operating independently of any situation created by the actor's negligence, or, on the other hand, is or is not a normal result of such a situation;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(d) the fact that the operation of the intervening force is due to a third person's act or to his failure to act;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(e) the fact that the intervening force is due to an act of a third person which is wrongful toward the other and as such subjects the third person to liability to him;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(f) the degree of culpability of a wrongful act of a third person which sets the intervening force in motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance it is really unnecessary to go beyond the first factor.  Doherty's bad advice produced a harm radically different from that ascribable to Baxter's actions alone.  After all, it is really uncertain whether foreign patents would have issued on the strength of Russo's claimed invention even in the absence of Baxter's unauthorized disclosures--and that uncertainty can never be resolved, because the foreign patent offices were never given that opportunity.  By contrast, what is really certain is that the reason that the opportunity was never given (and that the opportunity would never have been given even in the context of the original disclosures)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> was Doherty's wholly independent bad legal advice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although that alone would defeat Russo's attempted distinction between intervening force and superseding cause, the same conclusion is buttressed by the other Restatement factors.  None of them suggests that the intervention of Doherty's wrong advice was foreseeable in any appropriate sense of that term.  Not only was Doherty an unrelated third party acting outside of Baxter's control, but it can scarcely be found reasonably foreseeable that his legal advice would fall to the level of malpractice as it did.  Doherty admitted that he lacked expertise in foreign patent law (his experience lay in domestic patent issues).  Yet when presented with a question that depended upon knowledge of patent law in numerous foreign jurisdictions, Doherty counseled his client without troubling to conduct any research or to consult with a more knowledgeable lawyer.  Not surprisingly, that reckless approach yielded advice clearly contrary to established foreign patent doctrine and misled Russo to believe that he was barred from pursuing foreign patents when in fact he was not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Surely Doherty's legal advice was not only an independent force, but was also an extraordinary rather than a normal event.  It must be concluded that Russo fares no better in his effort to pigeonhole Baxter's conduct through the use of labels such as \"no-superseding-cause\" than he has done in the earlier analysis in this opinion.  We conclude that the district court was justified in concluding that Doherty's poor advice was an intervening force that insulated Baxter from liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That disposes of Russo's final causation argument.  In sum, while resolving causation is generally within the jury's domain, the fact \"[t]hat causation is ordinarily a fact question does not make it invariably a fact question\" (Peckham v. Continental Casualty Ins. Co., 895 F.2d 830, 837 (1st Cir.1990) (emphasis in original)).  Here Russo has not tendered the required evidence that the injury of which he complains--the nonissuance of foreign patents--would not have been suffered but for Baxter's disclosures.  Hence he has not satisfied Katz 's requirement that he show \"more than a mere scintilla\" of evidence on causation, and it was appropriate for the district court to have decided causation as a matter of law.  And because the element of proximate cause is essential to each of Russo's claims, that calls for the denial of all three claims as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, it is worth noting that in addition to negating causation, Russo's failure to apply for foreign patents renders his damages claims wholly speculative as well.  That inaction on his part has made it impossible for Russo and Doherty to identify with any specificity the countries in which they would have sought (and, but for Baxter's conduct, would even presumptively have obtained) patents and marketed the catheter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relatedly, Russo could only ask a jury to guess to what degree his invention would have been accepted commercially in those markets or how he would have profited from that acceptance.  In fact, the actual sales performance of Russo's device suggests that his product would not be accepted in foreign markets.  No company sells the catheter anywhere in the world, even though it could be manufactured and sold abroad unencumbered by any patent restrictions or obligations to pay royalties.  That total absence from the market may reflect the flaws with the product identified in Baxter's field trials.  Hence, lacking anything but sheer speculation as to his asserted damages, Russo's claims would also fail as a matter of law at that stage of analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of our determination on the causation issue, which reaches all three of Russo's claims, there is no need to revisit in any detail any of the district court's additional grounds for granting Baxter's Rule 50(a) motion.

In 1989 Russo developed a new kind of closed-seal tracheal suction catheter, a device that uses an endotracheal tube to clear the airways of patients breathing on a mechanical ventilator.  Russo's catheter had unique features, such as a rear irrigation port and a clamp valve, that distinguished it from others on the market.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Russo disclosed his idea for the improved catheter to Superior's President David Brodsky (\"Brodsky\").  Because Brodsky considered that Superior lacked the ability to market such a product, he sought another company to fill that role.  To that end, in April 1990 Brodsky and Baxter discussed an agreement under which Baxter would manufacture and distribute the device.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  As part of its evaluation of the product, Baxter sent prototypes of the catheter to two clinicians so they could conduct bench trials.

Later in May Russo stopped working with Superior because of a dispute over money and issues unrelated to this action.  Nonetheless, Russo retained some access to Superior's offices and observed that Superior continued to develop his catheter.  He also learned that in June Baxter and Superior had entered into an Exclusive Distribution Agreement (\"Agreement\") that granted Baxter an option to obtain rights in the catheter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Russo acted promptly in response to that discovery, sending two letters to Baxter asserting that he held the rights to the catheter.  On June 14 he also filed an application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\"PTO\") for a patent on the catheter, and on June 25 he sued Superior and Baxter in Rhode Island Superior Court, seeking an injunction to prevent both companies from implementing the Agreement.  Baxter and Superior promptly countered in July by submitting their own application to the PTO for a United States patent on the catheter.  In addition Baxter, without Russo's knowledge, conducted additional field trials on the catheter from June to August.  As part of those field trials, Baxter sent out samples of the device to 14 hospitals around the United States to solicit practitioner comments.  Again Baxter did not require that the participants in its field trials agree to keep the catheter confidential.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over a year later, in late October 1991, Russo's patent attorney Robert Doherty (\"Doherty\") received a Notice of Allowance from the PTO informing him that Russo's United States patent application had been approved.  Doherty paid the mandatory issuance fee and expected that the PTO would issue the patent within two or three months.  In November 1991 Russo discussed filing patent applications in foreign countries with Doherty.  They agreed on a tentative list of target countries, and Doherty sought out a consultant in foreign patent law because he lacked sufficient contacts and knowledge to file patents in most foreign countries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 9, 1991 Baxter displayed Russo's closed suction tracheal catheter at the American Association of Respiratory Care convention in Atlanta.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Baxter demonstrated the catheter, incorporated it into a sales brochure and took some sales leads on it.  Russo did not authorize any of those activities, and he did not discover what Baxter had done until several days after the convention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Russo immediately told Doherty about Baxter's unauthorized disclosure of his product at the convention (at that point Russo did not know about the earlier bench trials and field tests).  Without performing any research or consulting with his foreign patent expert, Doherty advised Russo that Baxter's disclosures at the convention had destroyed the novelty of his invention and thus made it unpatentable in any foreign country other than Canada or possibly Australia.  Doherty told Russo that no foreign patent applications should even be filed, because he believed that no patents could issue after Baxter's publication at the Atlanta convention--or alternatively, that any patents that might issue would be invalid and worthless.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Doherty's legal advice was dead wrong.  Under the European Patent Convention and the law of most industrialized countries, an unauthorized disclosure of an invention does not immediately destroy its novelty (and thus foreclose the inventor's ability to patent the invention).  Instead, such an adverse disclosure bars only patent applications made more than six months after the date of the disclosure (Art. 55 of the Convention on the Grant of European Patents, as printed in European Patent Convention (4th ed., Munich:  European Patent Office, 1987)).  That being so, Doherty should instead have advised Russo that he could still apply for foreign patents, because Baxter's actions at the Atlanta convention would not by themselves have affected Russo's ability to obtain such patents if applied for during the six-month window period after December 9, 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What is critical to this litigation is that Russo relied upon Doherty's flawed advice and decided not to seek patents abroad.  As a consequence, Doherty did nothing more to prepare any foreign patent applications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 28, 1992 the PTO issued a patent to Russo on his catheter.  That unquestionably barred Russo from obtaining any foreign patents because that publication of the catheter--made under the auspices of Russo himself, rather than by some unauthorized third party--made it a part of the \"state of the art,\" so that it was not a \"new\" invention for foreign patent purposes.  That destroyed the invention's eligibility for such patents (European Patent Convention Art. 54).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Proceedings Below</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 19, 1994 Russo sued Baxter in the district court alleging injury from Baxter's December 1991 publication of the catheter at the Atlanta convention.  During discovery Russo first learned that earlier--in 1990--Baxter had conducted the bench trials and field tests on the catheter without any confidentiality agreements.  Russo amended his complaint to encompass those earlier activities and asserted that the initial disclosures (1) had violated his rights under the Rhode Island Uniform Trade Secrets Act, (2) had interfered with his prospective business relationships and (3) had negligently injured him by rendering his device unpatentable in foreign countries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As stated at the outset of this opinion, when Russo closed his proofs at trial, Baxter sought judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(a).  On May 29, 1997 the district court delivered an oral opinion granting Baxter's motion on all three counts because Russo had failed to establish that Baxter had either caused his injury or disclosed his trade secret.  In addition, the district court determined that the statute of limitations had run on the trade secret count, that Russo had no prospective contractual relationships--thus eliminating the second count--and that Russo's claimed damages were purely speculative in any event.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Causation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of Russo's claims depend on his ability to establish damages flowing from Baxter's actions--and that in turn depends on the requisite causal nexus between Baxter's actions and Russo's failure to obtain any valid foreign patents.  But it has already been said that Russo never actually applied for the foreign patents because of Doherty's bad advice--because Doherty wrongly counseled Russo that Baxter's disclosure of his catheter at the 1991 Atlanta convention<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> had disqualified his invention for foreign patent purposes.  That advice led the district court to conclude that Doherty's \"egregious legal malpractice\" had acted as an independent intervening cause that insulated Baxter from any liability for its behavior at the Atlanta convention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Russo now claims that the Baxter-sponsored bench trials and field tests in 1990 had already caused the harm of which he complains.  As Russo would have it, those tests--conducted over a year before he consulted with Doherty--make his failure to apply for patents in 1991 irrelevant, because he could not then have taken advantage of the six-month grace period even if Doherty had correctly understood foreign patent doctrine (as he did not).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Russo is essentially contending that although Doherty's legal analysis was wrong, his ultimate conclusion of no foreign patentability was right because Baxter's disclosures had earlier--in 1990--doomed Russo's ability to get the foreign patents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That argument founders on a fundamental point of law and an equally fundamental point of logic.  As to the former, Russo must show both causation in fact and proximate causation to recover against Baxter.  Breach of a legal duty is a cause in fact of harm if that harm would not have occurred but for the breach (Restatement (Second) of Torts (\"Restatement\") &#167; 432(1)(1965)).  Here Russo has not shown, because he cannot show, that he would have obtained foreign patents but for Baxter's 1990 disclosures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether Russo would indeed ever have obtained foreign patents if it had not been for Baxter's unauthorized disclosures is totally speculative--and it is rendered totally speculative by the fact that Russo never applied for such patents (so that, for example, it can never be known whether some wholly separate and different reason would have caused rejection of the applications).  And of course Russo's failure to apply for them was not ascribable to Baxter, but was rather the consequence of Doherty having wrongly advised Russo that any unauthorized disclosure by Baxter had rendered his catheter unpatentable abroad.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both as a matter of law and as a matter of logic, Russo cannot separate the strands of causation by pointing to Baxter's earlier disclosures via the 1990 bench trials and field trials, while ignoring the import of the bad legal advice imparted to Russo by Doherty. To construct a hypothetical scenario in terms of that earlier unauthorized disclosure, Russo is compelled to recognize that it would not have made the slightest bit of difference if he had been aware of it from the outset (rather than learning of it via disclosure in this action):  Even an immediate consultation with Doherty would have elicited the same wrong advice and would have caused the same nonfiling of any foreign applications.  In sum, Russo fails the \"but for\" precondition to recovery under any permissible view of the facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Russo nonetheless disputes whether Doherty's advice should shield Baxter from liability, arguing that even if Doherty's conduct was an intervening force, it was not a superseding cause.  Intervening forces insulate a party from liability only if they are not foreseeable consequences of that party's original negligence or, in other words, if they are not \"a natural and probable consequence of the initial tortfeasor's act\" (Walsh v. Israel Couture Post, No. 2274 V.F.W., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1916424\"><a href=\"/opinion/1916424/walsh-v-israel-couture-post-no-2274/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1094</span></a></span>, 1097 (R.I.1988)).  Russo argues that Doherty's bad advice is not a superseding cause because it was a foreseeable consequence of Baxter's negligence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any such determination of whether a third party's intervening cause is also a superseding cause, so as to negate proximate causation on the part of the primary tortfeasor, is governed by traditional tort rules.  Restatement &#167; 442 sets forth the relevant factors in such a determination:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) the fact that its intervention brings about harm different in kind from that which would otherwise have resulted from the actor's negligence;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) the fact that its operation or the consequences thereof appear after the event to be extraordinary rather than normal in view of the circumstances existing at the time of its operation;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) the fact that the intervening force is operating independently of any situation created by the actor's negligence, or, on the other hand, is or is not a normal result of such a situation;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(d) the fact that the operation of the intervening force is due to a third person's act or to his failure to act;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(e) the fact that the intervening force is due to an act of a third person which is wrongful toward the other and as such subjects the third person to liability to him;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(f) the degree of culpability of a wrongful act of a third person which sets the intervening force in motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance it is really unnecessary to go beyond the first factor.  Doherty's bad advice produced a harm radically different from that ascribable to Baxter's actions alone.  After all, it is really uncertain whether foreign patents would have issued on the strength of Russo's claimed invention even in the absence of Baxter's unauthorized disclosures--and that uncertainty can never be resolved, because the foreign patent offices were never given that opportunity.  By contrast, what is really certain is that the reason that the opportunity was never given (and that the opportunity would never have been given even in the context of the original disclosures)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> was Doherty's wholly independent bad legal advice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although that alone would defeat Russo's attempted distinction between intervening force and superseding cause, the same conclusion is buttressed by the other Restatement factors.  None of them suggests that the intervention of Doherty's wrong advice was foreseeable in any appropriate sense of that term.  Not only was Doherty an unrelated third party acting outside of Baxter's control, but it can scarcely be found reasonably foreseeable that his legal advice would fall to the level of malpractice as it did.  Doherty admitted that he lacked expertise in foreign patent law (his experience lay in domestic patent issues).  Yet when presented with a question that depended upon knowledge of patent law in numerous foreign jurisdictions, Doherty counseled his client without troubling to conduct any research or to consult with a more knowledgeable lawyer.  Not surprisingly, that reckless approach yielded advice clearly contrary to established foreign patent doctrine and misled Russo to believe that he was barred from pursuing foreign patents when in fact he was not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Surely Doherty's legal advice was not only an independent force, but was also an extraordinary rather than a normal event.  It must be concluded that Russo fares no better in his effort to pigeonhole Baxter's conduct through the use of labels such as \"no-superseding-cause\" than he has done in the earlier analysis in this opinion.  We conclude that the district court was justified in concluding that Doherty's poor advice was an intervening force that insulated Baxter from liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That disposes of Russo's final causation argument.  In sum, while resolving causation is generally within the jury's domain, the fact \"[t]hat causation is ordinarily a fact question does not make it invariably a fact question\" (Peckham v. Continental Casualty Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536169\"><a href=\"/opinion/536169/scott-peckham-v-continental-casualty-insurance-co-scott-peckham-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">830</span></a></span>, 837 (1st Cir.1990) (emphasis in original)).  Here Russo has not tendered the required evidence that the injury of which he complains--the nonissuance of foreign patents--would not have been suffered but for Baxter's disclosures.  Hence he has not satisfied Katz 's requirement that he show \"more than a mere scintilla\" of evidence on causation, and it was appropriate for the district court to have decided causation as a matter of law.  And because the element of proximate cause is essential to each of Russo's claims, that calls for the denial of all three claims as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, it is worth noting that in addition to negating causation, Russo's failure to apply for foreign patents renders his damages claims wholly speculative as well.  That inaction on his part has made it impossible for Russo and Doherty to identify with any specificity the countries in which they would have sought (and, but for Baxter's conduct, would even presumptively have obtained) patents and marketed the catheter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relatedly, Russo could only ask a jury to guess to what degree his invention would have been accepted commercially in those markets or how he would have profited from that acceptance.  In fact, the actual sales performance of Russo's device suggests that his product would not be accepted in foreign markets.  No company sells the catheter anywhere in the world, even though it could be manufactured and sold abroad unencumbered by any patent restrictions or obligations to pay royalties.  That total absence from the market may reflect the flaws with the product identified in Baxter's field trials.  Hence, lacking anything but sheer speculation as to his asserted damages, Russo's claims would also fail as a matter of law at that stage of analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of our determination on the causation issue, which reaches all three of Russo's claims, there is no need to revisit in any detail any of the district court's additional grounds for granting Baxter's Rule 50(a) motion.
