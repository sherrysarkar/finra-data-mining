On  appeal,\r\n\nMcCarthy and Hunter challenge the district court's refusal to\r\n\ngrant their respective  suppression motions.   In particular,\r\n\nHunter challenges  the district  court's failure to  suppress\r\n\nevidence  produced as  the  result of  an investigatory  stop\r\n\nfollowing the Connecticut robbery.   McCarthy and Hunter also\r\n\nraise several  challenges to their sentences.   After careful\r\n\nreview, we affirm.\r\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \r\n\n                          Background\r                                      Background\r                                                \r\n\n          In reviewing a district  court's denial of  motions\r\n\nto suppress, we  recite the  facts as found  by the  district\r\n\ncourt  to the extent that they derive support from the record\r\n\nand are not clearly  erroneous.  See, e.g., United  States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nSealey,  30  F.3d  7, 8  (1st  Cir.  1994).   Where  specific\r                  \r\n\nfindings  are lacking, we view  the record in  the light most\r\n\nfavorable  to  the ruling,  making  all reasonably  supported\r\n\ninferences.  See United  States v. Kimball, 25 F.3d 1, 3 (1st\r                                                      \r\n\nCir.  1994); United States v. Sanchez, 943 F.2d 110, 112 (1st\r                                                 \r\n\nCir. 1991).\r\n\nA.  Hunter's Connecticut Detention\r                                              \r\n\n          On July 6, 1992, around 1:45 p.m., two men robbed a\r\n\nbank  in Franklin,  Connecticut.   Each  man wore  a plastic,\r\n\nHalloween-type mask,  covering his entire face,  and each was\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\narmed,  one with a pump-action  shotgun and the  other with a\r\n\nsemi-automatic pistol.  The man carrying the shotgun stood in\r\n\nthe bank's  lobby, issuing commands, while  the other vaulted\r\n\nthe  teller's counter and collected the money.  They fled the\r\n\nbank in a light-blue GMC Jimmy truck.\r\n\n          A short  time later,  the Connecticut  State Police\r\n\nlocated the truck,  abandoned in an industrial park less than\r\n\na mile from the  bank.  Witnesses reported that a red Pontiac\r\n\nSunbird bearing Rhode Island license plates recently had been\r\n\nparked near the spot where the abandoned GMC Jimmy was found.\r\n\nSubsequently,  the police  issued an updated  radio bulletin,\r\n\nindicating  that the  two suspects  were now  believed to  be\r\n\ntravelling in the red Pontiac Sunbird.\r\n\n          About  2:30 p.m.,  Officer  Arthur  Richard of  the\r\n\nNorwich  Police  Department  spotted  a red  Pontiac  Sunbird\r\n\nbearing Rhode Island license plates at a gas station, not far\r\n\nfrom Franklin.   Officer Richard reported  the sighting, and,\r\n\nafter the car  left the  station, stopped the  vehicle as  it\r\n\nprepared  to enter  an interstate  highway.   Officer Richard\r\n\nordered  the driver out of  the Sunbird, patted  him down for\r\n\nweapons and  directed him to take  a seat in the  back of his\r\n\npolice  cruiser.   The  police cruiser's  internal rear  door\r\n\nhandles  were not functional and  a plastic spit  guard and a\r\n\nwire cage  separated  its  rear  and front  seats.    Officer\r\n\nRichard did not handcuff the driver.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n          In response to  Officer Richard's questioning,  the\r\n\ndriver identified himself  as Hunter.  Officer Richard  ran a\r\n\nregistration check  on the  Sunbird and  learned that  it was\r\n\nregistered to  a rental  agency  at a  Rhode Island  airport.\r\n\nHunter told Richard  that a friend had  rented the automobile\r\n\nfor  him because  his  own car  was  under repair.    Hunter,\r\n\nhowever, refused to identify the friend.\r\n\n          Within  minutes,  several  other  police  officers,\r\n\nincluding Connecticut  State  Troopers Jerry  Hall and  Louis\r\n\nHeller, arrived on the  scene.  Trooper Hall spoke  to Hunter\r\n\nthrough  the open rear door of Richard's cruiser and detected\r\n\nalcohol on Hunter's  breath.  Hunter admitted  drinking a few\r\n\nbeers with a friend, but declined to identify the friend.  At\r\n\nHall's request, Hunter  took a field sobriety  test, which he\r\n\npassed.\r\n\n          About 2:43 p.m., Trooper Hall advised Hunter of his\r\n\nMiranda  rights and informed  him that,  although he  was not\r                   \r\n\nunder   arrest,  he  was  being  detained  for  investigative\r\n\npurposes.  Hunter  stated that he  understood his rights  and\r\n\nwaived them,  but nonetheless  declined to say  where he  had\r\n\nbeen  since 1:00 p.m., stating  only that he  had been with a\r\n\n\"Born-Again-Christian\" friend.   At some point, Trooper  Hall\r\n\nexplained that  the officers  were detaining him  because his\r\n\nPontiac  Sunbird matched  identically  the description  of  a\r\n\nvehicle involved in  a bank robbery that had occurred earlier\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nthat  day.    Trooper   Hall  continued  to  question  Hunter\r\n\nintermittently for  about  forty-five minutes.   During  that\r\n\ntime,  other officers  drove a  teller from  the bank  by the\r\n\ncruiser in an unsuccessful attempt to identify Hunter as  one\r\n\nof  the  robbers.    In addition,  Trooper  Hall  took  three\r\n\nPolaroid photographs of Hunter.\r\n\n          Meanwhile, Trooper Heller  learned that the  agency\r\n\nregistered as the owner of the Pontiac Sunbird had rented the\r\n\nvehicle to Lance Hall,  a black male, who had  listed Hunter,\r\n\nwho  is  white,  on the  rental  agreement  as a  co-driver.1\r\n\nAfter receiving this information, Heller went to a nearby bar\r\n\nand  questioned patrons  in an  attempt to  determine whether\r\n\nHunter  and another  individual  had  stopped there  earlier.\r\n\nUpon  returning to  the police  cruiser in  which Hunter  was\r\n\nstill being  detained, Trooper  Heller asked Hunter  where he\r\n\nhad  been prior to the stop.   Hunter replied that he had not\r\n\nbeen anywhere near Franklin, but instead had spent the day at\r\n\na  friend's place in the woods.  Hunter, however, claimed not\r\n\nto  remember  his  friend's  name  nor where  the  place  was\r\n\nlocated.  On  the basis  of the information  he had  obtained\r\n\nfrom the rental car agency,  Trooper Heller then asked Hunter\r\n\nif his friend was  black.  With this question,  Hunter became\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Trooper  Heller  obtained Lance  Hall's  driver's license\r\nnumber from  the  rental  agency.   He  obtained  a  physical\r\ndescription of Hall  after requesting a check on  the license\r\nwith the Connecticut State Police.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nagitated,  swore  at  Heller,  and, while  gesturing  in  one\r\n\ngeneral  direction, told him to  find out for  himself.  This\r\n\noccurred about 3:45  p.m., approximately seventy-five minutes\r\n\nafter Officer Richard initially stopped Hunter.\r\n\n          Trooper Heller  knew the area well  and could think\r\n\nof only one  black male  living in the  general direction  in\r\n\nwhich  Hunter had  gestured.    Consequently, Trooper  Heller\r\n\ndrove to that person's house and inquired  whether Hunter had\r\n\nvisited earlier that day.  The black male living at the house\r\n\nidentified himself as James  Hall and stated that  Hunter had\r\n\nbeen there with another  man named John.  According  to James\r\n\nHall, Hunter and John had borrowed James Hall's truck earlier\r\n\nin the day and had  later returned to Hall's house  to change\r\n\ntheir  clothes.    After   interviewing  James  Hall,  Heller\r\n\nreturned  to where  Hunter  was being  detained and,  at 4:43\r\n\np.m., Hunter was released.  \r\n\nB.  The Ensuing Investigation\r                                         \r\n\n          Following his release, Hunter remained the focus of\r\n\nthe   Franklin  robbery  investigation.    The  investigation\r\n\ninvolved a  cooperative effort between the  Connecticut State\r\n\nPolice,  the Federal  Bureau of  Investigation (\"FBI\"),  and,\r\n\nultimately, law enforcement  officials in Alabama and  Maine.\r\n\nDuring the course of  the investigation, James Hall2 revealed\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Investigators also learned that James Hall is the brother\r\nof  Lance Hall, the person who rented the Sunbird for Hunter.\r\nNeither  James nor Lance Hall  were involved, in  any way, in\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nto  investigators  that Hunter's  friend \"John\"  had recently\r\n\nreplaced his  Alabama  driver's license  with  a  Connecticut\r\n\nlicense  in  the  name  of  John  E.  Perry.    Investigators\r\n\nsubsequently learned that the real John E. Perry had lost his\r\n\nAlabama license prior  to the Franklin bank  robbery and that\r\n\nMcCarthy  had used the alias John  Perry in Florida following\r\n\nan  arrest there.3   The  real  John E.  Perry, who  lived in\r\n\nAlabama, identified McCarthy as James Hardiman, an individual\r\n\nwho had  been involved with  his former wife.   Investigators\r\n\nalso learned that,  in 1991,  Hunter and  McCarthy had  spent\r\n\ntime together as cellmates in a Connecticut state prison.\r\n\n          As   the   investigation  progressed,   Connecticut\r\n\nauthorities  apprised   FBI  agents  in  Alabama,   who  were\r\n\ninvestigating a series of  similar Alabama bank robberies, of\r\n\nthe events surrounding  the Franklin  robbery.   Accordingly,\r\n\nMcCarthy and Hunter became suspects in the Alabama robberies.\r\n\nIn early 1993, Alabama FBI Agent Marshall Ridlehoover learned\r\n\nthat McCarthy and Hunter  might be living in Chilton  County,\r\n\nAlabama.    Agent  Ridlehoover  alerted  the  Chilton  County\r\n\nSheriff's  Department that  the two  men  were suspects  in a\r\n\nseries of bank robberies in  Alabama and Connecticut and sent\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nthe Franklin robbery.\r\n\n3.  James Hall initially told investigators that a photograph\r\nof  the real John Perry  resembled the individual  he knew as\r\nHunter's  friend   \"John\".    Following   McCarthy's  arrest,\r\nhowever, James  Hall identified McCarthy  as Hunter's  friend\r\n\"John\".\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nthe   department  photographs   of   McCarthy   and   Hunter.\r\n\nInitially,  Ridlehoover  told  the  Chilton  County Sheriff's\r\n\nDepartment that the FBI wanted to have the two men kept under\r\n\nsurveillance.      Subsequently,  Ridlehoover   informed  the\r\n\nSheriff's  Department  that  a  federal  arrest  warrant  for\r\n\nunlawful flight from prosecution had been issued for Hunter.\r\n\nC.  Alabama Arrests of Hunter and McCarthy\r                                                      \r\n\n          While driving to work on  the morning of April  23,\r\n\n1993,  Deputy Wayne  Fulmer,  assistant chief  deputy of  the\r\n\nChilton County  Sheriff's Department, noticed  a pickup truck\r\n\nbearing  Maine license plates.  Because the presence of Maine\r\n\nplates in Chilton County struck  Fulmer as rather unusual, he\r\n\nran a registration check on the truck and discovered that the\r\n\ntruck was registered to a John E. Perry.  Fulmer knew at this\r\n\ntime that  FBI investigators  were looking for  an individual\r\n\nusing the alias  John E. Perry in connection with a series of\r\n\nbank robberies in Connecticut and Alabama.  \r\n\n          Later  that morning,  a  woman at  the local  power\r\n\ncompany, who had been shown a  photograph of Hunter, reported\r\n\nthat a person  resembling Hunter had requested that  power be\r\n\nturned  on at  his  trailer.   After  receiving this  report,\r\n\nFulmer brought a copy of Hunter's photograph to the woman and\r\n\nasked  her to  notify  the Sheriff's  Department  if the  man\r\n\nreturned.   A short time  later that day,  the woman reported\r\n\nthat Hunter had  returned.  Upon  learning this, Fulmer  left\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nfor the power company and requested  several back-up units to\r\n\nmeet him  there.   On the  way, Fulmer alerted  by radio  the\r\n\nother officers  responding to  the scene that  an outstanding\r\n\nfederal  warrant  existed for  Hunter's  arrest.   The  first\r\n\nofficer to arrive at the  power company identified himself to\r\n\nHunter and asked to speak to him.  In response, Hunter turned\r\n\nand ran.  The officer radioed that the suspect was fleeing on\r\n\nfoot and then gave chase.  \r\n\n          Several  officers  eventually  caught and  arrested\r\n\nHunter.    A  search  incident  to the  arrest  disclosed  an\r\n\nenvelope containing $6039  in cash on Hunter's person.   Over\r\n\ntwo weeks later,  on May 11, 1993,  Agent Ridlehoover matched\r\n\nthe serial numbers of twenty bills taken from the envelope to\r\n\nbills stolen from the Casco Northern Bank in Falmouth, Maine,\r\n\non April 12, 1993.\r\n\n          While  Hunter was fleeing  on foot,  Deputy Fulmer,\r\n\nwho  had yet  to reach  the power  company, spotted  the same\r\n\npickup truck, which he  had seen earlier in the  day, heading\r\n\naway  from  the power  company.   Fulmer directed  an Alabama\r\n\nstate trooper who was  following him to turn around  and stop\r\n\nthe truck.  At  this point, Fulmer did not  know the identity\r\n\nof either the person driving the  truck or the person who had\r\n\nfled  on foot.  After  stopping the truck,  the state trooper\r\n\nasked  the driver  for  identification.   The  driver of  the\r\n\ntruck, McCarthy, falsely identified  himself as John E. Perry\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nand gave the  trooper a Maine  driver's license bearing  that\r\n\nname.  \r\n\n          Subsequently about  12:15 p.m., McCarthy  was taken\r\n\ninto  custody   and  transported   to   the  Chilton   County\r\n\nCourthouse.  McCarthy was searched and approximately $2000 in\r\n\ncash  was  found  on  his  person.    Shortly after  stopping\r\n\nMcCarthy,  an  official  from the  Chilton  County  Sheriff's\r\n\nDepartment  notified Connecticut officials  that McCarthy was\r\n\nin  custody.   The Connecticut  officials requested  that the\r\n\nChilton County Sheriff's Department continue to hold McCarthy\r\n\nwhile they  attempted to  secure an arrest  warrant based  on\r\n\nMcCarthy's  alleged participation  in  the Franklin  robbery.\r\n\nSometime after midnight, a  Connecticut Superior Judge signed\r\n\nan arrest warrant  for McCarthy for his  participation in the\r\n\nFranklin robbery.4  \r\n\nD.   Search and  Seizure of  McCarthy's Suitcases, Truck  and\r                                                                         \r\n\n          Storage Unit\r                                  \r\n\n          On  the  evening  of April  23,  1993,  the  day of\r\n\nMcCarthy's  arrest  in  Alabama,  Deputy  Fulmer  received  a\r\n\ntelephone  call from  Chilton County  resident Gene  Ellison.\r\n\nEllison told Fulmer that McCarthy and Hunter had been staying\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  Several months later, the Connecticut prosecution against\r\nMcCarthy  was  dismissed   without  prejudice  following  the\r\ndiscovery that the affidavit  on which the Connecticut arrest\r\nwarrant  was based included  an incorrect  factual statement.\r\nBecause the disposition of this appeal does not depend on the\r\nvalidity of the Connecticut arrest warrant, we do not discuss\r\nit further.\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nwith  his  neighbor, Joe  Henderson,  and  that McCarthy  and\r\n\nHunter had left some items in Henderson's trailer that Fulmer\r\n\nshould  see.   Deputy Fulmer  agreed to  come by  Henderson's\r\n\ntrailer.   When  he arrived, Fulmer  found a  maroon suitcase\r\n\nlaying open on  Henderson's kitchen table.   An AK-47 assault\r\n\nrifle, a pistol, extra clips and a bullet-proof vest sat atop\r\n\nthe suitcase in plain  view.  Henderson told Fulmer  that the\r\n\nsuitcase and its contents belonged to McCarthy  and asked him\r\n\nto take possession of them.\r\n\n          Henderson further explained  that he had  permitted\r\n\nMcCarthy and Hunter to stay with him for the past six days in\r\n\nreturn  for $40  rent.   Henderson knew  McCarthy and  Hunter\r\n\nbecause the  two men  had  previously rented  a trailer  from\r\n\nHenderson's  landlord,  J.B.  Ellison.   While  staying  with\r\n\nHenderson,  McCarthy and Hunter had  slept on a  couch and an\r\n\neasy  chair in  Henderson's living  room and  had  kept their\r\n\nbelongings in a back bedroom that Henderson used for storage.\r\n\nOn Thursday,  April 22, the day before the arrests, Henderson\r\n\nhad told the two  men that he was  expecting company for  the\r\n\nupcoming weekend and  that they  would have to  leave.   When\r\n\nHenderson  left  for work  on  the  morning of  the  arrests,\r\n\nMcCarthy  and  Hunter  were  preparing  to  move  out  of the\r\n\ntrailer.\r\n\n          When Henderson  returned home that  afternoon, Gene\r\n\nEllison told him  that the police  had arrested McCarthy  and\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nHunter.  Henderson then  decided to check his trailer  to see\r\n\nif  McCarthy and  Hunter had  left anything  behind.   In the\r\n\nstorage  room, he  found two  suitcases, the  maroon suitcase\r\n\nthat  was  closed  and  locked,  and  an  American  Tourister\r\n\nsuitcase  that was laying open  with clothes piled  on top of\r\n\nit.  Henderson attempted  to move the maroon suitcase  out of\r\n\nthe room to a storage shed behind his trailer but was  unable\r\n\nto do so because the  suitcase was too heavy.  He  asked Gene\r\n\nEllison to help  him.   Ellison moved the  suitcase into  the\r\n\nother room and cut the  lock off of it  in order to find  out\r\n\nwhy it  weighed so  much.   After Ellison  cut off  the lock,\r\n\nHenderson opened the suitcase and discovered the weapons, the\r\n\nbullet-proof  vest  and  other   items.    Some  time  later,\r\n\nHenderson  decided  he  should  turn  the  suitcase  and  its\r\n\ncontents over  to the police so he  asked Ellison to call the\r\n\nsheriff's department.\r\n\n          During  Deputy Fulmer's  visit  on the  evening  of\r\n\nApril 23, Henderson failed  to tell him about the  additional\r\n\nAmerican   Tourister   suitcase  Henderson   had  discovered.\r\n\nSeveral  days later,  however,  Henderson told  an FBI  agent\r\n\nabout it during an interview.  Later, at Henderson's request,\r\n\nFulmer  and  FBI agent  Rich  Schott took  possession  of the\r\n\nsuitcase.     Agent  Ridlehoover   inventoried  the  American\r\n\nTourister on May 1, 1993, pursuant to standard  FBI practice.\r\n\nNo warrant was obtained for the suitcase.\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\n          Following  McCarthy's Alabama arrest, a warrant was\r\n\nobtained on  April  28, 1993,  to  search his  pickup  truck.\r\n\nAccordingly,  investigators  searched  the truck,  finding  a\r\n\nreceipt  for a  storage unit  located in  Scarborough, Maine.\r\n\nSubsequently, on  May 12, 1993, FBI  investigators obtained a\r\n\nwarrant to search  the storage  unit and its  contents.   The\r\n\nensuing  search revealed  a  footlocker  containing  numerous\r\n\nincriminating items with possible connections  to the robbery\r\n\nof  the Casco  Northern  Bank.   The  footlocker belonged  to\r\n\nMcCarthy,  and  McCarthy, using  the  alias  John Perry,  had\r\n\nrented the storage unit.\r\n\nE.  Prior Proceedings\r                                 \r\n\n          Prior to  trial, Hunter moved to  suppress evidence\r\n\narising from  the Connecticut  stop and the  Alabama arrests.\r\n\nWith  respect  to  the  Connecticut stop,  Hunter  sought  to\r\n\nsuppress the statements  and gesture he made during the first\r\n\nseventy-five  minutes of  the  stop that  ultimately led  the\r\n\npolice to  James Hall.   McCarthy moved to  suppress evidence\r\n\narising from his Alabama  arrest and the searches of  the two\r\n\nsuitcases,  his pickup truck and  the Maine storage  unit.  A\r\n\nmagistrate judge  held a  two-day evidentiary hearing  on the\r\n\nmotions  and, subsequently,  issued  a  recommended  decision\r\n\ndenying  them both.   After  a de  novo review,  the district\r                                                   \r\n\ncourt denied  the motions, adopting substantially  all of the\r\n\nmagistrate judge's recommended findings.  \r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\n          At  the  ensuing trial,  McCarthy  and  Hunter were\r\n\ntried  together  before a  jury  on  a five-count  indictment\r\n\nalleging various charges arising from  a series of three bank\r\n\nrobberies  in  Connecticut, Alabama  and  Maine.5   The  jury\r\n\nfound McCarthy  and Hunter guilty of  all charges, convicting\r\n\nthe  two  men  on Count  One  of  conspiring  to commit  bank\r\n\nrobberies in  Connecticut, Alabama and Maine  in violation of\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   371, on Count Two of committing the Maine robbery\r\n\nof  the  Casco Northern  bank in  violation  of 18  U.S.C.   \r\n\n2113(a), 2113(d)  and 18 U.S.C.    2, and  on Count Three  of\r\n\nknowingly  using  and  carrying  firearms  during  the  Casco\r\n\nrobbery in  violation of 18  U.S.C.   924(c).   The jury also\r\n\nconvicted  McCarthy on  Count Four of  being an  armed career\r\n\ncriminal in  violation of 18 U.S.C.     922(g)(1), 924(e)(1),\r\n\nand Hunter  on Count Five  of being a  felon-in-possession in\r\n\nviolation of 18  U.S.C.    922(g)(1), 924(a)(2) and 18 U.S.C.\r\n\n  2.  Following trial, the district  court sentenced McCarthy\r\n\nto 387 months imprisonment.6   The court sentenced Hunter  to\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  Specifically,  Count One  of indictment  charged McCarthy\r\nand Hunter with conspiring  to rob the Franklin bank  on July\r\n6,  1992, the Peoples Bank in Woodstock, Alabama, on November\r\n13,  1992, and the Casco Northern bank in Falmouth, Maine, on\r\nApril 12, 1993.\r\n\n6.  McCarthy  was sentenced  to 327 months  on Count  Two for\r\ncommitting  the Casco  Northern  bank robbery,  to be  served\r\nconcurrently  to  a  60-month   sentence  on  Count  One  for\r\nconspiracy, and a 180-month sentence on  Count Four for being\r\nan  armed  career  criminal.    On  Count  Three,  the  court\r\nsentenced  McCarthy  to  the  mandatory  60-month consecutive\r\nsentence on the   924(c) firearm violation.\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\n270  months imprisonment  to be  served consecutively  to his\r\n\nConnecticut state sentence for violation of probation.7 \r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                          Discussion\r                                      Discussion\r                                                \r\n\n          On  appeal, Hunter challenges  the district court's\r\n\ndenial  of  his  suppression   motion,  contending  that  his\r\n\nConnecticut detention following the  Franklin robbery and his\r\n\nlater  Alabama   arrest   violated  the   Fourth   Amendment.\r\n\nSimilarly, McCarthy challenges the denial of  his suppression\r\n\nmotion,  taking issue  with the  district court's  refusal to\r\n\nfind error in his Alabama arrest and the subsequent search of\r\n\nhis  two suitcases,  pickup  truck and  storage  unit.   Both\r\n\ndefendants  also  raise  several  issues  relating  to  their\r\n\nrespective sentences.  We address each argument in turn.\r\n\nA.

In  his reply  brief,  Hunter denies  conceding that  the\r\npolice  had  sufficient  reasonable  suspicion  to  make  the\r\ninitial  stop.  To the  contrary, we think  a fair reading of\r\nhis  opening argument to this court and the arguments he made\r\nin his  briefs  to  the  district  court  below  belies  this\r\ncontention.  In  any event, the district court's finding that\r\nOfficer Richard properly acted in initially detaining  Hunter\r\nafter spotting him shortly after  the robbery, driving a  red\r\nPontiac   Sunbird,  is  eminently  supportable.    The  close\r\nproximity in both distance  and time to the Franklin  robbery\r\ncombined with the fact  that Hunter's car identically matched\r\nthe description of the vehicle the  suspects were reported to\r\nbe driving  are articulable  and specific facts  that clearly\r\ngave rise to  the reasonable suspicion needed to  justify the\r\ninitial stop.\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\noutside  time limitation  on  a permissible  Terry stop,  but\r                                                              \r\n\nholding  ninety-minute detention  of luggage  unreasonable on\r\n\nspecific  facts of case); United States v.

Indeed, whether a\r                                  \r\n\nparticular  investigatory  stop  is   too  long  turns  on  a\r\n\nconsideration of  all relevant  factors,  including \"the  law\r\n\nenforcement purposes to be served by the stop as  well as the\r\n\ntime  reasonably  needed   to  effectuate  those   purposes.\"\r\n\nSharpe,  470 U.S.  at  685.   Moreover,  a court  should  ask\r                  \r\n\n\"whether   the   police  diligently   pursued   a   means  of\r\n\ninvestigation  that was  likely  to confirm  or dispel  their\r\n\nsuspicions  quickly, during  which time  it was  necessary to\r\n\ndetain the defendant.\"  Id. at 686.  \r                                       \r\n\n          Furthermore, time of detention  cannot be the  sole\r\n\ncriteria for  measuring the  intrusiveness of  the detention.\r\n\nClearly, from the perspective of the detainee, other factors,\r\n\nincluding  the  force  used  to detain  the  individual,  the\r\n\nrestrictions placed on his or  her personal movement, and the\r\n\ninformation conveyed  to the detainee  concerning the reasons\r\n\nfor the stop and its impact on his or her  rights, affect the\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\nnature and extent of  the intrusion and, thus,  should factor\r\n\ninto the analysis.

Thus, we  limit the\r\n\nscope  of our analysis accordingly and do not address whether\r\n\nthe district  court would have  erred in failing  to suppress\r\n\nany statements or evidence obtained later in the stop.  \r\n\n          More importantly, when limited to this  time frame,\r\n\nwe  do   not  find  the   scope  of  the   stop  particularly\r\n\nunreasonable.   There is no evidence or even an allegation of\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\nless  than diligent behavior on the  part of the police.  The\r\n\nofficers on location used a number of different investigative\r\n\ntechniques in their efforts to pursue quickly any information\r\n\nthat might  have  dispelled  the  reasonable  suspicion  that\r\n\ninitially  triggered  the  stop.   Officer  Richard  ran  the\r\n\nregistration check of the  Sunbird immediately after stopping\r\n\nHunter.  Trooper  Hall promptly informed Hunter of his rights\r\n\nand questioned him about  where he had been since the time of\r\n\nthe robbery.  Other  officers brought a teller from  the bank\r\n\nto the scene in an attempt  to establish definitively whether\r\n\nor not  Hunter  had participated  in  the robbery.    Trooper\r\n\nHeller,  once on  the scene,  promptly telephoned  the rental\r\n\nagency in an effort  to learn more about the  individuals who\r\n\nhad  rented  the automobile.   In  short,  we think  that the\r\n\nrecord clearly belies any contention that the police officers\r\n\ninvolved  neglected  to   employ  any  reasonably   available\r\n\nalternative  methods that could  have significantly shortened\r\n\ntheir inquiry.  See  Quinn, 815 F.2d  at 158.  The  excessive\r                                      \r\n\nlength of  Hunter's detention arose not  because the officers\r\n\nengaged  in dilatory  tactics,  but,  instead, because  their\r\n\ninvestigative   efforts,   though   reasonable    under   the\r\n\ncircumstances, failed to dispel  the suspicion that gave rise\r\n\nto the stop.9\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n9.

Not  only  did Hunter's  incomplete  and vague\r\n\nresponses  reasonably heighten  the officers'  suspicion that\r\n\nHunter had  participated in the  robbery, they also  made the\r\n\nattempt to dispel that suspicion more difficult.

The Court then listed, with apparent approval, a variety\r\nof  different investigative techniques,  including those used\r\nhere, that  police might appropriately use  during the course\r\nof  an   investigative  stop   to  dispel   their  reasonable\r\nsuspicion.

Indeed,  several\r\n\nfactors,  specific  to  this case,  reasonably  enhanced  the\r\n\ngovernment's interest in detaining Hunter.  First, the nature\r\n\nof the  suspected criminal conduct, a  daylight armed robbery\r\n\nof a  bank involving physical  threats to both  customers and\r\n\nbank personnel, was severe.  Second, the detention took place\r\n\nshortly after the  robbery in a nearby town not  far from the\r\n\nbank.    As a  noted  commentator  has explained,  that  \"the\r\n\nsuspected  crime is  serious enough to  prompt flight  if the\r\n\nsuspect is  freed, or . .  .  recent enough  that if probable\r\n\ncause  soon develops  it  would be  desirable  to arrest  the\r\n\nsuspect  and subject  him  [or her]  to  a search\"  are  both\r\n\nlegitimate  reasons  for  continuing  custody  that  must  be\r\n\nconsidered in the total  balance.  3 Wayne R.  LaFave, Search\r                                                                         \r\n\nand Seizure    9.2(f), at  386 (2d ed.  1987).  Finally,  the\r                       \r\n\nfact  that at the  time of the  stop Hunter  was preparing to\r\n\nenter an interstate highway in  a rented vehicle bearing out-\r\n\nof-state plates weighs on the government's side of the scale.\r\n\nObjectively,  from the  perspective  of the  officers on  the\r\n\nscene,  if they  had not  detained Hunter  at that  point, he\r\n\n                             -24-\r                                          24\r\r\n\ncould  easily  have  left  the jurisdiction  and  evaded  the\r\n\ndragnet of the Connecticut State Police.\r\n\n          Finally, we  do not believe,  on the facts  of this\r\n\ncase, that  the stop was needlessly intrusive.   Although the\r\n\npolice  detained  Hunter in  the  back  of Officer  Richard's\r\n\nvehicle,  he was never handcuffed, see,  e.g., State v. Reid,\r                                                                        \r\n\n605  A.2d 1050,  1053-54  (N.H. 1992)  (placing defendant  in\r\n\ncruiser does  not make  Terry stop unreasonable);  cf.

Admittedly,\r\n\nHunter's detention following the  Franklin robbery was hardly\r\n\nwhat  one  would   normally  consider  \"brief,\"  and,   under\r\n\ncircumstances  different from  those found  here, we  have no\r\n\ndoubt that an investigative detention of similar length would\r\n\nunacceptably  offend the  Constitution.  Nonetheless,  we are\r\n\nnot  persuaded,  on the  facts  of this  case  (i.e. evidence\r                                                                \r\n\nsought  to  be  suppressed  was  obtained  during  the  first\r\n\nseventy-five  minutes of  the stop,  diligent efforts  by the\r\n\npolice  to dispel  reasonable suspicion,  defendant's evasive\r\n\nresponses  significantly  contributing to  delay, substantial\r\n\ngovernment interests in the detention, and prompt  disclosure\r\n\nto  the defendant  of  his rights  and  the reasons  for  the\r\n\n                             -26-\r                                          26\r\r\n\ndetention),  that the  district  court erred  in refusing  to\r\n\nsuppress Hunter's statements and gesture.10 \r\n\n          2.  Hunter's Alabama Arrest\r                                                 \r\n\n          Hunter also challenges  the legality of  his arrest\r\n\nin  Alabama.   Hunter  contends that,  at  the moment  of his\r\n\narrest, the arresting officer did not have probable  cause to\r\n\ntake Hunter into custody.  This challenge is without merit.\r\n\n          The district  court found that, at  the time Hunter\r\n\nwas taken  into custody, Deputy Fulmer and the other officers\r\n\ninvolved  in Hunter's  arrest  were aware  of an  outstanding\r\n\nfederal  arrest  warrant for  Hunter.    Such  a finding,  if\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n10.  Furthermore, we  also have substantial  doubt concerning\r\nthe  scope   of  the   evidence  Hunter  seeks   to  suppress\r\n(specifically,  the  testimony of  James  Hall).   Though  we\r\nquestion,  but need  not decide,  whether the  government has\r\nsufficiently  developed the  record below  to support  such a\r\nfinding, see United States v. Infante-Ruiz,  13 F.3d 498, 503\r                                                      \r\n(1st Cir.  1994) (\"[G]overnment  bears burden of  showing, by\r\nreference  to  `demonstrated  historical  facts'   and  by  a\r\npreponderance of  the evidence, that the  information or item\r\nwould inevitably have been  discovered by lawful means.\"), we\r\nthink   it  likely  that,   in  the  normal   course  of  the\r\ninvestigation,   the   government   would   have   inevitably\r\ndiscovered James Hall.   Indeed, James Hall's brother, Lance,\r\nrented  the Pontiac  Sunbird.   Trooper Heller  obtained this\r\ninformation and the fact  that Hunter was listed as  a driver\r\non  the rental  agreement solely  on the  basis of  the car's\r\nlicense plate number.   It is true that the  record lacks any\r\nevidence  clearly establishing  that  the  police would  have\r\npossessed the license plate number  absent the stop, or that,\r\nduring the normal course of the investigation, officers would\r\nhave  spoken  to Lance  Hall  and necessarily  have  made the\r\nconnection to  his brother  James.   Nonetheless,  we do  not\r\nthink  it is  unduly speculative  to infer  that such  events\r\nwould have occurred.  Had the police spoken to Lance Hall, it\r\nis  at least arguably reasonable that  he would have directed\r\nthem  to his brother James, who also knew Hunter and lived in\r\nthe vicinity of the Franklin robbery.\r\n\n                             -27-\r                                          27\r\r\n\nsupported by the record, is a sufficient basis to support the\r\n\narrest.

Fulmer's\r\n\ntestimony at the suppression  hearing, stating that, prior to\r\n\nHunter's arrest,  he knew about  the warrant and  had alerted\r\n\nthe other officers involved to this fact, amply supports  the\r\n\nfinding.   The fact that  Fulmer's report made  subsequent to\r\n\nthe  arrest fails to mention the warrant is of little moment.\r\n\nDeputy Fulmer  explained at the suppression  hearing that his\r\n\nreport  was  incomplete, and  the  district  court was  fully\r\n\nentitled to credit that testimony. \r\n\n          3.  McCarthy's Alabama Arrest\r                                                   \r\n\n          McCarthy's  challenges to  his stop  and arrest  in\r\n\nChilton  County,  Alabama, on  April  23,  1993, are  equally\r\n\nunavailing.   McCarthy contends  that no reasonable  basis or\r\n\nprobable cause existed to  stop his pickup truck as  it drove\r\n\naway from  the power station.   Moreover,  he contends  that,\r\n\neven  if the  police had  sufficient reasonable  suspicion to\r\n\n                             -28-\r                                          28\r\r\n\ndetain him briefly for investigative  purposes, the detention\r\n\nbecame an illegal de  facto arrest because he was  taken into\r                                       \r\n\ncustody and held  without probable cause until  1:00 a.m. the\r\n\nnext day when a warrant finally issued.  \r\n\n          First, we  disagree that the district court clearly\r\n\nerred in finding that Deputy Fulmer had sufficient reasonable\r\n\nsuspicion  to  have McCarthy's  truck  pulled  over.   Fulmer\r\n\ntestified that, at  the time  of the stop,  he was  generally\r\n\naware of  the details of the  ongoing Franklin investigation.\r\n\nSee  Hensley, 469  U.S.  at 229-32  (police without  specific\r                        \r\n\nknowledge  of  facts  supporting  flyer  or  bulletin  issued\r\n\nconcerning  suspects may  nonetheless  rely on  the flyer  or\r\n\nbulletin  to  supply   reasonable  suspicion  justifying   an\r\n\ninvestigatory  stop).   He stated  that he  specifically knew\r\n\nthat  McCarthy and Hunter were  suspects in a  series of bank\r\n\nrobberies,  that  the two  men  were suspected  to  be living\r\n\ntogether  in the area,  that McCarthy  was falsely  using the\r\n\nname  John E. Perry, and  that an arrest  warrant existed for\r\n\nHunter.  Moreover,  Fulmer testified  that he  knew that  the\r\n\nIsuzu truck was registered to a \"John E.  Perry,\" and that he\r\n\nbelieved  that person to be the John E. Perry under suspicion\r\n\nby  the FBI.    These facts  alone arguably  give  rise to  a\r\n\nreasonable   suspicion   sufficient   to   justify   a  brief\r\n\ninvestigatory stop of McCarthy.   More importantly, adding to\r\n\nthis  collection McCarthy's  presence at the  scene following\r\n\n                             -29-\r                                          29\r\r\n\nHunter's  flight  significantly   heightened  the   suspicion\r\n\nconcerning McCarthy's involvement.  Thus, we find no error in\r\n\nthe district court's finding.\r\n\n          Furthermore, we note  that Deputy Fulmer  testified\r\n\nthat, at the  time he ordered the stop, he did not definitely\r\n\nknow  whether McCarthy  or  Hunter was  driving the  truck or\r\n\nwhether Hunter was  a passenger.  Clearly, it was conceivable\r\n\nthat Hunter, after initially fleeing on foot,  could have run\r\n\nto,  and continued  his  escape in,  McCarthy's Isuzu  pickup\r\n\ntruck.   Thus, independent of his  suspicion about McCarthy's\r\n\ninvolvement in the  robberies, Fulmer could  justifiably have\r\n\nordered the  stop simply to  determine whether or  not Hunter\r\n\nwas inside the truck.\r\n\n          Second,  we  find  no  error in  the  finding  that\r\n\nprobable  cause  to hold  McCarthy  arose  shortly after  the\r\n\ninitial stop.   Under Alabama state law  it is an  offense to\r\n\nprovide  illegal identification  to a  police officer.   Ala.\r\n\nCode   13A-9-18.1 (\"Giving of false name or address to a  law\r\n\nenforcement officer.\"); cf. Ala.  Code   13A-9-18  (\"Criminal\r                                       \r\n\nimpersonation.\").   Fulmer testified that, at the time of the\r\n\narrest, he knew McCarthy's identification of himself as Perry\r\n\nwas false and that such identification violated Alabama state\r\n\nlaw.   Thus, once McCarthy  provided his driver's  license to\r\n\nthe trooper who stopped  him, sufficient probable cause arose\r\n\nto  take him  into custody.   We find  no clear  error in the\r\n\n                             -30-\r                                          30\r\r\n\ndistrict court's crediting this  testimony or in holding that\r\n\nit provided a sufficient basis for detaining McCarthy.\r\n\n          4.  Seizure of McCarthy's Two Suitcases\r                                                             \r\n\n          McCarthy also  challenges the  seizure  of his  two\r\n\nsuitcases.     McCarthy  contends  that  the  district  court\r\n\nerroneously found  that the seizure  of the  weapons and  the\r\n\nother items  discovered in his maroon  suitcase properly came\r\n\nwithin the \"plain view\" exception to the warrant requirement.\r\n\nHe argues that the  incriminating nature of the evidence  was\r\n\nnot  immediately apparent  to Deputy  Fulmer.   McCarthy also\r\n\ncontends that no credible  evidence established that he owned\r\n\nthe  seized weapons or that  they were actually  found in his\r\n\nsuitcase.   With  respect  to his  second suitcase,  McCarthy\r\n\nargues that the district  court erred in finding that  he had\r\n\nno expectation of privacy in the American Tourister suitcase.\r\n\nMcCarthy  maintains  that, though  he  left  the suitcase  in\r\n\nHenderson's trailer, he left it closed and locked.  Moreover,\r\n\nhe contends that he had not abandoned the suitcase because he\r\n\nintended to retrieve it  later in the evening  on the day  of\r\n\nhis arrest.  We find these arguments unpersuasive.\r\n\n          To  satisfy  the  \"plain  view\"  exception  to  the\r\n\nwarrant requirement,  the government  must show that  (1) the\r\n\nlaw enforcement  agent was legally  in a position  to observe\r\n\nthe seized evidence, and (2) the incriminating nature  of the\r\n\nevidence  was \"immediately  apparent\"  to the  officer.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -31-\r                                          31\r\r\n\nUnited  States  v. Giannetta,  909  F.2d 571,  578  (1st Cir.\r                                        \r\n\n1990).     The  incriminating  nature  of   the  evidence  is\r\n\n\"immediately apparent,\"  if the officer,  upon observing  the\r\n\nevidence,  has   probable  cause  to  believe   the  item  is\r\n\ncontraband  or  evidence  of a  crime.    Id.   \"A  practical\r                                                         \r\n\nnontechnical  probability  that  incriminating   evidence  is\r\n\ninvolved is all that is required.\"  Texas v. Brown, 460  U.S.\r                                                              \r\n\n730, 742 (1983) (quotations omitted).\r\n\n          While it  is true that the district court failed to\r\n\nmake an explicit finding on the \"immediately apparent\" prong,\r\n\nthe oversight  matters little  in the context  of this  case.\r\n\nDeputy Fulmer  knew that McCarthy,  along with Hunter,  was a\r\n\nsuspect  in  a  series  of  armed  bank  robberies.   Without\r\n\nquestion, the automatic weapons, ammunition  and bullet-proof\r\n\nvest were all potential instrumentalities of such crimes.  We\r\n\nthink a finding that the incriminating nature of the evidence\r\n\nwas immediately apparent to  Fulmer, implicit in the district\r\n\ncourt's  refusal  to suppress  the  weapons  and other  items\r\n\nseized from the suitcase, is clearly supported by the record.\r\n\n           We also find little merit in McCarthy's contention\r\n\nthat  no  credible evidence  established  that  he owned  the\r\n\nweapons  and other items seized or that they were actually in\r\n\nhis  suitcase prior  to  its being  opened.   As  an  initial\r\n\nmatter,  we   note  that   McCarthy's   contention  is   more\r\n\n                             -32-\r                                          32\r\r\n\nappropriately considered as an attack on the relevancy of the\r\n\nseized  weapons rather than a fourth amendment issue.  If, as\r\n\nMcCarthy contends, he  did not  own the weapons  and did  not\r\n\nstore them in his suitcase, then the seizure does not violate\r\n\nhis fourth amendment rights because it did not intrude on his\r\n\nprivacy.   See Sanchez, 943 F.2d  at 112-13 (Fourth Amendment\r                                  \r\n\nrights  are  personal).   On  the other  hand,  if McCarthy's\r\n\nallegation that he  did not  own or possess  the weapons  and\r\n\nother items is true,  then they would not have  been relevant\r\n\nas  evidence in  his criminal  trial.  See  Fed R.  Evid. 401\r                                                      \r\n\n(evidence is relevant  if it  tends to make  a disputed  fact\r\n\nmore  or less  probable).   When, as  here, the  relevancy of\r\n\nspecific evidence turns on a condition of fact -- whether the\r\n\nsuitcase  actually contained  the  seized  weapons and  other\r\n\nitems -- a court  shall admit it subject to  the introduction\r\n\nof evidence sufficient  to fulfill that  condition.  Fed.  R.\r\n\nEvid.  104(b); United States v. Trenkler, 61 F.3d 45, 53 (1st\r                                                    \r\n\nCir. 1995).\r\n\n          While Gene  Ellison, the person who purportedly cut\r\n\nthe  lock off  the maroon  suitcase, did  not testify  at the\r\n\nsuppression  hearing,   we  think  the   evidence  adequately\r\n\nsupports  the conclusion  that the items  seized were  in the\r\n\nsuitcase  prior to  its opening.   Henderson  testified that,\r\n\nalthough  Ellison took the padlock off  the suitcase while he\r\n\nwas  in the other room, he, not Ellison, rummaged through the\r\n\n                             -33-\r                                          33\r\r\n\nsuitcase  and found  the  weapons and  the bulletproof  vest.\r\n\nMoreover, Henderson testified that the suitcase was extremely\r\n\nheavy and that he needed Ellison's assistance to move it from\r\n\nthe back room of his trailer.  These facts reasonably support\r\n\nthe  inference that the weapons  and other items  were in the\r\n\nsuitcase   prior   to   Ellison's  removal   of   the   lock.\r\n\nFurthermore, that the items  were in the suitcase, reasonably\r\n\nsupports the inference that they belonged to McCarthy.\r\n\n          Finally,  we find  no  clear error  in the  court's\r\n\nfinding  that  McCarthy  had  no  legitimate  expectation  of\r\n\nprivacy in  the contents of the  American Tourister suitcase.\r\n\nBased   on   Henderson's   testimony,  the   district   court\r\n\nsupportably found  that McCarthy  left the  suitcase unlocked\r\n\nand open in  the back room of Henderson's trailer,  a room to\r\n\nwhich McCarthy did not have exclusive access.  Thus, McCarthy\r\n\nclearly had assumed  the risk that Henderson might consent to\r\n\na search of the room (and that the search would extend to any\r\n\nitems,  like the suitcase, sitting open in plain view).  See,\r                                                                        \r\n\ne.g., United States v.

Moreover, McCarthy's\r                        \r\n\nlegitimate expectation  argument is  further undercut  by the\r\n\nfact that he  left the open  suitcase in Henderson's  trailer\r\n\nafter  Henderson told  McCarthy  that he  and  Hunter had  to\r\n\nleave.

Sentencing Issues\r                                 \r\n\n          We now turn to the issues Hunter and McCarthy raise\r\n\nconcerning their respective sentences.  Hunter complains that\r\n\nthe  district court  unfairly  sentenced him  to a  mandatory\r\n\nfive-year   sentence  under   18   U.S.C.      924(c)   while\r\n\nsimultaneously   enhancing  his   total  offense   level  for\r\n\nbrandishing  a   firearm  during  and  in   relation  to  the\r\n\nConnecticut and Alabama robberies.  Hunter also contends that\r\n\nthe district  court erroneously  ordered  his entire  federal\r\n\nsentence  to  run  consecutively   to  his  unexpired   state\r\n\nsentence.     McCarthy  contends  that  the   district  court\r\n\nincorrectly sentenced  him as an armed  career criminal under\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   924(e).  We discuss each argument below. \r\n\n          1.

McCarthy also challenges the  search of his Isuzu pickup\r\ntruck,  arguing that it was  the fruit of  his illegal arrest\r\nand  the illegal search of  his maroon suitcase.   Because we\r\nfind  no error in either his initial  arrest or the search of\r\nthe suitcase,  we find no error  in the search of  the truck.\r\nFurthermore,   we  also  reject  McCarthy's  final  challenge\r\nconcerning the search of his storage shed in Maine because it\r\nis likewise  substantially predicated on  the assumption that\r\nthe earlier arrest and seizures were illegal.\r\n\n                             -35-\r                                          35\r\r\n\nsentencing  issues  involve questions  of law,  including the\r\n\napplicability of a relevant guideline, our review is de novo.\r                                                                        \r\n\nUnited States v.

U.S.S.G.   2K2.4(a).12   In turn,\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   924(c) specifies that any individual convicted of\r\n\nusing a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence\r\n\nor a drug trafficking crime shall be sentenced to a mandatory\r\n\nterm   of  at  least  five  years  in  prison  to  be  served\r\n\nconsecutively to  any other punishment.   18 U.S.C.   924(c).\r\n\nApplication Note 2 to U.S.S.G.   2K2.4 adds that:\r\n\n          Where  a  sentence  under  [   2K2.4]  is\r\n          imposed  in  conjunction with  a sentence\r\n          for an underlying  offense, any  specific\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n12.

Thus, where a  defendant\r\n\nreceives  a  mandatory  consecutive  sentence for  use  of  a\r\n\nfirearm during a crime  of violence, pursuant to 18  U.S.C.  \r\n\n924(c), a court  should not also enhance the defendant's base\r\n\noffense level for the underlying crime of violence to account\r\n\nfor the use of the firearm.   Id.; see also U.S.S.G.   3D1.1,\r                                                       \r\n\ncomment. (n.1).\r\n\n          In this  case,  the  district  court  treated,  for\r\n\nsentencing purposes,  the conspiracy  to commit the  Alabama,\r\n\nConnecticut and Maine  bank robberies in  Count One as  three\r\n\nseparate counts  of conspiracy  to commit the  three separate\r\n\nbank  robberies.  See U.S.S.G.   1B1.2(d) (\"A conviction on a\r                                 \r\n\ncount  charging a conspiracy to  commit more than one offense\r\n\nshall be treated as if the defendant  had been convicted on a\r\n\nseparate  count  of  conspiracy  for each  offense  that  the\r\n\ndefendant  conspired to  commit.\").   Accordingly,  the court\r\n\ncalculated a separate base  offense level for each conspiracy\r\n\nand then combined  these levels together to  produce a single\r\n\ntotal offense  level.  See U.S.S.G.   3D1.4.   In calculating\r                                      \r\n\nthe  separate base  offense  levels for  the conspiracies  to\r\n\ncommit  the  Alabama  and  the  Connecticut  robberies,   the\r\n\ndistrict  court -- in both  instances -- applied a five-level\r\n\n                             -37-\r                                          37\r\r\n\nenhancement    for   brandishing   a   firearm.      U.S.S.G.\r\n\n  2B3.1(b)(2)(C).  Because the   924(c) charge related to the\r\n\nMaine bank robbery, however, the district court did not apply\r\n\nthe brandishing enhancement when calculating the base offense\r\n\nlevel for  that conspiracy.   See U.S.S.G.    2K2.4, comment.\r                                             \r\n\n(n.2).\r\n\n          Hunter contends  that the  district court  erred in\r\n\nits calculation, contending that it should not have separated\r\n\nthe Alabama and Connecticut  robberies from the Maine robbery\r\n\nin determining whether to apply the brandishing  enhancement.\r\n\nHunter  argues that  Application Note  2  to    2K2.4 clearly\r\n\nstates  that  where the     924(c)  sentence is  imposed  \"in\r\n\nconjunction with  a sentence  for the underlying  offense\" no\r\n\nenhancement may be applied, and, in this case, the underlying\r\n\noffense was collectively the  entire conspiracy to commit the\r\n\nthree  bank  robberies.    Therefore,  Hunter concludes,  the\r\n\ndistrict  court  should  not  have  applied  the  brandishing\r\n\nenhancement  to the  conspiracies to  commit the  Alabama and\r\n\nConnecticut  robberies   because  they   were  part  of   the\r\n\n\"underlying offense.\"  We do not agree.\r\n\n          We decline  Hunter's invitation to read  the phrase\r\n\n\"the underlying  offense\" in  Application Note 2  to preclude\r\n\nthe  application  of  the  brandishing  enhancements  to  the\r\n\nconspiracies to commit the Alabama and Connecticut robberies.\r\n\nFirst,   1B1.2(d) clearly  instructs the sentencing  court to\r\n\n                             -38-\r                                          38\r\r\n\ntreat  a  count  charging  a conspiracy  to  commit  multiple\r\n\noffenses as  separate counts  of conspiracy for  each offense\r\n\nthe defendant conspired to commit.   U.S.S.G.   1B1.2(d); see\r                                                                         \r\n\nalso U.S.S.G.    3D1.2, comment.  (n.8).  Thus,  it is  clear\r                \r\n\nthat  the Sentencing  Commission does  not consider,  for the\r\n\npurposes of  applying the guidelines, a  conspiracy to commit\r\n\nmultiple  offenses  as  constituting  one  single  integrated\r\n\noffense.\r\n\n          Moreover, the  district court's application  of the\r\n\nbrandishing  enhancement does  not  undercut the  purposes of\r\n\nNote 2.   Application Note  2 is intended  to prevent  double\r\n\ncounting.   See  U.S.S.G.    2K2.4,  comment. (backg'd)  (\"To\r                           \r\n\navoid double counting, when a sentence under this section  is\r\n\nimposed  in conjunction  with  a sentence  for an  underlying\r\n\noffense, any specific offense characteristic for explosive or\r\n\nfirearm  discharge,  use, or  possession  is  not applied  in\r\n\nrespect to  such  underlying offense.\").   In  this case,  no\r\n\ndouble counting occurred.  Hunter's conviction under   924(c)\r\n\nwas  for using or carrying the firearm during and in relation\r\n\nto  the  Maine  robbery,  and the  district  court  carefully\r\n\neschewed   applying   the   brandishing    enhancement   when\r\n\ncalculating  the  offense level  for  Hunter's  conspiracy to\r\n\ncommit  that  offense.   The  court  applied the  brandishing\r\n\nenhancement only when calculating the offense levels relating\r\n\nto the  Alabama and  Connecticut robberies.   Thus, the  same\r\n\n                             -39-\r                                          39\r\r\n\nconduct  did  not unfairly  give  rise to  both  a sentencing\r\n\nenhancement and a separate mandatory sentence under 18 U.S.C.\r\n\n  924(c).\r\n\n               b.  Consecutive or Concurrent Sentences\r                                                                  \r\n\n          In 1988,  Hunter pled  guilty in Connecticut  state\r\n\ncourt to possession  of cocaine with  intent to  sell.  As  a\r\n\nresult, he  was sentenced  to a term  of ten  years in  state\r\n\nprison.  After serving three  years, the balance of  Hunter's\r\n\nsentence  was suspended  and he  was released on  three years\r\n\nprobation.   Hunter was still on probation at the time of the\r\n\nFranklin   robbery.    Shortly  after  the  Franklin  robbery\r\n\noccurred,  an  order  charging   Hunter  with  violation   of\r\n\nprobation was issued, and,  ultimately, on November 16, 1993,\r\n\na  Connecticut state  court  revoked  Hunter's probation  and\r\n\nsentenced  him to  seven-years  imprisonment (apparently  the\r\n\nunexpired portion  of  his suspended  ten-year  sentence  for\r\n\ncocaine possession).  At the time of sentencing in this case,\r\n\nHunter was  serving the  remainder of his  Connecticut prison\r\n\nterm.\r\n\n          At Hunter's federal sentencing, the  district court\r\n\nruled   that  his   entire   federal   sentence  should   run\r\n\nconsecutively to his state sentence.  In so ruling, the court\r\n\nrelied on U.S.S.G.   5G1.3(c), which provides that \r\n\n          the  sentence  for  the  instant  offense\r\n          shall be imposed to run  consecutively to\r\n          the    prior    undischarged   term    of\r\n          imprisonment to the  extent necessary  to\r\n\n                             -40-\r                                          40\r\r\n\n          achieve    a    reasonable    incremental\r\n          punishment for the instant offense.13\r\n\nThe court  effectively held that, because  the state sentence\r\n\nstemmed not just from the underlying cocaine offense but also\r\n\nfrom the separate  probation violation, the federal  sentence\r\n\nshould run consecutively  to the state  sentence in order  to\r\n\ninsure the necessary incremental punishment.    \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n13.  The   district  court   correctly  ruled   that  neither\r\n  5G1.3(a) or (b) governed  Hunter's sentencing.  In relevant\r\npart, U.S.S.G.   5G1.3 provides:\r\n             5G1.3 Imposition  of a  Sentence on  a Defendant\r                                                                         \r\n          Subject to an Undischarged Term of Imprisonment\r                                                                     \r\n\n          (a) If the  instant offense was committed\r\n          while the defendant was serving a term of\r\n          imprisonment  (including  work   release,\r\n          furlough,  or  escape  status)  or  after\r\n          sentencing  for,  but  before  commencing\r\n          service  of,  such term  of imprisonment,\r\n          the  sentence  for  the  instant  offense\r\n          shall be imposed to run  consecutively to\r\n          the undischarged term of imprisonment.\r\n\n          (b) If subsection (a) does not apply, and\r\n          the  undischarged  term  of  imprisonment\r\n          resulted from offense(s)  that have  been\r\n          fully   taken   into   account   in   the\r\n          determination  of  the offense  level for\r\n          the instant offense, the sentence for the\r\n          instant  offense shall be  imposed to run\r\n          concurrently to the undischarged  term of\r\n          imprisonment.\r\n\n          (c) (Policy Statement) In any other case,\r\n          the  sentence  for  the  instant  offense\r\n          shall be imposed to run  consecutively to\r\n          the    prior    undischarged   term    of\r\n          imprisonment to the  extent necessary  to\r\n          achieve    a    reasonable    incremental\r\n          punishment for the instant offense.\r\n\n                             -41-\r                                          41\r\r\n\n          On   appeal,  Hunter  contends  that,  in  applying\r\n\nsubsection (c) and sentencing  Hunter to a wholly consecutive\r\n\nfederal sentence, the district  court erred because it failed\r\n\nto  follow the  method outlined  in Application  Note 3  to  \r\n\n5G1.3 for calculating the appropriate incremental punishment.\r\n\nNote 3 provides that: \r\n\n          [t]o  the  extent practicable,  the court\r\n          should consider  a reasonable incremental\r\n          penalty to be a sentence  for the instant\r\n          offense  that  results   in  a   combined\r                                                               \r\n          sentence     of     imprisonment     that\r                                                               \r\n          approximates  the  total punishment  that\r                                                               \r\n          would  have  been  imposed  under   5G1.2\r                                                               \r\n          (Sentencing   on   Multiple   Counts   of\r\n          Conviction) had all of the  offenses been\r                                                               \r\n          federal offenses for which sentences were\r                                      \r\n          being imposed at the same time.\r\n\nU.S.S.G.    5G1.3, comment.

Thus, Hunter  contends that, before\r\n\nsentencing him to a wholly consecutive sentence, the district\r\n\ncourt  should  have calculated  the  sentence  he would  have\r\n\nreceived if the revocation of  probation and the instant bank\r\n\nrobbery offenses  had all been federal offenses  for which he\r\n\nwas sentenced at the same time.  We disagree.\r\n\n          First, as noted,   5G1.3(c) instructs the  district\r\n\ncourt,  in cases where it  applies, to sentence defendants to\r\n\n                             -42-\r                                          42\r\r\n\nconsecutive sentences  \"to the extent necessary  to achieve a\r\n\nreasonable incremental punishment.\"  Then, Application Note 3\r\n\nprescribes   a  method   for   calculating  the   \"reasonable\r\n\nincremental punishment\" that we have recognized applies in \"a\r\n\ngood many of the cases likely to arise under subsection (c).\"\r\n\nUnited  States v.  Gondek,  65 F.3d  1,  3 (1st  Cir.  1995).\r                                     \r\n\nImplicit  in this  recognition,  however, is  the fact  that,\r\n\nalthough the method applies  in a \"good many cases,\"  it does\r\n\nnot cover every case.   Indeed, as Application Note  3 itself\r\n\nexplains, the methodology it  prescribes is intended only \"to\r\n\nassist  the court  in determining the  appropriate sentence.\"\r\n\nU.S.S.G.    5G1.3, comment.  (n.3); cf. id.  (cautioning that\r                                                       \r\n\nmethod   should   be   followed   only   \"[t]o   the   extent\r\n\npracticable\").    Therefore,  while  it  is  evident  that  a\r\n\nsentencing court should initially look to Note 3 for guidance\r\n\nin  calculating an  appropriate  incremental  punishment,  it\r\n\nnonetheless has discretion to follow a different  course in a\r\n\nsmall  number of  cases where  adherence to  Note 3  would be\r\n\nimpracticable  and result  in  an  inappropriate  incremental\r\n\npunishment.   See, e.g.,  United States v.  Brassell, 49 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n274, 278 (7th Cir. 1995) (court has discretion in appropriate\r\n\ncircumstances to disregard  methodology outlined in Note  3),\r\n\nUnited States v. Torrez 40 F.3d 84, 87 (5th Cir. 1994)(same).\r                                   \r\n\n          In this  case, the district  court did  not err  by\r\n\nfollowing  a different course.   First, it is  far from clear\r\n\n                             -43-\r                                          43\r\r\n\nhow, and if, Application Note 3 applies to the  facts of this\r\n\ncase.   None of the four detailed examples outlined in Note 3\r\n\nexplain how to sentence a defendant who is serving out a term\r\n\nfollowing the revocation of probation.  See U.S.S.G.   5G1.3,\r                                                       \r\n\ncomment.  (n.3).  Moreover, the text of Note 3 instructs that\r\n\nthe incremental punishment should  be calculated according to\r\n\nthe grouping rules set forth in   5G1.2.  Section 5G1.2  (and\r\n\nthe  other sections to  which it  refers), however,  does not\r\n\ndiscuss  how  to  handle  a  sentenced  imposed  following  a\r\n\nprobation revocation.   The guidelines  do discuss  sentences\r\n\nimposed  for probation  violations separately  under U.S.S.G.\r\n\nCh. 7.  Significantly, Application Note 5 to U.S.S.G.   7B1.3\r\n\ninstructs that \r\n\n          it  is  the  Commission's  recommendation\r\n          that any sentence  of imprisonment for  a\r\n          criminal  offense  that is  imposed after\r\n          revocation  of  probation  or  supervised\r\n          released be run consecutively to any term\r                                                               \r\n          of imprisonment imposed upon revocation.\r                                     \r\n\nU.S.S.G.     7B1.3,  comment.  (n.5) (emphasis  added).    If\r\n\nanything, Note  5 suggests  that the  course followed  by the\r\n\ndistrict  court, imposing a  wholly consecutive sentence, was\r\n\ncorrect.    See Torrez,  40  F.3d  at  87-88  (Section  7B1.3\r                                  \r\n\nsuggests that -- as in this case -- notwithstanding Note 3 to\r\n\n  5G1.3,  imposition of wholly consecutive  sentence would be\r\n\nappropriate in case involving a probation revocation).\r\n\n          Furthermore,  Application Note  3 fails  to explain\r\n\nwhether,  in a  situation like  the present,  a court  should\r\n\n                             -44-\r                                          44\r\r\n\nconsider the underlying state drug  conviction in calculating\r\n\nthe  equivalent federal  sentence.   In his  argument, Hunter\r\n\nignores the underlying drug possession and contends that Note\r\n\n3 requires  the court to combine only  the guideline sentence\r\n\nfor federal  probation revocation with the guideline sentence\r\n\nfor  the instant  bank  robbery charges.   Such  an approach,\r\n\nhowever, fails to  account for the  fact that, in  sentencing\r\n\nHunter  to the  unexpired portion  of his  suspended ten-year\r\n\ndrug  sentence,  the state  court  arguably  aimed to  punish\r\n\nHunter for  both the  probation violation and  the underlying\r\n\ncocaine  possession.   Cf. United  States v.  Gullickson, 981\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d  344,  346-47  (8th Cir.  1992)  (instructing sentencing\r\n\ncourt  to calculate  appropriate  incremental  punishment  by\r\n\nestimating equivalent federal sentence  for state forgery and\r\n\nother  offenses  and combining  that  with  the sentence  for\r\n\ninstant  federal  offense where  defendant,  at  the time  of\r\n\nsentencing,  was   serving   state  prison   term   following\r\n\nrevocation of probation imposed for state forgery conviction;\r\n\ncourt notably  did not instruct sentencing  court to estimate\r\n\nfederal penalty for probation violation).\r\n\n          Finally, we  note that Hunter's case  is unlike the\r\n\nusual situation governed by   5G1.3(c), in which the offenses\r\n\nsupporting the separate sentences arise from related conduct.\r\n\nSee Gondek, 65 F.3d at 3.   In such cases (e.g., a state drug\r                                                           \r\n\ncharge and  a related  federal  firearms charge),  sentencing\r\n\n                             -45-\r                                          45\r\r\n\naccording to  the grouping rules as  suggested by Application\r\n\nNote 3  makes much sense.   In other words,  when the federal\r\n\nsentence arises from conduct or acts directly related to that\r\n\non which  the state  sentence  is based,  application of  the\r\n\nguidelines'  grouping rules accords  with fairness principles\r\n\ninherent in the guidelines by \"limit[ing] the significance of\r\n\nthe formal charging  decision and . . . prevent[ing] multiple\r\n\npunishment  for  substantially  identical  offense  conduct.\"\r\n\nU.S.S.G. Ch.3  Pt.D,  intro. comment.    Hunter's  situation,\r\n\nhowever, is different.   The federal bank robbery convictions\r\n\narise  from  conduct  completely  unrelated  to  the  cocaine\r\n\npossession that lies at the heart of the state  sentence.  In\r\n\ncases like Hunter's, where the acts or conduct giving rise to\r\n\nthe  different   sentences  are  not  closely   related,  the\r\n\nrationale of  the guidelines' grouping rules  does not apply.\r\n\nIndeed, Hunter's situation  is more \"closely akin to the case\r\n\nof the defendant  who commits  a new offense  while still  in\r\n\nprison,  the very  situation in  which [U.S.S.G.    5G1.3(a)]\r\n\ninstructs   that   the  new   sentence   is   to  be   served\r\n\nconsecutively.\"  Gondek, 65 F.3d at 3.  \r                                   \r\n\n          Accordingly, we do not  believe that the method for\r\n\ncalculating a \"reasonable incremental  punishment\" prescribed\r\n\nin  Application Note 3  clearly addresses Hunter's situation.\r\n\nIn  short, it would not  have been \"practicable\"  in light of\r\n\nthe inconsistencies outlined above  for the district court to\r\n\n                             -46-\r                                          46\r\r\n\nhave attempted to follow Note 3, and, thus, it did not err in\r\n\nfailing to  do so.    Moreover, we  do  not think  the  court\r\n\notherwise  abused its  discretion in  sentencing Hunter  to a\r\n\nwholly consecutive  federal sentence.    The court  carefully\r\n\nconsidered the circumstances of this case and determined that\r\n\nsuch a sentence was necessary in order to insure a reasonable\r\n\nincremental punishment for the federal bank robbery charges.\r\n\n          Furthermore, we believe the Sentencing Commission's\r\n\nadoption  in 1993 of Application  Note 4 to  U.S.S.G.   5G1.3\r\n\nimplicitly  supports  this  conclusion.   In  cases  where  a\r\n\ndefendant has committed a federal offense while on probation,\r\n\nNote  4 expressly  limits  a district  court's discretion  in\r\n\ndetermining  a reasonable incremental punishment by providing\r\n\nthat  the court must order the entire federal sentence to run\r\n\nconsecutively  to  any sentence  imposed  upon  revocation of\r\n\nprobation.     See  U.S.S.G.      5G1.3,   comment.  (n.4).14\r                              \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n14.  In  order  to  avoid  any ex  post  facto  concerns, the\r                                                          \r\ndistrict court expressly declined to rely on Application Note\r\n4, enacted  November 1, 1993  (prior to sentencing  but after\r\nthe underlying criminal acts), which provides:\r\n\n          4.   If the  defendant was on  federal or\r\n          state  probation,  parole, or  supervised\r\n          release   at  the  time  of  the  instant\r\n          offense,  and  has  had  such  probation,\r\n          parole,  or  supervised release  revoked,\r\n          the  sentence  for  the  instant  offense\r\n          should   be   imposed   to    be   served\r\n          consecutively to the term imposed for the\r\n          violation  of    probation,   parole,  or\r\n          supervised release in order to provide an\r\n          incremental penalty for the  violation of\r\n          probation, parole,  or supervised release\r\n\n                             -47-\r                                          47\r\r\n\nSignificantly, the  Sentencing Commission  added Note 4  to  \r\n\n5G1.3 without altering in any way the language of Application\r\n\nNote  3.    Thus,  in doing  so,  the  Commission  implicitly\r\n\nrecognized  that,  prior  to  the  adoption  of  Note  4,   a\r\n\nsentencing  court at  the very  least had  the discretion  in\r\n\ncases  like Hunter's  (e.g., probation  revocation cases)  to\r                                       \r\n\nignore the methodology set forth in Note 3 and order a wholly\r\n\nconsecutive sentence.\r\n\n          3.  McCarthy's Sentencing Issue\r                                                     \r\n\n          Finally, McCarthy challenges  the district  court's\r\n\nuse of his seven  prior state attempted-murder convictions as\r\n\na  single predicate  offense  in determining  whether he  was\r\n\nsubject to sentencing  as an armed  career criminal under  18\r\n\nU.S.C.  924(e).   McCarthy contends  that the  district court\r\n\nshould not  have considered the  attempted-murder convictions\r\n\nbecause they arose out of the same incident that gave rise to\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n          (in accord  with the policy  expressed in\r\n            7B1.3 and 7B1.4).\r\n\nU.S.S.G.      5G1.3,  comment.  (n.4).     We  also  find  it\r\nunnecessary to rely  on Note  4, and, thus,  do not  consider\r\nwhether it poses any significant ex post facto concerns.\r                                                          \r\n\n                             -48-\r                                          48\r\r\n\na  \"non-qualifying\" bank  larceny  conviction.15   We do  not\r\n\nagree. \r\n\n          As  the government  explains, the  sentencing court\r\n\ndid not count the larceny conviction as a separate  predicate\r\n\noffense, but  instead counted only the state attempted-murder\r\n\nconvictions (and  the court counted  those only  as a  single\r\n\npredicate  offense).    Thus,  the  district  court  did  not\r\n\nconsider an arguably non-qualifying predicate  offense (i.e.,\r\n\nthe bank larceny conviction) in determining whether it should\r\n\nsentence McCarthy  as an  armed career criminal.   McCarthy's\r\n\nimplicit contention  that, whenever  the  same conduct  gives\r\n\nrise  to both  qualifying and  non-qualifying  convictions, a\r\n\nsentencing court may consider  neither in determining whether\r\n\ndefendant qualifies as an armed career criminal is completely\r\n\nwithout logic or support.   Accordingly, McCarthy's complaint\r\n\nlacks merit.\r\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r                                             \r\n\n                          Conclusion\r                                      Conclusion\r                                                \r\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.\r                                                    affirm\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n15.  18  U.S.C.     924(e)  provides,  inter  alia,  that  an\r                                                              \r\nindividual shall be sentenced as an armed  career criminal if\r\nhe  or  she  has  violated  18  U.S.C.     922(g)   (unlawful\r\npossession of  a firearm) and has  three previous convictions\r\nby  any court for a  violent felony, serious  drug offense or\r\nboth, committed on occasions different from  one another.  In\r\nthis case,  the district  court held that  McCarthy's federal\r\nbank  larceny conviction did not qualify as a violent felony.\r\nWe have no need to review that decision.\r\n\n                             -49-\r                                          49\r\r\n",

See, e.g., United States v. Sealey, 30 F.3d 7, 8 (1st Cir.1994).   Where specific findings are lacking, we view the record in the light most favorable to the ruling, making all reasonably supported inferences.   See United States v. Kimball, 25 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1994);  United States v. Sanchez, 943 F.2d 110, 112 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Hunter's Connecticut Detention</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 6, 1992, around 1:45 p.m., two men robbed a bank in Franklin, Connecticut.   Each man wore a plastic, Halloween-type mask, covering his entire face, and each was armed, one with a pump-action shotgun and the other with a semi-automatic pistol.   The man carrying the shotgun stood in the bank's lobby, issuing commands, while the other vaulted the teller's counter and collected the money.   They fled the bank in a light-blue GMC Jimmy truck.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A short time later, the Connecticut State Police located the truck, abandoned in an industrial park less than a mile from the bank.   Witnesses reported that a red Pontiac Sunbird bearing Rhode Island license plates recently had been parked near the spot where the abandoned GMC Jimmy was found.   Subsequently, the police issued an updated radio bulletin, indicating that the two suspects were now believed to be travelling in the red Pontiac Sunbird.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About 2:30 p.m., Officer Arthur Richard of the Norwich Police Department spotted a red Pontiac Sunbird bearing Rhode Island license plates at a gas station, not far from Franklin.   Officer Richard reported the sighting, and, after the car left the station, stopped the vehicle as it prepared to enter an interstate highway.   Officer Richard ordered the driver out of the Sunbird, patted him down for weapons and directed him to take a seat in the back of his police cruiser.   The police cruiser's internal rear door handles were not functional and a plastic spit guard and a wire cage separated its rear and front seats.   Officer Richard did not handcuff the driver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to Officer Richard's questioning, the driver identified himself as Hunter.   Officer Richard ran a registration check on the Sunbird and learned that it was registered to a rental agency at a Rhode Island airport.   Hunter told Richard that a friend had rented the automobile for him because his own car was under repair.   Hunter, however, refused to identify the friend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within minutes, several other police officers, including Connecticut State Troopers Jerry Hall and Louis Heller, arrived on the scene.   Trooper Hall spoke to Hunter through the open rear door of Richard's cruiser and detected alcohol on Hunter's breath.   Hunter admitted drinking a few beers with a friend, but declined to identify the friend.   At Hall's request, Hunter took a field sobriety test, which he passed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About 2:43 p.m., Trooper Hall advised Hunter of his Miranda rights and informed him that, although he was not under arrest, he was being detained for investigative purposes.   Hunter stated that he understood his rights and waived them, but nonetheless declined to say where he had been since 1:00 p.m., stating only that he had been with a \"Born-Again-Christian\" friend.   At some point, Trooper Hall explained that the officers were detaining him because his Pontiac Sunbird matched identically the description of a vehicle involved in a bank robbery that had occurred earlier that day.   Trooper Hall continued to question Hunter intermittently for about forty-five minutes.   During that time, other officers drove a teller from the bank by the cruiser in an unsuccessful attempt to identify Hunter as one of the robbers.   In addition, Trooper Hall took three Polaroid photographs of Hunter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, Trooper Heller learned that the agency registered as the owner of the Pontiac Sunbird had rented the vehicle to Lance Hall, a black male, who had listed Hunter, who is white, on the rental agreement as a co-driver.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  After receiving this information, Heller went to a nearby bar and questioned patrons in an attempt to determine whether Hunter and another individual had stopped there earlier.   Upon returning to the police cruiser in which Hunter was still being detained, Trooper Heller asked Hunter where he had been prior to the stop.   Hunter replied that he had not been anywhere near Franklin, but instead had spent the day at a friend's place in the woods.   Hunter, however, claimed not to remember his friend's name nor where the place was located.   On the basis of the information he had obtained from the rental car agency, Trooper Heller then asked Hunter if his friend was black.   With this question, Hunter became agitated, swore at Heller, and, while gesturing in one general direction, told him to find out for himself.   This occurred about 3:45 p.m., approximately seventy-five minutes after Officer Richard initially stopped Hunter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trooper Heller knew the area well and could think of only one black male living in the general direction in which Hunter had gestured.   Consequently, Trooper Heller drove to that person's house and inquired whether Hunter had visited earlier that day.   The black male living at the house identified himself as James Hall and stated that Hunter had been there with another man named John.   According to James Hall, Hunter and John had borrowed James Hall's truck earlier in the day and had later returned to Hall's house to change their clothes.   After interviewing James Hall, Heller returned to where Hunter was being detained and, at 4:43 p.m., Hunter was released.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Ensuing Investigation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following his release, Hunter remained the focus of the Franklin robbery investigation.   The investigation involved a cooperative effort between the Connecticut State Police, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\"), and, ultimately, law enforcement officials in Alabama and Maine.   During the course of the investigation, James Hall<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> revealed to investigators that Hunter's friend \"John\" had recently replaced his Alabama driver's license with a Connecticut license in the name of John E. Perry.   Investigators subsequently learned that the real John E. Perry had lost his Alabama license prior to the Franklin bank robbery and that McCarthy had used the alias John Perry in Florida following an arrest there.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The real John E. Perry, who lived in Alabama, identified McCarthy as James Hardiman, an individual who had been involved with his former wife.   Investigators also learned that, in 1991, Hunter and McCarthy had spent time together as cellmates in a Connecticut state prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the investigation progressed, Connecticut authorities apprised FBI agents in Alabama, who were investigating a series of similar Alabama bank robberies, of the events surrounding the Franklin robbery.   Accordingly, McCarthy and Hunter became suspects in the Alabama robberies.   In early 1993, Alabama FBI Agent Marshall Ridlehoover learned that McCarthy and Hunter might be living in Chilton County, Alabama.   Agent Ridlehoover alerted the Chilton County Sheriff's Department that the two men were suspects in a series of bank robberies in Alabama and Connecticut and sent the department photographs of McCarthy and Hunter.   Initially, Ridlehoover told the Chilton County Sheriff's Department that the FBI wanted to have the two men kept under surveillance.   Subsequently, Ridlehoover informed the Sheriff's Department that a federal arrest warrant for unlawful flight from prosecution had been issued for Hunter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Alabama Arrests of Hunter and McCarthy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While driving to work on the morning of April 23, 1993, Deputy Wayne Fulmer, assistant chief deputy of the Chilton County Sheriff's Department, noticed a pickup truck bearing Maine license plates.   Because the presence of Maine plates in Chilton County struck Fulmer as rather unusual, he ran a registration check on the truck and discovered that the truck was registered to a John E. Perry.   Fulmer knew at this time that FBI investigators were looking for an individual using the alias John E. Perry in connection with a series of bank robberies in Connecticut and Alabama.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that morning, a woman at the local power company, who had been shown a photograph of Hunter, reported that a person resembling Hunter had requested that power be turned on at his trailer.   After receiving this report, Fulmer brought a copy of Hunter's photograph to the woman and asked her to notify the Sheriff's Department if the man returned.   A short time later that day, the woman reported that Hunter had returned.   Upon learning this, Fulmer left for the power company and requested several back-up units to meet him there.   On the way, Fulmer alerted by radio the other officers responding to the scene that an outstanding federal warrant existed for Hunter's arrest.   The first officer to arrive at the power company identified himself to Hunter and asked to speak to him.   In response, Hunter turned and ran.   The officer radioed that the suspect was fleeing on foot and then gave chase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several officers eventually caught and arrested Hunter.   A search incident to the arrest disclosed an envelope containing $6039 in cash on Hunter's person.   Over two weeks later, on May 11, 1993, Agent Ridlehoover matched the serial numbers of twenty bills taken from the envelope to bills stolen from the Casco Northern Bank in Falmouth, Maine, on April 12, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Hunter was fleeing on foot, Deputy Fulmer, who had yet to reach the power company, spotted the same pickup truck, which he had seen earlier in the day, heading away from the power company.   Fulmer directed an Alabama state trooper who was following him to turn around and stop the truck.   At this point, Fulmer did not know the identity of either the person driving the truck or the person who had fled on foot.   After stopping the truck, the state trooper asked the driver for identification.   The driver of the truck, McCarthy, falsely identified himself as John E. Perry and gave the trooper a Maine driver's license bearing that name.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently about 12:15 p.m., McCarthy was taken into custody and transported to the Chilton County Courthouse.   McCarthy was searched and approximately $2000 in cash was found on his person.   Shortly after stopping McCarthy, an official from the Chilton County Sheriff's Department notified Connecticut officials that McCarthy was in custody.   The Connecticut officials requested that the Chilton County Sheriff's Department continue to hold McCarthy while they attempted to secure an arrest warrant based on McCarthy's alleged participation in the Franklin robbery.   Sometime after midnight, a Connecticut Superior Judge signed an arrest warrant for McCarthy for his participation in the Franklin robbery.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>D. Search and Seizure of McCarthy's Suitcases, Truck and Storage Unit</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the evening of April 23, 1993, the day of McCarthy's arrest in Alabama, Deputy Fulmer received a telephone call from Chilton County resident Gene Ellison.   Ellison told Fulmer that McCarthy and Hunter had been staying with his neighbor, Joe Henderson, and that McCarthy and Hunter had left some items in Henderson's trailer that Fulmer should see.   Deputy Fulmer agreed to come by Henderson's trailer.   When he arrived, Fulmer found a maroon suitcase laying open on Henderson's kitchen table.   An AK-47 assault rifle, a pistol, extra clips and a bullet-proof vest sat atop the suitcase in plain view.   Henderson told Fulmer that the suitcase and its contents belonged to McCarthy and asked him to take possession of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henderson further explained that he had permitted McCarthy and Hunter to stay with him for the past six days in return for $40 rent.   Henderson knew McCarthy and Hunter because the two men had previously rented a trailer from Henderson's landlord, J.B. Ellison.   While staying with Henderson, McCarthy and Hunter had slept on a couch and an easy chair in Henderson's living room and had kept their belongings in a back bedroom that Henderson used for storage.   On Thursday, April 22, the day before the arrests, Henderson had told the two men that he was expecting company for the upcoming weekend and that they would have to leave.   When Henderson left for work on the morning of the arrests, McCarthy and Hunter were preparing to move out of the trailer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Henderson returned home that afternoon, Gene Ellison told him that the police had arrested McCarthy and Hunter.   Henderson then decided to check his trailer to see if McCarthy and Hunter had left anything behind.   In the storage room, he found two suitcases, the maroon suitcase that was closed and locked, and an American Tourister suitcase that was laying open with clothes piled on top of it.   Henderson attempted to move the maroon suitcase out of the room to a storage shed behind his trailer but was unable to do so because the suitcase was too heavy.   He asked Gene Ellison to help him.   Ellison moved the suitcase into the other room and cut the lock off of it in order to find out why it weighed so much.   After Ellison cut off the lock, Henderson opened the suitcase and discovered the weapons, the bullet-proof vest and other items.   Some time later, Henderson decided he should turn the suitcase and its contents over to the police so he asked Ellison to call the sheriff's department.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During Deputy Fulmer's visit on the evening of April 23, Henderson failed to tell him about the additional American Tourister suitcase Henderson had discovered.   Several days later, however, Henderson told an FBI agent about it during an interview.   Later, at Henderson's request, Fulmer and FBI agent Rich Schott took possession of the suitcase.   Agent Ridlehoover inventoried the American Tourister on May 1, 1993, pursuant to standard FBI practice.   No warrant was obtained for the suitcase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following McCarthy's Alabama arrest, a warrant was obtained on April 28, 1993, to search his pickup truck.   Accordingly, investigators searched the truck, finding a receipt for a storage unit located in Scarborough, Maine.   Subsequently, on May 12, 1993, FBI investigators obtained a warrant to search the storage unit and its contents.   The ensuing search revealed a footlocker containing numerous incriminating items with possible connections to the robbery of the Casco Northern Bank.   The footlocker belonged to McCarthy, and McCarthy, using the alias John Perry, had rented the storage unit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>E. Prior Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to trial, Hunter moved to suppress evidence arising from the Connecticut stop and the Alabama arrests.   With respect to the Connecticut stop, Hunter sought to suppress the statements and gesture he made during the first seventy-five minutes of the stop that ultimately led the police to James Hall.   McCarthy moved to suppress evidence arising from his Alabama arrest and the searches of the two suitcases, his pickup truck and the Maine storage unit.   A magistrate judge held a two-day evidentiary hearing on the motions and, subsequently, issued a recommended decision denying them both.   After a de novo review, the district court denied the motions, adopting substantially all of the magistrate judge's recommended findings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the ensuing trial, McCarthy and Hunter were tried together before a jury on a five-count indictment alleging various charges arising from a series of three bank robberies in Connecticut, Alabama and Maine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The jury found McCarthy and Hunter guilty of all charges, convicting the two men on Count One of conspiring to commit bank robberies in Connecticut, Alabama and Maine in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371, on Count Two of committing the Maine robbery of the Casco Northern bank in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2113(a), 2113(d) and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2, and on Count Three of knowingly using and carrying firearms during the Casco robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c).   The jury also convicted McCarthy on Count Four of being an armed career criminal in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 922(g)(1), 924(e)(1), and Hunter on Count Five of being a felon-in-possession in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 922(g)(1), 924(a)(2) and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2.   Following trial, the district court sentenced McCarthy to 387 months imprisonment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The court sentenced Hunter to 270 months imprisonment to be served consecutively to his Connecticut state sentence for violation of probation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Hunter challenges the district court's denial of his suppression motion, contending that his Connecticut detention following the Franklin robbery and his later Alabama arrest violated the Fourth Amendment.   Similarly, McCarthy challenges the denial of his suppression motion, taking issue with the district court's refusal to find error in his Alabama arrest and the subsequent search of his two suitcases, pickup truck and storage unit.   Both defendants also raise several issues relating to their respective sentences.   We address each argument in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. The Suppression Motions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of a district court's decision to grant or deny a suppression motion is plenary.  United States v. DeMasi, 40 F.3d 1306, 1311 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 947, 130 L.Ed.2d 890 (1995).  \"We defer, however, to a district court's factual findings if, on a reasonable view of the evidence, they are not clearly erroneous.\"  Id.;  see also United States v. Zapata, 18 F.3d 971, 975 (1st Cir.1994).   A clear error exists only if, after considering all the evidence, we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.  United States v. McLaughlin, 957 F.2d 12, 17 (1st Cir.1992).   Moreover, we will uphold a district court's decision to deny a suppression motion provided that any reasonable view of the evidence supports the decision.  United States v. Garcia, 983 F.2d 1160, 1167 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Hunter's Connecticut Detention</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hunter initially challenges the legality of the Connecticut stop.   Hunter contends that the stop constituted a de facto arrest unsupported by probable cause, and, therefore, the comments and gesture he made during the first seventy-five minutes of the stop--leading eventually to the discovery of James Hall--should have been suppressed.   Furthermore, Hunter contends that the testimony of James Hall should have been suppressed as the fruit of an illegal arrest.   We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fourth Amendment does not demand that probable cause exist prior to all police action.   See generally Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).   Indeed, it is well-settled that, based merely on a reasonable and articulable suspicion, a police officer may make a brief stop or \"seizure\" of an individual to investigate suspected past or present criminal activity.   See United States v. Hensley, 469 U.S. 221, 226-229, 105 S.Ct. 675, 678-81, 83 L.Ed.2d 604 (1985) (extending Terry stops to past criminal conduct);  United States v. Quinn, 815 F.2d 153, 156 (1st Cir.1987).   The relevant question in these cases is not whether the police had probable cause to act, but instead whether the actions taken were reasonable under the circumstances.   See United States v. Sharpe, 470 U.S. 675, 682, 105 S.Ct. 1568, 1573, 84 L.Ed.2d 605 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining whether a challenged action is reasonable, and, thus, falls within the range of permissible investigatory stops or detentions, a court should engage a two-step inquiry, asking (1) whether the officer's action was justified at its inception;  and (2) whether the action taken was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances justifying the interference in the first place.  Terry, 392 U.S. at 19-20, 88 S.Ct. at 1878-79;  United States v. Stanley, 915 F.2d 54, 55 (1st Cir.1990).   Moreover, the Supreme Court has explained that, in such circumstances, the question of reasonableness requires a court to \"balance[ ] the nature and quality of the intrusion on personal security against the importance of the governmental interests alleged to justify the intrusion.\"  Hensley, 469 U.S. at 228, 105 S.Ct. at 680 (emphasis added).   The inquiry is fact specific and a court should consider the totality of the circumstances confronting the police at the time of the stop.  Kimball, 25 F.3d at 6;  see also United States v. Rodriguez-Morales, 929 F.2d 780, 783 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1030, 112 S.Ct. 868, 116 L.Ed.2d 774 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, we note that Hunter essentially concedes that Officer Richard had sufficient reasonable suspicion to make the initial stop.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Hunter's principal complaint, instead, focuses on the second step of the inquiry, arguing that the length of his detention was simply too long.   He contends that the length of the Connecticut stop exceeded the permissible durational limits of an investigative stop not supported by probable cause, and, thus, made the entire scope of police conduct unreasonable per se.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have noted before, however, \" 'there is no talismanic time beyond which any stop initially justified on the basis of Terry becomes an unreasonable seizure under the [F]ourth [A]mendment.' \"  Quinn, 815 F.2d at 157 (quoting United States v. Davies, 768 F.2d 893, 901 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1008, 106 S.Ct. 533, 88 L.Ed.2d 464 (1985));  see also United States v. Place, 462 U.S. 696, 709-10, 103 S.Ct. 2637, 2645-46, 77 L.Ed.2d 110 (1983) (declining to adopt any outside time limitation on a permissible Terry stop, but holding ninety-minute detention of luggage unreasonable on specific facts of case);  United States v. Vega, 72 F.3d 507, 514-16 (7th Cir.1995) (upholding sixty-two minute stop;  \"the crux of our inquiry is whether the nature of the restraint meets the Fourth Amendment's standard of objective reasonableness\").  \"[C]ommon sense and ordinary human experience must govern over rigid criteria.\"  Quinn, 815 F.2d at 157 (quoting Sharpe, 470 U.S. at 685, 105 S.Ct. at 1575).   Indeed, whether a particular investigatory stop is too long turns on a consideration of all relevant factors, including \"the law enforcement purposes to be served by the stop as well as the time reasonably needed to effectuate those purposes.\"  Sharpe, 470 U.S. at 685, 105 S.Ct. at 1575.   Moreover, a court should ask \"whether the police diligently pursued a means of investigation that was likely to confirm or dispel their suspicions quickly, during which time it was necessary to detain the defendant.\"  Id. at 686, 105 S.Ct. at 1575.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, time of detention cannot be the sole criteria for measuring the intrusiveness of the detention.   Clearly, from the perspective of the detainee, other factors, including the force used to detain the individual, the restrictions placed on his or her personal movement, and the information conveyed to the detainee concerning the reasons for the stop and its impact on his or her rights, affect the nature and extent of the intrusion and, thus, should factor into the analysis.   Cf. Zapata, 18 F.3d at 975 (distinction between investigatory stop and de facto arrest turns in part on what \"a reasonable [person] in the suspect's position would have understood his [or her] situation\" to be).   Finally, the Supreme Court has admonished that, in all events, \"[a] court making this assessment should take care to consider whether the police are acting in a swiftly developing situation, and in such cases the court should not indulge in unrealistic second-guessing.\"  Sharpe, 470 U.S. at 686, 105 S.Ct. at 1575.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though the issue is exceedingly close, we believe that, on the circumstances that obtain here, the district court did not err in refusing to suppress Hunter's statements and gesture leading to the discovery of James Hall.   Initially we note that, although Hunter challenges the length of the Connecticut detention in its entirety, the statements and gestures that he seeks to suppress occurred within the first seventy-five minutes of the stop.   Thus, we limit the scope of our analysis accordingly and do not address whether the district court would have erred in failing to suppress any statements or evidence obtained later in the stop.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More importantly, when limited to this time frame, we do not find the scope of the stop particularly unreasonable.   There is no evidence or even an allegation of less than diligent behavior on the part of the police.   The officers on location used a number of different investigative techniques in their efforts to pursue quickly any information that might have dispelled the reasonable suspicion that initially triggered the stop.   Officer Richard ran the registration check of the Sunbird immediately after stopping Hunter.   Trooper Hall promptly informed Hunter of his rights and questioned him about where he had been since the time of the robbery.   Other officers brought a teller from the bank to the scene in an attempt to establish definitively whether or not Hunter had participated in the robbery.   Trooper Heller, once on the scene, promptly telephoned the rental agency in an effort to learn more about the individuals who had rented the automobile.   In short, we think that the record clearly belies any contention that the police officers involved neglected to employ any reasonably available alternative methods that could have significantly shortened their inquiry.   See Quinn, 815 F.2d at 158.   The excessive length of Hunter's detention arose not because the officers engaged in dilatory tactics, but, instead, because their investigative efforts, though reasonable under the circumstances, failed to dispel the suspicion that gave rise to the stop.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, while it is clear that Hunter had a constitutional right not to answer any questions, the fact that his responses were evasive and, at times, defiant is relevant in evaluating the scope of the officers' conduct.   See, e.g., id.  (detention of forty-five to sixty minutes;  noting that it would have been unreasonable to release defendants when their answers to initial questions raised rather than lowered suspicion);  United States v. Richards, 500 F.2d 1025, 1029 (9th Cir.1974) (detention over an hour;  \"implausible and evasive responses ... indicated that something was awry and created even more reason for the investigation being pursued further\"), cert. denied, 420 U.S. 924, 95 S.Ct. 1118, 43 L.Ed.2d 393 (1975).   Not only did Hunter's incomplete and vague responses reasonably heighten the officers' suspicion that Hunter had participated in the robbery, they also made the attempt to dispel that suspicion more difficult.   Indeed, had Hunter cooperated initially and told Officer Richard that he had been at James Hall's house, the length of the stop would have been much shorter.   Cf. Sharpe, 470 U.S. at 687-88, 105 S.Ct. at 1576-77 (upholding detention where delay attributable in large part to defendant's evasive attempts to avoid stop).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, in attempting to strike the proper balance, we note that the governmental purposes served by the detention in this case are substantial.   Indeed, several factors, specific to this case, reasonably enhanced the government's interest in detaining Hunter.   First, the nature of the suspected criminal conduct, a daylight armed robbery of a bank involving physical threats to both customers and bank personnel, was severe.   Second, the detention took place shortly after the robbery in a nearby town not far from the bank.   As a noted commentator has explained, that \"the suspected crime is serious enough to prompt flight if the suspect is freed, or ... recent enough that if probable cause soon develops it would be desirable to arrest the suspect and subject him [or her] to a search\" are both legitimate reasons for continuing custody that must be considered in the total balance.   3 Wayne R. LaFave, Search and Seizure &#167; 9.2(f), at 386 (2d ed. 1987).   Finally, the fact that at the time of the stop Hunter was preparing to enter an interstate highway in a rented vehicle bearing out-of-state plates weighs on the government's side of the scale.   Objectively, from the perspective of the officers on the scene, if they had not detained Hunter at that point, he could easily have left the jurisdiction and evaded the dragnet of the Connecticut State Police.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we do not believe, on the facts of this case, that the stop was needlessly intrusive.   Although the police detained Hunter in the back of Officer Richard's vehicle, he was never handcuffed, see, e.g., State v. Reid, 135 N.H. 376, 605 A.2d 1050, 1053-54 (1992) (placing defendant in cruiser does not make Terry stop unreasonable);  cf. Quinn, 815 F.2d at 157 n. 2 (use of handcuffs does not make Terry stop de facto arrest), nor did the officers keep the rear door to the police cruiser continuously closed.   Moreover, there is no evidence in the record to suggest that any officer ever drew a gun on Hunter.   Cf. United States v. Trullo, 809 F.2d 108, 113 (1st Cir.)  (use of weapons without more does not elevate stop to de facto arrest), cert. denied, 482 U.S. 916, 107 S.Ct. 3191, 96 L.Ed.2d 679 (1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the officers informed Hunter that, although he was not free to leave, he was not under arrest, and that they were detaining him only for investigative purposes because a car identical to his Pontiac Sunbird had been involved in a bank robbery earlier that day.   Additionally, only fifteen minutes after Officer Richard first stopped Hunter, Trooper Hall read Hunter his Miranda rights.   Clearly, timely disclosure of such information (e.g., the reasons for the detention, and an explanation of the detainee's rights) has the potential to reduce the stress of such a detention and, thus, minimize its intrusiveness.   See Place, 462 U.S. at 710, 103 S.Ct. at 2646 (noting that incorrect information given to defendant by law enforcement officials during detention militated against finding scope of stop reasonable);  United States v. LaFrance, 879 F.2d 1, 7 (1st Cir.1989) (similar);  cf. Brown v. Illinois, 422 U.S. 590, 603, 95 S.Ct. 2254, 2261-62, 45 L.Ed.2d 416 (1975) (fact that Miranda warnings given is relevant in determining whether statement given following illegal arrest can be considered voluntary).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, although as we have said the issue is exceptionally close, we think that, on the record before us, the balance tips in favor of the government.   Admittedly, Hunter's detention following the Franklin robbery was hardly what one would normally consider \"brief,\" and, under circumstances different from those found here, we have no doubt that an investigative detention of similar length would unacceptably offend the Constitution.   Nonetheless, we are not persuaded, on the facts of this case (i.e. evidence sought to be suppressed was obtained during the first seventy-five minutes of the stop, diligent efforts by the police to dispel reasonable suspicion, defendant's evasive responses significantly contributing to delay, substantial government interests in the detention, and prompt disclosure to the defendant of his rights and the reasons for the detention), that the district court erred in refusing to suppress Hunter's statements and gesture.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Hunter's Alabama Arrest</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hunter also challenges the legality of his arrest in Alabama.   Hunter contends that, at the moment of his arrest, the arresting officer did not have probable cause to take Hunter into custody.   This challenge is without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that, at the time Hunter was taken into custody, Deputy Fulmer and the other officers involved in Hunter's arrest were aware of an outstanding federal arrest warrant for Hunter.   Such a finding, if supported by the record, is a sufficient basis to support the arrest.   See Whiteley v. Warden, Wyo.  State Penitentiary, 401 U.S. 560, 568, 91 S.Ct. 1031, 1037, 28 L.Ed.2d 306 (1971) (\"police officers called upon to aid other officers in executing arrest warrants are entitled to assume that the officers requesting aid offered the magistrate the information requisite to support an independent judicial assessment of probable cause\");  cf. Hensley, 469 U.S. at 229-32, 105 S.Ct. at 680-82 (extending Whiteley to cover reliance on a flyer or bulletin to establish reasonable suspicion justifying investigatory stops).   Fulmer's testimony at the suppression hearing, stating that, prior to Hunter's arrest, he knew about the warrant and had alerted the other officers involved to this fact, amply supports the finding.   The fact that Fulmer's report made subsequent to the arrest fails to mention the warrant is of little moment.   Deputy Fulmer explained at the suppression hearing that his report was incomplete, and the district court was fully entitled to credit that testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. McCarthy's Alabama Arrest</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCarthy's challenges to his stop and arrest in Chilton County, Alabama, on April 23, 1993, are equally unavailing.   McCarthy contends that no reasonable basis or probable cause existed to stop his pickup truck as it drove away from the power station.   Moreover, he contends that, even if the police had sufficient reasonable suspicion to detain him briefly for investigative purposes, the detention became an illegal de facto arrest because he was taken into custody and held without probable cause until 1:00 a.m. the next day when a warrant finally issued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, we disagree that the district court clearly erred in finding that Deputy Fulmer had sufficient reasonable suspicion to have McCarthy's truck pulled over.   Fulmer testified that, at the time of the stop, he was generally aware of the details of the ongoing Franklin investigation.   See Hensley, 469 U.S. at 229-32, 105 S.Ct. at 680-82 (police without specific knowledge of facts supporting flyer or bulletin issued concerning suspects may nonetheless rely on the flyer or bulletin to supply reasonable suspicion justifying an investigatory stop).   He stated that he specifically knew that McCarthy and Hunter were suspects in a series of bank robberies, that the two men were suspected to be living together in the area, that McCarthy was falsely using the name John E. Perry, and that an arrest warrant existed for Hunter.   Moreover, Fulmer testified that he knew that the Isuzu truck was registered to a \"John E. Perry,\" and that he believed that person to be the John E. Perry under suspicion by the FBI.   These facts alone arguably give rise to a reasonable suspicion sufficient to justify a brief investigatory stop of McCarthy.   More importantly, adding to this collection McCarthy's presence at the scene following Hunter's flight significantly heightened the suspicion concerning McCarthy's involvement.   Thus, we find no error in the district court's finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, we note that Deputy Fulmer testified that, at the time he ordered the stop, he did not definitely know whether McCarthy or Hunter was driving the truck or whether Hunter was a passenger.   Clearly, it was conceivable that Hunter, after initially fleeing on foot, could have run to, and continued his escape in, McCarthy's Isuzu pickup truck.   Thus, independent of his suspicion about McCarthy's involvement in the robberies, Fulmer could justifiably have ordered the stop simply to determine whether or not Hunter was inside the truck.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we find no error in the finding that probable cause to hold McCarthy arose shortly after the initial stop.   Under Alabama state law it is an offense to provide illegal identification to a police officer.   Ala.Code &#167; 13A-9-18.1 (\"Giving of false name or address to a law enforcement officer.\");   cf. Ala.Code &#167; 13A-9-18 (\"Criminal impersonation.\").   Fulmer testified that, at the time of the arrest, he knew McCarthy's identification of himself as Perry was false and that such identification violated Alabama state law.   Thus, once McCarthy provided his driver's license to the trooper who stopped him, sufficient probable cause arose to take him into custody.   We find no clear error in the district court's crediting this testimony or in holding that it provided a sufficient basis for detaining McCarthy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Seizure of McCarthy's Two Suitcases</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCarthy also challenges the seizure of his two suitcases.   McCarthy contends that the district court erroneously found that the seizure of the weapons and the other items discovered in his maroon suitcase properly came within the \"plain view\" exception to the warrant requirement.   He argues that the incriminating nature of the evidence was not immediately apparent to Deputy Fulmer.   McCarthy also contends that no credible evidence established that he owned the seized weapons or that they were actually found in his suitcase.   With respect to his second suitcase, McCarthy argues that the district court erred in finding that he had no expectation of privacy in the American Tourister suitcase.   McCarthy maintains that, though he left the suitcase in Henderson's trailer, he left it closed and locked.   Moreover, he contends that he had not abandoned the suitcase because he intended to retrieve it later in the evening on the day of his arrest.   We find these arguments unpersuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To satisfy the \"plain view\" exception to the warrant requirement, the government must show that (1) the law enforcement agent was legally in a position to observe the seized evidence, and (2) the incriminating nature of the evidence was \"immediately apparent\" to the officer.   See United States v. Giannetta, 909 F.2d 571, 578 (1st Cir.1990).   The incriminating nature of the evidence is \"immediately apparent,\" if the officer, upon observing the evidence, has probable cause to believe the item is contraband or evidence of a crime.  Id.  \"A practical nontechnical probability that incriminating evidence is involved is all that is required.\"  Texas v. Brown, 460 U.S. 730, 742, 103 S.Ct. 1535, 1543, 75 L.Ed.2d 502 (1983) (quotations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While it is true that the district court failed to make an explicit finding on the \"immediately apparent\" prong, the oversight matters little in the context of this case.   Deputy Fulmer knew that McCarthy, along with Hunter, was a suspect in a series of armed bank robberies.   Without question, the automatic weapons, ammunition and bullet-proof vest were all potential instrumentalities of such crimes.   We think a finding that the incriminating nature of the evidence was immediately apparent to Fulmer, implicit in the district court's refusal to suppress the weapons and other items seized from the suitcase, is clearly supported by the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also find little merit in McCarthy's contention that no credible evidence established that he owned the weapons and other items seized or that they were actually in his suitcase prior to its being opened.   As an initial matter, we note that McCarthy's contention is more appropriately considered as an attack on the relevancy of the seized weapons rather than a fourth amendment issue.   If, as McCarthy contends, he did not own the weapons and did not store them in his suitcase, then the seizure does not violate his fourth amendment rights because it did not intrude on his privacy.   See Sanchez, 943 F.2d at 112-13 (Fourth Amendment rights are personal).   On the other hand, if McCarthy's allegation that he did not own or possess the weapons and other items is true, then they would not have been relevant as evidence in his criminal trial.   See Fed.R.Evid. 401 (evidence is relevant if it tends to make a disputed fact more or less probable).   When, as here, the relevancy of specific evidence turns on a condition of fact--whether the suitcase actually contained the seized weapons and other items--a court shall admit it subject to the introduction of evidence sufficient to fulfill that condition.   Fed.R.Evid. 104(b);  United States v. Trenkler, 61 F.3d 45, 53 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Gene Ellison, the person who purportedly cut the lock off the maroon suitcase, did not testify at the suppression hearing, we think the evidence adequately supports the conclusion that the items seized were in the suitcase prior to its opening.   Henderson testified that, although Ellison took the padlock off the suitcase while he was in the other room, he, not Ellison, rummaged through the suitcase and found the weapons and the bulletproof vest.   Moreover, Henderson testified that the suitcase was extremely heavy and that he needed Ellison's assistance to move it from the back room of his trailer.   These facts reasonably support the inference that the weapons and other items were in the suitcase prior to Ellison's removal of the lock.   Furthermore, that the items were in the suitcase, reasonably supports the inference that they belonged to McCarthy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we find no clear error in the court's finding that McCarthy had no legitimate expectation of privacy in the contents of the American Tourister suitcase.   Based on Henderson's testimony, the district court supportably found that McCarthy left the suitcase unlocked and open in the back room of Henderson's trailer, a room to which McCarthy did not have exclusive access.   Thus, McCarthy clearly had assumed the risk that Henderson might consent to a search of the room (and that the search would extend to any items, like the suitcase, sitting open in plain view).   See, e.g., United States v. Hall, 979 F.2d 77, 79 (6th Cir.1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 947, 113 S.Ct. 1357, 122 L.Ed.2d 736 (1993).   Moreover, McCarthy's legitimate expectation argument is further undercut by the fact that he left the open suitcase in Henderson's trailer after Henderson told McCarthy that he and Hunter had to leave.   Cf. United States v. Rahme, 813 F.2d 31, 34-35 (2d Cir.1987) (hotel guest had no expectation of privacy in luggage left in room when, because of his arrest, he defaulted on rent due).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Sentencing Issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now turn to the issues Hunter and McCarthy raise concerning their respective sentences.   Hunter complains that the district court unfairly sentenced him to a mandatory five-year sentence under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) while simultaneously enhancing his total offense level for brandishing a firearm during and in relation to the Connecticut and Alabama robberies.   Hunter also contends that the district court erroneously ordered his entire federal sentence to run consecutively to his unexpired state sentence.   McCarthy contends that the district court incorrectly sentenced him as an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e).   We discuss each argument below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the sentencing context, we review factbound matters for clear error, and such facts need only be supported by a preponderance of the evidence.  United States v. Andujar, 49 F.3d 16, 25 (1st Cir.1995).   When the sentencing issues involve questions of law, including the applicability of a relevant guideline, our review is de novo.  United States v. St. Cyr, 977 F.2d 698, 701 (1st Cir.1992).   Within certain limits, decisions to impose concurrent or consecutive sentences are committed to the judgment of the sentencing court, and such decisions are reviewed only for an abuse of discretion.   See United States v. Whiting, 28 F.3d 1296, 1310 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, ----, ----, ----, 115 S.Ct. 378, 498, 499, 532, 130 L.Ed.2d 328, 408, 435 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Hunter's Sentencing Issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p>a. Brandishing Enhancement</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 2K2.4 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides, inter alia, that a person convicted under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment as required by the statute.   U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.4(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  In turn, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) specifies that any individual convicted of using a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime shall be sentenced to a mandatory term of at least five years in prison to be served consecutively to any other punishment.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c).   Application Note 2 to U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.4 adds that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p>Where a sentence under [&#167; 2K2.4] is imposed in conjunction with a sentence for an underlying offense, any specific offense characteristic for the possession, use, or discharge of an explosive or firearm ... is not to be applied in respect to the guideline for the underlying offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.4, comment.  (n. 2).   Thus, where a defendant receives a mandatory consecutive sentence for use of a firearm during a crime of violence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c), a court should not also enhance the defendant's base offense level for the underlying crime of violence to account for the use of the firearm.   Id.;  see also U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.1, comment.  (n. 1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district court treated, for sentencing purposes, the conspiracy to commit the Alabama, Connecticut and Maine bank robberies in Count One as three separate counts of conspiracy to commit the three separate bank robberies.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.2(d) (\"A conviction on a count charging a conspiracy to commit more than one offense shall be treated as if the defendant had been convicted on a separate count of conspiracy for each offense that the defendant conspired to commit.\").   Accordingly, the court calculated a separate base offense level for each conspiracy and then combined these levels together to produce a single total offense level.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.4.   In calculating the separate base offense levels for the conspiracies to commit the Alabama and the Connecticut robberies, the district court--in both instances--applied a five-level enhancement for brandishing a firearm.   U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B3.1(b)(2)(C).   Because the &#167; 924(c) charge related to the Maine bank robbery, however, the district court did not apply the brandishing enhancement when calculating the base offense level for that conspiracy.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.4, comment.  (n. 2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hunter contends that the district court erred in its calculation, contending that it should not have separated the Alabama and Connecticut robberies from the Maine robbery in determining whether to apply the brandishing enhancement.   Hunter argues that Application Note 2 to &#167; 2K2.4 clearly states that where the &#167; 924(c) sentence is imposed \"in conjunction with a sentence for the underlying offense\" no enhancement may be applied, and, in this case, the underlying offense was collectively the entire conspiracy to commit the three bank robberies.   Therefore, Hunter concludes, the district court should not have applied the brandishing enhancement to the conspiracies to commit the Alabama and Connecticut robberies because they were part of the \"underlying offense.\"   We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We decline Hunter's invitation to read the phrase \"the underlying offense\" in Application Note 2 to preclude the application of the brandishing enhancements to the conspiracies to commit the Alabama and Connecticut robberies.   First, &#167; 1B1.2(d) clearly instructs the sentencing court to treat a count charging a conspiracy to commit multiple offenses as separate counts of conspiracy for each offense the defendant conspired to commit.   U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.2(d);  see also U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.2, comment.  (n. 8).   Thus, it is clear that the Sentencing Commission does not consider, for the purposes of applying the guidelines, a conspiracy to commit multiple offenses as constituting one single integrated offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the district court's application of the brandishing enhancement does not undercut the purposes of Note 2.   Application Note 2 is intended to prevent double counting.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.4, comment.  (backg'd) (\"To avoid double counting, when a sentence under this section is imposed in conjunction with a sentence for an underlying offense, any specific offense characteristic for explosive or firearm discharge, use, or possession is not applied in respect to such underlying offense.\").   In this case, no double counting occurred.   Hunter's conviction under &#167; 924(c) was for using or carrying the firearm during and in relation to the Maine robbery, and the district court carefully eschewed applying the brandishing enhancement when calculating the offense level for Hunter's conspiracy to commit that offense.   The court applied the brandishing enhancement only when calculating the offense levels relating to the Alabama and Connecticut robberies.   Thus, the same conduct did not unfairly give rise to both a sentencing enhancement and a separate mandatory sentence under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p>b. Consecutive or Concurrent Sentences</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1988, Hunter pled guilty in Connecticut state court to possession of cocaine with intent to sell.   As a result, he was sentenced to a term of ten years in state prison.   After serving three years, the balance of Hunter's sentence was suspended and he was released on three years probation.   Hunter was still on probation at the time of the Franklin robbery.   Shortly after the Franklin robbery occurred, an order charging Hunter with violation of probation was issued, and, ultimately, on November 16, 1993, a Connecticut state court revoked Hunter's probation and sentenced him to seven-years imprisonment (apparently the unexpired portion of his suspended ten-year sentence for cocaine possession).   At the time of sentencing in this case, Hunter was serving the remainder of his Connecticut prison term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At Hunter's federal sentencing, the district court ruled that his entire federal sentence should run consecutively to his state sentence.   In so ruling, the court relied on U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3(c), which provides that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p>the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run consecutively to the prior undischarged term of imprisonment to the extent necessary to achieve a reasonable incremental punishment for the instant offense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court effectively held that, because the state sentence stemmed not just from the underlying cocaine offense but also from the separate probation violation, the federal sentence should run consecutively to the state sentence in order to insure the necessary incremental punishment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Hunter contends that, in applying subsection (c) and sentencing Hunter to a wholly consecutive federal sentence, the district court erred because it failed to follow the method outlined in Application Note 3 to &#167; 5G1.3 for calculating the appropriate incremental punishment.   Note 3 provides that:[t]o the extent practicable, the court should consider a reasonable incremental penalty to be a sentence for the instant offense that results in a combined sentence of imprisonment that approximates the total punishment that would have been imposed under &#167; 5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction) had all of the offenses been federal offenses for which sentences were being imposed at the same time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3, comment.

Whiting, 28 F.3d 1296, 1310-11 (1st Cir.1994) (plain error for sentencing court to impose federal sentence wholly consecutive to state sentence without attempting to compute the proper equivalent total punishment called for by Note 3).   Thus, Hunter contends that, before sentencing him to a wholly consecutive sentence, the district court should have calculated the sentence he would have received if the revocation of probation and the instant bank robbery offenses had all been federal offenses for which he was sentenced at the same time.   We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, as noted, &#167; 5G1.3(c) instructs the district court, in cases where it applies, to sentence defendants to consecutive sentences \"to the extent necessary to achieve a reasonable incremental punishment.\"   Then, Application Note 3 prescribes a method for calculating the \"reasonable incremental punishment\" that we have recognized applies in \"a good many of the cases likely to arise under subsection (c).\"  United States v. Gondek, 65 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1995).   Implicit in this recognition, however, is the fact that, although the method applies in a \"good many cases,\" it does not cover every case.   Indeed, as Application Note 3 itself explains, the methodology it prescribes is intended only \"to assist the court in determining the appropriate sentence.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3, comment.  (n. 3);  cf. id.  (cautioning that method should be followed only \"[t]o the extent practicable\").   Therefore, while it is evident that a sentencing court should initially look to Note 3 for guidance in calculating an appropriate incremental punishment, it nonetheless has discretion to follow a different course in a small number of cases where adherence to Note 3 would be impracticable and result in an inappropriate incremental punishment.   See, e.g., United States v. Brassell, 49 F.3d 274, 278 (7th Cir.1995) (court has discretion in appropriate circumstances to disregard methodology outlined in Note 3), United States v. Torrez 40 F.3d 84, 87 (5th Cir.1994) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district court did not err by following a different course.   First, it is far from clear how, and if, Application Note 3 applies to the facts of this case.   None of the four detailed examples outlined in Note 3 explain how to sentence a defendant who is serving out a term following the revocation of probation.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3, comment.  (n. 3).   Moreover, the text of Note 3 instructs that the incremental punishment should be calculated according to the grouping rules set forth in &#167; 5G1.2.   Section 5G1.2 (and the other sections to which it refers), however, does not discuss how to handle a sentence imposed following a probation revocation.   The guidelines do discuss sentences imposed for probation violations separately under U.S.S.G. Ch. 7.   Significantly, Application Note 5 to U.S.S.G. &#167; 7B1.3 instructs that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p>it is the Commission's recommendation that any sentence of imprisonment for a criminal offense that is imposed after revocation of probation or supervised release be run consecutively to any term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 7B1.3, comment.  (n. 5) (emphasis added).   If anything, Note 5 suggests that the course followed by the district court, imposing a wholly consecutive sentence, was correct.   See Torrez, 40 F.3d at 87-88 (Section 7B1.3 suggests that--as in this case--notwithstanding Note 3 to &#167; 5G1.3, imposition of wholly consecutive sentence would be appropriate in case involving a probation revocation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, Application Note 3 fails to explain whether, in a situation like the present, a court should consider the underlying state drug conviction in calculating the equivalent federal sentence.   In his argument, Hunter ignores the underlying drug possession and contends that Note 3 requires the court to combine only the guideline sentence for federal probation revocation with the guideline sentence for the instant bank robbery charges.   Such an approach, however, fails to account for the fact that, in sentencing Hunter to the unexpired portion of his suspended ten-year drug sentence, the state court arguably aimed to punish Hunter for both the probation violation and the underlying cocaine possession.   Cf. United States v. Gullickson, 981 F.2d 344, 346-47 (8th Cir.1992) (instructing sentencing court to calculate appropriate incremental punishment by estimating equivalent federal sentence for state forgery and other offenses and combining that with the sentence for instant federal offense where defendant, at the time of sentencing, was serving state prison term following revocation of probation imposed for state forgery conviction;  court notably did not instruct sentencing court to estimate federal penalty for probation violation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we note that Hunter's case is unlike the usual situation governed by &#167; 5G1.3(c), in which the offenses supporting the separate sentences arise from related conduct.   See Gondek, 65 F.3d at 3.   In such cases (e.g., a state drug charge and a related federal firearms charge), sentencing according to the grouping rules as suggested by Application Note 3 makes much sense.   In other words, when the federal sentence arises from conduct or acts directly related to that on which the state sentence is based, application of the guidelines' grouping rules accords with fairness principles inherent in the guidelines by \"limit[ing] the significance of the formal charging decision and ... prevent[ing] multiple punishment for substantially identical offense conduct.\"   U.S.S.G. Ch. 3 Pt. D, intro. comment.   Hunter's situation, however, is different.   The federal bank robbery convictions arise from conduct completely unrelated to the cocaine possession that lies at the heart of the state sentence.   In cases like Hunter's, where the acts or conduct giving rise to the different sentences are not closely related, the rationale of the guidelines' grouping rules does not apply.   Indeed, Hunter's situation is more \"closely akin to the case of the defendant who commits a new offense while still in prison, the very situation in which [U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3(a) ] instructs that the new sentence is to be served consecutively.\"  Gondek, 65 F.3d at 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we do not believe that the method for calculating a \"reasonable incremental punishment\" prescribed in Application Note 3 clearly addresses Hunter's situation.   In short, it would not have been \"practicable\" in light of the inconsistencies outlined above for the district court to have attempted to follow Note 3, and, thus, it did not err in failing to do so.   Moreover, we do not think the court otherwise abused its discretion in sentencing Hunter to a wholly consecutive federal sentence.   The court carefully considered the circumstances of this case and determined that such a sentence was necessary in order to insure a reasonable incremental punishment for the federal bank robbery charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, we believe the Sentencing Commission's adoption in 1993 of Application Note 4 to U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3 implicitly supports this conclusion.   In cases where a defendant has committed a federal offense while on probation, Note 4 expressly limits a district court's discretion in determining a reasonable incremental punishment by providing that the court must order the entire federal sentence to run consecutively to any sentence imposed upon revocation of probation.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3, comment.  (n. 4).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  Significantly, the Sentencing Commission added Note 4 to &#167; 5G1.3 without altering in any way the language of Application Note 3.   Thus, in doing so, the Commission implicitly recognized that, prior to the adoption of Note 4, a sentencing court at the very least had the discretion in cases like Hunter's (e.g., probation revocation cases) to ignore the methodology set forth in Note 3 and order a wholly consecutive sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. McCarthy's Sentencing Issue</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, McCarthy challenges the district court's use of his seven prior state attempted-murder convictions as a single predicate offense in determining whether he was subject to sentencing as an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C. 924(e).   McCarthy contends that the district court should not have considered the attempted-murder convictions because they arose out of the same incident that gave rise to a \"non-qualifying\" bank larceny conviction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the government explains, the sentencing court did not count the larceny conviction as a separate predicate offense, but instead counted only the state attempted-murder convictions (and the court counted those only as a single predicate offense).   Thus, the district court did not consider an arguably non-qualifying predicate offense (i.e., the bank larceny conviction) in determining whether it should sentence McCarthy as an armed career criminal.   McCarthy's implicit contention that, whenever the same conduct gives rise to both qualifying and non-qualifying convictions, a sentencing court may consider neither in determining whether defendant qualifies as an armed career criminal is completely without logic or support.   Accordingly, McCarthy's complaint lacks merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Trooper Heller obtained Lance Hall's driver's license number from the rental agency.

To the contrary, we think a fair reading of his opening argument to this court and the arguments he made in his briefs to the district court below belies this contention.   In any event, the district court's finding that Officer Richard properly acted in initially detaining Hunter after spotting him shortly after the robbery, driving a red Pontiac Sunbird, is eminently supportable.   The close proximity in both distance and time to the Franklin robbery combined with the fact that Hunter's car identically matched the description of the vehicle the suspects were reported to be driving are articulable and specific facts that clearly gave rise to the reasonable suspicion needed to justify the initial stop</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> In Michigan v.

The Court then listed, with apparent approval, a variety of different investigative techniques, including those used here, that police might appropriately use during the course of an investigative stop to dispel their reasonable suspicion.  Summers, 452 U.S. at 700 n. 12, 101 S.Ct. at 2593 n. 12 (quoting 3 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure &#167; 9.2, at 36-37 (1978))</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Furthermore, we also have substantial doubt concerning the scope of the evidence Hunter seeks to suppress (specifically, the testimony of James Hall).   Though we question, but need not decide, whether the government has sufficiently developed the record below to support such a finding, see United States v. Infante-Ruiz, 13 F.3d 498, 503 (1st Cir.1994) (\"[G]overnment bears burden of showing, by reference to 'demonstrated historical facts' and by a preponderance of the evidence, that the information or item would inevitably have been discovered by lawful means.\"), we think it likely that, in the normal course of the investigation, the government would have inevitably discovered James Hall.   Indeed, James Hall's brother, Lance, rented the Pontiac Sunbird.   Trooper Heller obtained this information and the fact that Hunter was listed as a driver on the rental agreement solely on the basis of the car's license plate number.   It is true that the record lacks any evidence clearly establishing that the police would have possessed the license plate number absent the stop, or that, during the normal course of the investigation, officers would have spoken to Lance Hall and necessarily have made the connection to his brother James.   Nonetheless, we do not think it is unduly speculative to infer that such events would have occurred.   Had the police spoken to Lance Hall, it is at least arguably reasonable that he would have directed them to his brother James, who also knew Hunter and lived in the vicinity of the Franklin robbery</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> McCarthy also challenges the search of his Isuzu pickup truck, arguing that it was the fruit of his illegal arrest and the illegal search of his maroon suitcase.

Furthermore, we also reject McCarthy's final challenge concerning the search of his storage shed in Maine because it is likewise substantially predicated on the assumption that the earlier arrest and seizures were illegal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> All guidelines' citations, unless otherwise indicated, are to the November 1994 Guidelines Manual, the manual in effect on the date of sentencing.

Hunter's Connecticut Detention</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 6, 1992, around 1:45 p.m., two men robbed a bank in Franklin, Connecticut.   Each man wore a plastic, Halloween-type mask, covering his entire face, and each was armed, one with a pump-action shotgun and the other with a semi-automatic pistol.   The man carrying the shotgun stood in the bank's lobby, issuing commands, while the other vaulted the teller's counter and collected the money.   They fled the bank in a light-blue GMC Jimmy truck.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A short time later, the Connecticut State Police located the truck, abandoned in an industrial park less than a mile from the bank.   Witnesses reported that a red Pontiac Sunbird bearing Rhode Island license plates recently had been parked near the spot where the abandoned GMC Jimmy was found.   Subsequently, the police issued an updated radio bulletin, indicating that the two suspects were now believed to be travelling in the red Pontiac Sunbird.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About 2:30 p.m., Officer Arthur Richard of the Norwich Police Department spotted a red Pontiac Sunbird bearing Rhode Island license plates at a gas station, not far from Franklin.   Officer Richard reported the sighting, and, after the car left the station, stopped the vehicle as it prepared to enter an interstate highway.   Officer Richard ordered the driver out of the Sunbird, patted him down for weapons and directed him to take a seat in the back of his police cruiser.   The police cruiser's internal rear door handles were not functional and a plastic spit guard and a wire cage separated its rear and front seats.   Officer Richard did not handcuff the driver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to Officer Richard's questioning, the driver identified himself as Hunter.   Officer Richard ran a registration check on the Sunbird and learned that it was registered to a rental agency at a Rhode Island airport.   Hunter told Richard that a friend had rented the automobile for him because his own car was under repair.   Hunter, however, refused to identify the friend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within minutes, several other police officers, including Connecticut State Troopers Jerry Hall and Louis Heller, arrived on the scene.   Trooper Hall spoke to Hunter through the open rear door of Richard's cruiser and detected alcohol on Hunter's breath.   Hunter admitted drinking a few beers with a friend, but declined to identify the friend.   At Hall's request, Hunter took a field sobriety test, which he passed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About 2:43 p.m., Trooper Hall advised Hunter of his Miranda rights and informed him that, although he was not under arrest, he was being detained for investigative purposes.   Hunter stated that he understood his rights and waived them, but nonetheless declined to say where he had been since 1:00 p.m., stating only that he had been with a \"Born-Again-Christian\" friend.   At some point, Trooper Hall explained that the officers were detaining him because his Pontiac Sunbird matched identically the description of a vehicle involved in a bank robbery that had occurred earlier that day.   Trooper Hall continued to question Hunter intermittently for about forty-five minutes.   During that time, other officers drove a teller from the bank by the cruiser in an unsuccessful attempt to identify Hunter as one of the robbers.   In addition, Trooper Hall took three Polaroid photographs of Hunter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, Trooper Heller learned that the agency registered as the owner of the Pontiac Sunbird had rented the vehicle to Lance Hall, a black male, who had listed Hunter, who is white, on the rental agreement as a co-driver.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  After receiving this information, Heller went to a nearby bar and questioned patrons in an attempt to determine whether Hunter and another individual had stopped there earlier.   Upon returning to the police cruiser in which Hunter was still being detained, Trooper Heller asked Hunter where he had been prior to the stop.   Hunter replied that he had not been anywhere near Franklin, but instead had spent the day at a friend's place in the woods.   Hunter, however, claimed not to remember his friend's name nor where the place was located.   On the basis of the information he had obtained from the rental car agency, Trooper Heller then asked Hunter if his friend was black.   With this question, Hunter became agitated, swore at Heller, and, while gesturing in one general direction, told him to find out for himself.   This occurred about 3:45 p.m., approximately seventy-five minutes after Officer Richard initially stopped Hunter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trooper Heller knew the area well and could think of only one black male living in the general direction in which Hunter had gestured.   Consequently, Trooper Heller drove to that person's house and inquired whether Hunter had visited earlier that day.   The black male living at the house identified himself as James Hall and stated that Hunter had been there with another man named John.   According to James Hall, Hunter and John had borrowed James Hall's truck earlier in the day and had later returned to Hall's house to change their clothes.   After interviewing James Hall, Heller returned to where Hunter was being detained and, at 4:43 p.m., Hunter was released.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Ensuing Investigation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following his release, Hunter remained the focus of the Franklin robbery investigation.   The investigation involved a cooperative effort between the Connecticut State Police, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\"), and, ultimately, law enforcement officials in Alabama and Maine.   During the course of the investigation, James Hall<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> revealed to investigators that Hunter's friend \"John\" had recently replaced his Alabama driver's license with a Connecticut license in the name of John E. Perry.   Investigators subsequently learned that the real John E. Perry had lost his Alabama license prior to the Franklin bank robbery and that McCarthy had used the alias John Perry in Florida following an arrest there.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The real John E. Perry, who lived in Alabama, identified McCarthy as James Hardiman, an individual who had been involved with his former wife.   Investigators also learned that, in 1991, Hunter and McCarthy had spent time together as cellmates in a Connecticut state prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the investigation progressed, Connecticut authorities apprised FBI agents in Alabama, who were investigating a series of similar Alabama bank robberies, of the events surrounding the Franklin robbery.   Accordingly, McCarthy and Hunter became suspects in the Alabama robberies.   In early 1993, Alabama FBI Agent Marshall Ridlehoover learned that McCarthy and Hunter might be living in Chilton County, Alabama.   Agent Ridlehoover alerted the Chilton County Sheriff's Department that the two men were suspects in a series of bank robberies in Alabama and Connecticut and sent the department photographs of McCarthy and Hunter.   Initially, Ridlehoover told the Chilton County Sheriff's Department that the FBI wanted to have the two men kept under surveillance.   Subsequently, Ridlehoover informed the Sheriff's Department that a federal arrest warrant for unlawful flight from prosecution had been issued for Hunter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Alabama Arrests of Hunter and McCarthy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While driving to work on the morning of April 23, 1993, Deputy Wayne Fulmer, assistant chief deputy of the Chilton County Sheriff's Department, noticed a pickup truck bearing Maine license plates.   Because the presence of Maine plates in Chilton County struck Fulmer as rather unusual, he ran a registration check on the truck and discovered that the truck was registered to a John E. Perry.   Fulmer knew at this time that FBI investigators were looking for an individual using the alias John E. Perry in connection with a series of bank robberies in Connecticut and Alabama.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that morning, a woman at the local power company, who had been shown a photograph of Hunter, reported that a person resembling Hunter had requested that power be turned on at his trailer.   After receiving this report, Fulmer brought a copy of Hunter's photograph to the woman and asked her to notify the Sheriff's Department if the man returned.   A short time later that day, the woman reported that Hunter had returned.   Upon learning this, Fulmer left for the power company and requested several back-up units to meet him there.   On the way, Fulmer alerted by radio the other officers responding to the scene that an outstanding federal warrant existed for Hunter's arrest.   The first officer to arrive at the power company identified himself to Hunter and asked to speak to him.   In response, Hunter turned and ran.   The officer radioed that the suspect was fleeing on foot and then gave chase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several officers eventually caught and arrested Hunter.   A search incident to the arrest disclosed an envelope containing $6039 in cash on Hunter's person.   Over two weeks later, on May 11, 1993, Agent Ridlehoover matched the serial numbers of twenty bills taken from the envelope to bills stolen from the Casco Northern Bank in Falmouth, Maine, on April 12, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Hunter was fleeing on foot, Deputy Fulmer, who had yet to reach the power company, spotted the same pickup truck, which he had seen earlier in the day, heading away from the power company.   Fulmer directed an Alabama state trooper who was following him to turn around and stop the truck.   At this point, Fulmer did not know the identity of either the person driving the truck or the person who had fled on foot.   After stopping the truck, the state trooper asked the driver for identification.   The driver of the truck, McCarthy, falsely identified himself as John E. Perry and gave the trooper a Maine driver's license bearing that name.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently about 12:15 p.m., McCarthy was taken into custody and transported to the Chilton County Courthouse.   McCarthy was searched and approximately $2000 in cash was found on his person.   Shortly after stopping McCarthy, an official from the Chilton County Sheriff's Department notified Connecticut officials that McCarthy was in custody.   The Connecticut officials requested that the Chilton County Sheriff's Department continue to hold McCarthy while they attempted to secure an arrest warrant based on McCarthy's alleged participation in the Franklin robbery.   Sometime after midnight, a Connecticut Superior Judge signed an arrest warrant for McCarthy for his participation in the Franklin robbery.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>D. Search and Seizure of McCarthy's Suitcases, Truck and Storage Unit</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the evening of April 23, 1993, the day of McCarthy's arrest in Alabama, Deputy Fulmer received a telephone call from Chilton County resident Gene Ellison.   Ellison told Fulmer that McCarthy and Hunter had been staying with his neighbor, Joe Henderson, and that McCarthy and Hunter had left some items in Henderson's trailer that Fulmer should see.   Deputy Fulmer agreed to come by Henderson's trailer.   When he arrived, Fulmer found a maroon suitcase laying open on Henderson's kitchen table.   An AK-47 assault rifle, a pistol, extra clips and a bullet-proof vest sat atop the suitcase in plain view.   Henderson told Fulmer that the suitcase and its contents belonged to McCarthy and asked him to take possession of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Henderson further explained that he had permitted McCarthy and Hunter to stay with him for the past six days in return for $40 rent.   Henderson knew McCarthy and Hunter because the two men had previously rented a trailer from Henderson's landlord, J.B. Ellison.   While staying with Henderson, McCarthy and Hunter had slept on a couch and an easy chair in Henderson's living room and had kept their belongings in a back bedroom that Henderson used for storage.   On Thursday, April 22, the day before the arrests, Henderson had told the two men that he was expecting company for the upcoming weekend and that they would have to leave.   When Henderson left for work on the morning of the arrests, McCarthy and Hunter were preparing to move out of the trailer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Henderson returned home that afternoon, Gene Ellison told him that the police had arrested McCarthy and Hunter.   Henderson then decided to check his trailer to see if McCarthy and Hunter had left anything behind.   In the storage room, he found two suitcases, the maroon suitcase that was closed and locked, and an American Tourister suitcase that was laying open with clothes piled on top of it.   Henderson attempted to move the maroon suitcase out of the room to a storage shed behind his trailer but was unable to do so because the suitcase was too heavy.   He asked Gene Ellison to help him.   Ellison moved the suitcase into the other room and cut the lock off of it in order to find out why it weighed so much.   After Ellison cut off the lock, Henderson opened the suitcase and discovered the weapons, the bullet-proof vest and other items.   Some time later, Henderson decided he should turn the suitcase and its contents over to the police so he asked Ellison to call the sheriff's department.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During Deputy Fulmer's visit on the evening of April 23, Henderson failed to tell him about the additional American Tourister suitcase Henderson had discovered.   Several days later, however, Henderson told an FBI agent about it during an interview.   Later, at Henderson's request, Fulmer and FBI agent Rich Schott took possession of the suitcase.   Agent Ridlehoover inventoried the American Tourister on May 1, 1993, pursuant to standard FBI practice.   No warrant was obtained for the suitcase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following McCarthy's Alabama arrest, a warrant was obtained on April 28, 1993, to search his pickup truck.   Accordingly, investigators searched the truck, finding a receipt for a storage unit located in Scarborough, Maine.   Subsequently, on May 12, 1993, FBI investigators obtained a warrant to search the storage unit and its contents.   The ensuing search revealed a footlocker containing numerous incriminating items with possible connections to the robbery of the Casco Northern Bank.   The footlocker belonged to McCarthy, and McCarthy, using the alias John Perry, had rented the storage unit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>E. Prior Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to trial, Hunter moved to suppress evidence arising from the Connecticut stop and the Alabama arrests.   With respect to the Connecticut stop, Hunter sought to suppress the statements and gesture he made during the first seventy-five minutes of the stop that ultimately led the police to James Hall.   McCarthy moved to suppress evidence arising from his Alabama arrest and the searches of the two suitcases, his pickup truck and the Maine storage unit.   A magistrate judge held a two-day evidentiary hearing on the motions and, subsequently, issued a recommended decision denying them both.   After a de novo review, the district court denied the motions, adopting substantially all of the magistrate judge's recommended findings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the ensuing trial, McCarthy and Hunter were tried together before a jury on a five-count indictment alleging various charges arising from a series of three bank robberies in Connecticut, Alabama and Maine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The jury found McCarthy and Hunter guilty of all charges, convicting the two men on Count One of conspiring to commit bank robberies in Connecticut, Alabama and Maine in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371, on Count Two of committing the Maine robbery of the Casco Northern bank in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2113(a), 2113(d) and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2, and on Count Three of knowingly using and carrying firearms during the Casco robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c).   The jury also convicted McCarthy on Count Four of being an armed career criminal in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 922(g)(1), 924(e)(1), and Hunter on Count Five of being a felon-in-possession in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 922(g)(1), 924(a)(2) and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2.   Following trial, the district court sentenced McCarthy to 387 months imprisonment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The court sentenced Hunter to 270 months imprisonment to be served consecutively to his Connecticut state sentence for violation of probation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Hunter challenges the district court's denial of his suppression motion, contending that his Connecticut detention following the Franklin robbery and his later Alabama arrest violated the Fourth Amendment.   Similarly, McCarthy challenges the denial of his suppression motion, taking issue with the district court's refusal to find error in his Alabama arrest and the subsequent search of his two suitcases, pickup truck and storage unit.   Both defendants also raise several issues relating to their respective sentences.   We address each argument in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.

Hunter's Connecticut Detention</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hunter initially challenges the legality of the Connecticut stop.   Hunter contends that the stop constituted a de facto arrest unsupported by probable cause, and, therefore, the comments and gesture he made during the first seventy-five minutes of the stop--leading eventually to the discovery of James Hall--should have been suppressed.   Furthermore, Hunter contends that the testimony of James Hall should have been suppressed as the fruit of an illegal arrest.   We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fourth Amendment does not demand that probable cause exist prior to all police action.

Indeed, it is well-settled that, based merely on a reasonable and articulable suspicion, a police officer may make a brief stop or \"seizure\" of an individual to investigate suspected past or present criminal activity.

Finally, the Supreme Court has admonished that, in all events, \"[a] court making this assessment should take care to consider whether the police are acting in a swiftly developing situation, and in such cases the court should not indulge in unrealistic second-guessing.\"  Sharpe, 470 U.S. at 686, 105 S.Ct. at 1575.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though the issue is exceedingly close, we believe that, on the circumstances that obtain here, the district court did not err in refusing to suppress Hunter's statements and gesture leading to the discovery of James Hall.   Initially we note that, although Hunter challenges the length of the Connecticut detention in its entirety, the statements and gestures that he seeks to suppress occurred within the first seventy-five minutes of the stop.   Thus, we limit the scope of our analysis accordingly and do not address whether the district court would have erred in failing to suppress any statements or evidence obtained later in the stop.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More importantly, when limited to this time frame, we do not find the scope of the stop particularly unreasonable.   There is no evidence or even an allegation of less than diligent behavior on the part of the police.   The officers on location used a number of different investigative techniques in their efforts to pursue quickly any information that might have dispelled the reasonable suspicion that initially triggered the stop.   Officer Richard ran the registration check of the Sunbird immediately after stopping Hunter.   Trooper Hall promptly informed Hunter of his rights and questioned him about where he had been since the time of the robbery.   Other officers brought a teller from the bank to the scene in an attempt to establish definitively whether or not Hunter had participated in the robbery.   Trooper Heller, once on the scene, promptly telephoned the rental agency in an effort to learn more about the individuals who had rented the automobile.   In short, we think that the record clearly belies any contention that the police officers involved neglected to employ any reasonably available alternative methods that could have significantly shortened their inquiry.   See Quinn, 815 F.2d at 158.   The excessive length of Hunter's detention arose not because the officers engaged in dilatory tactics, but, instead, because their investigative efforts, though reasonable under the circumstances, failed to dispel the suspicion that gave rise to the stop.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, while it is clear that Hunter had a constitutional right not to answer any questions, the fact that his responses were evasive and, at times, defiant is relevant in evaluating the scope of the officers' conduct.   See, e.g., id.  (detention of forty-five to sixty minutes;  noting that it would have been unreasonable to release defendants when their answers to initial questions raised rather than lowered suspicion);  United States v. Richards, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"320696\"><a href=\"/opinion/320696/united-states-v-glenn-noland-richards/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1025</span></a></span>, 1029 (9th Cir.1974) (detention over an hour;  \"implausible and evasive responses ... indicated that something was awry and created even more reason for the investigation being pursued further\"), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">924</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">393</span></span> (1975).   Not only did Hunter's incomplete and vague responses reasonably heighten the officers' suspicion that Hunter had participated in the robbery, they also made the attempt to dispel that suspicion more difficult.   Indeed, had Hunter cooperated initially and told Officer Richard that he had been at James Hall's house, the length of the stop would have been much shorter.   Cf. Sharpe, 470 U.S. at 687-88, 105 S.Ct. at 1576-77 (upholding detention where delay attributable in large part to defendant's evasive attempts to avoid stop).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, in attempting to strike the proper balance, we note that the governmental purposes served by the detention in this case are substantial.   Indeed, several factors, specific to this case, reasonably enhanced the government's interest in detaining Hunter.   First, the nature of the suspected criminal conduct, a daylight armed robbery of a bank involving physical threats to both customers and bank personnel, was severe.   Second, the detention took place shortly after the robbery in a nearby town not far from the bank.   As a noted commentator has explained, that \"the suspected crime is serious enough to prompt flight if the suspect is freed, or ... recent enough that if probable cause soon develops it would be desirable to arrest the suspect and subject him [or her] to a search\" are both legitimate reasons for continuing custody that must be considered in the total balance.   3 Wayne R. LaFave, Search and Seizure &#167; 9.2(f), at 386 (2d ed. 1987).   Finally, the fact that at the time of the stop Hunter was preparing to enter an interstate highway in a rented vehicle bearing out-of-state plates weighs on the government's side of the scale.   Objectively, from the perspective of the officers on the scene, if they had not detained Hunter at that point, he could easily have left the jurisdiction and evaded the dragnet of the Connecticut State Police.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we do not believe, on the facts of this case, that the stop was needlessly intrusive.   Although the police detained Hunter in the back of Officer Richard's vehicle, he was never handcuffed, see, e.g., State v. Reid, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">376</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">605</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1050</span></span>, 1053-54 (1992) (placing defendant in cruiser does not make Terry stop unreasonable);  cf. Quinn, 815 F.2d at 157 n. 2 (use of handcuffs does not make Terry stop de facto arrest), nor did the officers keep the rear door to the police cruiser continuously closed.   Moreover, there is no evidence in the record to suggest that any officer ever drew a gun on Hunter.   Cf. United States v. Trullo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"481633\"><a href=\"/opinion/481633/united-states-v-john-f-trullo/\"><span class=\"volume\">809</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">108</span></a></span>, 113 (1st Cir.)

Additionally, only fifteen minutes after Officer Richard first stopped Hunter, Trooper Hall read Hunter his Miranda rights.   Clearly, timely disclosure of such information (e.g., the reasons for the detention, and an explanation of the detainee's rights) has the potential to reduce the stress of such a detention and, thus, minimize its intrusiveness.   See Place, 462 U.S. at 710, 103 S.Ct. at 2646 (noting that incorrect information given to defendant by law enforcement officials during detention militated against finding scope of stop reasonable);  United States v. LaFrance, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526045\"><a href=\"/opinion/526045/united-states-v-michael-francis-lafrance/\"><span class=\"volume\">879</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.1989) (similar);  cf.

Admittedly, Hunter's detention following the Franklin robbery was hardly what one would normally consider \"brief,\" and, under circumstances different from those found here, we have no doubt that an investigative detention of similar length would unacceptably offend the Constitution.   Nonetheless, we are not persuaded, on the facts of this case (i.e. evidence sought to be suppressed was obtained during the first seventy-five minutes of the stop, diligent efforts by the police to dispel reasonable suspicion, defendant's evasive responses significantly contributing to delay, substantial government interests in the detention, and prompt disclosure to the defendant of his rights and the reasons for the detention), that the district court erred in refusing to suppress Hunter's statements and gesture.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Hunter's Alabama Arrest</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hunter also challenges the legality of his arrest in Alabama.   Hunter contends that, at the moment of his arrest, the arresting officer did not have probable cause to take Hunter into custody.   This challenge is without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that, at the time Hunter was taken into custody, Deputy Fulmer and the other officers involved in Hunter's arrest were aware of an outstanding federal arrest warrant for Hunter.   Such a finding, if supported by the record, is a sufficient basis to support the arrest.   See Whiteley v. Warden, Wyo.  State Penitentiary, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108297\"><a href=\"/opinion/108297/whiteley-v-warden-wyo-state-penitentiary/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">560</span></a></span>, 568, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108297\"><a href=\"/opinion/108297/whiteley-v-warden-wyo-state-penitentiary/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></a></span> (1971) (\"police officers called upon to aid other officers in executing arrest warrants are entitled to assume that the officers requesting aid offered the magistrate the information requisite to support an independent judicial assessment of probable cause\");  cf. Hensley, 469 U.S. at 229-32, 105 S.Ct. at 680-82 (extending Whiteley to cover reliance on a flyer or bulletin to establish reasonable suspicion justifying investigatory stops).   Fulmer's testimony at the suppression hearing, stating that, prior to Hunter's arrest, he knew about the warrant and had alerted the other officers involved to this fact, amply supports the finding.   The fact that Fulmer's report made subsequent to the arrest fails to mention the warrant is of little moment.   Deputy Fulmer explained at the suppression hearing that his report was incomplete, and the district court was fully entitled to credit that testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. McCarthy's Alabama Arrest</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCarthy's challenges to his stop and arrest in Chilton County, Alabama, on April 23, 1993, are equally unavailing.   McCarthy contends that no reasonable basis or probable cause existed to stop his pickup truck as it drove away from the power station.   Moreover, he contends that, even if the police had sufficient reasonable suspicion to detain him briefly for investigative purposes, the detention became an illegal de facto arrest because he was taken into custody and held without probable cause until 1:00 a.m. the next day when a warrant finally issued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, we disagree that the district court clearly erred in finding that Deputy Fulmer had sufficient reasonable suspicion to have McCarthy's truck pulled over.   Fulmer testified that, at the time of the stop, he was generally aware of the details of the ongoing Franklin investigation.   See Hensley, 469 U.S. at 229-32, 105 S.Ct. at 680-82 (police without specific knowledge of facts supporting flyer or bulletin issued concerning suspects may nonetheless rely on the flyer or bulletin to supply reasonable suspicion justifying an investigatory stop).   He stated that he specifically knew that McCarthy and Hunter were suspects in a series of bank robberies, that the two men were suspected to be living together in the area, that McCarthy was falsely using the name John E. Perry, and that an arrest warrant existed for Hunter.   Moreover, Fulmer testified that he knew that the Isuzu truck was registered to a \"John E. Perry,\" and that he believed that person to be the John E. Perry under suspicion by the FBI.   These facts alone arguably give rise to a reasonable suspicion sufficient to justify a brief investigatory stop of McCarthy.   More importantly, adding to this collection McCarthy's presence at the scene following Hunter's flight significantly heightened the suspicion concerning McCarthy's involvement.   Thus, we find no error in the district court's finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, we note that Deputy Fulmer testified that, at the time he ordered the stop, he did not definitely know whether McCarthy or Hunter was driving the truck or whether Hunter was a passenger.   Clearly, it was conceivable that Hunter, after initially fleeing on foot, could have run to, and continued his escape in, McCarthy's Isuzu pickup truck.   Thus, independent of his suspicion about McCarthy's involvement in the robberies, Fulmer could justifiably have ordered the stop simply to determine whether or not Hunter was inside the truck.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we find no error in the finding that probable cause to hold McCarthy arose shortly after the initial stop.   Under Alabama state law it is an offense to provide illegal identification to a police officer.   Ala.Code &#167; 13A-9-18.1 (\"Giving of false name or address to a law enforcement officer.\");   cf. Ala.Code &#167; 13A-9-18 (\"Criminal impersonation.\").   Fulmer testified that, at the time of the arrest, he knew McCarthy's identification of himself as Perry was false and that such identification violated Alabama state law.   Thus, once McCarthy provided his driver's license to the trooper who stopped him, sufficient probable cause arose to take him into custody.   We find no clear error in the district court's crediting this testimony or in holding that it provided a sufficient basis for detaining McCarthy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Seizure of McCarthy's Two Suitcases</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCarthy also challenges the seizure of his two suitcases.   McCarthy contends that the district court erroneously found that the seizure of the weapons and the other items discovered in his maroon suitcase properly came within the \"plain view\" exception to the warrant requirement.   He argues that the incriminating nature of the evidence was not immediately apparent to Deputy Fulmer.   McCarthy also contends that no credible evidence established that he owned the seized weapons or that they were actually found in his suitcase.   With respect to his second suitcase, McCarthy argues that the district court erred in finding that he had no expectation of privacy in the American Tourister suitcase.   McCarthy maintains that, though he left the suitcase in Henderson's trailer, he left it closed and locked.   Moreover, he contends that he had not abandoned the suitcase because he intended to retrieve it later in the evening on the day of his arrest.   We find these arguments unpersuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To satisfy the \"plain view\" exception to the warrant requirement, the government must show that (1) the law enforcement agent was legally in a position to observe the seized evidence, and (2) the incriminating nature of the evidence was \"immediately apparent\" to the officer.   See United States v. Giannetta, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"545477\"><a href=\"/opinion/545477/united-states-v-james-william-giannetta/\"><span class=\"volume\">909</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">571</span></a></span>, 578 (1st Cir.1990).   The incriminating nature of the evidence is \"immediately apparent,\" if the officer, upon observing the evidence, has probable cause to believe the item is contraband or evidence of a crime.  Id.  \"A practical nontechnical probability that incriminating evidence is involved is all that is required.\"  Texas v. Brown, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110901\"><a href=\"/opinion/110901/texas-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">730</span></a></span>, 742, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110901\"><a href=\"/opinion/110901/texas-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span> (1983) (quotations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While it is true that the district court failed to make an explicit finding on the \"immediately apparent\" prong, the oversight matters little in the context of this case.   Deputy Fulmer knew that McCarthy, along with Hunter, was a suspect in a series of armed bank robberies.   Without question, the automatic weapons, ammunition and bullet-proof vest were all potential instrumentalities of such crimes.   We think a finding that the incriminating nature of the evidence was immediately apparent to Fulmer, implicit in the district court's refusal to suppress the weapons and other items seized from the suitcase, is clearly supported by the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also find little merit in McCarthy's contention that no credible evidence established that he owned the weapons and other items seized or that they were actually in his suitcase prior to its being opened.   As an initial matter, we note that McCarthy's contention is more appropriately considered as an attack on the relevancy of the seized weapons rather than a fourth amendment issue.   If, as McCarthy contends, he did not own the weapons and did not store them in his suitcase, then the seizure does not violate his fourth amendment rights because it did not intrude on his privacy.   See Sanchez, 943 F.2d at 112-13 (Fourth Amendment rights are personal).   On the other hand, if McCarthy's allegation that he did not own or possess the weapons and other items is true, then they would not have been relevant as evidence in his criminal trial.   See Fed.R.Evid. 401 (evidence is relevant if it tends to make a disputed fact more or less probable).   When, as here, the relevancy of specific evidence turns on a condition of fact--whether the suitcase actually contained the seized weapons and other items--a court shall admit it subject to the introduction of evidence sufficient to fulfill that condition.   Fed.R.Evid. 104(b);  United States v. Trenkler, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196186\"><a href=\"/opinion/196186/united-states-v-trenkler/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 53 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Gene Ellison, the person who purportedly cut the lock off the maroon suitcase, did not testify at the suppression hearing, we think the evidence adequately supports the conclusion that the items seized were in the suitcase prior to its opening.   Henderson testified that, although Ellison took the padlock off the suitcase while he was in the other room, he, not Ellison, rummaged through the suitcase and found the weapons and the bulletproof vest.   Moreover, Henderson testified that the suitcase was extremely heavy and that he needed Ellison's assistance to move it from the back room of his trailer.   These facts reasonably support the inference that the weapons and other items were in the suitcase prior to Ellison's removal of the lock.   Furthermore, that the items were in the suitcase, reasonably supports the inference that they belonged to McCarthy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we find no clear error in the court's finding that McCarthy had no legitimate expectation of privacy in the contents of the American Tourister suitcase.   Based on Henderson's testimony, the district court supportably found that McCarthy left the suitcase unlocked and open in the back room of Henderson's trailer, a room to which McCarthy did not have exclusive access.   Thus, McCarthy clearly had assumed the risk that Henderson might consent to a search of the room (and that the search would extend to any items, like the suitcase, sitting open in plain view).   See, e.g., United States v. Hall, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"594435\"><a href=\"/opinion/594435/united-states-v-henry-w-hall/\"><span class=\"volume\">979</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span>, 79 (6th Cir.1992), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">947</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">736</span></span> (1993).   Moreover, McCarthy's legitimate expectation argument is further undercut by the fact that he left the open suitcase in Henderson's trailer after Henderson told McCarthy that he and Hunter had to leave.   Cf. United States v. Rahme, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"484266\"><a href=\"/opinion/484266/united-states-v-riad-youssef-rahme/\"><span class=\"volume\">813</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 34-35 (2d Cir.1987) (hotel guest had no expectation of privacy in luggage left in room when, because of his arrest, he defaulted on rent due).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Sentencing Issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now turn to the issues Hunter and McCarthy raise concerning their respective sentences.   Hunter complains that the district court unfairly sentenced him to a mandatory five-year sentence under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) while simultaneously enhancing his total offense level for brandishing a firearm during and in relation to the Connecticut and Alabama robberies.   Hunter also contends that the district court erroneously ordered his entire federal sentence to run consecutively to his unexpired state sentence.   McCarthy contends that the district court incorrectly sentenced him as an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e).

Hunter's Sentencing Issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p>a. Brandishing Enhancement</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 2K2.4 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides, inter alia, that a person convicted under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment as required by the statute.   U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.4(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  In turn, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) specifies that any individual convicted of using a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence or a drug trafficking crime shall be sentenced to a mandatory term of at least five years in prison to be served consecutively to any other punishment.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c).   Application Note 2 to U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.4 adds that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p>Where a sentence under [&#167; 2K2.4] is imposed in conjunction with a sentence for an underlying offense, any specific offense characteristic for the possession, use, or discharge of an explosive or firearm ... is not to be applied in respect to the guideline for the underlying offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.4, comment.  (n. 2).   Thus, where a defendant receives a mandatory consecutive sentence for use of a firearm during a crime of violence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c), a court should not also enhance the defendant's base offense level for the underlying crime of violence to account for the use of the firearm.   Id.;  see also U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.1, comment.  (n. 1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district court treated, for sentencing purposes, the conspiracy to commit the Alabama, Connecticut and Maine bank robberies in Count One as three separate counts of conspiracy to commit the three separate bank robberies.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.2(d) (\"A conviction on a count charging a conspiracy to commit more than one offense shall be treated as if the defendant had been convicted on a separate count of conspiracy for each offense that the defendant conspired to commit.\").   Accordingly, the court calculated a separate base offense level for each conspiracy and then combined these levels together to produce a single total offense level.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.4.   In calculating the separate base offense levels for the conspiracies to commit the Alabama and the Connecticut robberies, the district court--in both instances--applied a five-level enhancement for brandishing a firearm.   U.S.S.G. &#167; 2B3.1(b)(2)(C).   Because the &#167; 924(c) charge related to the Maine bank robbery, however, the district court did not apply the brandishing enhancement when calculating the base offense level for that conspiracy.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.4, comment.  (n. 2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hunter contends that the district court erred in its calculation, contending that it should not have separated the Alabama and Connecticut robberies from the Maine robbery in determining whether to apply the brandishing enhancement.   Hunter argues that Application Note 2 to &#167; 2K2.4 clearly states that where the &#167; 924(c) sentence is imposed \"in conjunction with a sentence for the underlying offense\" no enhancement may be applied, and, in this case, the underlying offense was collectively the entire conspiracy to commit the three bank robberies.   Therefore, Hunter concludes, the district court should not have applied the brandishing enhancement to the conspiracies to commit the Alabama and Connecticut robberies because they were part of the \"underlying offense.\"   We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We decline Hunter's invitation to read the phrase \"the underlying offense\" in Application Note 2 to preclude the application of the brandishing enhancements to the conspiracies to commit the Alabama and Connecticut robberies.   First, &#167; 1B1.2(d) clearly instructs the sentencing court to treat a count charging a conspiracy to commit multiple offenses as separate counts of conspiracy for each offense the defendant conspired to commit.   U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.2(d);  see also U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.2, comment.  (n. 8).   Thus, it is clear that the Sentencing Commission does not consider, for the purposes of applying the guidelines, a conspiracy to commit multiple offenses as constituting one single integrated offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the district court's application of the brandishing enhancement does not undercut the purposes of Note 2.   Application Note 2 is intended to prevent double counting.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.4, comment.  (backg'd) (\"To avoid double counting, when a sentence under this section is imposed in conjunction with a sentence for an underlying offense, any specific offense characteristic for explosive or firearm discharge, use, or possession is not applied in respect to such underlying offense.\").   In this case, no double counting occurred.   Hunter's conviction under &#167; 924(c) was for using or carrying the firearm during and in relation to the Maine robbery, and the district court carefully eschewed applying the brandishing enhancement when calculating the offense level for Hunter's conspiracy to commit that offense.   The court applied the brandishing enhancement only when calculating the offense levels relating to the Alabama and Connecticut robberies.   Thus, the same conduct did not unfairly give rise to both a sentencing enhancement and a separate mandatory sentence under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p>b. Consecutive or Concurrent Sentences</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1988, Hunter pled guilty in Connecticut state court to possession of cocaine with intent to sell.   As a result, he was sentenced to a term of ten years in state prison.   After serving three years, the balance of Hunter's sentence was suspended and he was released on three years probation.   Hunter was still on probation at the time of the Franklin robbery.   Shortly after the Franklin robbery occurred, an order charging Hunter with violation of probation was issued, and, ultimately, on November 16, 1993, a Connecticut state court revoked Hunter's probation and sentenced him to seven-years imprisonment (apparently the unexpired portion of his suspended ten-year sentence for cocaine possession).   At the time of sentencing in this case, Hunter was serving the remainder of his Connecticut prison term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At Hunter's federal sentencing, the district court ruled that his entire federal sentence should run consecutively to his state sentence.   In so ruling, the court relied on U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3(c), which provides that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p>the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run consecutively to the prior undischarged term of imprisonment to the extent necessary to achieve a reasonable incremental punishment for the instant offense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court effectively held that, because the state sentence stemmed not just from the underlying cocaine offense but also from the separate probation violation, the federal sentence should run consecutively to the state sentence in order to insure the necessary incremental punishment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Hunter contends that, in applying subsection (c) and sentencing Hunter to a wholly consecutive federal sentence, the district court erred because it failed to follow the method outlined in Application Note 3 to &#167; 5G1.3 for calculating the appropriate incremental punishment.   Note 3 provides that:[t]o the extent practicable, the court should consider a reasonable incremental penalty to be a sentence for the instant offense that results in a combined sentence of imprisonment that approximates the total punishment that would have been imposed under &#167; 5G1.2 (Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction) had all of the offenses been federal offenses for which sentences were being imposed at the same time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3, comment.  (n. 3) (emphasis added);  see also United States v. Whiting, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"673817\"><a href=\"/opinion/673817/united-states-v-darryl-whiting-aka-g-god-rah-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1296</span></a></span>, 1310-11 (1st Cir.1994) (plain error for sentencing court to impose federal sentence wholly consecutive to state sentence without attempting to compute the proper equivalent total punishment called for by Note 3).   Thus, Hunter contends that, before sentencing him to a wholly consecutive sentence, the district court should have calculated the sentence he would have received if the revocation of probation and the instant bank robbery offenses had all been federal offenses for which he was sentenced at the same time.   We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, as noted, &#167; 5G1.3(c) instructs the district court, in cases where it applies, to sentence defendants to consecutive sentences \"to the extent necessary to achieve a reasonable incremental punishment.\"   Then, Application Note 3 prescribes a method for calculating the \"reasonable incremental punishment\" that we have recognized applies in \"a good many of the cases likely to arise under subsection (c).\"  United States v. Gondek, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196276\"><a href=\"/opinion/196276/united-states-v-gondek/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.1995).   Implicit in this recognition, however, is the fact that, although the method applies in a \"good many cases,\" it does not cover every case.   Indeed, as Application Note 3 itself explains, the methodology it prescribes is intended only \"to assist the court in determining the appropriate sentence.\"   U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3, comment.  (n. 3);  cf. id.  (cautioning that method should be followed only \"[t]o the extent practicable\").   Therefore, while it is evident that a sentencing court should initially look to Note 3 for guidance in calculating an appropriate incremental punishment, it nonetheless has discretion to follow a different course in a small number of cases where adherence to Note 3 would be impracticable and result in an inappropriate incremental punishment.   See, e.g., United States v. Brassell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"691069\"><a href=\"/opinion/691069/united-states-v-jay-c-brassell/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span>, 278 (7th Cir.1995) (court has discretion in appropriate circumstances to disregard methodology outlined in Note 3), United States v. Torrez <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6812\"><a href=\"/opinion/6812/united-states-v-torrez/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span>, 87 (5th Cir.1994) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district court did not err by following a different course.   First, it is far from clear how, and if, Application Note 3 applies to the facts of this case.   None of the four detailed examples outlined in Note 3 explain how to sentence a defendant who is serving out a term following the revocation of probation.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3, comment.  (n. 3).   Moreover, the text of Note 3 instructs that the incremental punishment should be calculated according to the grouping rules set forth in &#167; 5G1.2.   Section 5G1.2 (and the other sections to which it refers), however, does not discuss how to handle a sentence imposed following a probation revocation.   The guidelines do discuss sentences imposed for probation violations separately under U.S.S.G. Ch. 7.   Significantly, Application Note 5 to U.S.S.G. &#167; 7B1.3 instructs that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p>it is the Commission's recommendation that any sentence of imprisonment for a criminal offense that is imposed after revocation of probation or supervised release be run consecutively to any term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 7B1.3, comment.  (n. 5) (emphasis added).   If anything, Note 5 suggests that the course followed by the district court, imposing a wholly consecutive sentence, was correct.   See Torrez, 40 F.3d at 87-88 (Section 7B1.3 suggests that--as in this case--notwithstanding Note 3 to &#167; 5G1.3, imposition of wholly consecutive sentence would be appropriate in case involving a probation revocation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, Application Note 3 fails to explain whether, in a situation like the present, a court should consider the underlying state drug conviction in calculating the equivalent federal sentence.   In his argument, Hunter ignores the underlying drug possession and contends that Note 3 requires the court to combine only the guideline sentence for federal probation revocation with the guideline sentence for the instant bank robbery charges.   Such an approach, however, fails to account for the fact that, in sentencing Hunter to the unexpired portion of his suspended ten-year drug sentence, the state court arguably aimed to punish Hunter for both the probation violation and the underlying cocaine possession.   Cf. United States v. Gullickson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596447\"><a href=\"/opinion/596447/united-states-v-harlan-brent-gullickson/\"><span class=\"volume\">981</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">344</span></a></span>, 346-47 (8th Cir.1992) (instructing sentencing court to calculate appropriate incremental punishment by estimating equivalent federal sentence for state forgery and other offenses and combining that with the sentence for instant federal offense where defendant, at the time of sentencing, was serving state prison term following revocation of probation imposed for state forgery conviction;  court notably did not instruct sentencing court to estimate federal penalty for probation violation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we note that Hunter's case is unlike the usual situation governed by &#167; 5G1.3(c), in which the offenses supporting the separate sentences arise from related conduct.   See Gondek, 65 F.3d at 3.   In such cases (e.g., a state drug charge and a related federal firearms charge), sentencing according to the grouping rules as suggested by Application Note 3 makes much sense.   In other words, when the federal sentence arises from conduct or acts directly related to that on which the state sentence is based, application of the guidelines' grouping rules accords with fairness principles inherent in the guidelines by \"limit[ing] the significance of the formal charging decision and ... prevent[ing] multiple punishment for substantially identical offense conduct.\"   U.S.S.G. Ch. 3 Pt. D, intro. comment.   Hunter's situation, however, is different.   The federal bank robbery convictions arise from conduct completely unrelated to the cocaine possession that lies at the heart of the state sentence.   In cases like Hunter's, where the acts or conduct giving rise to the different sentences are not closely related, the rationale of the guidelines' grouping rules does not apply.   Indeed, Hunter's situation is more \"closely akin to the case of the defendant who commits a new offense while still in prison, the very situation in which [U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3(a) ] instructs that the new sentence is to be served consecutively.\"  Gondek, 65 F.3d at 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we do not believe that the method for calculating a \"reasonable incremental punishment\" prescribed in Application Note 3 clearly addresses Hunter's situation.   In short, it would not have been \"practicable\" in light of the inconsistencies outlined above for the district court to have attempted to follow Note 3, and, thus, it did not err in failing to do so.   Moreover, we do not think the court otherwise abused its discretion in sentencing Hunter to a wholly consecutive federal sentence.   The court carefully considered the circumstances of this case and determined that such a sentence was necessary in order to insure a reasonable incremental punishment for the federal bank robbery charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, we believe the Sentencing Commission's adoption in 1993 of Application Note 4 to U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3 implicitly supports this conclusion.   In cases where a defendant has committed a federal offense while on probation, Note 4 expressly limits a district court's discretion in determining a reasonable incremental punishment by providing that the court must order the entire federal sentence to run consecutively to any sentence imposed upon revocation of probation.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3, comment.  (n. 4).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  Significantly, the Sentencing Commission added Note 4 to &#167; 5G1.3 without altering in any way the language of Application Note 3.   Thus, in doing so, the Commission implicitly recognized that, prior to the adoption of Note 4, a sentencing court at the very least had the discretion in cases like Hunter's (e.g., probation revocation cases) to ignore the methodology set forth in Note 3 and order a wholly consecutive sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. McCarthy's Sentencing Issue</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, McCarthy challenges the district court's use of his seven prior state attempted-murder convictions as a single predicate offense in determining whether he was subject to sentencing as an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C. 924(e).   McCarthy contends that the district court should not have considered the attempted-murder convictions because they arose out of the same incident that gave rise to a \"non-qualifying\" bank larceny conviction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the government explains, the sentencing court did not count the larceny conviction as a separate predicate offense, but instead counted only the state attempted-murder convictions (and the court counted those only as a single predicate offense).   Thus, the district court did not consider an arguably non-qualifying predicate offense (i.e., the bank larceny conviction) in determining whether it should sentence McCarthy as an armed career criminal.   McCarthy's implicit contention that, whenever the same conduct gives rise to both qualifying and non-qualifying convictions, a sentencing court may consider neither in determining whether defendant qualifies as an armed career criminal is completely without logic or support.   Accordingly, McCarthy's complaint lacks merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Trooper Heller obtained Lance Hall's driver's license number from the rental agency.

In any event, the district court's finding that Officer Richard properly acted in initially detaining Hunter after spotting him shortly after the robbery, driving a red Pontiac Sunbird, is eminently supportable.   The close proximity in both distance and time to the Franklin robbery combined with the fact that Hunter's car identically matched the description of the vehicle the suspects were reported to be driving are articulable and specific facts that clearly gave rise to the reasonable suspicion needed to justify the initial stop</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> In Michigan v.

Infante-Ruiz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195160\"><a href=\"/opinion/195160/united-states-v-infante/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">498</span></a></span>, 503 (1st Cir.1994) (\"[G]overnment bears burden of showing, by reference to 'demonstrated historical facts' and by a preponderance of the evidence, that the information or item would inevitably have been discovered by lawful means.\"), we think it likely that, in the normal course of the investigation, the government would have inevitably discovered James Hall.   Indeed, James Hall's brother, Lance, rented the Pontiac Sunbird.   Trooper Heller obtained this information and the fact that Hunter was listed as a driver on the rental agreement solely on the basis of the car's license plate number.   It is true that the record lacks any evidence clearly establishing that the police would have possessed the license plate number absent the stop, or that, during the normal course of the investigation, officers would have spoken to Lance Hall and necessarily have made the connection to his brother James.   Nonetheless, we do not think it is unduly speculative to infer that such events would have occurred.   Had the police spoken to Lance Hall, it is at least arguably reasonable that he would have directed them to his brother James, who also knew Hunter and lived in the vicinity of the Franklin robbery</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> McCarthy also challenges the search of his Isuzu pickup truck, arguing that it was the fruit of his illegal arrest and the illegal search of his maroon suitcase.   Because we find no error in either his initial arrest or the search of the suitcase, we find no error in the search of the truck.   Furthermore, we also reject McCarthy's final challenge concerning the search of his storage shed in Maine because it is likewise substantially predicated on the assumption that the earlier arrest and seizures were illegal</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> All guidelines' citations, unless otherwise indicated, are to the November 1994 Guidelines Manual, the manual in effect on the date of sentencing.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.11</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> The district court correctly ruled that neither &#167; 5G1.3(a) or (b) governed Hunter's sentencing.   In relevant part, U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3 provides:</p>\n        <p>&#167; 5G1.3 Imposition of a Sentence on a Defendant Subject to an Undischarged Term of Imprisonment</p>\n        <p>(a) If the instant offense was committed while the defendant was serving a term of imprisonment (including work release, furlough, or escape status) or after sentencing for, but before commencing service of, such term of imprisonment, the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run consecutively to the undischarged term of imprisonment.</p>\n        <p>(b) If subsection (a) does not apply, and the undischarged term of imprisonment resulted from offense(s) that have been fully taken into account in the determination of the offense level for the instant offense, the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run concurrently to the undischarged term of imprisonment.</p>\n        <p>(c) (Policy Statement) In any other case, the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run consecutively to the prior undischarged term of imprisonment to the extent necessary to achieve a reasonable incremental punishment for the instant offense.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> In order to avoid any ex post facto concerns, the district court expressly declined to rely on Application Note 4, enacted November 1, 1993 (prior to sentencing but after the underlying criminal acts), which provides:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\">4</a>\n        <p> If the defendant was on federal or state probation, parole, or supervised release at the time of the instant offense, and has had such probation, parole, or supervised release revoked, the sentence for the instant offense should be imposed to be served consecutively to the term imposed for the violation of probation, parole, or supervised release in order to provide an incremental penalty for the violation of probation, parole, or supervised release (in accord with the policy expressed in &#167;&#167; 7B1.3 and 7B1.4)</p>\n        <p>U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3, comment.  (n. 4).   We also find it unnecessary to rely on Note 4, and, thus, do not consider whether it poses any significant ex post facto concerns.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e) provides, inter alia, that an individual shall be sentenced as an armed career criminal if he or she has violated 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g) (unlawful possession of a firearm) and has three previous convictions by any court for a violent felony, serious drug offense or both, committed on occasions different from one another.   In this case, the district court held that McCarthy's federal bank larceny conviction did not qualify as a violent felony.   We have no need to review that decision</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
