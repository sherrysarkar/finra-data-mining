Ryan Iron Works, Inc.\n\n(Ryan) petitions for review of an order of the National Labor Relations\n\nBoard (Board) finding violations of Sections 8(a)(3) and (5) of the\n\nNational Labor Relations Act (Act), 29 U.S.C. §§ 158(a)(3) and (5).\n\nThe Board has cross-applied for enforcement of its order in which it\n\nfound that Ryan had committed a series of unfair labor practices during\n\nnegotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the\n\nbargaining representative of its employees, Shopmen’s Local 501,\n\nInternational Association of Bridge, Structural and Ornamental\n\nIronworkers, AFL-CIO (the Union), and that an economic strike of its\n\nemployees was converted into an unfair labor practice strike following\n\nan incident of direct dealing between Ryan’s president and one of its\n\nworkers. We affirm the Board’s order with respect to the unfair labor\n\npractices but hold that the record lacks substantial support for the\n\nfinding that the strike was converted prior to its termination on\n\nDecember 8, 1995. Accordingly, we grant the Board’s application in\n\npart only.\n\n                         FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n          Ryan is a corporation engaged in the fabrication of iron,\n\nsteel and metal products at its plant in Raynham, Massachusetts. It\n\nhas been party to a series of CBAs with Local 501 for more than twenty-\n\nfive years. The most recent CBA between the parties was in effect from\n\nSeptember 11, 1992, to September 10, 1995. The events giving rise to\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fthis controversy occurred in the course of the negotiations for a\n\nsuccessor CBA.\n\n          The parties met in negotiations eight times from August 18\n\nto November 10, 1995. The Union presented a list of demands, including\n\nsignificant wage and benefits increases, and Ryan, in turn, proposed to\n\nreduce wages and benefits in several areas. At the August 29 session,\n\nUnion representative David Mortimer (Mortimer) told Ryan’s negotiating\n\nteam that the company’s proposal was “an insult and a piece of garbage”\n\nand that the Union “would not give up one cent” in givebacks or\n\nconcessions of any kind. Another Union official made a similar comment\n\nat the August 31 session, where Ryan offered to increase its pension\n\nand health insurance contributions, and reiterated that the Union would\n\nnot agree to any givebacks or concessions.\n\n          On September 7 the Union filed an unfair labor practice\n\ncharge against Ryan for failure to bargain in good faith, a charge that\n\nwas ultimately rejected by the Board. On September 8 the employees\n\nvoted to reject Ryan’s proposal.       Because of the pendency of the\n\ncharge, the Union told its members that a strike would be an unfair\n\nlabor practice strike as opposed to an economic strike, meaning that\n\nnone of them could be permanently replaced.1 The members took a strike\n\n\n\n     1\n      Unlike economic strikers, unfair labor practices strikers are\nentitled to reinstatement and back pay even if they have been replaced\nduring the strike. NLRB v. Harding Glass Co., Inc., 80 F.3d 7, 10 n.3\n(1st Cir. 1997).\n\n                                 -4-\n\fvote and went out on September 11, the day after the CBA expired. The\n\nparties continued to meet, however, and at the September 18 session the\n\nUnion modified its proposal, reducing both its hourly wage and pension\n\nfund contribution demands. Ryan rejected this proposal and on October\n\n2 countered with a proposal which included an increase in vacation time\n\nfor certain employees and the shoe allowance but enlarged its right to\n\nsubcontract unit work. The Union rejected this proposal but made a\n\ncounterproposal for a three-year contract providing for increased wages\n\nand pension contributions.\n\n          On October 23, Ryan’s president, Howard Shea (Shea), invited\n\nWallace Penniman (Penniman), who was walking the picket line with\n\ntwenty to thirty other striking employees, to take a ride to inspect\n\none of Ryan’s construction jobs. Penniman agreed and the two men drove\n\noff. The parties dispute much of the content of the conversation\n\nduring that car trip. According to Penniman, Shea stated “that it was\n\nthe Union’s fault [that negotiations were going poorly] because they\n\nweren’t negotiating with the Company” and asked what exactly the men\n\nwanted.   Penniman told Shea that the employees’ main concern was\n\nseniority, and Shea responded that Ryan’s proposal on seniority was\n\nmerely a bargaining tool or a smokescreen to gain concessions. Shea\n\ntold Penniman “that [Ryan] was going to need another three-year pay\n\nfreeze to be competitive with the non-union shops.” The two men then\n\ndiscussed the possible pay freeze, as well as vacations, holidays, work\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fboot allowances, subcontracting, pensions, health insurance and\n\narbitration. According to Penniman, the discussion was extensive,\n\nlasting the entire drive to Waltham and back, a trip of about three\n\nhours. Before dropping him off, Shea told Penniman that this was the\n\ntype of negotiating he was hoping for from the Union and said that\n\nthere were only a few items on Ryan’s list that it needed. As Penniman\n\ngot out of the car at the picket line, Shea told him “not to worry\n\nabout it, that it was going to be resolved.”\n\n          In his testimony, Shea admitted that he told Penniman that\n\nthe Union had refused to respond to any of the company’s proposals but\n\ndenied that there was any substantive discussion of Ryan’s bargaining\n\nproposals.   According to Shea, when Penniman asked him about the\n\nnegotiations, Shea told him they should not discuss them.\n\n          The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) accepted Penniman’s\n\nversion of the conversation and found that Shea had dealt directly with\n\nan individual employee concerning the negotiations, thereby unlawfully\n\nbypassing and undermining the Union.\n\n          Penniman testified that the conversation led him to feel\n\noptimistic about the possibility of a quick resolution and that he\n\nshared it with the other picketers who saw him leave and return with\n\nShea. Later that day he told Union representative Mortimer about the\n\nconversation and Mortimer arranged for another negotiating session on\n\nOctober 25. The parties dispute whether the Union brought up the\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fShea/Penniman conversation at that session. Ryan argues that there was\n\nno mention of the incident and Mortimer testified as much, but Union\n\nnegotiator James Devlin testified that when he raised the question of\n\nthe differences between the positions taken by Ryan at the table and\n\nthose taken away from the table he was referring in part to the\n\nShea/Penniman incident. In any case, Ryan did not change its position.\n\nWhen Union officials reported this to the employees, the employees\n\nreacted with disappointment and anger. Having been led to believe that\n\nan early resolution was in the offing, some blamed the Union for the\n\nlack of progress.\n\n           On November 6 Ryan unilaterally altered the terms of\n\nemployment by implementing the changes in the CBA set out in its\n\nOctober 2 proposal. On November 10 it also discontinued contributions\n\nto the National Shopmen Pension Fund (Fund) required under the expired\n\nCBA. At the final negotiating session on that same day, the Union\n\nmodified its earlier proposal and accepted some of Ryan’s proposals.\n\nRyan rejected the Union proposal and stood on its October 2 proposal.\n\nOn November 16 the Union withdrew its previous proposal and offered a\n\nthree-year extension of the expired contract with several wage freeze\n\nconcessions. On November 21 Ryan rejected that proposal but told the\n\nUnion that it was willing to meet to “discuss the significant\n\ndifferences between them.”\n\n          On December 7 Ryan received a petition signed by fifty-five\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\femployees stating that they no longer wished to be represented by the\n\nUnion and it notified the Union that it was therefore withdrawing\n\nrecognition from the Union. On December 8 the Union voted to end the\n\nstrike and faxed Ryan a letter offering the return of all striking\n\nworkers to their jobs by December 11. When the workers showed up they\n\nwere met by Shea, who told them there were no jobs for them.\n\n                         STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n          We   grant   the   Board    “deference   with   regard   to its\n\ninterpretation of the Act as long as its interpretation is rational and\n\nconsistent with the statute.” NLRB v. Beverly Enters.-Mass., Inc., 174\n\nF.3d 13, 22 (1st Cir. 1999).         “The Board’s findings of fact are\n\nconclusive if supported by substantial evidence on the record\n\nconsidered as a whole.” Id. at 21. Substantial evidence is “such\n\nrelevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\n\nsupport a conclusion.” Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474,\n\n477 (1951) (citation omitted). The ultimate question is “ <whether on\n\nthis record it would have been possible for a reasonable jury to reach\n\nthe Board’s conclusion.’” NLRB v. Hosp. of San Pablo, Inc., 207 F.3d\n\n67, 70 (1st Cir. 2000) (quoting Allentown Mack Sales & Svc., Inc. v.\n\nNLRB, 522 U.S. 359, 366-67 (1998)).\n\nI.   THE DIRECT DEALING CHARGE\n\n     A.   The Unfair Labor Practice Charge\n\n          The Board accepted the ALJ’s finding that Shea’s discussion\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fwith Penniman was a violation of Section 8(a)(5), which prohibits\n\nemployers from bypassing the Union and dealing directly with employees.\n\nRyan initially attacks the ALJ’s credibility determination, which was\n\nbased principally on the relative demeanor of the witnesses and\n\naffirmed by the Board.2 That determination is entitled to great weight\n\nbecause the ALJ saw and heard the witnesses testify, see Holyoke\n\nVisiting Nurses Ass'n v. NLRB, 11 F.3d 302, 308 (1st Cir. 1993), and we\n\nwill not disturb it so long as the ALJ's position represents a choice\n\nbetween two fairly conflicting views. We will set aside such findings\n\nonly if we believe that the ALJ overstepped the bounds of reason. Id.;\n\n3-E Co., Inc. v. NLRB, 26 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1994). While the ALJ’s\n\nfinding may have been somewhat conclusory, we see nothing in the record\n\nto suggest that it was unreasonable.\n\n           Ryan next contends that even if Penniman’s testimony is\n\ncredited, the conversation he describes is not sufficient to establish\n\na direct dealing violation. Section 8(a)(5) of the Act imposes a duty\n\non an employer to bargain collectively with its employees’ chosen\n\nrepresentative. This obligation is exclusive and Section 9(a) of the\n\nAct, 29 U.S.C. § 159(a), accordingly “exacts <the negative duty to treat\n\n\n\n     2\n      The ALJ gave three reasons for believing Penniman over Shea, only\none of which was adopted by the Board: Penniman’s demeanor. The other\ntwo were: (1) the ALJ’s incorrect belief that Penniman was no longer a\nRyan employee or a Union member and therefore had no stake in his\ntestimony, and (2) his assumption that Shea would not take a striking\nworker from the picket line for a drive and not mention the strike.\n\n                                  -9-\n\fwith no other.’” Medo Photo Supply Corp. v. NLRB, 321 U.S. 678, 684\n\n(1944) (quoting NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U.S. 1, 44\n\n(1937)). “[O]rderly collective bargaining requires that the employer\n\nbe not permitted to go behind the designated representatives, in order\n\nto bargain with the employees themselves. . . .” Id. at 685. “The\n\nfundamental inquiry in a direct dealing case is whether the employer\n\nhas chosen <to deal with the Union through the employees, rather than\n\nwith the employees through the Union.’” NLRB v. Pratt Whitney Air\n\nCraft Div., 789 F.2d 121, 134 (2d Cir. 1986) (citation omitted).\n\n          The Board found that Shea’s discussion with Penniman amounted\n\nto direct dealing because “[Shea] told Penniman that it was the Union’s\n\nfault because they [sic] were not negotiating with the Company, asked\n\nPenniman what the employees wanted, and sought to minimize [Ryan’s]\n\nbargaining demands.” Ryan contends that the Board erroneously applied\n\nthe law and that Shea’s comments were merely an attempt to inform\n\nemployees about the course of the negotiations and Ryan’s position.\n\nSee United Technologies Corp., 275 NLRB 1069, 1074 (1985) (“[A]n\n\nemployer has a fundamental right, protected by Section 8© of the Act,\n\nto communicate with its employees concerning its position in collective\n\nbargaining negotiations and the course of those negotiations.”). Ryan\n\ncharacterizes the incident as simply conversation about proposals which\n\nhad already been submitted to the Union and encouragement to press\n\nUnion officials to start talking to management. Although Ryan concedes\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fthat Shea blamed the Union for the lack of progress, it argues that\n\nShea never encouraged Penniman to abandon the Union in order to achieve\n\na better deal.\n\n          While an employer may communicate or clarify its position to\n\nemployees, Shea, even if he did not encourage abandonment of the Union,\n\nwent well beyond what is permissible. Shea told Penniman that the\n\nfailure of negotiations was the Union’s fault and actively solicited\n\nPenniman’s input on “what exactly . . . the men want.”            Such\n\nsolicitation allows an employer to gain intelligence on employees’\n\nviews and to gauge the level of support for a particular position,\n\nundermining the chosen representative’s exclusive right to perform\n\nthese functions. See Alexander Linn Hosp. Ass’n, 288 NLRB 103, 106\n\n(1988), enforced, NLRB v. Wallkill Valley Gen. Hosp., 866 F.2d 632 (3d\n\nCir. 1989); NLRB v. M.A. Harrison Mfg. Co., 682 F.2d 580, 581-82 (6th\n\nCir. 1982) (enforcing Board order against employer for bypassing Union\n\nby directly soliciting employee views on an insurance plan). Shea,\n\nthrough Penniman, obtained information about the employees’ views on\n\nseniority, holidays, vacation time, a 401K plan, health insurance, a\n\nwork boot allowance and subcontracting. This is a virtual laundry list\n\nof the issues Ryan and the Union were covering in negotiations.\n\n          Contrary to Ryan’s contentions, Shea’s comments on these\n\nsubjects went beyond merely clarifying the proposals the company had\n\nalready submitted to the Union. For instance, he told Penniman that\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fseveral of Ryan’s stated positions were smokescreens, and that Ryan\n\nonly intended to take away two holidays rather than the five it\n\ndemanded at the bargaining table. Additionally, his subsequent comment\n\nto Penniman that, “that’s what we’re looking for, that kind of\n\nnegotiating,” implies that he was attempting to negotiate with the\n\nemployees through Penniman. Rather than “merely communicat[ing] what\n\nwas already before the Union in a proper exercise of [Ryan’s] free\n\nspeech rights,” Shea sought feedback from an employee to strengthen\n\nRyan’s position in the negotiations. Cf. Americare Pine Lodge Nursing\n\nand Rehab. Ctr. v. NLRB, 164 F.3d 867, 877 (4th Cir. 1999). That Shea\n\npicked Penniman up at the crowded picket line and three hours later\n\ndropped him off where other employees would notice and ask questions\n\nreinforces this conclusion.\n\n          This case thus bears no resemblance to Americare Pine Lodge\n\nNursing and Rehabilitation Center v. NLRB, 164 F.3d at 878-79, on which\n\nRyan relies. There, a supervisor asked a bargaining unit employee\n\nduring a smoking break what she thought of a recent employer proposal,\n\nthe employee responded that it “sounded good, but that it was only made\n\nto get rid of the Union,” and the conversation went no further. Id. at\n\n878. The court held that “[n]o reasonable person could conclude that\n\nthis brief exchange eroded the Union’s position as the exclusive\n\nbargaining representative.” Id. Shea’s three-hour discussion with\n\nPenniman was more than this “casual conversation.” Id. Shea actively\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fsolicited Penniman’s views, made new proposals, and, at least with\n\nrespect to the subcontracting issue, questioned Penniman as to how the\n\ncompany’s offer could be improved.       Id. at 879.\n\n          In sum, substantial evidence supports the Board’s finding\n\nthat Shea’s October 23 conversation with Penniman violated Section\n\n8(a)(5) of the Act.\n\n     B.   Conversion\n\n          “A strike begun in support of economic objectives becomes an\n\nunfair labor practice strike when the employer commits an intervening\n\nunfair labor practice which is found to make the strike last longer\n\nthan it otherwise would have.” Soule Glass and Glazing Co. v. NLRB,\n\n652 F.2d 1055, 1079 (1st Cir. 1981). Not every unfair labor practice\n\nwill convert a strike, however. We have held that “[c]ausation is\n\ncrucial: <It must be found not only that the employer committed an\n\nunfair labor practice after the commencement of the strike, but that as\n\na result the strike was “expanded to include a protest over [the]\n\nunfair labor practice[],” and that settlement of the strike was thereby\n\ndelayed and the strike prolonged.’” Harding Glass, 80 F.3d at 10\n\n(quoting Soule Glass, 652 F.2d at 1079-80). The General Counsel bears\n\nthe burden of establishing that “the unlawful conduct was a factor (not\n\nnecessarily the sole or predominate one) that caused a prolongation of\n\nthe work stoppage.” C-Line Express, 292 NLRB 638 (1989). The Board\n\nmay consider both objective and subjective evidence in assessing\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fwhether the General Counsel has met this burden:\n\n          Applying objective criteria, the Board and\n          reviewing court may properly consider the\n          probable impact of the type of unfair labor\n          practice in question on reasonable strikers in\n          the relevant context.     Applying subjective\n          criteria, the Board and court may give\n          substantial weight to the strikers’ own\n          characterization of their motive for continuing\n          to strike after the unfair labor practice.\n\nSoule Glass, 652 F.2d at 1080.\n\n          The ALJ found that Shea’s activity did not convert the strike\n\nbecause there was no evidence that the employees continued to strike\n\nbecause of it. A majority of the Board disagreed, finding that the\n\nstrike had been converted because the unlawful effort to bypass the\n\nUnion’s representatives “could not help but prevent and inhibit good-\n\nfaith bargaining, thereby prolonging the strike.” It further found\n\nthis objective inference to be supported by subjective evidence of the\n\ndivisive effect of this conduct on the strikers and their union\n\nnegotiators. Board Member Hurtgen dissented, finding that there was no\n\nevidence that the single, isolated incident of direct dealing had a\n\ndeleterious impact on subsequent negotiations or that it prolonged the\n\nstrike.\n\n          The Board has in the past recognized that:\n\n          the presence or absence of evidence of\n          [employees’] subjective motivation has not always\n          been the sine qua non for determining whether\n          there has been a conversion. Certain types of\n          unfair labor practices by their nature will have\n\n\n                                -14-\n\f          a reasonable tendency to prolong the strike and\n          therefore afford a sufficient and independent\n          basis for finding conversion. The most notable\n          examples typically involve an unlawful withdrawal\n          of recognition which may be accompanied by a\n          course of other unlawful conduct, including\n          withdrawal of contract proposals, refusals to\n          meet and bargain, and recognition of another\n          union. The common thread running through these\n          cases is the judgment of the Board that the\n          employer’s    conduct    is   likely    to   have\n          significantly interrupted or burdened the course\n          of the bargaining process.\n\nC-Line Express, 292 NLRB at 639. See also Harding Glass, 80 F.3d at 11\n\n(citing SKS Die Casting & Machining, Inc. v. NLRB, 941 F.2d 984, 991\n\n(9th Cir. 1991) (refusal to reinstate strikers); Vulcan Hart Corp. (St.\n\nLouis Div.) v. NLRB, 718 F.2d 269, 276 (8th Cir. 1983) (withdrawal of\n\nrecognition)).    But, as we said in Harding Glass:\n\n          Always, however, the principal focus must remain\n          on the element of causation, and specific,\n          subjective evidence of changed motivation may be\n          foregone only in those instances in which the\n          objective factors by themselves establish\n          unequivocally that a conversion occurred.\n\n80 F.3d at 12. Here, the Board relies on what it calls an “objective\n\ninference” that Shea’s conduct prolonged the strike, but it cites no\n\nobjective evidence and we agree with the ALJ that “there is simply no\n\nevidence that the employees continued to strike because of Shea’s\n\nactivity.”   Nor do the decisions in Safeway Trails, 233 NLRB 1078\n\n(1977), enforced, 641 F.2d 930 (D.C. Cir. 1979), and Beaumont Glass\n\nCo., 310 NLRB 710 (1993), on which the Board relied, support its\n\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fdecision.\n\n            The Board has in another context described Safeway Trails as\n\ninvolving “an egregious effort by the employer to obtain the employees’\n\nrepudiation of their union representative as a precondition to revoking\n\na collective bargaining agreement.” Forest Grove Lumber Co., 275 NLRB\n\n1007, 1007 n.1 (1985). There, the employer had engaged in repeated\n\noral and written communications with employees and others clearly\n\nintended to undermine the status and authority of the union’s chosen\n\nbargaining representative in violation of Section 8(a)(5). These\n\nefforts to undermine the union representative were well known to the\n\nemployees and were discussed at meetings of the union membership. The\n\nBoard found that:\n\n            Under these circumstances, the inference is clear\n            that the Respondent’s actions and communications\n            served to aggravate and prolong the strike. The\n            fact that the Respondent was not successful in\n            undercutting [the Union representative] does not\n            negate our finding that the Respondent’s\n            misconduct was a concern to employees and a\n            factor in the prolongation of the strike.\n            Moreover, the very nature of the Respondent’s\n            misconduct--appealing directly to employees in an\n            attempt to undercut the union representative--is\n            such as could not help but prevent and inhibit\n            good-faith bargaining, thereby prolonging the\n            strike.\n\nSafeway Trails, 233 NLRB at 1082.\n\n            The instant case--involving a single incident which had no\n\ndiscernible impact on the ongoing bargaining process--bears no\n\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\fresemblance to Safeway Trails.          Nor does it bear even remote\n\nresemblance to Beaumont Glass, where conversion was found on evidence\n\nthat: the employer sent a memorandum to the membership of the union\n\nwith a proposal which had not previously been made at the bargaining\n\ntable; the employees complained to the union representative when he\n\ntold them the proposal would not be put to a vote; the representative\n\ntestified that “the publication and distribution of the memorandum\n\ndestroyed the negotiations” and that no meaningful negotiating sessions\n\nwere held subsequently; and the union changed the language on its\n\npicket signs to signify it was protesting the employer’s unfair labor\n\npractices. 310 NLRB at 719. No such evidence appears in this record.\n\nIndeed, if the Shea/Penniman incident was ever mentioned at the October\n\n25 negotiating session at all, it was at most a passing reference.3\n\nMortimer later testified that no progress was made during that session\n\nbecause “we both agreed that we were just making no changes. We were\n\nsticking to our proposal. . . . After a little discussion from both\n\nsides, it was obvious nothing was going to change. . . .” The incident\n\nwas apparently not mentioned at the October 30 session either and, as\n\nnoted above, the Union did not file an unfair labor practice charge\n\nregarding the incident until nearly six months later.\n\n          We find Forest Grove Lumber Company, 275 NLRB 1007, more\n\nclosely on point. There, the employer, during a strike, had several\n\n     3\n      See supra p. *, lines 93-99.\n\n                                 -17-\n\fdiscussions with employees about the status of negotiations, many quite\n\nsimilar to the Shea/Penniman conversation. Employees testified that\n\nthe vice president spoke to them about the company’s proposals, the\n\nstalemate in negotiations, and the union’s refusal to bargain, and\n\nsolicited their views on what it would take to get the strikers back to\n\nwork. One employee stated that the vice president told him that the\n\ncompany’s proposal was not a firm proposal, that everything was\n\nnegotiable, and that only by asking for more than what it wanted could\n\nthe company reach an agreement. In rejecting the General Counsel’s\n\ncontention that the strike had been converted, the Board said:\n\n          Safeway Trails involved the factual context of an\n          egregious effort by the employer to obtain the\n          employees’    repudiation     of   their   union\n          representative as a precondition to revoking a\n          collective-bargaining agreement. Consequently,\n          the unlawful conduct in Safeway Trails clearly\n          intruded on the bargaining process and “could not\n          help but” prolong the strike. In contrast, the\n          Respondent’s unlawful conduct here involved\n          solicitation of employees to urge their\n          representatives to soften the Union’s bargaining\n          demands, and there was no effort to repudiate\n          those bargaining representatives. The unfair\n          labor practices here did not have any inevitable\n          impact on bargaining that would necessarily cause\n          prolongation of the strike.\n\nId. at 1007 n.1.\n\n      Simply put, that the Shea/Penniman conversation may have raised\n\nhopes among employees for an early end to the strike--hopes that were\n\ndashed when negotiations resumed, leading to “consternation” among\n\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\femployees--does not support the conclusion that the strike was thereby\n\nprolonged. “The Board’s obligation is to provide some basis for an\n\ninference that, in the aftermath of the [unfair labor practice], the\n\nemployees were separately motivated by that act.” Harding Glass, 80\n\nF.3d at 12. It is clear that the strike was about economic issues and\n\nthere is no evidence that the strikers’ motivation changed, in whole or\n\nin part, on account of the Shea/Penniman incident.4         See Facet\n\nEnterprises, Inc. v. NLRB, 907 F.2d 963, 977 (10th Cir. 1990) (“[T]o\n\nsustain a finding of conversion, there must be some evidence in the\n\nrecord that the . . . employees reacted to information of Facet’s\n\ndirect dealing substantively in a fashion which aggravated or prolonged\n\nthe strike.”); see also F.L. Thorpe & Co., Inc. v. NLRB, 71 F.3d 282,\n\n288 (8th Cir. 1995) (holding it was error to base conversion finding on\n\n“caused consternation” test where evidence established strike remained\n\neconomically motivated); Gibson Greetings, Inc., 310 NLRB 1286, 1292\n\nn.5 (1993) (finding no conversion because “[a]lthough several strikers\n\ntestified that they were distressed by the [Company’s] letter, none\n\nsuggested that it was because of that letter that the strike continued,\n\n     4\n      The General Counsel did not brief the issue but contended at oral\nargument that the record was devoid of any evidence that the strikers\nwere separately motivated by the Shea/Penniman conversation because the\nALJ erroneously sustained Ryan’s objections to the necessary line of\nquestioning. However, because the General Counsel’s offer of proof,\nwhile it shows that the strikers were disturbed by the direct dealing,\nfails to establish that the strikers shifted the focus of their protest\nto include the Shea/Penniman incident and thereby prolonged the strike,\nwe find no prejudice.\n\n                                 -19-\n\fnor that the strikers discussed it collectively as a basis for\n\ncontinuing the strike.”), enforcement denied on other grounds, Gibson\n\nGreetings, Inc. v. NLRB, 53 F.3d 385 (D.C. Cir. 1995); Soule Glass,\n\n652 F.2d at 1082.\n\n           Thus, while we find no basis for disturbing the Board’s\n\ndetermination with regard to the direct dealing charge, our review of\n\nthe record persuades us that the finding of conversion on that basis is\n\nnot supported by substantial evidence.\n\nII.   THE UNILATERAL IMPLEMENTATION CHARGE\n\n      A.   The Unfair Labor Practice Charge\n\n           On November 6, when some cross-over employees began returning\n\nto work, Ryan implemented its October 2 contract proposal. The Board\n\ndetermined that this unilateral implementation was an unlawful labor\n\npractice and, further, that it converted the strike to an unfair labor\n\npractice strike.\n\n      “[A]n employer must bargain to impasse before making a unilateral\n\nchange” in terms and conditions of employment. Visiting Nurse Serv. of\n\nW. Mass., Inc. v. NLRB, 177 F.3d 52, 57 (1st Cir. 1999). “ <Impasse\n\noccurs when, after good faith bargaining, the parties are deadlocked so\n\nthat any further bargaining would be futile,’ i.e., when <there [is] no\n\nrealistic prospect that continuation of discussions at that time would\n\n. . . [be] fruitful.’” Beverly Enters.-Mass., 174 F.3d at 27 (citation\n\nomitted). Relevant factors include “ <[t]he bargaining history, the good\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\ffaith of the parties in the negotiations, the length of the\n\nnegotiations, the importance of the issue or issues as to which there\n\nis disagreement, [and] the contemporaneous understanding of the parties\n\nas to the state of negotiations.’” NLRB v. Charles D. Bonanno Linen\n\nServ., Inc., 630 F.2d 24, 35 n.24 (1st Cir. 1980) (citation omitted).\n\nWe have held in the past that the determination of whether the parties\n\nreached good-faith impasse is particularly well-suited to the expertise\n\nof the Board.    See Beverly Enters.-Mass., 174 F.3d at 27.\n\n           The Board found that although during the four months of\n\nnegotiations there had been “limited movement,” credible evidence\n\nshowed that Ryan had not been adamant on all its proposals. Both sides\n\nmade some concessions, and more importantly, Ryan never told the Union\n\nthat failure to agree on its proposal would result in deadlock or that\n\nthere was an impasse and that it would implement its proposals. See\n\nHotel Roanoke, 293 NLRB 182, 185 (1989) (“The failure of a party to\n\ncommunicate to the other party the paramount importance of the\n\nproposals presented at the bargaining table or to explain that a\n\nfailure to achieve concessions would result in a bargaining deadlock\n\nevidences the absence of a valid impasse.”). Nor is there evidence that\n\nwhen Ryan implemented its October 2 proposal, or at any time\n\nthereafter, a contemporaneous understanding existed between the parties\n\nthat talks were at an impasse. Indeed, the parties held a negotiating\n\nsession   with   a   federal   mediator   on   November   10,   after   the\n\n\n                                  -21-\n\fimplementation, and the Union offered additional concessions at that\n\ntime. And in a letter dated November 21, Ryan’s counsel stated that\n\nalthough the Union’s latest proposal was unacceptable, it was willing\n\nto meet and discuss “the Company’s outstanding offer of October 2nd.”\n\nRyan had the burden of proof on this issue and it failed to sustain it.\n\nSee PRC Recording Co., 280 NLRB 615, 635 (1986), enforced, Richmond\n\nRecording Corp. v. NLRB, 836 F.2d 289 (7th Cir. 1987).\n\n          Substantial evidence supports the Board’s finding that Ryan’s\n\nunilateral implementation of its October 2 proposal violated Section\n\n8(a)(5) of the Act.\n\n     B.   Conversion\n\n          The Board determined that this violation also converted the\n\nstrike, finding that “[i]n conjunction with Shea’s earlier bypass of\n\nthe Union, it can be inferred that [Ryan’s] unilateral changes were\n\nalso unfair labor practices that prolonged the strike.” The Board\n\nfound that the employees must have been aware of the implementation of\n\nthe October 2 proposal no later than November 11, when striking workers\n\nwould have noticed that cross-over and replacement employees were\n\nworking on Veterans Day, a holiday, and thus that there had been a\n\nunilateral change in the holiday policy.       However, as the Board\n\ndetermined earlier in its opinion, it was not unlawful for Ryan to\n\nimplement different terms of employment for striker replacements\n\nbecause struck employers have no obligation to bargain about terms of\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\femployment for replacements. See Detroit Newspaper Agency, 327 NLRB\n\n871 (1999); see also Service Electric Co., 281 NLRB 633 n.1 (1986)\n\n(because interests of returning economic strikers are more closely\n\naligned with those of the strike replacements than those of the\n\nstrikers, an employer has no greater duty to bargain during the strike\n\nover their terms of employment than it does over the strike\n\nreplacements’). Strikers observing workers at the plant that day would\n\ntherefore not necessarily have concluded that their presence meant that\n\nthe terms of the CBA had been unilaterally changed.\n\n          In   any   event,   the    Board’s   evidence   is,   at   best,\n\ncircumstantial (if not entirely speculative) proof that employees may\n\nhave known that a change had been made in the terms of (their)\n\nemployment. But it fails to satisfy “[t]he Board’s obligation . . . to\n\nprovide some basis for an inference that, in the aftermath of the\n\nimplementation, the employees were separately motivated by that act.”\n\nHarding Glass, 80 F.3d at 12. There is no objective or subjective\n\nevidence that the arrival of workers on a holiday motivated the\n\nstriking employees to prolong the strike or that it interfered with the\n\nbargaining process.\n\n          The Board’s finding of conversion is not supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence. See Beverly Enters.-Mass., 174 F.3d at 22 n.1\n\n(“Substantial evidence is not a rubber stamp.”).\n\nIII. WITHDRAWAL OF RECOGNITION\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\f            The Board found that on December 6 Ryan received a petition\n\nfrom some fifty-five cross-over and replacement workers (out of a total\n\nof ninety-five employees), stating that they did not want to be\n\nrepresented by the Union. On December 7 Ryan withdrew recognition\n\nbased on the petition.     On December 8 the Union advised that its\n\nmembers would unconditionally return to work on December 11. On that\n\ndate, Ryan declined to reinstate the strikers, although sometime later\n\nit offered reinstatement to all but twelve of the original sixty-one\n\nstrikers.    The Board found the withdrawal of recognition “in the\n\ncontext of unremedied unfair labor practices on December 7” to be a\n\nviolation of Section 8(a)(5).\n\n            During the term of a CBA, an incumbent union enjoys an\n\nirrebuttable presumption of majority employee support. See Auciello\n\nIron Works, Inc. v. NLRB, 517 U.S. 781, 786 (1996). Upon expiration of\n\nthe contract, the employer can rebut that presumption and withdraw\n\nrecognition if it can show either that the union in fact lacked\n\nmajority support or that the employer had a good faith, objectively\n\njustified doubt regarding the union’s majority.        See Destileria\n\nSerrales, Inc. v. NLRB, 882 F.2d 19, 20-21 (1st Cir. 1989). However,\n\nif an employer has “committed as yet unremedied unfair labor practices\n\nthat could have reasonably tended to contribute to employee\n\ndisaffection from the union,” it may not rely on employee expressions\n\nof disaffection, such as a petition, as a basis for withdrawal of\n\n\n                                  -24-\n\frecognition. United Supermarkets, Inc. v. NLRB, 862 F.2d 549, 553 n.6\n\n(5th Cir. 1989) (citing Chicago Magnesium Castings Co., 256 NLRB 668,\n\n674 (1981)); accord Bolton-Emerson, Inc. v. NLRB, 899 F.2d 104, 107-08\n\n(1st Cir. 1989) (“justified withdrawal [of recognition] requires . . .\n\na context free of unfair labor practices”); Soule Glass, 652 F.2d at\n\n1110.           The General Counsel must prove a causal relationship\n\nbetween unremedied unfair labor practices and the loss of majority\n\nstatus, but direct evidence showing actual taint is not required. See\n\nUnited Supermarkets, Inc., 862 F.2d at 552 n.5. It is sufficient that\n\nthe unfair labor practices would reasonably tend to cause employee\n\ndisaffection. See NLRB v. Hi-Tech Cable Corp., 128 F.3d 271, 279 (5th\n\nCir. 1997). Factors typically considered include: (1) the length of\n\ntime between the unfair labor practices and the withdrawal of\n\nrecognition; (2) the nature of the illegal acts, including the\n\npossibility of their detrimental or lasting effect on employees; (3)\n\nany possible tendency of the unfair labor practices to cause employee\n\ndisaffection from the union; and (4) the effect of the unlawful conduct\n\non employee morale, organizational activities, and membership in the\n\nunion. Master Slack Corp., 271 NLRB 78, 84 (1984). Here, the petition\n\nwas presented six weeks after the direct dealing incident and four\n\nweeks after the unlawful November 6 implementation, both violations of\n\na type that weaken the authority of a union and encourage employees to\n\ndoubt its ability to successfully represent them. While we think it is\n\n\n                                 -25-\n\fa close question, we conclude that the Board could reasonably consider\n\nthat these two unfair labor practices, particularly in combination,\n\n“significantly contributed” to the Union’s loss of majority status.\n\nWilliams Enters., Inc., 312 NLRB 937, 940 (1993), enforced, NLRB v.\n\nWilliams Enters., Inc., 50 F.3d 1280 (4th Cir. 1995). We therefore\n\naffirm the Board’s bargaining order.\n\n            Because the strike ended at approximately the same time as\n\nthe withdrawal of recognition (at least there is no evidence of any\n\nemployees being replaced on December 7 or 8), conversion is not an\n\nissue and we do not read the Board’s order as making a determination of\n\nconversion based on withdrawal of recognition. Because we reject the\n\nBoard’s determinations of conversion on October 23 or November 11, the\n\nstrikers are entitled only to the reinstatement rights of economic\n\nstrikers.    See Rose Printing Co., 289 NLRB 252, 253 (1988).\n\n                              CONCLUSION\n\n            We affirm the Board’s finding that the October 23\n\nShea/Penniman conversation and the November 6 unilateral implementation\n\nof Ryan’s bargaining proposal constituted unfair labor practices.\n\nFurther, we affirm the Board’s finding that these practices\n\n“significantly contributed” to the Union’s loss of majority status.\n\nConsequently, we affirm that portion of the Board’s remedial order\n\naimed at undoing the effects of these practices. This includes the\n\nprovisions of the order requiring Ryan to recognize and bargain with\n\n\n                                 -26-\n\fthe Union and, upon request, to rescind and compensate for the\n\nunilateral changes made on or after November 6, 1995 to the terms of\n\nemployment for bargaining unit employees. However, because we reject\n\nthe Board’s determinations of conversion, we deny enforcement of that\n\nportion of the Board’s order granting reinstatement and backpay to\n\nunfair labor practice strikers. Because we find that no conversion,\n\nand hence no unfair labor practice strike, occurred, this relief is no\n\nlonger apposite. Accordingly, the Board’s application for enforcement\n\nof its order is granted in part and denied in part.\n\n          GRANTED in part, DENIED in part.\n\n\n\n\n                                -27-\n\f",

(Ryan) petitions for review of an order of the National Labor Relations Board (Board) finding violations of Sections 8(a)(3) and (5) of the National Labor Relations Act (Act), 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167;&#167;&#167; 158(a)(3) and (5). The Board has cross-applied for enforcement of its order in which it found that Ryan had committed a series of unfair labor practices during negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the bargaining representative of its employees, Shopmen's Local 501, International Association of Bridge, Structural and Ornamental Ironworkers, AFL-CIO (the Union), and that an economic strike of its employees was converted into an unfair labor practice strike following an incident of direct dealing between Ryan's president and one of its workers. We affirm the Board's order with respect to the unfair labor practices but hold that the record lacks substantial support for the finding that the strike was converted prior to its termination on December 8, 1995. Accordingly, we grant the Board's application in part only.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ryan is a corporation engaged in the fabrication of iron, steel and metal products at its plant in Raynham, Massachusetts. It has been party to a series of CBAs with Local 501 for more than twenty-five years. The most recent CBA between the parties was in effect from September 11, 1992, to September 10, 1995. The events giving rise to this controversy occurred in the course of the negotiations for a successor CBA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties met in negotiations eight times from August 18 to November 10, 1995. The Union presented a list of demands, including significant wage and benefits increases, and Ryan, in turn, proposed to reduce wages and benefits in several areas. At the August 29 session, Union representative David Mortimer (Mortimer) told Ryan's negotiating team that the company's proposal was \"an insult and a piece of garbage\" and that the Union \"would not give up one cent\" in give backs or concessions of any kind. Another Union official made a similar comment at the August 31 session, where Ryan offered to increase its pension and health insurance contributions, and reiterated that the Union would not agree to any give backs or concessions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 7 the Union filed an unfair labor practice charge against Ryan for failure to bargain in good faith, a charge that was ultimately rejected by the Board. On September 8 the employees voted to reject Ryan's proposal. Because of the pendency of the charge, the Union told its members that a strike would be an unfair labor practice strike as opposed to an economic strike, meaning that none of them could be permanently replaced.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The members took a strike vote and went out on September 11, the day after the CBA expired. The parties continued to meet, however, and at the September 18 session the Union modified its proposal, reducing both its hourly wage and pension fund contribution demands. Ryan rejected this proposal and on October 2 countered with a proposal which included an increase in vacation time for certain employees and the shoe allowance but enlarged its right to subcontract unit work. The Union rejected this proposal but made a counterproposal for a three-year contract providing for increased wages and pension contributions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 23, Ryan's president, Howard Shea (Shea), invited Wallace Penniman (Penniman), who was walking the picket line with twenty to thirty other striking employees, to take a ride to inspect one of Ryan's construction jobs. Penniman agreed and the two men drove off. The parties dispute much of the content of the conversation during that car trip. According to Penniman, Shea stated \"that it was the Union's fault [that negotiations were going poorly] because they weren't negotiating with the Company\" and asked what exactly the men wanted. Penniman told Shea that the employees' main concern was seniority, and Shea responded that Ryan's proposal on seniority was merely a bargaining tool or a smokescreen to gain concessions. Shea told Penniman \"that [Ryan] was going to need another three-year pay freeze to be competitive with the non-union shops.\" The two men then discussed the possible pay freeze, as well as vacations, holidays, work boot allowances, subcontracting, pensions, health insurance and arbitration. According to Penniman, the discussion was extensive, lasting the entire drive to Waltham and back, a trip of about three hours. Before dropping him off, Shea told Penniman that this was the type of negotiating he was hoping for from the Union and said that there were only a few items on Ryan's list that it needed. As Penniman got out of the car at the picket line, Shea told him \"not to worry about it, that it was going to be resolved.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his testimony, Shea admitted that he told Penniman that the Union had refused to respond to any of the company's proposals but denied that there was any substantive discussion of Ryan's bargaining proposals. According to Shea, when Penniman asked him about the negotiations, Shea told him they should not discuss them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) accepted Penniman's version of the conversation and found that Shea had dealt directly with an individual employee concerning the negotiations, thereby unlawfully bypassing and undermining the Union.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Penniman testified that the conversation led him to feel optimistic about the possibility of a quick resolution and that he shared it with the other picketers who saw him leave and return with Shea. Later that day he told Union representative Mortimer about the conversation and Mortimer arranged for another negotiating session on October 25. The parties dispute whether the Union brought up the Shea/Penniman conversation at that session. Ryan argues that there was no mention of the incident and Mortimer testified as much, but Union negotiator James Devlin testified that when he raised the question of the differences between the positions taken by Ryan at the table and those taken away from the table he was referring in part to the Shea/Penniman incident. In any case, Ryan did not change its position. When Union officials reported this to the employees, the employees reacted with disappointment and anger. Having been led to believe that an early resolution was in the offing, some blamed the Union for the lack of progress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 6 Ryan unilaterally altered the terms of employment by implementing the changes in the CBA set out in its October 2 proposal. On November 10 it also discontinued contributions to the National Shopmen Pension Fund (Fund) required under the expired CBA. At the final negotiating session on that same day, the Union modified its earlier proposal and accepted some of Ryan's proposals. Ryan rejected the Union proposal and stood on its October 2 proposal. On November 16 the Union withdrew its previous proposal and offered a three-year extension of the expired contract with several wage freeze concessions. On November 21 Ryan rejected that proposal but told the Union that it was willing to meet to \"discuss the significant differences between them.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 7 Ryan received a petition signed by fifty-five employees stating that they no longer wished to be represented by the Union and it notified the Union that it was therefore withdrawing recognition from the Union. On December 8 the Union voted to end the strike and faxed Ryan a letter offering the return of all striking workers to their jobs by December 11. When the workers showed up they were met by Shea, who told them there were no jobs for them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We grant the Board \"deference with regard to its interpretation of the Act as long as its interpretation is rational and consistent with the statute.\" NLRB v.

The Unfair Labor Practice Charge</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board accepted the ALJ's finding that Shea's discussion with Penniman was a violation of Section 8(a)(5), which prohibits employers from bypassing the Union and dealing directly with employees. Ryan initially attacks the ALJ's credibility determination, which was based principally on the relative demeanor of the witnesses and affirmed by the Board.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> That determination is entitled to great weight because the ALJ saw and heard the witnesses testify, see Holyoke Visiting Nurses Ass'n v. NLRB, 11 F.3d 302, 308 (1st Cir. 1993), and we will not disturb it so long as the ALJ's position represents a choice between two fairly conflicting views. We will set aside such findings only if we believe that the ALJ overstepped the bounds of reason. Id.; 3-E Co., Inc. v. NLRB, 26 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1994). While the ALJ's finding may have been somewhat conclusory, we see nothing in the record to suggest that it was unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ryan next contends that even if Penniman's testimony is credited, the conversation he describes is not sufficient to establish a direct dealing violation. Section 8(a)(5) of the Act imposes a duty on an employer to bargain collectively with its employees' chosen representative. This obligation is exclusive and Section 9(a) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 159(a), accordingly \"exacts 'the negative duty to treat with no other.'\" Medo Photo Supply Corp. v. NLRB, 321 U.S. 678, 684 (1944) (quoting NLRB v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U.S. 1, 44 (1937)). \"[O]rderly collective bargaining requires that the employer be not permitted to go behind the designated representatives, in order to bargain with the employees themselves. . . .\" Id. at 685. \"The fundamental inquiry in a direct dealing case is whether the employer has chosen 'to deal with the Union through the employees, rather than with the employees through the Union.'\" NLRB v. Pratt Whitney Air Craft Div., 789 F.2d 121, 134 (2d Cir. 1986) (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board found that Shea's discussion with Penniman amounted to direct dealing because \"[Shea] told Penniman that it was the Union's fault because they [sic] were not negotiating with the Company, asked Penniman what the employees wanted, and sought to minimize [Ryan's] bargaining demands.\" Ryan contends that the Board erroneously applied the law and that Shea's comments were merely an attempt to inform employees about the course of the negotiations and Ryan's position. See United Technologies Corp., 275 NLRB 1069, 1074 (1985) (\"[A]n employer has a fundamental right, protected by Section 8(C) of the Act, to communicate with its employees concerning its position in collective bargaining negotiations and the course of those negotiations.\"). Ryan characterizes the incident as simply conversation about proposals which had already been submitted to the Union and encouragement to press Union officials to start talking to management. Although Ryan concedes that Shea blamed the Union for the lack of progress, it argues that Shea never encouraged Penniman to abandon the Union in order to achieve a better deal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While an employer may communicate or clarify its position to employees, Shea, even if he did not encourage abandonment of the Union, went well beyond what is permissible. Shea told Penniman that the failure of negotiations was the Union's fault and actively solicited Penniman's input on \"what exactly . . . the men want.\" Such solicitation allows an employer to gain intelligence on employees' views and to gauge the level of support for a particular position, undermining the chosen representative's exclusive right to perform these functions. See Alexander Linn Hosp. Ass'n, 288 NLRB 103, 106 (1988), enforced, NLRB v. Wallkill Valley Gen. Hosp., 866 F.2d 632 (3d Cir. 1989); NLRB v. M.A. Harrison Mfg. Co., 682 F.2d 580, 581-82 (6th Cir. 1982) (enforcing Board order against employer for bypassing Union by directly soliciting employee views on an insurance plan). Shea, through Penniman, obtained information about the employees' views on seniority, holidays, vacation time, a 401K plan, health insurance, a work boot allowance and subcontracting. This is a virtual laundry list of the issues Ryan and the Union were covering in negotiations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to Ryan's contentions, Shea's comments on these subjects went beyond merely clarifying the proposals the company had already submitted to the Union. For instance, he told Penniman that several of Ryan's stated positions were smokescreens, and that Ryan only intended to take away two holidays rather than the five it demanded at the bargaining table. Additionally, his subsequent comment to Penniman that, \"that's what we're looking for, that kind of negotiating,\" implies that he was attempting to negotiate with the employees through Penniman. Rather than \"merely communicat[ing] what was already before the Union in a proper exercise of [Ryan's] free speech rights,\" Shea sought feedback from an employee to strengthen Ryan's position in the negotiations. Cf. Americare Pine Lodge Nursing and Rehab. Ctr. v. NLRB, 164 F.3d 867, 877 (4th Cir. 1999). That Shea picked Penniman up at the crowded picket line and three hours later dropped him off where other employees would notice and ask questions reinforces this conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case thus bears no resemblance to Americare Pine Lodge Nursing and Rehabilitation Center v. NLRB, 164 F.3d at 878-79, on which Ryan relies. There, a supervisor asked a bargaining unit employee during a smoking break what she thought of a recent employer proposal, the employee responded that it \"sounded good, but that it was only made to get rid of the Union,\" and the conversation went no further. Id. at 878. The court held that \"[n]o reasonable person could conclude that this brief exchange eroded the Union's position as the exclusive bargaining representative.\" Id. Shea's three-hour discussion with Penniman was more than this \"casual conversation.\" Id. Shea actively solicited Penniman's views, made new proposals, and, at least with respect to the subcontracting issue, questioned Penniman as to how the company's offer could be improved. Id. at 879.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, substantial evidence supports the Board's finding that Shea's October 23 conversation with Penniman violated Section 8(a)(5) of the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Conversion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"A strike begun in support of economic objectives becomes an unfair labor practice strike when the employer commits an intervening unfair labor practice which is found to make the strike last longer than it otherwise would have.\" Soule Glass and Glazing Co. v. NLRB, 652 F.2d 1055, 1079 (1st Cir. 1981). Not every unfair labor practice will convert a strike, however. We have held that \"[c]ausation is crucial: 'It must be found not only that the employer committed an unfair labor practice after the commencement of the strike, but that as a result the strike was \"expanded to include a protest over [the] unfair labor practice[],\" and that settlement of the strike was thereby delayed and the strike prolonged.'\" Harding Glass, 80 F.3d at 10 (quoting Soule Glass, 652 F.2d at 1079-80). The General Counsel bears the burden of establishing that \"the unlawful conduct was a factor (not necessarily the sole or predominate one) that caused a prolongation of the work stoppage.\" C-Line Express, 292 NLRB 638 (1989). The Board may consider both objective and subjective evidence in assessing whether the General Counsel has met this burden:Applying objective criteria, the Board and reviewing court may properly consider the probable impact of the type of unfair labor practice in question on reasonable strikers in the relevant context. Applying subjective criteria, the Board and court may give substantial weight to the strikers' own characterization of their motive for continuing to strike after the unfair labor practice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soule Glass, 652 F.2d at 1080.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ found that Shea's activity did not convert the strike because there was no evidence that the employees continued to strike because of it. A majority of the Board disagreed, finding that the strike had been converted because the unlawful effort to bypass the Union's representatives \"could not help but prevent and inhibit good- faith bargaining, thereby prolonging the strike.\" It further found this objective inference to be supported by subjective evidence of the divisive effect of this conduct on the strikers and their union negotiators. Board Member Hurtgen dissented, finding that there was no evidence that the single, isolated incident of direct dealing had a deleterious impact on subsequent negotiations or that it prolonged the strike.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The Board has in the past recognized that:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the presence or absence of evidence of [employees'] subjective motivation has not always been the sine qua non for determining whether there has been a conversion. Certain types of unfair labor practices by their nature will have a reasonable tendency to prolong the strike and therefore afford a sufficient and independent basis for finding conversion. The most notable examples typically involve an unlawful withdrawal of recognition which may be accompanied by a course of other unlawful conduct, including withdrawal of contract proposals, refusals to meet and bargain, and recognition of another union. The common thread running through these cases is the judgment of the Board that the employer's conduct is likely to have significantly interrupted or burdened the course of the bargaining process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C-Line Express, 292 NLRB at 639.

Here, the Board relies on what it calls an \"objective inference\" that Shea's conduct prolonged the strike, but it cites no objective evidence and we agree with the ALJ that \"there is simply no evidence that the employees continued to strike because of Shea's activity.\" Nor do the decisions in Safeway Trails, 233 NLRB 1078 (1977), enforced, 641 F.2d 930 (D.C. Cir. 1979), and Beaumont Glass Co., 310 NLRB 710 (1993), on which the Board relied, support its decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board has in another context described Safeway Trails as involving \"an egregious effort by the employer to obtain the employees' repudiation of their union representative as a precondition to revoking a collective bargaining agreement.\" Forest Grove Lumber Co., 275 NLRB 1007, 1007 n.1 (1985). There, the employer had engaged in repeated oral and written communications with employees and others clearly intended to undermine the status and authority of the union's chosen bargaining representative in violation of Section 8(a)(5). These efforts to undermine the union representative were well known to the employees and were discussed at meetings of the union membership. The Board found that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, the inference is clear that the Respondent's actions and communications served to aggravate and prolong the strike. The fact that the Respondent was not successful in undercutting [the Union representative] does not negate our finding that the Respondent's misconduct was a concern to employees and a factor in the prolongation of the strike. Moreover, the very nature of the Respondent's misconduct--appealing directly to employees in an attempt to undercut the union representative--is such as could not help but prevent and inhibit good-faith bargaining, thereby prolonging the strike.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Safeway Trails, 233 NLRB at 1082.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The instant case--involving a single incident which had no discernible impact on the ongoing bargaining process--bears no resemblance to Safeway Trails. Nor does it bear even remote resemblance to Beaumont Glass, where conversion was found on evidence that: the employer sent a memorandum to the membership of the union with a proposal which had not previously been made at the bargaining table; the employees complained to the union representative when he told them the proposal would not be put to a vote; the representative testified that \"the publication and distribution of the memorandum destroyed the negotiations\" and that no meaningful negotiating sessions were held subsequently; and the union changed the language on its picket signs to signify it was protesting the employer's unfair labor practices. 310 NLRB at 719. No such evidence appears in this record. Indeed, if the Shea/Penniman incident was ever mentioned at the October 25 negotiating session at all, it was at most a passing reference.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Mortimer later testified that no progress was made during that session because \"we both agreed that we were just making no changes. We were sticking to our proposal. . . . After a little discussion from both sides, it was obvious nothing was going to change. . . .\" The incident was apparently not mentioned at the October 30 session either and, as noted above, the Union did not file an unfair labor practice charge regarding the incident until nearly six months later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find Forest Grove Lumber Company, 275 NLRB 1007, more closely on point. There, the employer, during a strike, had several discussions with employees about the status of negotiations, many quite similar to the Shea/Penniman conversation. Employees testified that the vice president spoke to them about the company's proposals, the stalemate in negotiations, and the union's refusal to bargain, and solicited their views on what it would take to get the strikers back to work. One employee stated that the vice president told him that the company's proposal was not a firm proposal, that everything was negotiable, and that only by asking for more than what it wanted could the company reach an agreement. In rejecting the General Counsel's contention that the strike had been converted, the Board said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Safeway Trails involved the factual context of an egregious effort by the employer to obtain the employees' repudiation of their union representative as a precondition to revoking a collective-bargaining agreement. Consequently, the unlawful conduct in Safeway Trails clearly intruded on the bargaining process and \"could not help but\" prolong the strike. In contrast, the Respondent's unlawful conduct here involved solicitation of employees to urge their representatives to soften the Union's bargaining demands, and there was no effort to repudiate those bargaining representatives. The unfair labor practices here did not have any inevitable impact on bargaining that would necessarily cause prolongation of the strike.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 1007 n.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Simply put, that the Shea/Penniman conversation may have raised hopes among employees for an early end to the strike--hopes that were dashed when negotiations resumed, leading to \"consternation\" among employees--does not support the conclusion that the strike was thereby prolonged. \"The Board's obligation is to provide some basis for an inference that, in the aftermath of the [unfair labor practice], the employees were separately motivated by that act.\" Harding Glass, 80 F.3d at 12. It is clear that the strike was about economic issues and there is no evidence that the strikers' motivation changed, in whole or in part, on account of the Shea/Penniman incident.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> See Facet Enterprises, Inc. v. NLRB, 907 F.2d 963, 977 (10th Cir. 1990) (\"[T]o sustain a finding of conversion, there must be some evidence in the record that the . . . employees reacted to information of Facet's direct dealing substantively in a fashion which aggravated or prolonged the strike.\"); see also F.L.

NLRB, 71 F.3d 282, 288 (8th Cir. 1995) (holding it was error to base conversion finding on \"caused consternation\" test where evidence established strike remained economically motivated); Gibson Greetings, Inc., 310 NLRB 1286, 1292 n.5 (1993) (finding no conversion because \"[a]lthough several strikers testified that they were distressed by the [Company's] letter, none suggested that it was because of that letter that the strike continued, nor that the strikers discussed it collectively as a basis for continuing the strike.\"), enforcement denied on other grounds, Gibson Greetings, Inc. v.

Both sides made some concessions, and more importantly, Ryan never told the Union that failure to agree on its proposal would result in deadlock or that there was an impasse and that it would implement its proposals. See Hotel Roanoke, 293 NLRB 182, 185 (1989) (\"The failure of a party to communicate to the other party the paramount importance of the proposals presented at the bargaining table or to explain that a failure to achieve concessions would result in a bargaining deadlock evidences the absence of a valid impasse.\"). Nor is there evidence that when Ryan implemented its October 2 proposal, or at any time thereafter, a contemporaneous understanding existed between the parties that talks were at an impasse. Indeed, the parties held a negotiating session with a federal mediator on November 10, after the implementation, and the Union offered additional concessions at that time. And in a letter dated November 21, Ryan's counsel stated that although the Union's latest proposal was unacceptable, it was willing to meet and discuss \"the Company's outstanding offer of October 2nd.\" Ryan had the burden of proof on this issue and it failed to sustain it.

However, as the Board determined earlier in its opinion, it was not unlawful for Ryan to implement different terms of employment for striker replacements because struck employers have no obligation to bargain about terms of employment for replacements. See Detroit Newspaper Agency, 327 NLRB 871 (1999); see also Service Electric Co., 281 NLRB 633 n.1 (1986) (because interests of returning economic strikers are more closely aligned with those of the strike replacements than those of the strikers, an employer has no greater duty to bargain during the strike over their terms of employment than it does over the strike replacements'). Strikers observing workers at the plant that day would therefore not necessarily have concluded that their presence meant that the terms of the CBA had been unilaterally changed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the Board's evidence is, at best, circumstantial (if not entirely speculative) proof that employees may have known that a change had been made in the terms of (their) employment. But it fails to satisfy \"[t]he Board's obligation . . . to provide some basis for an inference that, in the aftermath of the implementation, the employees were separately motivated by that act.\" Harding Glass, 80 F.3d at 12. There is no objective or subjective evidence that the arrival of workers on a holiday motivated the striking employees to prolong the strike or that it interfered with the bargaining process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board's finding of conversion is not supported by substantial evidence. See Beverly Enters.-Mass., 174 F.3d at 22 n.1 (\"Substantial evidence is not a rubber stamp.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. WITHDRAWAL OF RECOGNITION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board found that on December 6 Ryan received a petition from some fifty-five cross-over and replacement workers (out of a total of ninety-five employees), stating that they did not want to be represented by the Union. On December 7 Ryan withdrew recognition based on the petition. On December 8 the Union advised that its members would unconditionally return to work on December 11. On that date, Ryan declined to reinstate the strikers, although sometime later it offered reinstatement to all but twelve of the original sixty-one strikers. The Board found the withdrawal of recognition \"in the context of unremedied unfair labor practices on December 7\" to be a violation of Section 8(a)(5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the term of a CBA, an incumbent union enjoys an irrebuttable presumption of majority employee support. See Auciello Iron Works, Inc. v. NLRB, 517 U.S. 781, 786 (1996). Upon expiration of the contract, the employer can rebut that presumption and withdraw recognition if it can show either that the union in fact lacked majority support or that the employer had a good faith, objectively justified doubt regarding the union's majority. See Destileria Serrales, Inc. v. NLRB, 882 F.2d 19, 20-21 (1st Cir. 1989). However, if an employer has \"committed as yet unremedied unfair labor practices that could have reasonably tended to contribute to employee disaffection from the union,\" it may not rely on employee expressions of disaffection, such as a petition, as a basis for withdrawal of recognition. United Supermarkets, Inc. v. NLRB, 862 F.2d 549, 553 n.6 (5th Cir. 1989) (citing Chicago Magnesium Castings Co., 256 NLRB 668, 674 (1981)); accord Bolton-Emerson, Inc. v. NLRB, 899 F.2d 104, 107-08 (1st Cir. 1989) (\"justified withdrawal [of recognition] requires . . . a context free of unfair labor practices\"); Soule Glass, 652 F.2d at 1110.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The General Counsel must prove a causal relationship between unremedied unfair labor practices and the loss of majority status, but direct evidence showing actual taint is not required. See United Supermarkets, Inc., 862 F.2d at 552 n.5. It is sufficient that the unfair labor practices would reasonably tend to cause employee disaffection. See NLRB v. Hi-Tech Cable Corp., 128 F.3d 271, 279 (5th Cir. 1997). Factors typically considered include: (1) the length of time between the unfair labor practices and the withdrawal of recognition; (2) the nature of the illegal acts, including the possibility of their detrimental or lasting effect on employees; (3) any possible tendency of the unfair labor practices to cause employee disaffection from the union; and (4) the effect of the unlawful conduct on employee morale, organizational activities, and membership in the union. Master Slack Corp., 271 NLRB 78, 84 (1984). Here, the petition was presented six weeks after the direct dealing incident and four weeks after the unlawful November 6 implementation, both violations of a type that weaken the authority of a union and encourage employees to doubt its ability to successfully represent them. While we think it is a close question, we conclude that the Board could reasonably consider that these two unfair labor practices, particularly in combination, \"significantly contributed\" to the Union's loss of majority status. Williams Enters., Inc., 312 NLRB 937, 940 (1993), enforced, NLRB v. Williams Enters., Inc., 50 F.3d 1280 (4th Cir. 1995). We therefore affirm the Board's bargaining order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the strike ended at approximately the same time as the withdrawal of recognition (at least there is no evidence of any employees being replaced on December 7 or 8), conversion is not an issue and we do not read the Board's order as making a determination of conversion based on withdrawal of recognition. Because we reject the Board's determinations of conversion on October 23 or November 11, the strikers are entitled only to the reinstatement rights of economic strikers. See Rose Printing Co., 289 NLRB 252, 253 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the Board's finding that the October 23 Shea/Penniman conversation and the November 6 unilateral implementation of Ryan's bargaining proposal constituted unfair labor practices. Further, we affirm the Board's finding that these practices \"significantly contributed\" to the Union's loss of majority status. Consequently, we affirm that portion of the Board's remedial order aimed at undoing the effects of these practices. This includes the provisions of the order requiring Ryan to recognize and bargain with the Union and, upon request, to rescind and compensate for the unilateral changes made on or after November 6, 1995 to the terms of employment for bargaining unit employees. However, because we reject the Board's determinations of conversion, we deny enforcement of that portion of the Board's order granting reinstatement and backpay to unfair labor practice strikers. Because we find that no conversion, and hence no unfair labor practice strike, occurred, this relief is no longer apposite. Accordingly, the Board's application for enforcement of its order is granted in part and denied in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GRANTED in part, DENIED in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Unlike economic strikers, unfair labor practices strikers are entitled to reinstatement and back pay even if they have been replaced during the strike.

(Ryan) petitions for review of an order of the National Labor Relations Board (Board) finding violations of Sections 8(a)(3) and (5) of the National Labor Relations Act (Act), 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167;&#167;&#167; 158(a)(3) and (5). The Board has cross-applied for enforcement of its order in which it found that Ryan had committed a series of unfair labor practices during negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the bargaining representative of its employees, Shopmen's Local 501, International Association of Bridge, Structural and Ornamental Ironworkers, AFL-CIO (the Union), and that an economic strike of its employees was converted into an unfair labor practice strike following an incident of direct dealing between Ryan's president and one of its workers. We affirm the Board's order with respect to the unfair labor practices but hold that the record lacks substantial support for the finding that the strike was converted prior to its termination on December 8, 1995. Accordingly, we grant the Board's application in part only.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ryan is a corporation engaged in the fabrication of iron, steel and metal products at its plant in Raynham, Massachusetts. It has been party to a series of CBAs with Local 501 for more than twenty-five years. The most recent CBA between the parties was in effect from September 11, 1992, to September 10, 1995. The events giving rise to this controversy occurred in the course of the negotiations for a successor CBA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties met in negotiations eight times from August 18 to November 10, 1995. The Union presented a list of demands, including significant wage and benefits increases, and Ryan, in turn, proposed to reduce wages and benefits in several areas. At the August 29 session, Union representative David Mortimer (Mortimer) told Ryan's negotiating team that the company's proposal was \"an insult and a piece of garbage\" and that the Union \"would not give up one cent\" in give backs or concessions of any kind. Another Union official made a similar comment at the August 31 session, where Ryan offered to increase its pension and health insurance contributions, and reiterated that the Union would not agree to any give backs or concessions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 7 the Union filed an unfair labor practice charge against Ryan for failure to bargain in good faith, a charge that was ultimately rejected by the Board. On September 8 the employees voted to reject Ryan's proposal. Because of the pendency of the charge, the Union told its members that a strike would be an unfair labor practice strike as opposed to an economic strike, meaning that none of them could be permanently replaced.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The members took a strike vote and went out on September 11, the day after the CBA expired. The parties continued to meet, however, and at the September 18 session the Union modified its proposal, reducing both its hourly wage and pension fund contribution demands. Ryan rejected this proposal and on October 2 countered with a proposal which included an increase in vacation time for certain employees and the shoe allowance but enlarged its right to subcontract unit work. The Union rejected this proposal but made a counterproposal for a three-year contract providing for increased wages and pension contributions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 23, Ryan's president, Howard Shea (Shea), invited Wallace Penniman (Penniman), who was walking the picket line with twenty to thirty other striking employees, to take a ride to inspect one of Ryan's construction jobs. Penniman agreed and the two men drove off. The parties dispute much of the content of the conversation during that car trip. According to Penniman, Shea stated \"that it was the Union's fault [that negotiations were going poorly] because they weren't negotiating with the Company\" and asked what exactly the men wanted. Penniman told Shea that the employees' main concern was seniority, and Shea responded that Ryan's proposal on seniority was merely a bargaining tool or a smokescreen to gain concessions. Shea told Penniman \"that [Ryan] was going to need another three-year pay freeze to be competitive with the non-union shops.\" The two men then discussed the possible pay freeze, as well as vacations, holidays, work boot allowances, subcontracting, pensions, health insurance and arbitration. According to Penniman, the discussion was extensive, lasting the entire drive to Waltham and back, a trip of about three hours. Before dropping him off, Shea told Penniman that this was the type of negotiating he was hoping for from the Union and said that there were only a few items on Ryan's list that it needed. As Penniman got out of the car at the picket line, Shea told him \"not to worry about it, that it was going to be resolved.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his testimony, Shea admitted that he told Penniman that the Union had refused to respond to any of the company's proposals but denied that there was any substantive discussion of Ryan's bargaining proposals. According to Shea, when Penniman asked him about the negotiations, Shea told him they should not discuss them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) accepted Penniman's version of the conversation and found that Shea had dealt directly with an individual employee concerning the negotiations, thereby unlawfully bypassing and undermining the Union.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Penniman testified that the conversation led him to feel optimistic about the possibility of a quick resolution and that he shared it with the other picketers who saw him leave and return with Shea. Later that day he told Union representative Mortimer about the conversation and Mortimer arranged for another negotiating session on October 25. The parties dispute whether the Union brought up the Shea/Penniman conversation at that session. Ryan argues that there was no mention of the incident and Mortimer testified as much, but Union negotiator James Devlin testified that when he raised the question of the differences between the positions taken by Ryan at the table and those taken away from the table he was referring in part to the Shea/Penniman incident. In any case, Ryan did not change its position. When Union officials reported this to the employees, the employees reacted with disappointment and anger. Having been led to believe that an early resolution was in the offing, some blamed the Union for the lack of progress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 6 Ryan unilaterally altered the terms of employment by implementing the changes in the CBA set out in its October 2 proposal. On November 10 it also discontinued contributions to the National Shopmen Pension Fund (Fund) required under the expired CBA. At the final negotiating session on that same day, the Union modified its earlier proposal and accepted some of Ryan's proposals. Ryan rejected the Union proposal and stood on its October 2 proposal. On November 16 the Union withdrew its previous proposal and offered a three-year extension of the expired contract with several wage freeze concessions. On November 21 Ryan rejected that proposal but told the Union that it was willing to meet to \"discuss the significant differences between them.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 7 Ryan received a petition signed by fifty-five employees stating that they no longer wished to be represented by the Union and it notified the Union that it was therefore withdrawing recognition from the Union. On December 8 the Union voted to end the strike and faxed Ryan a letter offering the return of all striking workers to their jobs by December 11. When the workers showed up they were met by Shea, who told them there were no jobs for them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We grant the Board \"deference with regard to its interpretation of the Act as long as its interpretation is rational and consistent with the statute.\" NLRB v.

See United Technologies Corp., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">275</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.L.R.B.</span> <span class=\"page\">1069</span></span>, 1074 (1985) (\"[A]n employer has a fundamental right, protected by Section 8(C) of the Act, to communicate with its employees concerning its position in collective bargaining negotiations and the course of those negotiations.\"). Ryan characterizes the incident as simply conversation about proposals which had already been submitted to the Union and encouragement to press Union officials to start talking to management. Although Ryan concedes that Shea blamed the Union for the lack of progress, it argues that Shea never encouraged Penniman to abandon the Union in order to achieve a better deal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While an employer may communicate or clarify its position to employees, Shea, even if he did not encourage abandonment of the Union, went well beyond what is permissible. Shea told Penniman that the failure of negotiations was the Union's fault and actively solicited Penniman's input on \"what exactly . . . the men want.\" Such solicitation allows an employer to gain intelligence on employees' views and to gauge the level of support for a particular position, undermining the chosen representative's exclusive right to perform these functions.

Shea, through Penniman, obtained information about the employees' views on seniority, holidays, vacation time, a 401K plan, health insurance, a work boot allowance and subcontracting. This is a virtual laundry list of the issues Ryan and the Union were covering in negotiations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to Ryan's contentions, Shea's comments on these subjects went beyond merely clarifying the proposals the company had already submitted to the Union. For instance, he told Penniman that several of Ryan's stated positions were smokescreens, and that Ryan only intended to take away two holidays rather than the five it demanded at the bargaining table. Additionally, his subsequent comment to Penniman that, \"that's what we're looking for, that kind of negotiating,\" implies that he was attempting to negotiate with the employees through Penniman. Rather than \"merely communicat[ing] what was already before the Union in a proper exercise of [Ryan's] free speech rights,\" Shea sought feedback from an employee to strengthen Ryan's position in the negotiations. Cf. Americare Pine Lodge Nursing and Rehab. Ctr. v. NLRB, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"760480\"><a href=\"/opinion/760480/americare-pine-lodge-nursing-and-rehabilitation-center-v-national-labor/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">867</span></a></span>, 877 (4th Cir. 1999).

NLRB, 164 F.3d at 878-79, on which Ryan relies. There, a supervisor asked a bargaining unit employee during a smoking break what she thought of a recent employer proposal, the employee responded that it \"sounded good, but that it was only made to get rid of the Union,\" and the conversation went no further. Id. at 878. The court held that \"[n]o reasonable person could conclude that this brief exchange eroded the Union's position as the exclusive bargaining representative.\" Id. Shea's three-hour discussion with Penniman was more than this \"casual conversation.\" Id. Shea actively solicited Penniman's views, made new proposals, and, at least with respect to the subcontracting issue, questioned Penniman as to how the company's offer could be improved.

Not every unfair labor practice will convert a strike, however. We have held that \"[c]ausation is crucial: 'It must be found not only that the employer committed an unfair labor practice after the commencement of the strike, but that as a result the strike was \"expanded to include a protest over [the] unfair labor practice[],\" and that settlement of the strike was thereby delayed and the strike prolonged.'\" Harding Glass, 80 F.3d at 10 (quoting Soule Glass, 652 F.2d at 1079-80).

The Board may consider both objective and subjective evidence in assessing whether the General Counsel has met this burden:Applying objective criteria, the Board and reviewing court may properly consider the probable impact of the type of unfair labor practice in question on reasonable strikers in the relevant context.

A majority of the Board disagreed, finding that the strike had been converted because the unlawful effort to bypass the Union's representatives \"could not help but prevent and inhibit good- faith bargaining, thereby prolonging the strike.\" It further found this objective inference to be supported by subjective evidence of the divisive effect of this conduct on the strikers and their union negotiators. Board Member Hurtgen dissented, finding that there was no evidence that the single, isolated incident of direct dealing had a deleterious impact on subsequent negotiations or that it prolonged the strike.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The Board has in the past recognized that:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the presence or absence of evidence of [employees'] subjective motivation has not always been the sine qua non for determining whether there has been a conversion. Certain types of unfair labor practices by their nature will have a reasonable tendency to prolong the strike and therefore afford a sufficient and independent basis for finding conversion. The most notable examples typically involve an unlawful withdrawal of recognition which may be accompanied by a course of other unlawful conduct, including withdrawal of contract proposals, refusals to meet and bargain, and recognition of another union. The common thread running through these cases is the judgment of the Board that the employer's conduct is likely to have significantly interrupted or burdened the course of the bargaining process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C-Line Express, 292 NLRB at 639.

There, the employer had engaged in repeated oral and written communications with employees and others clearly intended to undermine the status and authority of the union's chosen bargaining representative in violation of Section 8(a)(5).

The fact that the Respondent was not successful in undercutting [the Union representative] does not negate our finding that the Respondent's misconduct was a concern to employees and a factor in the prolongation of the strike. Moreover, the very nature of the Respondent's misconduct--appealing directly to employees in an attempt to undercut the union representative--is such as could not help but prevent and inhibit good-faith bargaining, thereby prolonging the strike.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Safeway Trails, 233 NLRB at 1082.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The instant case--involving a single incident which had no discernible impact on the ongoing bargaining process--bears no resemblance to Safeway Trails.

There, the employer, during a strike, had several discussions with employees about the status of negotiations, many quite similar to the Shea/Penniman conversation. Employees testified that the vice president spoke to them about the company's proposals, the stalemate in negotiations, and the union's refusal to bargain, and solicited their views on what it would take to get the strikers back to work. One employee stated that the vice president told him that the company's proposal was not a firm proposal, that everything was negotiable, and that only by asking for more than what it wanted could the company reach an agreement.

Consequently, the unlawful conduct in Safeway Trails clearly intruded on the bargaining process and \"could not help but\" prolong the strike. In contrast, the Respondent's unlawful conduct here involved solicitation of employees to urge their representatives to soften the Union's bargaining demands, and there was no effort to repudiate those bargaining representatives. The unfair labor practices here did not have any inevitable impact on bargaining that would necessarily cause prolongation of the strike.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 1007 n.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Simply put, that the Shea/Penniman conversation may have raised hopes among employees for an early end to the strike--hopes that were dashed when negotiations resumed, leading to \"consternation\" among employees--does not support the conclusion that the strike was thereby prolonged. \"The Board's obligation is to provide some basis for an inference that, in the aftermath of the [unfair labor practice], the employees were separately motivated by that act.\" Harding Glass, 80 F.3d at 12.

Indeed, the parties held a negotiating session with a federal mediator on November 10, after the implementation, and the Union offered additional concessions at that time. And in a letter dated November 21, Ryan's counsel stated that although the Union's latest proposal was unacceptable, it was willing to meet and discuss \"the Company's outstanding offer of October 2nd.\" Ryan had the burden of proof on this issue and it failed to sustain it.

However, as the Board determined earlier in its opinion, it was not unlawful for Ryan to implement different terms of employment for striker replacements because struck employers have no obligation to bargain about terms of employment for replacements.

On December 7 Ryan withdrew recognition based on the petition. On December 8 the Union advised that its members would unconditionally return to work on December 11. On that date, Ryan declined to reinstate the strikers, although sometime later it offered reinstatement to all but twelve of the original sixty-one strikers.

Hi-Tech Cable Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"747617\"><a href=\"/opinion/747617/national-labor-relations-board-v-hi-tech-cable-corporation-a-subsidiary/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">271</span></a></span>, 279 (5th Cir. 1997). Factors typically considered include: (1) the length of time between the unfair labor practices and the withdrawal of recognition; (2) the nature of the illegal acts, including the possibility of their detrimental or lasting effect on employees; (3) any possible tendency of the unfair labor practices to cause employee disaffection from the union; and (4) the effect of the unlawful conduct on employee morale, organizational activities, and membership in the union. Master Slack Corp., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">271</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.L.R.B.</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></span>, 84 (1984). Here, the petition was presented six weeks after the direct dealing incident and four weeks after the unlawful November 6 implementation, both violations of a type that weaken the authority of a union and encourage employees to doubt its ability to successfully represent them. While we think it is a close question, we conclude that the Board could reasonably consider that these two unfair labor practices, particularly in combination, \"significantly contributed\" to the Union's loss of majority status. Williams Enters., Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">312</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.L.R.B.</span> <span class=\"page\">937</span></span>, 940 (1993), enforced, NLRB v. Williams Enters., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"692290\"><a href=\"/opinion/692290/national-labor-relations-board-v-williams-enterprises-incorporated-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1280</span></a></span> (4th Cir. 1995). We therefore affirm the Board's bargaining order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the strike ended at approximately the same time as the withdrawal of recognition (at least there is no evidence of any employees being replaced on December 7 or 8), conversion is not an issue and we do not read the Board's order as making a determination of conversion based on withdrawal of recognition. Because we reject the Board's determinations of conversion on October 23 or November 11, the strikers are entitled only to the reinstatement rights of economic strikers. See Rose Printing Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">289</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.L.R.B.</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></span>, 253 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the Board's finding that the October 23 Shea/Penniman conversation and the November 6 unilateral implementation of Ryan's bargaining proposal constituted unfair labor practices. Further, we affirm the Board's finding that these practices \"significantly contributed\" to the Union's loss of majority status. Consequently, we affirm that portion of the Board's remedial order aimed at undoing the effects of these practices. This includes the provisions of the order requiring Ryan to recognize and bargain with the Union and, upon request, to rescind and compensate for the unilateral changes made on or after November 6, 1995 to the terms of employment for bargaining unit employees. However, because we reject the Board's determinations of conversion, we deny enforcement of that portion of the Board's order granting reinstatement and backpay to unfair labor practice strikers. Because we find that no conversion, and hence no unfair labor practice strike, occurred, this relief is no longer apposite. Accordingly, the Board's application for enforcement of its order is granted in part and denied in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GRANTED in part, DENIED in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Unlike economic strikers, unfair labor practices strikers are entitled to reinstatement and back pay even if they have been replaced during the strike. NLRB v. Harding Glass Co., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"715663\"><a href=\"/opinion/715663/national-labor-relations-board-v-harding-glass-company-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 10 n.3 (1st Cir. 1996).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The ALJ gave three reasons for believing Penniman over Shea, only one of which was adopted by the Board: Penniman's demeanor. The other two were: (1) the ALJ's incorrect belief that Penniman was no longer a Ryan employee or a Union member and therefore had no stake in his testimony, and (2) his assumption that Shea would not take a striking worker from the picket line for a drive and not mention the strike.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> See supra p. *, lines 93-99.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The General Counsel did not brief the issue but contended at oral argument that the record was devoid of any evidence that the strikers were separately motivated by the Shea/Penniman conversation because the ALJ erroneously sustained Ryan's objections to the necessary line of questioning. However, because the General Counsel's offer of proof, while it shows that the strikers were disturbed by the direct dealing, fails to establish that the strikers shifted the focus of their protest to include the Shea/Penniman incident and thereby prolonged the strike, we find no prejudice.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
