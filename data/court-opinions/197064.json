The sole issue before us  is whether the\r\n\njury instructions  in Koonce's state court  murder trial violated\r\n\nhis  due process rights  by impermissibly shifting  the burden of\r\n\nproof.  Like the district court  before us, we find that the jury\r\n\ninstructions did  not violate  Koonce's due process  rights under\r\n\nthe Fourteenth  Amendment, and  we therefore affirm  the district\r\n\ncourt's dismissal of the petition for habeas corpus.\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r\n\n          The events that led  to the murder charge in  this case\r\n\nare detailed in the prior decisions of the Supreme Judicial Court\r\n\n(\"SJC\").  See  Commonwealth v. Koonce  (\"Koonce II\"), 636  N.E.2d\r                                                            \r\n\n1305, 1306-07 (Mass. 1994).   In brief, on the night of  July 20,\r\n\n1987,  Koonce  and  three others  from  Brockton,  Massachusetts,\r\n\ntravelled  in a car to a nightclub  in Westport, then to a Burger\r\n\nKing  in Dartmouth,  and  finally to  a  housing project  in  New\r\n\nBedford.   At  the  first two  locations  fights erupted  between\r\n\ngroups  from New Bedford and Brockton, but Koonce and his friends\r\n\nremained  uninvolved.1    At  the New  Bedford  housing  project,\r\n\nhowever,  a confrontation arose, which resulted  in a large group\r\n\nof people from  New Bedford, including the victim, chasing Koonce\r\n\nand his friends back to their car, as well as beating a member of\r\n\nanother Brockton  group.   When Koonce  and  his friends  reached\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  There was testimony that Koonce pulled out a gun at the Burger\r\nKing.

There\r\n\nwas conflicting testimony at  trial as to how close the crowd got\r\n\nto  the car.    Once the  path  cleared, the  driver  of the  car\r\n\naccelerated.   A  shot  was fired,  and  the victim  was  fatally\r\n\nwounded.   Koonce later went to the police and stated that he had\r\n\nfired the shot.  Id. at 1307.\r                              \r\n\n          Koonce  was indicted  for murder  in the  first degree.\r\n\nHis first trial before a jury in the Massachusetts Superior Court\r\n\nended in a  mistrial when the jury was unable  to reach a verdict\r\n\non the issue of self-defense.   See id. at 1306.  A second  trial\r                                                 \r\n\nwas held in 1992,2 and the jury convicted Koonce of murder in the\r\n\nfirst degree.  Koonce was sentenced to life  imprisonment without\r\n\nthe possibility of parole.\r\n\n          Koonce filed  a motion  for new trial  asserting, inter\r                                                                           \r\n\nalia, that the final  instruction given on voluntary manslaughter\r              \r\n\nviolated his Fourteenth  Amendment right to  due process of  law.\r\n\nThe trial  judge denied the  motion, and the  SJC affirmed.   Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nKoonce subsequently  brought this petition  for a writ  of habeas\r\n\ncorpus in  the district court for the  district of Massachusetts.\r\n\nThe  district  court  dismissed  the petition,  and  this  appeal\r\n\nensued.\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r\n\n                    I.

Gen. L. ch. 211    3, on common\r\nlaw double  jeopardy principles.   Koonce's petition  was denied,\r\nand the full bench of the SJC  affirmed the order.  See Koonce v.\r                                                                        \r\nCommonwealth (\"Koonce I\"), 587 N.E.2d 220 (Mass. 1992).\r                                 \r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n          This  case centers  on a single  statement made  by the\r\n\ntrial court  in its instructions to the jury.  As the content and\r\n\ncontext  of that instruction is crucial to our analysis, we quote\r\n\nhere from the trial  court's instructions to the jury  at length.\r\n\nThe court began by instructing the jury about murder in the first\r\n\nand second degree.  It then turned to manslaughter:\r\n\n               If  .  .  . the  Commonwealth  has not\r\n            proved  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  the\r\n            elements necessary to prove the defendant\r\n            guilty  of second degree murder, then you\r\n            may consider whether the Commonwealth has\r\n            proved  the  lesser  included offense  of\r\n            manslaughter.  \r\n               Now, before I  define manslaughter,  I\r\n            made  reference  earlier to  self defense\r\n            and let me  define that specifically  now\r\n            before we discuss manslaughter.  Evidence\r\n            has been  offered in  this case  that the\r\n            defendant  acted  in  self  defense.    A\r\n            person may lawfully use  reasonable force\r\n            to defend himself from a physical attack.\r\n            Bear in mind that the defendant  does not\r\n            have to prove anything.  \r\n               If   evidence   of  self   defense  is\r\n            present,  the   Commonwealth  must  prove\r\n            beyond  a reasonable doubt he did not act\r\n            in self defense.  If the Commonwealth has\r\n            failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt\r\n            that  the defendant did  not act  in self\r\n            defense, then you must find the defendant\r\n            not guilty.  In  other words, if you have\r\n            a  reasonable doubt  whether  or not  the\r\n            defendant  acted  in  self defense,  your\r\n            verdict must be not guilty.    \r\n\nTr. at 6-61 to 6-62.  The trial court continued with instructions\r\n\nas to what a  reasonable person in the defendant's  position must\r\n\nbelieve in  order to have acted  in self defense,  and what would\r\n\nconstitute excessive force.  The instructions then went on:\r\n\n               Remember the defendant  does not  have\r\n            to prove anything.  The  prosecution must\r\n            prove  beyond a reasonable doubt that the\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n            defendant acted with excessive force.  \r\n               If   there   is   evidence  that   the\r\n            defendant may have acted in self defense,\r\n            then the Commonwealth must prove beyond a\r\n            reasonable doubt, as I said earlier, that\r\n            the   defendant  did  not   act  in  self\r\n            defense.    If  you  determine  that  the\r\n            Commonwealth has failed to prove beyond a\r\n            reasonable doubt that  the defendant  did\r\n            not act  in self defense, then  you must,\r\n            of course, find the defendant not guilty.\r\n            In other words, if you  have a reasonable\r\n            doubt as  to whether or not the defendant\r\n            acted in self  defense, your verdict must\r\n            be not guilty.\r\n               Now,  if  the  Commonwealth  fails  to\r\n            prove beyond a  reasonable doubt that the\r\n            defendant  did not  act in  self defense,\r\n            but  the Commonwealth does prove beyond a\r\n            reasonable doubt that the  defendant used\r\n            excessive force in  defending himself  in\r\n            the light of all the circumstances and if\r\n            death resulted from  the use of excessive\r\n            force, then you may consider  whether the\r\n            defendant  is   guilty  of  manslaughter.\r\n            Okay?\r\n\nTr.  at 6-61  to  6-65.    The  trial court  then  set  out  what\r\n\nmanslaughter is, the difference between murder and  manslaughter,\r\n\nwhat mitigating circumstances might negate the element of malice,\r\n\nand defined voluntary manslaughter.  It continued:\r\n\n               In order to prove the defendant guilty\r\n            of     voluntary     manslaughter     the\r\n            Commonwealth  must  prove three  elements\r\n            beyond  a reasonable doubt:   first, that\r\n            the  defendant  inflicted an  injury upon\r\n            the victim and from which injury he died;\r\n            second, that  the defendant intentionally\r\n            killed  the victim, but he used excessive\r\n            force  in self  defense; third,  that the\r\n            homicide was committed unlawfully without\r\n            legal excuse or justification.  \r\n               Now,  facts  or circumstances  as I've\r\n            indicated may mitigate  or reduce  murder\r\n            to  manslaughter.  This  is when a person\r\n            kills  using  excessive  force   in  self\r\n            defense.  That is what the Commonwealth's\r\n            theory  is.    They   say  that  if  [the\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n            defendant]  was  justified in  using self\r\n            defense,  he  used  excessive   force  in\r\n            defending himself . . . .  \r\n               Specifically, if  the person initiated\r\n            an assault  against the defendant  so the\r\n            defendant reasonably feared  that he  was\r\n            in  danger of  being killed  or suffering\r\n            grievous  bodily injury  at the  hands of\r\n            the  victim, then  the defendant  has the\r\n            initial right to  use whatever means  are\r\n            reasonably   necessary   to   avert   the\r\n            threatened  harm.   But if  the defendant\r\n            used  excessive  force --  that  is, more\r\n            force  than  was  reasonable  and  proper\r\n            under   the   circumstances  --   or  the\r\n            defendant himself became the attacker and\r\n            the use of  such excessive force resulted\r\n            in the  death of  the  victim, then  that\r\n            would constitute manslaughter.   So,  you\r\n            see it  all depends  on the facts  as you\r\n            see them.\r\n\n          Immediately   following   these  statements   came  the\r\n\ninstruction at issue here:\r\n\n               Also, you  may not return a verdict of\r\n            guilty   of   manslaughter   unless   the\r\n            defendant  proves   beyond  a  reasonable\r                                                               \r\n            doubt that the  defendant used  excessive\r                                                               \r\n            force  in defending himself, again in the\r                           \r\n            circumstances as you see them.\r\n\nTr. at 6-68  (emphasis added).  The parties  are agreed that this\r\n\nsentence of  the instruction  was faulty,  as it  is in fact  the\r\n\nCommonwealth  that  must prove  beyond  a  reasonable doubt  that\r                      \r\n\nKoonce used excessive force in his defense.3  See Commonwealth v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nRodr guez, 352 N.E.2d 203, 205-06 (Mass. 1976).\r                   \r\n\n          The  court  said no  more  on  the topic  of  voluntary\r\n\nmanslaughter.  Instead,  it moved on  to instruct on  involuntary\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3   Counsel for Koonce did  not object to the  instruction at the\r\ntime it was made, but did file a motion for a new trial  based on\r\nthis same  ground.  The SJC  and the district court  both met the\r\nissue on the merits.  See Koonce II, 636 N.E.2d at 1308.  \r                                             \r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nmanslaughter and  other matters in the case,  including the Fifth\r\n\nAmendment  and  the defendant's  right not  to  testify.   In the\r\n\ncontext of the latter, it instructed that\r\n\n               the  defendant  has an  absolute right\r\n            not to testify since the entire burden of\r\n            proof in this case is on the  prosecution\r\n            to  prove that  the defendant  is guilty.\r\n            It is  not up  to the defendant  to prove\r\n            that he is not guilty or he is innocent.\r\n\nTr. at 6-77.\r\n\n                     II.

The new language states that \r\n\n            (d) [a]n application for a writ of habeas\r\n            corpus on  behalf of a person  in custody\r\n            pursuant to the judgment of a State court\r\n            shall not be granted  with respect to any\r\n            claim that was  adjudicated on the merits\r\n            in  State  court  proceedings unless  the\r\n            adjudication of the claim --  \r\n               (1) resulted in a decision that was\r\n               contrary   to,   or   involved   an\r\n               unreasonable     application    of,\r\n               clearly established Federal law, as\r\n               determined by the Supreme  Court of\r\n               the United States; or \r\n               (2) resulted in a decision that was\r\n               based     on    an     unreasonable\r\n               determination  of    the  facts  in\r\n               light of the evidence  presented in\r\n               the State court proceeding.\r\n\n28  U.S.C.     2254(d).   The  district  court's  action preceded\r\n\nenactment  of  the  new standard,  and  so  it reviewed  Koonce's\r\n\npetition under the old standard, i.e., whether the petitioner was\r                                               \r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\n\"in  custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties\r\n\nof the United  States.\"   28 U.S.C.    2254(a).  Appellee  argues\r\n\nthat,  notwithstanding  the district  court's  use  of the  prior\r\n\nstatute, the new  standard applies  here.  However,  we need  not\r\n\ndetermine which standard applies in this context, as we find that\r\n\nunder either statute Koonce's petition must fail.\r\n\n                   B.

If so,  the court\r\n            must then consider whether other parts of\r\n            the  charge   clarified  the  ill-advised\r\n            language   with   the   result   that   a\r\n            reasonable  factfinder   would  not  have\r\n            understood the instruction  to create  an\r\n            unconsitutional presumption.  Finally, if\r\n            the court determines that the charge as a\r\n            whole   left   the    jurors   with    an\r\n            impermissible impression,  the court must\r\n            proceed to evaluate the  harmlessness vel\r                                                               \r\n            non of the error.\r                         \r\n\nAnderson  v.

The SJC, and the\r\n\ndistrict court after it, however, concluded that \"[e]ven taken in\r\n\nisolation  the jury would understand  that the judge  had made an\r\n\nerror  because there would be no purpose in the defendant proving\r\n\nhe  used  excessive  force.\"   Koonce  II,  636  N.E.2d at  1308.\r                                                   \r\n\nKoonce,  however,  maintains that  he  did  have an  interest  in\r\n\nproving  excessive force.   As  he  states in  his brief,  if his\r\n\n\"'perfect' self-defense  argument  failed,  he  certainly  had  a\r\n\ncompelling interest in convincing the  second jury that he  acted\r\n\nin self-defense,  albeit with excessive force,  and was therefore\r\n\nguilty of the lesser crime of manslaughter.\"  Brief of Appellant,\r\n\nat 13.\r\n\n          We  disagree.  Koonce's  argument would  only withstand\r\n\nscrutiny if the  jury were  asked to find  first, whether  Koonce\r\n\nacted in \"perfect\" self  defense, and if not, second,  whether he\r\n\nacted  in  self-defense  with  excessive  force.    That is  not,\r\n\nhowever,  what  the jury  was asked  to weigh.   Instead,  it was\r\n\ninstructed as follows:\r\n\n               Now,  if  the  Commonwealth  fails  to\r\n            prove beyond a reasonable doubt  that the\r\n            defendant  did not  act in  self defense,\r\n            but the Commonwealth  does prove beyond a\r\n            reasonable doubt that the  defendant used\r\n            excessive force in  defending himself  in\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\n            the light of all the circumstances and if\r\n            death resulted from  the use of excessive\r\n            force, then you may consider  whether the\r\n            defendant is guilty of manslaughter. \r\n\nTr. at 6-64  to 6-65.  In short, the jury was instructed to first\r\n\ndetermine whether the Commonwealth failed to prove Koonce did not\r\n\nact in self  defense.   Thus, the  jury would  only consider  the\r\n\nexcessive force question if it had already determined that Koonce\r\n\nhad  acted in  self-defense.   At that  juncture, it  was  not in\r\n\nKoonce's  interest for the jury  to find excessive force, because\r\n\nif  it concluded that he  had not acted  with excessive force, he\r\n\nwould be  acquitted.  Therefore,  we agree  with the SJC  and the\r\n\ndistrict court that  Koonce had  no interest in  proving that  he\r\n\nacted with excessive  force, and any reasonable juror  would have\r\n\nunderstood that it  would be  illogical for Koonce  to carry  the\r\n\nburden of proving excessive force.  \r\n\n          What is more, the verdict  suggests that the jury never\r\n\nreached  the question of excessive  force.  See  Ducette v. Vose,\r                                                                          \r\n\n842 F.2d 538, 542-43  (1st Cir. 1988) (denying petition  for writ\r\n\nof  habeas corpus where  there was  no \"virtually  no likelihood\"\r\n\nthat the  erroneous instruction could  have made a  difference in\r\n\nthe jury's deliberations).  The jury found Koonce guilty of first\r\n\ndegree murder.  As the trial court instructed the jury, the first\r\n\nelement of first degree murder is whether the defendant committed\r\n\nan  unlawful killing.   According to  the instructions,  the jury\r\n\ncould only  find that this element  was met if it  found that the\r\n\nCommonwealth proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Koonce did not\r                                                                           \r\n\nact in  self defense.   Because the  jury found Koonce  guilty of\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nfirst degree  murder, it must have  found that he did  not act in\r\n\nself-defense.  The issue of excessive force would therefore never\r\n\nhave arisen.  \r\n\n          Koonce attempts to  argue that the jury would, in fact,\r\n\nhave applied  the erroneous  instruction by maintaining  that the\r\n\nerror served to shift the burden  of proof to him on the question\r\n\nof self-defense.   Acknowledging that the  plain language of  the\r\n\ninstruction went only to excessive force, he nonetheless contends\r\n\nthat  the jury  could  have construed  the  misinstruction as  an\r\n\ninstruction requiring that Koonce prove he acted in self-defense,\r\n\nsuch   that  a   reasonable  juror   would  have   believed  that\r\n\nmanslaughter was not an  option unless Koonce demonstrated beyond\r\n\na reasonable doubt that he acted in self-defense.  \r\n\n          We find no substance in  Koonce's position.  First,  as\r\n\nthe  appellee  notes,  the  judge's statement,  given  its  plain\r\n\ninterpretation,  simply  did not  mean what  Koonce claims.   The\r\n\ninstruction was  that Koonce  had to prove  excessive force,  not\r                                                                           \r\n\nthat  he  had to  prove self-defense.    Second, the  trial court\r\n\nclearly  described  self-defense  and  excessive  force  as   two\r\n\nseparate  concepts, with the latter  only arising as  an issue if\r\n\nthe jury  did not  find the  former.  The  lines between  the two\r\n\nconcepts  were  not blurred,  as  Koonce would  have  us believe.\r\n\nSimply  put, a reasonable  juror would  not have  misconstrued an\r\n\ninstruction about  excessive force  to apply  to  the more  basic\r\n\nquestion of self-defense.\r\n\n         B.  The Instruction in the Context of the Whole\r                   B.  The Instruction in the Context of the Whole\r                                                                  \r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\n          The district court found, as did the SJC, that \"reading\r\n\nthe  charge as a whole, no reasonable  juror could have been left\r\n\nwith  any other impression  than that the burden  of proof was on\r\n\nthe  Commonwealth with respect to  every element of  the case and\r\n\nthat the defendant had no  burden whatsoever to prove  anything.\"\r\n\nDistrict  Court Memorandum of Decision  and Order, at  6.  Koonce\r\n\nargues  here that the other portions of the charge cannot explain\r\n\naway the challenged instruction,  especially given the importance\r\n\nof  the issue.   Koonce  focuses on  the fact  that this  was the\r\n\ndistrict  court's final  comment on  voluntary manslaughter.   He\r\n\ncontends that it  is more likely  that a  juror would follow  the\r\n\nerroneous instruction as it  was the judge's last comment  on the\r\n\ntopic,  and as it included  imperative language such  as \"you may\r\n\nnot.\"\r\n\n          We  disagree.   Of course,  the mere fact  that correct\r\n\ninstructions were given  as well  as the incorrect  one does  not\r\n\nsave  the  instruction.   See Libby,  19 F.3d  at  737.   But the\r                                             \r\n\njudge's  instructions here as to  burden of proof  were much more\r\n\ncomprehensive than Koonce would acknowledge.  As the SJC put it,\r\n\n            [t]he  misstatement  in  the  instruction\r\n            came after the  judge:  correctly  stated\r\n            that it was  the Commonwealth's burden to\r\n            prove   manslaughter;   twice   correctly\r\n            stated that the defendant did not have to\r\n            prove  anything;  twice correctly  stated\r\n            that the Commonwealth must prove beyond a\r\n            reasonable doubt that  the defendant  did\r\n            not act in self-defense;  twice correctly\r\n            stated  that, if  there was  a reasonable\r\n            doubt as to  whether the defendant  acted\r\n            in self-defense, the  verdict must be not\r\n            guilty; and three times  correctly stated\r\n            that the Commonwealth must prove beyond a\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\n            reasonable doubt that the  defendant used\r\n            excessive force.  \r\n\nKoonce  II, 636  N.E.2d  at 1309.   What  is  more, although  the\r                    \r\n\nchallenged   instruction   was   the  last   word   on  voluntary\r\n\nmanslaughter,  the judge  continued  his instructions,  correctly\r\n\napportioning the  burden of  proof for  involuntary manslaughter,\r\n\nand, most significantly, stating that \"the entire burden of proof\r\n\nin this case is on the prosecution to prove that the defendant is\r\n\nguilty.\"  Tr. at 6-77.  In this context, and  given our agreement\r\n\nwith  the SJC \"that the offending language was meaningless in the\r\n\ncontext of the trial and the  charge as a whole,\" id., our review\r                                                               \r\n\nof  the totality  of  the  jury  instructions  leads  us  to  the\r\n\nconclusion that any confusion was adequately clarified, and so no\r\n\nreasonable   juror  would   have  applied   the  unconstitutional\r\n\ninstruction.   See  Anderson,  23 F.3d  at  597; cf.  Francis  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nFranklin,  471 U.S.  307, 315  (1985) (\"Other  instructions might\r                  \r\n\nexplain  the particular  infirm  language to  the  extent that  a\r\n\nreasonable juror  could not  have considered  the charge to  have\r\n\ncreated an unconstitutional presumption.\").  \r\n\n          Koonce next  argues that, for two  reasons, viewing the\r\n\nrecord as a whole, the trial court's error \"'\"had substantial and\r\n\ninjurious   effect  or  influence   in  determining   the  jury's\r\n\nverdict.\"'\"   Libby,   19  F.3d   at   738  (quoting   Brecht  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nAbrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 623 (1993) (quoting Kotteakos v.

Second,\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\nKoonce  maintains  that the  facts  of this  case,  including his\r\n\nflight  from a large group of people  who had just beaten another\r\n\nman, and the  firing of only a single shot,  paired with the fact\r\n\nthat  the first jury to hear the  case could not reach a verdict,\r\n\nmandate  the  conclusion  that  the  trial  judge's error  had  a\r\n\nsubstantial impact on Koonce's  chance for acquittal, or, at  the\r\n\nvery  least, a  manslaughter  verdict.   These circumstances,  he\r\n\nurges,  should lead  to  \"grave doubt\"  in our  minds  as to  the\r\n\nharmlessness  of the  trial court's  error, such  that we  should\r\n\ntreat the error  as if it  affected the verdict.   See O'Neil  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nMcAninch,    U.S.   ,   , 115 S. Ct. 992, 994 (1995).  \r                  \r\n\n          Koonce  cites no  authority  for his  premise that  the\r\n\nmistrial  in his first trial  should shade our  reasoning in this\r\n\ncase.   Even assuming that we  should do so, however,  we find no\r\n\nreason to doubt our  conclusion that the error was  harmless.  No\r\n\nreasonable juror  would have  applied the  erroneous instruction,\r\n\ngiven  that the instructions as  a whole clarified  the burden of\r\n\nproof, that  Koonce had no  interest in proving  excessive force,\r\n\nand that the jury found Koonce guilty of first degree murder, and\r\n\nthus should never  have had  to weigh the  question of  excessive\r\n\nforce.   In  essence,  Koonce's last  argument is  really seeking\r\n\nclemency, based on  the tragic  circumstances of this  case.   We\r\n\nrecognize that  we are Koonce's court of last resort.  A grant of\r\n\nclemency,  however, is not within this court's purview, and so we\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\naffirm the decision of the district court.4\r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r\n\n          For  the reasons  detailed above,  the decision  of the\r\n\ndistrict court  denying Koonce's  petition for  a writ of  habeas\r\n\ncorpus is affirmed.\r                    affirmed\r                            \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n4   The  Supreme Court  has found  that the  traditional harmless\r\nerror  analysis   does  not  apply  to   jury  instructions  that\r\nconstitute  a \"'structural  defect[] in  the constitution  of the\r\ntrial  mechanism.'\"   Sullivan  v.  Louisiana,  508 U.S.  at  281\r                                                       \r\n(quoting  Arizona v. Fulminante, 499  U.S. 279, 309  (1991)).  In\r                                         \r\nSullivan, the  Court  found  that  an instruction  that  gave  an\r                  \r\nunconstitutional  definition  of \"reasonable  doubt\" misdescribed\r\nthe burden of  proof, such  that there essentially  was \"no  jury\r\nverdict within the meaning of the  Sixth Amendment.\"  Id. at 280.\r                                                                   \r\nThe  Court stated that \"the  essential connection to  a 'beyond a\r\nreasonable  doubt'  factual  finding  cannot be  made  where  the\r\ninstructional error consists of a misdescription of the burden of\r\nproof, which vitiates all the jury's findings.\"  Id. at 281.  \r                                                              \r\n\n   Koonce cites Sullivan here for the proposition that  the error\r                                  \r\nin this case worked a federal due process violation, but does not\r\nargue that the error was structural, such that the harmless error\r\nstandard  would not apply.  Nonetheless, for the sake of clarity,\r\nwe   note  that  this  was  not  a  \"structural\"  error,  as  the\r\nmisinstruction did not  relieve the Commonwealth  of its duty  to\r\nprove  each element of  the crime, but rather,  as the SJC found,\r\n\"placed  the  burden  on   the  defendant  of  proving  something\r\n(excessive force) that any  reasonable juror would understand was\r\nantithetical to his  defense.\"   Koonce II, 636  N.E.2d at  1308.\r                                                    \r\nExamination of  Sullivan and  the other recognized  exceptions to\r                                  \r\nharmless error analysis  reveals that, unlike in those cases, the\r\nerror here is not a \"'structural defect[] in the trial mechanism'\r\nwhich affect[s] 'the entire conduct  of the trial from  beginning\r\nto  end' and  'without [which] a  criminal trial  cannot reliably\r\nserve  its function as a  vehicle for determination  for guilt or\r\ninnocence.'\"  United States v.

The sole issue before us is whether the jury instructions in Koonce's state court murder trial violated his due process rights by impermissibly shifting the burden of proof.  Like the district court before us, we find that the jury instructions did not violate Koonce's due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, and we therefore affirm the district court's dismissal of the petition for habeas corpus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The events that led to the murder charge in this case are detailed in the prior decisions of the Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\").  See Commonwealth v. Koonce (\"Koonce II \"), 418 Mass. 367, 636 N.E.2d 1305, 1306-07 (1994).  In brief, on the night of July 20, 1987, Koonce and three others from Brockton, Massachusetts, travelled in a car to a nightclub in Westport, then to a Burger King in Dartmouth, and finally to a housing project in New Bedford.  At the first two locations fights erupted between groups from New Bedford and Brockton, but Koonce and his friends remained uninvolved.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  At the New Bedford housing project, however, a confrontation arose, which resulted in a large group of people from New Bedford, including the victim, chasing Koonce and his friends back to their car, as well as beating a member of another Brockton group.  When Koonce and his friends reached their car, their path was blocked by another automobile.  There was conflicting testimony at trial as to how close the crowd got to the car.  Once the path cleared, the driver of the car accelerated.  A shot was fired, and the victim was fatally wounded.  Koonce later went to the police and stated that he had fired the shot.  Id. 636 N.E.2d at 1307.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Koonce was indicted for murder in the first degree.  His first trial before a jury in the Massachusetts Superior Court ended in a mistrial when the jury was unable to reach a verdict on the issue of self-defense.  See id. at 1306.   A second trial was held in 1992,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and the jury convicted Koonce of murder in the first degree.  Koonce was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Koonce filed a motion for new trial asserting, inter alia, that the final instruction given on voluntary manslaughter violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process of law.  The trial judge denied the motion, and the SJC affirmed.  Id.  Koonce subsequently brought this petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court for the district of Massachusetts.  The district court dismissed the petition, and this appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>I. The Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case centers on a single statement made by the trial court in its instructions to the jury.  As the content and context of that instruction are crucial to our analysis, we quote here from the trial court's instructions to the jury at length.  The court began by instructing the jury about murder in the first and second degree.  It then turned to manslaughter:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If ... the Commonwealth has not proved beyond a reasonable doubt the elements necessary to prove the defendant guilty of second degree murder, then you may consider whether the Commonwealth has proved the lesser included offense of manslaughter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, before I define manslaughter, I made reference earlier to self defense and let me define that specifically now before we discuss manslaughter.  Evidence has been offered in this case that the defendant acted in self defense.  A person may lawfully use reasonable force to defend himself from a physical attack.  Bear in mind that the defendant does not have to prove anything.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If evidence of self defense is present, the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt he did not act in self defense.  If the Commonwealth has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self defense, then you must find the defendant not guilty.  In other words, if you have a reasonable doubt whether or not the defendant acted in self defense, your verdict must be not guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. at 6-61 to 6-62.  The trial court continued with instructions as to what a reasonable person in the defendant's position must believe in order to have acted in self defense, and what would constitute excessive force.  The instructions then went on:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Remember the defendant does not have to prove anything.  The prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted with excessive force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If there is evidence that the defendant may have acted in self defense, then the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt, as I said earlier, that the defendant did not act in self defense.  If you determine that the Commonwealth has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self defense, then you must, of course, find the defendant not guilty.  In other words, if you have a reasonable doubt as to whether or not the defendant acted in self defense, your verdict must be not guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, if the Commonwealth fails to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self defense, but the Commonwealth does prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant used excessive force in defending himself in the light of all the circumstances and if death resulted from the use of excessive force, then you may consider whether the defendant is guilty of manslaughter.  Okay?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. at 6-61 to 6-65.  The trial court then set out what manslaughter is, the difference between murder and manslaughter, what mitigating circumstances might negate the element of malice, and defined voluntary manslaughter.  It continued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to prove the defendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter the Commonwealth must prove three elements beyond a reasonable doubt:  first, that the defendant inflicted an injury upon the victim and from which injury he died;  second, that the defendant intentionally killed the victim, but he used excessive force in self defense;  third, that the homicide was committed unlawfully without legal excuse or justification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, facts or circumstances as I've indicated may mitigate or reduce murder to manslaughter.  This is when a person kills using excessive force in self defense.  That is what the Commonwealth's theory is.  They say that if [the defendant] was justified in using self defense, he used excessive force in defending himself</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Specifically, if the person initiated an assault against the defendant so the defendant reasonably feared that he was in danger of being killed or suffering grievous bodily injury at the hands of the victim, then the defendant has the initial right to use whatever means are reasonably necessary to avert the threatened harm.  But if the defendant used excessive force--that is, more force than was reasonable and proper under the circumstances--or the defendant himself became the attacker and the use of such excessive force resulted in the death of the victim, then that would constitute manslaughter.  So, you see it all depends on the facts as you see them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Immediately following these statements came the instruction at issue here:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also, you may not return a verdict of guilty of manslaughter unless the defendant proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant used excessive force in defending himself, again in the circumstances as you see them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. at 6-68 (emphasis added).  The parties are agreed that this sentence of the instruction was faulty, as it is in fact the Commonwealth that must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Koonce used excessive force in his defense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  See Commonwealth v. Rodrguez, 370 Mass. 684, 352 N.E.2d 203, 205-06 (1976).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court said no more on the topic of voluntary manslaughter.  Instead, it moved on to instruct on involuntary manslaughter and other matters in the case, including the Fifth Amendment and the defendant's right not to testify.  In the context of the latter, it instructed that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the defendant has an absolute right not to testify since the entire burden of proof in this case is on the prosecution to prove that the defendant is guilty.  It is not up to the defendant to prove that he is not guilty or he is innocent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. at 6-77.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. The Legal Framework</p>\n    <p>A. The Standard Governing the Writ</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April of 1996, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub.L. 104-132, Title I, &#167; 104, 110 Stat. 1219, changed the standard governing the issuance of the writ of habeas corpus.  The new language states that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>(d) [a]n application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States;  or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d).  The district court's action preceded enactment of the new standard, and so it reviewed Koonce's petition under the old standard, i.e., whether the petitioner was \"in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\"  28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(a).  Appellee argues that, notwithstanding the district court's use of the prior statute, the new standard applies here.  However, we need not determine which standard applies in this context, as we find that under either statute Koonce's petition must fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Applicable Case Law</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court analyzed Koonce's claim that the jury instruction violated his due process rights under Hill v. Maloney, 927 F.2d 646 (1st Cir.1990), and Koonce maintains that we should do the same.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>Under Hill, a reviewing court must first determine whether a reasonable juror would have interpreted the challenged portion of the instruction as creating a mandatory presumption.  If so, the court must then consider whether other parts of the charge clarified the ill-advised language with the result that a reasonable factfinder would not have understood the instruction to create an unconstitutional presumption.  Finally, if the court determines that the charge as a whole left the jurors with an impermissible impression, the court must proceed to evaluate the harmlessness vel non of the error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Anderson v. Butler, 23 F.3d 593, 595 (1st Cir.)  (citations omitted), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 934, 115 S.Ct. 331, 130 L.Ed.2d 289 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellee, however, argues that Koonce's reliance on Hill is misplaced.  Appellee contends that the instruction at issue here did not create a presumption, mandatory or otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>A mandatory presumption instructs the jury that it must infer an \"elemental fact\" such as intent or malice from proof of a \"basic fact\" such as a knowing act....  A permissive presumption allows but does not require the jury to infer the elemental fact upon proof of the basic facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hill, 927 F.2d at 648-49;  see, e.g., Libby v. Duval, 19 F.3d 733, 735-36 (1st Cir.)  (finding instruction that \"[m]alice is implied in every deliberate cruel act by one against another\" created mandatory presumption), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 927, 115 S.Ct. 314, 130 L.Ed.2d 277 (1994).  We agree that no such presumption was established here.  As appellant notes, read literally, the instruction simply misinforms the jury that to warrant a verdict of manslaughter, Koonce was required to prove that he acted with excessive force.  The instruction did not state that upon finding certain predicate facts, the jury could infer that a necessary element of the Commonwealth's case had been met.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we turn to the traditional harmless error analysis.  See Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.S. 275, 281, 113 S.Ct. 2078, 2082-83, 124 L.Ed.2d 182 (1993).  \"The only question for us is 'whether the ailing instruction by itself so infected the entire trial that the resulting conviction violates due process.' \"  Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 72, 112 S.Ct. 475, 482, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991) (quoting Cupp v. Naughten, 414 U.S. 141, 147, 94 S.Ct. 396, 400, 38 L.Ed.2d 368 (1973)).  We must address the instruction \"in the context of the instructions as a whole and the trial record,\" and \"inquire 'whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way' that violates the Constitution.\"  Id. (quoting Boyde v. California, 494 U.S. 370, 380, 110 S.Ct. 1190, 1198, 108 L.Ed.2d 316 (1990));  see also Gilday v.

The Individual Instruction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taken literally, the erroneous instruction shifted the burden of proof on excessive force to Koonce.  The SJC, and the district court after it, however, concluded that \"[e]ven taken in isolation the jury would understand that the judge had made an error because there would be no purpose in the defendant proving he used excessive force.\"  Koonce II, 636 N.E.2d at 1308.   Koonce, however, maintains that he did have an interest in proving excessive force.  As he states in his brief, if his \" 'perfect' self-defense argument failed, he certainly had a compelling interest in convincing the second jury that he acted in self-defense, albeit with excessive force, and was therefore guilty of the lesser crime of manslaughter.\"   Brief of Appellant, at 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree.  Koonce's argument would only withstand scrutiny if the jury were asked to find first, whether Koonce acted in \"perfect\" self defense, and if not, second, whether he acted in self-defense with excessive force.  That is not, however, what the jury was asked to weigh.  Instead, it was instructed as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, if the Commonwealth fails to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self defense, but the Commonwealth does prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant used excessive force in defending himself in the light of all the circumstances and if death resulted from the use of excessive force, then you may consider whether the defendant is guilty of manslaughter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. at 6-64 to 6-65.  In short, the jury was instructed to first determine whether the Commonwealth failed to prove Koonce did not act in self defense.  Thus, the jury would only consider the excessive force question if it had already determined that Koonce had acted in self-defense.  At that juncture, it was not in Koonce's interest for the jury to find excessive force, because if it concluded that he had not acted with excessive force, he would be acquitted.  Therefore, we agree with the SJC and the district court that Koonce had no interest in proving that he acted with excessive force, and any reasonable juror would have understood that it would be illogical for Koonce to carry the burden of proving excessive force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What is more, the verdict suggests that the jury never reached the question of excessive force.  See Doucette v. Vose, 842 F.2d 538, 542-43 (1st Cir.1988) (denying petition for writ of habeas corpus where there was no \"virtually no likelihood\" that the erroneous instruction could have made a difference in the jury's deliberations).  The jury found Koonce guilty of first degree murder.  As the trial court instructed the jury, the first element of first degree murder is whether the defendant committed an unlawful killing.  According to the instructions, the jury could only find that this element was met if it found that the Commonwealth proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Koonce did not act in self defense.  Because the jury found Koonce guilty of first degree murder, it must have found that he did not act in self-defense.  The issue of excessive force would therefore never have arisen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Koonce attempts to argue that the jury would, in fact, have applied the erroneous instruction by maintaining that the error served to shift the burden of proof to him on the question of self-defense.  Acknowledging that the plain language of the instruction went only to excessive force, he nonetheless contends that the jury could have construed the misinstruction as an instruction requiring that Koonce prove he acted in self-defense, such that a reasonable juror would have believed that manslaughter was not an option unless Koonce demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that he acted in self-defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no substance in Koonce's position.  First, as the appellee notes, the judge's statement, given its plain interpretation, simply did not mean what Koonce claims.  The instruction was that Koonce had to prove excessive force, not that he had to prove self-defense.  Second, the trial court clearly described self-defense and excessive force as two separate concepts, with the latter only arising as an issue if the jury did not find the former.  The lines between the two concepts were not blurred, as Koonce would have us believe.  Simply put, a reasonable juror would not have misconstrued an instruction about excessive force to apply to the more basic question of self-defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p>B. The Instruction in the Context of the Whole</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found, as did the SJC, that \"reading the charge as a whole, no reasonable juror could have been left with any other impression than that the burden of proof was on the Commonwealth with respect to every element of the case and that the defendant had no burden whatsoever to prove anything.\"   District Court Memorandum of Decision and Order, at 6.  Koonce argues here that the other portions of the charge cannot explain away the challenged instruction, especially given the importance of the issue.  Koonce focuses on the fact that this was the district court's final comment on voluntary manslaughter.  He contends that it is more likely that a juror would follow the erroneous instruction as it was the judge's last comment on the topic, and as it included imperative language such as \"you may not.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree.  Of course, the mere fact that correct instructions were given as well as the incorrect one does not save the instruction.  See Libby, 19 F.3d at 737.   But the judge's instructions here as to burden of proof were much more comprehensive than Koonce would acknowledge.  As the SJC put it,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p>[t]he misstatement in the instruction came after the judge:  correctly stated that it was the Commonwealth's burden to prove manslaughter;  twice correctly stated that the defendant did not have to prove anything;  twice correctly stated that the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self-defense;  twice correctly stated that, if there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the defendant acted in self-defense, the verdict must be not guilty;  and three times correctly stated that the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant used excessive force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Koonce II, 636 N.E.2d at 1309.   What is more, although the challenged instruction was the last word on voluntary manslaughter, the judge continued his instructions, correctly apportioning the burden of proof for involuntary manslaughter, and, most significantly, stating that \"the entire burden of proof in this case is on the prosecution to prove that the defendant is guilty.\"   Tr. at 6-77.  In this context, and given our agreement with the SJC \"that the offending language was meaningless in the context of the trial and the charge as a whole,\" id., our review of the totality of the jury instructions leads us to the conclusion that any confusion was adequately clarified, and so no reasonable juror would have applied the unconstitutional instruction.  See Anderson, 23 F.3d at 597;  cf. Francis v. Franklin, 471 U.S. 307, 315, 105 S.Ct. 1965, 1971, 85 L.Ed.2d 344 (1985) (\"Other instructions might explain the particular infirm language to the extent that a reasonable juror could not have considered the charge to have created an unconstitutional presumption.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Koonce next argues that, for two reasons, viewing the record as a whole, the trial court's error \" ' \"had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict.\" ' \"  Libby, 19 F.3d at 738 (quoting Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 623, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 1714, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) (quoting Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 776, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 1253, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946))).  First, he reiterates his position that the instruction placed the burden on him to prove self-defense, an argument we have already dismissed.  Second, Koonce maintains that the facts of this case, including his flight from a large group of people who had just beaten another man, and the firing of only a single shot, paired with the fact that the first jury to hear the case could not reach a verdict, mandate the conclusion that the trial judge's error had a substantial impact on Koonce's chance for acquittal, or, at the very least, a manslaughter verdict.  These circumstances, he urges, should lead to \"grave doubt\" in our minds as to the harmlessness of the trial court's error, such that we should treat the error as if it affected the verdict.  See O'Neal v. McAninch, 513 U.S. 432, ----, 115 S.Ct. 992, 994, 130 L.Ed.2d 947 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Koonce cites no authority for his premise that the mistrial in his first trial should shade our reasoning in this case.  Even assuming that we should do so, however, we find no reason to doubt our conclusion that the error was harmless.  No reasonable juror would have applied the erroneous instruction, given that the instructions as a whole clarified the burden of proof, that Koonce had no interest in proving excessive force, and that the jury found Koonce guilty of first degree murder, and thus should never have had to weigh the question of excessive force.  In essence, Koonce's last argument is really seeking clemency, based on the tragic circumstances of this case.  We recognize that we are Koonce's court of last resort.  A grant of clemency, however, is not within this court's purview, and so we affirm the decision of the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons detailed above, the decision of the district court denying Koonce's petition for a writ of habeas corpus is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> There was testimony that Koonce pulled out a gun at the Burger King.

The SJC and the district court both met the issue on the merits.  See Koonce II, 636 N.E.2d at 1308</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The Supreme Court has found that the traditional harmless error analysis does not apply to jury instructions that constitute a \" 'structural defect[ ] in the constitution of the trial mechanism.' \"  Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.S. at 281, 113 S.Ct. at 2082 (quoting Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279, 309, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 1265, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991)).  In Sullivan, the Court found that an instruction that gave an unconstitutional definition of \"reasonable doubt\" misdescribed the burden of proof, such that there essentially was \"no jury verdict within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment.\"  Id. at 280, 113 S.Ct. at 2082.   The Court stated that \"the essential connection to a 'beyond a reasonable doubt' factual finding cannot be made where the instructional error consists of a misdescription of the burden of proof, which vitiates all the jury's findings.\"  Id. at 281, 113 S.Ct. at 2082</p>\n        <p>Koonce cites Sullivan here for the proposition that the error in this case worked a federal due process violation, but does not argue that the error was structural, such that the harmless error standard would not apply.  Nonetheless, for the sake of clarity, we note that this was not a \"structural\" error, as the misinstruction did not relieve the Commonwealth of its duty to prove each element of the crime, but rather, as the SJC found, \"placed the burden on the defendant of proving something (excessive force) that any reasonable juror would understand was antithetical to his defense.\"  Koonce II, 636 N.E.2d at 1308.   Examination of Sullivan and the other recognized exceptions to harmless error analysis reveals that, unlike in those cases, the error here is not a \" 'structural defect[ ] in the trial mechanism' which affect[s] 'the entire conduct of the trial from beginning to end' and 'without [which] a criminal trial cannot reliably serve its function as a vehicle for determination for guilt or innocence.' \"  United States v. Brand, 80 F.3d 560, 568 (1st Cir.1996) (quoting Fulminante, 499 U.S. at 309-10, 111 S.Ct. at 1265);  see also Fulminante, 499 U.S. at 309-10, 111 S.Ct. at 1264-65 (listing constitutional violations that have been found to constitute structural defects).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

In brief, on the night of July 20, 1987, Koonce and three others from Brockton, Massachusetts, travelled in a car to a nightclub in Westport, then to a Burger King in Dartmouth, and finally to a housing project in New Bedford.  At the first two locations fights erupted between groups from New Bedford and Brockton, but Koonce and his friends remained uninvolved.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  At the New Bedford housing project, however, a confrontation arose, which resulted in a large group of people from New Bedford, including the victim, chasing Koonce and his friends back to their car, as well as beating a member of another Brockton group.  When Koonce and his friends reached their car, their path was blocked by another automobile.  There was conflicting testimony at trial as to how close the crowd got to the car.  Once the path cleared, the driver of the car accelerated.  A shot was fired, and the victim was fatally wounded.  Koonce later went to the police and stated that he had fired the shot.  Id. 636 N.E.2d at 1307.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Koonce was indicted for murder in the first degree.  His first trial before a jury in the Massachusetts Superior Court ended in a mistrial when the jury was unable to reach a verdict on the issue of self-defense.  See id. at 1306.   A second trial was held in 1992,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and the jury convicted Koonce of murder in the first degree.

The trial judge denied the motion, and the SJC affirmed.  Id.  Koonce subsequently brought this petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court for the district of Massachusetts.  The district court dismissed the petition, and this appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>I. The Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case centers on a single statement made by the trial court in its instructions to the jury.  As the content and context of that instruction are crucial to our analysis, we quote here from the trial court's instructions to the jury at length.  The court began by instructing the jury about murder in the first and second degree.  It then turned to manslaughter:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If ... the Commonwealth has not proved beyond a reasonable doubt the elements necessary to prove the defendant guilty of second degree murder, then you may consider whether the Commonwealth has proved the lesser included offense of manslaughter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, before I define manslaughter, I made reference earlier to self defense and let me define that specifically now before we discuss manslaughter.  Evidence has been offered in this case that the defendant acted in self defense.  A person may lawfully use reasonable force to defend himself from a physical attack.  Bear in mind that the defendant does not have to prove anything.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If evidence of self defense is present, the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt he did not act in self defense.  If the Commonwealth has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self defense, then you must find the defendant not guilty.  In other words, if you have a reasonable doubt whether or not the defendant acted in self defense, your verdict must be not guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. at 6-61 to 6-62.  The trial court continued with instructions as to what a reasonable person in the defendant's position must believe in order to have acted in self defense, and what would constitute excessive force.  The instructions then went on:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Remember the defendant does not have to prove anything.  The prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted with excessive force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If there is evidence that the defendant may have acted in self defense, then the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt, as I said earlier, that the defendant did not act in self defense.  If you determine that the Commonwealth has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self defense, then you must, of course, find the defendant not guilty.  In other words, if you have a reasonable doubt as to whether or not the defendant acted in self defense, your verdict must be not guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, if the Commonwealth fails to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self defense, but the Commonwealth does prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant used excessive force in defending himself in the light of all the circumstances and if death resulted from the use of excessive force, then you may consider whether the defendant is guilty of manslaughter.  Okay?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. at 6-61 to 6-65.  The trial court then set out what manslaughter is, the difference between murder and manslaughter, what mitigating circumstances might negate the element of malice, and defined voluntary manslaughter.  It continued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to prove the defendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter the Commonwealth must prove three elements beyond a reasonable doubt:  first, that the defendant inflicted an injury upon the victim and from which injury he died;  second, that the defendant intentionally killed the victim, but he used excessive force in self defense;  third, that the homicide was committed unlawfully without legal excuse or justification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, facts or circumstances as I've indicated may mitigate or reduce murder to manslaughter.  This is when a person kills using excessive force in self defense.  That is what the Commonwealth's theory is.  They say that if [the defendant] was justified in using self defense, he used excessive force in defending himself</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Specifically, if the person initiated an assault against the defendant so the defendant reasonably feared that he was in danger of being killed or suffering grievous bodily injury at the hands of the victim, then the defendant has the initial right to use whatever means are reasonably necessary to avert the threatened harm.  But if the defendant used excessive force--that is, more force than was reasonable and proper under the circumstances--or the defendant himself became the attacker and the use of such excessive force resulted in the death of the victim, then that would constitute manslaughter.  So, you see it all depends on the facts as you see them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Immediately following these statements came the instruction at issue here:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also, you may not return a verdict of guilty of manslaughter unless the defendant proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant used excessive force in defending himself, again in the circumstances as you see them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. at 6-68 (emphasis added).  The parties are agreed that this sentence of the instruction was faulty, as it is in fact the Commonwealth that must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Koonce used excessive force in his defense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  See Commonwealth v.

The Individual Instruction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taken literally, the erroneous instruction shifted the burden of proof on excessive force to Koonce.  The SJC, and the district court after it, however, concluded that \"[e]ven taken in isolation the jury would understand that the judge had made an error because there would be no purpose in the defendant proving he used excessive force.\"  Koonce II, 636 N.E.2d at 1308.   Koonce, however, maintains that he did have an interest in proving excessive force.  As he states in his brief, if his \" 'perfect' self-defense argument failed, he certainly had a compelling interest in convincing the second jury that he acted in self-defense, albeit with excessive force, and was therefore guilty of the lesser crime of manslaughter.\"   Brief of Appellant, at 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree.  Koonce's argument would only withstand scrutiny if the jury were asked to find first, whether Koonce acted in \"perfect\" self defense, and if not, second, whether he acted in self-defense with excessive force.  That is not, however, what the jury was asked to weigh.  Instead, it was instructed as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, if the Commonwealth fails to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self defense, but the Commonwealth does prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant used excessive force in defending himself in the light of all the circumstances and if death resulted from the use of excessive force, then you may consider whether the defendant is guilty of manslaughter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. at 6-64 to 6-65.  In short, the jury was instructed to first determine whether the Commonwealth failed to prove Koonce did not act in self defense.  Thus, the jury would only consider the excessive force question if it had already determined that Koonce had acted in self-defense.  At that juncture, it was not in Koonce's interest for the jury to find excessive force, because if it concluded that he had not acted with excessive force, he would be acquitted.  Therefore, we agree with the SJC and the district court that Koonce had no interest in proving that he acted with excessive force, and any reasonable juror would have understood that it would be illogical for Koonce to carry the burden of proving excessive force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What is more, the verdict suggests that the jury never reached the question of excessive force.  See Doucette v. Vose, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"503430\"><a href=\"/opinion/503430/william-h-doucette-jr-v-george-vose/\"><span class=\"volume\">842</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">538</span></a></span>, 542-43 (1st Cir.1988) (denying petition for writ of habeas corpus where there was no \"virtually no likelihood\" that the erroneous instruction could have made a difference in the jury's deliberations).  The jury found Koonce guilty of first degree murder.  As the trial court instructed the jury, the first element of first degree murder is whether the defendant committed an unlawful killing.  According to the instructions, the jury could only find that this element was met if it found that the Commonwealth proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Koonce did not act in self defense.  Because the jury found Koonce guilty of first degree murder, it must have found that he did not act in self-defense.  The issue of excessive force would therefore never have arisen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Koonce attempts to argue that the jury would, in fact, have applied the erroneous instruction by maintaining that the error served to shift the burden of proof to him on the question of self-defense.  Acknowledging that the plain language of the instruction went only to excessive force, he nonetheless contends that the jury could have construed the misinstruction as an instruction requiring that Koonce prove he acted in self-defense, such that a reasonable juror would have believed that manslaughter was not an option unless Koonce demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that he acted in self-defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no substance in Koonce's position.  First, as the appellee notes, the judge's statement, given its plain interpretation, simply did not mean what Koonce claims.  The instruction was that Koonce had to prove excessive force, not that he had to prove self-defense.  Second, the trial court clearly described self-defense and excessive force as two separate concepts, with the latter only arising as an issue if the jury did not find the former.  The lines between the two concepts were not blurred, as Koonce would have us believe.  Simply put, a reasonable juror would not have misconstrued an instruction about excessive force to apply to the more basic question of self-defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p>B. The Instruction in the Context of the Whole</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found, as did the SJC, that \"reading the charge as a whole, no reasonable juror could have been left with any other impression than that the burden of proof was on the Commonwealth with respect to every element of the case and that the defendant had no burden whatsoever to prove anything.\"   District Court Memorandum of Decision and Order, at 6.  Koonce argues here that the other portions of the charge cannot explain away the challenged instruction, especially given the importance of the issue.  Koonce focuses on the fact that this was the district court's final comment on voluntary manslaughter.  He contends that it is more likely that a juror would follow the erroneous instruction as it was the judge's last comment on the topic, and as it included imperative language such as \"you may not.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree.  Of course, the mere fact that correct instructions were given as well as the incorrect one does not save the instruction.  See Libby, 19 F.3d at 737.   But the judge's instructions here as to burden of proof were much more comprehensive than Koonce would acknowledge.  As the SJC put it,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p>[t]he misstatement in the instruction came after the judge:  correctly stated that it was the Commonwealth's burden to prove manslaughter;  twice correctly stated that the defendant did not have to prove anything;  twice correctly stated that the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self-defense;  twice correctly stated that, if there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the defendant acted in self-defense, the verdict must be not guilty;  and three times correctly stated that the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant used excessive force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Koonce II, 636 N.E.2d at 1309.   What is more, although the challenged instruction was the last word on voluntary manslaughter, the judge continued his instructions, correctly apportioning the burden of proof for involuntary manslaughter, and, most significantly, stating that \"the entire burden of proof in this case is on the prosecution to prove that the defendant is guilty.\"   Tr. at 6-77.  In this context, and given our agreement with the SJC \"that the offending language was meaningless in the context of the trial and the charge as a whole,\" id., our review of the totality of the jury instructions leads us to the conclusion that any confusion was adequately clarified, and so no reasonable juror would have applied the unconstitutional instruction.

First, he reiterates his position that the instruction placed the burden on him to prove self-defense, an argument we have already dismissed.  Second, Koonce maintains that the facts of this case, including his flight from a large group of people who had just beaten another man, and the firing of only a single shot, paired with the fact that the first jury to hear the case could not reach a verdict, mandate the conclusion that the trial judge's error had a substantial impact on Koonce's chance for acquittal, or, at the very least, a manslaughter verdict.  These circumstances, he urges, should lead to \"grave doubt\" in our minds as to the harmlessness of the trial court's error, such that we should treat the error as if it affected the verdict.  See O'Neal v. McAninch, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117897\"><a href=\"/opinion/117897/oneal-v-mcaninch/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span>, ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117897\"><a href=\"/opinion/117897/oneal-v-mcaninch/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Even assuming that we should do so, however, we find no reason to doubt our conclusion that the error was harmless.  No reasonable juror would have applied the erroneous instruction, given that the instructions as a whole clarified the burden of proof, that Koonce had no interest in proving excessive force, and that the jury found Koonce guilty of first degree murder, and thus should never have had to weigh the question of excessive force.  In essence, Koonce's last argument is really seeking clemency, based on the tragic circumstances of this case.  We recognize that we are Koonce's court of last resort.  A grant of clemency, however, is not within this court's purview, and so we affirm the decision of the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons detailed above, the decision of the district court denying Koonce's petition for a writ of habeas corpus is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> There was testimony that Koonce pulled out a gun at the Burger King.

The SJC and the district court both met the issue on the merits.  See Koonce II, 636 N.E.2d at 1308</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The Supreme Court has found that the traditional harmless error analysis does not apply to jury instructions that constitute a \" 'structural defect[ ] in the constitution of the trial mechanism.' \"  Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.S. at 281, 113 S.Ct. at 2082 (quoting Arizona v. Fulminante, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112566\"><a href=\"/opinion/112566/arizona-v-fulminante/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></a></span>, 309, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112566\"><a href=\"/opinion/112566/arizona-v-fulminante/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1246</span></a></span>, 1265, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112566\"><a href=\"/opinion/112566/arizona-v-fulminante/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span> (1991)).  In Sullivan, the Court found that an instruction that gave an unconstitutional definition of \"reasonable doubt\" misdescribed the burden of proof, such that there essentially was \"no jury verdict within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment.\"  Id. at 280, 113 S.Ct. at 2082.   The Court stated that \"the essential connection to a 'beyond a reasonable doubt' factual finding cannot be made where the instructional error consists of a misdescription of the burden of proof, which vitiates all the jury's findings.\"  Id. at 281, 113 S.Ct. at 2082</p>\n        <p>Koonce cites Sullivan here for the proposition that the error in this case worked a federal due process violation, but does not argue that the error was structural, such that the harmless error standard would not apply.  Nonetheless, for the sake of clarity, we note that this was not a \"structural\" error, as the misinstruction did not relieve the Commonwealth of its duty to prove each element of the crime, but rather, as the SJC found, \"placed the burden on the defendant of proving something (excessive force) that any reasonable juror would understand was antithetical to his defense.\"  Koonce II, 636 N.E.2d at 1308.   Examination of Sullivan and the other recognized exceptions to harmless error analysis reveals that, unlike in those cases, the error here is not a \" 'structural defect[ ] in the trial mechanism' which affect[s] 'the entire conduct of the trial from beginning to end' and 'without [which] a criminal trial cannot reliably serve its function as a vehicle for determination for guilt or innocence.' \"  United States v. Brand, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196648\"><a href=\"/opinion/196648/united-states-v-brand/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">560</span></a></span>, 568 (1st Cir.1996) (quoting Fulminante, 499 U.S. at 309-10, 111 S.Ct. at 1265);  see also Fulminante, 499 U.S. at 309-10, 111 S.Ct. at 1264-65 (listing constitutional violations that have been found to constitute structural defects).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
