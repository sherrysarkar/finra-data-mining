He was sentenced  to two years probation,  including\r\n\neight months home confinement, and fined $30,000.  Rosen argues \r\n\nthat the elements  of mail fraud were  not met by his  failure to\r\n\ndisclose certain  information about  a proposed  asset sale,  and\r\n\nthat there was insufficient evidence to convict.

Roberts, 119 F.3d  1006, 1008 (1st\r                                                \r\n\nCir. 1997) (no  need to view  record in  light most favorable  to\r\n\ngovernment in  context of  prosecutorial misconduct  claim).   On\r\n\nthis appeal, we  are limited to the evidence  and inferences most\r\n\nfavorable to the  verdict, and on this basis  the following facts\r\n\ncould have been found by the jury.\r\n\n          Rosen  served  as  legal  counsel  to  the  owners  and\r\n\noperators of New England Tri-State Development Corporation (\"Tri-\r\n\nState\").  Tri-State,  which was owned and operated  by George and\r\n\nKevin Kattar, operated a golf course in Massachusetts and held an\r\n\napproximately 1,100 acre parcel of undeveloped land in Maine.  In\r\n\nApril1992, Tri-Statefileda voluntaryChapter11 bankruptcypetition.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n          At some  point in the  winter of 1993-94,  Kevin Kattar\r\n\ntold  Rosen that  a  Maine lumberman  named  Michael Griffen  was\r\n\npotentially interested  in purchasing  the Maine  property for  a\r\n\ntotal  of approximately $1  million, to be  paid in installments.\r\n\nGriffen  was  in  contact with  another  Maine  lumberman, Orland\r\n\nDwelley, who also had some interest  in purchasing and developing\r\n\nthe  Maine property.    In  March 1994,  the  Tri-State case  was\r\n\nconverted to a  Chapter 7 liquidation, and  Joseph Braunstein was\r\n\nappointed as  trustee.  During the Chapter  7 conversion hearing,\r\n\nRosen,  appearing as the debtor Tri-State's attorney, stated that\r\n\nTri-State  had  received  an  offer  of  $500,000  for the  Maine\r\n\nproperty, and also stated that Tri-State believed the property to\r\n\nbe worth $750,000.\r\n\n          After the conversion, and no later than May 1994, Rosen\r\n\nbegan negotiating a possible  sale price with Griffen.   Although\r\n\nKevin Kattar sought a $1 million sale price during a meeting with\r\n\nGriffen  and  Rosen on  May  25,  1994,  no concrete  terms  were\r\n\nassented to.  In a letter of May 16, 1994, Rosen indicated to the\r\n\ntrustee that Rosen was attempting  to find a buyer for the  Maine\r\n\nproperty at a price of \"$500,000  cash.\"  In a letter to  Griffen\r\n\ndated June 6, 1994, Rosen stated that,  based on the May 25, 1994\r\n\nmeeting with Griffen in Boston, it was Rosen's understanding that\r\n\nGriffen wished to \"buy the above  property . . . at a total  cost\r\n\nto you which will  not exceed $1,000,000.00, including  legal and\r\n\nconsulting fees, payable  no more than $525,000.00  upon delivery\r\n\nof good, clear, and marketable title  . . . and any balance  over\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nup to  four years.\"   The  June 6,  1994 letter  to Griffen  also\r\n\nsuggested two  approaches to selling  the Maine property,  one of\r\n\nwhich was the following: \r\n\n          2.   Having  you make  an  offer to  purchase\r\n          directly to the trustee for $500,000 cash and\r\n          then  hiring Kevin and  George Kattar to help\r\n          you  develop  the  property at  a  salary  of\r\n          $60,000.00  per  year  each  on  a  four year\r\n          employment contract.1\r\n\nGriffen did not sign or return Rosen's letter.\r\n\n          Soon,  it became  clear that  Orland  Dwelley, and  not\r\n\nGriffen, would be the most  likely purchaser and developer of the\r\n\nMaine property.  Rosen telephoned Dwelley to  discuss a sale at a\r\n\nnet price  of $1 million, with $500,000 to  be paid up front.  On\r\n\nJuly 12, 1994, Rosen  sent a letter to  Dwelley stating that  the\r\n\noffer price was for $500,000, and adding the following:\r\n\n            In  addition, our  understanding is  that\r\n            you, with  Mr. Griffin,  will engage  the\r\n            Kattar  boys as  your  consultants for  a\r\n            total  amount of  $475,000, payable  over\r\n            four years in  monthly payments totalling\r\n            $9896.00 (each  of  the  two  Kattars  to\r\n            receive one-half, or $4948.00 per month).\r\n            Lastly,  you  will   pay  me  a  fee   of\r\n            $25,000.00  if  you   are  successful  at\r\n            acquiring   the    property,   but    not\r\n            otherwise, payable at closing.\r\n\nDwelley signed  and returned  an attached letter  dated July  14,\r\n\n1994, which Rosen had prepared, stating in pertinent part:\r\n\n            we  (together  with our  associates)  are\r\n            prepared to pay the sum of $1,000,000 for\r\n            the   Property   in   approximately   the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  The  other approach discussed  in the letter  was reaching  an\r\nunderstanding  with  the holders  of  the mortgage  on  the Maine\r\nproperties to buy  the property from the Trustee and then sell it\r\nto Griffen.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n            following manner: $500,000  upon delivery\r\n            of  a  Deed  conveying  good  record  and\r\n            marketable title,  . . . and  the balance\r\n            (less  our  expenses for  your  services)\r\n            over  a period  of years  (not to  exceed\r\n            five)  either by way of a secured note or\r\n            consulting fees, secured by a lien on the\r\n            property.\r\n\n            For your  services as aforesaid,  we will\r\n            pay you  the sum of  $25,000, plus actual\r\n            expenses, at Closing.\r\n\n          Rosen also drafted  an offer letter from Dwelley to the\r\n\ntrustee, which stated a $500,000  offer price but did not mention\r\n\nany further payments to be made  to either the Kattars or  Rosen.\r\n\nThe offer  letter, which was  signed by Dwelley and  forwarded by\r\n\nRosen to  the trustee  on July 18,  1994, stated  that \"we  would\r\n\nexpect to seek  to employ one or  more of the former  officers of\r\n\nTri-State to  assist us in  marketing the property,\" but  did not\r\n\nprovide any further details.\r\n\n          Rosen never disclosed  to the trustee the  substance of\r\n\nthe employment relationship discussed in his correspondence  with\r\n\nDwelley.  Rosen  did not provide the  trustee with a copy  of the\r\n\nJuly 14,  1994 letter  that  Dwelley signed.    When the  trustee\r\n\nquestioned  Rosen  on  July  25,  1994  about  the  reference  in\r\n\nDwelley's offer letter to the possible employment of \"one or more\r\n\nof the former officers\" of Tri-State, Rosen told the trustee that\r\n\nthere  \"was  nothing definite  as  far as  what  the compensation\r\n\n[would be] or even if they would be employed.\"\r\n\n          In  a letter  to  Dwelley dated  August 2,  1994, Rosen\r\n\nwrote:\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n            I  forgot  to  mention in  our  telephone\r\n            conversation that if you get a  call from\r\n            the   Trustee,  whose   name  is   Joseph\r\n            Braunstein,  or his  associate  . .  .  I\r\n            would prefer that you  not give either of\r\n            them  the   salary  details   about  your\r\n            agreement to hire the Kattar  boys if the\r\n            sale goes through.\r\n\nRosen  used another  attorney, John  Rodman, as  the attorney  of\r\n\nrecord for  Dwelley.  When Rodman  asked Rosen if  there had been\r\n\nany  specific employment arrangements for the Kattars, Rosen told\r\n\nhim that there was nothing  in writing and no specific agreement,\r\n\nwhich information Rodman later relayed to the trustee.\r\n\n          In  November  1994,  the  trustee  ultimately  accepted\r\n\nDwelley's  second written offer  for the Maine  properties, which\r\n\nagain offered $500,000, but with  a higher initial deposit.  That\r\n\noffer tracked the language of the first offer letter and had been\r\n\nmailed to  Rosen, who  then forwarded  it  to the  trustee.   The\r\n\ntrustee sought  bankruptcy  court  approval  for the  sale.    On\r\n\nJanuary  3, 1995, Rosen attended  the bankruptcy court hearing on\r\n\nthe motion to sell the  property to Dwelley, and said  nothing to\r\n\ncontradict  the notion  that  Dwelley's  $500,000  was  the  best\r\n\navailable offer for the  debtor's Maine property, or  to indicate\r\n\nthat  a larger  offer  of  $1 million  had  been contemplated  by\r\n\nDwelley.\r\n\n          Before  the scheduled closing,  an attorney working for\r\n\nDwelley   in  Maine  asked   Rosen  to  explain   the  employment\r\n\narrangement regarding the  Kattars.  That attorney,  Laurie Dart,\r\n\nthen informed  the trustee  that there  may have been  additional\r\n\narrangements for future payments to the Kattars.  Upon hearing of\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nthe  previously  undisclosed  arrangements, the  trustee  filed a\r\n\nmotion to revoke the court-approved sale of the Maine property.  \r\n\n          In the fall  of 1995, the trustee ultimately received a\r\n\nthird offer from  Dwelley, and entered into an  agreement to sell\r\n\nthe Maine property  to Dwelley for  $730,000 in  cash.  No  terms\r\n\nregarding  any subsequent  payments  (or regarding  the  Kattars'\r\n\nemployment) were part of the final sale transaction.\r\n\n          At trial, the  government sought to prove  that Rosen's\r\n\nfailure  to disclose  information regarding  what the  government\r\n\nreferred to as the \"side agreement\" with Dwelley was a fraudulent\r\n\nscheme intended to prevent the  trustee from receiving as much as\r\n\npossible from  the sale  of the  debtor's estate.   Specifically,\r\n\nRosen was charged with using the  mails in the course of tricking\r\n\nthe trustee into approving a $500,000 sale which in fact was a $1\r\n\nmillion dollar sale, with the remainder to be paid to the Kattars\r\n\nand Rosen.  The four counts of Rosen's indictment under 18 U.S.C.\r\n\n  1341 comprised of two mailings related to each of Dwelley's two\r\n\noffers  to  purchase  the  property  for  $500,000  --  including\r\n\nmailings  from  Dwelley to  Rosen  that  Rosen forwarded  to  the\r\n\ntrustee in July and October 1994.\r\n\n          The jury rendered  guilty verdicts on all  four counts.\r\n\nPrior  to the  end of  trial, the  district court  denied Rosen's\r\n\nmotion for judgment of acquittal.   On appeal, Rosen again argues\r\n\nthat  there  was insufficient  evidence to  support a  mail fraud\r\n\nconviction, in essence because there was not a binding employment\r\n\nagreement between Dwelley and the Kattars.\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r\n\n          Rosen's chief contention  on appeal is that  to support\r\n\nhis conviction  under 18 U.S.C.    1341, the government  bore the\r\n\nburden  of  proving  beyond a  reasonable  doubt  that  a binding\r\n\nemployment agreement existed between the purchaser, Dwelley,  and\r\n\nRosen's  clients, the  Kattars, that  Rosen  failed to  disclose.\r\n\nThus,  Rosen  argues  that  either his  motion  for  judgment  of\r\n\nacquittal should have been granted  -- because such proof was not\r\n\noffered -- or, in the  alternative, his proposed jury instruction\r\n\nstating that  proof of an  employment agreement was  necessary to\r\n\nsupport  a guilty verdict should  have been incorporated into the\r\n\ndistrict court's instructions.\r\n\n          Without doubting  that a  binding employment  agreement\r\n\nwould have  made Rosen's  incomplete disclosures  to the  trustee\r\n\nmore egregious, or  more obviously illegal, we find  that proving\r\n\nRosen's  failure  to  disclose  a binding  agreement  was  not  a\r                                                   \r\n\nnecessary prerequisite to establishing this mail fraud violation.\r\n\nWhen the  evidence  is viewed  as  a  whole, in  the  light  most\r\n\nfavorable to the verdict, drawing all credibility issues in favor\r\n\nof  the verdict,  as is  appropriate in  reviewing  a sufficiency\r\n\nclaim, see,  e.g., United States  v. Fulmer, 108 F.3d  1486, 1490\r                                                     \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1997), we see a  set of facts that would be  sufficient\r\n\nto \"allow a rational jury\" to render  a guilty verdict.

It covers  deceptive\r\n\nschemes  to deprive  victims of  a wide  variety of  tangible and\r\n\nintangible property  interests; such a scheme must, at a minimum,\r\n\ncontemplate either  some \"articulable  harm\" befalling the  fraud\r\n\nvictim  or \"some  gainful use\"  of the  object of  the fraudulent\r\n\nscheme  by the  perpetrator, regardless  of whether  this use  is\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  18 U.S.C.   1341 (Supp. 1997) provides in pertinent part:\r\n\n            Whoever, having  devised or  intending to\r\n            devise any scheme or artifice to defraud,\r\n            or  for obtaining  money  or property  by\r\n            means of  false or  fraudulent pretenses,\r\n            representations, or  promises .  . .  for\r\n            the purposes of  executing such scheme or\r\n            artifice or attempting  to do so,  places\r\n            in   any   post  office   or   authorized\r\n            depository for mail matter, any matter or\r\n            thing whatever to be sent or delivered by\r\n            the Postal  Service, .  . .  or takes  or\r\n            receives therefrom, . . . any such matter\r\n            or thing, shall be fined under this title\r\n            or imprisoned  not more than  five years,\r\n            or both.\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nprofitable in  the economic sense.   United States  v. Czubinski,\r                                                                          \r\n\n106 F.3d  1069, 1074-75 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\n\n          Direct proof of fraudulent intent is often difficult to\r\n\nfind, and thus we have long permitted the inference of fraudulent\r\n\nintent from circumstantial evidence.  See, e.g., United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nGoodchild, 25 F.3d 55, 60 (1st Cir. 1994).  Here, there was ample\r                   \r\n\nevidence to support  the jury's conclusion that Rosen  acted with\r\n\nthe  purpose of defrauding  Tri-State's trustee in  bankruptcy of\r\n\namounts  that a buyer, Orland Dwelley, was willing to pay for the\r\n\ndebtor  Tri-State's  Maine   property.    It  is   certainly  not\r\n\nirrational  to  conclude  that  information  regarding  Dwelley's\r\n\nwillingness to pay a total of one million dollars over time would\r\n\nhave been valuable  to the trustee, regardless of  whether it was\r\n\nproven that Dwelley would have been willing to pay what  he later\r\n\npaid,  namely  $730,000, at  the  time  of  his second  offer  of\r\n\n$500,000.\r\n\n          The  letters between  Rosen and  Dwelley  in July  1994\r\n\nsupport  the conclusion  that  a  side  agreement to  employ  the\r\n\nKattars  --   and  for  Dwelley   to  thereby  pay  a   total  of\r\n\napproximately  $1 million -- existed.   The language of Dwelley's\r\n\nreply  letter  to Rosen  dated  July  14,  1994  is  particularly\r\n\ntelling,  stating that \"[w]e  (together with our  associates) are\r\n\nwilling  to  pay  a  total  of $1,000,000  for  the  Property  in\r\n\napproximately the following  manner: $500,000 upon delivery  of a\r\n\nDeed  .  . .  and the  balance .  .  . over  a period  of years.\"\r\n\nComparing these  letters with  the testimony  of the  trustee and\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nwith the  offer letters to  the trustee indicates that  Rosen was\r\n\nnot forthcoming in his representations regarding the structure of\r\n\nthe asset sale.   Furthermore, Rosen asked Dwelley  in writing to\r\n\n\"not give [the trustee or his associate] the salary details about\r\n\nyour agreement to hire the Kattar boys if the sale goes through.\"\r\n\nAll of this  evidence can  support a  rational jury's  conclusion\r\n\nthat Rosen, in  structuring the initial offer by  Dwelley, sought\r\n\nto induce the  trustee \"into believing that a  $500,000 offer had\r\n\nbeen made to buy  the Maine property, when in fact  the offer was\r\n\nfor $1 million,\" as Rosen's indictment alleged.\r\n\n          Rosen  argues  that  any  side  agreement  between  the\r\n\nKattars and Dwelley was not binding.  The side agreement need not\r\n\nhave been binding, however, in order to establish that hiding the\r\n\ninformation from the trustee  satisfied the element of a  \"scheme\r\n\nor artifice  to defraud\"  in this  case.  18  U.S.C.    1341.   A\r\n\nrational  jury  could  have  found  that  a  legally  non-binding\r\n\nagreement between Rosen and Dwelley regarding a $1 million dollar\r\n\npurchase  price was intentionally  kept hidden from  the trustee,\r\n\nand that  regardless of its  non-binding nature, the  trustee was\r\n\nthereby  tricked into  believing  that $500,000  represented  the\r\n\nextent of Dwelley's interest in the properties.  Simply put, from\r\n\nthe point  of view of  the trustee, the value  of the information\r\n\nthat Rosen concealed derives from  the fact that Dwelley may have\r\n\nbeen willing  to pay more  than $500,000  for the property  -- it\r\n\ndoes not turn  on whether that  interest was fixed  in a  legally\r\n\nbinding agreement.\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\n          A mail fraud  conviction may be based  on a defendant's\r\n\n\"deceptive  conduct,\" a category  that certainly may  include the\r\n\ndissemination  of  incomplete  information,  where  the  specific\r\n\nintent to defraud exists.

Wallach, 935 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n445,  462-63 (2d  Cir.  1991)).   The jury  could  choose not  to\r\n\nbelieve  Rosen's  explanation  for his  failure  to  disclose the\r\n\nunderstanding reached with Dwelley, which is that he believed the\r\n\ntrustee did not want to  entertain offers that involved  payments\r\n\nover time.   A rational jury could  also infer an intent  to harm\r\n\nthe  debtor  estate, which  under the  most basic  bankruptcy law\r\n\nprinciples is  entitled to  the full value  of the  consideration\r\n\npaid  for an  estate asset.   11  U.S.C.   541(a)(6);  see, e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nUnited  States v.  Knight, 336  U.S.  505, 508  (1949) (\"All  the\r                                   \r\n\nconsideration which is paid for  a bankrupt's assets becomes part\r\n\nof the  estate.   No device or  arrangement, however  subtle, can\r\n\nsubtract or divert any of it.\").  \r\n\n          Rosen  also seems to  argue that the  indictment itself\r\n\nalleged  that a  binding  employment agreement  was  part of  the\r\n\nfraudulent scheme.  We might concur,  but for the fact that Rosen\r\n\nhimself  described  the   correspondence  with   Dwelley  as   an\r\n\n\"agreement.\"  He  cannot  now  be heard  to  complain  about  the\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\ngovernment's  and court's  adoption of  his own  definition.   It\r\n\nfollows  that  the district  court  did  not  err in  failing  to\r\n\ninstruct  the jury  that it  must find  that a  binding agreement\r\n\nbetween Dwelley  and the  Kattars was formed.   Our review  of an\r\n\nalleged legal error in a jury instruction is de novo.  We find no\r                                                              \r\n\nerror  in the district  court's instructions, which  informed the\r\n\njury  that the government  \"must prove beyond  a reasonable doubt\r\n\nthat there  was an agreement  to pay additional money,\"  and that\r\n\ngave an acceptable definition of an \"agreement\" as requiring that\r\n\nthe  parties  manifest  an  agreement  to the  same  terms.    As\r\n\ndiscussed above, the mail fraud statute plainly does  not require\r\n\nthat Rosen's deceptive behavior regarding a buyer's true level of\r\n\ninterest  be in  relation  to a  binding, as  opposed  to a  non-\r\n\nbinding,  agreement with  the  buyer to  pay  additional sums  of\r\n\nmoney.\r\n\n          Finally, relying  on United  States v.  D'Amato,3 Rosen\r                                                                   \r\n\nargues that,  in the absence  of a necessary harm  resulting from\r\n\nthe fraudulent scheme, the government had to prove Rosen's intent\r\n\nto defraud  with independent  evidence. See  D'Amato, 39  F.3d at\r                                                              \r\n\n1257  (\"Where the  scheme does  not cause  injury to  the alleged\r\n\nvictim  as  its  necessary result,  the  government  must produce\r\n\nevidence   independent  of  the   alleged  scheme  to   show  the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3  Rosen  cites United States  v.

Sawyer, however, pertained\r                                                       \r\nto proof regarding  the elements, not of    1341, but of    1346,\r\nthe \"honest  services fraud\"  provision.

We disagree with  the premise\r\n\nthat  Rosen's scheme  does not  necessarily  contemplate a  harm.\r\n\nViewing the evidence in the  light most favorable to the verdict,\r\n\nwe see an attempt to prevent all of the proceeds of an asset sale\r\n\nfrom going to the debtor's estate itself.  To deprive the trustee\r\n\nof  a  debtor  in bankruptcy  of  accurate  information regarding\r\n\ngreater amounts that a  potential buyer is willing to pay is harm\r\n\nenough.  Compare with Czubinski, 106 F.3d at 1074 (no deprivation\r                                         \r\n\nof  property interest in confidential information for purposes of\r\n\nfederal fraud statute  where no gainful use  or other articulable\r\n\nharm followed from mere browsing  of taxpayer files).  Here, once\r\n\nthe side agreement was unearthed, the trustee took quick steps to\r\n\ndissolve  the approved  $500,000 sale,  and  eventually sold  the\r\n\nproperty to the same buyer at  $730,000.  The two cases cited  by\r\n\nRosen in  support of  his contention that  no harm  is implicated\r\n\nhere are readily distinguishable on the facts.  See United States\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.

Gonzalez-Maldonado, 115 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir.1997), unless presented with a claim that suggests that the jury's balanced assessment of the evidence was itself somehow tainted, see United States v. Roberts, 119 F.3d 1006, 1008 (1st Cir.1997) (no need to view record in light most favorable to government in context of prosecutorial misconduct claim).  On this appeal, we are limited to the evidence and inferences most favorable to the verdict, and on this basis the following facts could have been found by the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rosen served as legal counsel to the owners and operators of New England Tri-State Development Corporation (\"Tri-State\").  Tri-State, which was owned and operated by George and Kevin Kattar, operated a golf course in Massachusetts and held an approximately 1,100 acre parcel of undeveloped land in Maine.  In April 1992, Tri-State filed a voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At some point in the winter of 1993-94, Kevin Kattar told Rosen that a Maine lumberman named Michael Griffen was potentially interested in purchasing the Maine property for a total of approximately $1 million, to be paid in installments.  Griffen was in contact with another Maine lumberman, Orland Dwelley, who also had some interest in purchasing and developing the Maine property.  In March 1994, the Tri-State case was converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation, and Joseph Braunstein was appointed as trustee.  During the Chapter 7 conversion hearing, Rosen, appearing as the debtor Tri-State's attorney, stated that Tri-State had received an offer of $500,000 for the Maine property, and also stated that Tri-State believed the property to be worth $750,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the conversion, and no later than May 1994, Rosen began negotiating a possible sale price with Griffen.  Although Kevin Kattar sought a $1 million sale price during a meeting with Griffen and Rosen on May 25, 1994, no concrete terms were assented to.  In a letter of May 16, 1994, Rosen indicated to the trustee that Rosen was attempting to find a buyer for the Maine property at a price of \"$500,000 cash.\"   In a letter to Griffen dated June 6, 1994, Rosen stated that, based on the May 25, 1994 meeting with Griffen in Boston, it was Rosen's understanding that Griffen wished to \"buy the above property ... at a total cost to you which will not exceed $1,000,000.00, including legal and consulting fees, payable no more than $525,000.00 upon delivery of good, clear, and marketable title ... and any balance over up to four years.\"   The June 6, 1994 letter to Griffen also suggested two approaches to selling the Maine property, one of which was the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>2.  Having you make an offer to purchase directly to the trustee for $500,000 cash and then hiring Kevin and George Kattar to help you develop the property at a salary of $60,000.00 per year each on a four year employment contract.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Griffen did not sign or return Rosen's letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soon, it became clear that Orland Dwelley, and not Griffen, would be the most likely purchaser and developer of the Maine property.  Rosen telephoned Dwelley to discuss a sale at a net price of $1 million, with $500,000 to be paid up front.  On July 12, 1994, Rosen sent a letter to Dwelley stating that the offer price was for $500,000, and adding the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>In addition, our understanding is that you, with Mr. Griffin, will engage the Kattar boys as your consultants for a total amount of $475,000, payable over four years in monthly payments totalling $9896.00 (each of the two Kattars to receive one-half, or $4948.00 per month).  Lastly, you will pay me a fee of $25,000.00 if you are successful at acquiring the property, but not otherwise, payable at closing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dwelley signed and returned an attached letter dated July 14, 1994, which Rosen had prepared, stating in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>we (together with our associates) are prepared to pay the sum of $1,000,000 for the Property in approximately the following manner:  $500,000 upon delivery of a Deed conveying good record and marketable title, ... and the balance (less our expenses for your services) over a period of years (not to exceed five) either by way of a secured note or consulting fees, secured by a lien on the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>For your services as aforesaid, we will pay you the sum of $25,000, plus actual expenses, at Closing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rosen also drafted an offer letter from Dwelley to the trustee, which stated a $500,000 offer price but did not mention any further payments to be made to either the Kattars or Rosen.  The offer letter, which was signed by Dwelley and forwarded by Rosen to the trustee on July 18, 1994, stated that \"we would expect to seek to employ one or more of the former officers of Tri-State to assist us in marketing the property,\" but did not provide any further details.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rosen never disclosed to the trustee the substance of the employment relationship discussed in his correspondence with Dwelley.  Rosen did not provide the trustee with a copy of the July 14, 1994 letter that Dwelley signed.  When the trustee questioned Rosen on July 25, 1994 about the reference in Dwelley's offer letter to the possible employment of \"one or more of the former officers\" of Tri-State, Rosen told the trustee that there \"was nothing definite as far as what the compensation [would be] or even if they would be employed.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a letter to Dwelley dated August 2, 1994, Rosen wrote:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>I forgot to mention in our telephone conversation that if you get a call from the Trustee, whose name is Joseph Braunstein, or his associate ... I would prefer that you not give either of them the salary details about your agreement to hire the Kattar boys if the sale goes through.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rosen used another attorney, John Rodman, as the attorney of record for Dwelley.  When Rodman asked Rosen if there had been any specific employment arrangements for the Kattars, Rosen told him that there was nothing in writing and no specific agreement, which information Rodman later relayed to the trustee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1994, the trustee ultimately accepted Dwelley's second written offer for the Maine properties, which again offered $500,000, but with a higher initial deposit.  That offer tracked the language of the first offer letter and had been mailed to Rosen, who then forwarded it to the trustee.  The trustee sought bankruptcy court approval for the sale.  On January 3, 1995, Rosen attended the bankruptcy court hearing on the motion to sell the property to Dwelley, and said nothing to contradict the notion that Dwelley's $500,000 was the best available offer for the debtor's Maine property, or to indicate that a larger offer of $1 million had been contemplated by Dwelley.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the scheduled closing, an attorney working for Dwelley in Maine asked Rosen to explain the employment arrangement regarding the Kattars.  That attorney, Laurie Dart, then informed the trustee that there may have been additional arrangements for future payments to the Kattars.  Upon hearing of the previously undisclosed arrangements, the trustee filed a motion to revoke the court-approved sale of the Maine property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the fall of 1995, the trustee ultimately received a third offer from Dwelley, and entered into an agreement to sell the Maine property to Dwelley for $730,000 in cash.  No terms regarding any subsequent payments (or regarding the Kattars' employment) were part of the final sale transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the government sought to prove that Rosen's failure to disclose information regarding what the government referred to as the \"side agreement\" with Dwelley was a fraudulent scheme intended to prevent the trustee from receiving as much as possible from the sale of the debtor's estate.  Specifically, Rosen was charged with using the mails in the course of tricking the trustee into approving a $500,000 sale which in fact was a $1 million dollar sale, with the remainder to be paid to the Kattars and Rosen.  The four counts of Rosen's indictment under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341 comprised of two mailings related to each of Dwelley's two offers to purchase the property for $500,000--including mailings from Dwelley to Rosen that Rosen forwarded to the trustee in July and October 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury rendered guilty verdicts on all four counts.  Prior to the end of trial, the district court denied Rosen's motion for judgment of acquittal.  On appeal, Rosen again argues that there was insufficient evidence to support a mail fraud conviction, in essence because there was not a binding employment agreement between Dwelley and the Kattars.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rosen's chief contention on appeal is that to support his conviction under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341, the government bore the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that a binding employment agreement existed between the purchaser, Dwelley, and Rosen's clients, the Kattars, that Rosen failed to disclose.  Thus, Rosen argues that either his motion for judgment of acquittal should have been granted--because such proof was not offered--or, in the alternative, his proposed jury instruction stating that proof of an employment agreement was necessary to support a guilty verdict should have been incorporated into the district court's instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without doubting that a binding employment agreement would have made Rosen's incomplete disclosures to the trustee more egregious, or more obviously illegal, we find that proving Rosen's failure to disclose a binding agreement was not a necessary prerequisite to establishing this mail fraud violation.  When the evidence is viewed as a whole, in the light most favorable to the verdict, drawing all credibility issues in favor of the verdict, as is appropriate in reviewing a sufficiency claim, see, e.g., United States v. Fulmer, 108 F.3d 1486, 1490 (1st Cir.1997), we see a set of facts that would be sufficient to \"allow a rational jury\" to render a guilty verdict.  Id.;  see also United States v. Batista-Polanco, 927 F.2d 14, 17 (1st Cir.1991) (stating standard of review for sufficiency claims).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The elements of a mail fraud offense under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> are:  (1) the defendant's knowing and willing participation in a scheme to defraud with a specific intent to defraud;  and (2) the use of the mails in furtherance of the scheme.  See United States v. Montminy, 936 F.2d 626, 627 (1st Cir.1991) (listing elements of mail fraud);  see also United States v. Ruiz, 105 F.3d 1492, 1501 (1st Cir.1997) (same).  A defendant need not have been successful in his scheme to defraud in order to be convicted under the mail fraud statute.  See United States v. Jordan, 112 F.3d 14, 19 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 118 S.Ct. 318, 139 L.Ed.2d 245 (1997).  Section 1341's scope is broad.  It covers deceptive schemes to deprive victims of a wide variety of tangible and intangible property interests;  such a scheme must, at a minimum, contemplate either some \"articulable harm\" befalling the fraud victim or \"some gainful use\" of the object of the fraudulent scheme by the perpetrator, regardless of whether this use is profitable in the economic sense.  United States v. Czubinski, 106 F.3d 1069, 1074-75 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Direct proof of fraudulent intent is often difficult to find, and thus we have long permitted the inference of fraudulent intent from circumstantial evidence.  See, e.g., United States v. Goodchild, 25 F.3d 55, 60 (1st Cir.1994).  Here, there was ample evidence to support the jury's conclusion that Rosen acted with the purpose of defrauding Tri-State's trustee in bankruptcy of amounts that a buyer, Orland Dwelley, was willing to pay for the debtor Tri-State's Maine property.  It is certainly not irrational to conclude that information regarding Dwelley's willingness to pay a total of one million dollars over time would have been valuable to the trustee, regardless of whether it was proven that Dwelley would have been willing to pay what he later paid, namely $730,000, at the time of his second offer of $500,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The letters between Rosen and Dwelley in July 1994 support the conclusion that a side agreement to employ the Kattars--and for Dwelley to thereby pay a total of approximately $1 million--existed.  The language of Dwelley's reply letter to Rosen dated July 14, 1994 is particularly telling, stating that \"[w]e (together with our associates) are willing to pay a total of $1,000,000 for the Property in approximately the following manner:  $500,000 upon delivery of a Deed ... and the balance ... over a period of years.\"   Comparing these letters with the testimony of the trustee and with the offer letters to the trustee indicates that Rosen was not forthcoming in his representations regarding the structure of the asset sale.  Furthermore, Rosen asked Dwelley in writing to \"not give [the trustee or his associate] the salary details about your agreement to hire the Kattar boys if the sale goes through.\"   All of this evidence can support a rational jury's conclusion that Rosen, in structuring the initial offer by Dwelley, sought to induce the trustee \"into believing that a $500,000 offer had been made to buy the Maine property, when in fact the offer was for $1 million,\" as Rosen's indictment alleged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rosen argues that any side agreement between the Kattars and Dwelley was not binding.  The side agreement need not have been binding, however, in order to establish that hiding the information from the trustee satisfied the element of a \"scheme or artifice to defraud\" in this case.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341.  A rational jury could have found that a legally non-binding agreement between Rosen and Dwelley regarding a $1 million dollar purchase price was intentionally kept hidden from the trustee, and that regardless of its non-binding nature, the trustee was thereby tricked into believing that $500,000 represented the extent of Dwelley's interest in the properties.  Simply put, from the point of view of the trustee, the value of the information that Rosen concealed derives from the fact that Dwelley may have been willing to pay more than $500,000 for the property--it does not turn on whether that interest was fixed in a legally binding agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A mail fraud conviction may be based on a defendant's \"deceptive conduct,\" a category that certainly may include the dissemination of incomplete information, where the specific intent to defraud exists.  McEvoy Travel Bureau, Inc. v. Heritage Travel, Inc., 904 F.2d 786, 791 (1st Cir.1990);  see also United States v. D'Amato, 39 F.3d 1249, 1257 (2d Cir.1994) (\" '[T]he withholding or inaccurate reporting of information that could impact on economic decisions can provide the basis for a mail fraud prosecution.' \")  (quoting United States v. Wallach, 935 F.2d 445, 462-63 (2d Cir.1991)).  The jury could choose not to believe Rosen's explanation for his failure to disclose the understanding reached with Dwelley, which is that he believed the trustee did not want to entertain offers that involved payments over time.  A rational jury could also infer an intent to harm the debtor estate, which under the most basic bankruptcy law principles is entitled to the full value of the consideration paid for an estate asset.  11 U.S.C. &#167; 541(a)(6);  see, e.g., United States v. Knight, 336 U.S. 505, 508, 69 S.Ct. 704, 706, 93 L.Ed. 845 (1949) (\"All the consideration which is paid for a bankrupt's assets becomes part of the estate.  No device or arrangement, however subtle, can subtract or divert any of it.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rosen also seems to argue that the indictment itself alleged that a binding employment agreement was part of the fraudulent scheme.  We might concur, but for the fact that Rosen himself described the correspondence with Dwelley as an \"agreement.\"   He cannot now be heard to complain about the government's and court's adoption of his own definition.  It follows that the district court did not err in failing to instruct the jury that it must find that a binding agreement between Dwelley and the Kattars was formed.  Our review of an alleged legal error in a jury instruction is de novo.   We find no error in the district court's instructions, which informed the jury that the government \"must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there was an agreement to pay additional money,\" and that gave an acceptable definition of an \"agreement\" as requiring that the parties manifest an agreement to the same terms.  As discussed above, the mail fraud statute plainly does not require that Rosen's deceptive behavior regarding a buyer's true level of interest be in relation to a binding, as opposed to a non-binding, agreement with the buyer to pay additional sums of money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, relying on United States v. D'Amato,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Rosen argues that, in the absence of a necessary harm resulting from the fraudulent scheme, the government had to prove Rosen's intent to defraud with independent evidence.  See D'Amato, 39 F.3d at 1257 (\"Where the scheme does not cause injury to the alleged victim as its necessary result, the government must produce evidence independent of the alleged scheme to show the defendant's fraudulent intent.\").  We disagree with the premise that Rosen's scheme does not necessarily contemplate a harm.  Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, we see an attempt to prevent all of the proceeds of an asset sale from going to the debtor's estate itself.  To deprive the trustee of a debtor in bankruptcy of accurate information regarding greater amounts that a potential buyer is willing to pay is harm enough.  Compare with Czubinski, 106 F.3d at 1074 (no deprivation of property interest in confidential information for purposes of federal fraud statute where no gainful use or other articulable harm followed from mere browsing of taxpayer files).  Here, once the side agreement was unearthed, the trustee took quick steps to dissolve the approved $500,000 sale, and eventually sold the property to the same buyer at $730,000.  The two cases cited by Rosen in support of his contention that no harm is implicated here are readily distinguishable on the facts.  See United States v. Jain, 93 F.3d 436 (8th Cir.1996), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 2452, 138 L.Ed.2d 210 (1997) (reversing conviction where there was no evidence of harm to patients from scheme in which hospital paid kickbacks to referring psychologist);  United States v. Ashman, 979 F.2d 469, 479 (7th Cir.1993) (violation of a commodity brokerage practice not a deprivation of property because customer would have received identical price).  Unlike in Jain and Ashman, the scheme at issue here threatened to place its victim in a tangibly worse position, namely one in which a trustee could not extract the maximum value for the debtor's assets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The other approach discussed in the letter was reaching an understanding with the holders of the mortgage on the Maine properties to buy the property from the Trustee and then sell it to Griffen</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341 (Supp.1997) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p>Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises ... for the purposes of executing such scheme or artifice or attempting to do so, places in any post office or authorized depository for mail matter, any matter or thing whatever to be sent or delivered by the Postal Service, ... or takes or receives therefrom, ... any such matter or thing, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Rosen cites United States v.

Gonzalez-Maldonado, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197384\"><a href=\"/opinion/197384/united-states-v-gonzalez-maldonado/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 12 (1st Cir.1997), unless presented with a claim that suggests that the jury's balanced assessment of the evidence was itself somehow tainted, see United States v.

On this appeal, we are limited to the evidence and inferences most favorable to the verdict, and on this basis the following facts could have been found by the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rosen served as legal counsel to the owners and operators of New England Tri-State Development Corporation (\"Tri-State\").  Tri-State, which was owned and operated by George and Kevin Kattar, operated a golf course in Massachusetts and held an approximately 1,100 acre parcel of undeveloped land in Maine.  In April 1992, Tri-State filed a voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At some point in the winter of 1993-94, Kevin Kattar told Rosen that a Maine lumberman named Michael Griffen was potentially interested in purchasing the Maine property for a total of approximately $1 million, to be paid in installments.  Griffen was in contact with another Maine lumberman, Orland Dwelley, who also had some interest in purchasing and developing the Maine property.  In March 1994, the Tri-State case was converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation, and Joseph Braunstein was appointed as trustee.  During the Chapter 7 conversion hearing, Rosen, appearing as the debtor Tri-State's attorney, stated that Tri-State had received an offer of $500,000 for the Maine property, and also stated that Tri-State believed the property to be worth $750,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the conversion, and no later than May 1994, Rosen began negotiating a possible sale price with Griffen.  Although Kevin Kattar sought a $1 million sale price during a meeting with Griffen and Rosen on May 25, 1994, no concrete terms were assented to.  In a letter of May 16, 1994, Rosen indicated to the trustee that Rosen was attempting to find a buyer for the Maine property at a price of \"$500,000 cash.\"   In a letter to Griffen dated June 6, 1994, Rosen stated that, based on the May 25, 1994 meeting with Griffen in Boston, it was Rosen's understanding that Griffen wished to \"buy the above property ... at a total cost to you which will not exceed $1,000,000.00, including legal and consulting fees, payable no more than $525,000.00 upon delivery of good, clear, and marketable title ... and any balance over up to four years.\"   The June 6, 1994 letter to Griffen also suggested two approaches to selling the Maine property, one of which was the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>2.  Having you make an offer to purchase directly to the trustee for $500,000 cash and then hiring Kevin and George Kattar to help you develop the property at a salary of $60,000.00 per year each on a four year employment contract.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Griffen did not sign or return Rosen's letter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soon, it became clear that Orland Dwelley, and not Griffen, would be the most likely purchaser and developer of the Maine property.  Rosen telephoned Dwelley to discuss a sale at a net price of $1 million, with $500,000 to be paid up front.  On July 12, 1994, Rosen sent a letter to Dwelley stating that the offer price was for $500,000, and adding the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>In addition, our understanding is that you, with Mr. Griffin, will engage the Kattar boys as your consultants for a total amount of $475,000, payable over four years in monthly payments totalling $9896.00 (each of the two Kattars to receive one-half, or $4948.00 per month).  Lastly, you will pay me a fee of $25,000.00 if you are successful at acquiring the property, but not otherwise, payable at closing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dwelley signed and returned an attached letter dated July 14, 1994, which Rosen had prepared, stating in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>we (together with our associates) are prepared to pay the sum of $1,000,000 for the Property in approximately the following manner:  $500,000 upon delivery of a Deed conveying good record and marketable title, ... and the balance (less our expenses for your services) over a period of years (not to exceed five) either by way of a secured note or consulting fees, secured by a lien on the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>For your services as aforesaid, we will pay you the sum of $25,000, plus actual expenses, at Closing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rosen also drafted an offer letter from Dwelley to the trustee, which stated a $500,000 offer price but did not mention any further payments to be made to either the Kattars or Rosen.  The offer letter, which was signed by Dwelley and forwarded by Rosen to the trustee on July 18, 1994, stated that \"we would expect to seek to employ one or more of the former officers of Tri-State to assist us in marketing the property,\" but did not provide any further details.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rosen never disclosed to the trustee the substance of the employment relationship discussed in his correspondence with Dwelley.  Rosen did not provide the trustee with a copy of the July 14, 1994 letter that Dwelley signed.  When the trustee questioned Rosen on July 25, 1994 about the reference in Dwelley's offer letter to the possible employment of \"one or more of the former officers\" of Tri-State, Rosen told the trustee that there \"was nothing definite as far as what the compensation [would be] or even if they would be employed.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a letter to Dwelley dated August 2, 1994, Rosen wrote:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>I forgot to mention in our telephone conversation that if you get a call from the Trustee, whose name is Joseph Braunstein, or his associate ... I would prefer that you not give either of them the salary details about your agreement to hire the Kattar boys if the sale goes through.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rosen used another attorney, John Rodman, as the attorney of record for Dwelley.  When Rodman asked Rosen if there had been any specific employment arrangements for the Kattars, Rosen told him that there was nothing in writing and no specific agreement, which information Rodman later relayed to the trustee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1994, the trustee ultimately accepted Dwelley's second written offer for the Maine properties, which again offered $500,000, but with a higher initial deposit.  That offer tracked the language of the first offer letter and had been mailed to Rosen, who then forwarded it to the trustee.  The trustee sought bankruptcy court approval for the sale.  On January 3, 1995, Rosen attended the bankruptcy court hearing on the motion to sell the property to Dwelley, and said nothing to contradict the notion that Dwelley's $500,000 was the best available offer for the debtor's Maine property, or to indicate that a larger offer of $1 million had been contemplated by Dwelley.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before the scheduled closing, an attorney working for Dwelley in Maine asked Rosen to explain the employment arrangement regarding the Kattars.  That attorney, Laurie Dart, then informed the trustee that there may have been additional arrangements for future payments to the Kattars.  Upon hearing of the previously undisclosed arrangements, the trustee filed a motion to revoke the court-approved sale of the Maine property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the fall of 1995, the trustee ultimately received a third offer from Dwelley, and entered into an agreement to sell the Maine property to Dwelley for $730,000 in cash.  No terms regarding any subsequent payments (or regarding the Kattars' employment) were part of the final sale transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the government sought to prove that Rosen's failure to disclose information regarding what the government referred to as the \"side agreement\" with Dwelley was a fraudulent scheme intended to prevent the trustee from receiving as much as possible from the sale of the debtor's estate.  Specifically, Rosen was charged with using the mails in the course of tricking the trustee into approving a $500,000 sale which in fact was a $1 million dollar sale, with the remainder to be paid to the Kattars and Rosen.  The four counts of Rosen's indictment under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341 comprised of two mailings related to each of Dwelley's two offers to purchase the property for $500,000--including mailings from Dwelley to Rosen that Rosen forwarded to the trustee in July and October 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury rendered guilty verdicts on all four counts.  Prior to the end of trial, the district court denied Rosen's motion for judgment of acquittal.  On appeal, Rosen again argues that there was insufficient evidence to support a mail fraud conviction, in essence because there was not a binding employment agreement between Dwelley and the Kattars.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rosen's chief contention on appeal is that to support his conviction under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341, the government bore the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that a binding employment agreement existed between the purchaser, Dwelley, and Rosen's clients, the Kattars, that Rosen failed to disclose.  Thus, Rosen argues that either his motion for judgment of acquittal should have been granted--because such proof was not offered--or, in the alternative, his proposed jury instruction stating that proof of an employment agreement was necessary to support a guilty verdict should have been incorporated into the district court's instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without doubting that a binding employment agreement would have made Rosen's incomplete disclosures to the trustee more egregious, or more obviously illegal, we find that proving Rosen's failure to disclose a binding agreement was not a necessary prerequisite to establishing this mail fraud violation.  When the evidence is viewed as a whole, in the light most favorable to the verdict, drawing all credibility issues in favor of the verdict, as is appropriate in reviewing a sufficiency claim, see, e.g., United States v. Fulmer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197264\"><a href=\"/opinion/197264/united-states-v-fulmer/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1486</span></a></span>, 1490 (1st Cir.1997), we see a set of facts that would be sufficient to \"allow a rational jury\" to render a guilty verdict.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">245</span></span> (1997).  Section 1341's scope is broad.  It covers deceptive schemes to deprive victims of a wide variety of tangible and intangible property interests;  such a scheme must, at a minimum, contemplate either some \"articulable harm\" befalling the fraud victim or \"some gainful use\" of the object of the fraudulent scheme by the perpetrator, regardless of whether this use is profitable in the economic sense.  United States v. Czubinski, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197216\"><a href=\"/opinion/197216/united-states-v-czubinski/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1069</span></a></span>, 1074-75 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Direct proof of fraudulent intent is often difficult to find, and thus we have long permitted the inference of fraudulent intent from circumstantial evidence.  See, e.g., United States v.

Here, there was ample evidence to support the jury's conclusion that Rosen acted with the purpose of defrauding Tri-State's trustee in bankruptcy of amounts that a buyer, Orland Dwelley, was willing to pay for the debtor Tri-State's Maine property.  It is certainly not irrational to conclude that information regarding Dwelley's willingness to pay a total of one million dollars over time would have been valuable to the trustee, regardless of whether it was proven that Dwelley would have been willing to pay what he later paid, namely $730,000, at the time of his second offer of $500,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The letters between Rosen and Dwelley in July 1994 support the conclusion that a side agreement to employ the Kattars--and for Dwelley to thereby pay a total of approximately $1 million--existed.  The language of Dwelley's reply letter to Rosen dated July 14, 1994 is particularly telling, stating that \"[w]e (together with our associates) are willing to pay a total of $1,000,000 for the Property in approximately the following manner:  $500,000 upon delivery of a Deed ... and the balance ... over a period of years.\"   Comparing these letters with the testimony of the trustee and with the offer letters to the trustee indicates that Rosen was not forthcoming in his representations regarding the structure of the asset sale.  Furthermore, Rosen asked Dwelley in writing to \"not give [the trustee or his associate] the salary details about your agreement to hire the Kattar boys if the sale goes through.\"   All of this evidence can support a rational jury's conclusion that Rosen, in structuring the initial offer by Dwelley, sought to induce the trustee \"into believing that a $500,000 offer had been made to buy the Maine property, when in fact the offer was for $1 million,\" as Rosen's indictment alleged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rosen argues that any side agreement between the Kattars and Dwelley was not binding.  The side agreement need not have been binding, however, in order to establish that hiding the information from the trustee satisfied the element of a \"scheme or artifice to defraud\" in this case.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341.  A rational jury could have found that a legally non-binding agreement between Rosen and Dwelley regarding a $1 million dollar purchase price was intentionally kept hidden from the trustee, and that regardless of its non-binding nature, the trustee was thereby tricked into believing that $500,000 represented the extent of Dwelley's interest in the properties.  Simply put, from the point of view of the trustee, the value of the information that Rosen concealed derives from the fact that Dwelley may have been willing to pay more than $500,000 for the property--it does not turn on whether that interest was fixed in a legally binding agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A mail fraud conviction may be based on a defendant's \"deceptive conduct,\" a category that certainly may include the dissemination of incomplete information, where the specific intent to defraud exists.

The jury could choose not to believe Rosen's explanation for his failure to disclose the understanding reached with Dwelley, which is that he believed the trustee did not want to entertain offers that involved payments over time.  A rational jury could also infer an intent to harm the debtor estate, which under the most basic bankruptcy law principles is entitled to the full value of the consideration paid for an estate asset.  11 U.S.C. &#167; 541(a)(6);  see, e.g., United States v. Knight, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104650\"><a href=\"/opinion/104650/united-states-v-knight/\"><span class=\"volume\">336</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">505</span></a></span>, 508, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104650\"><a href=\"/opinion/104650/united-states-v-knight/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We might concur, but for the fact that Rosen himself described the correspondence with Dwelley as an \"agreement.\"   He cannot now be heard to complain about the government's and court's adoption of his own definition.  It follows that the district court did not err in failing to instruct the jury that it must find that a binding agreement between Dwelley and the Kattars was formed.  Our review of an alleged legal error in a jury instruction is de novo.   We find no error in the district court's instructions, which informed the jury that the government \"must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there was an agreement to pay additional money,\" and that gave an acceptable definition of an \"agreement\" as requiring that the parties manifest an agreement to the same terms.  As discussed above, the mail fraud statute plainly does not require that Rosen's deceptive behavior regarding a buyer's true level of interest be in relation to a binding, as opposed to a non-binding, agreement with the buyer to pay additional sums of money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, relying on United States v. D'Amato,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Rosen argues that, in the absence of a necessary harm resulting from the fraudulent scheme, the government had to prove Rosen's intent to defraud with independent evidence.  See D'Amato, 39 F.3d at 1257 (\"Where the scheme does not cause injury to the alleged victim as its necessary result, the government must produce evidence independent of the alleged scheme to show the defendant's fraudulent intent.\").  We disagree with the premise that Rosen's scheme does not necessarily contemplate a harm.  Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, we see an attempt to prevent all of the proceeds of an asset sale from going to the debtor's estate itself.  To deprive the trustee of a debtor in bankruptcy of accurate information regarding greater amounts that a potential buyer is willing to pay is harm enough.  Compare with Czubinski, 106 F.3d at 1074 (no deprivation of property interest in confidential information for purposes of federal fraud statute where no gainful use or other articulable harm followed from mere browsing of taxpayer files).  Here, once the side agreement was unearthed, the trustee took quick steps to dissolve the approved $500,000 sale, and eventually sold the property to the same buyer at $730,000.  The two cases cited by Rosen in support of his contention that no harm is implicated here are readily distinguishable on the facts.  See United States v. Jain, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"724923\"><a href=\"/opinion/724923/united-states-of-america-plaintiff-appelleecross-v-swaran-kumar-jain/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span> (8th Cir.1996), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
