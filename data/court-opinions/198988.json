In this case, the Town of\n\nNorwood, Massachusetts, seeks review of orders of the Federal\n\nEnergy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\") denying Norwood's petition\n\nfor declaratory rulings.       The case is a sequel to Town of\n\nNorwood v. FERC, 202 F.3d 392 (1st Cir.), petition for cert.\n\nfiled (U.S. May 30, 2000) (No. 99-1914) (\"Norwood I\"), in which\n\nthis court sustained related FERC orders.           See also Town of\n\nNorwood v.    New England Power Co., 202 F.3d 408 (1st Cir.),\n\npetition for cert. filed (U.S. May 30, 2000) (No. 99-1913)\n\n(\"Norwood    II\").   The    pertinent   facts,   for   which   detailed\n\nbackground can be found in Norwood I and II, are as follows.\n\n            For many years, New England Power Company was a major\n\nintegrated electric utility in New England:        it generated power,\n\ndistributed it as a wholesaler to affiliates and non-affiliates\n\nalike, and retailed power through its local affiliates such as\n\nMassachusetts    Electric   Company.    Norwood,    which   operates   a\n\nmunicipal electric company that distributes retail power to\n\nresidents and businesses in the town, was a long-time purchaser\n\nof power from Boston Edison Company, but in 1983 Norwood began\n\nto purchase power instead from New England Power.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f            This opportunity to switch power suppliers was secured\n\nafter Norwood settled an antitrust case against Boston Edison\n\nand New England Power.      See Norwood II, 202 F.3d at 412.           The\n\nsettlement agreement obligated New England Power to furnish, and\n\nNorwood   to    accept,   sufficient    power   to   satisfy     Norwood's\n\nrequirements for electricity through October 31, 1998.                 The\n\npower was to be supplied pursuant to New England Power's FERC\n\nTariff No. 1--the same wholesale tariff under which New England\n\nPower then supplied electricity to its own retail affiliates--\n\n\"as [it] may be amended from time to time.\"           Id.\n\n            The requirements contract provided that its term was\n\nfrom November 1, 1983, to October 31, 1998, but it also stated\n\nthat \"[n]either [New England Power] nor Norwood will give notice\n\nof termination prior to November 1, 1991 and shall not specify\n\na termination date prior to November 1, 1998.\"                 New England\n\nPower's FERC Tariff No. 1, incorporated by reference in its\n\npower   contract   with   Norwood,     said   that   \"[o]nce    initiated,\n\nservice under this tariff shall continue until terminated by\n\neither party giving to the other at least seven years' written\n\nnotice of termination. . . .\"\n\n            Thereafter, the parties twice amended the requirements\n\ncontract.      First, in 1987 the contract was amended to permit\n\nNorwood to take advantage of allocations of lower-cost power\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\ffrom the New York Power Authority.        Second, in 1989 the parties\n\namended the contract to permit Norwood at its election to extend\n\nthe earliest date on which notice of termination could be given\n\nfrom November 1, 1991, to November 1, 2001.\n\n           On July 25, 1990, Norwood sent a letter to New England\n\nPower stating that Norwood \"hereby gives notice . . . that it\n\nextends the date\" for giving notice of termination from November\n\n1, 1991, to November 1, 2001.            The letter continued:       \"The\n\neffect of this is that the Power Contract between [New England\n\nPower]   and    Norwood   would   be   extended   for   [ten]   years   to\n\nmidnight, October 31, 2008 . . . .\"        Whether Norwood did intend\n\nto extend the contract and whether the extension was effective\n\nare principal issues in this case.\n\n           Beginning in December 1996, New England Power made a\n\nset of regulatory filings to restructure itself and to revise\n\nits existing tariff for wholesale power sales.             These filings,\n\ndescribed in detail and upheld in Norwood I, aimed to secure\n\nFERC approval for the sale of New England Power's non-nuclear\n\ngenerating facilities, the release (on payment of termination\n\ncharges)   of    affiliates   from     their   long-term    requirements\n\ncontracts with New England Power, and the restructuring of New\n\nEngland Power's wholesale rates to facilitate customer choice\n\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fand    market-based     pricing     at   both       the    wholesale    and    retail\n\nlevels.    Norwood I, 202 F.3d at 396-97.\n\n           In a set of orders issued between November 1997 and\n\nJune    1998,   FERC    approved      the      sale,      early    termination     by\n\naffiliates on payment of termination charges, the restructuring\n\nof wholesale rates, and a \"rate freeze\" on New England Power's\n\nexisting    charges         with   wholesale        contract      purchasers     like\n\nNorwood.    This freeze was instituted because under the existing\n\ncontracts, rates were normally adjusted to reflect increased\n\ncosts, and New England Power was now divesting itself of its\n\nlow-cost non-nuclear plants.             Norwood II, 202 F.3d at 413.\n\n           Norwood concluded that under the new regime it would\n\nbe disadvantaged vis-à-vis New England Power's retail affiliates\n\nwhom Norwood regards as retail competitors.                   See Norwood II, 202\n\nF.3d at 414.         On March 4, 1998, Norwood notified New England\n\nPower    that   it    was    switching    to    a    new    wholesale    supplier,\n\nNortheast Utilities.           Two weeks later, on March 18, 1998, New\n\nEngland Power filed a revised FERC Tariff No. 1 permitting\n\ndissident wholesale customers like Norwood to terminate their\n\ncontracts early and on only thirty days' notice, conditioned on\n\nthe customers paying a contract termination charge based on an\n\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\favoided cost theory.1        New England Power Co., 83 F.E.R.C. ¶\n\n61,174, reh'g denied, 84 F.E.R.C. ¶ 61,175 (1998).\n\n           To counter New England Power's March 18, 1998, tariff\n\nfiling, Norwood not only objected to the charge before FERC, see\n\nNorwood I, 202 F.3d at 398, but also, in an effort to shorten\n\nthe period of liability, Norwood petitioned FERC in April 1999\n\nfor a declaratory order, 18 C.F.R. § 385.207 (1999), that its\n\ncontract with New England Power had terminated on October 31,\n\n1998, and that New England Power therefore had no basis for\n\nclaiming   any   contract    termination    charges   after   that   date.\n\nNorwood estimates that if fully allowed, the charges will exceed\n\n$7 million per year until 2008.\n\n           FERC dismissed Norwood's petition on the merits on June\n\n21, 1999, Town of Norwood, 87 F.E.R.C. ¶ 61,341 (1999).                In a\n\nnutshell, the Commission found that Norwood had extended the\n\ncontract through October 31, 2008, by its July 25, 1990, letter;\n\nand it concluded that New England Power's failure to file that\n\nletter with FERC was irrelevant.            On August 20, 1999, FERC\n\ndenied   without   opinion    Norwood's    motion   for   rehearing,   and\n\n\n    1The contract termination charge is computed as the revenues\nthat New England Power would have expected to collect had the\ncustomer continued to pay at the now frozen tariff rate through\nthe earliest date that the customer could have unilaterally\nterminated service under the contract, less the expected costs\navoided by New England Power because it did not have to provide\nthe power.\n\n                                  -6-\n\fNorwood    has   sought    review     in   this       court    to    challenge      the\n\nCommission's orders, 16 U.S.C. § 825l(b).\n\n            Norwood's arguments on appeal, which we address in a\n\nsequence    somewhat      different    from       Norwood's         brief,    are    in\n\nsubstance five:      (1) that the requirements contract with New\n\nEngland Power was never extended beyond October 31, 1998; (2)\n\nthat any extension premised on the July 25, 1990, letter is\n\nineffective because the letter was not filed with FERC and\n\nbecause reliance upon it violates the so-called filed rate\n\ndoctrine;   (3) that the FERC order unilaterally altered the\n\ncontract in disregard of the Mobile-Sierra doctrine; (4) that\n\nthe failure to file the letter prevents FERC from relying on it\n\nin   construing    the    contract;        and    (5)       that    FERC    committed\n\nprocedural error.\n\n            Assuming arguendo that the July 25, 1990, letter was\n\nrightly    considered,     it   is    clear      to    us    that    FERC    properly\n\nconstrued the contract to extend Norwood's obligation to take\n\nits requirements from New England Power until October 31, 2008.\n\nThe standard of review need not be considered because, even if\n\nreview of the contract interpretation question were de novo, our\n\nreading would still be precisely that of the Commission.                            Cf.\n\nBoston Edison Co. v. FERC, 856 F.2d 361, 363-64 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\nThe documents may be inartfully drafted, but taken together,\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fthey make clear that Norwood's contract interpretation argument\n\nis hopeless.\n\n           It is arguable that even without the July 25, 1990,\n\nletter, the proper reading of the original 1983 contract made it\n\nself-extending absent notice of termination.2           However, there is\n\nno reason to decide how matters would stand if there had been no\n\n1989 amendment and letter.           Norwood's July 25, 1990, letter\n\ntriggered a provision in the 1989 amendment to the original 1983\n\ncontract   and   when   both   the    amendment   and   the   letter   are\n\nconsidered, it is crystal clear that--subject to any other\n\npossible   legal   barrier--Norwood's       obligation     was   extended\n\nthrough October 31, 2008.\n\n           The 1989 amendment explicitly replaced the article of\n\nthe 1983 agreement specifying the term of the contract with a\n\nnew article which specified that the contract continued through\n\nmidnight, October 31, 1998, except:        (1) neither side could give\n\nnotice of termination prior to November 1, 1991, or specify a\n\ntermination date prior to November 1, 1998; and (2):\n\n             Norwood may elect to extend the earliest\n           date by which either party can give notice\n           of intent to terminate service by a total of\n\n\n    2The original contract said that its term was through\nOctober 31, 1998, but FERC Tariff No. 1. said that seven years'\nnotice is required to terminate; while the contract has an\noverrule provision, it is not clear that the two terms are\ninconsistent.\n\n                                     -8-\n\f            [twenty] years in two ten-year increments.\n            In order to exercise this election, Norwood\n            agrees to provide [New England Power] with\n            written notice of each such election at\n            least one year prior to the date that it is\n            to be extended, viz, to November 1, 2001\n            initially   and   to   November   1,   2011\n            ultimately.\n\nCiting this amended article, Norwood on July 25, 1990, wrote New\n\nEngland Power giving notice that it extended the date by which\n\neither side could give notice of an intent to terminate \"to\n\nNovember 1, 2001.     The effect of this is that the Power Contract\n\nbetween [New England Power] and Norwood would be extended for\n\n[ten] years to midnight, October 31, 2008 . . . .\"\n\n            Norwood argues that the letter was an offer that New\n\nEngland Power failed to accept; but the 1989 amendment, which\n\nNorwood explicitly invokes in the 1990 letter, gives Norwood a\n\nunilateral election to extend by written notice, which is just\n\nwhat the 1990 letter comprises.      Norwood also says that the 1990\n\nletter merely extends the earliest date on which the notice of\n\ntermination can be given and does not extend the agreement\n\nitself; but this is just word play in the context of this\n\ncontract.\n\n            Norwood   makes   a   further   contract   interpretation\n\nargument based on the 1987 amendment which was designed to allow\n\nNorwood to reduce its obligation to purchase from New England\n\nPower to the extent that Norwood could obtain a lower-cost\n\n                                  -9-\n\fallocation      from    the    New    York    Power    Authority.       Norwood's\n\nexplanation as to how this 1987 amendment supports its position\n\nis not persuasive enough to merit detailed response.                    The short\n\nanswer is that the 1987 amendment, which had a quite limited\n\nfocus, was followed by a 1989 amendment providing Norwood an\n\nelection   to    extend       the    obligations      through   2008;   and   this\n\nprovision for an election, which Norwood exercised, controls any\n\nprior terms, whether adopted in 1983 or in 1987.\n\n           Norwood's second multi-part argument is that the July\n\n25, 1990, letter was ineffective to extend the contract until\n\n2008   because    the    letter       was    never    filed   with   FERC.     The\n\ngoverning provision of the Federal Power Act provides that\n\nutilities subject to its terms, which includes New England Power\n\nwith respect to wholesale power sales, must file with FERC:\n\n           schedules showing all rates and charges for\n           any transmission or sale subject to the\n           jurisdiction of the Commission, and the\n           classifications, practices, and regulations\n           affecting such rates and charges, together\n           with all contracts which in any manner\n           affect or relate to such rates, charges,\n           classifications, and services.\n\n16 U.S.C. § 824d(c) (1994) (emphasis added).                    The statute also\n\nrequires that any change in a rate or contract must be reflected\n\nin a filing with the Commission which, absent a waiver, must be\n\nmade in advance of the effective date and on sixty days' notice.\n\nId. § 824d(d).\n\n                                        -10-\n\f          Although the statute does not say so explicitly, it\n\nmight be read as saying that an unfiled contract is ineffective;\n\nand in any event, FERC regulations say that a public utility may\n\nnot (to shorten the language to pertinent terms) \"collect . . .\n\nany rate\" or \"impose any . . . contract\" for FERC-regulated\n\nservice   \"which   is   different    from    that    provided    in     a   rate\n\nschedule required to be on file with this Commission unless\n\notherwise specifically provided by order of the Commission for\n\ngood cause shown.\"      18 C.F.R. § 35.1(e) (1999).         \"Rate schedule\"\n\nis defined to include both a statement of rates and charges for\n\nelectric service and \"all classifications, practices, rules,\n\nregulations or contracts which in any manner affect or relate to\n\nthe aforementioned service, rates, and charges.\"                 Id. § 35.2.\n\nThe importance attributed to filings is reinforced by the so-\n\ncalled filed rate doctrine.\n\n          The filed rate doctrine, discussed at greater length\n\nin   Norwood II, 202 F.3d at 416, 418-22, is actually a set of\n\nrules that have evolved over time but revolve around the notion\n\nthat under statutes like the Federal Power Act, utility filings\n\nwith the regulatory agency prevail over unfiled contracts or\n\nother   claims   seeking    different      rates    or   terms   than       those\n\nreflected in the filings with the agency.                See, e.g., AT&T v.\n\nCentral Office Tel., Inc., 524 U.S. 214, 221-24 (1998); Montana-\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fDakota Utils. v. Northwestern Pub. Serv. Co., 341 U.S. 246, 251-\n\n52 (1951).    Norwood's theory is that the unfiled July 25, 1990,\n\nletter was ineffective because not filed (as required by statute\n\nand regulations) and because giving the unfiled letter effect\n\nwould violate the filed rate doctrine.\n\n            In both variations, Norwood's argument depends on the\n\nproposition    that    the   July   25,    1990,   letter    was    a   contract\n\nrequired to be filed.        The gist of the Commission's holding is\n\nthat the contract was what was set forth in the 1983 contract\n\nand the 1989 amendment, both of which were filed with the\n\nCommission; the letter merely exercised an election already\n\nspelled out in those filings.             The Commission also gave other\n\nalternative reasons for relying on the 1990 letter, which we\n\nwill defer for the present.\n\n            The reference in the statute and regulations to the\n\nfiling   of   \"contracts\"     which      affect    rates    and    services     is\n\nambiguous.     On the one hand, the July 25, 1990, letter is not\n\nitself a contract in common usage; it is the exercise of a\n\nunilateral election by one party under an already existing\n\ncontract.     On the other hand, the election had the effect of\n\nextending the contract term by multiple years, albeit within the\n\nframework of the existing contract.           If the Commission wanted to\n\ncharacterize    such    notices     as    \"contracts,\"      it     would   be    a\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\flinguistic    stretch      but   arguably     within      the   Commission's\n\nauthority to construe its organic statute and regulations.\n\n            However, the Commission has construed the statute and\n\nregulations    not   to    encompass   a   notice    of   election   already\n\nprovided for by a duly filed contract.              This interpretation is\n\nsubject to substantial deference under the Chevron doctrine.3\n\nFurther, in the Towns of Concord and Wellesley v. FERC, 844 F.2d\n\n891 (1st Cir. 1988), this court upheld a decision of FERC giving\n\neffect to an unfiled letter terminating a provision in a filed\n\nagreement    where   the    agreement      itself    contemplated    such   a\n\ntermination letter.        The analogy offered was to automatic rate\n\nadjustment clauses which, \"[o]nce the rate schedule is approved,\n\n[permit] rate adjustments [to] be made in accordance with the\n\ninternally-prescribed        automatic      adjustment      clause   without\n\nfurther notice to action by the Commission.\"              Id. at 896 (citing\n\n16 U.S.C. § 824d(f)); see also Transwestern Pipeline v. FERC,\n\n897 F.2d 570, 578 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 952\n\n(1990).\n\n            Norwood counters by citing Arkansas Louisiana Gas Co.\n\nv.

Mississippi, 487 U.S. 354, 380-82 (1988) (Scalia,\nJ., concurring); City of Cleveland v. FERC, 773 F.2d 1368, 1376\n(D.C.

There, the Supreme Court held that a filed\n\ntariff rate for the purchase of natural gas prevailed over\n\nArkla's promise, made in a filed agreement, to pay a higher rate\n\nif Arkla paid more to other producers (the \"favored nations\"\n\nclause).     But the Supreme Court stressed that it was unclear\n\nwhether FERC would have accepted the higher rate resulting from\n\nthe favored nations clause--by contrast to our case; and FERC\n\nsaid    in   Arkla that its acceptance of the contract did not\n\nconstitute pre-approval of any rate generated by the favored\n\nnations clause.         See Arkla, 453 U.S. at 578-82 & n.11.\n\n             Needless to say, without the filing of the July 25,\n\n1990, letter, no outsider could visit the Commission's files and\n\ndetermine       whether the election to extend had been exercised.\n\nThis provides whatever policy argument there might be for a\n\nbroad interpretation of \"contracts\" in the statute.                  But even in\n\nthe    halcyon    days   of    strict    public     utility   regulation,   now\n\nreceding at FERC as elsewhere, see Norwood I, 202 F.3d at 396,\n\nthere    were    gaps    in    what   could    be   gleaned   from   Commission\n\nfilings.     And this is the kind of grey area--the determination\n\nof just what the Commission needs to have filed beyond formal\n\ncontracts themselves--in which great weight must be given to the\n\nCommission's judgment.            City of Cleveland v. FERC, 773 F.2d\n\n1368, 1376 (D.C. Cir. 1985).\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\f            We    thus    conclude       that   the    Commission     did    not    act\n\ncontrary to the Federal Power Act or its own regulations in\n\ngiving    effect    to    the   unfiled        July   25,   1990,    letter    as    an\n\nelection to extend the term of the contract.                   By the same token\n\nit   is   unnecessary      to   elaborate       on    the   filed    rate   doctrine\n\nbecause giving effect to the notice does not circumvent any\n\nfiling requirement or contradict any extant filing.                           This is\n\nenough to resolve the claims made by Norwood and makes it\n\nunnecessary for us to consider what we regard as more doubtful\n\nalternative reasons given by the Commission for its order.\n\n            Third,        because        we      accept       the     Commission's\n\ninterpretation of the July 25, 1990, letter as representing\n\nNorwood's election to extend its contract to 2008, the Mobile-\n\nSierra    doctrine       invoked    by    Norwood      does   not    apply.        That\n\ndoctrine    prohibits       a   regulated        utility      from    unilaterally\n\nchanging    the    fixed    terms    of    a    utilities     contract      absent    a\n\nfinding by FERC that the existing term adversely affects the\n\npublic interest.         FPC v. Sierra Pacific Power co., 350 U.S. 348,\n\n353-55 (1956); United Gas Pipe Line v. Mobile Gas Serv. Corp.,\n\n350 U.S. 332, 343-45 (1956).              FERC's reasonable construction of\n\na contract in favor of a public utility is not a unilateral\n\nchange in the contract.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\f          In its fourth argument for reversal, Norwood argues\n\nthat, if New England Power was not required to file the July 25,\n\n1990, letter, then FERC lacked the authority to interpret it.\n\nThis might be so if the letter's subject matter were outside\n\nFERC's   jurisdiction--for   example,   if   it   addressed   only\n\nintrastate power sales.   Cf. Pennzoil v. FERC, 645 F.2d 360, 382\n\n(5th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1142 (1982).     However,\n\nthere is no doubt that the letter in this case related to a\n\nfiled contract for the wholesale supply of electric power within\n\nFERC's jurisdiction.\n\n          FERC sometimes declines to address contract issues even\n\nfor sales unquestionably within its jurisdiction,      see, e.g.,\n\nSouthern Cal. Edison Co., 85 F.E.R.C. ¶ 61,023 (1998), but\n\nNorwood makes no claim that FERC is forbidden from interpreting\n\ncontracts filed with FERC or otherwise relevant to FERC tariffs.\n\nHere, the duration of the contract directly affects Norwood's\n\nliability under the March 1998 tariff imposing a termination\n\ncharge; and Norwood itself sought the declaration from FERC as\n\nto whether the contract continued past October 1998.   The letter\n\nwas properly considered as a document pertinent to determining\n\nthe duration of the contract.     Cf. Southern Union Co. v. FERC,\n\n857 F.2d 812, 815-16 (D.C. Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 493 U.S.\n\n1072 (1990).\n\n\n                                -16-\n\f              Finally, Norwood offers a procedural objection to the\n\nCommission's proceedings.            After FERC issued its notice of the\n\nfiling of Norwood's petition for a declaratory ruling, FERC\n\ngranted New England Power leave to intervene out of time, and it\n\naccepted      New   England    Power's      answer   to    Norwood's       petition.\n\nNorwood now complains because FERC then denied Norwood's motion\n\nfor   leave    to   file   a   reply,    citing      a    FERC   procedural     rule\n\nprohibiting answers to answers.                 18 C.F.R. § 385.213(a)(2)\n\n(1999).\n\n              Perhaps in some situations it might be improper for an\n\nagency effectively to deny the petitioner the right to respond\n\nto    assertions     raised    for    the    first       time    in   an   answering\n\ndocument, although refusal to allow a formal \"reply\" is not\n\nautomatically the same as precluding evidence or argument.                       The\n\nshort answer in this case is that nothing in Norwood's proffered\n\nreply, which is included in the appendix filed with this court,\n\nalters the result:         in general, the reply sets forth arguments\n\nthat were effectively addressed by FERC in its orders or could\n\nnot affect the outcome in light of dispositive rulings by FERC.\n\n              The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\f",

The    pertinent   facts,   for   which   detailed\n\nbackground can be found in Norwood I and II, are as follows.\n\n            For many years, New England Power Company was a major\n\nintegrated electric utility in New England:        it generated power,\n\ndistributed it as a wholesaler to affiliates and non-affiliates\n\nalike, and retailed power through its local affiliates such as\n\nMassachusetts    Electric   Company.    Norwood,    which   operates   a\n\nmunicipal electric company that distributes retail power to\n\nresidents and businesses in the town, was a long-time purchaser\n\nof power from Boston Edison Company, but in 1983 Norwood began\n\nto purchase power instead from New England Power.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f            This opportunity to switch power suppliers was secured\n\nafter Norwood settled an antitrust case against Boston Edison\n\nand New England Power.      See Norwood II, 202 F.3d at 412.           The\n\nsettlement agreement obligated New England Power to furnish, and\n\nNorwood   to    accept,   sufficient    power   to   satisfy     Norwood's\n\nrequirements for electricity through October 31, 1998.                 The\n\npower was to be supplied pursuant to New England Power's FERC\n\nTariff No. 1--the same wholesale tariff under which New England\n\nPower then supplied electricity to its own retail affiliates--\n\n\"as [it] may be amended from time to time.\"           Id.\n\n            The requirements contract provided that its term was\n\nfrom November 1, 1983, to October 31, 1998, but it also stated\n\nthat \"[n]either [New England Power] nor Norwood will give notice\n\nof termination prior to November 1, 1991 and shall not specify\n\na termination date prior to November 1, 1998.\"                 New England\n\nPower's FERC Tariff No. 1, incorporated by reference in its\n\npower   contract   with   Norwood,     said   that   \"[o]nce    initiated,\n\nservice under this tariff shall continue until terminated by\n\neither party giving to the other at least seven years' written\n\nnotice of termination. . . .\"\n\n            Thereafter, the parties twice amended the requirements\n\ncontract.      First, in 1987 the contract was amended to permit\n\nNorwood to take advantage of allocations of lower-cost power\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\ffrom the New York Power Authority.        Second, in 1989 the parties\n\namended the contract to permit Norwood at its election to extend\n\nthe earliest date on which notice of termination could be given\n\nfrom November 1, 1991, to November 1, 2001.\n\n           On July 25, 1990, Norwood sent a letter to New England\n\nPower stating that Norwood \"hereby gives notice . . . that it\n\nextends the date\" for giving notice of termination from November\n\n1, 1991, to November 1, 2001.            The letter continued:       \"The\n\neffect of this is that the Power Contract between [New England\n\nPower]   and    Norwood   would   be   extended   for   [ten]   years   to\n\nmidnight, October 31, 2008 . . . .\"        Whether Norwood did intend\n\nto extend the contract and whether the extension was effective\n\nare principal issues in this case.\n\n           Beginning in December 1996, New England Power made a\n\nset of regulatory filings to restructure itself and to revise\n\nits existing tariff for wholesale power sales.             These filings,\n\ndescribed in detail and upheld in Norwood I, aimed to secure\n\nFERC approval for the sale of New England Power's non-nuclear\n\ngenerating facilities, the release (on payment of termination\n\ncharges)   of    affiliates   from     their   long-term    requirements\n\ncontracts with New England Power, and the restructuring of New\n\nEngland Power's wholesale rates to facilitate customer choice\n\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fand    market-based     pricing     at   both       the    wholesale    and    retail\n\nlevels.    Norwood I, 202 F.3d at 396-97.\n\n           In a set of orders issued between November 1997 and\n\nJune    1998,   FERC    approved      the      sale,      early    termination     by\n\naffiliates on payment of termination charges, the restructuring\n\nof wholesale rates, and a \"rate freeze\" on New England Power's\n\nexisting    charges         with   wholesale        contract      purchasers     like\n\nNorwood.    This freeze was instituted because under the existing\n\ncontracts, rates were normally adjusted to reflect increased\n\ncosts, and New England Power was now divesting itself of its\n\nlow-cost non-nuclear plants.             Norwood II, 202 F.3d at 413.\n\n           Norwood concluded that under the new regime it would\n\nbe disadvantaged vis-à-vis New England Power's retail affiliates\n\nwhom Norwood regards as retail competitors.                   See Norwood II, 202\n\nF.3d at 414.         On March 4, 1998, Norwood notified New England\n\nPower    that   it    was    switching    to    a    new    wholesale    supplier,\n\nNortheast Utilities.           Two weeks later, on March 18, 1998, New\n\nEngland Power filed a revised FERC Tariff No. 1 permitting\n\ndissident wholesale customers like Norwood to terminate their\n\ncontracts early and on only thirty days' notice, conditioned on\n\nthe customers paying a contract termination charge based on an\n\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\favoided cost theory.1        New England Power Co., 83 F.E.R.C. ¶\n\n61,174, reh'g denied, 84 F.E.R.C. ¶ 61,175 (1998).\n\n           To counter New England Power's March 18, 1998, tariff\n\nfiling, Norwood not only objected to the charge before FERC, see\n\nNorwood I, 202 F.3d at 398, but also, in an effort to shorten\n\nthe period of liability, Norwood petitioned FERC in April 1999\n\nfor a declaratory order, 18 C.F.R. § 385.207 (1999), that its\n\ncontract with New England Power had terminated on October 31,\n\n1998, and that New England Power therefore had no basis for\n\nclaiming   any   contract    termination    charges   after   that   date.\n\nNorwood estimates that if fully allowed, the charges will exceed\n\n$7 million per year until 2008.\n\n           FERC dismissed Norwood's petition on the merits on June\n\n21, 1999, Town of Norwood, 87 F.E.R.C. ¶ 61,341 (1999).                In a\n\nnutshell, the Commission found that Norwood had extended the\n\ncontract through October 31, 2008, by its July 25, 1990, letter;\n\nand it concluded that New England Power's failure to file that\n\nletter with FERC was irrelevant.            On August 20, 1999, FERC\n\ndenied   without   opinion    Norwood's    motion   for   rehearing,   and\n\n\n    1The contract termination charge is computed as the revenues\nthat New England Power would have expected to collect had the\ncustomer continued to pay at the now frozen tariff rate through\nthe earliest date that the customer could have unilaterally\nterminated service under the contract, less the expected costs\navoided by New England Power because it did not have to provide\nthe power.\n\n                                  -6-\n\fNorwood    has   sought    review     in   this       court    to    challenge      the\n\nCommission's orders, 16 U.S.C. § 825l(b).\n\n            Norwood's arguments on appeal, which we address in a\n\nsequence    somewhat      different    from       Norwood's         brief,    are    in\n\nsubstance five:      (1) that the requirements contract with New\n\nEngland Power was never extended beyond October 31, 1998; (2)\n\nthat any extension premised on the July 25, 1990, letter is\n\nineffective because the letter was not filed with FERC and\n\nbecause reliance upon it violates the so-called filed rate\n\ndoctrine;   (3) that the FERC order unilaterally altered the\n\ncontract in disregard of the Mobile-Sierra doctrine; (4) that\n\nthe failure to file the letter prevents FERC from relying on it\n\nin   construing    the    contract;        and    (5)       that    FERC    committed\n\nprocedural error.\n\n            Assuming arguendo that the July 25, 1990, letter was\n\nrightly    considered,     it   is    clear      to    us    that    FERC    properly\n\nconstrued the contract to extend Norwood's obligation to take\n\nits requirements from New England Power until October 31, 2008.\n\nThe standard of review need not be considered because, even if\n\nreview of the contract interpretation question were de novo, our\n\nreading would still be precisely that of the Commission.

Norwood's July 25, 1990, letter\n\ntriggered a provision in the 1989 amendment to the original 1983\n\ncontract   and   when   both   the    amendment   and   the   letter   are\n\nconsidered, it is crystal clear that--subject to any other\n\npossible   legal   barrier--Norwood's       obligation     was   extended\n\nthrough October 31, 2008.\n\n           The 1989 amendment explicitly replaced the article of\n\nthe 1983 agreement specifying the term of the contract with a\n\nnew article which specified that the contract continued through\n\nmidnight, October 31, 1998, except:        (1) neither side could give\n\nnotice of termination prior to November 1, 1991, or specify a\n\ntermination date prior to November 1, 1998; and (2):\n\n             Norwood may elect to extend the earliest\n           date by which either party can give notice\n           of intent to terminate service by a total of\n\n\n    2The original contract said that its term was through\nOctober 31, 1998, but FERC Tariff No. 1. said that seven years'\nnotice is required to terminate; while the contract has an\noverrule provision, it is not clear that the two terms are\ninconsistent.\n\n                                     -8-\n\f            [twenty] years in two ten-year increments.\n            In order to exercise this election, Norwood\n            agrees to provide [New England Power] with\n            written notice of each such election at\n            least one year prior to the date that it is\n            to be extended, viz, to November 1, 2001\n            initially   and   to   November   1,   2011\n            ultimately.\n\nCiting this amended article, Norwood on July 25, 1990, wrote New\n\nEngland Power giving notice that it extended the date by which\n\neither side could give notice of an intent to terminate \"to\n\nNovember 1, 2001.     The effect of this is that the Power Contract\n\nbetween [New England Power] and Norwood would be extended for\n\n[ten] years to midnight, October 31, 2008 . . . .\"\n\n            Norwood argues that the letter was an offer that New\n\nEngland Power failed to accept; but the 1989 amendment, which\n\nNorwood explicitly invokes in the 1990 letter, gives Norwood a\n\nunilateral election to extend by written notice, which is just\n\nwhat the 1990 letter comprises.      Norwood also says that the 1990\n\nletter merely extends the earliest date on which the notice of\n\ntermination can be given and does not extend the agreement\n\nitself; but this is just word play in the context of this\n\ncontract.\n\n            Norwood   makes   a   further   contract   interpretation\n\nargument based on the 1987 amendment which was designed to allow\n\nNorwood to reduce its obligation to purchase from New England\n\nPower to the extent that Norwood could obtain a lower-cost\n\n                                  -9-\n\fallocation      from    the    New    York    Power    Authority.       Norwood's\n\nexplanation as to how this 1987 amendment supports its position\n\nis not persuasive enough to merit detailed response.                    The short\n\nanswer is that the 1987 amendment, which had a quite limited\n\nfocus, was followed by a 1989 amendment providing Norwood an\n\nelection   to    extend       the    obligations      through   2008;   and   this\n\nprovision for an election, which Norwood exercised, controls any\n\nprior terms, whether adopted in 1983 or in 1987.\n\n           Norwood's second multi-part argument is that the July\n\n25, 1990, letter was ineffective to extend the contract until\n\n2008   because    the    letter       was    never    filed   with   FERC.     The\n\ngoverning provision of the Federal Power Act provides that\n\nutilities subject to its terms, which includes New England Power\n\nwith respect to wholesale power sales, must file with FERC:\n\n           schedules showing all rates and charges for\n           any transmission or sale subject to the\n           jurisdiction of the Commission, and the\n           classifications, practices, and regulations\n           affecting such rates and charges, together\n           with all contracts which in any manner\n           affect or relate to such rates, charges,\n           classifications, and services.\n\n16 U.S.C. § 824d(c) (1994) (emphasis added).                    The statute also\n\nrequires that any change in a rate or contract must be reflected\n\nin a filing with the Commission which, absent a waiver, must be\n\nmade in advance of the effective date and on sixty days' notice.\n\nId. § 824d(d).\n\n                                        -10-\n\f          Although the statute does not say so explicitly, it\n\nmight be read as saying that an unfiled contract is ineffective;\n\nand in any event, FERC regulations say that a public utility may\n\nnot (to shorten the language to pertinent terms) \"collect . . .\n\nany rate\" or \"impose any . . . contract\" for FERC-regulated\n\nservice   \"which   is   different    from    that    provided    in     a   rate\n\nschedule required to be on file with this Commission unless\n\notherwise specifically provided by order of the Commission for\n\ngood cause shown.\"      18 C.F.R. § 35.1(e) (1999).         \"Rate schedule\"\n\nis defined to include both a statement of rates and charges for\n\nelectric service and \"all classifications, practices, rules,\n\nregulations or contracts which in any manner affect or relate to\n\nthe aforementioned service, rates, and charges.\"                 Id. § 35.2.\n\nThe importance attributed to filings is reinforced by the so-\n\ncalled filed rate doctrine.\n\n          The filed rate doctrine, discussed at greater length\n\nin   Norwood II, 202 F.3d at 416, 418-22, is actually a set of\n\nrules that have evolved over time but revolve around the notion\n\nthat under statutes like the Federal Power Act, utility filings\n\nwith the regulatory agency prevail over unfiled contracts or\n\nother   claims   seeking    different      rates    or   terms   than       those\n\nreflected in the filings with the agency.

Norwood's theory is that the unfiled July 25, 1990,\n\nletter was ineffective because not filed (as required by statute\n\nand regulations) and because giving the unfiled letter effect\n\nwould violate the filed rate doctrine.\n\n            In both variations, Norwood's argument depends on the\n\nproposition    that    the   July   25,    1990,   letter    was    a   contract\n\nrequired to be filed.        The gist of the Commission's holding is\n\nthat the contract was what was set forth in the 1983 contract\n\nand the 1989 amendment, both of which were filed with the\n\nCommission; the letter merely exercised an election already\n\nspelled out in those filings.             The Commission also gave other\n\nalternative reasons for relying on the 1990 letter, which we\n\nwill defer for the present.\n\n            The reference in the statute and regulations to the\n\nfiling   of   \"contracts\"     which      affect    rates    and    services     is\n\nambiguous.     On the one hand, the July 25, 1990, letter is not\n\nitself a contract in common usage; it is the exercise of a\n\nunilateral election by one party under an already existing\n\ncontract.     On the other hand, the election had the effect of\n\nextending the contract term by multiple years, albeit within the\n\nframework of the existing contract.           If the Commission wanted to\n\ncharacterize    such    notices     as    \"contracts,\"      it     would   be    a\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\flinguistic    stretch      but   arguably     within      the   Commission's\n\nauthority to construe its organic statute and regulations.\n\n            However, the Commission has construed the statute and\n\nregulations    not   to    encompass   a   notice    of   election   already\n\nprovided for by a duly filed contract.              This interpretation is\n\nsubject to substantial deference under the Chevron doctrine.3\n\nFurther, in the Towns of Concord and Wellesley v.

But the Supreme Court stressed that it was unclear\n\nwhether FERC would have accepted the higher rate resulting from\n\nthe favored nations clause--by contrast to our case; and FERC\n\nsaid    in   Arkla that its acceptance of the contract did not\n\nconstitute pre-approval of any rate generated by the favored\n\nnations clause.         See Arkla, 453 U.S. at 578-82 & n.11.\n\n             Needless to say, without the filing of the July 25,\n\n1990, letter, no outsider could visit the Commission's files and\n\ndetermine       whether the election to extend had been exercised.\n\nThis provides whatever policy argument there might be for a\n\nbroad interpretation of \"contracts\" in the statute.

And this is the kind of grey area--the determination\n\nof just what the Commission needs to have filed beyond formal\n\ncontracts themselves--in which great weight must be given to the\n\nCommission's judgment.

By the same token\n\nit   is   unnecessary      to   elaborate       on    the   filed    rate   doctrine\n\nbecause giving effect to the notice does not circumvent any\n\nfiling requirement or contradict any extant filing.

That\n\ndoctrine    prohibits       a   regulated        utility      from    unilaterally\n\nchanging    the    fixed    terms    of    a    utilities     contract      absent    a\n\nfinding by FERC that the existing term adversely affects the\n\npublic interest.

However,\n\nthere is no doubt that the letter in this case related to a\n\nfiled contract for the wholesale supply of electric power within\n\nFERC's jurisdiction.\n\n          FERC sometimes declines to address contract issues even\n\nfor sales unquestionably within its jurisdiction,      see, e.g.,\n\nSouthern Cal. Edison Co., 85 F.E.R.C. ¶ 61,023 (1998), but\n\nNorwood makes no claim that FERC is forbidden from interpreting\n\ncontracts filed with FERC or otherwise relevant to FERC tariffs.\n\nHere, the duration of the contract directly affects Norwood's\n\nliability under the March 1998 tariff imposing a termination\n\ncharge; and Norwood itself sought the declaration from FERC as\n\nto whether the contract continued past October 1998.   The letter\n\nwas properly considered as a document pertinent to determining\n\nthe duration of the contract.     Cf. Southern Union Co. v.

After FERC issued its notice of the\n\nfiling of Norwood's petition for a declaratory ruling, FERC\n\ngranted New England Power leave to intervene out of time, and it\n\naccepted      New   England    Power's      answer   to    Norwood's       petition.\n\nNorwood now complains because FERC then denied Norwood's motion\n\nfor   leave    to   file   a   reply,    citing      a    FERC   procedural     rule\n\nprohibiting answers to answers.                 18 C.F.R. § 385.213(a)(2)\n\n(1999).\n\n              Perhaps in some situations it might be improper for an\n\nagency effectively to deny the petitioner the right to respond\n\nto    assertions     raised    for    the    first       time    in   an   answering\n\ndocument, although refusal to allow a formal \"reply\" is not\n\nautomatically the same as precluding evidence or argument.                       The\n\nshort answer in this case is that nothing in Norwood's proffered\n\nreply, which is included in the appendix filed with this court,\n\nalters the result:         in general, the reply sets forth arguments\n\nthat were effectively addressed by FERC in its orders or could\n\nnot affect the outcome in light of dispositive rulings by FERC.\n\n              The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\f</pre>",
