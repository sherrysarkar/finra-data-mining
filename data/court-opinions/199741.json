Héctor M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                     Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n\n                 Kravitch,* Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                     and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Joaquín Monserrate-Matienzo, for appellant.\n     Francis J. Bustamante, Special Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom\nGuillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Jorge E. Vega-Pacheco, Assistant\nU.S. Attorney, Chief, Criminal Division, and Margaret A. Larrea,\nSpecial Assistant U.S. Attorney, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n*   Of the Eleventh Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\fDecember 19, 2001\n\n\n\n\n       -2-\n\f          TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge. Defendant-appellant Norma Burgos-\n\nAndújar appeals her sentence of sixty days' imprisonment after her\n\nconviction for criminal trespass on naval property. Appellant contends\n\nthat the district court erred when it increased her sentence from forty\n\ndays to sixty days. Because we find that the district court increased\n\nappellant's sentence in response to her continuing allocution, we\n\naffirm.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          On April 28, 2001, officers of the United States Navy\n\narrested appellant on a small island off the coast of Vieques, Puerto\n\nRico for trespassing in Navy territory. On July 6, 2001, after a bench\n\ntrial, appellant was convicted of criminal trespass in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1382. After finding the appellant guilty, the district court\n\ngave appellant and her co-defendants an opportunity to address the\n\ncourt. Thereafter, appellant made a statement.1       After appellant\n\nconcluded her statement, the court said, \"Just keep in mind that you\n\nare a lawmaker, not a lawbreaker. I'll hear the next one.\" To which\n\nappellant replied, \"And you have to bring us justice.\" After a short\n\nrecess, the court announced sentences for all the defendants, including\n\nappellant.\n\n\n\n\n1 Appellant submitted a written statement, in Spanish, which was\ntranslated and presented to the court.\n\n                                 -3-\n\f          When announcing appellant's sentence, the court began by\n\nexplaining its rationale for the sentence. This statement focused\n\nlargely on appellant's position as a legislator in the Puerto Rican\n\nSenate and her involvement in the movement to stop military exercises\n\non Vieques through civil disobedience.       At one point, the court\n\nincluded a reference to unknown \"masked men\" who had previously entered\n\nCamp Garcia but who were not related to the current proceedings.\n\nShortly thereafter, as the court was still discussing its rationale for\n\nappellant's sentence but before pronouncing any sentence, appellant\n\nattempted to respond to the court's comments. This is evident because\n\nthe record reflects the court interrupting its statements to say, \"I'll\n\ngive you a chance.\" After finishing its comments, the court proceeded\n\nas follows:\n\n                 With that in mind, I am sentencing you as\n          follows:\n                 It is the judgment of this Court that\n          Defendant, Norma Burgos, is hereby sentenced and\n          hereby ordered committed today to a term of 40\n          days [and] a special monetary assessment in the\n          amount of $10 is imposed. . . . That will be all.\n\n          After this pronouncement, appellant interjected, \"You said\n\n--.\" To which the court, once again, said, \"That's all.\" At this\n\npoint, appellant again spoke, saying, \"You said you were going to allow\n\nme to speak,\" apparently referring to the point in the prior statement\n\nwhen the court said, before imposing sentence on appellant, \"I'll give\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fyou a chance.\" The court then allowed appellant to speak, cautioning\n\nher to keep it brief.\n\n          Appellant then said:\n\n                  I do recognize what your function is. As\n          a Judge of the U.S. District Court here in Puerto\n          Rico, you have to interpret and provide justice.\n          But what justice are you imparting when you are\n          presuming that at this point in time when you're\n          passing sentence upon me the people who were\n          hooded there were not people who were working for\n          the Navy and following the orders of Navy\n          personnel?\n                  When did they come before you in this\n          court? What was the evidence presented before\n          you to demonstrate that they were guilty as when\n          they were working for the cause of Vieques?\n                  You said that you expect that the same way\n          that I imagine that your people will seek peace\n          and they will work and have respect for the\n          Constitution that they uphold. That's correct?\n                  But then before this court more than 700\n          people to this day have come and passed before\n          this court to be judged by all of you, you as the\n          judges, with evidence that demonstrates that the\n          ones who are violating the greater law are the\n          members of the Navy. What are you waiting for in\n          order to come and arrest them and judge them?\n\nThe court then warned the appellant to be careful, telling her, \"You\n\nare becoming defiant. I think it would behoove you to calm down and\n\nthink about what you are going to say. It does not behoove you to defy\n\nthe court.\" From this point forward, the record contains only the\n\nstatements of the court and appellant's lawyer. Appellant apparently\n\ncontinued in Spanish, and her comments are not recorded.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f          The record does reflect the court's attempts to stop\n\nappellant's continuing speech with periodic interruptions that read,\n\n\"That will be all. . . .Miss Burgos, that's it. Will you please -- .\"\n\nAt the apparent end of appellant's statement, the court stated, \"Okay.\n\nI'll change that sentence to 60 days.\" The court then had appellant\n\nescorted from the courtroom. Appellant's attorney immediately asked\n\nfor a reconsideration which the court refused.\n\n          Appellant then sought to be released on bail during her\n\ncurrent appeal.   The court denied her motion saying, \"The longer\n\nsentence that the Court imposed on Defendant was not based on a finding\n\nof contempt. The Court simply exercised its discretion under 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1382 to impose a sentence of not more than six months' imprisonment.\n\nNo contempt proceedings were necessary.\"\n\n          Appellant then filed an appeal and motion for bail on appeal\n\nwith this Court on July 23, 2001. We granted the motion for bail on\n\nappeal on August 10, 2001.\n\n                                 II.\n\n          Appellant was convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1382 which forbids\n\nunlawful entry onto naval property, inter alia. This section also\n\nauthorizes imprisonment of offenders for terms of up to six months.\n\nSee id. Appellant received a sentence of only sixty days, well below\n\nthe statutory limit. Because convictions under section 1382 are Class\n\nB misdemeanors, see 18 U.S.C. § 3559(a)(7), and not subject to the\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fSentencing Guidelines, see U.S.S.G. § 1B1.9, we generally review\n\nsentences under section 1382 to determine if they are \"plainly\n\nunreasonable.\" 18 U.S.C. §§ 3742(e)(4); see also United States v.\n\nSharpton, 252 F.3d 536, 540 (1st Cir. 2001) (per curiam). There is no\n\nsuggestion here that had the district court simply sentenced appellant\n\nto sixty days that such a sentence would have been plainly\n\nunreasonable.2 Therefore, as a threshold matter, we find no error as\n\nto the length of appellant's sentence.\n\n          Appellant's central contention, however, is that the district\n\ncourt erred when it altered her sentence from forty days to sixty days.\n\nGenerally, a sentencing court has broad discretion, and we review\n\nsentencing determinations only for abuse of discretion. See United\n\nStates v. Jiménez-Rivera, 842 F.2d 545, 548 (1st Cir. 1988). However,\n\nthe sentencing court does have to comply with certain procedural rules,\n\nand we review compliance with those procedural rules de novo. See\n\nUnited States v. Encarnación, 239 F.3d 395, 398 (1st Cir. 2001); see\n\nalso United States v. Myers, 150 F.3d 459, 461 (5th Cir. 1998).\n\n          As a basic rule, the sentencing court must \"determine whether\n\nthe defendant wishes to make a statement and to present any information\n\n\n2 Appellant essentially concedes this point. In her brief to this\ncourt, appellant claims that the forty-day sentence was \"inaccurate\"\nand \"disproportionate\" because it exceeded the sentences of her co-\ndefendants by ten days. However, appellant acknowledges that this\nsentence was legal. We see no reason why we should treat the forty-day\nand sixty-day sentences differently for the purposes of determining\nwhether they are plainly unreasonable.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fin mitigation of sentence.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(c)(3)(C) (emphasis\n\nadded). This is not merely a technical rule, but reflects our long\n\ntradition of giving all defendants the right to directly address the\n\ncourt and plead for mercy. See Green v. United States, 365 U.S. 301,\n\n304 (1961); see also United States v. de Alba Pagán, 33 F.3d 125, 129\n\n(1st Cir. 1994) (\"It is designed to temper punishment with mercy in\n\nappropriate    cases,   and   to   ensure   that   sentencing   reflects\n\nindividualized circumstances.\"); see also Myers, 150 F.3d at 463\n\n(stating that a remand is needed when a judge’s comments indicate that\n\nhe would be unmoved by anything the defendant might say during the\n\nallocution).    In keeping with the importance of this rule, if a\n\nsentencing court fails to provide a defendant with the chance to\n\naddress the court, the reviewing court must remand the case for\n\nresentencing, generally without needing to inquire into prejudice. See\n\nde Alba Pagán, 33 F.3d at 130.\n\n          To satisfy the requirements of Rule 32(c)(3)(C), we encourage\n\nthe sentencing court to address the defendant personally, see Green,\n\n365 U.S. at 304, and allow the defendant to speak on all topics which\n\nthe defendant considers relevant. See de Alba Pagán, 33 F.3d at 129.\n\nThe sentencing judge must be explicit when informing the defendant of\n\nher right to allocute. See United States v. Edgecomb, 910 F.2d 1309,\n\n1315 (6th Cir. 1990) (holding it insufficient when the sentencing judge\n\nonly questioned defendant on certain aspects of the presentence\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\freport); see also United States v. Navarro-Flores, 628 F.2d 1178, 1184\n\n(9th Cir. 1980) (remanding for resentencing because the judge did not\n\naddress the defendant personally); United States v. Murphy, 530 F.2d\n\n1 (4th Cir. 1976) (remanding for resentencing when the sentencing judge\n\nengaged the defendant on a specific issue and then asked twice if there\n\nwas anything \"you\" want to add, to which the defense counsel and then\n\nthe prosecutor responded but never the defendant). Similarly, the\n\nsentencing court must be clear in informing the defendant of her right\n\nto speak broadly:\n\n          . . . the court, the prosecutor, and the\n          defendant must at the very least interact in a\n          manner that shows clearly and convincingly that\n          the defendant knew he had the right to speak on\n          any subject of his choosing prior to the\n          imposition of his sentence.\n\nde Alba Pagán, 33 F.3d at 129 (emphasis added).\n\n          There is no question here that the sentencing judge complied\n\nwith the requirements of Rule 32(c)(3)(C).         Appellant made an\n\nallocution before the judge began announcing the sentence. The issue\n\nbefore us, however, is how to consider appellant's second statement to\n\nthe court.   On the facts before us, in which the sentencing judge\n\nindicated, prior to the imposition of sentence, that appellant would be\n\ngiven an opportunity to respond, we hold that it was a continuation of\n\nthe allocution.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f          The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure do not accord a\n\ndefendant the right to a second allocution. In fact, the rules do not\n\neven require a sentencing court to remind a defendant of the right to\n\nallocute so long as the court clearly notifies the defendant once. See\n\nUnited States v. Franklin, 902 F.2d 501, 506-07 (7th Cir. 1990)\n\n(holding right to allocution not denied when judge addressed defendant\n\nby name and asked him if he had anything to say but did not renew that\n\ninvitation after defense counsel finished speaking). However, the fact\n\nthat there is no right to a second allocution does not mean that a\n\nsentencing court may not grant a defendant a second opportunity to\n\naddress the court.\n\n          Here, appellant interrupted the sentencing, expressing a\n\ndesire to speak again.    Before the judge actually pronounced any\n\nsentence, he acknowledged appellant's wish to speak and promised to\n\ngive her time to so respond.      The judge did not need to grant\n\nappellant's request, but he did.3 Appellant then proceeded to make her\n\nstatement, which was clearly intended to influence the length of her\n\nsentence. She spoke about how it was unfair for the judge to conflate\n\n\n\n\n3 Considering the importance of the right to allocute discussed above,\nthe judge may have erred on the side of caution in granting appellant's\nrequest to speak again. He simply gave appellant the opportunity to\ndiscuss all matters she thought needed to be addressed in relation to\nher sentence. It is an example of a sentence judge applying Rule\n32(c)(3)(C) \"liberally.\" United States v. Barnes, 948 F.2d 325, 328\n(7th Cir. 1991).\n\n                                 -10-\n\fher with the masked men because they had never been tried and their\n\nidentities never established.      She said, specifically:\n\n          But what justice are you imparting when you are\n          presuming that at this point in time when you're\n          passing sentence upon me the people who were\n          hooded there were not people who were working for\n          the Navy and following the orders of Navy\n          personnel? When did they come before you in this\n          court?\n\nNot only was appellant making a plea to the judge to mitigate her\n\nsentence. She was also engaging the judge with specific references to\n\nthe judge's own concerns. This fits the purpose of the allocution\n\nright which \"envisions a personal colloquy between the sentencing judge\n\nand the defendant.\"    Myers, 150 F.3d at 461 (emphasis in original).\n\n          Unfortunately for appellant, her statement did not have the\n\nintended effect of lowering her sentence. Rather, the judge increased\n\nher sentence. There are several reasons why the judge may have done\n\nthis, all permissible within his discretion in sentencing. First,\n\nappellant essentially declared herself innocent of crime and thus was\n\nrefusing to acknowledge the impact of her illegal action. Second, in\n\nher comments, she disparaged the validity of the law she broke,\n\naccusing the United States Navy of breaking the \"greater law.\" Her\n\nstatements certainly suggest a lack of remorse, an attempt to avoid\n\nresponsibility for her actions, and even a likelihood of repeating her\n\nillegal actions. Any of these reasons may have legitimately led the\n\nsentencing judge to increase appellant's sentence.\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\f          The question then becomes whether the sentencing judge\n\nproperly considered appellant's statements when he increased her\n\nsentence.4 Rule 35(c)(3)(C) requires a judge to always consider a\n\ndefendant's allocution when imposing sentence, even if the judge had\n\npreviously announced a tentative sentence before the exercise of\n\ndefendant's right of allocution. See United States v. Mata-Grullon,\n\n887 F.2d 23 (1st Cir. 1989) (per curiam); see also United States v.\n\nMargiotti, 85 F.3d 100 (2d Cir. 1996); United States v. Wolfe, 71 F.3d\n\n611, 614-15 (6th Cir. 1995); United States v. Laverne, 963 F.2d 235\n\n(9th Cir. 1992). When a judge announces a sentence before hearing an\n\nallocution, it is fair to assume that such a sentence is tentative and\n\nthat the judge will consider the defendant's statements before imposing\n\na final sentence.    See Mata-Grullon, 887 F.2d at 25; see, e.g.,\n\nMargiotti, 85 F.3d at 104 (holding that in case where the sentencing\n\njudge forgot to give defendant opportunity to speak before announcing\n\na sentence but then promptly rectified the error by allowing defendant\n\nto speak, the sentence was not imposed until after defendant\n\nallocuted); Laverne, 963 F.2d 235 (holding the right to allocute was\n\nnot violated when court announced a tentative sentence and then allowed\n\ndefendant a right of allocution).\n\n4 At oral argument, appellant's counsel argued that the sentencing\njudge could have considered appellant's statement only for the purposes\nof lowering her sentence. There is no support for such a proposition.\nIf the judge had the authority to adjust appellant's sentence downward,\nhe had the authority to adjust it upward.\n\n                                 -12-\n\f          Here, the sentencing judge granted appellant the right to\n\nspeak before he sentenced her. While so engaged, appellant interrupted\n\nthe sentencing for the purpose of refuting the judge's commentary and,\n\nobviously, for the purpose of influencing his pronouncement. Before\n\ncontinuing her sentencing, the judge indicated he would grant appellant\n\nthe opportunity to be heard again. After imposing the forty days'\n\nsentence, the judge then allowed appellant to continue her allocution.\n\nThe sentencing judge was fully justified in considering her full\n\nallocution, which included her comments during the second part of her\n\nallocution. Because of the way the hearing developed, the forty-day\n\nsentence was functionally a tentative sentence. See Mata-Grullon, 887\n\nF.2d at 25; see also Laverne, 963 F.2d 235.      Thus, the sixty-day\n\nsentence was properly imposed in response to appellant's full\n\nallocution.\n\n                                 III.\n\n          Notwithstanding the sentencing court's discretion to alter\n\nher sentence in response to her continuing allocution, appellant claims\n\nthat her sentence is invalid for two reasons.\n\n                                  A.\n\n          First, appellant asserts that the district court imposed an\n\nadditional twenty days because of its perceived \"defiance\" of the\n\nappellant and that such a penalty is a punishment for criminal\n\ncontempt. She also contends that the district court failed to comply\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fwith the strict procedural requirements for punishing criminal\n\ncontempt. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 42(a) (requiring the court to certify\n\nthat it witnessed the contemptuous conduct and enter an order reciting\n\nthe facts). We agree with appellant's contention that the district\n\ncourt did not comply with the requirements for criminal contempt under\n\nRule 42(a), but we disagree that the disputed twenty day increase is a\n\ncriminal contempt sanction.\n\n          Appellant points to two facts in support of her argument that\n\nthe additional twenty days' imprisonment is a criminal contempt\n\nsanction: (1) the district court said that the appellant was becoming\n\n\"defiant\" before announcing the sixty-day sentence and (2) the district\n\ncourt had already announced a sentence of forty days' imprisonment.\n\n          We have held that it is necessary to look to the \"purpose and\n\ncharacter of the sanctions imposed\" and not to the name used by the\n\ndistrict court when evaluating whether a particular sanction is for\n\ncriminal contempt. In re Kave, 760 F.2d 343, 351 (1st Cir. 1985); see\n\nalso United States v. Winter, 70 F.3d 655, 660 (1st Cir. 1995) (holding\n\nthat the characterization of a contempt sanction is a question of law\n\nand is not binding on this Court). While these cases deal with the\n\ndistinction between civil and criminal contempt, the label affixed by\n\na district court need not be controlling regardless of whether the\n\ndistrict court called it contempt in the first place. Hicks v. Feiock,\n\n485 U.S. 624, 629 (1988). Here, the sentencing court was explicit that\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\fthere was no contempt finding at all. When it considered appellant's\n\nmotion for bail on appeal, the court said, \"The longer sentence that\n\nthe Court imposed on Defendant was not based on a finding of contempt.\"\n\nHowever, neither of the facts cited by appellant persuades us to\n\noverlook the district court's overt statement that there was no\n\ncontempt finding here. As discussed above, the sentencing court raised\n\nappellant's sentence in response to her continuing allocution.\n\n            Even if appellant's behavior at sentencing had risen to the\n\nlevel of clear contempt,5 the sentencing court maintains flexibility in\n\nhow to deal with such conduct. See United States v. Pina, 844 F.2d 1,\n\n14 (1st Cir. 1988) (\"The contempt power, however, is not the only\n\nweapon available to a judge to protect the order and dignity of the\n\ncourtroom in the face of an openly contumacious defendant.\"). One\n\nalternate tool is to remove the contemptuous party from the courtroom,\n\nsee id. at 14-15, as the judge did here.      The fact that the judge\n\nadopted alternate means to deal with a \"defiant\" defendant suggests\n\neven more strongly that the increased sentence was not a contempt\n\nsanction.\n\n\n5 The district court warned appellant that she was becoming \"defiant\"\npart way through her second statement. Appellant then continued to\nspeak, in Spanish. While we do not have a record of appellant's\nSpanish statements, we assume that had appellant's Spanish statements\nrisen to the level of criminal contempt, the district court would have\nstopped appellant, had her comments translated for the record, and made\na contempt finding. In the absence of such action by the district\ncourt, we assume that appellant said nothing which rose to the level of\ncriminal contempt.\n\n                                  -15-\n\f                                   B.\n\n            Second, appellant argues that the district court did not make\n\na clerical, technical, or other clear mistake when imposing the\n\noriginal forty-day sentence, so it lacked authority to later alter that\n\nsentence. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(c) (\"The court, acting within 7 days\n\nafter the imposition of sentence, may correct a sentence that was\n\nimposed as a result of arithmetical, technical, or other clear\n\nerror.\").    Rule 35(c) is a very narrow rule:\n\n            The authority to correct a sentence under this\n            subdivision is intended to be very narrow and to\n            extend only to those cases in which an obvious\n            error or mistake has occurred in the sentence,\n            that is, errors which would almost certainly\n            result in a remand of the case to the trial court\n            for further action under Rule 35(a).          The\n            subdivision is not intended to afford the court\n            the opportunity . . . simply to change its mind\n            about the appropriateness of the sentence.\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 35(c) advisory committee's note; see also United\n\nStates v. Aqua-Leisure Indus., Inc., 150 F.3d 95, 96 (1st Cir. 1998)\n\n(noting that Rule 35 was amended to restrict the discretion of the\n\ndistrict court in altering a lawfully imposed sentence). We agree with\n\nappellant that the original sentence did not suffer from any error\n\n\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\fallowing alteration under Rule 35(c).6 However, we also find that the\n\nsentencing court did not alter her sentence under Rule 35(c).\n\n                                 IV.\n\n          Appellant's sentence is valid because it was imposed after\n\nappellant's full allocution before final sentencing. Therefore, we\n\naffirm the sixty-day sentence.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n6 Because we hold that there was no alteration under Rule 35(c), we\nfind it unnecessary to address the complicated question of exactly when\na sentence is imposed for purposes of Rule 35(c). Currently, there is\na circuit split on this issue. Many circuits look to the oral\nimposition of sentence. Compare United States v. Aguirre, 214 F.3d\n1122, 1125 (9th Cir. 2000) (holding that oral imposition of sentence\nbegins seven day clock for Rule 35(c)); see also United States v.\nMorrison, 204 F.3d 1091, 1094 (11th Cir. 2000) (same); United States v.\nGonzález, 163 F.3d 255, 263-64 (5th Cir. 1998) (same); United States v.\nAbreu-Cabrera, 64 F.3d 67, 73-74 (2d Cir. 1995) (same); United States\nv. Layman, 116 F.3d 105, 108-09 (4th Cir. 1994) (same); United States\nv. Townsend, 33 F.3d 67, 73 (10th Cir. 1994) (same); with United States\nv. Clay, 37 F.3d 338, 340 (7th Cir. 1994) (holding that a sentence is\nnot imposed until judgment enters, for purposes of Rule 35(c)). This\ncircuit has not decided this issue, but we have suggested that we will\nlook to the date judgment enters, not oral pronouncement. See United\nStates v. Morillo, 8 F.3d 864, 869 n.8 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n                                 -17-\n\f",

Defendant-appellant Norma Burgos-\n\nAndújar appeals her sentence of sixty days' imprisonment after her\n\nconviction for criminal trespass on naval property. Appellant contends\n\nthat the district court erred when it increased her sentence from forty\n\ndays to sixty days. Because we find that the district court increased\n\nappellant's sentence in response to her continuing allocution, we\n\naffirm.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          On April 28, 2001, officers of the United States Navy\n\narrested appellant on a small island off the coast of Vieques, Puerto\n\nRico for trespassing in Navy territory. On July 6, 2001, after a bench\n\ntrial, appellant was convicted of criminal trespass in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1382. After finding the appellant guilty, the district court\n\ngave appellant and her co-defendants an opportunity to address the\n\ncourt. Thereafter, appellant made a statement.1       After appellant\n\nconcluded her statement, the court said, \"Just keep in mind that you\n\nare a lawmaker, not a lawbreaker. I'll hear the next one.\" To which\n\nappellant replied, \"And you have to bring us justice.\" After a short\n\nrecess, the court announced sentences for all the defendants, including\n\nappellant.\n\n\n\n\n1 Appellant submitted a written statement, in Spanish, which was\ntranslated and presented to the court.\n\n                                 -3-\n\f          When announcing appellant's sentence, the court began by\n\nexplaining its rationale for the sentence. This statement focused\n\nlargely on appellant's position as a legislator in the Puerto Rican\n\nSenate and her involvement in the movement to stop military exercises\n\non Vieques through civil disobedience.       At one point, the court\n\nincluded a reference to unknown \"masked men\" who had previously entered\n\nCamp Garcia but who were not related to the current proceedings.\n\nShortly thereafter, as the court was still discussing its rationale for\n\nappellant's sentence but before pronouncing any sentence, appellant\n\nattempted to respond to the court's comments. This is evident because\n\nthe record reflects the court interrupting its statements to say, \"I'll\n\ngive you a chance.\" After finishing its comments, the court proceeded\n\nas follows:\n\n                 With that in mind, I am sentencing you as\n          follows:\n                 It is the judgment of this Court that\n          Defendant, Norma Burgos, is hereby sentenced and\n          hereby ordered committed today to a term of 40\n          days [and] a special monetary assessment in the\n          amount of $10 is imposed. . . . That will be all.\n\n          After this pronouncement, appellant interjected, \"You said\n\n--.\" To which the court, once again, said, \"That's all.\" At this\n\npoint, appellant again spoke, saying, \"You said you were going to allow\n\nme to speak,\" apparently referring to the point in the prior statement\n\nwhen the court said, before imposing sentence on appellant, \"I'll give\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fyou a chance.\" The court then allowed appellant to speak, cautioning\n\nher to keep it brief.\n\n          Appellant then said:\n\n                  I do recognize what your function is. As\n          a Judge of the U.S. District Court here in Puerto\n          Rico, you have to interpret and provide justice.\n          But what justice are you imparting when you are\n          presuming that at this point in time when you're\n          passing sentence upon me the people who were\n          hooded there were not people who were working for\n          the Navy and following the orders of Navy\n          personnel?\n                  When did they come before you in this\n          court? What was the evidence presented before\n          you to demonstrate that they were guilty as when\n          they were working for the cause of Vieques?\n                  You said that you expect that the same way\n          that I imagine that your people will seek peace\n          and they will work and have respect for the\n          Constitution that they uphold. That's correct?\n                  But then before this court more than 700\n          people to this day have come and passed before\n          this court to be judged by all of you, you as the\n          judges, with evidence that demonstrates that the\n          ones who are violating the greater law are the\n          members of the Navy. What are you waiting for in\n          order to come and arrest them and judge them?\n\nThe court then warned the appellant to be careful, telling her, \"You\n\nare becoming defiant. I think it would behoove you to calm down and\n\nthink about what you are going to say. It does not behoove you to defy\n\nthe court.\" From this point forward, the record contains only the\n\nstatements of the court and appellant's lawyer. Appellant apparently\n\ncontinued in Spanish, and her comments are not recorded.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f          The record does reflect the court's attempts to stop\n\nappellant's continuing speech with periodic interruptions that read,\n\n\"That will be all. . . .Miss Burgos, that's it. Will you please -- .\"\n\nAt the apparent end of appellant's statement, the court stated, \"Okay.\n\nI'll change that sentence to 60 days.\" The court then had appellant\n\nescorted from the courtroom. Appellant's attorney immediately asked\n\nfor a reconsideration which the court refused.\n\n          Appellant then sought to be released on bail during her\n\ncurrent appeal.   The court denied her motion saying, \"The longer\n\nsentence that the Court imposed on Defendant was not based on a finding\n\nof contempt. The Court simply exercised its discretion under 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1382 to impose a sentence of not more than six months' imprisonment.\n\nNo contempt proceedings were necessary.\"\n\n          Appellant then filed an appeal and motion for bail on appeal\n\nwith this Court on July 23, 2001. We granted the motion for bail on\n\nappeal on August 10, 2001.\n\n                                 II.\n\n          Appellant was convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1382 which forbids\n\nunlawful entry onto naval property, inter alia. This section also\n\nauthorizes imprisonment of offenders for terms of up to six months.\n\nSee id. Appellant received a sentence of only sixty days, well below\n\nthe statutory limit. Because convictions under section 1382 are Class\n\nB misdemeanors, see 18 U.S.C. § 3559(a)(7), and not subject to the\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fSentencing Guidelines, see U.S.S.G. § 1B1.9, we generally review\n\nsentences under section 1382 to determine if they are \"plainly\n\nunreasonable.\" 18 U.S.C. §§ 3742(e)(4); see also United States v.\n\nSharpton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199452\"><a href=\"/opinion/199452/united-states-v-sharpton/\"><span class=\"volume\">252</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">536</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 540 (1st Cir. 2001) (per curiam). There is no\n\nsuggestion here that had the district court simply sentenced appellant\n\nto sixty days that such a sentence would have been plainly\n\nunreasonable.2 Therefore, as a threshold matter, we find no error as\n\nto the length of appellant's sentence.\n\n          Appellant's central contention, however, is that the district\n\ncourt erred when it altered her sentence from forty days to sixty days.\n\nGenerally, a sentencing court has broad discretion, and we review\n\nsentencing determinations only for abuse of discretion.

Jiménez-Rivera, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"503431\"><a href=\"/opinion/503431/united-states-v-armando-jimenez-rivera-united-states-of-america-v-jose/\"><span class=\"volume\">842</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">545</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 548 (1st Cir. 1988).

In her brief to this\ncourt, appellant claims that the forty-day sentence was \"inaccurate\"\nand \"disproportionate\" because it exceeded the sentences of her co-\ndefendants by ten days. However, appellant acknowledges that this\nsentence was legal. We see no reason why we should treat the forty-day\nand sixty-day sentences differently for the purposes of determining\nwhether they are plainly unreasonable.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fin mitigation of sentence.\" Fed.

In keeping with the importance of this rule, if a\n\nsentencing court fails to provide a defendant with the chance to\n\naddress the court, the reviewing court must remand the case for\n\nresentencing, generally without needing to inquire into prejudice. See\n\nde Alba Pagán, 33 F.3d at 130.\n\n          To satisfy the requirements of Rule 32(c)(3)(C), we encourage\n\nthe sentencing court to address the defendant personally, see Green,\n\n365 U.S. at 304, and allow the defendant to speak on all topics which\n\nthe defendant considers relevant.

Similarly, the\n\nsentencing court must be clear in informing the defendant of her right\n\nto speak broadly:\n\n          . . . the court, the prosecutor, and the\n          defendant must at the very least interact in a\n          manner that shows clearly and convincingly that\n          the defendant knew he had the right to speak on\n          any subject of his choosing prior to the\n          imposition of his sentence.\n\nde Alba Pagán, 33 F.3d at 129 (emphasis added).\n\n          There is no question here that the sentencing judge complied\n\nwith the requirements of Rule 32(c)(3)(C).         Appellant made an\n\nallocution before the judge began announcing the sentence. The issue\n\nbefore us, however, is how to consider appellant's second statement to\n\nthe court.   On the facts before us, in which the sentencing judge\n\nindicated, prior to the imposition of sentence, that appellant would be\n\ngiven an opportunity to respond, we hold that it was a continuation of\n\nthe allocution.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f          The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure do not accord a\n\ndefendant the right to a second allocution. In fact, the rules do not\n\neven require a sentencing court to remind a defendant of the right to\n\nallocute so long as the court clearly notifies the defendant once. See\n\nUnited States v. Franklin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540848\"><a href=\"/opinion/540848/united-states-v-willie-lee-franklin-jerome-mann-willie-r-anderson-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">501</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 506-07 (7th Cir. 1990)\n\n(holding right to allocution not denied when judge addressed defendant\n\nby name and asked him if he had anything to say but did not renew that\n\ninvitation after defense counsel finished speaking). However, the fact\n\nthat there is no right to a second allocution does not mean that a\n\nsentencing court may not grant a defendant a second opportunity to\n\naddress the court.\n\n          Here, appellant interrupted the sentencing, expressing a\n\ndesire to speak again.    Before the judge actually pronounced any\n\nsentence, he acknowledged appellant's wish to speak and promised to\n\ngive her time to so respond.      The judge did not need to grant\n\nappellant's request, but he did.3 Appellant then proceeded to make her\n\nstatement, which was clearly intended to influence the length of her\n\nsentence. She spoke about how it was unfair for the judge to conflate\n\n\n\n\n3 Considering the importance of the right to allocute discussed above,\nthe judge may have erred on the side of caution in granting appellant's\nrequest to speak again. He simply gave appellant the opportunity to\ndiscuss all matters she thought needed to be addressed in relation to\nher sentence. It is an example of a sentence judge applying Rule\n32(c)(3)(C) \"liberally.\" United States v. Barnes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"571297\"><a href=\"/opinion/571297/united-states-v-walter-barnes/\"><span class=\"volume\">948</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 328\n(7th Cir. 1991).\n\n                                 -10-\n\fher with the masked men because they had never been tried and their\n\nidentities never established.

When did they come before you in this\n          court?\n\nNot only was appellant making a plea to the judge to mitigate her\n\nsentence. She was also engaging the judge with specific references to\n\nthe judge's own concerns. This fits the purpose of the allocution\n\nright which \"envisions a personal colloquy between the sentencing judge\n\nand the defendant.\"    Myers, 150 F.3d at 461 (emphasis in original).\n\n          Unfortunately for appellant, her statement did not have the\n\nintended effect of lowering her sentence. Rather, the judge increased\n\nher sentence. There are several reasons why the judge may have done\n\nthis, all permissible within his discretion in sentencing. First,\n\nappellant essentially declared herself innocent of crime and thus was\n\nrefusing to acknowledge the impact of her illegal action. Second, in\n\nher comments, she disparaged the validity of the law she broke,\n\naccusing the United States Navy of breaking the \"greater law.\" Her\n\nstatements certainly suggest a lack of remorse, an attempt to avoid\n\nresponsibility for her actions, and even a likelihood of repeating her\n\nillegal actions. Any of these reasons may have legitimately led the\n\nsentencing judge to increase appellant's sentence.\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\f          The question then becomes whether the sentencing judge\n\nproperly considered appellant's statements when he increased her\n\nsentence.4 Rule 35(c)(3)(C) requires a judge to always consider a\n\ndefendant's allocution when imposing sentence, even if the judge had\n\npreviously announced a tentative sentence before the exercise of\n\ndefendant's right of allocution.

When a judge announces a sentence before hearing an\n\nallocution, it is fair to assume that such a sentence is tentative and\n\nthat the judge will consider the defendant's statements before imposing\n\na final sentence.    See Mata-Grullon, 887 F.2d at 25; see, e.g.,\n\nMargiotti, 85 F.3d at 104 (holding that in case where the sentencing\n\njudge forgot to give defendant opportunity to speak before announcing\n\na sentence but then promptly rectified the error by allowing defendant\n\nto speak, the sentence was not imposed until after defendant\n\nallocuted); Laverne, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"582814\"><a href=\"/opinion/582814/united-states-v-jerry-joseph-laverne/\"><span class=\"volume\">963</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">235</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (holding the right to allocute was\n\nnot violated when court announced a tentative sentence and then allowed\n\ndefendant a right of allocution).\n\n4 At oral argument, appellant's counsel argued that the sentencing\njudge could have considered appellant's statement only for the purposes\nof lowering her sentence. There is no support for such a proposition.\nIf the judge had the authority to adjust appellant's sentence downward,\nhe had the authority to adjust it upward.\n\n                                 -12-\n\f          Here, the sentencing judge granted appellant the right to\n\nspeak before he sentenced her. While so engaged, appellant interrupted\n\nthe sentencing for the purpose of refuting the judge's commentary and,\n\nobviously, for the purpose of influencing his pronouncement. Before\n\ncontinuing her sentencing, the judge indicated he would grant appellant\n\nthe opportunity to be heard again. After imposing the forty days'\n\nsentence, the judge then allowed appellant to continue her allocution.\n\nThe sentencing judge was fully justified in considering her full\n\nallocution, which included her comments during the second part of her\n\nallocution. Because of the way the hearing developed, the forty-day\n\nsentence was functionally a tentative sentence. See Mata-Grullon, 887\n\nF.2d at 25; see also Laverne, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"582814\"><a href=\"/opinion/582814/united-states-v-jerry-joseph-laverne/\"><span class=\"volume\">963</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">235</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.      Thus, the sixty-day\n\nsentence was properly imposed in response to appellant's full\n\nallocution.\n\n                                 III.\n\n          Notwithstanding the sentencing court's discretion to alter\n\nher sentence in response to her continuing allocution, appellant claims\n\nthat her sentence is invalid for two reasons.\n\n                                  A.\n\n          First, appellant asserts that the district court imposed an\n\nadditional twenty days because of its perceived \"defiance\" of the\n\nappellant and that such a penalty is a punishment for criminal\n\ncontempt. She also contends that the district court failed to comply\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fwith the strict procedural requirements for punishing criminal\n\ncontempt. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 42(a) (requiring the court to certify\n\nthat it witnessed the contemptuous conduct and enter an order reciting\n\nthe facts). We agree with appellant's contention that the district\n\ncourt did not comply with the requirements for criminal contempt under\n\nRule 42(a), but we disagree that the disputed twenty day increase is a\n\ncriminal contempt sanction.\n\n          Appellant points to two facts in support of her argument that\n\nthe additional twenty days' imprisonment is a criminal contempt\n\nsanction: (1) the district court said that the appellant was becoming\n\n\"defiant\" before announcing the sixty-day sentence and (2) the district\n\ncourt had already announced a sentence of forty days' imprisonment.\n\n          We have held that it is necessary to look to the \"purpose and\n\ncharacter of the sanctions imposed\" and not to the name used by the\n\ndistrict court when evaluating whether a particular sanction is for\n\ncriminal contempt.

While these cases deal with the\n\ndistinction between civil and criminal contempt, the label affixed by\n\na district court need not be controlling regardless of whether the\n\ndistrict court called it contempt in the first place. Hicks v. Feiock,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112045\"><a href=\"/opinion/112045/hicks-v-feiock/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 629 (1988). Here, the sentencing court was explicit that\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\fthere was no contempt finding at all. When it considered appellant's\n\nmotion for bail on appeal, the court said, \"The longer sentence that\n\nthe Court imposed on Defendant was not based on a finding of contempt.\"\n\nHowever, neither of the facts cited by appellant persuades us to\n\noverlook the district court's overt statement that there was no\n\ncontempt finding here. As discussed above, the sentencing court raised\n\nappellant's sentence in response to her continuing allocution.\n\n            Even if appellant's behavior at sentencing had risen to the\n\nlevel of clear contempt,5 the sentencing court maintains flexibility in\n\nhow to deal with such conduct. See United States v. Pina, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"504377\"><a href=\"/opinion/504377/united-states-v-anthony-j-pina/\"><span class=\"volume\">844</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n14 (1st Cir. 1988) (\"The contempt power, however, is not the only\n\nweapon available to a judge to protect the order and dignity of the\n\ncourtroom in the face of an openly contumacious defendant.\"). One\n\nalternate tool is to remove the contemptuous party from the courtroom,\n\nsee id. at 14-15, as the judge did here.      The fact that the judge\n\nadopted alternate means to deal with a \"defiant\" defendant suggests\n\neven more strongly that the increased sentence was not a contempt\n\nsanction.\n\n\n5 The district court warned appellant that she was becoming \"defiant\"\npart way through her second statement. Appellant then continued to\nspeak, in Spanish. While we do not have a record of appellant's\nSpanish statements, we assume that had appellant's Spanish statements\nrisen to the level of criminal contempt, the district court would have\nstopped appellant, had her comments translated for the record, and made\na contempt finding. In the absence of such action by the district\ncourt, we assume that appellant said nothing which rose to the level of\ncriminal contempt.\n\n                                  -15-\n\f                                   B.\n\n            Second, appellant argues that the district court did not make\n\na clerical, technical, or other clear mistake when imposing the\n\noriginal forty-day sentence, so it lacked authority to later alter that\n\nsentence. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(c) (\"The court, acting within 7 days\n\nafter the imposition of sentence, may correct a sentence that was\n\nimposed as a result of arithmetical, technical, or other clear\n\nerror.\").    Rule 35(c) is a very narrow rule:\n\n            The authority to correct a sentence under this\n            subdivision is intended to be very narrow and to\n            extend only to those cases in which an obvious\n            error or mistake has occurred in the sentence,\n            that is, errors which would almost certainly\n            result in a remand of the case to the trial court\n            for further action under Rule 35(a).          The\n            subdivision is not intended to afford the court\n            the opportunity . . . simply to change its mind\n            about the appropriateness of the sentence.\n\nFed. R. Crim.

Therefore, we\n\naffirm the sixty-day sentence.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n6 Because we hold that there was no alteration under Rule 35(c), we\nfind it unnecessary to address the complicated question of exactly when\na sentence is imposed for purposes of Rule 35(c).
