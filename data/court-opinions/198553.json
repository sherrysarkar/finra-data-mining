BURKE,\r\n\n                    Plaintiff, Appellant,\r\n\n                              v.\r\n\n                   CITY OF BOSTON, ET AL.,\r\n\n                    Defendants, Appellees.\r\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n              FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n       [Hon. Edward F. Harrington, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Lipez, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n        Aldrich and Kravitch, Senior Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   James P. Duggan for appellant.\r\n   Dawna McIntyre, Assistant Corporation Counsel, City of Boston\r\nLaw Department, with whom Merita A. Hopkins, Corporation Counsel,\r\nwas on brief for appellees.\r\n\nJuly 2, 1999\r\n\nPer Curiam.  Plaintiff Elvin Burke sued the City of\r\nBoston and four Boston police officers, alleging a violation of the\r\nMassachusetts Tort Claims Act, several intentional torts, and\r\nviolations of state and federal civil rights laws.  After\r\nplaintiff's properly serving the City, but failing to serve the\r\nfour individual defendants within the requisite time period, the\r\ndistrict court dismissed his claims against all defendants.  We\r\naffirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nThe present action arose from events allegedly taking\r\nplace on October 10, 1994.  Burke maintains that he was unlawfully\r\ndetained, arrested, and beaten by uniformed Boston police officers\r\nwhile he was shopping at an Auto Palace in Roslindale,\r\nMassachusetts.  He was subsequently charged with several assault\r\nand battery counts, among others, but all charges were dismissed\r\nfor want of prosecution on April 3, 1995.\r\nOn July 3, 1997, Burke filed a complaint in the state\r\ncourt, naming the four officers and the City of Boston.  He alleged\r\nthat the City was liable for negligent supervision under the\r\nMassachusetts Tort Claims Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 258, and that\r\nall five defendants had committed state and federal civil rights\r\nviolations, and he accused the four officers of assault and\r\nbattery, civil conspiracy, false arrest, and malicious prosecution. \r\nService was made on the City on July 25, and the City removed the\r\ncase to the district court on August 11 and filed its answer on\r\nOctober 29.  At that point, the four officers had not yet been\r\nserved, and they still had not been served at the time of the first\r\nscheduling conference on December 8.  During that conference,\r\ncounsel for the City stated to the court with Burke's counsel\r\npresent that the four officers still had not been served.  On April\r\n9, 1998, the four officers filed a motion to dismiss for failure to\r\nserve them, and the court allowed the motion on May 15.  The court\r\nalso dismissed the claims against the City of Boston \"on the ground\r\nthat the case has now been dismissed against all the employees of\r\nthe City of Boston.\"  Burke did not respond to the officers'\r\ninitial motion, but filed a motion to vacate the order of dismissal\r\non June 3.  The officers and the City filed a response on June 12,\r\nand Burke filed his supporting memorandum on June 18.  The court\r\ndenied the motion.\r\nBurke now asks us, first, to reverse the dismissal of his\r\nclaims against the four individual officers.  This we decline to\r\ndo.  Federal Rule 4(m) applies here since no service was made prior\r\nto removal, see 28 U.S.C.  1448, and it requires dismissal if\r\nservice is not made within 120 days of the filing of the complaint\r\nunless the plaintiff shows \"good cause\" for the failure.  We review\r\na district court's determination on this question for abuse of\r\ndiscretion.  See Benjamin v. Grossnick, 999 F.2d 590, 591 (1st Cir.\r\n1993).  Burke made no response to the officers' motion to dismiss,\r\ninstead filing a motion to vacate over two weeks after the district\r\ncourt ordered dismissal and a supporting memorandum another two\r\nweeks later, several days after the officers filed their\r\nopposition.  The factors Burke discussed in those filings--the\r\nmerits of his case, the assertion that the police officers knew\r\nthat they were being sued, his participation in a court-ordered\r\nscheduling conference, and his willingness to make expeditious\r\nservice--can hardly be considered reasons, much less \"good cause,\"\r\nfor counsel, as he admitted at oral argument, simply forgetting to\r\nserve the four officers.\r\nBurke claims dismissal on the basis of a technicality\r\ndespite the absence of prejudice to the defendants and his\r\nwillingness to make expeditious service was contrary to the spirit\r\nof the Federal Rules.  He misconstrues the nature of the current\r\nsituation and the applicability of our precedents.  It is true that\r\nwe would not require dismissal where a minor, technical error\r\nresulted in defective service of process but the defendant was not\r\nprejudiced.  See, e.g., Libertad v. Welch, 53 F.3d 428, 440 (1st\r\nCir. 1995); Roque v. United States, 857 F.2d 20, 22 (1st Cir.\r\n1988).  However,  there must first be substantial compliance.  See\r\nPrecision Etchings &amp; Findings v. LGP Gem, Ltd., 953 F.2d 21, 24\r\n(1st Cir. 1992).  Such was entirely lacking here.  This was a case\r\nnot of defective service but of no service at all, and the lack of\r\nprejudice to the defendants (assuming there was none) cannot negate\r\ncounsel's fundamental failure.\r\nThe claims against the City are a different matter.  The\r\nCity did not seek dismissal of the claims against it.  Even after\r\ndismissal without prejudice of all the claims against the\r\nindividual officers, there remained an allegation of federal\r\nconstitutional violations by the City.  The district court also had\r\nsupplemental jurisdiction over the two state law claims against the\r\nCity.  See 28 U.S.C.  1367.  Given these circumstances and the\r\nfact that the City was properly served, it was improper for the\r\ndistrict court to dismiss Burke's claims against it.\r\nThe City's citation to Los Angeles v. Heller, 475 U.S.\r\n796, 798-99 (1986), is misplaced.  Here there has not been a\r\nfinding on the merits that Burke suffered no constitutional injury,\r\nand he may show one even without the officers as individual party\r\ndefendants.\r\nFor the reasons stated, we affirm the district court's\r\ndismissal of Burke's claims against the four individual Boston\r\npolice officers.  We reverse the dismissal of Burke's claims\r\nagainst the City of Boston and remand for further proceedings\r\nconsistent with this opinion.\r\n",
