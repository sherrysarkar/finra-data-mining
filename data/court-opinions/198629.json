Nissenbaum for appellant.\r\nScott P. Lewis, with whom Jordana B. Glasgow, and Palmer &amp;\r\nDodge LLP were on brief, for appellee.\r\n\n                                  \r\n\n              September 8, 1999\r\n                                           TORRUELLA, Chief Judge.  In the underlying action filed\r\nagainst defendant-appellee Rachael Elisabeth Toren (\"the mother\"),\r\nplaintiff-appellant Shlomo Daniel Toren (\"the father\") petitioned\r\nthe district court for an order requiring the immediate return of\r\nhis two minor children from the mother's residence in Massachusetts\r\nto the father's residence in Israel.  The father's action was\r\nbrought pursuant to the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects\r\nof International Child Abduction (\"the Hague Convention\"),\r\nincorporated into United States law by the International Child\r\nAbduction Remedies Act (\"ICARA\"), 42 U.S.C.  11601-11610.  The\r\ndistrict court denied the father's petition, and this appeal\r\nfollowed.\r\n                   BACKGROUND\r\nRachael and Shlomo Toren were married in Israel on\r\nAugust 22, 1988.  Two children were born of this marriage: Dvora,\r\nnow nine years old, and Yael, now six.  In December 1994, the\r\ncouple was divorced by a judgment of the Rabbinical District Court\r\nin Jerusalem.  The divorce judgment incorporated the terms of the\r\nparties' separation agreement, which provided for joint legal\r\ncustody of the children.  The agreement also provided that the\r\nchildren would continue to reside in Israel for at least two years\r\nafter the divorce.\r\nThe parties subsequently amended their separation\r\nagreement via a written agreement dated May 20, 1996.  This\r\nagreement was also approved by the Jerusalem District Court.  The\r\namended agreement provides that the children will live with their\r\nmother in Massachusetts for a period of years, but not beyond\r\nJuly 21, 2000.  The agreement further provides that the children\r\nwill not stay in the United States or any other place outside of\r\nIsrael after that date, and that they will study in Israel during\r\nthe 2000-2001 school year.\r\nThe amended agreement also altered the father's\r\nvisitation rights.  Specifically, the agreement entitles the father \r\nto have the children stay with him every summer, for a period of up\r\nto sixty-five days.  According to the agreement, the mother is\r\nsolely responsible for all of the children's travel expenses to and\r\nfrom Israel for these summer visits.  The agreement also entitles\r\nthe father to have the children visit him in Israel during their\r\nschool vacations at Thanksgiving, at the end of the secular year,\r\nand in the spring.  In addition, if the father travels to the\r\nUnited States, the agreement entitles him to visit with the\r\nchildren, provided he gives advance notice to the mother.  Finally,\r\nthe agreement clearly states that \"the visitation according to this\r\nagreement is subject to change by agreement of the sides,\" and that \r\n\"sole jurisdiction over matters connected with this agreement is\r\nwith the District Court in Jerusalem or in the Family Court,\r\nwhatever applies.\"  \r\nIn July 1996, the mother and the children moved to\r\nMassachusetts.  On July 1, 1997, just prior to the father's\r\nscheduled visit with the children in Massachusetts, the mother\r\nfiled a \"Verified Complaint for Custody\" in the Massachusetts\r\nProbate and Family Court, seeking to modify the terms of the\r\ndivorce judgment issued by the District Court of Jerusalem.  As\r\ngrounds for modification, the mother stated that \"[t]he terms of\r\nthe parties' divorce agreement, and subsequent modification\r\nagreement . . . are no longer in the children's best interests.\" \r\nSpecifically, the mother requested: (1) that the parties' divorce\r\nagreement and subsequent modification agreement be registered in\r\nthe Massachusetts Probate and Family Court; (2) that the terms of\r\nvisitation as set forth in the parties' divorce agreement and\r\nsubsequent modification be further modified by the Massachusetts\r\nProbate and Family Court in a manner consistent with the children's\r\nbest interests; and (3) \"such other relief as [the court] deems\r\nappropriate.\"\r\nOn July 1, 1997, after a hearing ex parte, the probate\r\ncourt granted the mother temporary sole physical and legal custody \r\nof the children, and temporarily suspended the father's rights to\r\nvisitation and access to the children.  The probate court scheduled\r\nfurther hearings on these issues for July 10.\r\nOn July 10, 1997, the probate court issued a \"Further\r\nTemporary Order\" ordering that the mother continue to have sole\r\nlegal and physical custody of the children, subject to the mother\r\nbeing required to submit any and all significant issues relative to\r\nthe children's medical care and education to a guardian ad litem or\r\nmediator.  The order further stated that \"[n]either party shall\r\nremove the children from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without\r\nthe written permission of the other party or of the Court.\"  On the\r\nsame day, both parties also stipulated to a visitation schedule.\r\nOn October 21, 1997, the mother amended her complaint,\r\nmaking substantially the same allegations but also seeking: (1)\r\nmodification of support orders of the Israeli courts, including\r\nthose relating to the cost of visitation; and (2) that \"any related \r\ncustody provisions and orders (including the requirement for joint\r\nlegal custody) . . . be modified by the Probate and Family Court of\r\nthe Commonwealth of Massachusetts in a manner consistent with the\r\nchildren's best interests.\"  The mother also reiterated her request\r\n\"[t]hat this Court grant such other relief as it deems\r\nappropriate.\"\r\nOn July 6, 1998, the father filed this action in the\r\nUnited States District Court for the District of Massachusetts,\r\nalleging that the mother's actions have amounted to a \"wrongful\r\nretention\" of the children within the meaning of Article 3 of the \r\nHague Convention.  In his complaint, the father requested, inter\r\nalia, an order requiring the immediate return of his children from\r\nMassachusetts to Israel.  The mother denied that there had been\r\nany retention (or removal) or any wrongful retention (or removal).\r\nThe district court rejected the father's request for the\r\nimmediate return of the children, basing its decision on two\r\ngrounds.  First, the district court found that the children were\r\n\"habitual residents\" of the United States -- and not Israel -- at\r\nthe time of any allegedly wrongful retention by the mother.  See\r\nToren v. Toren, 26 F. Supp. 2d 240, 243 (D. Mass. 1998).  The court\r\nthen concluded that because the mother was not retaining the\r\nchildren away from their \"habitual residence,\" there was no\r\n\"wrongful retention\" within the meaning of Article 3, see supra\r\nnote 1, and thus the protections of the Hague Convention could not\r\nbe invoked.  See Toren, 26 F. Supp. 2d at 243.  Second, the\r\ndistrict court determined that the father had failed to bring his\r\naction within one year of the allegedly wrongful retention, and\r\nthus Article 12 of the Hague Convention, see supra note 2, barred\r\nhis action.  See Toren, 26 F. Supp. 2d at 244.  Accordingly, the\r\ndistrict court denied the father's petition, and dismissed the\r\nfather's action with prejudice.  This appeal followed.\r\n                   DISCUSSION\r\nWe agree with the district court that the father's\r\npetition for an order requiring that the children be returned to\r\nIsrael should have been dismissed.  However, we disagree with\r\nrespect to the proper grounds for dismissal.  We conclude that the\r\ndistrict court jumped the gun by addressing the issue of the\r\nchildren's habitual residence prior to making the threshold\r\ndetermination as to whether there had been any retention of the\r\nchildren at all within the meaning of the Hague Convention.  \r\nNeither the Hague Convention nor ICARA defines the terms\r\n\"retention\" or \"removal.\"  However, the language and structure of\r\nArticle 3 of the Hague Convention clearly indicate that there must\r\nbe an initial determination as to whether there has been a removal\r\nor retention before any inquiry can be made into whether such\r\nremoval or retention was wrongful.  We conclude that the father\r\nhas failed to allege facts sufficient to set forth a claim that the\r\nToren children have been removed or retained within the meaning of\r\nthe Hague Convention.  Absent such a showing, the district court\r\nshould not have exercised jurisdiction over the father's claim.\r\n\nWe turn to the father's allegations of \"wrongful\r\nretention\" in pursuit of the question of whether there was any\r\nretention or removal, which must be addressed before the issue of\r\nwrongfulness is addressed.  In his complaint, the father seemingly\r\nconcedes the fact that no retention has yet occurred when he refers\r\nto the mother's \"intention to wrongfully retain the children in the\r\nUSA.\"  (emphasis added).  As evidence of this intention, the\r\nfather points to the allegations contained in the mother's\r\n\"Verified Complaint for Custody.\"  Specifically, the father points\r\nto paragraph 23 of the mother's complaint which states only that\r\n\"[n]ow that the children are living in the Commonwealth of\r\nMassachusetts, their quality of life has improved and there are\r\nbetter opportunities for them (including medical care).\"  This\r\nallegation was made, however, in a complaint seeking only\r\nmodification of the parties' visitation agreement.  We fail to see\r\nhow this allegation reveals anything about the mother's intention\r\nto retain the children in Massachusetts after July 21, 2000.  Up\r\nuntil that date, the children's mere presence in the United States\r\ncannot constitute a retention because it is entirely consistent\r\nwith the parties' May 20 agreement.  In addition, while it is\r\nconceivable that the Massachusetts court could deny the father any\r\nvisitation with his children, and that this denial of access could\r\namount to a retention, the fact remains that this turn of events\r\nhas not yet occurred.  Until that happens, we fail to see how a\r\nmere request for modification of the terms of visitation can, in\r\nand of itself, amount to a retention of children.\r\nThe father next points to the mother's \"Verified Amended\r\nComplaint for Custody\" in which she requests that \"this Court grant\r\nsuch other relief as it deems appropriate.\"  The father contends\r\nthat such request is, in essence, a request that the court vacate\r\nthe requirements that the children be returned to Israel on\r\nJuly 21, 2000 and that they visit the father in Israel.  However,\r\nnowhere in her amended complaint does the mother make any \r\nreference to her post-July 21, 2000 plans.  We refuse to infer any\r\nintention of retention from a general request for \"such other\r\nrelief.\"\r\nThe father's next argument is that the mere fact of the\r\nmother's filing of a complaint for custody in the Massachusetts\r\nProbate and Family Court amounts to a wrongful retention.  In\r\nmaking this argument, it is unclear whether the father is\r\ncontending that the mere fact of filing amounts to a wrongful\r\nretention because it further evidences the mother's intent to\r\nretain the children after July 21, 2000, or whether the fact of\r\nfiling amounts to a wrongful retention because it is in violation\r\nof the parties' agreement that \"sole jurisdiction over matters\r\nconnected with [the parties' May 20 agreement] is with the District\r\nCourt in Jerusalem or in the Family Court, whatever applies.\"  As\r\nto the former argument, we reiterate that the mother's complaint\r\nmakes no reference to her post July 21, 2000 plans with respect to\r\nthe return of her children to Israel.  With respect to the latter\r\nargument, while the mother's filing of a complaint for custody in\r\na Massachusetts court may violate the terms of the May 20\r\nagreement, it is in no way linked to the retention of children.\r\nEven if the father had alleged facts sufficient to\r\nsupport his claim that the mother intended to retain the children\r\nin the United States after July 21, 2000, we do not believe that\r\nthe Hague Convention or ICARA would enable us to exercise\r\njurisdiction over such a claim.  To the extent that the father's\r\nargument is based on the mother's future intent, the father is\r\nseeking a judicial remedy for an anticipatory violation of the\r\nHague Convention.  But the Hague Convention only provides a cause\r\nof action to petitioners who can establish actual retention.  See \r\nsupra note 1.  Therefore, we do not see how a petitioner like the\r\nfather, alleging only an anticipatory retention, can invoke the\r\nprotections of the Hague Convention.     \r\nIn addition to his anticipatory retention argument, the\r\nfather articulates a denial of access argument.  This argument is\r\nto the effect that the mother's conduct has so interfered with his\r\nrights of access to the children as to amount to a wrongful\r\nretention within the meaning of the Hague Convention. \r\nSpecifically, the father points to the Further Temporary Order\r\nissued by the Massachusetts Probate Court, requiring both parties\r\nto obtain written permission from the court before removing the\r\nchildren from the Commonwealth.  The father contends that such\r\nrequirement is in direct violation of the terms of the parties'\r\nMay 20 agreement.  Again, it is unclear precisely which provisions\r\nof the May 20 agreement the father claims have been violated.  To\r\nthe extent that the father's argument refers to the jurisdictional\r\nprovisions of the Israeli decree, we reiterate that the appropriate\r\nforum for such an argument is the Massachusetts Probate and Family\r\nCourt.  Such an argument has no bearing on the question before us,\r\nnamely, whether a retention of children has in fact occurred.  To\r\nthe extent that the father is arguing that the order is violative\r\nof the visitation terms set forth in the May 20 agreement, we note\r\nthat the order does not deny visitation rights.  In other words,\r\nwhile the Further Temporary Order clearly imposes an additional\r\nrequirement before the father can exercise his visitation rights,\r\nthe requirement, on its face, does not amount to a denial of access\r\nsufficient to support a claim of a retention.\r\nAt oral argument, the father also articulated -- for the\r\nfirst time -- a theory of de facto denial of access.  The father\r\nargued that because he is a low-income employee, he cannot afford\r\nto travel to the United States to visit with his children.  This\r\nargument cannot prevail for two reasons.  First, it is undisputed\r\nthat both parties agreed that the children would move to the United\r\nStates and reside there with the mother until no later than\r\nJuly 21, 2000.  The father cannot now complain that the terms of\r\nthe May 20 agreement amount to a retention.  Secondly, the father\r\nnever presented this argument to the district court.  It is a well-\r\nsettled principle in this circuit that \"a party . . . may not raise\r\non appeal issues that were not seasonably advanced (and, hence,\r\npreserved) below.\"  See Daigle v. Maine Med. Ctr., Inc., 14 F.3d\r\n684, 687 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\nFinally, we address the father's argument that the\r\nJuly 10, 1997 visitation agreement itself, stipulated to by both\r\nparties, constitutes a denial of access amounting to a wrongful\r\nretention.  First, we note that the parties' May 20 agreement\r\nspecifically provides that \"[t]he visitation according to this\r\nagreement is subject to change by agreement of the sides.\"  As\r\npreviously noted, the July 10 visitation agreement of which the\r\nfather now complains, was stipulated to by both sides.  More\r\nimportantly, the July 10 visitation agreement clearly provides the\r\nfather with access to his children.  Although it may not provide\r\nthe father with visitation on the precise terms that he desires, we\r\ncannot conclude that this stipulated agreement amounts to a\r\nretention of the children.  Again, the father may choose to voice\r\nboth his jurisdictional and substantive objections to the\r\nstipulated visitation agreement in the pending state court\r\nproceedings.\r\nIn conclusion, neither the mother nor any court has\r\ndenied the father access to his children.  Although the mother has\r\nfiled a complaint in the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court\r\nseeking to modify the parties' agreement with respect to custody,\r\nvisitation, and financial support, the father continues to possess\r\nand exercise albeit limited rights of access to his children.  We\r\nrecognize that the father may have valid legal arguments as to why\r\nthe Massachusetts court should not exercise jurisdiction over the\r\nmother's claims.  However, we conclude that the state court -- and\r\nnot this court -- is the proper forum for those arguments.\r\nWe conclude that the father has failed to allege facts\r\nsufficient to state a claim for retention or removal, let alone\r\n\"wrongful\" retention or removal.  For this reason, the district\r\ncourt erred in proceeding directly to an inquiry into\r\n\"wrongfulness.\"  Absent a threshold showing that there has been a\r\nretention or removal, the district court lacked jurisdiction to\r\ngrant or deny the father's petition.  We therefore vacate the\r\ndistrict court opinion and dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.\r\n                   CONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we vacate the district court's\r\nopinion and dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.\n",

The father's action was brought pursuant to the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (\"the Hague Convention\"), incorporated into United States law by the International Child Abduction Remedies Act (\"ICARA\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 11601-11610. The district court denied the father's petition, and this appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rachael and Shlomo Toren were married in Israel on August 22, 1988. Two children were born of this marriage: Dvora, now nine years old, and Yael, now six. In December 1994, the couple was divorced by a judgment of the Rabbinical District Court in Jerusalem. The divorce judgment incorporated the terms of the parties' separation agreement, which provided for joint legal custody of the children. The agreement also provided that the children would continue to reside in Israel for at least two years after the divorce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties subsequently amended their separation agreement via a written agreement dated May 20, 1996. This agreement was also approved by the Jerusalem District Court. The amended agreement provides that the children will live with their mother in Massachusetts for a period of years, but not beyond July 21, 2000. The agreement further provides that the children will not stay in the United States or any other place outside of Israel after that date, and that they will study in Israel during the 2000-2001 school year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The amended agreement also altered the father's visitation rights. Specifically, the agreement entitles the father to have the children stay with him every summer, for a period of up to sixty-five days. According to the agreement, the mother is solely responsible for all of the children's travel expenses to and from Israel for these summer visits. The agreement also entitles the father to have the children visit him in Israel during their school vacations at Thanksgiving, at the end of the secular year, and in the spring. In addition, if the father travels to the United States, the agreement entitles him to visit with the children, provided he gives advance notice to the mother. Finally, the agreement clearly states that \"the visitation according to this agreement is subject to change by agreement of the sides,\" and that \"sole jurisdiction over matters connected with this agreement is with the District Court in Jerusalem or in the Family Court, whatever applies.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1996, the mother and the children moved to Massachusetts. On July 1, 1997, just prior to the father's scheduled visit with the children in Massachusetts, the mother filed a \"Verified Complaint for Custody\" in the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court, seeking to modify the terms of the divorce judgment issued by the District Court of Jerusalem. As grounds for modification, the mother stated that \"[t]he terms of the parties' divorce agreement, and subsequent modification agreement . . . are no longer in the children's best interests.\" Specifically, the mother requested: (1) that the parties' divorce agreement and subsequent modification agreement be registered in the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court; (2) that the terms of visitation as set forth in the parties' divorce agreement and subsequent modification be further modified by the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court in a manner consistent with the children's best interests; and (3) \"such other relief as [the court] deems appropriate.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 1, 1997, after a hearing ex parte, the probate court granted the mother temporary sole physical and legal custody of the children, and temporarily suspended the father's rights to visitation and access to the children. The probate court scheduled further hearings on these issues for July 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 10, 1997, the probate court issued a \"Further Temporary Order\" ordering that the mother continue to have sole legal and physical custody of the children, subject to the mother being required to submit any and all significant issues relative to the children's medical care and education to a guardian ad litem or mediator. The order further stated that \"[n]either party shall remove the children from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without the written permission of the other party or of the Court.\" On the same day, both parties also stipulated to a visitation schedule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 21, 1997, the mother amended her complaint, making substantially the same allegations but also seeking: (1) modification of support orders of the Israeli courts, including those relating to the cost of visitation; and (2) that \"any related custody provisions and orders (including the requirement for joint legal custody) . . . be modified by the Probate and Family Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in a manner consistent with the children's best interests.\" The mother also reiterated her request \"[t]hat this Court grant such other relief as it deems appropriate.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 6, 1998, the father filed this action in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that the mother's actions have amounted to a \"wrongful retention\" of the children within the meaning of Article 3 of the Hague Convention.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In his complaint, the father requested, inter alia, an order requiring the immediate return of his children from Massachusetts to Israel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The mother denied that there had been any retention (or removal) or any wrongful retention (or removal).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected the father's request for the immediate return of the children, basing its decision on two grounds. First, the district court found that the children were \"habitual residents\" of the United States -- and not Israel -- at the time of any allegedly wrongful retention by the mother. See Toren v. Toren, 26 F. Supp. 2d 240, 243 (D. Mass. 1998). The court then concluded that because the mother was not retaining the children away from their \"habitual residence,\" there was no \"wrongful retention\" within the meaning of Article 3, see supra note 1, and thus the protections of the Hague Convention could not be invoked. See Toren, 26 F. Supp. 2d at 243. Second, the district court determined that the father had failed to bring his action within one year of the allegedly wrongful retention, and thus Article 12 of the Hague Convention, see supra note 2, barred his action. See Toren, 26 F. Supp. 2d at 244. Accordingly, the district court denied the father's petition, and dismissed the father's action with prejudice. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court that the father's petition for an order requiring that the children be returned to Israel should have been dismissed. However, we disagree with respect to the proper grounds for dismissal. We conclude that the district court jumped the gun by addressing the issue of the children's habitual residence prior to making the threshold determination as to whether there had been any retention of the children at all within the meaning of the Hague Convention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither the Hague Convention nor ICARA defines the terms \"retention\" or \"removal.\" However, the language and structure of Article 3 of the Hague Convention clearly indicate that there must be an initial determination as to whether there has been a removal or retention before any inquiry can be made into whether such removal or retention was wrongful.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> We conclude that the father has failed to allege facts sufficient to set forth a claim that the Toren children have been removed or retained within the meaning of the Hague Convention. Absent such a showing, the district court should not have exercised jurisdiction over the father's claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn to the father's allegations of \"wrongful retention\" in pursuit of the question of whether there was any retention or removal, which must be addressed before the issue of wrongfulness is addressed. In his complaint, the father seemingly concedes the fact that no retention has yet occurred when he refers to the mother's \"intention to wrongfully retain the children in the USA.\" (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> As evidence of this intention, the father points to the allegations contained in the mother's \"Verified Complaint for Custody.\" Specifically, the father points to paragraph 23 of the mother's complaint which states only that \"[n]ow that the children are living in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, their quality of life has improved and there are better opportunities for them (including medical care).\" This allegation was made, however, in a complaint seeking only modification of the parties' visitation agreement. We fail to see how this allegation reveals anything about the mother's intention to retain the children in Massachusetts after July 21, 2000. Up until that date, the children's mere presence in the United States cannot constitute a retention because it is entirely consistent with the parties' May 20 agreement. In addition, while it is conceivable that the Massachusetts court could deny the father any visitation with his children, and that this denial of access could amount to a retention, the fact remains that this turn of events has not yet occurred. Until that happens, we fail to see how a mere request for modification of the terms of visitation can, in and of itself, amount to a retention of children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The father next points to the mother's \"Verified Amended Complaint for Custody\" in which she requests that \"this Court grant such other relief as it deems appropriate.\" The father contends that such request is, in essence, a request that the court vacate the requirements that the children be returned to Israel on July 21, 2000 and that they visit the father in Israel. However, nowhere in her amended complaint does the mother make any reference to her post-July 21, 2000 plans. We refuse to infer any intention of retention from a general request for \"such other relief.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The father's next argument is that the mere fact of the mother's filing of a complaint for custody in the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court amounts to a wrongful retention. In making this argument, it is unclear whether the father is contending that the mere fact of filing amounts to a wrongful retention because it further evidences the mother's intent to retain the children after July 21, 2000, or whether the fact of filing amounts to a wrongful retention because it is in violation of the parties' agreement that \"sole jurisdiction over matters connected with [the parties' May 20 agreement] is with the District Court in Jerusalem or in the Family Court, whatever applies.\" As to the former argument, we reiterate that the mother's complaint makes no reference to her post July 21, 2000 plans with respect to the return of her children to Israel. With respect to the latter argument, while the mother's filing of a complaint for custody in a Massachusetts court may violate the terms of the May 20 agreement, it is in no way linked to the retention of children.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the father had alleged facts sufficient to support his claim that the mother intended to retain the children in the United States after July 21, 2000, we do not believe that the Hague Convention or ICARA would enable us to exercise jurisdiction over such a claim. To the extent that the father's argument is based on the mother's future intent, the father is seeking a judicial remedy for an anticipatory violation of the Hague Convention. But the Hague Convention only provides a cause of action to petitioners who can establish actual retention. See supra note 1. Therefore, we do not see how a petitioner like the father, alleging only an anticipatory retention, can invoke the protections of the Hague Convention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to his anticipatory retention argument, the father articulates a denial of access argument. This argument is to the effect that the mother's conduct has so interfered with his rights of access to the children as to amount to a wrongful retention within the meaning of the Hague Convention.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Specifically, the father points to the Further Temporary Order issued by the Massachusetts Probate Court, requiring both parties to obtain written permission from the court before removing the children from the Commonwealth. The father contends that such requirement is in direct violation of the terms of the parties' May 20 agreement. Again, it is unclear precisely which provisions of the May 20 agreement the father claims have been violated. To the extent that the father's argument refers to the jurisdictional provisions of the Israeli decree, we reiterate that the appropriate forum for such an argument is the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court. Such an argument has no bearing on the question before us, namely, whether a retention of children has in fact occurred. To the extent that the father is arguing that the order is violative of the visitation terms set forth in the May 20 agreement, we note that the order does not deny visitation rights. In other words, while the Further Temporary Order clearly imposes an additional requirement before the father can exercise his visitation rights, the requirement, on its face, does not amount to a denial of access sufficient to support a claim of a retention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument, the father also articulated -- for the first time -- a theory of de facto denial of access. The father argued that because he is a low-income employee, he cannot afford to travel to the United States to visit with his children. This argument cannot prevail for two reasons. First, it is undisputed that both parties agreed that the children would move to the United States and reside there with the mother until no later than July 21, 2000. The father cannot now complain that the terms of the May 20 agreement amount to a retention. Secondly, the father never presented this argument to the district court. It is a well-settled principle in this circuit that \"a party . . . may not raise on appeal issues that were not seasonably advanced (and, hence, preserved) below.\" See Daigle v. Maine Med. Ctr., Inc., 14 F.3d 684, 687 (1st Cir. 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we address the father's argument that the July 10, 1997 visitation agreement itself, stipulated to by both parties, constitutes a denial of access amounting to a wrongful retention. First, we note that the parties' May 20 agreement specifically provides that \"[t]he visitation according to this agreement is subject to change by agreement of the sides.\" As previously noted, the July 10 visitation agreement of which the father now complains, was stipulated to by both sides. More importantly, the July 10 visitation agreement clearly provides the father with access to his children. Although it may not provide the father with visitation on the precise terms that he desires, we cannot conclude that this stipulated agreement amounts to a retention of the children. Again, the father may choose to voice both his jurisdictional and substantive objections to the stipulated visitation agreement in the pending state court proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In conclusion, neither the mother nor any court has denied the father access to his children. Although the mother has filed a complaint in the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court seeking to modify the parties' agreement with respect to custody, visitation, and financial support, the father continues to possess and exercise albeit limited rights of access to his children. We recognize that the father may have valid legal arguments as to why the Massachusetts court should not exercise jurisdiction over the mother's claims. However, we conclude that the state court -- and not this court -- is the proper forum for those arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the father has failed to allege facts sufficient to state a claim for retention or removal, let alone \"wrongful\" retention or removal. For this reason, the district court erred in proceeding directly to an inquiry into \"wrongfulness.\" Absent a threshold showing that there has been a retention or removal, the district court lacked jurisdiction to grant or deny the father's petition. We therefore vacate the district court opinion and dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the foregoing, we vacate the district court's opinion and dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p>  Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  Article 3 of the Hague Convention provides in relevant part that:</p>\n        <p>The removal or the retention of a child is to be considered wrongful where --</p>\n        <p>a.\t it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person, an institution or any other body, either jointly or alone, under the law of the State in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention; and</p>\n        <p>b.\t at the time of removal or retention those rights were actually exercised, either jointly or alone, or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>  Article 12 of the Hague Convention provides:</p>\n        <p>Where a child has been wrongfully removed or retained in terms of Article 3 and, at the date of the commencement of the proceedings before the judicial or administrative authority of the Contracting State where the child is, a period of less than one year has elapsed from the date of the wrongful removal or retention, the authority concerned shall order the return of the child forthwith.</p>\n        <p>The judicial or administrative authority, even where the proceedings have been commenced after the expiration of the period of one year referred to in the preceding paragraph, shall also order the return of the child, unless it is demonstrated that the child is now settled in its new environment.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Article 3 reads: \"The removal or the retention of a child is to be considered wrongful where . . . .\" The structure of this Article clearly establishes the proper order of inquiry: first, the court should inquire into whether there has been any removal or retention at all; and second, the court should inquire into whether such removal or retention has been wrongful.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p>  Later in the complaint, the father states: \"When the MOTHER and children departed from Israel, the FATHER had no idea that the MOTHER was thinking about not permitting the children to be available to the FATHER or thinking about not returning the children to Israel in full accordance with the parties' agreement.\" (emphasis added).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p>  It is possible that the filing of the mother's complaint does in fact violate the terms of the parties' May 20 agreement.

The father's action was brought pursuant to the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (\"the Hague Convention\"), incorporated into United States law by the International Child Abduction Remedies Act (\"ICARA\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 11601-11610. The district court denied the father's petition, and this appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rachael and Shlomo Toren were married in Israel on August 22, 1988. Two children were born of this marriage: Dvora, now nine years old, and Yael, now six. In December 1994, the couple was divorced by a judgment of the Rabbinical District Court in Jerusalem. The divorce judgment incorporated the terms of the parties' separation agreement, which provided for joint legal custody of the children. The agreement also provided that the children would continue to reside in Israel for at least two years after the divorce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties subsequently amended their separation agreement via a written agreement dated May 20, 1996. This agreement was also approved by the Jerusalem District Court. The amended agreement provides that the children will live with their mother in Massachusetts for a period of years, but not beyond July 21, 2000. The agreement further provides that the children will not stay in the United States or any other place outside of Israel after that date, and that they will study in Israel during the 2000-2001 school year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The amended agreement also altered the father's visitation rights. Specifically, the agreement entitles the father to have the children stay with him every summer, for a period of up to sixty-five days. According to the agreement, the mother is solely responsible for all of the children's travel expenses to and from Israel for these summer visits. The agreement also entitles the father to have the children visit him in Israel during their school vacations at Thanksgiving, at the end of the secular year, and in the spring. In addition, if the father travels to the United States, the agreement entitles him to visit with the children, provided he gives advance notice to the mother. Finally, the agreement clearly states that \"the visitation according to this agreement is subject to change by agreement of the sides,\" and that \"sole jurisdiction over matters connected with this agreement is with the District Court in Jerusalem or in the Family Court, whatever applies.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1996, the mother and the children moved to Massachusetts. On July 1, 1997, just prior to the father's scheduled visit with the children in Massachusetts, the mother filed a \"Verified Complaint for Custody\" in the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court, seeking to modify the terms of the divorce judgment issued by the District Court of Jerusalem. As grounds for modification, the mother stated that \"[t]he terms of the parties' divorce agreement, and subsequent modification agreement . . . are no longer in the children's best interests.\" Specifically, the mother requested: (1) that the parties' divorce agreement and subsequent modification agreement be registered in the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court; (2) that the terms of visitation as set forth in the parties' divorce agreement and subsequent modification be further modified by the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court in a manner consistent with the children's best interests; and (3) \"such other relief as [the court] deems appropriate.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 1, 1997, after a hearing ex parte, the probate court granted the mother temporary sole physical and legal custody of the children, and temporarily suspended the father's rights to visitation and access to the children. The probate court scheduled further hearings on these issues for July 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 10, 1997, the probate court issued a \"Further Temporary Order\" ordering that the mother continue to have sole legal and physical custody of the children, subject to the mother being required to submit any and all significant issues relative to the children's medical care and education to a guardian ad litem or mediator. The order further stated that \"[n]either party shall remove the children from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without the written permission of the other party or of the Court.\" On the same day, both parties also stipulated to a visitation schedule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 21, 1997, the mother amended her complaint, making substantially the same allegations but also seeking: (1) modification of support orders of the Israeli courts, including those relating to the cost of visitation; and (2) that \"any related custody provisions and orders (including the requirement for joint legal custody) . . . be modified by the Probate and Family Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in a manner consistent with the children's best interests.\" The mother also reiterated her request \"[t]hat this Court grant such other relief as it deems appropriate.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 6, 1998, the father filed this action in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that the mother's actions have amounted to a \"wrongful retention\" of the children within the meaning of Article 3 of the Hague Convention.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In his complaint, the father requested, inter alia, an order requiring the immediate return of his children from Massachusetts to Israel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The mother denied that there had been any retention (or removal) or any wrongful retention (or removal).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected the father's request for the immediate return of the children, basing its decision on two grounds. First, the district court found that the children were \"habitual residents\" of the United States -- and not Israel -- at the time of any allegedly wrongful retention by the mother. See Toren v. Toren, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2406893\"><a href=\"/opinion/2406893/toren-v-toren/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">240</span></a></span>, 243 (D. Mass. 1998). The court then concluded that because the mother was not retaining the children away from their \"habitual residence,\" there was no \"wrongful retention\" within the meaning of Article 3, see supra note 1, and thus the protections of the Hague Convention could not be invoked. See Toren, 26 F. Supp. 2d at 243. Second, the district court determined that the father had failed to bring his action within one year of the allegedly wrongful retention, and thus Article 12 of the Hague Convention, see supra note 2, barred his action. See Toren, 26 F. Supp. 2d at 244. Accordingly, the district court denied the father's petition, and dismissed the father's action with prejudice.

Again, it is unclear precisely which provisions of the May 20 agreement the father claims have been violated. To the extent that the father's argument refers to the jurisdictional provisions of the Israeli decree, we reiterate that the appropriate forum for such an argument is the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court. Such an argument has no bearing on the question before us, namely, whether a retention of children has in fact occurred. To the extent that the father is arguing that the order is violative of the visitation terms set forth in the May 20 agreement, we note that the order does not deny visitation rights. In other words, while the Further Temporary Order clearly imposes an additional requirement before the father can exercise his visitation rights, the requirement, on its face, does not amount to a denial of access sufficient to support a claim of a retention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument, the father also articulated -- for the first time -- a theory of de facto denial of access. The father argued that because he is a low-income employee, he cannot afford to travel to the United States to visit with his children. This argument cannot prevail for two reasons. First, it is undisputed that both parties agreed that the children would move to the United States and reside there with the mother until no later than July 21, 2000. The father cannot now complain that the terms of the May 20 agreement amount to a retention. Secondly, the father never presented this argument to the district court. It is a well-settled principle in this circuit that \"a party . . . may not raise on appeal issues that were not seasonably advanced (and, hence, preserved) below.\" See Daigle v. Maine Med. Ctr., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195171\"><a href=\"/opinion/195171/daigle-v-maine-medical/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">684</span></a></span>, 687 (1st Cir. 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we address the father's argument that the July 10, 1997 visitation agreement itself, stipulated to by both parties, constitutes a denial of access amounting to a wrongful retention. First, we note that the parties' May 20 agreement specifically provides that \"[t]he visitation according to this agreement is subject to change by agreement of the sides.\" As previously noted, the July 10 visitation agreement of which the father now complains, was stipulated to by both sides. More importantly, the July 10 visitation agreement clearly provides the father with access to his children. Although it may not provide the father with visitation on the precise terms that he desires, we cannot conclude that this stipulated agreement amounts to a retention of the children. Again, the father may choose to voice both his jurisdictional and substantive objections to the stipulated visitation agreement in the pending state court proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In conclusion, neither the mother nor any court has denied the father access to his children. Although the mother has filed a complaint in the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court seeking to modify the parties' agreement with respect to custody, visitation, and financial support, the father continues to possess and exercise albeit limited rights of access to his children. We recognize that the father may have valid legal arguments as to why the Massachusetts court should not exercise jurisdiction over the mother's claims. However, we conclude that the state court -- and not this court -- is the proper forum for those arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the father has failed to allege facts sufficient to state a claim for retention or removal, let alone \"wrongful\" retention or removal. For this reason, the district court erred in proceeding directly to an inquiry into \"wrongfulness.\" Absent a threshold showing that there has been a retention or removal, the district court lacked jurisdiction to grant or deny the father's petition. We therefore vacate the district court opinion and dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the foregoing, we vacate the district court's opinion and dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p>  Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  Article 3 of the Hague Convention provides in relevant part that:</p>\n        <p>The removal or the retention of a child is to be considered wrongful where --</p>\n        <p>a.\t it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person, an institution or any other body, either jointly or alone, under the law of the State in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention; and</p>\n        <p>b.\t at the time of removal or retention those rights were actually exercised, either jointly or alone, or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>  Article 12 of the Hague Convention provides:</p>\n        <p>Where a child has been wrongfully removed or retained in terms of Article 3 and, at the date of the commencement of the proceedings before the judicial or administrative authority of the Contracting State where the child is, a period of less than one year has elapsed from the date of the wrongful removal or retention, the authority concerned shall order the return of the child forthwith.</p>\n        <p>The judicial or administrative authority, even where the proceedings have been commenced after the expiration of the period of one year referred to in the preceding paragraph, shall also order the return of the child, unless it is demonstrated that the child is now settled in its new environment.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Article 3 reads: \"The removal or the retention of a child is to be considered wrongful where . . . .\" The structure of this Article clearly establishes the proper order of inquiry: first, the court should inquire into whether there has been any removal or retention at all; and second, the court should inquire into whether such removal or retention has been wrongful.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p>  Later in the complaint, the father states: \"When the MOTHER and children departed from Israel, the FATHER had no idea that the MOTHER was thinking about not permitting the children to be available to the FATHER or thinking about not returning the children to Israel in full accordance with the parties' agreement.\" (emphasis added).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p>  It is possible that the filing of the mother's complaint does in fact violate the terms of the parties' May 20 agreement.
