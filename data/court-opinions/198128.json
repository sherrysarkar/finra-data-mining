  "plain_text": "[NOT FOR PUBLICATION   NOT TO BE CITED AS PRECEDENT]\r\n\nUnited States Court of Appeals\r\nFor the First Circuit\r\n\nNo. 97-2233\r\n\nPRIME RETAIL, L.P.,\r\n\nPlaintiff, Appellant,\r\n\n         v.\r\n\nCARIBBEAN AIRPORT FACILITIES, INC.,\r\n\nDefendant, Appellee.\r\n\nAPPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\r\n\n[Hon. Jose Antonio Fuste, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n       Before\r\n\nTorruella, Chief Judge,\r\n\nCampbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\nand Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\nFrancis B. Burch, Jr., with whom Charles P. Scheeler and Piper\r\n&amp; Marbury, L.L.P. were on brief, for appellant.\r\nEdgar Cartagena-Santiago, with whom Ramn E. Dapena, Ina M.\r\nBerlingeri-Vincenty, and Goldman Antonetti &amp; Cordova were on brief,\r\nfor appellee.\r\n\nSeptember 16, 1998\r\n\n           Per curiam.  Having carefully reviewed the Memorandum on\r\nRemand entered by the district court in response to our opinion\r\ndated May 28, 1998, we find that the supplemental conclusions\r\ndescribed therein, which are predominantly factual in nature, are\r\nnot clearly erroneous and adequately fill the gaps we perceived to\r\nexist in the court's previous findings.  We have no basis,\r\ntherefore, to disturb the district court's disposition of the\r\nplaintiff's claims.  The judgment entered below is accordingly\r\naffirmed.  No costs are awarded.\r\nSo ordered.\n",
