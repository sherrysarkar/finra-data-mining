Defendant-appellant, John  W.

The  determination  is fact-\r\n\nspecific and may be based on circumstantial evidence and on a\r\n\nview  of  the whole  of  the  defendant's pertinent  conduct.\r\n\nUnited States v. Joyce, 70 F.3d 679, 682 (1st Cir. 1995).\r                                  \r\n\n          The facts showed that the defendant was  one of the\r\n\nprimary actors  in the  conceiving and  carrying  out of  the\r\n\ncross-burning,  including the transport of other participants\r\n\nin  his vehicle and  setting fire to the  cross.  These facts\r\n\nand  other  record  evidence  support  the  district  court's\r\n\nfinding that the defendant  \"participated in the initial idea\r\n\nwith  regard   to   the  cross-burning   offense,   that   he\r\n\nparticipated  in   the  planning  and   preparation  for  the\r\n\ncommission of the offense,  that he in fact actually  lit the\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\ncross  on fire,\" and, thus,  played a leadership  role in the\r\n\ncommission  of  the  offense.

Any error with\r\n\nrespect  to   this  sentence  would  not   have  altered  the\r\n\ndefendant's combined adjusted  offense level  of fourteen  or\r\n\naffected  the  sentencing range.    \"[W]hen  correction of  a\r\n\nfinding  would not  change  the applicable  offense level  or\r\n\naffect  the  sentencing   range,  any  error   therein  would\r\n\nnecessarily be harmless.\"  United States v.
