Petitioner  Luis Rosado has  filed an\r                                \r\n\napplication for a  writ of  habeas corpus under  28 U.S.C.   \r\n\n2254.  In it, he argues  that the Maine statute setting forth\r\n\nthe circumstances under which a juvenile may be prosecuted as\r\n\nan adult,  see 15  M.R.S.A.    3101(4), violates  due process\r                          \r\n\nbecause it directs the juvenile court to use  a preponderance\r\n\nof the evidence standard in determining when such prosecution\r\n\nis required; Rosado maintains that  the Constitution mandates\r\n\na standard  of clear and  convincing evidence.   The district\r\n\ncourt  denied the application for the writ on the merits, but\r\n\ngranted a certificate of probable cause to appeal.\r\n\n          We treat  this certificate as a recommendation that\r\n\nwe  issue a  certificate  of appealability  (\"CAP\") under  28\r\n\nU.S.C.   2253, as amended  by the Antiterrorism and Effective\r\n\nDeath  Penalty Act of 1996.   See 28  U.S.C.   2253(c)(1)(B).\r                                             \r\n\nWe  agree  that  a  substantial  question  is  presented  and\r\n\ntherefore grant Rosado's request for  a CAP.  However,  since\r\n\nwe  believe that  oral argument  would not be  of significant\r\n\nassistance -- the parties have fully briefed the case and the\r\n\nissue turns on parsing Supreme Court precedents -- we proceed\r\n\ndirectly to the merits.\r\n\n          Three circuit courts  of appeal have addressed  the\r\n\nsame question  in relation to the  federal transfer provision\r\n\ncontained in the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency  Prevention\r\n\nAct.    See 18  U.S.C.    5032.    These courts  hold  that a\r                       \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\npreponderance  of  the  evidence  standard is  all  that  due\r\n\nprocess requires.  See United States v. I.D.P., 102 F.3d 507,\r                                                          \r\n\n513-14 (11th  Cir. 1996);  United States  v. T.F.F.,  55 F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\n1118, 1122 (6th  Cir. 1995);  United States v.  Doe, 49  F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\n859, 868 (2d Cir. 1995).  We agree with the result reached by\r\n\nthese  courts.   Because  the cases  adequately  set out  the\r\n\nrelevant  analysis,  including  reference  to  the  pertinent\r\n\nSupreme Court cases, we  see no reason to repeat it here, but\r\n\nwe  believe that  a published  opinion by  this court  may be\r\n\nuseful to district courts in this circuit.\r\n\n          Finally, Rosado  cites a  number of state  cases in\r\n\nsupport of his position that due process requires a clear and\r\n\nconvincing evidence  standard.  Examination reveals  that the\r\n\ncourts in these cases either adopted such a standard by court\r\n\nrule or by  reference to  a state statute  so providing;  the\r\n\ncourts that did  consider due process  claims did not  decide\r\n\nwhat minimum standard of proof was required.\r                        \r\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\r                                                                    \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
