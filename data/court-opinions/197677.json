His  flagship claim  requires  us to\r\n\ninvestigate  the  circumstances  under  which  the  Confrontation\r\n\nClause  allows  a  prosecution  witness  to  testify  by  foreign\r\n\ndeposition  over  the  defendant's  objection.    After carefully\r\n\nconsidering  this issue  (a matter  of  first impression  in this\r\n\ncircuit) and assaying the appellant's other points, we affirm.\r\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          Mindful of the appellant's challenge to the sufficiency\r\n\nof  the evidence, we limn the  facts in the light most flattering\r\n\nto the jury's verdict.  See United States v. Staula, 80 F.3d 596,\r                                                             \r\n\n599 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 156 (1996).\r                                      \r\n\n          The appellant and his business partner, Shelagh McNeil,\r\n\nboth   citizens  of   the   United   Kingdom,   operated   McNeil\r\n\nInternational,  Ltd. (MIL), a company organized under the laws of\r\n\nScotland.    Through   it,  the  pair  brokered   various  export\r\n\ntransactions.  In  1994, Peter Sullivan, the owner  of Afromed (a\r\n\nMaltese firm), approached  the appellant about acquiring  a large\r\n\nquantity  of  computer  equipment  for  the  Libyan   government.\r\n\nMcKeeve agreed to handle the transaction and began to investigate\r\n\nits logistical aspects.\r\n\n          McKeeve contacted  the United  Kingdom's Department  of\r\n\nTrade and Industry (DTI) to ascertain whether British authorities\r\n\nwould require  him to obtain  an export license to  ship computer\r\n\nequipment from the United Kingdom to Libya.  DTI advised him that\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nhe  probably needed  such a  license, and  at  some point,  a DTI\r\n\nofficial also informed  him that most computer  equipment shipped\r\n\nto Libya wound  up in munitions factories.   Hot on the  heels of\r\n\nthis contact,  Eric Lane,  an investigator  for British  Customs,\r\n\npaid the appellant  a visit.  Lane stated  that U.S. restrictions\r\n\non trade with Libya were more stringent than those of the  United\r\n\nKingdom,  and advised  McKeeve that  he  should confer  with U.S.\r\n\nCustoms  if he contemplated exporting computer equipment from the\r\n\nUnited States.\r\n\n          During  the fall  of 1995  the  appellant designated  a\r\n\nMassachusetts  firm, New England Computer Exchange (NEXL), as the\r\n\nvendor  of  choice to  supply  the  $300,000  worth  of  computer\r\n\nequipment   needed  to  fill   Afromed's  order.     When  NEXL's\r\n\nrepresentatives (Cliff Rucker  and Deepak Jain) learned  that the\r\n\nappellant wanted to  transship the equipment  through Cyprus    a\r\n\nnotorious   clearinghouse  for   goods  destined   for  embargoed\r\n\ncountries    they expressed  concern about  the ultimate  resting\r\n\nplace of the computer equipment.  The appellant prevaricated  and\r\n\ntold them that the goods were bound for Ethiopia.\r\n\n          McKeeve  and   McNeil  proceeded   to  instruct   their\r\n\nstateside  shipping agent,  Peabody and  Lane  (P&amp;L), to  arrange\r\n\nshipment only as far as  Cyprus.  Simultaneously, they directed a\r\n\nBritish  shipping   agent,  Alex  Redpath,  to   arrange  freight\r\n\nforwarding  to  Libya  and, when  Redpath  warned  that the  U.S.\r\n\ntrading  embargo  posed  potential  difficulties,  the  appellant\r\n\nmerely reiterated the instruction.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\n          On  October 12, 1995, the appellant oversaw the packing\r\n\nof  the  computer  equipment  at  NEXL's  warehouse  in  Reading,\r\n\nMassachusetts.   A  trucker delivered  the goods,  in  a shipping\r\n\ncontainer,  to port in  Charlestown, Massachusetts.   Acting on a\r\n\ntip, the U.S. Customs Service ordered the container held at port.\r\n\nBecause this delay  threatened to undercut  the letter of  credit\r\n\nthat Afromed  had produced  to pay for  the goods,  the appellant\r\n\nflew to Malta and met with Sullivan.\r\n\n          At about the same time, the appellant instructed P&amp;L to\r\n\ndischarge  the computer  equipment in  Antwerp,  Belgium (a  port\r\n\nthrough  which it  already  was  scheduled to  pass  en route  to\r\n\nCyprus).   When a  P&amp;L agent informed  McNeil about  this change,\r\n\nMcNeil  advised her  to  maintain  Cyprus as  the  port of  final\r\n\ndestination.    The  appellant  subsequently  confirmed  McNeil's\r\n\ninstruction.\r\n\n          Despite  these  machinations,  the  computer  equipment\r\n\nstayed put.  Although it originally was due to depart Charlestown\r\n\non October 18, it remained on customs hold a full week later.  On\r\n\nOctober  25, McNeil contacted  NEXL's chief executive  and stated\r\n\nthat if he (Rucker) did not sign the Shipper's Export Declaration\r\n\n(SED), a  U.S. Customs  export document  that lists, among  other\r\n\nthings, the ultimate destination of  the goods, no payment  would\r\n\nbe  forthcoming.   McNeil transmitted  an unsigned SED  to Rucker\r\n\nthat listed \"Cyprus, Greece\" as  the port of unloading and Greece\r\n\nas the country of ultimate  destination.  Rucker called McNeil to\r\n\nreport  the apparent  discrepancy and  McNeil  instructed him  to\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\ndelete  Greece and  insert Ethiopia  as the  country of  ultimate\r\n\ndestination.  Rucker made the requested changes, signed  the SED,\r\n\nand transmitted a facsimile to McNeil.  Notwithstanding the newly\r\n\nexecuted SED, the customs hold endured.\r\n\n          On   October  31,  the   U.S.  Customs  Service  became\r\n\nconvinced  that the  appellant  sought surreptitiously  to export\r\n\ngoods to Libya.  A customs agent, posing as a seaport supervisor,\r\n\nconvinced  the  appellant  to  return to  Boston  and  address  a\r\n\npaperwork snafu that ostensibly prevented vacation of the customs\r\n\nhold.  During a meeting  with undercover customs agents, captured\r\n\non  videotape,  the   appellant  vouchsafed  that  the   computer\r\n\nequipment  was  destined for  Ethiopia  and signed  a  false SED.\r\n\nShortly thereafter, the  authorities arrested him and  seized the\r\n\ncomputer equipment.\r\n\n          A  federal grand jury indicted the appellant on charges\r\n\nthat  he  knowingly  violated  the  International  Emergency  and\r\n\nEconomic Powers Act  (IEEPA), 50 U.S.C.     1701-1706 (1994), and\r\n\nits  associated Executive Orders and regulations, Exec. Order No.\r\n\n12,924,  3 C.F.R. 917  (1994) &amp; Exec. Order  No. 12,543, 3 C.F.R.\r\n\n181 (1986),  both reprinted  in 50  U.S.C.    1701;  31 C.F.R.   \r                                         \r\n\n550.202 (1997);  15 C.F.R.     774.1,  785.7(a), 787.3(a),  787.6\r\n\n(1997); conspired to  violate IEEPA, 18 U.S.C.    371 (1994); and\r\n\nmade false  statements to the  U.S. Customs Service, 18  U.S.C.  \r\n\n1001 (1994).  The grand jury also indicted McKeeve's and McNeil's\r\n\ncorporation, MIL, on  several related counts, but did  not charge\r\n\nit with participating  in the conspiracy.  The  bill named McNeil\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nas an unindicted coconspirator, but  neither she nor Sullivan was\r\n\nnamed as  a defendant (presumably  because they  were beyond  the\r\n\ncourt's jurisdiction).\r\n\n          At  trial, the appellant admitted that Libya always had\r\n\nbeen  the  intended  destination  for  the   computer  equipment.\r\n\nNevertheless,  he professed that  he only belatedly  became aware\r\n\nthat his actions might violate U.S. law and that, when he learned\r\n\nof  the problem,  he  tried  to \"slow  down\"  the transaction  by\r\n\ndischarging  the equipment  in Antwerp for  eventual sale  in the\r\n\nUnited Kingdom.   He  attempted to explain  away his  false claim\r\n\nthat Ethiopia  was  the  country  of ultimate  destination  as  a\r\n\nstandard   broker's  business  practice   designed  to  mask  his\r\n\ncustomer's identity.\r\n\n          The jury  weighed  the  evidence,  concluded  that  the\r\n\nappellant  knew   all  along   that  U.S.   law  prohibited   the\r\n\ntransaction,  and convicted  him on  all counts.   The  jury also\r\n\nfound MIL guilty  as charged.  The district  court sentenced both\r\n\ndefendants, but only McKeeve perfected an appeal.\r\n\nII.  THE FOREIGN DEPOSITION\r          II.  THE FOREIGN DEPOSITION\r\n\n          The  appellant objects in this court,  as he did below,\r\n\nto admission at trial of  the deposition testimony of the British\r\n\nshipping  agent, Alex Redpath.   His cardinal  contention is that\r\n\nthe  admission of  this evidence  abrogated his rights  under the\r\n\nConfrontation Clause.  We exercise plenary review over this claim\r\n\nof constitutional error.   See United States v.  Stokes, 124 F.3d\r                                                                 \r\n\n39, 42 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\n                      A.  Setting the Stage.\r                                A.  Setting the Stage\r                                                     \r\n\n          The parties   who agree on little else   share the view\r\n\nthat  Redpath  was a  key  witness.   Initially,  the prosecution\r\n\ngained  Redpath's assurances that  he would travel  to the United\r\n\nStates  and  testify at  the  trial.   As  the  day  of reckoning\r\n\napproached, Redpath experienced a  change of heart.   Because the\r\n\ndistrict  court lacked subpoena power over Redpath (who lived and\r\n\nworked  in Great  Britain),  the government  moved  for leave  to\r\n\ndepose him  abroad.   The motion invoked  a procedural  rule that\r\n\nprovides in pertinent part:\r\n\n          Whenever due to  exceptional circumstances of\r\n          the case  it is  in the  interest of  justice\r\n          that the testimony  of a prospective  witness\r\n          of a party be taken  and preserved for use at\r\n          trial,  the court  may  upon motion  of  such\r\n          party and  notice to  the parties  order that\r\n          testimony  of   such  witness  be   taken  by\r\n          deposition . . . .\r\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 15(a).\r\n\n          The government proposed  to mitigate any  Confrontation\r\n\nClause  issues by transporting  the appellant and  his counsel to\r\n\nthe site of the deposition and videotaping the proceedings.  This\r\n\nproposal proved problematic  for two  reasons.   First, the  U.S.\r\n\nMarshals  Service lacks jurisdiction to retain custody of federal\r\n\ndetainees on foreign soil and the Central Authority of the United\r\n\nKingdom would not agree to assume temporary custody of McKeeve so\r\n\nthat   he  could  attend   the  deposition.1     Second,  British\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The  appellant asserts that  the government did  not make a\r\nbona  fide effort  to  facilitate  his  attendance  at  Redpath's\r\ndeposition.    The  record,  which  includes  the  correspondence\r\nbetween the two governments, refutes this assertion.\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nmagistrates typically prohibit the videotaping and audiotaping of\r\n\ndepositions,  and  made  no  exception  in  this  instance.   The\r\n\ndistrict  court nonetheless found that Redpath was an unavailable\r\n\nwitness   and  that  the   interest  of  justice   warranted  the\r\n\ndeposition.   Working  within the  spare confines of  the British\r\n\nscheme,  the court  directed  the  government  to  transport  the\r\n\nappellant's  attorney  to  the  deposition  and  to  install  two\r\n\ntelephone lines    one that would allow the  appellant to monitor\r\n\nthe deposition from his prison  cell and another that would allow\r\n\nhim to consult privately with counsel during the deposition.  The\r\n\ncourt  reserved a ruling  on the Confrontation  Clause objections\r\n\nuntil the time of trial.\r\n\n          Redpath's  deposition   was  taken  before   a  British\r\n\nmagistrate  in  the  Solihull  Magistrates'  Court,   Birmingham,\r\n\nEngland.    Lawyers for  the government  and for  both defendants\r\n\nattended and questioned  the deponent.  A solicitor  (who doubled\r\n\nin    brass   as   the   clerk   of   the   Magistrates'   Court)\r\n\ncontemporaneously prepared a transcript.  The appellant monitored\r\n\nthe proceedings  by  means of  a  live telephone  link.   At  the\r\n\nconclusion of the session, the solicitor certified the transcript\r\n\nas accurate  and forwarded it  to the  district court.   When the\r\n\nprosecution subsequently offered the  deposition at trial,  Judge\r\n\nKeeton  overruled  the  appellant's objections  and  allowed  the\r\n\ngovernment to read it into evidence.\r\n\n                     B.  The Legal Landscape.\r                               B.  The Legal Landscape.\r                                                      \r\n\n          The use of  deposition testimony in criminal  trials is\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\ndisfavored, largely  because such  evidence tends  to diminish  a\r\n\ndefendant's  Sixth Amendment  confrontation rights.   See,  e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nUnited States  v. Drogoul,  1 F.3d 1546,  1551 (11th  Cir. 1993);\r                                   \r\n\nUnited States v.  Mann, 590 F.2d 361,  365 (1st Cir. 1978).   But\r                                \r\n\nthe  shrinking size  of  the globe  means  that certain  criminal\r\n\nactivities  increasingly  manifest an  international  cachet and,\r\n\nbecause  federal courts  frequently lack  the  power to  compel a\r\n\nforeign national's  attendance at  trial, Rule  15 may  offer the\r\n\nonly  practicable  means  of procuring  critical  evidence.   The\r\n\nresultant  tension between  the defendant's  Confrontation Clause\r\n\nrights and the prosecution's need to obtain evidence from persons\r\n\ndomiciled abroad, while  new to this circuit, threatens to become\r\n\na recurring theme.\r\n\n          The  various subsections of  Rule 15 govern  the method\r\n\nand  manner by  which depositions  in  criminal cases  are to  be\r\n\ntaken.   The  appellant  tacitly  concedes  that  the  taking  of\r\n\nRedpath's  deposition  did  not   contravene  the  rule's  formal\r\n\nrequirements.    Nevertheless,  compliance  with  Rule  15  is  a\r\n\nnecessary,  but  not  sufficient,  condition  to  the  use  of  a\r\n\ndeposition at trial.  The admissibility of the testimony is quite\r\n\nanother  matter.   See Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 15(e).   The  appellant\r                                \r\n\ncloaks himself  in  the mantle  of the  Confrontation Clause  and\r\n\nmakes his stand at this juncture.\r\n\n          The Confrontation Clause's \"central concern . . . is to\r\n\nensure  the  reliability  of  the  evidence  against  a  criminal\r\n\ndefendant by subjecting it to  rigorous testing in the context of\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nan adversary proceeding  before the trier of fact.\"   Maryland v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nCraig,  497 U.S.  836, 845  (1990).   The  Clause addresses  that\r               \r\n\nconcern principally by  affording a criminal defendant  the right\r\n\nto confront  appearing witnesses  face to face  and the  right to\r\n\nconduct rigorous cross-examination  of those witnesses.

Ritchie, 480\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S.  39, 51 (1987);  see also Ohio  v.

Ordinarily,  then,  when   the\r\n\ngovernment purposes to introduce a deposition at trial in lieu of\r\n\nlive testimony,  a defendant has  the right to be  present during\r\n\nthe  deposition  so that  he  may  confront  the deponent.    See\r                                                                           \r\n\nChristian v. Rhode, 41 F.3d 461, 465 (9th Cir. 1994); Don v. Nix,\r                                                                          \r\n\n886 F.2d 203, 206 (8th Cir. 1989).\r\n\n          Withal,  we  know on  the  best of  authority  that the\r\n\nConfrontation Clause cannot be applied mechanically, but, rather,\r\n\nmust be interpreted  \"in the context of the  necessities of trial\r\n\nand the adversary  process.\"  Craig, 497  U.S. at 850.   In other\r                                             \r\n\nwords,  the  right  of  confrontation  is  not  absolute.    Yet,\r\n\nfiltering  constitutional  concerns  through  a  seine  woven  of\r\n\npractical   necessity  is   a  tricky  business,   and  different\r\n\nsituations likely will yield different accommodations.\r\n\n          When the  government conducts a Rule 15 deposition in a\r\n\nforeign  land with  a view  toward introducing  it at  trial, the\r\n\nConfrontation  Clause requires, at a minimum, that the government\r\n\nundertake  diligent   efforts  to   facilitate  the   defendant's\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\npresence.  See United States v. Kelly, 892 F.2d 255, 262 (3d Cir.\r                                               \r\n\n1989); United States v. Salim, 855  F.2d 944, 950 (2d Cir. 1988).\r                                       \r\n\nWe  caution,  however,   that  although  such  efforts   must  be\r\n\nundertaken  in good  faith,  they  need not  be  heroic, and  the\r\n\npossibility of  using a  deposition does  not  evaporate even  if\r\n\nthose efforts prove fruitless.   In that event the district court\r\n\nmust  determine,  on a  case-specific  basis, whether  reasonable\r\n\nalternative  measures  can  preserve adequately  the  values that\r\n\nunderpin  the defendant's confrontation  rights.  In  cases where\r\n\nactions by, or the laws of, a foreign nation effectively preclude\r\n\nthe  defendant's  presence,  furnishing  the defendant  with  the\r\n\ncapability for  live monitoring of  the deposition, as well  as a\r\n\nseparate (private) telephone line for consultation with  counsel,\r\n\nusually will  satisfy the  demands of  the Confrontation  Clause.\r\n\nSee United  States v. Mueller,  74 F.3d 1152, 1156-57  (11th Cir.\r                                       \r\n\n1996); Kelly, 892 F.2d at 260; Salim, 855 at 950.\r                                              \r\n\n          C.  The Appellant's Constitutional Challenge.\r                    C.  The Appellant's Constitutional Challenge.\r                                                                \r\n\n          In this case,  the record reveals that  the prosecution\r\n\nmade  reasonable and diligent  efforts to secure  the appellant's\r\n\nattendance at  Redpath's deposition:   it offered  to defray  the\r\n\ncost  of  transporting the  appellant  and  his  counsel  to  the\r\n\ndeposition   and  requested   that  British   authorities  accept\r\n\ntemporary custody of  him to ensure his presence.  Only a lack of\r\n\ncooperation   by  the   host  nation   stymied  the   appellant's\r\n\nappearance,  and the Justice  Department was powerless  to coerce\r\n\nBritish assistance.   The appellant  points to nothing  more that\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\nthe prosecution plausibly  could have done to  facilitate a face-\r\n\nto-face   confrontation.    What   is  more,  when   the  British\r\n\nauthorities   balked,   Judge  Keeton   fashioned   a  reasonable\r\n\nalternative,   and  the   prosecution   provided  the   requisite\r\n\ntelephonic  links between  the appellant's  prison  cell and  the\r\n\nSolihull Magistrates' Court.  Under the prevailing circumstances,\r\n\nthe   government's  efforts  to  secure  (or,  alternatively,  to\r\n\napproximate) a  face-to-face confrontation  were constitutionally\r\n\nadequate.\r\n\n          This   finding,  in   itself,  does   not  defeat   the\r\n\nappellant's constitutional challenge.  Face-to-face confrontation\r\n\nin a  courtroom setting  has yet another  virtue; it  permits the\r\n\ntrier of fact better to observe a witness's demeanor.  See Craig,\r                                                                          \r\n\n497  U.S. at 846;  Drogoul, 1 F.3d  at 1552.   Like the  right of\r                                    \r\n\nconfrontation itself, however, this value is not absolute.  Thus,\r\n\neven  when a  witness is  unavailable  to testify  at trial,  the\r\n\nClause  countenances  the  admission  of  certain   extrajudicial\r\n\nstatements   as  long  as  they  possess  sufficient  indicia  of\r\n\nreliability.  See Roberts, 448 U.S. at 65-66; Puleio v. Vose, 830\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 1197, 1205 (1st Cir. 1987).\r\n\n          For  this  purpose,  \"[r]eliability   can  be  inferred\r\n\nwithout  more in a case where  the evidence falls within a firmly\r\n\nrooted hearsay exception.\"   Roberts, 448 U.S.  at 66.  So  it is\r                                              \r\n\nhere:   Fed.  R. Evid.  804(b)(1) limns  a hearsay  exception for\r\n\nformer testimony  of an  unavailable witness.   This  exception's\r\n\nroots are deeply embedded in  American jurisprudence.  See, e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nMattox v. United States, 156 U.S. 237, 240-44 (1895).  Consistent\r                                 \r\n\nwith   this  tradition,  courts  seem  disinclined  to  find  any\r\n\nConfrontation Clause  transgression when  the prosecution  offers\r\n\ndeposition testimony under this rule.  See, e.g., Ecker v. Scott,\r                                                                          \r\n\n69 F.3d 69, 71 (5th Cir. 1995); Kelly, 892 F.2d at 261-62; Salim,\r                                                                          \r\n\n855 F.2d at 954-55.  We join  these courts and hold that evidence\r\n\nproperly within  the former  testimony hearsay  exception is,  by\r\n\ndefinition,   not  vulnerable  to  a  challenge  based  upon  the\r\n\nConfrontation Clause.\r\n\n          To  bring  Redpath's  testimony within  the  protective\r\n\nembrace of this  holding, the government had to  make a threshold\r\n\nshowing (1)  that the witness  was unavailable, and (2)  that the\r\n\ndeposition constituted former testimony.  The appellant  contests\r\n\nboth points.\r\n\n          The  standard test  for unavailability  is  whether the\r\n\nwitness's  attendance  could  be procured  \"by  process  or other\r\n\nreasonable  means.\"   Fed. R.  Evid.  804(a)(5).   In a  criminal\r\n\ncontext, however, Confrontation  Clause concerns  color the  Rule\r\n\n804  availability inquiry and  heighten the  government's burden.\r\n\nSee Ecker, 69 F.3d at 71-72.  Thus, the prosecution must actively\r                   \r\n\nattempt  to  secure   the  witness's  presence  at  trial.    See\r                                                                           \r\n\nChristian, 41  F.3d  at  467.   Here,  as  we  noted  above,  the\r                   \r\n\ngovernment made an assiduous effort to convince Redpath to attend\r\n\nthe  trial.   We  fail to  discern any  further  action that  the\r\n\nprosecutor  reasonably  could  have taken  to  bring  the witness\r\n\nbefore the jury.\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\n          The remaining question  is whether Redpath's deposition\r\n\namounted  to \"former  testimony\"  within the  purview of  Fed. R.\r\n\nEvid. 804(b)(1).   The appellant's  objection on this score  is a\r\n\nbare assertion that the method of transcribing the proceeding was\r\n\n\"slow and inexact.\"2  We  must balance this complaint against the\r\n\ndominant   characteristics   of  the   deposition,   namely,  the\r\n\nadministration of an oath; unlimited direct and cross-examination\r\n\nby attorneys  for all parties;  the ability to  lodge objections;\r\n\noversight  by  a   judicial  officer;  the  compilation   of  the\r\n\ntranscript by  a trained  solicitor; and the  lack of  a language\r\n\nbarrier.\r\n\n          To  be  sure, the  deposition  did not  comport  in all\r\n\nrespects with American practice, but that circumstance alone does\r\n\nnot  render the  testimony  not  \"in  compliance  with  law\"  and\r\n\ntherefore beyond the  reach of Rule 804(b)(1).  We agree with the\r\n\nSecond Circuit that \"unless the manner of examination required by\r\n\nthe  law  of  the  host   nation  is  so  incompatible  with  our\r\n\nfundamental principles  of fairness or so prone  to inaccuracy or\r\n\nbias  as to render  the testimony inherently unreliable,  . . . a\r\n\ndeposition taken  . . .  in accordance with  the law of  the host\r\n\nnation is  taken `in  compliance with law'  for purposes  of Rule\r\n\n804(b)(1).\"   Salim,  855 F.2d  at 953.   The  British proceeding\r                             \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2The  appellant   offers  no  convincing  examples   of  any\r\ninexactitude.   His  only  supporting  datum  is  an  unamplified\r\nstatement  by  counsel  for  MIL,  as follows:    \"There  is  one\r\nparticular  phrase that has    that is a  crucial question that I\r\nremember  going  in  as  a different  question.\"    The  specific\r\nquestion and answer never have been identified.\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\nsubstantially  jibes with  our practice  and  thus satisfies  the\r\n\nrule.\r\n\n          The  appellant's  final  plaint  is  that  the  Redpath\r\n\ndeposition was not  videotaped.  History undermines  this plaint.\r\n\nThe  former  testimony  exception  to  the  Confrontation  Clause\r\n\npredates  the development of  videotaping technology by  nearly a\r\n\ncentury.  See Mattox,  156 U.S. at 240-44.   Thus, the  exception\r                              \r\n\nobviously does not envision the need to present the trier of fact\r\n\nwith a video recording  of the declarant's testimony.   In a case\r\n\nlike this one   where the host nation prohibits videotaping   the\r\n\ndistrict  court's refusal to  condition its authorization  of the\r\n\ndeposition on  the use  of such  a technique did  not offend  the\r\n\nConstitution.\r\n\n          We hasten  to add, however, that our opinion should not\r\n\nbe read to  discourage the use of videotaped  depositions in this\r\n\ntype  of  situation.    Having  the trier  of  fact  observe  the\r\n\ntestimonial  demeanor   of   the   witness   enhances   important\r\n\nConfrontation Clause values, including the perception of fairness\r\n\nin criminal trials.  See Craig, 497 U.S. at 846; Coy, 487 U.S. at\r                                                              \r\n\n1018-20.     For  these  reasons,  although  videotaping  is  not\r\n\nconstitutionally  required,  we  urge  the  district  courts,  if\r\n\nvideotaping  is   feasible,  to  give  serious  consideration  to\r\n\ngranting defendants' requests to employ the technique.\r\n\n          To  sum up, the  Redpath deposition satisfies  the Rule\r\n\n804(b)(1)  standard.   Moreover,  the very  characteristics which\r\n\ncontribute to that conclusion    e.g., administration of an oath;\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\nunlimited   direct  and   cross-examination;  ability   to  lodge\r\n\nobjections; oversight by  a judicial officer; compilation  of the\r\n\ntranscript by a trained solicitor; and linguistic compatibility  \r\n\nalso provide  sufficient indicia  of reliability  to assuage  any\r\n\nreasonable  Confrontation Clause concerns.  See Roberts, 448 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\nat 66; Salim, 855 F.2d at 954-55.  The district court did not err\r                      \r\n\nin admitting the deposition testimony into evidence.\r\n\nIII.  THE CONSPIRACY CONVICTION \r          III.  THE CONSPIRACY CONVICTION \r\n\n          The appellant launches a  barrage of nearly unthirlable\r\n\narguments  directed  toward  his  conviction  for  conspiracy  to\r\n\nviolate IEEPA.  These arguments land well wide of the mark.\r\n\n          IEEPA  codifies Congress's intent  to confer  broad and\r\n\nflexible power upon the President to impose  and enforce economic\r\n\nsanctions against  nations that the  President deems a  threat to\r\n\nnational security interests.   See United States v.  Arch Trading\r                                                                           \r\n\nCo., 987 F.2d  1087, 1093-94 (4th  Cir. 1993).   Included in  the\r             \r\n\nPresident's IEEPA authority is the right to prohibit persons from\r\n\nengaging  in  commercial transactions  with such  hostile foreign\r\n\nnations.  See  U.S.C.   1702(a)(1)(B).  The  appellant reads this\r                       \r\n\nprovision  as applying  only to  persons who  are subject  to the\r\n\njurisdiction  of the  United  States.   He  then  posits that  as\r\n\nneither of his  supposed accomplices fell within  the territorial\r\n\njurisdiction  of  the  United States  when  the  events  at issue\r\n\ntranspired   McNeil and Sullivan are  domiciliaries of the United\r\n\nKingdom  and Malta, respectively, and neither of them entered the\r\n\nUnited States during  the relevant time frame   they could not in\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\nterms violate IEEPA.  A  person cannot conspire with himself, the\r\n\nappellant's thesis runs, and to suggest that McNeil  and Sullivan\r\n\nwere coconspirators  in this  matter implies  that IEEPA's  reach\r\n\nextends extraterritorially    a result inconsonant with  both the\r\n\nstatutory  text   and   the   traditional   presumption   against\r\n\nextraterritoriality.   See United  States v. Nippon  Paper Indus.\r                                                                           \r\n\nCo.,  109 F.3d  1, 3  (1st Cir.),  petition for  cert.  filed, 65\r                                                                       \r\n\nU.S.L.W. 3839 (U.S. June 13, 1997) (No. 96-1987).   Based on this\r\n\nreasoning,  the  appellant  concludes that  any  agreement  among\r\n\nMcNeil,  Sullivan,  and  himself concerning  the  exportation  of\r\n\ncomputers  to  Libya  cannot  form  the  basis  for a  conspiracy\r\n\nconviction.\r\n\n          This  theory  is  both procedurally  and  substantively\r\n\ninfirm.  As  a matter of procedure, the theory makes its debut in\r\n\nMcKeeve's appellate brief, and \"[i]f any  principle is settled in\r\n\nthis  circuit,  it   is  that,  absent  the   most  extraordinary\r\n\ncircumstances,  legal theories not  raised squarely in  the lower\r\n\ncourt  cannot  be  broached  for  the  first  time  on   appeal.\"\r\n\nTeamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers Union  v. Superline\r                                                                           \r\n\nTransp. Co.,  953 F.2d  17, 21  (1st Cir.  1992).   There are  no\r                     \r\n\nexcusatory circumstances here.\r\n\n          Despite this procedural  default, we could still,  as a\r\n\nmatter of discretion,  review the argument for plain  error.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited States v. Taylor,  54 F.3d 967, 972 (1st Cir.  1995).  But\r                                 \r\n\nso detailed a review is unnecessary here, for there is  no error,\r\n\nplain or otherwise.  The  appellant's theory overlooks a critical\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\ncomponent  of IEEPA's  framework.    Among  other  things,  IEEPA\r\n\nexpressly   confers  on  the  President  the  power  to  prohibit\r\n\ncommercial  transactions  with  certain   foreign  nations  \"with\r\n\nrespect to any property . . . subject to the jurisdiction  of the\r\n\nUnited States.\"  50 U.S.C.    1702(a)(1).  The computer equipment\r\n\naround  which the conspiracy centered was stored in Massachusetts\r\n\nand  unquestionably subject  to the  jurisdiction  of the  United\r\n\nStates.  Accordingly,  as long as either McNeil  or Sullivan knew\r\n\nthe  locus of the equipment and knew that U.S. law prohibited its\r\n\nexport to Libya,3 the ensuing agreement with the appellant had an\r\n\nunlawful  design  sufficient to  animate  the  federal conspiracy\r\n\nstatute.\r\n\n          In the case at hand, the government adduced ample proof\r\n\nof both propositions.  The record contains abundant evidence that\r\n\nMcNeil,  at  least, was  aware  of U.S.  export  restrictions and\r\n\npurposefully sought  to evade them.   Of particular note  are her\r\n\nsuccessful  efforts to  coerce Rucker  into signing  an SED  that\r\n\nfalsely described  the ultimate destination of the  goods and her\r\n\ncountermanding of the suggestion that  the goods be discharged in\r\n\nAntwerp.  In addition,  the nisi prius roll shows  beyond hope of\r\n\ncontradiction  that the  appellant  performed  an  overt  act  in\r\n\nfurtherance of  the conspiracy  when he  purchased the  equipment\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3To  support the conviction,  the government only  needed to\r\nprove that  the appellant conspired  with one other person.

OTHER ALLEGED TRIAL ERRORS\r\n\n          The  appellant  raises  a host  of  issues  that relate\r\n\nloosely  to his oft-repeated claim that he did not receive a fair\r\n\ntrial.   Individually,  these issues  are  insubstantial, and  in\r\n\ncombination they produce no synergistic effect.\r\n\n              A.  Admission of Sullivan's Statement.\r                        A.  Admission of Sullivan's Statement.\r                                                             \r\n\n          In  a  protest  that  harks  back  to  his  sufficiency\r\n\nchallenge,  the appellant takes umbrage with the district court's\r\n\ndecision to admit,  over his objection, evidence  of certain out-\r\n\n                                19\r\r\n\nof-court  statements allegedly made by Sullivan to third parties.\r\n\nThe  statements, as recounted by Redpath, specifically linked the\r\n\nappellant to Sullivan; showed that Sullivan acted throughout with\r\n\na view toward transshipping the computer equipment through Cyprus\r\n\nto  Libya;  and  undermined the  appellant's  testimony  that his\r\n\nattempt to off-load the equipment in Antwerp was not a ruse, but,\r\n\nrather, a sincere effort to  abort the transaction once he became\r\n\naware  that it  would violate  U.S. law.   We  customarily review\r\n\ndecisions to  admit or exclude evidence for  abuse of discretion,\r\n\nsee  United States  v. Houlihan,  92  F.3d 1271,  1296 (1st  Cir.\r                                         \r\n\n1996), cert.  denied, 117 S.  Ct. 963 (1997), and  we follow that\r                              \r\n\npraxis here.\r\n\n          The trial court admitted the challenged evidence on the\r\n\nauthority  of  Fed.  R.  Evid.  801(d)(2)(E),  which  creates  an\r\n\nexception to the hearsay rule for  extrajudicial statements \"by a\r\n\ncoconspirator of a party during  the course and in furtherance of\r\n\nthe  conspiracy.\"   The appellant's  principal  objection to  the\r\n\ncourt's action stems  from his extraterritoriality argument.   We\r\n\npreviously rejected  that argument, see  supra Part III,  and the\r                                                        \r\n\ntheory  that undergirds  it  fares no  better  in an  evidentiary\r\n\ncontext.\r\n\n          The second  prong of the appellant's objection suggests\r\n\nthat  the  government  did  not  adduce  sufficient  evidence  of\r\n\nSullivan's involvement to  bring his statements within  the reach\r\n\nof Rule  801(d)(2)(E).  This  prong rests on an  impeccable legal\r\n\nfoundation.    An  out-of-court  statement  of  a  non-testifying\r\n\n                                20\r\r\n\ncoconspirator is admissible  under Rule 801(d)(2)(E) only  if the\r\n\ndistrict court supportably finds that \"it is more likely than not\r\n\nthat  the  declarant  and  the  defendant  were  members  of  the\r\n\nconspiracy when  the  hearsay statement  was made,  and that  the\r\n\nstatement was in furtherance  of the conspiracy.\"  United  States\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Petrozziello, 548  F.2d 20, 23 (1st Cir.  1977); accord United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 715 (1st Cir. 1992).\r                         \r\n\n          Factually,  however,  the  objection falls  flat.   The\r\n\ngovernment showed  that Sullivan  headed Afromed;  that his  name\r\n\nappeared   on  numerous   documents  created   pursuant  to   the\r\n\ntransaction;  that he was in constant  contact with the appellant\r\n\nregarding the status of the project (including the customs hold);\r\n\nand  that he was  responsible for arranging  transshipment of the\r\n\ngoods to the Libyan purchaser.  The record also shows that, while\r\n\nin the  United States,  the appellant sent  Sullivan a  memo that\r\n\nadvised Sullivan to use extreme  caution in contacting him and to\r\n\nbe very careful what he said in any such communication.  In light\r\n\nof  this  evidentiary   predicate,  the  district  court   had  a\r\n\nreasonable  basis  for  concluding that,  more  likely  than not,\r\n\nMcKeeve  and Sullivan  were  coconspirators and  that  Sullivan's\r\n\ncomments to  Redpath were made  during and in furtherance  of the\r\n\nconspiracy.   Consequently,  the  decision  to  admit  Sullivan's\r\n\nhearsay  statements under  the  coconspirator  exception did  not\r\n\nconstitute an abuse of discretion.\r\n\n                B.  Admission of Lane's Testimony.\r                          B.  Admission of Lane's Testimony.\r                                                           \r\n\n          During  trial, Eric Lane,  a British  customs official,\r\n\n                                21\r\r\n\ntestified that  the appellant  spoke to  him anent  DTI's earlier\r\n\nwarning that  virtually all computers  sent to Libya ended  up in\r\n\narms  factories.   The appellant  objected to  this  testimony on\r\n\nrelevancy  grounds and added  that, to  the extent  the testimony\r\n\nmight  otherwise be  admissible, it  was unduly prejudicial.   He\r\n\nargued  then, and  reasserts now,  that since  U.S. law  bans the\r\n\nexport  of any product  (except certain humanitarian  aid) to any\r\n\nLibyan entity, the fact that  a DTI official had warned him  that\r\n\ncomputer shipments would be used to outfit Libyan arms  factories\r\n\nis irrelevant  to any crime charged  in the indictment.   For its\r\n\npart, the government points to the appellant's admission  that he\r\n\nknew all along  that the U.S. embargo at  least paralleled United\r\n\nNations  sanctions   (which  explicitly  prohibit   the  sale  of\r\n\nequipment destined for  Libyan military applications),  and that,\r\n\nin light of this  admission, Lane's testimony tended  to undercut\r\n\nthe appellant's  claim  that  he  did  not  realize  the  Afromed\r\n\ntransaction transgressed U.S. law.\r\n\n          The district court accepted  the government's position,\r\n\nbut told the jury that  it could consider the proffered testimony\r\n\nonly with  regard to  McKeeve's state of  mind (i.e.,  whether he\r\n\nplotted to contravene  the Libyan embargo in knowing violation of\r\n\nIEEPA) and  not for the truth of the  matter asserted.  We review\r\n\nthis decision  for abuse of discretion.  See Houlihan, 92 F.3d at\r                                                               \r\n\n1297.  We detect no abuse either in the trial court's decision to\r\n\nadmit Lane's testimony as probative of McKeeve's state of mind or\r\n\nin its refusal to exclude the proffer under Fed. R. Evid. 403.\r\n\n                                22\r\r\n\n          The relevancy objection requires  scant comment.   Fed.\r\n\nR. Evid.  401 deems relevant  evidence that has \"any  tendency to\r\n\nmake  the existence  of any fact  that is  of consequence  to the\r\n\ndetermination of the action more  probable or less probable  than\r\n\nit  would  be  without the  evidence.\"    The  instant indictment\r\n\ncharged the appellant with knowingly and willfully violating, and\r\n\nconspiring to violate, IEEPA.  His state of mind, assessable only\r\n\nby  indirect proof,  see United  States v.  St. Michael's  Credit\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnion,  880  F.2d 579,  600  (1st  Cir.  1989), was  of  critical\r               \r\n\nimportance to the resolution of these charges.  When, as now, the\r\n\nprosecution offers evidence  bearing on an inherently  subjective\r\n\ninquiry, the  relevancy threshold is  at its lowest.   See United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Tierney,  760 F.2d 382, 387  (1st Cir. 1985).   Seen in\r                           \r\n\nthis light,  Judge Keeton reasonably could conclude   as, indeed,\r\n\nhe did    that McKeeve's knowledge of  the likely end use  of the\r\n\ncomputer equipment tended to make less probable his state-of-mind\r\n\ndefense.    Hence,  the  judge  did  not  err  in  admitting  the\r\n\nstatement.\r\n\n          The Rule 403  objection is similarly unavailing.   That\r\n\nrule directs a trial court to exclude relevant evidence if, inter\r                                                                           \r\n\nalia, \"its  probative value  is substantially  outweighed by  the\r              \r\n\ndanger of unfair prejudice.\"  But almost all evidence is meant to\r\n\nbe prejudicial   why else would  a party seek to introduce it?   \r\n\nand  it  is  only  unfairly  prejudicial evidence  that  must  be\r\n\nbanished.   See United States v. Rodriguez-Estrada, 877 F.2d 153,\r                                                            \r\n\n156  (1st Cir.  1989).    Although the  Lane  testimony may  have\r\n\n                                23\r\r\n\nprejudiced the  appellant in  the sense that  it fit,  tongue and\r\n\ngroove,  into the  prosecution's  theory of  the  case, there  is\r\n\nnothing unfair  about the jury's  weighing of it for  the limited\r\n\npurpose of determining  the appellant's state of mind.   For this\r\n\nreason, we decline the appellant's invitation to second-guess the\r\n\ndistrict  judge's evidentiary gravimetry.  See Freeman v. Package\r                                                                           \r\n\nMach.

Because the appellant did not lodge a contemporaneous\r\n\nobjection  to  this  testimony, we  ordinarily  would  review his\r\n\nbelated challenge for plain error.  See United States v. Griffin,\r                                                                          \r\n\n818  F.2d  97,  99-100  (1st  Cir. 1987).    Here,  however,  the\r\n\ncircumstances  obviate any need to  engage in plain error review.\r\n\nSee United States v. Castro-Lara, 970 F.2d 976, 981 n.5 (1st Cir.\r                                          \r\n\n1992) (explaining that, if  no error inheres, plain error  review\r\n\nbecomes a superfluous step).\r\n\n          The government called Harmon to establish the existence\r\n\nand  effect  of  the economic  sanctions  imposed  against Libya.\r\n\n                                24\r\r\n\nHarmon's description of  the purpose behind the  embargo provided\r\n\nthe  jury with  relevant background  information  that helped  to\r\n\nstitch together an  appropriate context in  which the jury  could\r\n\nassess  the  evidence  introduced during  the  trial.   Admitting\r\n\nHarmon's statement  was well  within the  realm  of the  district\r\n\ncourt's discretion.   See, e.g.,  Castro-Lara, 970  F.2d at  981;\r                                                       \r\n\nUnited  States v.  Daly,  842  F.2d 1380,  1388  (2d Cir.  1988).\r                                 \r\n\nTrials are meaty affairs, and  appellate courts should not insist\r\n\nthat all  taste be extracted  from a piece  of evidence before  a\r\n\njury can chew on it.\r\n\n                  D.  Prosecutorial Misconduct.\r                            D.  Prosecutorial Misconduct.\r                                                        \r\n\n          The appellant's next assignment of error  is predicated\r\n\non a  claim  that the  prosecutor overstepped  her bounds  during\r\n\nopening and  closing arguments.   This claim is  a superscription\r\n\nthat grows out of the prosecutor's references to Lane's testimony\r\n\nin her  opening  statement  and  to  Harmon's  testimony  in  her\r\n\nsummation.  Because the prosecutor, on each occasion, did no more\r\n\nthan describe accurately  testimony that the  jury would hear  or\r\n\nalready  had heard, the  assignment of error fails.   At least in\r\n\nthe  absence of  highly  exceptional circumstances  (not  present\r\n\nhere), a comment by counsel in  the course of jury summation that\r\n\nmerely  recounts  properly  admitted  testimony,  accurately  and\r\n\nwithout embellishment or distortion, cannot constitute reversible\r\n\nerror.  See  Jentges v. Milwaukee County Circuit  Court, 733 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n1238, 1242 (7th Cir. 1984).  So, too, a comment  in the course of\r\n\nan  opening statement that  merely presages subsequently admitted\r\n\n                                25\r\r\n\ntestimony cannot constitute reversible error.  See id.\r                                                                \r\n\nV.  SENTENCING\r          V.  SENTENCING\r\n\n          The  district court sentenced the appellant to a prison\r\n\nterm  of 51  months,  the  low end  of  the applicable  guideline\r\n\nsentencing range (offense level 24; criminal history category I).\r\n\nSalvaging scant succor from  this fact, the appellant  strives to\r\n\npersuade  us that  the  court  made two  material  errors in  its\r\n\nsentencing calculations.  We are unconvinced.\r\n\n            A.  Evasion of National Security Controls.\r                      A.  Evasion of National Security Controls.\r                                                               \r\n\n          With respect to export control offenses, the sentencing\r\n\nguidelines provide  for a base  offense level (BOL) of  14 unless\r\n\n\"national  security  or   nuclear  proliferation  controls   were\r\n\nevaded,\" in which case the BOL escalates to 22.   USSG  2M5.1(a).\r\n\nThe lower  court found that  the offense of  conviction qualified\r\n\nfor the eight-level enhancement.  The  appellant claims that this\r\n\nruling  is  based on  an  erroneous  reading  of the  enhancement\r\n\nprovision.  Because  this claim implicates the  meaning and scope\r\n\nof the guideline, our  review is plenary.   See United States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nMuniz, 49 F.3d 36, 41 (1st Cir. 1995).\r               \r\n\n          The  appellant's   core   contention   is   that   USSG\r\n\n 2M5.1(a)(1)  cannot apply  in a  sale-of-goods  case unless  the\r\n\ngovernment presents evidence  that the particular goods,  when or\r\n\nif sold,  constitute an actual  threat to national security.   We\r\n\ndisagree.    In   Executive  Order  No.  12,543,   the  President\r\n\ndetermined  that Libya posed an \"unusual and extraordinary threat\r\n\nto the national security and foreign policy of the United States\"\r\n\n                                26\r\r\n\nand  therefore ordered  an embargo  covering  the exportation  of\r\n\nvirtually all  goods to  Libya.   The embargo  is an  exercise of\r\n\nexecutive power authorized by IEEPA \"to deal with any unusual and\r\n\nextraordinary threat .  . . to the national security.\"  50 U.S.C.\r\n\n  1701.  In short, the embargo is intended as a national security\r\n\ncontrol.\r\n\n          That   ends  the  matter.    As  we  read  it,  section\r\n\n2M5.1(a)(1) applies to  any offense that involves  a shipment (or\r\n\nproposed shipment)  that offends the embargo, whether  or not the\r\n\ngoods shipped actually  are intended for some innocent  use.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited States v. Shetterly, 971 F.2d 67, 76 (7th Cir. 1992).  The\r                                    \r\n\nappellant's  argument to  the contrary  seeks  to substitute  the\r\n\njudgment of a factfinder for  that of the executive branch, which\r\n\nhas made  a determination that the export  of any goods to Libya,\r\n\nexcepting  only  certain  humanitarian  aid,  threatens  national\r\n\nsecurity interests.  Such a course is fraught with separation-of-\r\n\npowers perils, see Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.  518,\r                                                           \r\n\n527 (1988)  (noting the primacy of presidential  power to protect\r\n\nnational security interests), and we eschew it.\r\n\n                   B.  Obstruction of Justice.\r                             B.  Obstruction of Justice.\r                                                       \r\n\n          The   appellant's   remaining  complaint   is   equally\r\n\nunavailing.    At  the disposition  hearing,  the  district court\r\n\nincreased the  appellant's BOL for  obstruction of justice.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nUSSG  3C1.1.   The  court based this  two-level enhancement  on a\r\n\nfinding  that McKeeve committed perjury when he testified that he\r\n\ndid  not  know  his  actions  violated U.S.  law.    We  review a\r\n\n                                27\r\r\n\nsentencing  court's factbound finding of perjury for clear error.\r\n\nSee United States v. Akitoye, 923 F.2d 221, 229 (1st Cir. 1991).\r                                      \r\n\n          Before imposing an  obstruction of justice  enhancement\r\n\npredicated  on  perjurious  testimony,  a sentencing  court  must\r\n\nsurvey the  trial evidence  to ascertain  whether it  establishes\r\n\nthat  the defendant gave  \"false testimony concerning  a material\r\n\nmatter  with the willful intent to provide false testimony rather\r\n\nthan  as  a result  of  confusion,  mistake, or  faulty  memory.\"\r\n\nUnited States v. Dunnigan,  507 U.S. 87, 94 (1993).   The court's\r                                   \r\n\nfindings need  not be precise  to the  point of pedantry.   While\r\n\nseparate   findings  as  to  each  element  are  preferable,  the\r\n\nsentencing court's  determination is  sustainable so  long as  it\r\n\n\"encompasses all of the factual predicates.\"  Id. at 95.  This is\r                                                           \r\n\nsuch a case.\r\n\n          The  appellant  does  not   challenge  the  materiality\r\n\ncomponent  of the  district court's  determination.   Rather,  he\r\n\nconcentrates  his fire  on  the  finding of  falsity.   He  cites\r\n\nlanguage  that  once  appeared  in  the  Sentencing  Commission's\r\n\ncommentary, USSG  3C1.1,  comment. (n.1) (Nov. 1995)  and earlier\r\n\neditions, to  the  effect  that  in applying  section  3C1.1  \"in\r\n\nrespect  to  alleged   false  testimony  or  statements   by  the\r\n\ndefendant, such testimony or statements should be  evaluated in a\r\n\nlight  most favorable  to  the defendant,\"  and  claims that  the\r\n\nsentencing court  erred by  failing to  consider his  testimonial\r\n\nstatements accordingly.\r\n\n          The  most recent version of the guidelines deleted this\r\n\n                                28\r\r\n\nlanguage,  see USSG  App. C, amend.  566 (Nov. 1997),  but it was\r                        \r\n\nzoetic  at the  time of  the  appellant's sentencing,  and he  is\r\n\ntherefore  entitled  to  its  benefit.    See  United  States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nHarotunian, 920  F.2d 1040, 1041-42  (1st Cir. 1990).   But, this\r                    \r\n\ncircumstance does not profit  McKeeve.  His suggested reading  of\r\n\nthe language would allow \"the  safeguard [to] swallow the rule in\r\n\na  single  gulp,\" Akitoye,  923 F.2d  at  228, and  we  long have\r                                   \r\n\nrejected  it.   In its  heyday the  now-discarded language  never\r\n\nrequired sentencing  courts to resolve all  evidentiary conflicts\r\n\nto the defendant's benefit.  Thus, a sentencing court required to\r\n\napply that language today need only construe allegedly perjurious\r\n\nstatements  in a defendant-favorable  way if such  statements are\r\n\ngenuinely  ambiguous   or  if  the   record,  after   credibility\r\n\ndeterminations have  been made,  plausibly  supports an  innocent\r\n\ninterpretation.  See   United States v.  Clark, 84 F.3d  506, 510\r                                                        \r\n\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 272 (1996).\r                                  \r\n\n           Here, the overwhelming weight of the credible evidence\r\n\ncontradicted the appellant's professions of  ignorance.  Numerous\r\n\nwitnesses testified to incriminating statements and  conduct that\r\n\noccurred before the appellant claims he became aware  of possible\r\n\nlegal  problems.  This evidence  strongly supports a finding that\r\n\nthe  appellant knew all along that  his actions were illegal.  In\r\n\nthese  circumstances, the obsolete language is inapposite and the\r\n\ndistrict court's finding of perjury is unimpugnable.\r\n\n          The supportability of this finding likewise defeats the\r\n\nappellant's related claim that the two-level enhancement punished\r\n\n                                29\r\r\n\nhim for exercising his constitutional right to testify in his own\r\n\ndefense.  That  right, though precious, does not  include a right\r\n\nto commit perjury.  See Dunnigan, 507 U.S. at 96.\r                                          \r\n\nVI.  CONCLUSION\r          VI.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We  need  go  no  further.   To  the  extent  that  the\r\n\nappellant  rolls out other arguments, they are plainly inadequate\r\n\nand do  not warrant  discussion.   The short  of it  is that,  in\r\n\ncolloguing to  sell computer equipment  to Libya, McKeeve  spun a\r\n\ntangled international  web that ultimately ensnared  its creator.\r\n\nFor that conduct, he was  lawfully indicted, fairly tried, justly\r\n\nconvicted, and appropriately sentenced.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                    Affirmed.\r                            \r\n\n                                30\r\r\n",

McKeeve assembles a litany of alleged errors in protest of his conviction and sentence.  His flagship claim requires us to investigate the circumstances under which the Confrontation Clause allows a prosecution witness to testify by foreign deposition over the defendant's objection.  After carefully considering this issue (a matter of first impression in this circuit) and assaying the appellant's other points, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mindful of the appellant's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we limn the facts in the light most flattering to the jury's verdict.  See United States v. Staula, 80 F.3d 596, 599 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 156, 136 L.Ed.2d 101 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant and his business partner, Shelagh McNeil, both citizens of the United Kingdom, operated McNeil International, Ltd.  (MIL), a company organized under the laws of Scotland.  Through it, the pair brokered various export transactions.  In 1994, Peter Sullivan, the owner of Afromed (a Maltese firm), approached the appellant about acquiring a large quantity of computer equipment for the Libyan government.  McKeeve agreed to handle the transaction and began to investigate its logistical aspects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McKeeve contacted the United Kingdom's Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to ascertain whether British authorities would require him to obtain an export license to ship computer equipment from the United Kingdom to Libya.  DTI advised him that he probably needed such a license, and at some point, a DTI official also informed him that most computer equipment shipped to Libya wound up in munitions factories.  Hot on the heels of this contact, Eric Lane, an investigator for British Customs, paid the appellant a visit.  Lane stated that U.S. restrictions on trade with Libya were more stringent than those of the United Kingdom, and advised McKeeve that he should confer with U.S. Customs if he contemplated exporting computer equipment from the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the fall of 1995 the appellant designated a Massachusetts firm, New England Computer Exchange (NEXL), as the vendor of choice to supply the $300,000 worth of computer equipment needed to fill Afromed's order.  When NEXL's representatives (Cliff Rucker and Deepak Jain) learned that the appellant wanted to transship the equipment through Cyprus--a notorious clearinghouse for goods destined for embargoed countries--they expressed concern about the ultimate resting place of the computer equipment.  The appellant prevaricated and told them that the goods were bound for Ethiopia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McKeeve and McNeil proceeded to instruct their stateside shipping agent, Peabody and Lane (P &amp; L), to arrange shipment only as far as Cyprus.  Simultaneously, they directed a British shipping agent, Alex Redpath, to arrange freight forwarding to Libya and, when Redpath warned that the U.S. trading embargo posed potential difficulties, the appellant merely reiterated the instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 12, 1995, the appellant oversaw the packing of the computer equipment at NEXL's warehouse in Reading, Massachusetts.  A trucker delivered the goods, in a shipping container, to port in Charlestown, Massachusetts.  Acting on a tip, the U.S. Customs Service ordered the container held at port.  Because this delay threatened to undercut the letter of credit that Afromed had produced to pay for the goods, the appellant flew to Malta and met with Sullivan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At about the same time, the appellant instructed P &amp; L to discharge the computer equipment in Antwerp, Belgium (a port through which it already was scheduled to pass en route to Cyprus).  When a P &amp; L agent informed McNeil about this change, McNeil advised her to maintain Cyprus as the port of final destination.  The appellant subsequently confirmed McNeil's instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite these machinations, the computer equipment stayed put.  Although it originally was due to depart Charlestown on October 18, it remained on customs hold a full week later.  On October 25, McNeil contacted NEXL's chief executive and stated that if he (Rucker) did not sign the Shipper's Export Declaration (SED), a U.S. Customs export document that lists, among other things, the ultimate destination of the goods, no payment would be forthcoming.  McNeil transmitted an unsigned SED to Rucker that listed \"Cyprus, Greece\" as the port of unloading and Greece as the country of ultimate destination.  Rucker called McNeil to report the apparent discrepancy and McNeil instructed him to delete Greece and insert Ethiopia as the country of ultimate destination.  Rucker made the requested changes, signed the SED, and transmitted a facsimile to McNeil.  Notwithstanding the newly executed SED, the customs hold endured.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 31, the U.S. Customs Service became convinced that the appellant sought surreptitiously to export goods to Libya.  A customs agent, posing as a seaport supervisor, convinced the appellant to return to Boston and address a paperwork snafu that ostensibly prevented vacation of the customs hold.  During a meeting with undercover customs agents, captured on videotape, the appellant vouchsafed that the computer equipment was destined for Ethiopia and signed a false SED.  Shortly thereafter, the authorities arrested him and seized the computer equipment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A federal grand jury indicted the appellant on charges that he knowingly violated the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), 50 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1701-1706 (1994), and its associated Executive Orders and regulations, Exec.  Order No. 12,924, 3 C.F.R. 917 (1994) &amp; Exec.  Order No. 12,543, 3 C.F.R. 181 (1986), both reprinted in 50 U.S.C. &#167; 1701 note;  31 C.F.R. &#167; 550.202 (1997);  15 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 774.1, 785.7(a), 787.3(a), 787.6 (1997);  conspired to violate IEEPA, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371 (1994);  and made false statements to the U.S. Customs Service, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1001 (1994).  The grand jury also indicted McKeeve's and McNeil's corporation, MIL, on several related counts, but did not charge it with participating in the conspiracy.  The bill named McNeil as an unindicted coconspirator, but neither she nor Sullivan was named as a defendant (presumably because they were beyond the court's jurisdiction).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the appellant admitted that Libya always had been the intended destination for the computer equipment.  Nevertheless, he professed that he only belatedly became aware that his actions might violate U.S. law and that, when he learned of the problem, he tried to \"slow down\" the transaction by discharging the equipment in Antwerp for eventual sale in the United Kingdom.  He attempted to explain away his false claim that Ethiopia was the country of ultimate destination as a standard broker's business practice designed to mask his customer's identity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury weighed the evidence, concluded that the appellant knew all along that U.S. law prohibited the transaction, and convicted him on all counts.  The jury also found MIL guilty as charged.  The district court sentenced both defendants, but only McKeeve perfected an appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE FOREIGN DEPOSITION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant objects in this court, as he did below, to admission at trial of the deposition testimony of the British shipping agent, Alex Redpath.  His cardinal contention is that the admission of this evidence abrogated his rights under the Confrontation Clause.  We exercise plenary review over this claim of constitutional error.  See United States v. Stokes, 124 F.3d 39, 42 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>A. Setting the Stage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties--who agree on little else--share the view that Redpath was a key witness.  Initially, the prosecution gained Redpath's assurances that he would travel to the United States and testify at the trial.  As the day of reckoning approached, Redpath experienced a change of heart.  Because the district court lacked subpoena power over Redpath (who lived and worked in Great Britain), the government moved for leave to depose him abroad.  The motion invoked a procedural rule that provides in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>Whenever due to exceptional circumstances of the case it is in the interest of justice that the testimony of a prospective witness of a party be taken and preserved for use at trial, the court may upon motion of such party and notice to the parties order that testimony of such witness be taken by deposition....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Crim.P. 15(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government proposed to mitigate any Confrontation Clause issues by transporting the appellant and his counsel to the site of the deposition and videotaping the proceedings.  This proposal proved problematic for two reasons.  First, the U.S. Marshals Service lacks jurisdiction to retain custody of federal detainees on foreign soil and the Central Authority of the United Kingdom would not agree to assume temporary custody of McKeeve so that he could attend the deposition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Second, British magistrates typically prohibit the videotaping and audiotaping of depositions, and made no exception in this instance.  The district court nonetheless found that Redpath was an unavailable witness and that the interest of justice warranted the deposition.  Working within the spare confines of the British scheme, the court directed the government to transport the appellant's attorney to the deposition and to install two telephone lines--one that would allow the appellant to monitor the deposition from his prison cell and another that would allow him to consult privately with counsel during the deposition.  The court reserved a ruling on the Confrontation Clause objections until the time of trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Redpath's deposition was taken before a British magistrate in the Solihull Magistrates' Court, Birmingham, England.  Lawyers for the government and for both defendants attended and questioned the deponent.  A solicitor (who doubled in brass as the clerk of the Magistrates' Court) contemporaneously prepared a transcript.  The appellant monitored the proceedings by means of a live telephone link.  At the conclusion of the session, the solicitor certified the transcript as accurate and forwarded it to the district court.  When the prosecution subsequently offered the deposition at trial, Judge Keeton overruled the appellant's objections and allowed the government to read it into evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>B. The Legal Landscape.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The use of deposition testimony in criminal trials is disfavored, largely because such evidence tends to diminish a defendant's Sixth Amendment confrontation rights.  See, e.g., United States v. Drogoul, 1 F.3d 1546, 1551 (11th Cir.1993);  United States v. Mann, 590 F.2d 361, 365 (1st Cir.1978).  But the shrinking size of the globe means that certain criminal activities increasingly manifest an international cachet and, because federal courts frequently lack the power to compel a foreign national's attendance at trial, Rule 15 may offer the only practicable means of procuring critical evidence.  The resultant tension between the defendant's Confrontation Clause rights and the prosecution's need to obtain evidence from persons domiciled abroad, while new to this circuit, threatens to become a recurring theme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The various subsections of Rule 15 govern the method and manner by which depositions in criminal cases are to be taken.  The appellant tacitly concedes that the taking of Redpath's deposition did not contravene the rule's formal requirements.  Nevertheless, compliance with Rule 15 is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition to the use of a deposition at trial.  The admissibility of the testimony is quite another matter.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 15(e).  The appellant cloaks himself in the mantle of the Confrontation Clause and makes his stand at this juncture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Confrontation Clause's \"central concern ... is to ensure the reliability of the evidence against a criminal defendant by subjecting it to rigorous testing in the context of an adversary proceeding before the trier of fact.\"  Maryland v. Craig, 497 U.S. 836, 845, 110 S.Ct. 3157, 3163, 111 L.Ed.2d 666 (1990).  The Clause addresses that concern principally by affording a criminal defendant the right to confront appearing witnesses face to face and the right to conduct rigorous cross-examination of those witnesses.  See Coy v. Iowa, 487 U.S. 1012, 1017, 108 S.Ct. 2798, 2801, 101 L.Ed.2d 857 (1988);  Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, 480 U.S. 39, 51, 107 S.Ct. 989, 998, 94 L.Ed.2d 40 (1987);  see also Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56, 63, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 2537-38, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980) (discussing the Confrontation Clause's \"preference for face-to-face confrontation\").  Ordinarily, then, when the government purposes to introduce a deposition at trial in lieu of live testimony, a defendant has the right to be present during the deposition so that he may confront the deponent.  See Christian v. Rhode, 41 F.3d 461, 465 (9th Cir.1994);  Don v. Nix, 886 F.2d 203, 206 (8th Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Withal, we know on the best of authority that the Confrontation Clause cannot be applied mechanically, but, rather, must be interpreted \"in the context of the necessities of trial and the adversary process.\"  Craig, 497 U.S. at 850, 110 S.Ct. at 3166.   In other words, the right of confrontation is not absolute.  Yet, filtering constitutional concerns through a seine woven of practical necessity is a tricky business, and different situations likely will yield different accommodations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the government conducts a Rule 15 deposition in a foreign land with a view toward introducing it at trial, the Confrontation Clause requires, at a minimum, that the government undertake diligent efforts to facilitate the defendant's presence.  See United States v. Kelly, 892 F.2d 255, 262 (3d Cir.1989);  United States v. Salim, 855 F.2d 944, 950 (2d Cir.1988).  We caution, however, that although such efforts must be undertaken in good faith, they need not be heroic, and the possibility of using a deposition does not evaporate even if those efforts prove fruitless.  In that event the district court must determine, on a case-specific basis, whether reasonable alternative measures can preserve adequately the values that underpin the defendant's confrontation rights.  In cases where actions by, or the laws of, a foreign nation effectively preclude the defendant's presence, furnishing the defendant with the capability for live monitoring of the deposition, as well as a separate (private) telephone line for consultation with counsel, usually will satisfy the demands of the Confrontation Clause.  See United States v. Mueller, 74 F.3d 1152, 1156-57 (11th Cir.1996) ;  Kelly, 892 F.2d at 260;  Salim, 855 at 950.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>C. The Appellant's Constitutional Challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the record reveals that the prosecution made reasonable and diligent efforts to secure the appellant's attendance at Redpath's deposition:  it offered to defray the cost of transporting the appellant and his counsel to the deposition and requested that British authorities accept temporary custody of him to ensure his presence.  Only a lack of cooperation by the host nation stymied the appellant's appearance, and the Justice Department was powerless to coerce British assistance.  The appellant points to nothing more that the prosecution plausibly could have done to facilitate a face-to-face confrontation.  What is more, when the British authorities balked, Judge Keeton fashioned a reasonable alternative, and the prosecution provided the requisite telephonic links between the appellant's prison cell and the Solihull Magistrates' Court.  Under the prevailing circumstances, the government's efforts to secure (or, alternatively, to approximate) a face-to-face confrontation were constitutionally adequate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This finding, in itself, does not defeat the appellant's constitutional challenge.  Face-to-face confrontation in a courtroom setting has yet another virtue;  it permits the trier of fact better to observe a witness's demeanor.  See Craig, 497 U.S. at 846, 110 S.Ct. at 3163-64;  Drogoul, 1 F.3d at 1552.   Like the right of confrontation itself, however, this value is not absolute.  Thus, even when a witness is unavailable to testify at trial, the Clause countenances the admission of certain extrajudicial statements as long as they possess sufficient indicia of reliability.  See Roberts, 448 U.S. at 65-66, 100 S.Ct. at 2538-39;  Puleio v. Vose, 830 F.2d 1197, 1205 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For this purpose, \"[r]eliability can be inferred without more in a case where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.\"  Roberts, 448 U.S. at 66, 100 S.Ct. at 2539.   So it is here:  Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(1) limns a hearsay exception for former testimony of an unavailable witness.  This exception's roots are deeply embedded in American jurisprudence.  See, e.g., Mattox v. United States, 156 U.S. 237, 240-44, 15 S.Ct. 337, 338-40, 39 L.Ed. 409 (1895).  Consistent with this tradition, courts seem disinclined to find any Confrontation Clause transgression when the prosecution offers deposition testimony under this rule.  See, e.g., Ecker v. Scott, 69 F.3d 69, 71 (5th Cir.1995);  Kelly, 892 F.2d at 261-62;  Salim, 855 F.2d at 954-55.   We join these courts and hold that evidence properly within the former testimony hearsay exception is, by definition, not vulnerable to a challenge based upon the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To bring Redpath's testimony within the protective embrace of this holding, the government had to make a threshold showing (1) that the witness was unavailable, and (2) that the deposition constituted former testimony.  The appellant contests both points.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard test for unavailability is whether the witness's attendance could be procured \"by process or other reasonable means.\"  Fed.R.Evid. 804(a)(5).  In a criminal context, however, Confrontation Clause concerns color the Rule 804 availability inquiry and heighten the government's burden.  See Ecker, 69 F.3d at 71-72.   Thus, the prosecution must actively attempt to secure the witness's presence at trial.  See Christian, 41 F.3d at 467.   Here, as we noted above, the government made an assiduous effort to convince Redpath to attend the trial.  We fail to discern any further action that the prosecutor reasonably could have taken to bring the witness before the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remaining question is whether Redpath's deposition amounted to \"former testimony\" within the purview of Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(1).  The appellant's objection on this score is a bare assertion that the method of transcribing the proceeding was \"slow and inexact.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  We must balance this complaint against the dominant characteristics of the deposition, namely, the administration of an oath;  unlimited direct and cross-examination by attorneys for all parties;  the ability to lodge objections;  oversight by a judicial officer;  the compilation of the transcript by a trained solicitor;  and the lack of a language barrier.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the deposition did not comport in all respects with American practice, but that circumstance alone does not render the testimony not \"in compliance with law\" and therefore beyond the reach of Rule 804(b)(1).  We agree with the Second Circuit that \"unless the manner of examination required by the law of the host nation is so incompatible with our fundamental principles of fairness or so prone to inaccuracy or bias as to render the testimony inherently unreliable, ... a deposition taken ... in accordance with the law of the host nation is taken 'in compliance with law' for purposes of Rule 804(b)(1).\"  Salim, 855 F.2d at 953.   The British proceeding substantially jibes with our practice and thus satisfies the rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's final plaint is that the Redpath deposition was not videotaped.  History undermines this plaint.  The former testimony exception to the Confrontation Clause predates the development of videotaping technology by nearly a century.  See Mattox, 156 U.S. at 240-44, 15 S.Ct. at 338-40.   Thus, the exception obviously does not envision the need to present the trier of fact with a video recording of the declarant's testimony.  In a case like this one--where the host nation prohibits videotaping--the district court's refusal to condition its authorization of the deposition on the use of such a technique did not offend the Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hasten to add, however, that our opinion should not be read to discourage the use of videotaped depositions in this type of situation.  Having the trier of fact observe the testimonial demeanor of the witness enhances important Confrontation Clause values, including the perception of fairness in criminal trials.  See Craig, 497 U.S. at 846, 110 S.Ct. at 3163-64;  Coy, 487 U.S. at 1018-20, 108 S.Ct. at 2801-03.   For these reasons, although videotaping is not constitutionally required, we urge the district courts, if videotaping is feasible, to give serious consideration to granting defendants' requests to employ the technique.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, the Redpath deposition satisfies the Rule 804(b)(1) standard.  Moreover, the very characteristics which contribute to that conclusion--e.g., administration of an oath;  unlimited direct and cross-examination;  ability to lodge objections;  oversight by a judicial officer;  compilation of the transcript by a trained solicitor;  and linguistic compatibility--also provide sufficient indicia of reliability to assuage any reasonable Confrontation Clause concerns.  See Roberts, 448 U.S. at 66, 100 S.Ct. at 2539;  Salim, 855 F.2d at 954-55.   The district court did not err in admitting the deposition testimony into evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE CONSPIRACY CONVICTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant launches a barrage of nearly unthirlable arguments directed toward his conviction for conspiracy to violate IEEPA.  These arguments land well wide of the mark.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IEEPA codifies Congress's intent to confer broad and flexible power upon the President to impose and enforce economic sanctions against nations that the President deems a threat to national security interests.  See United States v. Arch Trading Co., 987 F.2d 1087, 1093-94 (4th Cir.1993).  Included in the President's IEEPA authority is the right to prohibit persons from engaging in commercial transactions with such hostile foreign nations.  See 50 U.S.C. &#167; 1702(a)(1)(B).  The appellant reads this provision as applying only to persons who are subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.  He then posits that as neither of his supposed accomplices fell within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States when the events at issue transpired--McNeil and Sullivan are domiciliaries of the United Kingdom and Malta, respectively, and neither of them entered the United States during the relevant time frame--they could not in terms violate IEEPA.  A person cannot conspire with himself, the appellant's thesis runs, and to suggest that McNeil and Sullivan were coconspirators in this matter implies that IEEPA's reach extends extraterritorially--a result inconsonant with both the statutory text and the traditional presumption against extraterritoriality.  See United States v. Nippon Paper Indus. Co., 109 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 118 S.Ct. 685, 139 L.Ed.2d 632 (1998).  Based on this reasoning, the appellant concludes that any agreement among McNeil, Sullivan, and himself concerning the exportation of computers to Libya cannot form the basis for a conspiracy conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This theory is both procedurally and substantively infirm.  As a matter of procedure, the theory makes its debut in McKeeve's appellate brief, and \"[i]f any principle is settled in this circuit, it is that, absent the most extraordinary circumstances, legal theories not raised squarely in the lower court cannot be broached for the first time on appeal.\"  Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers Union v. Superline Transp. Co., 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir.1992).  There are no excusatory circumstances here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite this procedural default, we could still, as a matter of discretion, review the argument for plain error.  See United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 972 (1st Cir.1995).  But so detailed a review is unnecessary here, for there is no error, plain or otherwise.  The appellant's theory overlooks a critical component of IEEPA's framework.  Among other things, IEEPA expressly confers on the President the power to prohibit commercial transactions with certain foreign nations \"with respect to any property ... subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\"  50 U.S.C. &#167; 1702(a)(1).  The computer equipment around which the conspiracy centered was stored in Massachusetts and unquestionably subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.  Accordingly, as long as either McNeil or Sullivan knew the locus of the equipment and knew that U.S. law prohibited its export to Libya,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> the ensuing agreement with the appellant had an unlawful design sufficient to animate the federal conspiracy statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at hand, the government adduced ample proof of both propositions.  The record contains abundant evidence that McNeil, at least, was aware of U.S. export restrictions and purposefully sought to evade them.  Of particular note are her successful efforts to coerce Rucker into signing an SED that falsely described the ultimate destination of the goods and her countermanding of the suggestion that the goods be discharged in Antwerp.  In addition, the nisi prius roll shows beyond hope of contradiction that the appellant performed an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy when he purchased the equipment from NEXL in Massachusetts and attempted to ship it to Libya.  McKeeve's purchase supplied the final piece of proof needed to ground a conviction on the conspiracy count.  See Ford v. United States, 273 U.S. 593, 620, 47 S.Ct. 531, 540, 71 L.Ed. 793 (1927) (holding that, when a conspiracy \"was directed to violation of the United States law within the United States by men within and without it, and everything done was at the procuration and by the agency of each for the other in pursuance of the conspiracy ... all are guilty of the offense of conspiring to violate the United States law whether they are in or out of the country\");  United States v. Inco Bank &amp; Trust Corp., 845 F.2d 919, 920 n. 4 (11th Cir.1988) (per curiam) (noting \"that a conspiracy occurring partly within the United States is prosecutable without resort to any theory of extraterritorial jurisdiction\");  Rivera v. United States, 57 F.2d 816, 819 (1st Cir.1932) (\"The place of the conspiracy is immaterial provided an overt act is committed within the jurisdiction of the court.\").  No more is exigible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. OTHER ALLEGED TRIAL ERRORS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant raises a host of issues that relate loosely to his oft-repeated claim that he did not receive a fair trial.  Individually, these issues are insubstantial, and in combination they produce no synergistic effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p>A. Admission of Sullivan's Statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a protest that harks back to his sufficiency challenge, the appellant takes umbrage with the district court's decision to admit, over his objection, evidence of certain out-of-court statements allegedly made by Sullivan to third parties.  The statements, as recounted by Redpath, specifically linked the appellant to Sullivan;  showed that Sullivan acted throughout with a view toward transshipping the computer equipment through Cyprus to Libya;  and undermined the appellant's testimony that his attempt to off-load the equipment in Antwerp was not a ruse, but, rather, a sincere effort to abort the transaction once he became aware that it would violate U.S. law.  We customarily review decisions to admit or exclude evidence for abuse of discretion, see United States v. Houlihan, 92 F.3d 1271, 1296 (1st Cir.1996), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 963, 136 L.Ed.2d 849 (1997), and we follow that praxis here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court admitted the challenged evidence on the authority of Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), which creates an exception to the hearsay rule for extrajudicial statements \"by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\"   The appellant's principal objection to the court's action stems from his extraterritoriality argument.  We previously rejected that argument, see supra Part III, and the theory that undergirds it fares no better in an evidentiary context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second prong of the appellant's objection suggests that the government did not adduce sufficient evidence of Sullivan's involvement to bring his statements within the reach of Rule 801(d)(2)(E).  This prong rests on an impeccable legal foundation.  An out-of-court statement of a non-testifying coconspirator is admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(E) only if the district court supportably finds that \"it is more likely than not that the declarant and the defendant were members of the conspiracy when the hearsay statement was made, and that the statement was in furtherance of the conspiracy.\"  United States v. Petrozziello, 548 F.2d 20, 23 (1st Cir.1977);  accord United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 715 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Factually, however, the objection falls flat.  The government showed that Sullivan headed Afromed;  that his name appeared on numerous documents created pursuant to the transaction;  that he was in constant contact with the appellant regarding the status of the project (including the customs hold);  and that he was responsible for arranging transshipment of the goods to the Libyan purchaser.  The record also shows that, while in the United States, the appellant sent Sullivan a memo that advised Sullivan to use extreme caution in contacting him and to be very careful what he said in any such communication.  In light of this evidentiary predicate, the district court had a reasonable basis for concluding that, more likely than not, McKeeve and Sullivan were coconspirators and that Sullivan's comments to Redpath were made during and in furtherance of the conspiracy.  Consequently, the decision to admit Sullivan's hearsay statements under the coconspirator exception did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p>B. Admission of Lane's Testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During trial, Eric Lane, a British customs official, testified that the appellant spoke to him anent DTI's earlier warning that virtually all computers sent to Libya ended up in arms factories.  The appellant objected to this testimony on relevancy grounds and added that, to the extent the testimony might otherwise be admissible, it was unduly prejudicial.  He argued then, and reasserts now, that since U.S. law bans the export of any product (except certain humanitarian aid) to any Libyan entity, the fact that a DTI official had warned him that computer shipments would be used to outfit Libyan arms factories is irrelevant to any crime charged in the indictment.  For its part, the government points to the appellant's admission that he knew all along that the U.S. embargo at least paralleled United Nations sanctions (which explicitly prohibit the sale of equipment destined for Libyan military applications), and that, in light of this admission, Lane's testimony tended to undercut the appellant's claim that he did not realize the Afromed transaction transgressed U.S. law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court accepted the government's position, but told the jury that it could consider the proffered testimony only with regard to McKeeve's state of mind (i.e., whether he plotted to contravene the Libyan embargo in knowing violation of IEEPA) and not for the truth of the matter asserted.  We review this decision for abuse of discretion.  See Houlihan, 92 F.3d at 1297.   We detect no abuse either in the trial court's decision to admit Lane's testimony as probative of McKeeve's state of mind or in its refusal to exclude the proffer under Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevancy objection requires scant comment.  Fed.R.Evid. 401 deems relevant evidence that has \"any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\"   The instant indictment charged the appellant with knowingly and willfully violating, and conspiring to violate, IEEPA.  His state of mind, assessable only by indirect proof, see United States v. St. Michael's Credit Union, 880 F.2d 579, 600 (1st Cir.1989), was of critical importance to the resolution of these charges.  When, as now, the prosecution offers evidence bearing on an inherently subjective inquiry, the relevancy threshold is at its lowest.  See United States v. Tierney, 760 F.2d 382, 387 (1st Cir.1985).  Seen in this light, Judge Keeton reasonably could conclude--as, indeed, he did--that McKeeve's knowledge of the likely end use of the computer equipment tended to make less probable his state-of-mind defense.  Hence, the judge did not err in admitting the statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rule 403 objection is similarly unavailing.  That rule directs a trial court to exclude relevant evidence if, inter alia, \"its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\"   But almost all evidence is meant to be prejudicial--why else would a party seek to introduce it?--and it is only unfairly prejudicial evidence that must be banished.  See United States v. Rodriguez-Estrada, 877 F.2d 153, 156 (1st Cir.1989).  Although the Lane testimony may have prejudiced the appellant in the sense that it fit, tongue and groove, into the prosecution's theory of the case, there is nothing unfair about the jury's weighing of it for the limited purpose of determining the appellant's state of mind.  For this reason, we decline the appellant's invitation to second-guess the district judge's evidentiary gravimetry.  See Freeman v. Package Mach. Co., 865 F.2d 1331, 1340 (1st Cir.1988) (\"Only rarely--and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances--will we, from the vista of a cold appellate record, reverse a district court's on-the-spot judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p>C. Admission of Harmon's Testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant also cries foul in respect to a statement made at trial by David Harmon, a Treasury Department official, to the effect that the U.S. embargo against Libya resulted from a presidential determination that Libya supports international terrorism.  Because the appellant did not lodge a contemporaneous objection to this testimony, we ordinarily would review his belated challenge for plain error.  See United States v. Griffin, 818 F.2d 97, 99-100 (1st Cir.1987).  Here, however, the circumstances obviate any need to engage in plain error review.  See United States v. Castro-Lara, 970 F.2d 976, 981 n. 5 (1st Cir.1992) (explaining that, if no error inheres, plain error review becomes a superfluous step).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government called Harmon to establish the existence and effect of the economic sanctions imposed against Libya.  Harmon's description of the purpose behind the embargo provided the jury with relevant background information that helped to stitch together an appropriate context in which the jury could assess the evidence introduced during the trial.  Admitting Harmon's statement was well within the realm of the district court's discretion.  See, e.g., Castro-Lara, 970 F.2d at 981;  United States v. Daly, 842 F.2d 1380, 1388 (2d Cir.1988).  Trials are meaty affairs, and appellate courts should not insist that all taste be extracted from a piece of evidence before a jury can chew on it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p>D. Prosecutorial Misconduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's next assignment of error is predicated on a claim that the prosecutor overstepped her bounds during opening and closing arguments.  This claim is a superscription that grows out of the prosecutor's references to Lane's testimony in her opening statement and to Harmon's testimony in her summation.  Because the prosecutor, on each occasion, did no more than describe accurately testimony that the jury would hear or already had heard, the assignment of error fails.  At least in the absence of highly exceptional circumstances (not present here), a comment by counsel in the course of jury summation that merely recounts properly admitted testimony, accurately and without embellishment or distortion, cannot constitute reversible error.  See Jentges v. Milwaukee County Circuit Court, 733 F.2d 1238, 1242 (7th Cir.1984).  So, too, a comment in the course of an opening statement that merely presages subsequently admitted testimony cannot constitute reversible error.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. SENTENCING</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court sentenced the appellant to a prison term of 51 months, the low end of the applicable guideline sentencing range (offense level 24;  criminal history category I).  Salvaging scant succor from this fact, the appellant strives to persuade us that the court made two material errors in its sentencing calculations.  We are unconvinced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p>A. Evasion of National Security Controls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to export control offenses, the sentencing guidelines provide for a base offense level (BOL) of 14 unless \"national security or nuclear proliferation controls were evaded,\" in which case the BOL escalates to 22.  USSG &#167; 2M5.1(a).  The lower court found that the offense of conviction qualified for the eight-level enhancement.  The appellant claims that this ruling is based on an erroneous reading of the enhancement provision.  Because this claim implicates the meaning and scope of the guideline, our review is plenary.  See United States v. Muniz, 49 F.3d 36, 41 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's core contention is that USSG &#167; 2M5.1(a)(1) cannot apply in a sale-of-goods case unless the government presents evidence that the particular goods, when or if sold, constitute an actual threat to national security.  We disagree.  In Executive Order No. 12,543, the President determined that Libya posed an \"unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States\" and therefore ordered an embargo covering the exportation of virtually all goods to Libya.  The embargo is an exercise of executive power authorized by IEEPA \"to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat ... to the national security.\"  50 U.S.C. &#167; 1701.  In short, the embargo is intended as a national security control.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends the matter.  As we read it, section 2M5.1(a)(1) applies to any offense that involves a shipment (or proposed shipment) that offends the embargo, whether or not the goods shipped actually are intended for some innocent use.  See United States v. Shetterly, 971 F.2d 67, 76 (7th Cir.1992).  The appellant's argument to the contrary seeks to substitute the judgment of a factfinder for that of the executive branch, which has made a determination that the export of any goods to Libya, excepting only certain humanitarian aid, threatens national security interests.  Such a course is fraught with separation-of-powers perils, see Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527, 108 S.Ct. 818, 823-24, 98 L.Ed.2d 918 (1988) (noting the primacy of presidential power to protect national security interests), and we eschew it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p>B. Obstruction of Justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's remaining complaint is equally unavailing.  At the disposition hearing, the district court increased the appellant's BOL for obstruction of justice.  See USSG &#167; 3C1.1.  The court based this two-level enhancement on a finding that McKeeve committed perjury when he testified that he did not know his actions violated U.S. law.  We review a sentencing court's factbound finding of perjury for clear error.  See United States v. Akitoye, 923 F.2d 221, 229 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before imposing an obstruction of justice enhancement predicated on perjurious testimony, a sentencing court must survey the trial evidence to ascertain whether it establishes that the defendant gave \"false testimony concerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide false testimony rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory.\"  United States v. Dunnigan, 507 U.S. 87, 94, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 1116, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993).  The court's findings need not be precise to the point of pedantry.  While separate findings as to each element are preferable, the sentencing court's determination is sustainable so long as it \"encompasses all of the factual predicates.\"  Id. at 95, 113 S.Ct. at 1117.   This is such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant does not challenge the materiality component of the district court's determination.  Rather, he concentrates his fire on the finding of falsity.  He cites language that once appeared in the Sentencing Commission's commentary, USSG &#167; 3C1.1, comment.  (n.1) (Nov. 1995) and earlier editions, to the effect that in applying section 3C1.1 \"in respect to alleged false testimony or statements by the defendant, such testimony or statements should be evaluated in a light most favorable to the defendant,\" and claims that the sentencing court erred by failing to consider his testimonial statements accordingly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most recent version of the guidelines deleted this language, see USSG App.  C, amend.  566 (Nov.1997), but it was zoetic at the time of the appellant's sentencing, and he is therefore entitled to its benefit.  See United States v. Harotunian, 920 F.2d 1040, 1041-42 (1st Cir.1990).  But, this circumstance does not profit McKeeve.  His suggested reading of the language would allow \"the safeguard [to] swallow the rule in a single gulp,\" Akitoye, 923 F.2d at 228, and we long have rejected it.  In its heyday the now-discarded language never required sentencing courts to resolve all evidentiary conflicts to the defendant's benefit.  Thus, a sentencing court required to apply that language today need only construe allegedly perjurious statements in a defendant-favorable way if such statements are genuinely ambiguous or if the record, after credibility determinations have been made, plausibly supports an innocent interpretation.  See United States v. Clark, 84 F.3d 506, 510 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 272, 136 L.Ed.2d 195 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the overwhelming weight of the credible evidence contradicted the appellant's professions of ignorance.  Numerous witnesses testified to incriminating statements and conduct that occurred before the appellant claims he became aware of possible legal problems.  This evidence strongly supports a finding that the appellant knew all along that his actions were illegal.  In these circumstances, the obsolete language is inapposite and the district court's finding of perjury is unimpugnable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The supportability of this finding likewise defeats the appellant's related claim that the two-level enhancement punished him for exercising his constitutional right to testify in his own defense.  That right, though precious, does not include a right to commit perjury.  See Dunnigan, 507 U.S. at 96, 113 S.Ct. at 1117-18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  To the extent that the appellant rolls out other arguments, they are plainly inadequate and do not warrant discussion.  The short of it is that, in colloguing to sell computer equipment to Libya, McKeeve spun a tangled international web that ultimately ensnared its creator.  For that conduct, he was lawfully indicted, fairly tried, justly convicted, and appropriately sentenced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The appellant asserts that the government did not make a bona fide effort to facilitate his attendance at Redpath's deposition.  The record, which includes the correspondence between the two governments, refutes this assertion</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The appellant offers no convincing examples of any inexactitude.  His only supporting datum is an unamplified statement by counsel for MIL, as follows:  \"There is one particular phrase that has--that is a crucial question that I remember going in as a different question.\"   The specific question and answer never have been identified</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> To support the conviction, the government only needed to prove that the appellant conspired with one other person.

The government never alleged that MIL was a coconspirator, so our choice is limited to McNeil or Sullivan</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

McKeeve assembles a litany of alleged errors in protest of his conviction and sentence.  His flagship claim requires us to investigate the circumstances under which the Confrontation Clause allows a prosecution witness to testify by foreign deposition over the defendant's objection.  After carefully considering this issue (a matter of first impression in this circuit) and assaying the appellant's other points, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mindful of the appellant's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we limn the facts in the light most flattering to the jury's verdict.  See United States v. Staula, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196665\"><a href=\"/opinion/196665/united-states-v-staula/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">596</span></a></span>, 599 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></span> (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant and his business partner, Shelagh McNeil, both citizens of the United Kingdom, operated McNeil International, Ltd.  (MIL), a company organized under the laws of Scotland.  Through it, the pair brokered various export transactions.  In 1994, Peter Sullivan, the owner of Afromed (a Maltese firm), approached the appellant about acquiring a large quantity of computer equipment for the Libyan government.  McKeeve agreed to handle the transaction and began to investigate its logistical aspects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McKeeve contacted the United Kingdom's Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to ascertain whether British authorities would require him to obtain an export license to ship computer equipment from the United Kingdom to Libya.  DTI advised him that he probably needed such a license, and at some point, a DTI official also informed him that most computer equipment shipped to Libya wound up in munitions factories.  Hot on the heels of this contact, Eric Lane, an investigator for British Customs, paid the appellant a visit.  Lane stated that U.S. restrictions on trade with Libya were more stringent than those of the United Kingdom, and advised McKeeve that he should confer with U.S. Customs if he contemplated exporting computer equipment from the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the fall of 1995 the appellant designated a Massachusetts firm, New England Computer Exchange (NEXL), as the vendor of choice to supply the $300,000 worth of computer equipment needed to fill Afromed's order.  When NEXL's representatives (Cliff Rucker and Deepak Jain) learned that the appellant wanted to transship the equipment through Cyprus--a notorious clearinghouse for goods destined for embargoed countries--they expressed concern about the ultimate resting place of the computer equipment.  The appellant prevaricated and told them that the goods were bound for Ethiopia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McKeeve and McNeil proceeded to instruct their stateside shipping agent, Peabody and Lane (P &amp; L), to arrange shipment only as far as Cyprus.  Simultaneously, they directed a British shipping agent, Alex Redpath, to arrange freight forwarding to Libya and, when Redpath warned that the U.S. trading embargo posed potential difficulties, the appellant merely reiterated the instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 12, 1995, the appellant oversaw the packing of the computer equipment at NEXL's warehouse in Reading, Massachusetts.  A trucker delivered the goods, in a shipping container, to port in Charlestown, Massachusetts.  Acting on a tip, the U.S. Customs Service ordered the container held at port.  Because this delay threatened to undercut the letter of credit that Afromed had produced to pay for the goods, the appellant flew to Malta and met with Sullivan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At about the same time, the appellant instructed P &amp; L to discharge the computer equipment in Antwerp, Belgium (a port through which it already was scheduled to pass en route to Cyprus).  When a P &amp; L agent informed McNeil about this change, McNeil advised her to maintain Cyprus as the port of final destination.  The appellant subsequently confirmed McNeil's instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite these machinations, the computer equipment stayed put.  Although it originally was due to depart Charlestown on October 18, it remained on customs hold a full week later.  On October 25, McNeil contacted NEXL's chief executive and stated that if he (Rucker) did not sign the Shipper's Export Declaration (SED), a U.S. Customs export document that lists, among other things, the ultimate destination of the goods, no payment would be forthcoming.  McNeil transmitted an unsigned SED to Rucker that listed \"Cyprus, Greece\" as the port of unloading and Greece as the country of ultimate destination.  Rucker called McNeil to report the apparent discrepancy and McNeil instructed him to delete Greece and insert Ethiopia as the country of ultimate destination.  Rucker made the requested changes, signed the SED, and transmitted a facsimile to McNeil.  Notwithstanding the newly executed SED, the customs hold endured.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 31, the U.S. Customs Service became convinced that the appellant sought surreptitiously to export goods to Libya.  A customs agent, posing as a seaport supervisor, convinced the appellant to return to Boston and address a paperwork snafu that ostensibly prevented vacation of the customs hold.  During a meeting with undercover customs agents, captured on videotape, the appellant vouchsafed that the computer equipment was destined for Ethiopia and signed a false SED.  Shortly thereafter, the authorities arrested him and seized the computer equipment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A federal grand jury indicted the appellant on charges that he knowingly violated the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), 50 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1701-1706 (1994), and its associated Executive Orders and regulations, Exec.  Order No. 12,924, 3 C.F.R. 917 (1994) &amp; Exec.  Order No. 12,543, 3 C.F.R. 181 (1986), both reprinted in 50 U.S.C. &#167; 1701 note;  31 C.F.R. &#167; 550.202 (1997);  15 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 774.1, 785.7(a), 787.3(a), 787.6 (1997);  conspired to violate IEEPA, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371 (1994);  and made false statements to the U.S. Customs Service, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1001 (1994).  The grand jury also indicted McKeeve's and McNeil's corporation, MIL, on several related counts, but did not charge it with participating in the conspiracy.  The bill named McNeil as an unindicted coconspirator, but neither she nor Sullivan was named as a defendant (presumably because they were beyond the court's jurisdiction).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the appellant admitted that Libya always had been the intended destination for the computer equipment.  Nevertheless, he professed that he only belatedly became aware that his actions might violate U.S. law and that, when he learned of the problem, he tried to \"slow down\" the transaction by discharging the equipment in Antwerp for eventual sale in the United Kingdom.  He attempted to explain away his false claim that Ethiopia was the country of ultimate destination as a standard broker's business practice designed to mask his customer's identity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury weighed the evidence, concluded that the appellant knew all along that U.S. law prohibited the transaction, and convicted him on all counts.  The jury also found MIL guilty as charged.  The district court sentenced both defendants, but only McKeeve perfected an appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE FOREIGN DEPOSITION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant objects in this court, as he did below, to admission at trial of the deposition testimony of the British shipping agent, Alex Redpath.  His cardinal contention is that the admission of this evidence abrogated his rights under the Confrontation Clause.  We exercise plenary review over this claim of constitutional error.  See United States v. Stokes, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197523\"><a href=\"/opinion/197523/united-states-v-stokes/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span>, 42 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>A. Setting the Stage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties--who agree on little else--share the view that Redpath was a key witness.  Initially, the prosecution gained Redpath's assurances that he would travel to the United States and testify at the trial.  As the day of reckoning approached, Redpath experienced a change of heart.  Because the district court lacked subpoena power over Redpath (who lived and worked in Great Britain), the government moved for leave to depose him abroad.  The motion invoked a procedural rule that provides in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>Whenever due to exceptional circumstances of the case it is in the interest of justice that the testimony of a prospective witness of a party be taken and preserved for use at trial, the court may upon motion of such party and notice to the parties order that testimony of such witness be taken by deposition....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Crim.P. 15(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government proposed to mitigate any Confrontation Clause issues by transporting the appellant and his counsel to the site of the deposition and videotaping the proceedings.  This proposal proved problematic for two reasons.  First, the U.S. Marshals Service lacks jurisdiction to retain custody of federal detainees on foreign soil and the Central Authority of the United Kingdom would not agree to assume temporary custody of McKeeve so that he could attend the deposition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Second, British magistrates typically prohibit the videotaping and audiotaping of depositions, and made no exception in this instance.  The district court nonetheless found that Redpath was an unavailable witness and that the interest of justice warranted the deposition.  Working within the spare confines of the British scheme, the court directed the government to transport the appellant's attorney to the deposition and to install two telephone lines--one that would allow the appellant to monitor the deposition from his prison cell and another that would allow him to consult privately with counsel during the deposition.  The court reserved a ruling on the Confrontation Clause objections until the time of trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Redpath's deposition was taken before a British magistrate in the Solihull Magistrates' Court, Birmingham, England.  Lawyers for the government and for both defendants attended and questioned the deponent.  A solicitor (who doubled in brass as the clerk of the Magistrates' Court) contemporaneously prepared a transcript.  The appellant monitored the proceedings by means of a live telephone link.  At the conclusion of the session, the solicitor certified the transcript as accurate and forwarded it to the district court.  When the prosecution subsequently offered the deposition at trial, Judge Keeton overruled the appellant's objections and allowed the government to read it into evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>B. The Legal Landscape.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The use of deposition testimony in criminal trials is disfavored, largely because such evidence tends to diminish a defendant's Sixth Amendment confrontation rights.  See, e.g., United States v. Drogoul, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"628057\"><a href=\"/opinion/628057/united-states-v-christopher-p-drogoul/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1546</span></a></span>, 1551 (11th Cir.1993);  United States v. Mann, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"362766\"><a href=\"/opinion/362766/united-states-v-rony-mann/\"><span class=\"volume\">590</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">361</span></a></span>, 365 (1st Cir.1978).  But the shrinking size of the globe means that certain criminal activities increasingly manifest an international cachet and, because federal courts frequently lack the power to compel a foreign national's attendance at trial, Rule 15 may offer the only practicable means of procuring critical evidence.  The resultant tension between the defendant's Confrontation Clause rights and the prosecution's need to obtain evidence from persons domiciled abroad, while new to this circuit, threatens to become a recurring theme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The various subsections of Rule 15 govern the method and manner by which depositions in criminal cases are to be taken.  The appellant tacitly concedes that the taking of Redpath's deposition did not contravene the rule's formal requirements.  Nevertheless, compliance with Rule 15 is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition to the use of a deposition at trial.  The admissibility of the testimony is quite another matter.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 15(e).  The appellant cloaks himself in the mantle of the Confrontation Clause and makes his stand at this juncture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Confrontation Clause's \"central concern ... is to ensure the reliability of the evidence against a criminal defendant by subjecting it to rigorous testing in the context of an adversary proceeding before the trier of fact.\"  Maryland v. Craig, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112489\"><a href=\"/opinion/112489/maryland-v-craig/\"><span class=\"volume\">497</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">836</span></a></span>, 845, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112489\"><a href=\"/opinion/112489/maryland-v-craig/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">666</span></a></span> (1990).  The Clause addresses that concern principally by affording a criminal defendant the right to confront appearing witnesses face to face and the right to conduct rigorous cross-examination of those witnesses.

Ordinarily, then, when the government purposes to introduce a deposition at trial in lieu of live testimony, a defendant has the right to be present during the deposition so that he may confront the deponent.  See Christian v. Rhode, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"683214\"><a href=\"/opinion/683214/stephen-christian-aka-stephen-cline-v-william-rhode/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span>, 465 (9th Cir.1994);  Don v.

In other words, the right of confrontation is not absolute.  Yet, filtering constitutional concerns through a seine woven of practical necessity is a tricky business, and different situations likely will yield different accommodations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the government conducts a Rule 15 deposition in a foreign land with a view toward introducing it at trial, the Confrontation Clause requires, at a minimum, that the government undertake diligent efforts to facilitate the defendant's presence.  See United States v. Kelly, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"534199\"><a href=\"/opinion/534199/united-states-v-joseph-kelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">892</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">255</span></a></span>, 262 (3d Cir.1989);  United States v.

We caution, however, that although such efforts must be undertaken in good faith, they need not be heroic, and the possibility of using a deposition does not evaporate even if those efforts prove fruitless.  In that event the district court must determine, on a case-specific basis, whether reasonable alternative measures can preserve adequately the values that underpin the defendant's confrontation rights.  In cases where actions by, or the laws of, a foreign nation effectively preclude the defendant's presence, furnishing the defendant with the capability for live monitoring of the deposition, as well as a separate (private) telephone line for consultation with counsel, usually will satisfy the demands of the Confrontation Clause.  See United States v. Mueller, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"70708\"><a href=\"/opinion/70708/united-states-v-mueller/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1152</span></a></span>, 1156-57 (11th Cir.1996) ;  Kelly, 892 F.2d at 260;  Salim, 855 at 950.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>C. The Appellant's Constitutional Challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the record reveals that the prosecution made reasonable and diligent efforts to secure the appellant's attendance at Redpath's deposition:  it offered to defray the cost of transporting the appellant and his counsel to the deposition and requested that British authorities accept temporary custody of him to ensure his presence.  Only a lack of cooperation by the host nation stymied the appellant's appearance, and the Justice Department was powerless to coerce British assistance.  The appellant points to nothing more that the prosecution plausibly could have done to facilitate a face-to-face confrontation.  What is more, when the British authorities balked, Judge Keeton fashioned a reasonable alternative, and the prosecution provided the requisite telephonic links between the appellant's prison cell and the Solihull Magistrates' Court.  Under the prevailing circumstances, the government's efforts to secure (or, alternatively, to approximate) a face-to-face confrontation were constitutionally adequate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This finding, in itself, does not defeat the appellant's constitutional challenge.  Face-to-face confrontation in a courtroom setting has yet another virtue;  it permits the trier of fact better to observe a witness's demeanor.  See Craig, 497 U.S. at 846, 110 S.Ct. at 3163-64;  Drogoul, 1 F.3d at 1552.   Like the right of confrontation itself, however, this value is not absolute.  Thus, even when a witness is unavailable to testify at trial, the Clause countenances the admission of certain extrajudicial statements as long as they possess sufficient indicia of reliability.  See Roberts, 448 U.S. at 65-66, 100 S.Ct. at 2538-39;  Puleio v. Vose, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"495428\"><a href=\"/opinion/495428/joseph-a-puleio-v-george-a-vose-jr-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">830</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1197</span></a></span>, 1205 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For this purpose, \"[r]eliability can be inferred without more in a case where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.\"  Roberts, 448 U.S. at 66, 100 S.Ct. at 2539.   So it is here:  Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(1) limns a hearsay exception for former testimony of an unavailable witness.  This exception's roots are deeply embedded in American jurisprudence.  See, e.g., Mattox v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94091\"><a href=\"/opinion/94091/mattox-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">237</span></a></span>, 240-44, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94091\"><a href=\"/opinion/94091/mattox-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></a></span> (1895).  Consistent with this tradition, courts seem disinclined to find any Confrontation Clause transgression when the prosecution offers deposition testimony under this rule.  See, e.g., Ecker v. Scott, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"8112\"><a href=\"/opinion/8112/ecker-v-morales/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span>, 71 (5th Cir.1995);  Kelly, 892 F.2d at 261-62;  Salim, 855 F.2d at 954-55.   We join these courts and hold that evidence properly within the former testimony hearsay exception is, by definition, not vulnerable to a challenge based upon the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To bring Redpath's testimony within the protective embrace of this holding, the government had to make a threshold showing (1) that the witness was unavailable, and (2) that the deposition constituted former testimony.  The appellant contests both points.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard test for unavailability is whether the witness's attendance could be procured \"by process or other reasonable means.\"  Fed.R.Evid. 804(a)(5).  In a criminal context, however, Confrontation Clause concerns color the Rule 804 availability inquiry and heighten the government's burden.  See Ecker, 69 F.3d at 71-72.   Thus, the prosecution must actively attempt to secure the witness's presence at trial.  See Christian, 41 F.3d at 467.   Here, as we noted above, the government made an assiduous effort to convince Redpath to attend the trial.  We fail to discern any further action that the prosecutor reasonably could have taken to bring the witness before the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remaining question is whether Redpath's deposition amounted to \"former testimony\" within the purview of Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(1).  The appellant's objection on this score is a bare assertion that the method of transcribing the proceeding was \"slow and inexact.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  We must balance this complaint against the dominant characteristics of the deposition, namely, the administration of an oath;  unlimited direct and cross-examination by attorneys for all parties;  the ability to lodge objections;  oversight by a judicial officer;  the compilation of the transcript by a trained solicitor;  and the lack of a language barrier.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the deposition did not comport in all respects with American practice, but that circumstance alone does not render the testimony not \"in compliance with law\" and therefore beyond the reach of Rule 804(b)(1).  We agree with the Second Circuit that \"unless the manner of examination required by the law of the host nation is so incompatible with our fundamental principles of fairness or so prone to inaccuracy or bias as to render the testimony inherently unreliable, ... a deposition taken ... in accordance with the law of the host nation is taken 'in compliance with law' for purposes of Rule 804(b)(1).\"  Salim, 855 F.2d at 953.   The British proceeding substantially jibes with our practice and thus satisfies the rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's final plaint is that the Redpath deposition was not videotaped.  History undermines this plaint.  The former testimony exception to the Confrontation Clause predates the development of videotaping technology by nearly a century.  See Mattox, 156 U.S. at 240-44, 15 S.Ct. at 338-40.   Thus, the exception obviously does not envision the need to present the trier of fact with a video recording of the declarant's testimony.  In a case like this one--where the host nation prohibits videotaping--the district court's refusal to condition its authorization of the deposition on the use of such a technique did not offend the Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hasten to add, however, that our opinion should not be read to discourage the use of videotaped depositions in this type of situation.  Having the trier of fact observe the testimonial demeanor of the witness enhances important Confrontation Clause values, including the perception of fairness in criminal trials.  See Craig, 497 U.S. at 846, 110 S.Ct. at 3163-64;  Coy, 487 U.S. at 1018-20, 108 S.Ct. at 2801-03.   For these reasons, although videotaping is not constitutionally required, we urge the district courts, if videotaping is feasible, to give serious consideration to granting defendants' requests to employ the technique.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, the Redpath deposition satisfies the Rule 804(b)(1) standard.  Moreover, the very characteristics which contribute to that conclusion--e.g., administration of an oath;  unlimited direct and cross-examination;  ability to lodge objections;  oversight by a judicial officer;  compilation of the transcript by a trained solicitor;  and linguistic compatibility--also provide sufficient indicia of reliability to assuage any reasonable Confrontation Clause concerns.  See Roberts, 448 U.S. at 66, 100 S.Ct. at 2539;  Salim, 855 F.2d at 954-55.   The district court did not err in admitting the deposition testimony into evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE CONSPIRACY CONVICTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant launches a barrage of nearly unthirlable arguments directed toward his conviction for conspiracy to violate IEEPA.  These arguments land well wide of the mark.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IEEPA codifies Congress's intent to confer broad and flexible power upon the President to impose and enforce economic sanctions against nations that the President deems a threat to national security interests.  See United States v. Arch Trading Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601808\"><a href=\"/opinion/601808/united-states-v-arch-trading-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1087</span></a></span>, 1093-94 (4th Cir.1993).  Included in the President's IEEPA authority is the right to prohibit persons from engaging in commercial transactions with such hostile foreign nations.  See 50 U.S.C. &#167; 1702(a)(1)(B).  The appellant reads this provision as applying only to persons who are subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.  He then posits that as neither of his supposed accomplices fell within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States when the events at issue transpired--McNeil and Sullivan are domiciliaries of the United Kingdom and Malta, respectively, and neither of them entered the United States during the relevant time frame--they could not in terms violate IEEPA.  A person cannot conspire with himself, the appellant's thesis runs, and to suggest that McNeil and Sullivan were coconspirators in this matter implies that IEEPA's reach extends extraterritorially--a result inconsonant with both the statutory text and the traditional presumption against extraterritoriality.  See United States v. Nippon Paper Indus. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"738221\"><a href=\"/opinion/738221/united-states-v-nippon-paper-industries-co-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">632</span></span> (1998).  Based on this reasoning, the appellant concludes that any agreement among McNeil, Sullivan, and himself concerning the exportation of computers to Libya cannot form the basis for a conspiracy conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This theory is both procedurally and substantively infirm.  As a matter of procedure, the theory makes its debut in McKeeve's appellate brief, and \"[i]f any principle is settled in this circuit, it is that, absent the most extraordinary circumstances, legal theories not raised squarely in the lower court cannot be broached for the first time on appeal.\"  Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers Union v. Superline Transp. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"575211\"><a href=\"/opinion/575211/teamsters-chauffeurs-warehousemen-and-helpers-union-local-no-59-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir.1992).  There are no excusatory circumstances here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite this procedural default, we could still, as a matter of discretion, review the argument for plain error.  See United States v. Taylor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196070\"><a href=\"/opinion/196070/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>, 972 (1st Cir.1995).  But so detailed a review is unnecessary here, for there is no error, plain or otherwise.  The appellant's theory overlooks a critical component of IEEPA's framework.  Among other things, IEEPA expressly confers on the President the power to prohibit commercial transactions with certain foreign nations \"with respect to any property ... subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\"  50 U.S.C. &#167; 1702(a)(1).  The computer equipment around which the conspiracy centered was stored in Massachusetts and unquestionably subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.  Accordingly, as long as either McNeil or Sullivan knew the locus of the equipment and knew that U.S. law prohibited its export to Libya,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> the ensuing agreement with the appellant had an unlawful design sufficient to animate the federal conspiracy statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at hand, the government adduced ample proof of both propositions.  The record contains abundant evidence that McNeil, at least, was aware of U.S. export restrictions and purposefully sought to evade them.  Of particular note are her successful efforts to coerce Rucker into signing an SED that falsely described the ultimate destination of the goods and her countermanding of the suggestion that the goods be discharged in Antwerp.  In addition, the nisi prius roll shows beyond hope of contradiction that the appellant performed an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy when he purchased the equipment from NEXL in Massachusetts and attempted to ship it to Libya.  McKeeve's purchase supplied the final piece of proof needed to ground a conviction on the conspiracy count.  See Ford v. United States, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">593</span></span>, 620, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

OTHER ALLEGED TRIAL ERRORS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant raises a host of issues that relate loosely to his oft-repeated claim that he did not receive a fair trial.

The statements, as recounted by Redpath, specifically linked the appellant to Sullivan;  showed that Sullivan acted throughout with a view toward transshipping the computer equipment through Cyprus to Libya;  and undermined the appellant's testimony that his attempt to off-load the equipment in Antwerp was not a ruse, but, rather, a sincere effort to abort the transaction once he became aware that it would violate U.S. law.  We customarily review decisions to admit or exclude evidence for abuse of discretion, see United States v. Houlihan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196936\"><a href=\"/opinion/196936/united-states-v-houlihan/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1271</span></a></span>, 1296 (1st Cir.1996), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We previously rejected that argument, see supra Part III, and the theory that undergirds it fares no better in an evidentiary context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second prong of the appellant's objection suggests that the government did not adduce sufficient evidence of Sullivan's involvement to bring his statements within the reach of Rule 801(d)(2)(E).  This prong rests on an impeccable legal foundation.  An out-of-court statement of a non-testifying coconspirator is admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(E) only if the district court supportably finds that \"it is more likely than not that the declarant and the defendant were members of the conspiracy when the hearsay statement was made, and that the statement was in furtherance of the conspiracy.\"  United States v.

The government showed that Sullivan headed Afromed;  that his name appeared on numerous documents created pursuant to the transaction;  that he was in constant contact with the appellant regarding the status of the project (including the customs hold);  and that he was responsible for arranging transshipment of the goods to the Libyan purchaser.  The record also shows that, while in the United States, the appellant sent Sullivan a memo that advised Sullivan to use extreme caution in contacting him and to be very careful what he said in any such communication.  In light of this evidentiary predicate, the district court had a reasonable basis for concluding that, more likely than not, McKeeve and Sullivan were coconspirators and that Sullivan's comments to Redpath were made during and in furtherance of the conspiracy.  Consequently, the decision to admit Sullivan's hearsay statements under the coconspirator exception did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p>B. Admission of Lane's Testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During trial, Eric Lane, a British customs official, testified that the appellant spoke to him anent DTI's earlier warning that virtually all computers sent to Libya ended up in arms factories.  The appellant objected to this testimony on relevancy grounds and added that, to the extent the testimony might otherwise be admissible, it was unduly prejudicial.  He argued then, and reasserts now, that since U.S. law bans the export of any product (except certain humanitarian aid) to any Libyan entity, the fact that a DTI official had warned him that computer shipments would be used to outfit Libyan arms factories is irrelevant to any crime charged in the indictment.  For its part, the government points to the appellant's admission that he knew all along that the U.S. embargo at least paralleled United Nations sanctions (which explicitly prohibit the sale of equipment destined for Libyan military applications), and that, in light of this admission, Lane's testimony tended to undercut the appellant's claim that he did not realize the Afromed transaction transgressed U.S. law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court accepted the government's position, but told the jury that it could consider the proffered testimony only with regard to McKeeve's state of mind (i.e., whether he plotted to contravene the Libyan embargo in knowing violation of IEEPA) and not for the truth of the matter asserted.  We review this decision for abuse of discretion.  See Houlihan, 92 F.3d at 1297.   We detect no abuse either in the trial court's decision to admit Lane's testimony as probative of McKeeve's state of mind or in its refusal to exclude the proffer under Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevancy objection requires scant comment.  Fed.R.Evid. 401 deems relevant evidence that has \"any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\"   The instant indictment charged the appellant with knowingly and willfully violating, and conspiring to violate, IEEPA.  His state of mind, assessable only by indirect proof, see United States v. St. Michael's Credit Union, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526736\"><a href=\"/opinion/526736/united-states-v-st-michaels-credit-union-and-janice-sacharczyk/\"><span class=\"volume\">880</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span>, 600 (1st Cir.1989), was of critical importance to the resolution of these charges.  When, as now, the prosecution offers evidence bearing on an inherently subjective inquiry, the relevancy threshold is at its lowest.  See United States v. Tierney, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"451517\"><a href=\"/opinion/451517/united-states-v-robert-f-tierney/\"><span class=\"volume\">760</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">382</span></a></span>, 387 (1st Cir.1985).  Seen in this light, Judge Keeton reasonably could conclude--as, indeed, he did--that McKeeve's knowledge of the likely end use of the computer equipment tended to make less probable his state-of-mind defense.  Hence, the judge did not err in admitting the statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rule 403 objection is similarly unavailing.  That rule directs a trial court to exclude relevant evidence if, inter alia, \"its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\"   But almost all evidence is meant to be prejudicial--why else would a party seek to introduce it?--and it is only unfairly prejudicial evidence that must be banished.  See United States v. Rodriguez-Estrada, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524961\"><a href=\"/opinion/524961/united-states-v-hector-m-rodriguez-estrada/\"><span class=\"volume\">877</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span>, 156 (1st Cir.1989).  Although the Lane testimony may have prejudiced the appellant in the sense that it fit, tongue and groove, into the prosecution's theory of the case, there is nothing unfair about the jury's weighing of it for the limited purpose of determining the appellant's state of mind.  For this reason, we decline the appellant's invitation to second-guess the district judge's evidentiary gravimetry.  See Freeman v. Package Mach. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"517427\"><a href=\"/opinion/517427/49-fair-emplpraccas-1139-48-empl-prac-dec-p-38456-27-fed-r-evid/\"><span class=\"volume\">865</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1331</span></a></span>, 1340 (1st Cir.1988) (\"Only rarely--and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances--will we, from the vista of a cold appellate record, reverse a district court's on-the-spot judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p>C. Admission of Harmon's Testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant also cries foul in respect to a statement made at trial by David Harmon, a Treasury Department official, to the effect that the U.S. embargo against Libya resulted from a presidential determination that Libya supports international terrorism.  Because the appellant did not lodge a contemporaneous objection to this testimony, we ordinarily would review his belated challenge for plain error.  See United States v. Griffin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488020\"><a href=\"/opinion/488020/united-states-v-barry-j-griffin/\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span>, 99-100 (1st Cir.1987).  Here, however, the circumstances obviate any need to engage in plain error review.  See United States v. Castro-Lara, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587572\"><a href=\"/opinion/587572/united-states-v-ramon-castro-lara-united-states-of-america-v-abraham/\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">976</span></a></span>, 981 n. 5 (1st Cir.1992) (explaining that, if no error inheres, plain error review becomes a superfluous step).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government called Harmon to establish the existence and effect of the economic sanctions imposed against Libya.  Harmon's description of the purpose behind the embargo provided the jury with relevant background information that helped to stitch together an appropriate context in which the jury could assess the evidence introduced during the trial.  Admitting Harmon's statement was well within the realm of the district court's discretion.  See, e.g., Castro-Lara, 970 F.2d at 981;  United States v. Daly, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"503756\"><a href=\"/opinion/503756/united-states-v-george-daly-and-louis-giardina/\"><span class=\"volume\">842</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1380</span></a></span>, 1388 (2d Cir.1988).  Trials are meaty affairs, and appellate courts should not insist that all taste be extracted from a piece of evidence before a jury can chew on it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p>D. Prosecutorial Misconduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's next assignment of error is predicated on a claim that the prosecutor overstepped her bounds during opening and closing arguments.  This claim is a superscription that grows out of the prosecutor's references to Lane's testimony in her opening statement and to Harmon's testimony in her summation.  Because the prosecutor, on each occasion, did no more than describe accurately testimony that the jury would hear or already had heard, the assignment of error fails.  At least in the absence of highly exceptional circumstances (not present here), a comment by counsel in the course of jury summation that merely recounts properly admitted testimony, accurately and without embellishment or distortion, cannot constitute reversible error.  See Jentges v. Milwaukee County Circuit Court, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"435270\"><a href=\"/opinion/435270/donald-lee-jentges-v-milwaukee-county-circuit-court-honorable-harold-b/\"><span class=\"volume\">733</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1238</span></a></span>, 1242 (7th Cir.1984).  So, too, a comment in the course of an opening statement that merely presages subsequently admitted testimony cannot constitute reversible error.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. SENTENCING</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court sentenced the appellant to a prison term of 51 months, the low end of the applicable guideline sentencing range (offense level 24;  criminal history category I).  Salvaging scant succor from this fact, the appellant strives to persuade us that the court made two material errors in its sentencing calculations.  We are unconvinced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p>A. Evasion of National Security Controls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to export control offenses, the sentencing guidelines provide for a base offense level (BOL) of 14 unless \"national security or nuclear proliferation controls were evaded,\" in which case the BOL escalates to 22.  USSG &#167; 2M5.1(a).  The lower court found that the offense of conviction qualified for the eight-level enhancement.  The appellant claims that this ruling is based on an erroneous reading of the enhancement provision.  Because this claim implicates the meaning and scope of the guideline, our review is plenary.  See United States v. Muniz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195951\"><a href=\"/opinion/195951/united-states-v-muniz/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 41 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's core contention is that USSG &#167; 2M5.1(a)(1) cannot apply in a sale-of-goods case unless the government presents evidence that the particular goods, when or if sold, constitute an actual threat to national security.  We disagree.  In Executive Order No. 12,543, the President determined that Libya posed an \"unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States\" and therefore ordered an embargo covering the exportation of virtually all goods to Libya.  The embargo is an exercise of executive power authorized by IEEPA \"to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat ... to the national security.\"  50 U.S.C. &#167; 1701.  In short, the embargo is intended as a national security control.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends the matter.  As we read it, section 2M5.1(a)(1) applies to any offense that involves a shipment (or proposed shipment) that offends the embargo, whether or not the goods shipped actually are intended for some innocent use.  See United States v. Shetterly, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587657\"><a href=\"/opinion/587657/united-states-v-donald-lynn-shetterly/\"><span class=\"volume\">971</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></a></span>, 76 (7th Cir.1992).  The appellant's argument to the contrary seeks to substitute the judgment of a factfinder for that of the executive branch, which has made a determination that the export of any goods to Libya, excepting only certain humanitarian aid, threatens national security interests.  Such a course is fraught with separation-of-powers perils, see Department of the Navy v. Egan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111990\"><a href=\"/opinion/111990/department-of-navy-v-egan/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></a></span>, 527, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111990\"><a href=\"/opinion/111990/department-of-navy-v-egan/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Obstruction of Justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's remaining complaint is equally unavailing.  At the disposition hearing, the district court increased the appellant's BOL for obstruction of justice.  See USSG &#167; 3C1.1.  The court based this two-level enhancement on a finding that McKeeve committed perjury when he testified that he did not know his actions violated U.S. law.  We review a sentencing court's factbound finding of perjury for clear error.  See United States v. Akitoye, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"554021\"><a href=\"/opinion/554021/united-states-v-adegboyega-akitoye/\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">221</span></a></span>, 229 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before imposing an obstruction of justice enhancement predicated on perjurious testimony, a sentencing court must survey the trial evidence to ascertain whether it establishes that the defendant gave \"false testimony concerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide false testimony rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory.\"  United States v. Dunnigan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112821\"><a href=\"/opinion/112821/united-states-v-dunnigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span>, 94, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112821\"><a href=\"/opinion/112821/united-states-v-dunnigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span> (1993).  The court's findings need not be precise to the point of pedantry.  While separate findings as to each element are preferable, the sentencing court's determination is sustainable so long as it \"encompasses all of the factual predicates.\"  Id. at 95, 113 S.Ct. at 1117.   This is such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant does not challenge the materiality component of the district court's determination.  Rather, he concentrates his fire on the finding of falsity.  He cites language that once appeared in the Sentencing Commission's commentary, USSG &#167; 3C1.1, comment.  (n.1) (Nov. 1995) and earlier editions, to the effect that in applying section 3C1.1 \"in respect to alleged false testimony or statements by the defendant, such testimony or statements should be evaluated in a light most favorable to the defendant,\" and claims that the sentencing court erred by failing to consider his testimonial statements accordingly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most recent version of the guidelines deleted this language, see USSG App.  C, amend.  566 (Nov.1997), but it was zoetic at the time of the appellant's sentencing, and he is therefore entitled to its benefit.  See United States v. Harotunian, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552769\"><a href=\"/opinion/552769/united-states-v-dennis-harotunian/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1040</span></a></span>, 1041-42 (1st Cir.1990).  But, this circumstance does not profit McKeeve.  His suggested reading of the language would allow \"the safeguard [to] swallow the rule in a single gulp,\" Akitoye, 923 F.2d at 228, and we long have rejected it.  In its heyday the now-discarded language never required sentencing courts to resolve all evidentiary conflicts to the defendant's benefit.  Thus, a sentencing court required to apply that language today need only construe allegedly perjurious statements in a defendant-favorable way if such statements are genuinely ambiguous or if the record, after credibility determinations have been made, plausibly supports an innocent interpretation.  See United States v. Clark, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196789\"><a href=\"/opinion/196789/united-states-v-clark/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span>, 510 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Numerous witnesses testified to incriminating statements and conduct that occurred before the appellant claims he became aware of possible legal problems.  This evidence strongly supports a finding that the appellant knew all along that his actions were illegal.  In these circumstances, the obsolete language is inapposite and the district court's finding of perjury is unimpugnable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The supportability of this finding likewise defeats the appellant's related claim that the two-level enhancement punished him for exercising his constitutional right to testify in his own defense.  That right, though precious, does not include a right to commit perjury.  See Dunnigan, 507 U.S. at 96, 113 S.Ct. at 1117-18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  To the extent that the appellant rolls out other arguments, they are plainly inadequate and do not warrant discussion.  The short of it is that, in colloguing to sell computer equipment to Libya, McKeeve spun a tangled international web that ultimately ensnared its creator.  For that conduct, he was lawfully indicted, fairly tried, justly convicted, and appropriately sentenced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The appellant asserts that the government did not make a bona fide effort to facilitate his attendance at Redpath's deposition.  The record, which includes the correspondence between the two governments, refutes this assertion</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The appellant offers no convincing examples of any inexactitude.
