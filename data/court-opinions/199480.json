In this appeal, the 110 Beaver Street\n\nPartnership and the Partnership's partners, individually and in\n\ntheir capacity as partners, take issue with the district court's\n\nrejection of their challenges to certain orders issued by the\n\nbankruptcy court during the Partnership's attempt to reorganize\n\nunder Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.1             Specifically, insofar\n\nas is relevant, appellants contend that the district court erred\n\nin reaching the following four conclusions:                (1) appellants'\n\nappeal of the appointment of a Chapter 11 trustee was untimely,\n\n(2) appellants effectively waived their right to appeal the\n\nbankruptcy     court's     allowance     of   certain    professional      fee\n\napplications    by     failing   to   lodge   timely    objections    to   the\n\napplications in the bankruptcy court, (3) the bankruptcy court\n\ndid not clearly err in denying the Partnership's motion to\n\nemploy   as   its    counsel     David   J.   Fine,    Esq.,   and   (4)   the\n\nbankruptcy     court     acted   lawfully     in   declining    on   several\n\noccasions to hear argument on behalf of the Partnership from Mr.\n\nFine.2\n\n\n     1\n     The attempt at reorganization was unsuccessful and the\nbankruptcy court eventually converted the case to a Chapter 7\nproceeding.\n     2In their brief, appellants also challenged the district\ncourt's affirmation of the bankruptcy court's denial of their\nBankruptcy Rule 9024 and Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(3) motion for\nrelief from the October 8, 1997 order permitting foreclosure on\nthe Partnership's principal asset. At oral argument, however,\n\n                                      -4-\n\f           We have given careful consideration to appellants'\n\narguments and are of the opinion that they fail to undermine the\n\nreasoning which led to these four conclusions, which is cogently\n\nset forth in the district court's February 11, 2000 memorandum\n\nof decision.         That being the case, we will not reinvent the\n\nwheel.    We affirm the district court's judgment largely on the\n\nbasis of the district court's memorandum of decision,                  e.g.,\n\nMullin v. Raytheon Co., 164 F.3d 696, 699 (1st Cir.),                  cert.\n\ndenied,    528   U.S.    811   (1999),     adding   only    the    following\n\nqualifications and elaborations:\n\n           1.    We reject appellants' suggestion that it is an open\n\nquestion in this circuit whether the appointment of a Chapter 11\n\ntrustee    is    a     final   and   immediately     appealable      order.\n\nNotwithstanding its idiosyncratic facts, we think that In re\n\nPlaza de Diego Shopping Center, Inc., 911 F.2d 820 (1st Cir.\n\n1990),    clearly     establishes,    as   a   general     rule,   that   the\n\nappointment of a Chapter 11 trustee is \"a final decision of a\n\nsignificant and discrete dispute . . . [which] is appealable,\"\n\nid. at 826.      The district court was duty-bound to apply this\n\nprecedent, as is this newly-constituted panel.                 E.g. United\n\nStates v. Owens, 167 F.3d 739, 754 n.7 (1st Cir.), cert. denied,\n\n\n\n\nappellants explicitly dropped their challenges to this ruling.\n\n                                     -5-\n\f528 U.S. 894 (1999).      Appellants remain free, of course, to\n\npetition the en banc court to revisit the matter.       See id.\n\n           2.    Appellants do not contend that they are entitled\n\nto ask for appellate review even if they failed to lodge an\n\nobjection to the fee applications they now seek to challenge.\n\nRather, they make two arguments: (a) the Partnership's December\n\n12, 1997 motion to postpone the adjudication of the pending fee\n\napplications, filed by     Attorney Fine as \"Proposed Counsel for\n\nDebtor\" on the day objections were due,3 was a de facto objection\n\nto   the   fee   applications,   and   (b)   the   bankruptcy   court\n\neffectively deprived them of the opportunity to object to the\n\nfee applications by failing to rule either on the aforesaid\n\nmotion to postpone or the Partnership's December 8, 1997 motion\n\nto employ Attorney Fine as counsel prior to issuing its order\n\nallowing the fee applications.     Both arguments lack merit.\n\n           As appellants appear to recognize,       see Appellants'\n\nBrief at 45, an efficacious opposition requires the presentation\n\nof \"evidence and legal authorities which will be of aid to the\n\ncourt in making its decision.\"     In re Malmart Mortg. Co., Inc.,\n\n166 B.R. 499, 503 (D. Mass. 1994).     The Partnership's motion to\n\n\n\n     3The original due date for objections was December 5, 1997,\nbut the bankruptcy court extended the deadline to December 12,\n1997 when it allowed the Partnership's untimely December 8, 1997\nmotion for a one-week extension.\n\n                                 -6-\n\fpostpone contained no such presentation.          Indeed, the motion\n\nimplicitly acknowledged that it was not an objection when it\n\nstated: \"It is beyond the scope of this motion to describe the\n\nDebtor's view [as to why one of the fee applications should be\n\ndenied] and the grounds for that view in any detail.\"             Given\n\nthis   statement,   appellants'   first   argument    is   difficult   to\n\ncomprehend.\n\n           Appellants' second argument fares no better.        We think\n\nit obvious that a party cannot unilaterally push back a case\n\nmanagement due date by filing a motion to extend the deadline\n\n(which was, in effect, the relief sought by the motion to\n\npostpone) on the due date itself.       Similarly, if the Partnership\n\nsaw the retention of counsel as a prerequisite to filing a\n\ntimely objection to the fee application, it should have so\n\nadvised the bankruptcy court explicitly.             The Partnership's\n\ngeneric motion to employ counsel, filed three days after the\n\nexpiration of the original deadline and four days before the\n\nextended deadline, fell well short of doing so.\n\n           3.   To the district court's convincing explanation for\n\nrejecting appellants' assignment of error with respect to the\n\nmotion to employ Attorney Fine, we add only that appellants do\n\nnot contradict the Trustee's assertion, see Trustee's Brief at\n\n22-23, that Attorney Fine represents Paul McGinty, who has\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fasserted     claims   against    the   Partnership.       Attorney     Fine\n\nobviously cannot simultaneously represent the Partnership and\n\none of its creditors.     See Rome v. Braunstein, 19 F.3d 54, 57-58\n\n(1st Cir. 1994).\n\n            4.   Finally, we have scrutinized the portions of the\n\nrecord cited by appellants in support of their argument that the\n\nbankruptcy court improperly prevented Mr. Fine from speaking on\n\nbehalf of the Partnership but see no            factual basis for the\n\nargument.     And even if there were such a basis, it does not\n\nappear    that   appellants     brought   the   alleged   error   to    the\n\nattention of the bankruptcy court.          The argument therefore is\n\nwaived.     E.g., In re Rauh, 119 F.3d 46, 51 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n            Affirmed.   Costs are awarded to appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f",
