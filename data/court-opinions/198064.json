Plaintiff-appellant Christian Guex appeals from the\r\ndismissal with prejudice of his complaint.  The dismissal was a\r\nsanction for his failure to appear at his own deposition, as well\r\nas for earlier violations of discovery orders.  He argues that\r\n the dismissal was too severe a sanction.  We disagree, and\r\n                          affirm.\r\n In dismissing the plaintiff's complaint, the district court\r\nrelied on Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which\r\n               provides, in pertinent part, \r\n(d) If a party . . . fails (1) to appear before the officer who\r\nis to take the deposition, after being served with proper notice,\r\n  or (2)  to serve answers or objections to interrogatories\r\nsubmitted under Rule 33, after proper service of interrogatories,\r\n. . . the court in which the action is pending on motion may make\r\n such orders in regard to the failure as are just, and among\r\n      others it may [issue various orders, including:] \r\n                           . . .\r\n(b)(2)(C) An order striking out pleadings or parts thereof, or\r\n  staying further proceedings until the order is obeyed, or\r\n dismissing the action or proceeding or any part thereof, or\r\nrendering a judgment by default against the disobedient party.\r\n\n Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(d) &amp; 37(b)(2)(C) (emphasis added).    \r\nWe review the trial court's imposition and selection of sanctions\r\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(d) for abuse of discretion, in deference\r\nto that court's greater familiarity with the parties appearing\r\nbefore it.  See Goldman, Antonetti, Ferraiuoli, Axtmayer, &amp;\r\nHertell v. Medfit Int'l, Inc., 982 F.2d 686, 692 (1st Cir. 1993). \r\nMoreover, the Supreme Court has stated that a reviewing court, in\r\nassessing the severity of the sanctions imposed by a trial court,\r\nmust give due regard to the deterrent effect of the sanctions:\r\n  [T]he most severe in the spectrum of sanctions provided by\r\n sanction or rule must be available to the district court in\r\nappropriate cases, not merely to penalize those whose conduct may\r\n be deemed to warrant such a sanction, but to deter those who\r\n  might be tempted to such conduct in the absence of such a\r\n                          deterrent.\r\n\nNational Hockey League v. Metropolitan Hockey Club, Inc., 427\r\nU.S. 639, 643 (1976); see also Roadway Express, Inc. v. Piper,\r\n447 U.S. 752, 763-64 (1980); Goldman, Antonetti, 982 F.2d at 692. \r\nThere is also \"nothing in the rule that states or suggests that\r\nthe sanction of dismissal can be used only after all the other\r\nsanctions [available under Rule 37] have been considered or\r\ntried.\"  Damiani v. Rhode Island Hosp., 704 F.2d 12, 15 (1st Cir.\r\n1988).  Thus, \"[a] plaintiff who appeals such a dismissal bears a\r\nheavy burden of demonstrating that the trial judge was clearlynot justified in entering an order of dismissal under Rule 37.\" \r\nSpiller v. U.S.V. Labs., Inc., 842 F.2d 535, 537 (1st Cir. 1988)\r\n                     (emphasis added).\r\nMr. Guex filed this action on March 13, 1995, seeking to collect\r\nthe benefits allegedly due to him under a disability policy\r\nissued by defendant-appellee Allmerica Financial Life Insurance\r\nand Annuity Company (\"Allmerica\").  He claims that he is totally\r\ndisabled and therefore incapable of performing his duties as\r\npresident of Guex Tooling Company, of which he is also the sole\r\nshareholder.  The parties consented to have a United States\r\nMagistrate Judge conduct all proceedings in this case pursuant to\r\n                   28 U.S.C.  636(c)(1).\r\nOn May 29, 1997, Allmerica notified Mr. Guex that his deposition\r\nwould be taken starting on Monday, June 23, 1997.  On Thursday,\r\nJune 19, 1997, counsel for Mr. Guex confirmed that he would\r\nattend his deposition.  Four days later, approximately one hour\r\nbefore the deposition was slated to begin, counsel for Mr. Guex\r\ncalled Allmerica to reveal that an unidentified person had called\r\n  his office to say that Mr. Guex would not appear for the\r\n                        deposition.\r\n Mr. Guex did, indeed, fail to appear at his deposition.  No\r\nexcuse or explanation was given.  His counsel said that he would\r\ntry to communicate with Mr. Guex, and then call Allmerica to\r\nprovide the reasons why he had not appeared.  When counsel for\r\nMr. Guex called back, however, it was to say that he had not been\r\n           able to communicate with his client.  \r\n   On July 1, 1997, Allmerica filed a motion requesting the\r\ndismissal of the complaint due to Mr. Guex's failure to attend\r\nhis own deposition.  The following day, the magistrate judge\r\nordered Mr. Guex to show cause in writing within five days \"why\r\nthis case should not be dismissed for want of prosecution or for\r\nthe imposition of any other sanctions, which may include the\r\ncertification for contempt proceedings.\"  The plaintiff failed to\r\nrespond to the order to show cause within the prescribed period,\r\nneither by filing a motion showing cause, nor even by filing a\r\n              motion for extension of time.  \r\n Three weeks later, Mr. Guex finally filed a response to the\r\nmotion for sanctions.  His response, however, utterly failed to\r\nprovide any explanation for his failure to attend his deposition. \r\nIn this regard, we do not consider his general references to an\r\nalleged \"impossibility to attend his deposition\" and unspecified\r\n\"last-minute problems\" to be adequate responses, particularly\r\nbecause they were unaccompanied by any indication of the nature\r\n          and source of his last-minute problems.\r\nNotwithstanding the fact that Mr. Guex had missed the deadline\r\nset by the order to show cause, the magistrate judge waited until\r\nafter Guex had responded to rule on the motion for sanctions.  On\r\nAugust 1, 1997, the magistrate judge entered an opinion and order\r\n granting the motion to dismiss, and on August 11, 1997, he\r\nentered judgment dismissing the complaint with prejudice.  On\r\n     that same date, Mr. Guex filed a motion requesting\r\nreconsideration of the order dismissing the complaint, arguing\r\nthat his failure to attend the deposition \"was due to out of his\r\ncontrol circumstances [sic] that this court has shown no interest\r\nin hearing.\"  On August 19, 1997, the magistrate judge denied the\r\n                motion for reconsideration.\r\nWe find no abuse of discretion in the magistrate judge's decision\r\nto dismiss Mr. Guex's complaint as a sanction for his conduct. \r\nTo the contrary, we think that the district court exhibited\r\nextraordinary patience.  Mr. Guex has demonstrated a troubling\r\nlack of respect for the judicial process by failing to appear at\r\nhis deposition, failing to explain his failure, and then having\r\nthe impertinence to suggest that the magistrate judge had shown\r\n no interest in hearing his side of the story.  The record\r\ndiscloses that the magistrate judge gave Mr. Guex not one, but\r\nthree opportunities to proffer an explanation for his failure to\r\n                 appear at the deposition.\r\nThe first time that an explanation was provided was in Mr. Guex's\r\nbrief in this appeal, filed three months later on November 21,\r\n1997.  The entire extent of his new, more complete explanation,\r\nis that he was unable to attend his deposition because he had to\r\ntravel to Switzerland \"for reasons of family health problems.\" \r\nBecause it is a mere assertion of counsel rather than a statement\r\nmade under oath, and because no proof is offered to support it,\r\n one might reasonably question the credibility of the newly\r\n proffered explanation.  However, we need not address this\r\nquestion, since we cannot consider an explanation that was not\r\nprovided to the trial court.  See Villafae-Neriz v. FDIC, 75\r\n               F.3d 727, 734 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\nMr. Guex also argues, however, that the magistrate judge abused\r\nhis discretion because in dismissing Guex's complaint, he took\r\ninto consideration not only Guex's own failure to appear at the\r\ndeposition, but also the numerous violations of discovery orders\r\ncommitted by Guex's company.  Guex contends that a court should\r\nnot consider the actions of a non-party in determining whether a\r\nparty should be sanctioned under Rule 37(d).  Although Guex's\r\ncontention holds true in most cases, there are some exceptions,\r\n                     such as this case.\r\nFirst, not all of the incidents mentioned by the magistrate judge\r\ninvolved a non-party.  For example, on one occasion, Mr. Guex was\r\n       given direct orders by the magistrate judge: \r\nto instruct his corporation to proceed with the production of the\r\ndocuments requested in defendant's subpoena [duces tecum]. . . . \r\n  More than reasonable time has already been granted to this\r\ncorporation for the production of said documents. . . .  There\r\nare some indications of stonewalling maneuvers by the corporation\r\n  to avoid discovery by defendant.  Severe sanctions will be\r\nimposed for failure to comply with this order, which may include\r\na certification for contempt proceedings or the dismissal of the\r\n                          complaint.\r\n\nConference Report, App. at 75.  Mr. Guex did not file for a\r\nprotective order or otherwise seek reconsideration of this order. \r\nInstead, his corporation failed to comply with the discovery\r\nrequests, and there is no evidence that Guex did anything to\r\ncomply with the order he was given to ensure that his company\r\nproduced the requested documents.  At least in this instance,\r\ntherefore, there is no question that the magistrate judge could\r\nattribute to Mr. Guex the company's violation of the order.\r\n  Second, like the magistrate judge, we cannot overlook the\r\nplaintiff's abuse of the corporate form to avoid his discovery\r\nobligations.  Throughout the pre-trial proceedings in this case,\r\nthe plaintiff's wholly owned company violated numerous discovery\r\norders.  The plaintiff, however, took the position that his\r\ncompany's violations were none of his concern, even though he is\r\n  the president of the company, and his lawyer is also the\r\ncompany's lawyer.  For example, on one occasion, Guex Tooling was\r\ncited for a deposition and served with a deposition subpoena\r\n  duces tecum for certain documents to be produced at the\r\ndeposition.  At the stated date no one appeared to serve as the\r\nofficial representative of the company, and the deposition had to\r\nbe continued until a later date.  Sitting in the room, however,\r\nwere Mr. Guex and his counsel.  Mr. Guex, the president and 100%\r\nowner of Guex Tooling, and his counsel, who was also representing\r\nGuex Tooling, provided no explanation for the company's failure\r\n                        to appear.  \r\n Surveying the entire pre-trial process, the magistrate judge\r\nevidently found that Mr. Guex was responsible for failing to\r\nprevent his company's repeated violations.  Moreover, Mr. Guex\r\nfailed even to explain why he could not ensure the company's\r\ncompliance with the defendants' discovery requests.  In light of\r\nthis information, the magistrate judge was entitled to find that\r\nMr. Guex had feigned his inability to control his company's\r\nconduct and, thus, had acted in bad faith.  Accordingly, we find\r\nthat the sanction of dismissal with prejudice was well within the\r\n               magistrate judge's discretion.\r\nFor the reasons stated above, we affirm the magistrate judge's\r\njudgment dismissing the complaint with prejudice.  Double costs\r\n                 are awarded to appellees.\r\n",

Mr. Guex has demonstrated a troubling\r\nlack of respect for the judicial process by failing to appear at\r\nhis deposition, failing to explain his failure, and then having\r\nthe impertinence to suggest that the magistrate judge had shown\r\n no interest in hearing his side of the story.  The record\r\ndiscloses that the magistrate judge gave Mr. Guex not one, but\r\nthree opportunities to proffer an explanation for his failure to\r\n                 appear at the deposition.\r\nThe first time that an explanation was provided was in Mr. Guex's\r\nbrief in this appeal, filed three months later on November 21,\r\n1997.  The entire extent of his new, more complete explanation,\r\nis that he was unable to attend his deposition because he had to\r\ntravel to Switzerland \"for reasons of family health problems.\" \r\nBecause it is a mere assertion of counsel rather than a statement\r\nmade under oath, and because no proof is offered to support it,\r\n one might reasonably question the credibility of the newly\r\n proffered explanation.  However, we need not address this\r\nquestion, since we cannot consider an explanation that was not\r\nprovided to the trial court.  See Villafae-Neriz v. FDIC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"712177\"><a href=\"/opinion/712177/miguel-villafane-neriz-insurance-commissioner-of-puerto-rico-v-federal/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span>\r\n               <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">727</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 734 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\nMr. Guex also argues, however, that the magistrate judge abused\r\nhis discretion because in dismissing Guex's complaint, he took\r\ninto consideration not only Guex's own failure to appear at the\r\ndeposition, but also the numerous violations of discovery orders\r\ncommitted by Guex's company.  Guex contends that a court should\r\nnot consider the actions of a non-party in determining whether a\r\nparty should be sanctioned under Rule 37(d).  Although Guex's\r\ncontention holds true in most cases, there are some exceptions,\r\n                     such as this case.\r\nFirst, not all of the incidents mentioned by the magistrate judge\r\ninvolved a non-party.  For example, on one occasion, Mr. Guex was\r\n       given direct orders by the magistrate judge: \r\nto instruct his corporation to proceed with the production of the\r\ndocuments requested in defendant's subpoena [duces tecum]. . . . \r\n  More than reasonable time has already been granted to this\r\ncorporation for the production of said documents. . . .  There\r\nare some indications of stonewalling maneuvers by the corporation\r\n  to avoid discovery by defendant.  Severe sanctions will be\r\nimposed for failure to comply with this order, which may include\r\na certification for contempt proceedings or the dismissal of the\r\n                          complaint.\r\n\nConference Report, App. at 75.  Mr. Guex did not file for a\r\nprotective order or otherwise seek reconsideration of this order. \r\nInstead, his corporation failed to comply with the discovery\r\nrequests, and there is no evidence that Guex did anything to\r\ncomply with the order he was given to ensure that his company\r\nproduced the requested documents.  At least in this instance,\r\ntherefore, there is no question that the magistrate judge could\r\nattribute to Mr. Guex the company's violation of the order.\r\n  Second, like the magistrate judge, we cannot overlook the\r\nplaintiff's abuse of the corporate form to avoid his discovery\r\nobligations.  Throughout the pre-trial proceedings in this case,\r\nthe plaintiff's wholly owned company violated numerous discovery\r\norders.  The plaintiff, however, took the position that his\r\ncompany's violations were none of his concern, even though he is\r\n  the president of the company, and his lawyer is also the\r\ncompany's lawyer.  For example, on one occasion, Guex Tooling was\r\ncited for a deposition and served with a deposition subpoena\r\n  duces tecum for certain documents to be produced at the\r\ndeposition.  At the stated date no one appeared to serve as the\r\nofficial representative of the company, and the deposition had to\r\nbe continued until a later date.  Sitting in the room, however,\r\nwere Mr. Guex and his counsel.  Mr. Guex, the president and 100%\r\nowner of Guex Tooling, and his counsel, who was also representing\r\nGuex Tooling, provided no explanation for the company's failure\r\n                        to appear.  \r\n Surveying the entire pre-trial process, the magistrate judge\r\nevidently found that Mr. Guex was responsible for failing to\r\nprevent his company's repeated violations.  Moreover, Mr. Guex\r\nfailed even to explain why he could not ensure the company's\r\ncompliance with the defendants' discovery requests.  In light of\r\nthis information, the magistrate judge was entitled to find that\r\nMr. Guex had feigned his inability to control his company's\r\nconduct and, thus, had acted in bad faith.  Accordingly, we find\r\nthat the sanction of dismissal with prejudice was well within the\r\n               magistrate judge's discretion.\r\nFor the reasons stated above, we affirm the magistrate judge's\r\njudgment dismissing the complaint with prejudice.  Double costs\r\n                 are awarded to appellees.\r\n</pre>",
