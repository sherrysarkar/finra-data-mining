Polaroid  contends that  the District  Court\r\n\nerred  in denying  Polaroid's motions  for summary  judgment, for\r\n\njudgment  as a matter  of law  and for a  new trial.   Because we\r\n\nconclude that  the motion for judgment as  a matter of law should\r\n\nhave  been granted with respect to some of Lattimore's claims and\r\n\nbecause it appears  that the  jury's verdict may  have rested  on\r\n\nthose claims, we vacate the judgment and remand for a new trial.\r\n\n                        Factual Background\r                                  Factual Background\r                                                    \r\n\n          Ollie Lattimore, a black man, was hired  by Polaroid in\r\n\n1977 as a machine operator.  During part of Lattimore's tenure at\r\n\nPolaroid,  his supervisor  was Bill  Mitchell, a  white man.   In\r\n\n1978,    Lattimore  sustained  a  job-related  back  injury  that\r\n\nresulted  in his  being placed  on a  \"medical restriction\"  that\r\n\nlimited  his  duties to  tasks  that did  not  require repetitive\r\n\nbending, twisting  or lifting objects weighing  more than fifteen\r\n\npounds.   The restriction was  renewed each year  until 1989 and,\r\n\nbecause of it, Lattimore was assigned to light-duty work.\r\n\n          At trial,  Lattimore testified that, in  March of 1989,\r\n\nMitchell assigned  him to certain janitorial  tasks that required\r\n\nheavier  lifting.   When  Lattimore  protested  that his  medical\r\n\nrestriction prevented  him from performing  those tasks, Mitchell\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nallegedly replied, \"I'm  sick of  you people all  the time  lazy,\r\n\ntrying to skip work.  There is the door.  Don't let it hit you in\r\n\nthe ass.\"  Lattimore  interpreted the statement as a  racial slur\r\n\nand stated that  he began  doing the janitorial  work because  he\r\n\nfeared  for his job.  Mitchell denied asking Lattimore to perform\r\n\ntasks  prohibited  by his  medical  restriction  and also  denied\r\n\nmaking the statement attributed to him.\r\n\n          According  to  Lattimore, on  March  16,  1989, he  re-\r\n\ninjured his back while emptying a barrel into a dumpster.   Later\r\n\nthat day,  he was seen by  Dr. Hillier, a physician  who had been\r\n\ntreating him  for his  pre-existing back  problems.   Dr. Hillier\r\n\nprovided  Lattimore with the first in a series of reports stating\r\n\nthat  Lattimore  was  disabled  from  returning  to  work.    The\r\n\nfollowing  day, Lattimore  presented the  report to  Mitchell who\r\n\nallegedly  said,  \"I'm  getting sick  and  tired  of  you people.\r\n\nYou're  all  lazy all  the time.\"    Mitchell denied  making that\r\n\nstatement, too.\r\n\n          In any event, Polaroid immediately placed  Lattimore on\r\n\nshort-term disability  (\"STD\") status pursuant  to the  company's\r\n\nshort-term disability policy.  Under  that policy, an employee is\r\n\neligible for  STD benefits if  medical reports  submitted by  the\r\n\nemployee's  treating physician  support the  conclusion that  the\r\n\nemployee is totally disabled.   The policy further provides  that\r\n\nin the event that  Polaroid's Medical Review Board (\"the  Board\")\r\n\ndisagrees  with  the  assessment  by  the  employee's  physician,\r\n\nPolaroid may require an independent medical examination  (\"IME\"),\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nthe  results of which will  be deemed conclusive  with respect to\r\n\nthe employee's ability to work.\r\n\n          Approximately twelve weeks after Lattimore was accorded\r\n\nSTD status,  Dr. Kantrowitz, Polaroid's medical  director and the\r\n\nchairman  of the Medical Review Board, spoke to Dr. Hillier about\r\n\nLattimore's condition.  Dr.  Hillier indicated that Lattimore was\r\n\nimproving and  should be able to return to work  on July 24 if an\r\n\nexamination  scheduled  for  July  21 showed  the  progress  that\r\n\nDr. Hillier anticipated.\r\n\n          After subsequently receiving a report  from Dr. Hillier\r\n\nlisting Lattimore's condition as \"undetermined\" and learning that\r\n\nthe examination  scheduled for July  21 had been  postponed until\r\n\nAugust 8, the Board decided to require an IME without waiting for\r\n\nthe results of Dr. Hillier's  examination.  Polaroid claims  that\r\n\nthe Board's  decision was based  on ambiguities in  Dr. Hillier's\r\n\nreports and on  the results  of a July  13 workers'  compensation\r\n\nexamination performed  by Dr. James Dolphin  which indicated that\r\n\nLattimore  was  able to  perform  light  work.   Apparently,  Dr.\r\n\nDolphin's  findings had  caused Lattimore  to be  denied workers'\r\n\ncompensation benefits.\r\n\n          The Board gave Lattimore  the opportunity to select one\r\n\nof three \"independent\" physicians to conduct the IME and he chose\r\n\nDr. Marcos Ramos.  The IME was performed on August 23.  According\r\n\nto  Lattimore, the examination was very brief and did not include\r\n\nany  diagnostic tests.  Dr.  Ramos, on the  other hand, indicated\r\n\nthat the  examination was  thorough and lasted  approximately one\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nand one-half hours.\r\n\n          The   following   day,  Richard   Williams,  Polaroid's\r\n\ncorporate  benefits administrator,  informed  Lattimore that  Dr.\r\n\nRamos  had determined  that Lattimore  was not  totally disabled;\r\n\nthat he could return  to light-duty work immediately and  that he\r\n\ncould  resume full  duties in  two weeks.   Accordingly, Williams\r\n\ninstructed  Lattimore to return to  work the next  day.  Although\r\n\nWilliams'  statements  regarding  Dr.  Ramos'   conclusions  were\r\n\nconsistent  with the  findings  contained in  Dr. Ramos'  written\r\n\nreport, the report was not issued until one week later.  Williams\r\n\nsought  to explain  this  by testifying  that  the findings  were\r\n\nrelated  to him during a telephone conversation with Dr. Ramos on\r\n\nAugust 23.  However,  Dr. Ramos had no  recollection of any  such\r\n\nconversation.\r\n\n          Matters came to a head when Lattimore refused to return\r\n\nto  work  asserting  that he  still  was  totally  disabled.   On\r\n\nSeptember 9, Lattimore's  employment  was terminated.    Polaroid\r\n\npresented evidence  that the  decision was  made by  Eddy Montes,\r\n\nLattimore's new  supervisor, based  upon the company's  policy of\r\n\nterminating  employees who  refused to  work after  being removed\r\n\nfrom STD status.\r\n\n                        Procedural History\r                                  Procedural History\r                                                    \r\n\n          On  October   27,  1989,  Lattimore  filed   a  written\r\n\nadministrative charge  with the Massachusetts  Commission Against\r\n\nDiscrimination (\"MCAD\") and with the Equal Employment Opportunity\r\n\nCommission  (\"EEOC\").   The  charge  recited  that Lattimore  had\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nsustained a  back injury  on March 16,  1989, and  had filed  for\r\n\nworker's  compensation benefits on June 26, 1989.   It went on to\r\n\nstate that he was later fired for refusing to return to work even\r\n\nthough his back injury  rendered him totally disabled.   Based on\r\n\nthat account of the pertinent events, Lattimore alleged that:\r\n\n            Respondent does not  treat white  workers\r\n            who  are handicapped  and have  filed for\r                                                               \r\n            workers  compensation  the way  they have\r                                           \r\n            treated  me.     Ray  (Lnu),   a  machine\r\n            operator  in my department,  has been out\r\n            on  workers comp  numerous times  and has\r\n            not  been harassed  and fired  as I  have\r\n            been.  I believe  I was fired and treated\r\n            differently due to my race, black, and my\r\n            handicap,  back injury,  . .  . (emphasis\r\n            added).\r\n\n          After investigating  and finding no  probable cause  to\r\n\nbelieve  that Polaroid  had discriminated against  Lattimore, the\r\n\nMCAD  dismissed the  charge.    The  EEOC  did  not  conduct  any\r\n\nindependent investigation but accepted  MCAD's finding and issued\r\n\nLattimore a right-to-sue letter on March 24, 1992.\r\n\n          On June  22, 1992, Lattimore, acting  pro se, commenced\r                                                                \r\n\nthis  action in  the  District Court.    His complaint  was  more\r\n\ndetailed than  the administrative charge  but covered essentially\r\n\nthe same  ground.  It alluded  to the March 16  back injury which\r\n\nLattimore  attributed to  being assigned  to  duties inconsistent\r\n\nwith his medical restriction.   It also stated that,  after being\r\n\nplaced on STD status, Lattimore was wrongfully  removed from that\r\n\nstatus when  he applied  for workers' compensation  benefits that\r\n\nwould have  supplemented his  disability payments.   Finally, the\r\n\ncomplaint  referred to  Lattimore's  termination for  refusing to\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nreturn to work  despite his claim  that he was  unable to do  so.\r\n\nLike  the administrative  charge,  the  complaint asserted  that,\r\n\nbecause  of his race, Lattimore  was denied benefits  to which he\r\n\nwas entitled.  More specifically, it stated:\r\n\n            I  believe that  the Polaroid  Corp. used\r\n            the fact  that I was an  uneducated black\r\n            to  hinder my every effort to receive the\r\n            compensation  which  was   due  me   both\r\n            through  the Workmen's  Compensation laws\r\n            and  the Company's  Short  Term and  Long\r\n            Term Disability programs.\r\n\n          Nine months  later, after retaining  counsel, Lattimore\r\n\namended his  complaint.   The  amended complaint,  for the  first\r\n\ntime,  alleged that, on  unspecified occasions  after Lattimore's\r\n\n1979 back  injury, \"supervisors  and other employees  at Polaroid\r\n\nharassed  . . .  [him] . .  . about  his handicap\"  and that such\r\n\nharassment  was  \"coupled  with verbal  reference  to Lattimore's\r\n\nrace.\"\r\n\n          The amended complaint contained five counts asserting a\r\n\nvariety of claims for both handicap and race discrimination.  The\r\n\nDistrict Court  granted  Polaroid's motion  for summary  judgment\r\n\nwith respect  to three of the  counts but denied the  motion with\r\n\nrespect to  the other two counts.  The case proceeded to trial on\r\n\nthose  two counts  which  encompassed four  claims:   (1)  racial\r\n\nharassment by co-employees  in violation of Title VII; (2) racial\r\n\nharassment by co-employees in violation of Chapter 151B; (3) race\r\n\ndiscrimination regarding terms  and conditions  of employment  in\r\n\nviolation  of Title  VII; and  (4) race  discrimination regarding\r\n\nterms and conditions of employment in violation of Chapter 151B.\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\n          During trial,  evidence was  presented relating  to all\r\n\nfour claims.  That evidence included testimony about the comments\r\n\nallegedly made by Mitchell on or before March 16 and how Mitchell\r\n\nallegedly  coerced  Lattimore into  performing  work inconsistent\r\n\nwith his medical restriction thereby causing the March 16 injury.\r\n\nAt the conclusion of Lattimore's case and, again, at the close of\r\n\nthe evidence, Polaroid moved for judgment as a matter of law with\r\n\nrespect to all  four claims.  The grounds for  those motions were\r\n\nessentially the  same as  the grounds  relied upon  in Polaroid's\r\n\nprevious  motion for  summary  judgment.    Like the  motion  for\r\n\nsummary judgment, the  motions for  judgment as a  matter of  law\r\n\nwere denied.\r\n\n          The District Judge  charged the jury on all four claims\r\n\nbut  a  questionnaire  submitted  to  the  jury  asked  only  for\r\n\ndeterminations  of  whether  Lattimore was  \"racially  harassed,\"\r\n\nwhether any such harassment proximately caused injury and, if so,\r\n\nthe amount of damages to be awarded.1  See Appendix A.2  The jury\r                                                    \r\n\nanswered the  first two  questions in  the affirmative  and fixed\r\n\ndamages at $400,000.\r\n\n          After denying  Polaroid's motion  for a new  trial, the\r\n\nDistrict Court  entered judgment for  Lattimore in the  amount of\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1     Polaroid's   counsel  did   raise  an   objection  to   the\r\nquestionnaire, but that objection appeared to be directed only to\r\nthe  time frame  during  which the  alleged  harassment may  have\r\noccurred.\r\n\n2   In his brief,  Lattimore's counsel erroneously  describes the\r\nquestionnaire    as    asking   whether    Polaroid   \"unlawfully\r\ndiscriminated.\"  Appellee's Br. at 3.\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\n$562,000  representing  the  damages   fixed  by  the  jury  plus\r\n\ninterest.  It is from that judgment that Polaroid appeals.\r\n\n          In its appeal, Polaroid asserts that the District Court\r\n\nerred in  denying Polaroid's  motion for summary  judgment and/or\r\n\njudgment as a matter of law  and in denying Polaroid's motion for\r\n\na new trial.  Our analysis  is limited to reviewing the denial of\r\n\nthe   motion  for  judgment  as  a  matter  of  law  because  the\r\n\nconclusions we reach render the remaining claims of error moot.\r\n\n                            Discussion\r                                      Discussion\r                                                \r\n\n          Polaroid argues  that it was entitled to  judgment as a\r\n\nmatter  of law on the harassment claims asserted under both Title\r\n\nVII and Chapter 151B  because those claims were beyond  the scope\r\n\nof Lattimore's  administrative charge.    Polaroid also  contends\r\n\nthat judgment in its favor should have been entered regarding the\r\n\nTitle VII harassment claim because Lattimore provided no evidence\r\n\nthat  Polaroid  knew  or   should  have  known  of   the  alleged\r\n\nharassment.   Finally,  Polaroid  asserts that  the Chapter  151B\r\n\nharassment claim is barred  because the administrative charge was\r\n\nnot filed  within the period of time  prescribed by Massachusetts\r\n\nlaw.\r\n\n          With  respect  to  the discrimination  claims  Polaroid\r\n\nargues  that  Lattimore failed  to establish a  prima facie  case\r                                                                     \r\n\nbecause  he presented no evidence that he was totally disabled, a\r\n\nsine  qua  non  of eligibility  for  continued  STD  status.   In\r                        \r\n\naddition, Polaroid maintains that  it is entitled to  judgment on\r\n\nthe discrimination claims because there was insufficient evidence\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nthat  its proffered  reason for  denying Lattimore  continued STD\r\n\nstatus  and  later  terminating his  employment  was  pretextual.\r\n\nFinally, Polaroid asserts that the Title VII discrimination claim\r\n\nfails due to the absence of any evidence of discriminatory intent\r\n\non the part of Polaroid.\r\n\n                      I.

In  sex discrimination\r\n\ncases,  we have  recognized  that workplace  harassment may  take\r\n\neither of  two forms.   It may  consist of promises  of favorable\r\n\ntreatment or  threats  of  unfavorable  treatment  calculated  to\r\n\ncoerce an  employee into submitting to  unwelcome sexual advances\r\n\n(i.e.,  quid pro  quo harassment).

See,  e.g., Tart v. Hill  Behan Lumber Co., 31\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d 668, 672  (8th Cir.  1994). Thus, when  both harassment  and\r\n\n\"job status\"  discrimination claims  are made, they  are analyzed\r\n\nseparately.      See,   e.g.,   Lipsett,  864   F.2d   881   (sex\r                                                 \r\n\ndiscrimination);  Edwards v. Wallace  Community College,  49 F.3d\r                                                                 \r\n\n1517  (11th Cir.  1993)  (race  discrimination).   A  job  status\r\n\ndiscrimination  claim is  not converted  into a  harassment claim\r\n\nsimply because it is labeled as such.\r\n\n          In this case, Lattimore's harassment claims are hostile\r\n\nwork environment  claims.  Moreover, although  the administrative\r\n\ncharge relating  to the denial of  workers' compensation benefits\r\n\nand continued STD status  uses the word \"harassment,\"  that label\r\n\ndoes  not alter  the fact  that the  harassment claims  are based\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nentirely upon the  comments allegedly made  by Mitchell and  upon\r\n\nthe allegation  that Mitchell coerced Lattimore  to perform tasks\r\n\ninconsistent with  his medical restriction.   Clearly the alleged\r\n\nharassment must  have  occurred  on or  before  March  16,  1989,\r\n\nbecause that is when Lattimore ceased work and, therefore, was no\r\n\nlonger  subject  to  any  hostile  work  environment.    That  is\r\n\nconfirmed  by Lattimore's  brief which  describes  the harassment\r\n\nclaims  as  being  \"for  the  March  1989  events  which  led  to\r\n\nLattimore's total disability.\"  Appellee's Br. at 2.\r\n\n          Polaroid does not seriously question  whether the March\r\n\n1989 conduct  alleged by  Lattimore was  so severe  and pervasive\r\n\nthat it created a hostile work environment.  Polaroid's principal\r\n\nargument is that  the harassment claims  are barred because  they\r\n\nare  beyond  the  scope  of the  administrative  charge  filed by\r\n\nLattimore.\r\n\n          Both Title VII and Chapter 151B  require an employee to\r\n\nfile an administrative  charge as a prerequisite to  commencing a\r\n\ncivil  action for  employment discrimination.   See  42 U.S.C.   \r                                                             \r\n\n2000e-5(f); Mass. Gen. L. ch. 151B,    5-9.  The  purpose of that\r\n\nrequirement  is to provide the employer with prompt notice of the\r\n\nclaim and to create  an opportunity for early conciliation.

Nor does it  entitle the complainant to\r\n\nmake  a specific  claim based  on one  set of  facts and,  later,\r\n\nassert  an entirely  different  claim based  on  a different  and\r\n\nunrelated set of facts.  Pickney, 568 F. Supp. at 690.\r                                          \r\n\n          In this case, Lattimore's administrative charge plainly\r\n\nand  specifically  describes   his  claim  to  be   that  he  was\r\n\ndiscriminated against because, unlike  white workers who had been\r\n\ninjured and  applied for  workers' compensation benefits,  he was\r\n\ndirected to return to work and  was fired when he refused.  Those\r\n\nallegations   relate  solely  to  employment  decisions  made  by\r                                                                 \r\n\nPolaroid after Lattimore's March  16 injury and cannot reasonably\r                        \r\n\nbe  construed  to  include  any  harassment  by  Mitchell  before\r                                                                           \r\n\nLattimore's injury.\r\n\n          Indeed,  there are  indications that  Lattimore himself\r\n\ndid not  consider the events occurring before March 16 to be part\r\n\nof  his  administrative  charge.    The  pro  se  complaint  that\r                                                          \r\n\nLattimore filed in  the District Court nearly  three years later,\r\n\nalthough  more detailed  than  the  administrative  charge,  also\r\n\nfocused  entirely on Lattimore's removal  from STD status and his\r\n\nsubsequent termination which he attributed to his application for\r\n\nworkers' compensation  benefits and the  fact that he  was black.\r\n\nLike the administrative  charge, it  failed to  mention any  pre-\r\n\ninjury harassment by Mitchell or anyone else.  That claim was not\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\nraised until ten months later when an amended complaint was filed\r\n\nby Lattimore's counsel.\r\n\n          For many  of the reasons already  mentioned, we further\r\n\nfind that the  harassment claims were  not reasonably within  the\r\n\nscope of  an agency investigation  of Lattimore's  administrative\r\n\ncharge.    An  investigation  is  a  systematic  inquiry  into  a\r\n\nparticular matter.  When it  is launched in response to  a charge\r\n\nof  employment discrimination,  the  direction and  scope of  the\r\n\ninvestigation  are guided  by  the allegations  contained in  the\r\n\ncharge.  Although  an investigation is  not strictly confined  to\r\n\nallegations  in the charge, it is not a \"fishing expedition\" that\r\n\nshould be expected to extend to matters unrelated to the charge.\r\n\n          Here,  Lattimore's  charge focused  exclusively  on his\r\n\ntermination  and  the  events leading  up  to  it,  all of  which\r\n\noccurred  after his  injury.   It contains no  hint of  any claim\r\n\nthat, before his  injury, Lattimore was  harassed by Mitchell  or\r\n\nanyone else.  It makes no mention of Mitchell or any incidents of\r\n\nharassment.\r\n\n          The two claims are based upon different facts that  are\r\n\nseparate  and distinct  both  qualitatively and  temporally.   In\r\n\naddition, they  relate to  the conduct of  different individuals.\r\n\nThe record indicates that the decision to discontinue Lattimore's\r\n\nSTD  status  was  made by  the  Board  and  that the  termination\r\n\ndecision  was made  by  Montes after  consulting with  Polaroid's\r\n\nhuman resources department.   On the other hand, it  was Mitchell\r\n\nwho  engaged  in  the  alleged  harassment.    Therefore,  it  is\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\ndifficult  to   see  how  Mitchell's  conduct   before  March  16\r\n\nreasonably  could  be  expected to  be  within  the  scope of  an\r\n\nagency's investigation of the charge.  See Tart,  31 F.3d at 672-\r                                                         \r\n\n73.\r\n\n          Our  finding in  this  regard is  buttressed by  MCAD's\r\n\nNotice of  Final Disposition which  indicates that, in  fact, its\r\n\ninvestigation  did  not  extend  to  any  alleged  harassment  by\r\n\nMitchell.    MCAD's  findings focus  exclusively  on  Lattimore's\r\n\ntermination  and do not include  any reference to  claims of pre-\r\n\ninjury harassment.\r\n\n          Having  decided that the  harassment claims  are beyond\r\n\nthe scope of Lattimore's  administrative charge, we conclude that\r\n\njudgment  as  a  matter of  law  should  be entered  in  favor of\r\n\nPolaroid with respect to the  harassment claims made pursuant  to\r\n\nboth Title VII and  Chapter 151B.  Accordingly, there  is no need\r\n\nfor  us  to  consider Polaroid's  arguments  that  the Title  VII\r\n\nharassment  claim fails due to  the absence of  any evidence that\r\n\nPolaroid  knew or  should have  known of  the alleged  harassment\r\n\nand/or that the Chapter 151B harassment claim is time barred.\r\n\n            III.

First, the  employee must\r\n\nprove a prima facie  case by demonstrating that he or she belongs\r                             \r\n\nto  a protected class  and was denied a  position or benefits for\r\n\nwhich  the employee was qualified.  The burden then shifts to the\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\nemployer to  present a  legitimate non-discriminatory  reason for\r\n\nits  action.    If that  is  done,  the employee  is  afforded an\r\n\nopportunity  to prove  that the  proffered reason  is pretextual.\r\n\nSee McDonnell Douglas Corp.  v.

Polaroid also argues that the Title VII claim fails\r\n\nfor  the  additional reason  that there  was  no evidence  of any\r\n\ndiscriminatory intent on the part of Polaroid.\r\n\n                     A.  The Prima Facie Case\r                               A.  The Prima Facie Case\r                                                       \r\n\n          Ordinarily, when  a claim of  discriminatory firing  is\r\n\nmade, the \"qualified\"  prong of the  employee's prima facie  case\r                                                                     \r\n\nconsists of proof that the employee was adequately performing the\r\n\njob in question.  However, this case is somewhat atypical because\r\n\nLattimore does not claim that he  was fired despite being able to\r\n\nwork.   Instead, Lattimore claims  that he was  denied STD status\r\n\neven though he was physically unable to work and that the loss of\r                                          \r\n\nSTD status resulted in his termination.  Consequently, the  issue\r\n\nis whether  Lattimore's evidence was  sufficient to make  a prima\r                                                                           \r\n\nfacie showing that he was qualified for STD status.\r               \r\n\n          Under  Polaroid's  STD  policy,  an  employee  must  be\r\n\ntotally disabled from performing his or her job or any other work\r                 \r\n\noffered by  the company in order  to qualify for STD  status.  As\r\n\nalready   noted,  an  employee   may  establish   eligibility  by\r\n\nsubmitting  periodic reports  from a  physician stating  that the\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\nemployee is disabled.  If the Medical Review Board disagrees with\r\n\nthe physician's opinion,  it may  require an IME  to resolve  the\r\n\ndispute.\r\n\n          Polaroid  argues  that  the  record is  devoid  of  any\r\n\nevidence that Lattimore was \"totally\" disabled.  That argument is\r\n\nbased  principally on  testimony by  Dr. Hillier  conceding that,\r\n\nnotwithstanding  his previous  reports to  Polaroid  stating that\r\n\nLattimore  was totally  disabled, Lattimore  was able  to perform\r\n\nlimited forms of  light duty work at the time  his STD status was\r\n\ndiscontinued.\r\n\n          However,  contrary  to   Polaroid's  contention,   that\r\n\ntestimony  does not  negate  Dr. Hillier's  previously  expressed\r\n\nopinion that, in August  of 1989, Lattimore was \"disabled.\"   Nor\r\n\ndoes it preclude a finding that Lattimore  was \"totally disabled\"\r\n\nwithin the meaning of Polaroid's STD policy.\r\n\n          It is  clear that, both  in August  of 1989 and  at the\r\n\ntime of trial, Dr.  Hillier considered Lattimore totally disabled\r\n\nfrom  performing  his  usual  job and  felt  it  inadvisable  for\r\n\nLattimore to work at all.  The fact that Dr.  Hillier also viewed\r\n\nLattimore as capable of performing some light duty tasks does not\r\n\nundercut that opinion.   Furthermore, Dr. Hillier's assessment is\r\n\nperfectly  compatible with  Polaroid's own  definition of  \"total\r\n\ndisability\" because on August 23, when Lattimore  was directed to\r\n\nreturn to work, he  was told that, after two weeks of unspecified\r\n\nlight duty, he would  be expected to work without  restriction of\r\n\nany  kind.  Thus, Lattimore was not offered work that Dr. Hillier\r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\nconsidered him able to perform.\r\n\n          Moreover, in  addition to  Dr. Hillier's  testimony and\r\n\nreports,  there was testimony from Lattimore  himself that he was\r\n\nphysically  unable to  do any  work because  of his  back injury.\r\n\nThus,  there  was sufficient  evidence  to  establish the  \"total\r\n\ndisability\"  element  of  Lattimore's  prima  facie  case.    Any\r                                                             \r\n\nconflict between that evidence  and conflicting medical  evidence\r\n\npresented by Polaroid, in rebuttal, was  a matter for the jury to\r\n\nresolve.\r\n\n                           B.  Pretext\r                                     B.  Pretext\r                                                \r\n\n          Lattimore's   effort   to   prove   pretext   consisted\r\n\nprincipally of   evidence that,  in discontinuing his  STD status\r\n\nand later terminating his  employment, Polaroid deviated from its\r\n\nestablished  policies and  practices.   Polaroid argues  that any\r\n\nsuch  irregularities were  insufficient, as  a matter of  law, to\r\n\nprove pretext.\r\n\n          Most of  the \"deviations\" cited by  Lattimore amount to\r\n\nlittle more  than quibbling  over semantics (e.g.,  whether there\r\n\nwas  a  \"disagreement\"  between  Polaroid and  Dr.  Hillier  that\r\n\njustified Polaroid's  request for  an IME).   However,  there was\r\n\nevidence from which a  jury reasonably could have found  that the\r\n\ndecision to  discontinue Lattimore's  STD status was  made before\r\n\nthe Medical Review Board  had obtained the results of  Dr. Ramos'\r\n\nIME.  As already  noted, Dr. Ramos' report  was not issued  until\r\n\napproximately one  week after the Board's  decision and Williams'\r                                       \r\n\ntestimony  that  he  learned  of  the  results  via  a  telephone\r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\nconversation with Dr. Ramos,  was contradicted by Dr. Ramos.   In\r\n\naddition,  Vincent Pina,  a  Polaroid  director, testified  that,\r\n\nunder Polaroid's STD policy, it was unimaginable that an employee\r\n\nwho had provided physicians' reports indicating  disability would\r\n\nbe  removed from  STD status  before the  Board reviewed  the IME\r\n\nresults.\r\n\n          There, also, was evidence  suggesting that the  results\r\n\nof the  IME may have been preordained.  If a jury determined that\r\n\nWilliams never talked with Dr. Ramos about his findings, it could\r\n\ninfer  that, in  alluding  to those  findings  in his  August  23\r\n\nletter, Williams must  have known,  in advance of  the IME,  what\r\n\nthose  findings were going to be.  Lattimore's testimony that the\r\n\nexamination  was  a perfunctory  one,  although  disputed by  Dr.\r\n\nRamos,  and the  evidence  that Dr.  Ramos  did not  perform  any\r\n\ndiagnostic  examinations or  review  Lattimore's medical  records\r\n\ncould provide additional support for such an inference.\r\n\n          In  short, although  the evidence  of pretext  is thin,\r\n\ndisputed  and  susceptible  to  varying  interpretations,  it  is\r\n\nsufficient  to  create  a  jury  question.    Accordingly,  since\r\n\nMassachusetts  law provides  that  an employee  may prevail  upon\r\n\nproof  of pretext,  alone,  the District  Court  did not  err  in\r\n\ndenying  Polaroid's motion for judgment  as a matter  of law with\r\n\nrespect to the Chapter 151B claim.\r\n\n                    C.  Discriminatory Intent\r                              C.  Discriminatory Intent\r                                                       \r\n\n          As already noted, Title VII requires proof of something\r\n\nmore  than pretext.   It  also  requires proof  of discriminatory\r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\nintent.     Polaroid argues  that there is  no evidence that  its\r\n\ndecisions  to  discontinue  Lattimore's STD  status  and,  later,\r\n\nterminate his employment,  were motivated  by any  discriminatory\r\n\nintent.  We agree.\r\n\n          Lattimore's claim  of  discriminatory intent  is  based\r\n\nentirely  upon  allegations that  Mitchell  was  involved in  the\r\n\ndecisions  and  upon the  fact  that  Polaroid's human  resources\r\n\nadministrator  was called to the scene when Lattimore returned to\r\n\nthe  plant  on  August 24  and  the  discussion  between him  and\r\n\nWilliams apparently became heated.\r\n\n          As already noted, Polaroid presented evidence  that the\r\n\ndecisions at  issue were made  by the Board  and by Montes.    In\r\n\nsupport  of his  assertion  that Mitchell  participated in  those\r\n\ndecisions, Lattimore  cites evidence  that, until shortly  before\r\n\nLattimore's termination, Mitchell retained custody of Lattimore's\r\n\ntime cards and received  copies of all medical  reports regarding\r\n\nLattimore's physical condition.   However, that evidence does not\r\n\ntend  to  prove  anything  other  than  that  Mitchell  may  have\r\n\ncontinued  to be  Lattimore's  \"supervisor\" during  that  period.\r\n\nThat fact,  alone, has little significance  inasmuch as Lattimore\r\n\nwas  out of  work and  not being  supervised.   By itself,  it is\r\n\ninsufficient  to support  a  reasonable  inference that  Mitchell\r\n\nparticipated,  in any way,  in the  decision to  remove Lattimore\r\n\nfrom STD status or  to fire him.  Nor  does it provide any  basis\r\n\nfor concluding  that any  alleged racial prejudice  on Mitchell's\r\n\npart infected those decisions.\r\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\n          Similarly,   the   fact   that  Florence   Ramos-Jones,\r\n\nPolaroid's   human   resources   administrator,   was   asked  to\r\n\nparticipate in  the discussion with  Lattimore on August  24 does\r\n\nnot establish  any reasonable ground for  finding that Polaroid's\r\n\ndecision was motivated by racial animus.   Lattimore argues that,\r\n\nbecause   Ms.  Ramos-Jones   dealt  with  \"racial   issues,\"  her\r\n\nparticipation   is  evidence  that  Polaroid  viewed  Lattimore's\r\n\ntermination  as  a  \"racial matter.\"      However,  there was  no\r\n\nevidence regarding  why Ms.  Ramos-Jones became involved  in that\r\n\ndiscussion.    If,  for  example,  she  became  involved  because\r\n\nLattimore,  himself,  raised the  question  of  racial bias,  her\r\n\nparticipation  would not  provide  any basis  for inferring  that\r\n\nPolaroid's decision was discriminatory.\r\n\n          In  the absence  of any  evidence  regarding Mitchell's\r\n\ninvolvement in the termination decisions or the circumstances and\r\n\nnature  of  Ms.  Ramos-Jones'  participation  in  the  August  24\r\n\ndiscussion, there  is no  justification for the  inferential leap\r\n\nurged  by  Lattimore.   Submitting  the  issue of  discriminatory\r\n\nintent to a jury on this record would amount to nothing more than\r\n\nan invitation to  speculate.  Therefore, Polaroid  is entitled to\r\n\njudgment  as  a   matter  of   law  on  the   Title  VII   status\r\n\ndiscrimination claim.\r\n\n                          IV.  New Trial\r                                    IV.

We answer that question in the affirmative because it\r\n\nis impossible to ascertain  whether or to what extent  the jury's\r\n\nverdict was based on the three flawed claims.\r\n\n          As already  noted, the  only document completed  by the\r\n\njury was a  one page  \"jury questionnaire\" that  called upon  the\r\n\njury to  answer three questions.   Those questions  asked whether\r\n\nLattimore was harassed; whether  any such harassment  proximately\r\n\ncaused injury  to him and,  if so,  the amount of  damages to  be\r\n\nawarded.   See  Appendix A.   Because  the document  was entitled\r                        \r\n\n\"questionnaire\" rather than \"verdict\" and because it consisted of\r\n\nnothing  more than \"written  questions susceptible of categorical\r\n\nor  other brief  answer\" (Fed.  R.  Civ. P.  49(a)), we  view the\r\n\njury's response as a \"special verdict\" within the meaning of Rule\r\n\n49(a).\r\n\n          In  any  event,  under those  circumstances,  it  makes\r\n\nlittle  difference whether  the  response is  characterized as  a\r\n\ngeneral  or  special  verdict.   It  is  settled  law that,  when\r\n\nmultiple  claims are  submitted  to a  jury  and only  a  general\r\n\nverdict  is returned,  a new  trial is  required if  some of  the\r\n\nclaims   should  not   have   been  submitted   and  the   jury's\r\n\nconsideration  of those  claims  may have  affected the  verdict.\r\n\nSunkist Growers, Inc.  v.

A new\r\n\n                               -24-\r\r\n\ntrial  ordinarily  is required  when  a  special verdict  finding\r\n\nencompasses multiple  facts and claims  some of which  should not\r\n\nhave  been  submitted  to  the  jury.    In either  case,  it  is\r\n\nimpossible  to  tell  whether  consideration  of  the  improperly\r\n\nsubmitted claims may have affected the verdict.\r\n\n          In this  case, we believe  the jury's verdict  may have\r\n\nbeen affected  by its consideration of  the erroneously submitted\r\n\nclaims.    If  the  finding  that  Lattimore  was  \"harassed\"  is\r\n\nconstrued to mean that the jury found for Lattimore solely on the\r\n\nbasis of the harassment claims, the verdict was based entirely on\r\n\nthose  claims.   Alternatively,  if the  finding of  \"harassment\"\r\n\nresulted from  consideration of both  the harassment and  the job\r\n\nstatus  discrimination claims,3   there  is no  way  to determine\r\n\nwhether or  to  what extent  the harassment  claims affected  the\r\n\nverdict.

Polaroid  contends that  the District  Court\r\n\nerred  in denying  Polaroid's motions  for summary  judgment, for\r\n\njudgment  as a matter  of law  and for a  new trial.   Because we\r\n\nconclude that  the motion for judgment as  a matter of law should\r\n\nhave  been granted with respect to some of Lattimore's claims and\r\n\nbecause it appears  that the  jury's verdict may  have rested  on\r\n\nthose claims, we vacate the judgment and remand for a new trial.\r\n\n                        Factual Background\r                                  Factual Background\r                                                    \r\n\n          Ollie Lattimore, a black man, was hired  by Polaroid in\r\n\n1977 as a machine operator.  During part of Lattimore's tenure at\r\n\nPolaroid,  his supervisor  was Bill  Mitchell, a  white man.   In\r\n\n1978,    Lattimore  sustained  a  job-related  back  injury  that\r\n\nresulted  in his  being placed  on a  \"medical restriction\"  that\r\n\nlimited  his  duties to  tasks  that did  not  require repetitive\r\n\nbending, twisting  or lifting objects weighing  more than fifteen\r\n\npounds.   The restriction was  renewed each year  until 1989 and,\r\n\nbecause of it, Lattimore was assigned to light-duty work.\r\n\n          At trial,  Lattimore testified that, in  March of 1989,\r\n\nMitchell assigned  him to certain janitorial  tasks that required\r\n\nheavier  lifting.   When  Lattimore  protested  that his  medical\r\n\nrestriction prevented  him from performing  those tasks, Mitchell\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nallegedly replied, \"I'm  sick of  you people all  the time  lazy,\r\n\ntrying to skip work.  There is the door.  Don't let it hit you in\r\n\nthe ass.\"  Lattimore  interpreted the statement as a  racial slur\r\n\nand stated that  he began  doing the janitorial  work because  he\r\n\nfeared  for his job.  Mitchell denied asking Lattimore to perform\r\n\ntasks  prohibited  by his  medical  restriction  and also  denied\r\n\nmaking the statement attributed to him.\r\n\n          According  to  Lattimore, on  March  16,  1989, he  re-\r\n\ninjured his back while emptying a barrel into a dumpster.   Later\r\n\nthat day,  he was seen by  Dr. Hillier, a physician  who had been\r\n\ntreating him  for his  pre-existing back  problems.   Dr. Hillier\r\n\nprovided  Lattimore with the first in a series of reports stating\r\n\nthat  Lattimore  was  disabled  from  returning  to  work.    The\r\n\nfollowing  day, Lattimore  presented the  report to  Mitchell who\r\n\nallegedly  said,  \"I'm  getting sick  and  tired  of  you people.\r\n\nYou're  all  lazy all  the time.\"    Mitchell denied  making that\r\n\nstatement, too.\r\n\n          In any event, Polaroid immediately placed  Lattimore on\r\n\nshort-term disability  (\"STD\") status pursuant  to the  company's\r\n\nshort-term disability policy.  Under  that policy, an employee is\r\n\neligible for  STD benefits if  medical reports  submitted by  the\r\n\nemployee's  treating physician  support the  conclusion that  the\r\n\nemployee is totally disabled.   The policy further provides  that\r\n\nin the event that  Polaroid's Medical Review Board (\"the  Board\")\r\n\ndisagrees  with  the  assessment  by  the  employee's  physician,\r\n\nPolaroid may require an independent medical examination  (\"IME\"),\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nthe  results of which will  be deemed conclusive  with respect to\r\n\nthe employee's ability to work.\r\n\n          Approximately twelve weeks after Lattimore was accorded\r\n\nSTD status,  Dr. Kantrowitz, Polaroid's medical  director and the\r\n\nchairman  of the Medical Review Board, spoke to Dr. Hillier about\r\n\nLattimore's condition.  Dr.  Hillier indicated that Lattimore was\r\n\nimproving and  should be able to return to work  on July 24 if an\r\n\nexamination  scheduled  for  July  21 showed  the  progress  that\r\n\nDr. Hillier anticipated.\r\n\n          After subsequently receiving a report  from Dr. Hillier\r\n\nlisting Lattimore's condition as \"undetermined\" and learning that\r\n\nthe examination  scheduled for July  21 had been  postponed until\r\n\nAugust 8, the Board decided to require an IME without waiting for\r\n\nthe results of Dr. Hillier's  examination.  Polaroid claims  that\r\n\nthe Board's  decision was based  on ambiguities in  Dr. Hillier's\r\n\nreports and on  the results  of a July  13 workers'  compensation\r\n\nexamination performed  by Dr. James Dolphin  which indicated that\r\n\nLattimore  was  able to  perform  light  work.   Apparently,  Dr.\r\n\nDolphin's  findings had  caused Lattimore  to be  denied workers'\r\n\ncompensation benefits.\r\n\n          The Board gave Lattimore  the opportunity to select one\r\n\nof three \"independent\" physicians to conduct the IME and he chose\r\n\nDr. Marcos Ramos.  The IME was performed on August 23.  According\r\n\nto  Lattimore, the examination was very brief and did not include\r\n\nany  diagnostic tests.  Dr.  Ramos, on the  other hand, indicated\r\n\nthat the  examination was  thorough and lasted  approximately one\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nand one-half hours.\r\n\n          The   following   day,  Richard   Williams,  Polaroid's\r\n\ncorporate  benefits administrator,  informed  Lattimore that  Dr.\r\n\nRamos  had determined  that Lattimore  was not  totally disabled;\r\n\nthat he could return  to light-duty work immediately and  that he\r\n\ncould  resume full  duties in  two weeks.   Accordingly, Williams\r\n\ninstructed  Lattimore to return to  work the next  day.  Although\r\n\nWilliams'  statements  regarding  Dr.  Ramos'   conclusions  were\r\n\nconsistent  with the  findings  contained in  Dr. Ramos'  written\r\n\nreport, the report was not issued until one week later.  Williams\r\n\nsought  to explain  this  by testifying  that  the findings  were\r\n\nrelated  to him during a telephone conversation with Dr. Ramos on\r\n\nAugust 23.  However,  Dr. Ramos had no  recollection of any  such\r\n\nconversation.\r\n\n          Matters came to a head when Lattimore refused to return\r\n\nto  work  asserting  that he  still  was  totally  disabled.   On\r\n\nSeptember 9, Lattimore's  employment  was terminated.    Polaroid\r\n\npresented evidence  that the  decision was  made by  Eddy Montes,\r\n\nLattimore's new  supervisor, based  upon the company's  policy of\r\n\nterminating  employees who  refused to  work after  being removed\r\n\nfrom STD status.\r\n\n                        Procedural History\r                                  Procedural History\r                                                    \r\n\n          On  October   27,  1989,  Lattimore  filed   a  written\r\n\nadministrative charge  with the Massachusetts  Commission Against\r\n\nDiscrimination (\"MCAD\") and with the Equal Employment Opportunity\r\n\nCommission  (\"EEOC\").   The  charge  recited  that Lattimore  had\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nsustained a  back injury  on March 16,  1989, and  had filed  for\r\n\nworker's  compensation benefits on June 26, 1989.   It went on to\r\n\nstate that he was later fired for refusing to return to work even\r\n\nthough his back injury  rendered him totally disabled.   Based on\r\n\nthat account of the pertinent events, Lattimore alleged that:\r\n\n            Respondent does not  treat white  workers\r\n            who  are handicapped  and have  filed for\r                                                               \r\n            workers  compensation  the way  they have\r                                           \r\n            treated  me.     Ray  (Lnu),   a  machine\r\n            operator  in my department,  has been out\r\n            on  workers comp  numerous times  and has\r\n            not  been harassed  and fired  as I  have\r\n            been.  I believe  I was fired and treated\r\n            differently due to my race, black, and my\r\n            handicap,  back injury,  . .  . (emphasis\r\n            added).\r\n\n          After investigating  and finding no  probable cause  to\r\n\nbelieve  that Polaroid  had discriminated against  Lattimore, the\r\n\nMCAD  dismissed the  charge.    The  EEOC  did  not  conduct  any\r\n\nindependent investigation but accepted  MCAD's finding and issued\r\n\nLattimore a right-to-sue letter on March 24, 1992.\r\n\n          On June  22, 1992, Lattimore, acting  pro se, commenced\r                                                                \r\n\nthis  action in  the  District Court.    His complaint  was  more\r\n\ndetailed than  the administrative charge  but covered essentially\r\n\nthe same  ground.  It alluded  to the March 16  back injury which\r\n\nLattimore  attributed to  being assigned  to  duties inconsistent\r\n\nwith his medical restriction.   It also stated that,  after being\r\n\nplaced on STD status, Lattimore was wrongfully  removed from that\r\n\nstatus when  he applied  for workers' compensation  benefits that\r\n\nwould have  supplemented his  disability payments.   Finally, the\r\n\ncomplaint  referred to  Lattimore's  termination for  refusing to\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nreturn to work  despite his claim  that he was  unable to do  so.\r\n\nLike  the administrative  charge,  the  complaint asserted  that,\r\n\nbecause  of his race, Lattimore  was denied benefits  to which he\r\n\nwas entitled.  More specifically, it stated:\r\n\n            I  believe that  the Polaroid  Corp. used\r\n            the fact  that I was an  uneducated black\r\n            to  hinder my every effort to receive the\r\n            compensation  which  was   due  me   both\r\n            through  the Workmen's  Compensation laws\r\n            and  the Company's  Short  Term and  Long\r\n            Term Disability programs.\r\n\n          Nine months  later, after retaining  counsel, Lattimore\r\n\namended his  complaint.   The  amended complaint,  for the  first\r\n\ntime,  alleged that, on  unspecified occasions  after Lattimore's\r\n\n1979 back  injury, \"supervisors  and other employees  at Polaroid\r\n\nharassed  . . .  [him] . .  . about  his handicap\"  and that such\r\n\nharassment  was  \"coupled  with verbal  reference  to Lattimore's\r\n\nrace.\"\r\n\n          The amended complaint contained five counts asserting a\r\n\nvariety of claims for both handicap and race discrimination.  The\r\n\nDistrict Court  granted  Polaroid's motion  for summary  judgment\r\n\nwith respect  to three of the  counts but denied the  motion with\r\n\nrespect to  the other two counts.  The case proceeded to trial on\r\n\nthose  two counts  which  encompassed four  claims:   (1)  racial\r\n\nharassment by co-employees  in violation of Title VII; (2) racial\r\n\nharassment by co-employees in violation of Chapter 151B; (3) race\r\n\ndiscrimination regarding terms  and conditions  of employment  in\r\n\nviolation  of Title  VII; and  (4) race  discrimination regarding\r\n\nterms and conditions of employment in violation of Chapter 151B.\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\n          During trial,  evidence was  presented relating  to all\r\n\nfour claims.  That evidence included testimony about the comments\r\n\nallegedly made by Mitchell on or before March 16 and how Mitchell\r\n\nallegedly  coerced  Lattimore into  performing  work inconsistent\r\n\nwith his medical restriction thereby causing the March 16 injury.\r\n\nAt the conclusion of Lattimore's case and, again, at the close of\r\n\nthe evidence, Polaroid moved for judgment as a matter of law with\r\n\nrespect to all  four claims.  The grounds for  those motions were\r\n\nessentially the  same as  the grounds  relied upon  in Polaroid's\r\n\nprevious  motion for  summary  judgment.    Like the  motion  for\r\n\nsummary judgment, the  motions for  judgment as a  matter of  law\r\n\nwere denied.\r\n\n          The District Judge  charged the jury on all four claims\r\n\nbut  a  questionnaire  submitted  to  the  jury  asked  only  for\r\n\ndeterminations  of  whether  Lattimore was  \"racially  harassed,\"\r\n\nwhether any such harassment proximately caused injury and, if so,\r\n\nthe amount of damages to be awarded.1  See Appendix A.2  The jury\r                                                    \r\n\nanswered the  first two  questions in  the affirmative  and fixed\r\n\ndamages at $400,000.\r\n\n          After denying  Polaroid's motion  for a new  trial, the\r\n\nDistrict Court  entered judgment for  Lattimore in the  amount of\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1     Polaroid's   counsel  did   raise  an   objection  to   the\r\nquestionnaire, but that objection appeared to be directed only to\r\nthe  time frame  during  which the  alleged  harassment may  have\r\noccurred.\r\n\n2   In his brief,  Lattimore's counsel erroneously  describes the\r\nquestionnaire    as    asking   whether    Polaroid   \"unlawfully\r\ndiscriminated.\"  Appellee's Br. at 3.\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\n$562,000  representing  the  damages   fixed  by  the  jury  plus\r\n\ninterest.  It is from that judgment that Polaroid appeals.\r\n\n          In its appeal, Polaroid asserts that the District Court\r\n\nerred in  denying Polaroid's  motion for summary  judgment and/or\r\n\njudgment as a matter of law  and in denying Polaroid's motion for\r\n\na new trial.  Our analysis  is limited to reviewing the denial of\r\n\nthe   motion  for  judgment  as  a  matter  of  law  because  the\r\n\nconclusions we reach render the remaining claims of error moot.\r\n\n                            Discussion\r                                      Discussion\r                                                \r\n\n          Polaroid argues  that it was entitled to  judgment as a\r\n\nmatter  of law on the harassment claims asserted under both Title\r\n\nVII and Chapter 151B  because those claims were beyond  the scope\r\n\nof Lattimore's  administrative charge.    Polaroid also  contends\r\n\nthat judgment in its favor should have been entered regarding the\r\n\nTitle VII harassment claim because Lattimore provided no evidence\r\n\nthat  Polaroid  knew  or   should  have  known  of   the  alleged\r\n\nharassment.   Finally,  Polaroid  asserts that  the Chapter  151B\r\n\nharassment claim is barred  because the administrative charge was\r\n\nnot filed  within the period of time  prescribed by Massachusetts\r\n\nlaw.\r\n\n          With  respect  to  the discrimination  claims  Polaroid\r\n\nargues  that  Lattimore failed  to establish a  prima facie  case\r                                                                     \r\n\nbecause  he presented no evidence that he was totally disabled, a\r\n\nsine  qua  non  of eligibility  for  continued  STD  status.   In\r                        \r\n\naddition, Polaroid maintains that  it is entitled to  judgment on\r\n\nthe discrimination claims because there was insufficient evidence\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nthat  its proffered  reason for  denying Lattimore  continued STD\r\n\nstatus  and  later  terminating his  employment  was  pretextual.\r\n\nFinally, Polaroid asserts that the Title VII discrimination claim\r\n\nfails due to the absence of any evidence of discriminatory intent\r\n\non the part of Polaroid.\r\n\n                      I.

A  job  status\r\n\ndiscrimination  claim is  not converted  into a  harassment claim\r\n\nsimply because it is labeled as such.\r\n\n          In this case, Lattimore's harassment claims are hostile\r\n\nwork environment  claims.  Moreover, although  the administrative\r\n\ncharge relating  to the denial of  workers' compensation benefits\r\n\nand continued STD status  uses the word \"harassment,\"  that label\r\n\ndoes  not alter  the fact  that the  harassment claims  are based\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nentirely upon the  comments allegedly made  by Mitchell and  upon\r\n\nthe allegation  that Mitchell coerced Lattimore  to perform tasks\r\n\ninconsistent with  his medical restriction.   Clearly the alleged\r\n\nharassment must  have  occurred  on or  before  March  16,  1989,\r\n\nbecause that is when Lattimore ceased work and, therefore, was no\r\n\nlonger  subject  to  any  hostile  work  environment.    That  is\r\n\nconfirmed  by Lattimore's  brief which  describes  the harassment\r\n\nclaims  as  being  \"for  the  March  1989  events  which  led  to\r\n\nLattimore's total disability.\"  Appellee's Br. at 2.\r\n\n          Polaroid does not seriously question  whether the March\r\n\n1989 conduct  alleged by  Lattimore was  so severe  and pervasive\r\n\nthat it created a hostile work environment.  Polaroid's principal\r\n\nargument is that  the harassment claims  are barred because  they\r\n\nare  beyond  the  scope  of the  administrative  charge  filed by\r\n\nLattimore.\r\n\n          Both Title VII and Chapter 151B  require an employee to\r\n\nfile an administrative  charge as a prerequisite to  commencing a\r\n\ncivil  action for  employment discrimination.

Those\r\n\nallegations   relate  solely  to  employment  decisions  made  by\r                                                                 \r\n\nPolaroid after Lattimore's March  16 injury and cannot reasonably\r                        \r\n\nbe  construed  to  include  any  harassment  by  Mitchell  before\r                                                                           \r\n\nLattimore's injury.\r\n\n          Indeed,  there are  indications that  Lattimore himself\r\n\ndid not  consider the events occurring before March 16 to be part\r\n\nof  his  administrative  charge.    The  pro  se  complaint  that\r                                                          \r\n\nLattimore filed in  the District Court nearly  three years later,\r\n\nalthough  more detailed  than  the  administrative  charge,  also\r\n\nfocused  entirely on Lattimore's removal  from STD status and his\r\n\nsubsequent termination which he attributed to his application for\r\n\nworkers' compensation  benefits and the  fact that he  was black.\r\n\nLike the administrative  charge, it  failed to  mention any  pre-\r\n\ninjury harassment by Mitchell or anyone else.  That claim was not\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\nraised until ten months later when an amended complaint was filed\r\n\nby Lattimore's counsel.\r\n\n          For many  of the reasons already  mentioned, we further\r\n\nfind that the  harassment claims were  not reasonably within  the\r\n\nscope of  an agency investigation  of Lattimore's  administrative\r\n\ncharge.    An  investigation  is  a  systematic  inquiry  into  a\r\n\nparticular matter.  When it  is launched in response to  a charge\r\n\nof  employment discrimination,  the  direction and  scope of  the\r\n\ninvestigation  are guided  by  the allegations  contained in  the\r\n\ncharge.  Although  an investigation is  not strictly confined  to\r\n\nallegations  in the charge, it is not a \"fishing expedition\" that\r\n\nshould be expected to extend to matters unrelated to the charge.\r\n\n          Here,  Lattimore's  charge focused  exclusively  on his\r\n\ntermination  and  the  events leading  up  to  it,  all of  which\r\n\noccurred  after his  injury.   It contains no  hint of  any claim\r\n\nthat, before his  injury, Lattimore was  harassed by Mitchell  or\r\n\nanyone else.  It makes no mention of Mitchell or any incidents of\r\n\nharassment.\r\n\n          The two claims are based upon different facts that  are\r\n\nseparate  and distinct  both  qualitatively and  temporally.   In\r\n\naddition, they  relate to  the conduct of  different individuals.\r\n\nThe record indicates that the decision to discontinue Lattimore's\r\n\nSTD  status  was  made by  the  Board  and  that the  termination\r\n\ndecision  was made  by  Montes after  consulting with  Polaroid's\r\n\nhuman resources department.   On the other hand, it  was Mitchell\r\n\nwho  engaged  in  the  alleged  harassment.    Therefore,  it  is\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\ndifficult  to   see  how  Mitchell's  conduct   before  March  16\r\n\nreasonably  could  be  expected to  be  within  the  scope of  an\r\n\nagency's investigation of the charge.  See Tart,  31 F.3d at 672-\r                                                         \r\n\n73.\r\n\n          Our  finding in  this  regard is  buttressed by  MCAD's\r\n\nNotice of  Final Disposition which  indicates that, in  fact, its\r\n\ninvestigation  did  not  extend  to  any  alleged  harassment  by\r\n\nMitchell.    MCAD's  findings focus  exclusively  on  Lattimore's\r\n\ntermination  and do not include  any reference to  claims of pre-\r\n\ninjury harassment.\r\n\n          Having  decided that the  harassment claims  are beyond\r\n\nthe scope of Lattimore's  administrative charge, we conclude that\r\n\njudgment  as  a  matter of  law  should  be entered  in  favor of\r\n\nPolaroid with respect to the  harassment claims made pursuant  to\r\n\nboth Title VII and  Chapter 151B.  Accordingly, there  is no need\r\n\nfor  us  to  consider Polaroid's  arguments  that  the Title  VII\r\n\nharassment  claim fails due to  the absence of  any evidence that\r\n\nPolaroid  knew or  should have  known of  the alleged  harassment\r\n\nand/or that the Chapter 151B harassment claim is time barred.\r\n\n            III.

First, the  employee must\r\n\nprove a prima facie  case by demonstrating that he or she belongs\r                             \r\n\nto  a protected class  and was denied a  position or benefits for\r\n\nwhich  the employee was qualified.  The burden then shifts to the\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\nemployer to  present a  legitimate non-discriminatory  reason for\r\n\nits  action.    If that  is  done,  the employee  is  afforded an\r\n\nopportunity  to prove  that the  proffered reason  is pretextual.\r\n\nSee McDonnell Douglas Corp.  v.

Polaroid also argues that the Title VII claim fails\r\n\nfor  the  additional reason  that there  was  no evidence  of any\r\n\ndiscriminatory intent on the part of Polaroid.\r\n\n                     A.  The Prima Facie Case\r                               A.  The Prima Facie Case\r                                                       \r\n\n          Ordinarily, when  a claim of  discriminatory firing  is\r\n\nmade, the \"qualified\"  prong of the  employee's prima facie  case\r                                                                     \r\n\nconsists of proof that the employee was adequately performing the\r\n\njob in question.  However, this case is somewhat atypical because\r\n\nLattimore does not claim that he  was fired despite being able to\r\n\nwork.   Instead, Lattimore claims  that he was  denied STD status\r\n\neven though he was physically unable to work and that the loss of\r                                          \r\n\nSTD status resulted in his termination.  Consequently, the  issue\r\n\nis whether  Lattimore's evidence was  sufficient to make  a prima\r                                                                           \r\n\nfacie showing that he was qualified for STD status.\r               \r\n\n          Under  Polaroid's  STD  policy,  an  employee  must  be\r\n\ntotally disabled from performing his or her job or any other work\r                 \r\n\noffered by  the company in order  to qualify for STD  status.  As\r\n\nalready   noted,  an  employee   may  establish   eligibility  by\r\n\nsubmitting  periodic reports  from a  physician stating  that the\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\nemployee is disabled.  If the Medical Review Board disagrees with\r\n\nthe physician's opinion,  it may  require an IME  to resolve  the\r\n\ndispute.\r\n\n          Polaroid  argues  that  the  record is  devoid  of  any\r\n\nevidence that Lattimore was \"totally\" disabled.  That argument is\r\n\nbased  principally on  testimony by  Dr. Hillier  conceding that,\r\n\nnotwithstanding  his previous  reports to  Polaroid  stating that\r\n\nLattimore  was totally  disabled, Lattimore  was able  to perform\r\n\nlimited forms of  light duty work at the time  his STD status was\r\n\ndiscontinued.\r\n\n          However,  contrary  to   Polaroid's  contention,   that\r\n\ntestimony  does not  negate  Dr. Hillier's  previously  expressed\r\n\nopinion that, in August  of 1989, Lattimore was \"disabled.\"   Nor\r\n\ndoes it preclude a finding that Lattimore  was \"totally disabled\"\r\n\nwithin the meaning of Polaroid's STD policy.\r\n\n          It is  clear that, both  in August  of 1989 and  at the\r\n\ntime of trial, Dr.  Hillier considered Lattimore totally disabled\r\n\nfrom  performing  his  usual  job and  felt  it  inadvisable  for\r\n\nLattimore to work at all.  The fact that Dr.  Hillier also viewed\r\n\nLattimore as capable of performing some light duty tasks does not\r\n\nundercut that opinion.   Furthermore, Dr. Hillier's assessment is\r\n\nperfectly  compatible with  Polaroid's own  definition of  \"total\r\n\ndisability\" because on August 23, when Lattimore  was directed to\r\n\nreturn to work, he  was told that, after two weeks of unspecified\r\n\nlight duty, he would  be expected to work without  restriction of\r\n\nany  kind.  Thus, Lattimore was not offered work that Dr. Hillier\r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\nconsidered him able to perform.\r\n\n          Moreover, in  addition to  Dr. Hillier's  testimony and\r\n\nreports,  there was testimony from Lattimore  himself that he was\r\n\nphysically  unable to  do any  work because  of his  back injury.\r\n\nThus,  there  was sufficient  evidence  to  establish the  \"total\r\n\ndisability\"  element  of  Lattimore's  prima  facie  case.    Any\r                                                             \r\n\nconflict between that evidence  and conflicting medical  evidence\r\n\npresented by Polaroid, in rebuttal, was  a matter for the jury to\r\n\nresolve.\r\n\n                           B.  Pretext\r                                     B.  Pretext\r                                                \r\n\n          Lattimore's   effort   to   prove   pretext   consisted\r\n\nprincipally of   evidence that,  in discontinuing his  STD status\r\n\nand later terminating his  employment, Polaroid deviated from its\r\n\nestablished  policies and  practices.   Polaroid argues  that any\r\n\nsuch  irregularities were  insufficient, as  a matter of  law, to\r\n\nprove pretext.\r\n\n          Most of  the \"deviations\" cited by  Lattimore amount to\r\n\nlittle more  than quibbling  over semantics (e.g.,  whether there\r\n\nwas  a  \"disagreement\"  between  Polaroid and  Dr.  Hillier  that\r\n\njustified Polaroid's  request for  an IME).   However,  there was\r\n\nevidence from which a  jury reasonably could have found  that the\r\n\ndecision to  discontinue Lattimore's  STD status was  made before\r\n\nthe Medical Review Board  had obtained the results of  Dr. Ramos'\r\n\nIME.  As already  noted, Dr. Ramos' report  was not issued  until\r\n\napproximately one  week after the Board's  decision and Williams'\r                                       \r\n\ntestimony  that  he  learned  of  the  results  via  a  telephone\r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\nconversation with Dr. Ramos,  was contradicted by Dr. Ramos.   In\r\n\naddition,  Vincent Pina,  a  Polaroid  director, testified  that,\r\n\nunder Polaroid's STD policy, it was unimaginable that an employee\r\n\nwho had provided physicians' reports indicating  disability would\r\n\nbe  removed from  STD status  before the  Board reviewed  the IME\r\n\nresults.\r\n\n          There, also, was evidence  suggesting that the  results\r\n\nof the  IME may have been preordained.  If a jury determined that\r\n\nWilliams never talked with Dr. Ramos about his findings, it could\r\n\ninfer  that, in  alluding  to those  findings  in his  August  23\r\n\nletter, Williams must  have known,  in advance of  the IME,  what\r\n\nthose  findings were going to be.  Lattimore's testimony that the\r\n\nexamination  was  a perfunctory  one,  although  disputed by  Dr.\r\n\nRamos,  and the  evidence  that Dr.  Ramos  did not  perform  any\r\n\ndiagnostic  examinations or  review  Lattimore's medical  records\r\n\ncould provide additional support for such an inference.\r\n\n          In  short, although  the evidence  of pretext  is thin,\r\n\ndisputed  and  susceptible  to  varying  interpretations,  it  is\r\n\nsufficient  to  create  a  jury  question.    Accordingly,  since\r\n\nMassachusetts  law provides  that  an employee  may prevail  upon\r\n\nproof  of pretext,  alone,  the District  Court  did not  err  in\r\n\ndenying  Polaroid's motion for judgment  as a matter  of law with\r\n\nrespect to the Chapter 151B claim.\r\n\n                    C.  Discriminatory Intent\r                              C.  Discriminatory Intent\r                                                       \r\n\n          As already noted, Title VII requires proof of something\r\n\nmore  than pretext.   It  also  requires proof  of discriminatory\r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\nintent.     Polaroid argues  that there is  no evidence that  its\r\n\ndecisions  to  discontinue  Lattimore's STD  status  and,  later,\r\n\nterminate his employment,  were motivated  by any  discriminatory\r\n\nintent.  We agree.\r\n\n          Lattimore's claim  of  discriminatory intent  is  based\r\n\nentirely  upon  allegations that  Mitchell  was  involved in  the\r\n\ndecisions  and  upon the  fact  that  Polaroid's human  resources\r\n\nadministrator  was called to the scene when Lattimore returned to\r\n\nthe  plant  on  August 24  and  the  discussion  between him  and\r\n\nWilliams apparently became heated.\r\n\n          As already noted, Polaroid presented evidence  that the\r\n\ndecisions at  issue were made  by the Board  and by Montes.    In\r\n\nsupport  of his  assertion  that Mitchell  participated in  those\r\n\ndecisions, Lattimore  cites evidence  that, until shortly  before\r\n\nLattimore's termination, Mitchell retained custody of Lattimore's\r\n\ntime cards and received  copies of all medical  reports regarding\r\n\nLattimore's physical condition.   However, that evidence does not\r\n\ntend  to  prove  anything  other  than  that  Mitchell  may  have\r\n\ncontinued  to be  Lattimore's  \"supervisor\" during  that  period.\r\n\nThat fact,  alone, has little significance  inasmuch as Lattimore\r\n\nwas  out of  work and  not being  supervised.   By itself,  it is\r\n\ninsufficient  to support  a  reasonable  inference that  Mitchell\r\n\nparticipated,  in any way,  in the  decision to  remove Lattimore\r\n\nfrom STD status or  to fire him.  Nor  does it provide any  basis\r\n\nfor concluding  that any  alleged racial prejudice  on Mitchell's\r\n\npart infected those decisions.\r\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\n          Similarly,   the   fact   that  Florence   Ramos-Jones,\r\n\nPolaroid's   human   resources   administrator,   was   asked  to\r\n\nparticipate in  the discussion with  Lattimore on August  24 does\r\n\nnot establish  any reasonable ground for  finding that Polaroid's\r\n\ndecision was motivated by racial animus.   Lattimore argues that,\r\n\nbecause   Ms.  Ramos-Jones   dealt  with  \"racial   issues,\"  her\r\n\nparticipation   is  evidence  that  Polaroid  viewed  Lattimore's\r\n\ntermination  as  a  \"racial matter.\"      However,  there was  no\r\n\nevidence regarding  why Ms.  Ramos-Jones became involved  in that\r\n\ndiscussion.    If,  for  example,  she  became  involved  because\r\n\nLattimore,  himself,  raised the  question  of  racial bias,  her\r\n\nparticipation  would not  provide  any basis  for inferring  that\r\n\nPolaroid's decision was discriminatory.\r\n\n          In  the absence  of any  evidence  regarding Mitchell's\r\n\ninvolvement in the termination decisions or the circumstances and\r\n\nnature  of  Ms.  Ramos-Jones'  participation  in  the  August  24\r\n\ndiscussion, there  is no  justification for the  inferential leap\r\n\nurged  by  Lattimore.   Submitting  the  issue of  discriminatory\r\n\nintent to a jury on this record would amount to nothing more than\r\n\nan invitation to  speculate.  Therefore, Polaroid  is entitled to\r\n\njudgment  as  a   matter  of   law  on  the   Title  VII   status\r\n\ndiscrimination claim.\r\n\n                          IV.  New Trial\r                                    IV.  New Trial\r                                                  \r\n\n          Having  determined   that  Polaroid  was   entitled  to\r\n\njudgment as a matter of law on three  of Lattimore's four claims,\r\n\nwe  turn our attention  to whether that  determination requires a\r\n\n                               -23-\r\r\n\nnew  trial. We answer that question in the affirmative because it\r\n\nis impossible to ascertain  whether or to what extent  the jury's\r\n\nverdict was based on the three flawed claims.\r\n\n          As already  noted, the  only document completed  by the\r\n\njury was a  one page  \"jury questionnaire\" that  called upon  the\r\n\njury to  answer three questions.   Those questions  asked whether\r\n\nLattimore was harassed; whether  any such harassment  proximately\r\n\ncaused injury  to him and,  if so,  the amount of  damages to  be\r\n\nawarded.   See  Appendix A.   Because  the document  was entitled\r                        \r\n\n\"questionnaire\" rather than \"verdict\" and because it consisted of\r\n\nnothing  more than \"written  questions susceptible of categorical\r\n\nor  other brief  answer\" (Fed.  R.  Civ. P.  49(a)), we  view the\r\n\njury's response as a \"special verdict\" within the meaning of Rule\r\n\n49(a).\r\n\n          In  any  event,  under those  circumstances,  it  makes\r\n\nlittle  difference whether  the  response is  characterized as  a\r\n\ngeneral  or  special  verdict.   It  is  settled  law that,  when\r\n\nmultiple  claims are  submitted  to a  jury  and only  a  general\r\n\nverdict  is returned,  a new  trial is  required if  some of  the\r\n\nclaims   should  not   have   been  submitted   and  the   jury's\r\n\nconsideration  of those  claims  may have  affected the  verdict.\r\n\nSunkist Growers, Inc.  v.

A new\r\n\n                               -24-\r\r\n\ntrial  ordinarily  is required  when  a  special verdict  finding\r\n\nencompasses multiple  facts and claims  some of which  should not\r\n\nhave  been  submitted  to  the  jury.    In either  case,  it  is\r\n\nimpossible  to  tell  whether  consideration  of  the  improperly\r\n\nsubmitted claims may have affected the verdict.\r\n\n          In this  case, we believe  the jury's verdict  may have\r\n\nbeen affected  by its consideration of  the erroneously submitted\r\n\nclaims.    If  the  finding  that  Lattimore  was  \"harassed\"  is\r\n\nconstrued to mean that the jury found for Lattimore solely on the\r\n\nbasis of the harassment claims, the verdict was based entirely on\r\n\nthose  claims.   Alternatively,  if the  finding of  \"harassment\"\r\n\nresulted from  consideration of both  the harassment and  the job\r\n\nstatus  discrimination claims,3   there  is no  way  to determine\r\n\nwhether or  to  what extent  the harassment  claims affected  the\r\n\nverdict.  In either case, a new trial is required.\r\n\n                            Conclusion\r                                      Conclusion\r                                                \r\n\n          For all of the foregoing reasons we vacate the judgment\r\n\nentered by the  District Court,  reverse in part  and remand  the\r\n\ncase  for  a   new  trial   with  respect  to   the  job   status\r\n\ndiscrimination claim asserted pursuant to Chapter 151B.\r\n\n          Reversed in  part, vacated in  part and  remanded.   No\r                                                                           \r\n\ncosts.\r               \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3  The evidence presented related to both the harassment  and job\r\nstatus  discrimination claims and  both types of  claims were the\r\nsubject of counsels' arguments and the court's charge.\r\n\n                               -25-\r\r\n\n                                            \"Concurrence Follows\"\r\n\n                               -26-\r\r\n\n          SELYA,  Circuit Judge  (concurring).   I join  fully in\r                    SELYA,  Circuit Judge  (concurring).\r                                         \r\n\nJudge Torres' comprehensive opinion.  It is, however, unfortunate\r\n\nthat neither attorney suggested that the verdict form require the\r\n\njury to report the  results of its deliberations count  by count.\r\n\nThough,  ordinarily, little can  be gained  by crying  over spilt\r\n\nmilk, past  mistakes sometimes teach  valuable lessons.   Thus, I\r\n\nwrite separately to emphasize, for the benefit of the trial bench\r\n\nand bar in days to come, that the need  for retrial may well have\r\n\nbeen avoided in this instance by the simple expedient of taking a\r\n\nseparate  verdict on  each statement  of claim.   I  commend that\r                                                        \r\n\npractice to district judges in future multi-count cases.\r\n\n                               -27-\r\r\n</pre>",
