The Legal Framework\r                    B.  The Legal Framework\r\n\n          At  issue is 18 U.S.C.     3161 et  seq., which require\r                                                            \r\n\nthat:\r\n\n            the  trial of a  defendant charged  in an\r\n            information   or   indictment  with   the\r\n            commission of an  offense shall  commence\r\n            within seventy days  from the filing date\r\n            (and making public) of the information or\r\n            indictment,   or   from   the  date   the\r\n            defendant has appeared before  a judicial\r\n            officer of the court in which such charge\r\n            is pending, whatever date last occurs.\r\n\n18  U.S.C.   3161(c)(1); see also Henderson v. United States, 476\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. 321, 322  (1986).  If the defendant is  not brought to trial\r\n\nwithin  the   seventy  day  time  period,   \"the  information  or\r\n\nindictment  shall be dismissed on  motion of the  defendant.\"  18\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nU.S.C.   3162(a)(2); see Rodr guez,  63 F.3d at 1162.   Not every\r                                            \r\n\nday between the indictment  or appearance and the start  of trial\r\n\nis  counted,  however.    Section  3161(h)  provides  a  list  of\r\n\ncircumstances in which the STA is tolled.\r\n\n          The question  before us, therefore,  is whether seventy\r\n\ncountable  days  passed  between  the indictment  of  Sposito  on\r\n\nApril 13, 1994, and the start  of the trial on January  17, 1995.\r\n\nThere are  several periods of time  in dispute, but we  need only\r\n\nconsider the last  of these --  from December 1, 1994  to January\r\n\n13,  1995.1  Defendant states that 41 countable days passed prior\r\n\nto  December  1,  1994.   Because  we  find  that  there were  no\r\n\ncountable  days  from  December  1,  1994  to  January 13,  1995,\r\n\ndefendant's claim under the  STA must fail, regardless of  how we\r\n\nwould rule on the earlier periods.\r\n\n          On November  30, 1994,  the previously  scheduled trial\r\n\ndate  of December 12 was  postponed indefinitely.   At that time,\r\n\nthe  government's  motion  in   limine  to  restrict  the  cross-\r\n\nexamination  of  certain  law  enforcement  witnesses,  filed  on\r\n\nNovember 8, was  pending.   The motion in  limine was  eventually\r\n\nheard  during the trial, with argument on the motion taking place\r\n\non January 31, 1995.  We must decide whether the motion in limine\r\n\ntolled the STA clock from November 8 to January 13.\r\n\n          Three   principal  sources   of  authority   frame  our\r\n\ndecision.   First,  there  is the  statute,  which requires  that\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  Although  the trial started  on January 17, the  parties agree\r\nthat the filing of the January 13 motion to dismiss for violation\r\nof the STA tolled the STA clock.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n\"delay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing of the\r\n\nmotion  through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt\r\n\ndisposition of,  such motion\" be  excluded from the  time counted\r\n\nagainst  the STA.  18 U.S.C.   3161(h)(1)(F).  Congress chose not\r\n\nto  include any  explicit exceptions  in the  statutory language.\r\n\nYet Congress was conscious of the possible need for more flexible\r\n\nexclusion  requirements, as  demonstrated by  other parts  of the\r\n\nstatute.  For example, in section 3161(h)(8)(A), the Act excludes\r\n\nperiods  of delay resulting from a continuance, but only when the\r\n\ntrial  court sets forth, in  the record, its  reasons for finding\r\n\nthat \"the ends of  justice served by taking such  action outweigh\r\n\nthe  best interest of  the public and  the defendant in  a speedy\r\n\ntrial.\"  18 U.S.C.   3161(h)(8)(A).\r\n\n          Second, in  Henderson v.  United States, 476  U.S. 321,\r                                                           \r\n\n327  (1986),  the  Supreme  Court held  that  \"Congress  intended\r\n\nsubsection  (F)  to exclude  from the  Speedy Trial  Act's 70-day\r\n\nlimitation  all time  between  the filing  of  a motion  and  the\r\n\nconclusion of  the hearing on that motion, whether or not a delay\r\n\nin  holding that  hearing is  'reasonably necessary.'\"   Id.   In\r                                                                      \r\n\nHenderson,  a motion to suppress  was filed on  November 3, 1980,\r                   \r\n\nand a  hearing was  held on  March 25, 1981,  at which  the trial\r\n\ncourt  \"declined  to reach  a  final decision  because  it needed\r\n\nfurther  information.  The court  did not receive  all filings in\r\n\nconnection  with the motion until December 15, 1981.\"  Id. at 332\r                                                                    \r\n\n(citations omitted).  The  Court excluded all of this  time under\r\n\nsection 3161(h)(8)(F).  Id.\r                                     \r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n          Finally,  we  are bound  by  our own  ruling  in United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates  v. Rojo-Alvarez, 944 F.2d 959 (1st  Cir. 1991).  In Rojo-\r                                                                           \r\n\nAlvarez,  the government  filed a  motion in  limine on  March 8,\r                 \r\n\n1990.   On April 5, 1990,  the district court  reserved ruling on\r\n\nthe merits  of the  motion until  trial.   On appeal,  this court\r\n\nstated that: \r\n\n            [w]e do not believe  that a court  should\r\n            put  off consideration  of  a motion  and\r\n            exclude the time during which  the motion\r\n            lies dormant.  However, when the court is\r\n            presented with papers styled as a motion,\r\n            whether it ultimately determines that the\r\n            filing is a pretrial motion  or an 'other\r\n            proceeding'  under  (J),  the   court  is\r\n            entitled  to exclude at  least the period\r\n            of time during which  it considers how to\r\n            treat the filing.\r\n\nId. at  966.  The court  in Rojo-Alvarez disposed of  the case by\r                                                  \r\n\nexcluding the time between the filing of the  motion and the date\r\n\nupon which it was  reserved.  The panel's language  regarding the\r\n\ntime a  motion lies  dormant did  not affect  the outcome  of the\r\n\ncase.2\r\n\n          In the instant case, the government filed its motion in\r\n\nlimine on  November 8, 1994.   As  an initial matter,  motions in\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2   Cf. United States  v. Clymer, 25  F.3d 824, 829-30  (9th Cir.\r                                          \r\n1994)  (finding that  time  after the  district court  explicitly\r\npostponed ruling  on the  relevant motion  until after the  trial\r\nmust be counted against the STA clock); United States v.

Ct.  1671 (1996).  But see United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\nRiley,  991 F.2d 120,  123 (4th  Cir. 1993)  (ruling that  when a\r               \r\nhearing on a pretrial  motion is deferred until after  trial, all\r\nof the time from  the filing of the motion  until its disposition\r\nis excluded).\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nlimine  are  \"pretrial  motions\"  for  the  purposes  of  section\r\n\n3161(h)(1)(F), implying  that the filing  of such a  motion tolls\r\n\nthe STA clock.   See id.; see also United  States v. Santoyo, 890\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d  726, 728 (5th Cir. 1989); United States v. Johnson, 32 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n\n304, 306 (7th Cir. 1994).  The motion was not heard until January\r\n\n31, 1995, well  after the start of trial.   Between the filing of\r\n\nthe  motion and the trial date, the  court made no mention of the\r\n\nmotion in limine.   Specifically, it did not, at  any time, state\r\n\nthat it considered the motion \"dormant.\" \r\n\n          Defendant-appellant  contends  that the  district court\r\n\nimplicitly  relegated  the  motion  to  dormant  status  when  it\r\n\npostponed the  trial indefinitely.   He argues  that \"[u]pon  the\r\n\nissuance by the Court on November 30 of the Notice cancelling the\r\n\nDecember 12 trial date without  the setting of a new trial  date,\r\n\nand because of that Notice, it was then apparent that the Court's\r\n\nother business and  or convenience  had put the  Sposito case  on\r\n\nhold.\"  Appellant's Brief at 25.  Appellant then appeals to Rojo-\r                                                                           \r\n\nAlvarez for  the proposition that  time during which  motions lie\r                 \r\n\ndormant is to be counted against the STA clock.\r\n\n          We disagree with  appellant's claim.  In  our view, the\r\n\nmotion was  never relegated to  dormant status for  STA purposes.\r\n\nThe  order postponing  the trial  read, in  its  entirety, \"[t]he\r\n\ntrial scheduled to begin December 12, 1994 has been canceled.  It\r\n\nwill  be rescheduled for a future date  to be advised.\"  District\r\n\nCourt  Order of Cancellation, November  30, 1994.   No reason was\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\ngiven for the postponement  and there was no suggestion  that the\r\n\nmotion in limine had been reserved until trial.3\r\n\n          To  find that  the  motion was  dormant, therefore,  we\r\n\nwould have to rely on speculative inferences about the statements\r\n\nand actions  of the lower  court.  We decline  to do so.   We are\r\n\nunwilling to  adopt the position that appellate courts should sit\r\n\nin review of the day-to-day operation of district courts in order\r\n\nto  determine  when  a  district  court's  decision  to  put  off\r\n\nconsideration of a motion makes that motion \"dormant\" and when it\r\n\ndoes  not.   District courts  are busy  and must  constantly make\r\n\nscheduling decisions with  respect to the many  matters for which\r\n\nthey are responsible.  We are ill equipped to second guess  these\r\n\ndecisions.  There is  no reliable way for  an appellate court  to\r\n\ndivine  the  intent  of the  district  court  with  respect to  a\r\n\nparticular motion or its docket in general.  Rather than open the\r\n\ndoor  to appeals that ask this court to  read the tea leaves of a\r\n\ntrial's  scheduling orders,  we will  only  look to  the explicit\r\n\nstatements of the lower court.\r\n\n          Our ruling today is also based on our interpretation of\r\n\nthe STA and Henderson.  On the one hand, neither of these sources\r                               \r\n\nsuggests  that dormant  motions fail  to trigger  excludable time\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3  Appellant also points to the district court's remarks, made on\r\nthe first day of trial, in which the court referred to the motion\r\nin limine,  stating, \"I have been  planning to have  a hearing on\r\nthat  in connection with the trial  . . . .   I think holding the\r\nmotion to resolve once I  have found that there was not  going to\r\nbe  a plea,  and apparently  there won't  be, is  consistent with\r\n[Henderson].\"   However one may interpret  these remarks, they do\r                    \r\nnot amount to an  explicit relegation of the motion  in limine to\r\ndormant status.\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nunder subsection (F).  On the other hand, we recognize that there\r\n\nmay be sound policy reasons for an exception to subsection (F) in\r\n\nthe case of dormant motions.  Because the statute does not itself\r\n\ncreate  such an  exception, however,  and because  Henderson held\r                                                                      \r\n\nthat even  unreasonable delays  shall be excluded,  any exception\r\n\nfor dormant motions should  at the very least be  drawn narrowly.\r\n\nWe  do not  believe that an  exception for motions  deemed, by an\r                                                                    \r\n\nappellate  court,  to have  been  dormant,  without any  explicit\r\n\nindication  to  that  effect  by the  district  court,  would  be\r\n\nconsistent with the strong language of the STA and Henderson.\r                                                                      \r\n\n          Furthermore,  from the  point of  view of  an appellate\r\n\ncourt,  there does  not  appear to  be  a principled  distinction\r\n\nbetween a motion that is dormant and one for which  the period of\r\n\ndelay  prior to hearing is unreasonable.  In other words, finding\r\n\na motion to have been dormant without any language to that effect\r\n\nin the record will often be  similar to concluding that there has\r\n\nbeen  unreasonable delay.    Henderson has  established that  all\r                                                \r\n\ndelay,  even if unreasonable, is excluded.  To count time against\r\n\nthe  STA clock  on  the ground  that  the motion  was  implicitly\r\n\nrelegated to dormant status, therefore,  would be contrary to the\r\n\nspirit of Henderson.\r                             \r\n\n          We  hasten to add that this opinion should not be taken\r\n\neither  to criticize or  to support the  language in Rojo-Alvarez\r                                                                           \r\n\nconcerning dormant motions.

We do not comment in any\r\n\nway on the  implications, for  Speedy Trial Act  purposes, of  an\r\n\nexplicit ruling that a motion  is dormant or that the court  will\r\n\nreserve ruling on the motion.\r\n\n          As a result of our ruling,  the 43 days from December 1\r\n\nto January  13 are not counted for STA purposes.  In light of the\r\n\nfact  that appellant claims only 41 days were counted against the\r\n\nSTA clock prior  to December  1994, our finding  implies that  we\r\n\nmust affirm the district court's ruling on the STA issue.\r                     \r\n\n               II.

Padova had  testified in  October 1992,  under a\r\n\ncompulsion and immunity order, at the trial of Arthur Marder, who\r\n\nwas  accused of  illegal  gambling.   At  Marder's trial,  Padova\r\n\ntestified that Marder had told him that he was paying everyone --\r\n\nthe  implication   being  that  Marder  paid   off  local  Revere\r\n\npoliticians in order to protect his illegal video poker business.\r\n\nIt was alleged that these payments were made via Sposito.\r\n\n          At Sposito's  trial, Padova  refused  to testify,  even\r\n\nwith immunity, and was  found in contempt.  The  government moved\r\n\nto admit Padova's  testimony from  the prior Marder  trial.   The\r\n\ndistrict court found Padova to be unavailable  within the meaning\r\n\nof Federal  Rule of  Evidence 804(a)(2)  and  found the  previous\r\n\ntestimony  to  be  admissible  under  Federal  Rule  of  Evidence\r\n\n804(b)(5).

If  that fact  is\r\n\nproven,  it increases the likelihood that he was paying off those\r\n\npoliticians  through Mr. Sposito.\"   2/7 Tr. 15.   The court also\r\n\nfound  that \"the  testimony of  Padova is  more probative  on the\r\n\npoint  of  what  Arthur Marder  said  to  Padova  than any  other\r\n\ntestimony the Government can procure.\"  2/7 Tr. 16.\r\n\n          Rule 804(b)(5) requires that:\r\n\n            (A)  the statement is offered as evidence\r\n            of a material fact;\r\n\n            (B)  the statement  is more  probative on\r\n            the point  for which  it is offered  than\r\n            any  other  evidence which  the proponent\r\n            can  procure through  reasonable efforts;\r\n            and\r\n\n            (C) the general  purposes of these  rules\r\n            and the interests of justice will best be\r\n            served by admission of the statement into\r\n            evidence.\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nFed. R. Evid.  804(b)(5)(A), (B),  (C).4  Reading  the first  two\r\n\nsubparagraphs together,  defendant argues,  requires that  (B) be\r\n\nread  as if it  included the words  \"of material  fact\" after the\r\n\nword  \"point.\"   Thus, the  defendant alleges  that  the district\r\n\ncourt  erred by  not directing  its inquiry  to the  \"question of\r\n\nwhether Marder's  statement to Padova  was more probative  on the\r\n\nissue of whether Marder was paying off politicians than any other\r\n\navailable testimony.\"  Appellant's Brief at 35.\r\n\n          Before  proceeding, we  note that  defendant's argument\r\n\nrests on the  assumption that the question of what Marder said to\r\n\nPadova is  not  a material  fact.   If  it  is a  material  fact,\r\n\nPadova's testimony  would be admissible,  even under  defendant's\r\n\npreferred interpretation of  the rule.  To conclude, as defendant\r\n\ndoes, that the question of whether Marder  was paying politicians\r\n\nis   material fact  and yet  the fact that  he stated  as much to\r\n\nPadova is not a material fact is an exceedingly fine distinction,\r\n\nand not one upon which the question of admissibility should turn.\r\n\n          The  relationship between subparagraphs  (A) and (B) of\r\n\nRule  804(b)(5) appears to be a matter of first impression within\r\n\nthe circuit.   We begin, as  always, with an  examination of  the\r\n\nplain  language of the rule.   Subsection (B)  requires only that\r\n\nthe statement be  more probative on  \"the point  for which it  is\r\n\noffered.\"    The  subparagraph  does not  include  the  words \"of\r\n\nmaterial fact\" as advocated  by defendant.  The drafters  of Rule\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n4  In  addition to  these requirements, the  statement must  also\r\nhave \"equivalent  guarantees of trustworthiness.\"   Fed. R. Evid.\r\n804(b)(5).\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\n804(b)(5) separated the \"material fact\" element of the test found\r\n\nin  subparagraph  (A)  from   the  \"more  probative\"  element  of\r\n\nsubparagraph (B).   Were the  rule intended to  have the  meaning\r\n\nadvocated  by defendant,  it could  have been  written  with much\r\n\ngreater  clarity.  Had the  drafters wanted to  include the words\r\n\n\"of material fact\" following the word \"point\" in subparagraph (B)\r\n\nthey obviously could  have done  so.  Furthermore,  by doing  so,\r\n\nthey  would have eliminated the need for subparagraph (A) because\r\n\nthe necessity of a material fact would be explicit in the revised\r\n\nsubparagraph (B).  As written, however, the plain language of the\r\n\nrule does not  require that the issue  on which the statement  is\r\n\nmost probative be a  material fact; it  requires only that it  be\r\n\nprobative on the point \"for which it is offered.\"   Fed. R. Evid.\r\n\n804(b)(5)(B).\r\n\n          Furthermore,  subparagraph (A)  requires only  that the\r\n\nstatement be offered as evidence of a material fact.  It need not\r                                          \r\n\nitself be  a material fact.   If we were to  import language from\r\n\nsubparagraph (A) to subparagraph (B), it would be more natural to\r\n\nadd the words \"of evidence\" after the word \"point,\" such that (B)\r\n\nread, \"the statement is  more probative on the point  of evidence\r                                                                           \r\n\nfor which  it is  offered than any  other evidence.\"   Under this\r\n\ninterpretation, appellant's claim would fail.  The district court\r\n\nestablished  that the statement  was offered  as evidence  of the\r\n\nfact that Marder was  paying off politicians and that  the latter\r\n\nwas a point of material fact.  The statement is more probative on\r\n\nthat point  of evidence --  what Marder told  Padova -- than  any\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nother  evidence   that  the  government  could   procure  through\r\n\nreasonable efforts.\r\n\n          Defendant, perhaps recognizing that the language of the\r\n\nrule  is  not favorable  to  his argument,  turns  to legislative\r\n\nhistory.   He  points to  language in  the Senate  Report to  the\r\n\neffect that the residual hearsay exception should be used rarely.\r\n\nS.  Rep. No.  1277,  93d  Cong.,  2nd  Sess.  (1974).    Our  own\r\n\nexamination of the legislative history, however, reveals that the\r\n\ninclusion  of the  residual  hearsay exception  was intended  for\r\n\ncases,  such as  the  one before  us,  that \"have  guarantees  of\r\n\ntrustworthiness   equivalent  to  or   exceeding  the  guarantees\r\n\nreflected  by the [other Rule  804(b)] exceptions, and  to have a\r\n\nhigh degree of prolativeness [sic].\"  Id.\r                                                   \r\n\n          In  order to illustrate  the type of  evidence that the\r\n\nSenate  Committee felt should be  admitted but that  may not fall\r\n\nwithin one of  the other  hearsay exceptions,  the Senate  Report\r\n\ncited Dallas  County v.  Commercial Union Assurance  Company, 286\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 388 (5th Cir. 1961).   S. Rep. No.  1277.  At issue in  that\r\n\ncase was the cause of the collapse of the Dallas County Courtroom\r\n\nclock tower.  Insurance  investigators believed that it collapsed\r\n\ndue to structural defects.  Dallas County believed that the tower\r\n\ncollapsed as a result of being struck by a bolt of lightning.  In\r\n\nsupport  of its  position, the  County introduced  into evidence,\r\n\namong  other things,  charcoal and  charred timbers found  in the\r\n\ntower debris.  Id. at 390.  In order to  rebut this evidence, the\r                            \r\n\ninsurers  sought  to  introduce  a newspaper  article  from  1901\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\ndescribing  a fire  that had  occurred in  the courtroom  in that\r\n\nyear.   The court admitted the evidence  despite the fact that it\r\n\nwas not characterized \"as a 'business record', nor as an 'ancient\r\n\ndocument',  nor as  any  other readily  identifiable and  happily\r\n\ntagged species of hearsay exception.\"  Id. at 398.\r                                                    \r\n\n          The  Senate Report  stated that  \"[b]ecause exceptional\r\n\ncases like  the Dallas County case  may arise in  the future, the\r                                       \r\n\ncommittee has decided to reinstate a residual exception for rules\r\n\n803 and 804(b).\"  S. Rep. No. 1277.\r\n\n          Under  defendant's construction of the residual hearsay\r\n\nexception, however, the newspaper  article in Dallas County would\r                                                                     \r\n\nnot  be admissible.    The newspaper  article  was introduced  as\r\n\nevidence of the material  fact that the charred timbers  were the\r\n\nresult of a fire that  took place more than fifty years  prior to\r\n\nthe case.  The  newspaper story did not, however,  go directly to\r\n\nthe question  of why the  charred timbers  were in the  tower, it\r\n\nonly  went to the fact that  there had been a fire  in 1901.  The\r\n\nstory was not more probative on the point of why the timbers were\r\n\ncharred than any other evidence.  It was, however, more probative\r\n\nthan  any other evidence that  the insurers could  provide on the\r\n\nquestion of whether there had been a fire.\r\n\n          Just as in  the case at  bar, therefore, a  requirement\r\n\nthat the statement  be more  probative on the  point of  material\r\n\nfact than  other available evidence would exclude the evidence in\r\n\nquestion.  This is certainly not what the Senate Committee, which\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\nused the Dallas County  case as an  example of evidence that  was\r                                \r\n\ncorrectly admitted, intended.\r\n\n          Finally, we turn to the policies served by the residual\r\n\nhearsay exception.  These can be summarized as follows:\r\n\n            1.  To provide sufficient  flexibility to\r\n            permit the  courts to  deal with  new and\r\n            unanticipated situations.\r\n\n            2.    To  preserve the  integrity  of the\r\n            specifically enumerated exceptions.\r\n\n            3.   To facilitate the  basic purpose  of\r\n            the  Federal  Rules  of  Evidence:  truth\r\n            ascertainment  and  fair adjudication  of\r\n            controversies.\r\n\n11 Moore's Federal  Practice    803(24)[7] (2d ed.  1994 &amp;  Supp.\r\n\n1996-97).  It  is our view that these  objectives are best served\r\n\nby rejecting defendant's proposed construction of 804(b)(5).  The\r\n\ndefendant's  proposed interpretation would  needlessly reduce the\r\n\nflexibility   available   to   courts  dealing   with   new   and\r\n\nunanticipated  situations.   By excluding  evidence that  has, as\r\n\nrequired  by 804(b)(5), \"equivalent  circumstantial guarantees of\r\n\ntrustworthiness,\" defendant's proposed interpretation  would also\r\n\nmake  truth ascertainment  and the  fair adjudication  of justice\r\n\nunnecessarily difficult.\r\n\n          For  the  above  reasons,   we  decline  to  adopt  the\r\n\ndefendant's reading of subparagraphs (A) and (B), and we conclude\r\n\nthat the district court did not  err, as a matter of law, in  its\r\n\ninterpretation of Rule 804(b)(5)(B).\r\n\n          We examine  the  district court's  application  of  the\r\n\nrule.  Defendant-appellant claims  that the admission of Padova's\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\ntestimony  was erroneous  because  the district  court failed  to\r\n\nanalyze each part  of the  testimony in order  to determine  each\r\n\npart's reliability.   In support  of his  claim, defendant  cites\r\n\nWilliamson  v. United  States,  512 U.S.  594,  114 S.  Ct.  2431\r                                       \r\n\n(1994), in which the  Supreme Court ruled that, for  the purposes\r\n\nof Rule 804(b)(3), which governs statements against interest, the\r\n\nword  \"statement\" refers to a single remark.  \"The district court\r\n\nmay  not  just  assume for  purposes  of  Rule  804(b)(3) that  a\r\n\nstatement  is self-inculpatory  because it  is part  of a  fuller\r\n\nconfession.\"   Williamson, 512  U.S. at   ,  114 S.

If Williamson's definition of \"statement\" does\r                                          \r\n\nnot  apply, defendant's claim is without merit because we find no\r\n\nplain error in the district court's  review of the testimony as a\r\n\nwhole   --  viewing  it  as   a  single  statement   --  and  its\r\n\ndetermination  that  the  requirements  of  Rule  804(b)(5)  were\r\n\nsatisfied.    The district  court  concluded  that the  testimony\r\n\nincluded adequate  guarantees of  trustworthiness because  it was\r\n\ngiven  under  oath,  because  Padova was  immunized,  because  he\r\n\ntestified upon personal knowledge,  and because he was vigorously\r\n\ncross-examined by  defense counsel in  the Marder trial.6   These\r\n\nindicia  of  reliability are  sufficient  to  establish that  the\r\n\ndistrict court's  conclusion that the testimony  was reliable was\r\n\nnot plain error.  The district court also found subparagraphs (A)\r\n\nthrough  (C) satisfied,  and  we  find  no  plain  error  in  its\r\n\nanalysis.7\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n5   But see United  States v.

Ct. 716 (1996).\r                \r\n\n6  Defendant accurately points out that testifying under immunity\r\nis  not always  considered an  indicator  of truthfulness.   See,\r                                                                          \r\ne.g., United States v. Zanino, 895 F.2d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1990).  It\r                                       \r\nis  not for  us,  however, to  conduct  a plenary  review of  the\r\ndistrict court's  determination regarding the reliability  of the\r\ntestimony or to  review every factor  considered by the  district\r\ncourt.  The fact that the trial judge felt immunity bolstered the\r\ncredibility of the testimony does not amount to plain error.\r\n\n7   Appellant  alleges that  the district  court examined  only a\r\nsmall  part of  Padova's  testimony and  improperly admitted  the\r\nremainder of the testimony.  We find no support for this claim in\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\n          If   Williamson  applies,  our  analysis  becomes  more\r                                   \r\n\ncomplicated.   The district court does not appear to have engaged\r\n\nin a sentence-by-sentence analysis of the testimony, as  would be\r\n\nrequired  by Williamson.  The  indicators of reliability that the\r                                 \r\n\ndistrict  court used, however, are not specific to any portion of\r\n\nthe  testimony  and  would  apply  to  every  statement  therein,\r\n\nimplying that there is  no error with respect to  the reliability\r\n\nof the testimony.   Specifically, the district court  stated that\r\n\n\"Mr. Padova  testified at  the Marder  trial under  oath, he  was\r\n\nimmunized and, therefore, had  an incentive to tell the  truth in\r\n\norder  to avoid prosecution for perjury.  He testified based upon\r\n\npersonal  knowledge.\"    The  judge  also  noted  that   \"he  was\r\n\nvigorously  cross-examined by  Mr. Duggan, the  defense counsel.\"\r\n\nTr. 2/7 14-15.\r\n\n          Had  the trial  court conducted  a sentence-by-sentence\r\n\nanalysis, therefore, it would have applied these same criteria to\r\n\nevery sentence  and  would  have  concluded  that  each  one  had\r\n\nsufficient indicators  of reliability.  There  was, therefore, no\r\n\nplain  error  in  the  assessment  of  the  reliability  of   the\r\n\ntestimony.\r\n\n          With   respect  to   subparagraphs   (A)-(C)  of   Rule\r\n\n804(b)(5),  however,  not  every  sentence of  the  testimony  is\r\n\nadmissible.   For example,  not every sentence  in that testimony\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nthe record.  The transcripts of the proceedings indicate that the\r\ndistrict  court considered the testimony  as a whole  in order to\r\ndetermine whether  the requirements  of Rule 804(b)(5)  were met.\r\nTr. 2/7 13-16.\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\ncan be said to have been offered as evidence of  a material fact.\r\n\nFor this reason, assuming, arguendo, that Williamson applies, the\r                                                              \r\n\ndistrict court's  ruling  was  erroneous.   The  error  was  not,\r\n\nhowever,  \"plain,\" as  required  by  Winter.    In  order  to  be\r                                                     \r\n\nconsidered  plain, the error must  be \"so 'plain'  that the trial\r\n\njudge  and prosecutor  were  derelict in  countenancing it,  even\r\n\nabsent  the  defendant's  timely  assistance  in  detecting  it.\"\r\n\nUnited States v. Frady, 456  U.S. 152, 163 (1982).  The  error in\r                                \r\n\nthis case was not sufficiently clear as to rise to the level of a\r\n\nplain  error.   The error,  if it  existed at  all, turns  on the\r\n\ninterpretation and  application of  Williamson to a  case dealing\r                                                        \r\n\nwith  a hearsay exception that was  not implicated in Williamson.\r                                                                          \r\n\nNo  cases are  on point in  this circuit,  and the  issue was not\r\n\nraised at trial.\r\n\n          Furthermore, even if we  concluded that there was plain\r\n\nerror,  the  defendant still  must show  that the  error affected\r\n\n\"substantial rights.\"  In order to affect substantial rights, the\r\n\nerror  \"must have  affected  the outcome  of  the district  court\r\n\nproceedings.\"  Olano, 507 U.S. at 734.  The analysis  is the same\r                              \r\n\nas  a  \"harmless  error\"  analysis,  except  that  \"[i]t  is  the\r\n\ndefendant  rather than  the  Government who  bears the  burden of\r\n\npersuasion with respect  to prejudice.\"   Id.   Defendant in  the\r                                                       \r\n\ninstant  case has failed  to demonstrate that  the error affected\r\n\nthe outcome of  the proceedings.   Indeed,  defendant-appellant's\r\n\nbrief pursues only  a harmful error  argument and concludes  that\r\n\n\"Padova's testimony  .  . .  very  well  could  have  tipped  the\r                                                              \r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\nscales.\"  Appellant's  Brief at 44 (emphasis added).   Even if we\r\n\nwere to agree with  this assertion, it is  not enough, under  the\r\n\nplain  error standard,  that  the error  could  have changed  the\r                                                              \r\n\noutcome.  We  can find plain  error only if  the error must  have\r                                                                           \r\n\ndone so.\r\n\n          Finally,  we address  defendant's claim  that Sposito's\r\n\ncounsel  would  have undertaken  a  more  vigorous and  extensive\r\n\ncross-examination of Padova than did Marder's counsel.  We do not\r\n\ndispute that it would have been better to have Padova testify and\r\n\nbe  subject  to  cross-examination.    Given  that  he  was   not\r\n\navailable, a  fact defendant  does not  dispute, the  question is\r\n\nwhether  his previous testimony should have  been admitted.  This\r\n\nmatter  goes to  the question  of whether  there  were sufficient\r\n\nguarantees  of trustworthiness.   As  we have  already discussed,\r\n\ndefendant  has failed  to persuade  this court that  the district\r\n\ncourt's conclusion that such guarantees existed was plain error.\r\n\n                         III.  Conclusion\r                                   III.  Conclusion\r\n\n          For  the  foregoing  reasons,  we  affirm the  district\r                                                       affirm\r                                                             \r\n\ncourt's rulings on the STA claim and the evidence claim.\r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n",

The Legal Framework</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At issue is 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3161 et seq., which require that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>the trial of a defendant charged in an information or indictment with the commission of an offense shall commence within seventy days from the filing date (and making public) of the information or indictment, or from the date the defendant has appeared before a judicial officer of the court in which such charge is pending, whatever date last occurs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(c)(1);  see also Henderson v. United States, 476 U.S. 321, 322, 106 S.Ct. 1871, 1872-73, 90 L.Ed.2d 299 (1986).  If the defendant is not brought to trial within the seventy day time period, \"the information or indictment shall be dismissed on motion of the defendant.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3162(a)(2);  see Rodriguez, 63 F.3d at 1162.   Not every day between the indictment or appearance and the start of trial is counted, however.  Section 3161(h) provides a list of circumstances in which the STA is tolled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question before us, therefore, is whether seventy countable days passed between the indictment of Sposito on April 13, 1994, and the start of the trial on January 17, 1995.  There are several periods of time in dispute, but we need only consider the last of these--from December 1, 1994 to January 13, 1995.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Defendant states that 41 countable days passed prior to December 1, 1994.  Because we find that there were no countable days from December 1, 1994 to January 13, 1995, defendant's claim under the STA must fail, regardless of how we would rule on the earlier periods.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 30, 1994, the previously scheduled trial date of December 12 was postponed indefinitely.  At that time, the government's motion in limine to restrict the cross-examination of certain law enforcement witnesses, filed on November 8, was pending.  The motion in limine was eventually heard during the trial, with argument on the motion taking place on January 31, 1995.  We must decide whether the motion in limine tolled the STA clock from November 8 to January 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three principal sources of authority frame our decision.  First, there is the statute, which requires that \"delay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of, such motion\" be excluded from the time counted against the STA.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(1)(F).  Congress chose not to include any explicit exceptions in the statutory language.  Yet Congress was conscious of the possible need for more flexible exclusion requirements, as demonstrated by other parts of the statute.  For example, in section 3161(h)(8)(A), the Act excludes periods of delay resulting from a continuance, but only when the trial court sets forth, in the record, its reasons for finding that \"the ends of justice served by taking such action outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(8)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, in Henderson v. United States, 476 U.S. 321, 327, 106 S.Ct. 1871, 1875, 90 L.Ed.2d 299 (1986), the Supreme Court held that \"Congress intended subsection (F) to exclude from the Speedy Trial Act's 70-day limitation all time between the filing of a motion and the conclusion of the hearing on that motion, whether or not a delay in holding that hearing is 'reasonably necessary.' \"  Id.  In Henderson, a motion to suppress was filed on November 3, 1980, and a hearing was held on March 25, 1981, at which the trial court \"declined to reach a final decision because it needed further information.  The court did not receive all filings in connection with the motion until December 15, 1981.\"  Id. at 332, 106 S.Ct. at 1877-78 (citations omitted).  The Court excluded all of this time under section 3161(h)(8)(F).  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we are bound by our own ruling in United States v. Rojo-Alvarez, 944 F.2d 959 (1st Cir.1991).  In Rojo-Alvarez, the government filed a motion in limine on March 8, 1990.  On April 5, 1990, the district court reserved ruling on the merits of the motion until trial.  On appeal, this court stated that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>[w]e do not believe that a court should put off consideration of a motion and exclude the time during which the motion lies dormant.  However, when the court is presented with papers styled as a motion, whether it ultimately determines that the filing is a pretrial motion or an 'other proceeding' under (J), the court is entitled to exclude at least the period of time during which it considers how to treat the filing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 966.   The court in Rojo-Alvarez disposed of the case by excluding the time between the filing of the motion and the date upon which it was reserved.  The panel's language regarding the time a motion lies dormant did not affect the outcome of the case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, the government filed its motion in limine on November 8, 1994.  As an initial matter, motions in limine are \"pretrial motions\" for the purposes of section 3161(h)(1)(F), implying that the filing of such a motion tolls the STA clock.  See id.;   see also United States v. Santoyo, 890 F.2d 726, 728 (5th Cir.1989);  United States v. Johnson, 32 F.3d 304, 306 (7th Cir.1994).  The motion was not heard until January 31, 1995, well after the start of trial.  Between the filing of the motion and the trial date, the court made no mention of the motion in limine.  Specifically, it did not, at any time, state that it considered the motion \"dormant.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant-appellant contends that the district court implicitly relegated the motion to dormant status when it postponed the trial indefinitely.  He argues that \"[u]pon the issuance by the Court on November 30 of the Notice cancelling the December 12 trial date without the setting of a new trial date, and because of that Notice, it was then apparent that the Court's other business and or convenience had put the Sposito case on hold.\"   Appellant's Brief at 25.  Appellant then appeals to Rojo-Alvarez for the proposition that time during which motions lie dormant is to be counted against the STA clock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree with appellant's claim.  In our view, the motion was never relegated to dormant status for STA purposes.  The order postponing the trial read, in its entirety, \"[t]he trial scheduled to begin December 12, 1994 has been canceled.  It will be rescheduled for a future date to be advised.\"   District Court Order of Cancellation, November 30, 1994.  No reason was given for the postponement and there was no suggestion that the motion in limine had been reserved until trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To find that the motion was dormant, therefore, we would have to rely on speculative inferences about the statements and actions of the lower court.  We decline to do so.  We are unwilling to adopt the position that appellate courts should sit in review of the day-to-day operation of district courts in order to determine when a district court's decision to put off consideration of a motion makes that motion \"dormant\" and when it does not.  District courts are busy and must constantly make scheduling decisions with respect to the many matters for which they are responsible.  We are ill equipped to second guess these decisions.  There is no reliable way for an appellate court to divine the intent of the district court with respect to a particular motion or its docket in general.  Rather than open the door to appeals that ask this court to read the tea leaves of a trial's scheduling orders, we will only look to the explicit statements of the lower court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our ruling today is also based on our interpretation of the STA and Henderson.   On the one hand, neither of these sources suggests that dormant motions fail to trigger excludable time under subsection (F).  On the other hand, we recognize that there may be sound policy reasons for an exception to subsection (F) in the case of dormant motions.  Because the statute does not itself create such an exception, however, and because Henderson held that even unreasonable delays shall be excluded, any exception for dormant motions should at the very least be drawn narrowly.  We do not believe that an exception for motions deemed, by an appellate court, to have been dormant, without any explicit indication to that effect by the district court, would be consistent with the strong language of the STA and Henderson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, from the point of view of an appellate court, there does not appear to be a principled distinction between a motion that is dormant and one for which the period of delay prior to hearing is unreasonable.  In other words, finding a motion to have been dormant without any language to that effect in the record will often be similar to concluding that there has been unreasonable delay.  Henderson has established that all delay, even if unreasonable, is excluded.  To count time against the STA clock on the ground that the motion was implicitly relegated to dormant status, therefore, would be contrary to the spirit of Henderson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hasten to add that this opinion should not be taken either to criticize or to support the language in Rojo-Alvarez concerning dormant motions.  See Rojo-Alvarez, 944 F.2d at 966.   Our holding only extends to the question of whether or not the district court reserved ruling on the motion or otherwise relegated the motion to dormant status.  We do not comment in any way on the implications, for Speedy Trial Act purposes, of an explicit ruling that a motion is dormant or that the court will reserve ruling on the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of our ruling, the 43 days from December 1 to January 13 are not counted for STA purposes.  In light of the fact that appellant claims only 41 days were counted against the STA clock prior to December 1994, our finding implies that we must affirm the district court's ruling on the STA issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. The Admission of Evidence Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant-appellant next alleges that the district court erred in admitting into evidence the prior testimony of Louis Padova.  Padova had testified in October 1992, under a compulsion and immunity order, at the trial of Arthur Marder, who was accused of illegal gambling.  At Marder's trial, Padova testified that Marder had told him that he was paying everyone--the implication being that Marder paid off local Revere politicians in order to protect his illegal video poker business.  It was alleged that these payments were made via Sposito.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At Sposito's trial, Padova refused to testify, even with immunity, and was found in contempt.  The government moved to admit Padova's testimony from the prior Marder trial.  The district court found Padova to be unavailable within the meaning of Federal Rule of Evidence 804(a)(2) and found the previous testimony to be admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(5).  Appellant contests the Rule 804(b)(5) ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The proper interpretation of the Federal Rules of Evidence is a question of law and is reviewed de novo, see Texaco Puerto Rico v. Department of Consumer Affairs, 60 F.3d 867, 874-75 (1st Cir.1995);  Hathaway v. Coughlin, 99 F.3d 550, 555 (2d Cir.1996);  United States v. Medina-Estrada, 81 F.3d 981, 986 (10th Cir.1996), but the application of Rule 804(b)(5) is reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.  See Cook v. United States, 904 F.2d 107, 111 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In ruling on the question, the district court found \"that the testimony relates to a material fact whether Arthur Marder was indeed paying off politicians to obtain protection for his video poker machine business in Revere.  If that fact is proven, it increases the likelihood that he was paying off those politicians through Mr. Sposito.\"   2/7 Tr. 15.  The court also found that \"the testimony of Padova is more probative on the point of what Arthur Marder said to Padova than any other testimony the Government can procure.\"   2/7 Tr. 16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Rule 804(b)(5) requires that:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>(A) the statement is offered as evidence of a material fact;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>(B) the statement is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence which the proponent can procure through reasonable efforts;  and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>(C) the general purposes of these rules and the interests of justice will best be served by admission of the statement into evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(5)(A), (B), (C).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Reading the first two subparagraphs together, defendant argues, requires that (B) be read as if it included the words \"of material fact\" after the word \"point.\"   Thus, the defendant alleges that the district court erred by not directing its inquiry to the \"question of whether Marder's statement to Padova was more probative on the issue of whether Marder was paying off politicians than any other available testimony.\"   Appellant's Brief at 35.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before proceeding, we note that defendant's argument rests on the assumption that the question of what Marder said to Padova is not a material fact.  If it is a material fact, Padova's testimony would be admissible, even under defendant's preferred interpretation of the rule.  To conclude, as defendant does, that the question of whether Marder was paying politicians is material fact and yet the fact that he stated as much to Padova is not a material fact is an exceedingly fine distinction, and not one upon which the question of admissibility should turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relationship between subparagraphs (A) and (B) of Rule 804(b)(5) appears to be a matter of first impression within the circuit.  We begin, as always, with an examination of the plain language of the rule.  Subsection (B) requires only that the statement be more probative on \"the point for which it is offered.\"   The subparagraph does not include the words \"of material fact\" as advocated by defendant.  The drafters of Rule 804(b)(5) separated the \"material fact\" element of the test found in subparagraph (A) from the \"more probative\" element of subparagraph (B).  Were the rule intended to have the meaning advocated by defendant, it could have been written with much greater clarity.  Had the drafters wanted to include the words \"of material fact\" following the word \"point\" in subparagraph (B) they obviously could have done so.  Furthermore, by doing so, they would have eliminated the need for subparagraph (A) because the necessity of a material fact would be explicit in the revised subparagraph (B).  As written, however, the plain language of the rule does not require that the issue on which the statement is most probative be a material fact;  it requires only that it be probative on the point \"for which it is offered.\"  Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(5)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, subparagraph (A) requires only that the statement be offered as evidence of a material fact.  It need not itself be a material fact.  If we were to import language from subparagraph (A) to subparagraph (B), it would be more natural to add the words \"of evidence\" after the word \"point,\" such that (B) read, \"the statement is more probative on the point of evidence for which it is offered than any other evidence.\"   Under this interpretation, appellant's claim would fail.  The district court established that the statement was offered as evidence of the fact that Marder was paying off politicians and that the latter was a point of material fact.  The statement is more probative on that point of evidence--what Marder told Padova--than any other evidence that the government could procure through reasonable efforts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant, perhaps recognizing that the language of the rule is not favorable to his argument, turns to legislative history.  He points to language in the Senate Report to the effect that the residual hearsay exception should be used rarely.  S.Rep. No. 1277, 93d Cong., 2nd Sess.  (1974), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1974, p.7051.  Our own examination of the legislative history, however, reveals that the inclusion of the residual hearsay exception was intended for cases, such as the one before us, that \"have guarantees of trustworthiness equivalent to or exceeding the guarantees reflected by the [other Rule 804(b) ] exceptions, and to have a high degree of prolativeness [sic].\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to illustrate the type of evidence that the Senate Committee felt should be admitted but that may not fall within one of the other hearsay exceptions, the Senate Report cited Dallas County v. Commercial Union Assurance Company, 286 F.2d 388 (5th Cir.1961).  S.Rep. No. 1277.  At issue in that case was the cause of the collapse of the Dallas County Courtroom clock tower.  Insurance investigators believed that it collapsed due to structural defects.  Dallas County believed that the tower collapsed as a result of being struck by a bolt of lightning.  In support of its position, the County introduced into evidence, among other things, charcoal and charred timbers found in the tower debris.  Id. at 390.   In order to rebut this evidence, the insurers sought to introduce a newspaper article from 1901 describing a fire that had occurred in the courtroom in that year.  The court admitted the evidence despite the fact that it was not characterized \"as a 'business record', nor as an 'ancient document', nor as any other readily identifiable and happily tagged species of hearsay exception.\"  Id. at 398.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Senate Report stated that \"[b]ecause exceptional cases like the Dallas County case may arise in the future, the committee has decided to reinstate a residual exception for rules 803 and 804(b).\"   S.Rep. No. 1277, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1974, p.7066.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under defendant's construction of the residual hearsay exception, however, the newspaper article in Dallas County would not be admissible.  The newspaper article was introduced as evidence of the material fact that the charred timbers were the result of a fire that took place more than fifty years prior to the case.  The newspaper story did not, however, go directly to the question of why the charred timbers were in the tower, it only went to the fact that there had been a fire in 1901.  The story was not more probative on the point of why the timbers were charred than any other evidence.  It was, however, more probative than any other evidence that the insurers could provide on the question of whether there had been a fire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just as in the case at bar, therefore, a requirement that the statement be more probative on the point of material fact than other available evidence would exclude the evidence in question.  This is certainly not what the Senate Committee, which used the Dallas County case as an example of evidence that was correctly admitted, intended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we turn to the policies served by the residual hearsay exception.  These can be summarized as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>1.  To provide sufficient flexibility to permit the courts to deal with new and unanticipated situations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>2. To preserve the integrity of the specifically enumerated exceptions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>3. To facilitate the basic purpose of the Federal Rules of Evidence:  truth ascertainment and fair adjudication of controversies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">11 Moore's Federal Practice &#167; 803(24) (2d ed. 1994 &amp; Supp.1996-97).  It is our view that these objectives are best served by rejecting defendant's proposed construction of 804(b)(5).  The defendant's proposed interpretation would needlessly reduce the flexibility available to courts dealing with new and unanticipated situations.  By excluding evidence that has, as required by 804(b)(5), \"equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness,\" defendant's proposed interpretation would also make truth ascertainment and the fair adjudication of justice unnecessarily difficult.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the above reasons, we decline to adopt the defendant's reading of subparagraphs (A) and (B), and we conclude that the district court did not err, as a matter of law, in its interpretation of Rule 804(b)(5)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We examine the district court's application of the rule.  Defendant-appellant claims that the admission of Padova's testimony was erroneous because the district court failed to analyze each part of the testimony in order to determine each part's reliability.  In support of his claim, defendant cites Williamson v. United States, 512 U.S. 594, 114 S.Ct. 2431, 129 L.Ed.2d 476 (1994), in which the Supreme Court ruled that, for the purposes of Rule 804(b)(3), which governs statements against interest, the word \"statement\" refers to a single remark.  \"The district court may not just assume for purposes of Rule 804(b)(3) that a statement is self-inculpatory because it is part of a fuller confession.\"  Williamson, 512 U.S. at 601, 114 S.Ct. at 2435.   Defendant would have us apply the same definition of \"statement\" to Rule 804(b)(5) and, under such a definition, he argues that the district court failed to analyze each part of the testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note initially that defendant failed to raise this issue at trial.  Arguments raised for the first time on appeal are forfeited and reversible only upon a demonstration of \"plain error.\"  United States v. Sullivan, 98 F.3d 686, 687 (1st Cir.1996).  \"Under this standard, an appellant bears the burden of establishing:  (1) 'error,' i.e., a '[d]eviation from a legal rule';  (2) that the error is 'plain' or 'obvious';  and (3) that the plain error affected 'substantial rights.' \"  United States v. Winter, 70 F.3d 655 (1st Cir.1995) (quoting United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776-77, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1366, 134 L.Ed.2d 532 (1996);  Fed.R.Crim.Proc. 52(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This circuit has not yet determined whether the definition of \"statement\" adopted for Rule 804(b)(3) in Williamson also applies to Rule 804(b)(5).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  We need not make this determination in the instant case, because defendant's claim fails regardless.  If Williamson 's definition of \"statement\" does not apply, defendant's claim is without merit because we find no plain error in the district court's review of the testimony as a whole--viewing it as a single statement--and its determination that the requirements of Rule 804(b)(5) were satisfied.  The district court concluded that the testimony included adequate guarantees of trustworthiness because it was given under oath, because Padova was immunized, because he testified upon personal knowledge, and because he was vigorously cross-examined by defense counsel in the Marder trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  These indicia of reliability are sufficient to establish that the district court's conclusion that the testimony was reliable was not plain error.  The district court also found subparagraphs (A) through (C) satisfied, and we find no plain error in its analysis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If Williamson applies, our analysis becomes more complicated.  The district court does not appear to have engaged in a sentence-by-sentence analysis of the testimony, as would be required by Williamson.   The indicators of reliability that the district court used, however, are not specific to any portion of the testimony and would apply to every statement therein, implying that there is no error with respect to the reliability of the testimony.  Specifically, the district court stated that \"Mr. Padova testified at the Marder trial under oath, he was immunized and, therefore, had an incentive to tell the truth in order to avoid prosecution for perjury.  He testified based upon personal knowledge.\"   The judge also noted that \"he was vigorously cross-examined by Mr. Duggan, the defense counsel.\"   Tr. 2/7 14-15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had the trial court conducted a sentence-by-sentence analysis, therefore, it would have applied these same criteria to every sentence and would have concluded that each one had sufficient indicators of reliability.  There was, therefore, no plain error in the assessment of the reliability of the testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to subparagraphs (A)-(C) of Rule 804(b)(5), however, not every sentence of the testimony is admissible.  For example, not every sentence in that testimony can be said to have been offered as evidence of a material fact.  For this reason, assuming, arguendo, that Williamson applies, the district court's ruling was erroneous.  The error was not, however, \"plain,\" as required by Winter.   In order to be considered plain, the error must be \"so 'plain' that the trial judge and prosecutor were derelict in countenancing it, even absent the defendant's timely assistance in detecting it.\"  United States v. Frady, 456 U.S. 152, 163, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 1592, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982).  The error in this case was not sufficiently clear as to rise to the level of a plain error.  The error, if it existed at all, turns on the interpretation and application of Williamson to a case dealing with a hearsay exception that was not implicated in Williamson.   No cases are on point in this circuit, and the issue was not raised at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, even if we concluded that there was plain error, the defendant still must show that the error affected \"substantial rights.\"   In order to affect substantial rights, the error \"must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\"  Olano, 507 U.S. at 734, 113 S.Ct. at 1778.   The analysis is the same as a \"harmless error\" analysis, except that \"[i]t is the defendant rather than the Government who bears the burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice.\"  Id.  Defendant in the instant case has failed to demonstrate that the error affected the outcome of the proceedings.  Indeed, defendant-appellant's brief pursues only a harmful error argument and concludes that \"Padova's testimony ... very well could have tipped the scales.\"   Appellant's Brief at 44 (emphasis added).  Even if we were to agree with this assertion, it is not enough, under the plain error standard, that the error could have changed the outcome.  We can find plain error only if the error must have done so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we address defendant's claim that Sposito's counsel would have undertaken a more vigorous and extensive cross-examination of Padova than did Marder's counsel.  We do not dispute that it would have been better to have Padova testify and be subject to cross-examination.  Given that he was not available, a fact defendant does not dispute, the question is whether his previous testimony should have been admitted.  This matter goes to the question of whether there were sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness.  As we have already discussed, defendant has failed to persuade this court that the district court's conclusion that such guarantees existed was plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's rulings on the STA claim and the evidence claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although the trial started on January 17, the parties agree that the filing of the January 13 motion to dismiss for violation of the STA tolled the STA clock</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Cf.

Gambino, 59 F.3d 353, 357-59 (2d Cir.1995) (ruling that the STA clock is \"not tolled when the postponement of a pretrial motion until after trial does not effect a trial court's ability to proceed\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1671, 134 L.Ed.2d 776 (1996).

I think holding the motion to resolve once I have found that there was not going to be a plea, and apparently there won't be, is consistent with [Henderson ].\"  However one may interpret these remarks, they do not amount to an explicit relegation of the motion in limine to dormant status</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In addition to these requirements, the statement must also have \"equivalent guarantees of trustworthiness.\"  Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(5)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> But see United States v.

It is not for us, however, to conduct a plenary review of the district court's determination regarding the reliability of the testimony or to review every factor considered by the district court.

If the defendant is not brought to trial within the seventy day time period, \"the information or indictment shall be dismissed on motion of the defendant.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3162(a)(2);  see Rodriguez, 63 F.3d at 1162.   Not every day between the indictment or appearance and the start of trial is counted, however.  Section 3161(h) provides a list of circumstances in which the STA is tolled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question before us, therefore, is whether seventy countable days passed between the indictment of Sposito on April 13, 1994, and the start of the trial on January 17, 1995.  There are several periods of time in dispute, but we need only consider the last of these--from December 1, 1994 to January 13, 1995.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Defendant states that 41 countable days passed prior to December 1, 1994.  Because we find that there were no countable days from December 1, 1994 to January 13, 1995, defendant's claim under the STA must fail, regardless of how we would rule on the earlier periods.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 30, 1994, the previously scheduled trial date of December 12 was postponed indefinitely.  At that time, the government's motion in limine to restrict the cross-examination of certain law enforcement witnesses, filed on November 8, was pending.  The motion in limine was eventually heard during the trial, with argument on the motion taking place on January 31, 1995.  We must decide whether the motion in limine tolled the STA clock from November 8 to January 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three principal sources of authority frame our decision.  First, there is the statute, which requires that \"delay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of, such motion\" be excluded from the time counted against the STA.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(1)(F).  Congress chose not to include any explicit exceptions in the statutory language.  Yet Congress was conscious of the possible need for more flexible exclusion requirements, as demonstrated by other parts of the statute.  For example, in section 3161(h)(8)(A), the Act excludes periods of delay resulting from a continuance, but only when the trial court sets forth, in the record, its reasons for finding that \"the ends of justice served by taking such action outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(8)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, in Henderson v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111670\"><a href=\"/opinion/111670/henderson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span>, 327, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111670\"><a href=\"/opinion/111670/henderson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></a></span> (1986), the Supreme Court held that \"Congress intended subsection (F) to exclude from the Speedy Trial Act's 70-day limitation all time between the filing of a motion and the conclusion of the hearing on that motion, whether or not a delay in holding that hearing is 'reasonably necessary.' \"  Id.  In Henderson, a motion to suppress was filed on November 3, 1980, and a hearing was held on March 25, 1981, at which the trial court \"declined to reach a final decision because it needed further information.  The court did not receive all filings in connection with the motion until December 15, 1981.\"  Id. at 332, 106 S.Ct. at 1877-78 (citations omitted).  The Court excluded all of this time under section 3161(h)(8)(F).  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we are bound by our own ruling in United States v. Rojo-Alvarez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"568494\"><a href=\"/opinion/568494/united-states-v-alvaro-rojo-alvarez-united-states-v-adalberto/\"><span class=\"volume\">944</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">959</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1991).  In Rojo-Alvarez, the government filed a motion in limine on March 8, 1990.  On April 5, 1990, the district court reserved ruling on the merits of the motion until trial.  On appeal, this court stated that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>[w]e do not believe that a court should put off consideration of a motion and exclude the time during which the motion lies dormant.  However, when the court is presented with papers styled as a motion, whether it ultimately determines that the filing is a pretrial motion or an 'other proceeding' under (J), the court is entitled to exclude at least the period of time during which it considers how to treat the filing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 966.   The court in Rojo-Alvarez disposed of the case by excluding the time between the filing of the motion and the date upon which it was reserved.  The panel's language regarding the time a motion lies dormant did not affect the outcome of the case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, the government filed its motion in limine on November 8, 1994.  As an initial matter, motions in limine are \"pretrial motions\" for the purposes of section 3161(h)(1)(F), implying that the filing of such a motion tolls the STA clock.  See id.;   see also United States v. Santoyo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532782\"><a href=\"/opinion/532782/united-states-v-marco-anthony-santoyo/\"><span class=\"volume\">890</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">726</span></a></span>, 728 (5th Cir.1989);  United States v. Johnson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"676108\"><a href=\"/opinion/676108/united-states-v-benjamin-g-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></a></span>, 306 (7th Cir.1994).  The motion was not heard until January 31, 1995, well after the start of trial.  Between the filing of the motion and the trial date, the court made no mention of the motion in limine.  Specifically, it did not, at any time, state that it considered the motion \"dormant.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant-appellant contends that the district court implicitly relegated the motion to dormant status when it postponed the trial indefinitely.  He argues that \"[u]pon the issuance by the Court on November 30 of the Notice cancelling the December 12 trial date without the setting of a new trial date, and because of that Notice, it was then apparent that the Court's other business and or convenience had put the Sposito case on hold.\"   Appellant's Brief at 25.  Appellant then appeals to Rojo-Alvarez for the proposition that time during which motions lie dormant is to be counted against the STA clock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree with appellant's claim.  In our view, the motion was never relegated to dormant status for STA purposes.  The order postponing the trial read, in its entirety, \"[t]he trial scheduled to begin December 12, 1994 has been canceled.  It will be rescheduled for a future date to be advised.\"   District Court Order of Cancellation, November 30, 1994.  No reason was given for the postponement and there was no suggestion that the motion in limine had been reserved until trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To find that the motion was dormant, therefore, we would have to rely on speculative inferences about the statements and actions of the lower court.  We decline to do so.  We are unwilling to adopt the position that appellate courts should sit in review of the day-to-day operation of district courts in order to determine when a district court's decision to put off consideration of a motion makes that motion \"dormant\" and when it does not.  District courts are busy and must constantly make scheduling decisions with respect to the many matters for which they are responsible.  We are ill equipped to second guess these decisions.  There is no reliable way for an appellate court to divine the intent of the district court with respect to a particular motion or its docket in general.  Rather than open the door to appeals that ask this court to read the tea leaves of a trial's scheduling orders, we will only look to the explicit statements of the lower court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our ruling today is also based on our interpretation of the STA and Henderson.   On the one hand, neither of these sources suggests that dormant motions fail to trigger excludable time under subsection (F).  On the other hand, we recognize that there may be sound policy reasons for an exception to subsection (F) in the case of dormant motions.  Because the statute does not itself create such an exception, however, and because Henderson held that even unreasonable delays shall be excluded, any exception for dormant motions should at the very least be drawn narrowly.  We do not believe that an exception for motions deemed, by an appellate court, to have been dormant, without any explicit indication to that effect by the district court, would be consistent with the strong language of the STA and Henderson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, from the point of view of an appellate court, there does not appear to be a principled distinction between a motion that is dormant and one for which the period of delay prior to hearing is unreasonable.  In other words, finding a motion to have been dormant without any language to that effect in the record will often be similar to concluding that there has been unreasonable delay.  Henderson has established that all delay, even if unreasonable, is excluded.  To count time against the STA clock on the ground that the motion was implicitly relegated to dormant status, therefore, would be contrary to the spirit of Henderson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hasten to add that this opinion should not be taken either to criticize or to support the language in Rojo-Alvarez concerning dormant motions.  See Rojo-Alvarez, 944 F.2d at 966.   Our holding only extends to the question of whether or not the district court reserved ruling on the motion or otherwise relegated the motion to dormant status.  We do not comment in any way on the implications, for Speedy Trial Act purposes, of an explicit ruling that a motion is dormant or that the court will reserve ruling on the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of our ruling, the 43 days from December 1 to January 13 are not counted for STA purposes.  In light of the fact that appellant claims only 41 days were counted against the STA clock prior to December 1994, our finding implies that we must affirm the district court's ruling on the STA issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. The Admission of Evidence Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant-appellant next alleges that the district court erred in admitting into evidence the prior testimony of Louis Padova.  Padova had testified in October 1992, under a compulsion and immunity order, at the trial of Arthur Marder, who was accused of illegal gambling.  At Marder's trial, Padova testified that Marder had told him that he was paying everyone--the implication being that Marder paid off local Revere politicians in order to protect his illegal video poker business.  It was alleged that these payments were made via Sposito.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At Sposito's trial, Padova refused to testify, even with immunity, and was found in contempt.  The government moved to admit Padova's testimony from the prior Marder trial.  The district court found Padova to be unavailable within the meaning of Federal Rule of Evidence 804(a)(2) and found the previous testimony to be admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(5).  Appellant contests the Rule 804(b)(5) ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The proper interpretation of the Federal Rules of Evidence is a question of law and is reviewed de novo, see Texaco Puerto Rico v.

If that fact is proven, it increases the likelihood that he was paying off those politicians through Mr. Sposito.\"   2/7 Tr. 15.

If it is a material fact, Padova's testimony would be admissible, even under defendant's preferred interpretation of the rule.  To conclude, as defendant does, that the question of whether Marder was paying politicians is material fact and yet the fact that he stated as much to Padova is not a material fact is an exceedingly fine distinction, and not one upon which the question of admissibility should turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relationship between subparagraphs (A) and (B) of Rule 804(b)(5) appears to be a matter of first impression within the circuit.  We begin, as always, with an examination of the plain language of the rule.  Subsection (B) requires only that the statement be more probative on \"the point for which it is offered.\"   The subparagraph does not include the words \"of material fact\" as advocated by defendant.  The drafters of Rule 804(b)(5) separated the \"material fact\" element of the test found in subparagraph (A) from the \"more probative\" element of subparagraph (B).  Were the rule intended to have the meaning advocated by defendant, it could have been written with much greater clarity.  Had the drafters wanted to include the words \"of material fact\" following the word \"point\" in subparagraph (B) they obviously could have done so.  Furthermore, by doing so, they would have eliminated the need for subparagraph (A) because the necessity of a material fact would be explicit in the revised subparagraph (B).  As written, however, the plain language of the rule does not require that the issue on which the statement is most probative be a material fact;  it requires only that it be probative on the point \"for which it is offered.\"  Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(5)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, subparagraph (A) requires only that the statement be offered as evidence of a material fact.  It need not itself be a material fact.  If we were to import language from subparagraph (A) to subparagraph (B), it would be more natural to add the words \"of evidence\" after the word \"point,\" such that (B) read, \"the statement is more probative on the point of evidence for which it is offered than any other evidence.\"   Under this interpretation, appellant's claim would fail.  The district court established that the statement was offered as evidence of the fact that Marder was paying off politicians and that the latter was a point of material fact.  The statement is more probative on that point of evidence--what Marder told Padova--than any other evidence that the government could procure through reasonable efforts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant, perhaps recognizing that the language of the rule is not favorable to his argument, turns to legislative history.  He points to language in the Senate Report to the effect that the residual hearsay exception should be used rarely.  S.Rep. No. 1277, 93d Cong., 2nd Sess.  (1974), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1974, p.7051.  Our own examination of the legislative history, however, reveals that the inclusion of the residual hearsay exception was intended for cases, such as the one before us, that \"have guarantees of trustworthiness equivalent to or exceeding the guarantees reflected by the [other Rule 804(b) ] exceptions, and to have a high degree of prolativeness [sic].\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to illustrate the type of evidence that the Senate Committee felt should be admitted but that may not fall within one of the other hearsay exceptions, the Senate Report cited Dallas County v. Commercial Union Assurance Company, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"252947\"><a href=\"/opinion/252947/dallas-county-v-commercial-union-assurance-company-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">286</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">388</span></a></span> (5th Cir.1961).  S.Rep. No. 1277.  At issue in that case was the cause of the collapse of the Dallas County Courtroom clock tower.  Insurance investigators believed that it collapsed due to structural defects.  Dallas County believed that the tower collapsed as a result of being struck by a bolt of lightning.  In support of its position, the County introduced into evidence, among other things, charcoal and charred timbers found in the tower debris.  Id. at 390.   In order to rebut this evidence, the insurers sought to introduce a newspaper article from 1901 describing a fire that had occurred in the courtroom in that year.  The court admitted the evidence despite the fact that it was not characterized \"as a 'business record', nor as an 'ancient document', nor as any other readily identifiable and happily tagged species of hearsay exception.\"  Id. at 398.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Senate Report stated that \"[b]ecause exceptional cases like the Dallas County case may arise in the future, the committee has decided to reinstate a residual exception for rules 803 and 804(b).\"   S.Rep. No. 1277, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1974, p.7066.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under defendant's construction of the residual hearsay exception, however, the newspaper article in Dallas County would not be admissible.  The newspaper article was introduced as evidence of the material fact that the charred timbers were the result of a fire that took place more than fifty years prior to the case.  The newspaper story did not, however, go directly to the question of why the charred timbers were in the tower, it only went to the fact that there had been a fire in 1901.  The story was not more probative on the point of why the timbers were charred than any other evidence.  It was, however, more probative than any other evidence that the insurers could provide on the question of whether there had been a fire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just as in the case at bar, therefore, a requirement that the statement be more probative on the point of material fact than other available evidence would exclude the evidence in question.  This is certainly not what the Senate Committee, which used the Dallas County case as an example of evidence that was correctly admitted, intended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we turn to the policies served by the residual hearsay exception.  These can be summarized as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>1.  To provide sufficient flexibility to permit the courts to deal with new and unanticipated situations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>2. To preserve the integrity of the specifically enumerated exceptions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>3. To facilitate the basic purpose of the Federal Rules of Evidence:  truth ascertainment and fair adjudication of controversies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">11 Moore's Federal Practice &#167; 803(24) (2d ed. 1994 &amp; Supp.1996-97).  It is our view that these objectives are best served by rejecting defendant's proposed construction of 804(b)(5).  The defendant's proposed interpretation would needlessly reduce the flexibility available to courts dealing with new and unanticipated situations.  By excluding evidence that has, as required by 804(b)(5), \"equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness,\" defendant's proposed interpretation would also make truth ascertainment and the fair adjudication of justice unnecessarily difficult.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the above reasons, we decline to adopt the defendant's reading of subparagraphs (A) and (B), and we conclude that the district court did not err, as a matter of law, in its interpretation of Rule 804(b)(5)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We examine the district court's application of the rule.  Defendant-appellant claims that the admission of Padova's testimony was erroneous because the district court failed to analyze each part of the testimony in order to determine each part's reliability.  In support of his claim, defendant cites Williamson v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117868\"><a href=\"/opinion/117868/williamson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">594</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117868\"><a href=\"/opinion/117868/williamson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Defendant would have us apply the same definition of \"statement\" to Rule 804(b)(5) and, under such a definition, he argues that the district court failed to analyze each part of the testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note initially that defendant failed to raise this issue at trial.

If Williamson 's definition of \"statement\" does not apply, defendant's claim is without merit because we find no plain error in the district court's review of the testimony as a whole--viewing it as a single statement--and its determination that the requirements of Rule 804(b)(5) were satisfied.  The district court concluded that the testimony included adequate guarantees of trustworthiness because it was given under oath, because Padova was immunized, because he testified upon personal knowledge, and because he was vigorously cross-examined by defense counsel in the Marder trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  These indicia of reliability are sufficient to establish that the district court's conclusion that the testimony was reliable was not plain error.  The district court also found subparagraphs (A) through (C) satisfied, and we find no plain error in its analysis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If Williamson applies, our analysis becomes more complicated.  The district court does not appear to have engaged in a sentence-by-sentence analysis of the testimony, as would be required by Williamson.   The indicators of reliability that the district court used, however, are not specific to any portion of the testimony and would apply to every statement therein, implying that there is no error with respect to the reliability of the testimony.  Specifically, the district court stated that \"Mr. Padova testified at the Marder trial under oath, he was immunized and, therefore, had an incentive to tell the truth in order to avoid prosecution for perjury.  He testified based upon personal knowledge.\"   The judge also noted that \"he was vigorously cross-examined by Mr. Duggan, the defense counsel.\"   Tr. 2/7 14-15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had the trial court conducted a sentence-by-sentence analysis, therefore, it would have applied these same criteria to every sentence and would have concluded that each one had sufficient indicators of reliability.  There was, therefore, no plain error in the assessment of the reliability of the testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to subparagraphs (A)-(C) of Rule 804(b)(5), however, not every sentence of the testimony is admissible.  For example, not every sentence in that testimony can be said to have been offered as evidence of a material fact.  For this reason, assuming, arguendo, that Williamson applies, the district court's ruling was erroneous.  The error was not, however, \"plain,\" as required by Winter.   In order to be considered plain, the error must be \"so 'plain' that the trial judge and prosecutor were derelict in countenancing it, even absent the defendant's timely assistance in detecting it.\"  United States v. Frady, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110693\"><a href=\"/opinion/110693/united-states-v-frady/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">152</span></a></span>, 163, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110693\"><a href=\"/opinion/110693/united-states-v-frady/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">816</span></a></span> (1982).  The error in this case was not sufficiently clear as to rise to the level of a plain error.  The error, if it existed at all, turns on the interpretation and application of Williamson to a case dealing with a hearsay exception that was not implicated in Williamson.   No cases are on point in this circuit, and the issue was not raised at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, even if we concluded that there was plain error, the defendant still must show that the error affected \"substantial rights.\"   In order to affect substantial rights, the error \"must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\"  Olano, 507 U.S. at 734, 113 S.Ct. at 1778.   The analysis is the same as a \"harmless error\" analysis, except that \"[i]t is the defendant rather than the Government who bears the burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice.\"  Id.  Defendant in the instant case has failed to demonstrate that the error affected the outcome of the proceedings.  Indeed, defendant-appellant's brief pursues only a harmful error argument and concludes that \"Padova's testimony ... very well could have tipped the scales.\"   Appellant's Brief at 44 (emphasis added).  Even if we were to agree with this assertion, it is not enough, under the plain error standard, that the error could have changed the outcome.  We can find plain error only if the error must have done so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we address defendant's claim that Sposito's counsel would have undertaken a more vigorous and extensive cross-examination of Padova than did Marder's counsel.  We do not dispute that it would have been better to have Padova testify and be subject to cross-examination.  Given that he was not available, a fact defendant does not dispute, the question is whether his previous testimony should have been admitted.  This matter goes to the question of whether there were sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness.  As we have already discussed, defendant has failed to persuade this court that the district court's conclusion that such guarantees existed was plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

It is not for us, however, to conduct a plenary review of the district court's determination regarding the reliability of the testimony or to review every factor considered by the district court.
