Berkovitz challenges  the district  court's\r\n\nspontaneous entry of judgment in favor of the defendants Home Box\r\n\nOffice, Inc.  (HBO)  and Viacom  International,  Inc.  (Viacom).1\r\n\nAlthough  we   applaud  the  district   court's  innovative  case\r\n\nmanagement and  its Briarean  efforts to  refine  the issues  for\r\n\ntrial,  we believe  that in  one crucial  respect the  court went\r\n\nawry.    Consequently, we  vacate  the  judgment  and remand  for\r\n\nfurther proceedings.\r\n\nI.  FACTUAL PREDICATE\r          I.  FACTUAL PREDICATE\r\n\n          We frame the facts in the aspect most beneficial to the\r\n\nparty  against   whom  the  district   court  entered   judgment,\r\n\nconsistent  with record  support.   See, e.g.,  Quaker  State Oil\r                                                                           \r\n\nRefining Corp. v. Garrity Oil Co., 884 F.2d  1510, 1513 (1st Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1989).\r\n\n          In early 1984, Berkovitz  hit upon an idea for  a cable\r\n\ntelevision channel.   He  dubbed this concept  \"The Entertainment\r\n\nNetwork\" (or, for short, \"the TEN plan\").  The concept envisioned\r\n\na  round-the-clock  commercial  television  channel  highlighting\r\n\nlesser-known musical and comedic acts supplemented by talk shows,\r\n\nmovies,  and other  staples.   The  concept embodied  interactive\r\n\nfeatures through which the  viewing audience could participate in\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1We   omit  particularized  reference  to  two  parties  who\r\nnecessarily  stand or  fall  with parties  whom  we have  already\r\nmentioned.   The  omitted  parties are  plaintiff  KDK, Inc.  (an\r\ninactive  corporation controlled by  Berkovitz) and defendant MTV\r\nNetworks (a wholly-owned subsidiary  of Viacom).  Notwithstanding\r\nthis  exercise of literary  license, our opinion  is binding upon\r\nall the litigants.\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\ncontests and offer programming suggestions telephonically.\r\n\n          In February 1985,  Berkovitz offered a copy  of the TEN\r\n\nplan  to an HBO vice  president, Larry Carlson,  who accepted the\r\n\noffer.  He then  sent the document (which, like  all other copies\r\n\nof the TEN plan mentioned herein, bore  the legend \"confidential\"\r\n\non its cover page) to Carlson.  Approximately three months later,\r\n\nHBO disclaimed any interest and returned the submission (although\r\n\nBerkovitz intimates that  HBO retained  a copy).   In July  1987,\r\n\nBerkovitz  attempted to  interest Viacom  in the  TEN plan.   The\r\n\nchairman's secretary suggested that he forward a copy to  Viacom.\r\n\nHe claims to  have done  so (on  the express  condition that  the\r\n\nsubmission  was \"for [the chairman's] eyes only.\"  He also claims\r\n\nto  have furnished extra copies  at Viacom's request  and to have\r\n\nmet with an MTV vice-president, Lee Masters,  anent the proposal.\r\n\nAlthough Masters \"raved\" about  certain aspects of the plan,  the\r\n\nmeeting came to naught.\r\n\n          Little daunted, Berkovitz resumed his courtship of HBO.\r\n\nDuring the  fall of  1987 he  met with Carlson,  who,   Berkovitz\r\n\nmaintains, perused the TEN  plan, praised it, agreed to  keep its\r\n\ncontents in confidence,  and led  him to believe  that HBO  would\r\n\nhelp launch the  new enterprise  and share the  fruits with  him.\r\n\nDespite   these   encomia,  and   several   subsequent  telephone\r\n\nconversations in the same vein, HBO never followed through.2\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2Not  surprisingly,  Carlson  disputes  this  account.    He\r\ntestified during  a deposition that  he found both  Berkovitz and\r\nthe  TEN plan lacking in  focus; hence, he  refrained from making\r\nany commitments.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\n          HBO  inaugurated \"The  Comedy Channel\"  in November  of\r\n\n1989.    Viacom  shortly followed  suit  with  \"Ha!   The  Comedy\r\n\nNetwork.\"   Late  in  1990  the  two  merged  to  become  \"Comedy\r\n\nCentral.\"  Berkovitz  insists that these offerings all drew their\r\n\ninspiration from  the TEN plan, and  that they did so  in blatant\r\n\ndisregard of his proprietary rights.\r\n\nII.  TRAVEL OF THE CASE\r          II.  TRAVEL OF THE CASE\r\n\n          The  procedural  aspects  of  this  litigation  are  of\r\n\ndecretory significance.  We divide our account into two parts.\r\n\n                     A.  Initial Proceedings.\r                               A.  Initial Proceedings.\r                                                      \r\n\n          Invoking  diversity  jurisdiction,  28  U.S.C.    1332,\r\n\nBerkovitz filed  suit in federal  district court  on January  28,\r\n\n1991.    Judge Skinner  drew the  case.   In  the  complaint, the\r\n\nplaintiff alleged that HBO and Viacom pirated his concept without\r\n\ncompensating him,  unjustly enriched  themselves at  his expense,\r\n\nbreached implied-in-fact contracts  to pay him  if they used  the\r\n\nTEN  plan   to  productive  ends,  and   committed  unfair  trade\r\n\npractices.  The defendants denied these allegations.\r\n\n          The novelty (or lack  thereof) of the TEN plan  and its\r\n\nconstituent  elements   soon  became   a   protuberant  bone   of\r\n\ncontention.  The defendants, positing that New York's substantive\r\n\nlaw governed, maintained  that Berkovitz had to prove the novelty\r\n\nof his idea in  order to recover  under any actionable theory  of\r\n\nthe  case.    Berkovitz, positing  that  the  substantive  law of\r\n\nMassachusetts  governed, attempted  to parry  this thrust  on two\r\n\nlevels:   he asserted both that  his idea was in  fact novel, and\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nthat  in all events a plaintiff whose idea was misappropriated in\r\n\ncontravention  of  an  implied-in-fact contract  need  not  prove\r\n\nnovelty in order to recover.\r\n\n          In time,  the  defendants moved  for summary  judgment.\r\n\nJudge  Skinner considered  the  parties' arguments  and  reserved\r\n\ndecision.   In a rescript  dated May 18,  1994, he held  (1) that\r\n\nMassachusetts  law  supplies  the  rule  of  decision,  (2)  that\r\n\nMassachusetts  does not  require a  showing  of novelty  when the\r\n\nplaintiff alleges  the existence  of a  contractual relationship,\r\n\nand (3) that the defendants' motions for summary judgment  should\r\n\ntherefore  be denied on all but the unfair trade practices claim.\r\n\nThe court entered an appropriate order.\r\n\n                  B.  The Pretrial Conferences.\r                            B.  The Pretrial Conferences.\r                                                        \r\n\n          After Judge Skinner elected  senior status, many of his\r\n\ncases were redrawn.  Judge Keeton assumed responsibility for this\r\n\ncase   in  mid-1994.      Although  the   defendants  moved   for\r\n\nreconsideration  of  the earlier  denial  of  brevis disposition,\r                                                              \r\n\nJudge Keeton did not act upon these motions.  He instead convened\r\n\na series of pretrial conferences in a commendable effort to bring\r\n\nmatters  to a  head.  During  the last  four conferences  (all of\r\n\nwhich  took place in 1995), the  judge concentrated on clarifying\r\n\nand delimiting the issues  to be tried.  Because the  events that\r\n\ntranspired at  these conferences shed considerable  light on this\r\n\nappeal, we set out a brief chronology.\r\n\n          1.   The March  21 Conference.   The first  of the four\r                    1.   The March  21 Conference.\r                                                 \r\n\nconferences  focused  primarily  on  the  parties'  agreement  to\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nbifurcate  the  trial, separating  the  issues  of liability  and\r\n\ndamages.    But Judge  Keeton  also  seized this  opportunity  to\r\n\ninstruct the parties to spell out their legal  theories (avoiding\r\n\nforensic jargon),  and directed  them to  develop a verdict  form\r\n\nsuitable for submission to a jury.3\r\n\n          2.   The April 27  Conference.  At  the next conference\r                    2.   The April 27  Conference.\r                                                 \r\n\nthe  parties wrangled over a  proposed verdict form.   The debate\r\n\nled  Judge Keeton  to remark  that \"we're  going to  have to  get\r\n\nspecific\" about what elements of the TEN plan were \"substantially\r\n\nused\" by the defendants.  The judge explained that this degree of\r\n\nparticularization would  assist  in \"structuring  the claims  and\r\n\ndefenses  so  that  I  can  understand  them,  so  the  jury  can\r\n\nunderstand  them, [and]  so that  [the litigants]  can understand\r\n\neach other.\"\r\n\n          3.  The June 1 Conference.  At the third conference the\r                    3.  The June 1 Conference.\r                                             \r\n\njudge cautioned that  he would not allow the jury  to consider \"a\r\n\nfuzzy claim\"  and urged the plaintiff's  lawyer to \"communicat[e]\r\n\nto me  clearly . . . your legal  and factual theory.\"  After some\r\n\nadditional  discourse (during which the defendants unsuccessfully\r\n\nsought  leave  to  file  fresh  motions  for  summary  judgment),\r\n\nplaintiff's counsel  reformulated his position.   He pledged that\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3In the course of  this conference, plaintiff's lead counsel\r\nmade  his first attempt to spell out his implied contract theory.\r\nHe suggested that there are  several elements:  \"one is,  did Mr.\r\nBerkovitz come up with the idea? . . .  Two, did he submit  it to\r\nthe defendants?  Three is, did they use  it? . . .  Four is,  did\r\nhe submit it . . . to them in a context in which one can imply  a\r\npromise to  pay for it if  they use it? .  . .  And  then if [the\r\njurors] answer all of those correctly, I would say under that one\r\ntheory of the case, then you go to damages . . . .\"\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nhe  would prove  (1) an implied  agreement between  Berkovitz and\r\n\neach of  the defendants  for confidential  disclosure of  the TEN\r\n\nplan, and  (2)  the  defendants'  appropriation of  the  plan  in\r\n\nderogation  of this agreement.   The court reiterated its concern\r\n\nthat this reformulation did not  enumerate which elements of  the\r\n\nplan  were novel  and  which were  used  by the  defendants.   In\r\n\naddition,  the  court  asked  the  plaintiff to  list  the  legal\r\n\nelements of  his implied-in-fact contract claim,  and plaintiff's\r\n\ncounsel agreed to try again.\r\n\n          4.   The July 18 Conference.   The plaintiff's outright\r                    4.   The July 18 Conference.\r                                               \r\n\nabandonment  of any cause of action based on the putative novelty\r\n\nof any of the  elements contained in  the TEN plan dominated  the\r\n\nearly stages of the final conference.  Novelty aside, the defense\r\n\nmaintained  that  the  plaintiff  still  had  not  specified  the\r\n\nelements  of his  remaining implied  contract claim.4   The court\r\n\nreaffirmed its desire  that Berkovitz state  his cause of  action\r\n\nwith  particularity.    Noting  that  Berkovitz's  proposed  jury\r\n\ninstructions, if given, would  require the jury to find  that HBO\r\n\nand/or Viacom made \"substantial  use\" of the TEN plan,  the court\r\n\nasked Berkovitz to specify what this portended.\r\n\n          More   discussion  ensued,   but  the   judge  remained\r\n\ndissatisfied;  he reminded  Berkovitz's counsel  that he  had the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4Following the parties' lead,  we use \"implied contract\" and\r\nwords of  like import as a  rubric to cover not  only plaintiff's\r\nimplied  contract claim but also his embedded claim for breach of\r\nfiduciary duty.   Both claims  have a common  denominator:   they\r\nrequire proof of an agreement or duty to hold Berkovitz's idea in\r\nconfidence, and to compensate him for its unauthorized use.\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nauthority to require a plaintiff to state with particularity  the\r\n\ntheory underpinning his  claim, and warned that  he might dismiss\r\n\nthe  case  because  Berkovitz  had  failed  to  comply  with  the\r\n\nparticularization  orders.    The  defendants  moved  orally  for\r\n\nsummary judgment on  the ground that all the elements  of the TEN\r\n\nplan were in the public domain.  The court  expressed no interest\r\n\nin strolling down this road, and the oral motions languished.\r\n\n          In a last-ditch effort  to satisfy the court's demands,\r\n\nBerkovitz's attorney again attempted  to articulate his theory of\r\n\nthe  case.    The  lawyer delineated  what he  termed Berkovitz's\r\n\nposition \"from day one\":  Berkovitz gave the defendants copies of\r\n\nthe TEN  plan under circumstances  in which  a reasonable  person\r\n\nwould  expect compensation if they  (or either of  them) used his\r\n\nwork product.  Thus, if a defendant had  made some beneficial use\r\n\nof some part  of that  document, Berkovitz would  be entitled  to\r\n\nrelief.  The court described this iteration of Berkovitz's theory\r\n\nas postulating  an  \"all factors\"  approach  because it  did  not\r\n\ndifferentiate  among the elements of  the TEN plan  (e.g., it did\r\n\nnot single  out which  elements  the plaintiff  claimed had  been\r\n\nmisappropriated and used).  After  expressing its belief that the\r\n\napproach probably was \"incorrect  as a matter of law,\"  the court\r\n\nentered  an interlocutory  judgment for  the defendants  but gave\r\n\nBerkovitz \"time for filing something more.\"\r\n\n          5.     The  Court's  Final  Order.    Berkovitz     who\r                    5.     The  Court's  Final  Order.\r                                                     \r\n\napparently believed that the  court had entered the interlocutory\r\n\njudgment  either   as  a  sanction  for   failure  adequately  to\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nparticularize  his claim  or because it  found the  \"all factors\"\r\n\napproach legally infirm    moved for reconsideration.   The court\r\n\ndenied the motion and  entered final judgment.  See  Berkovitz v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nHBO, 1995 WL 791939,  at *10 (D. Mass.  Oct. 23, 1995).   In this\r             \r\n\norder the court clarified the basis on which the judgment rested;\r\n\nin its view, Berkovitz's claim lacked factual grounding.  See id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nat  *5.    Consequently,   the  court  terminated  the   case  on\r\n\nsubstantive grounds.

First,  we\r\n\nexamine the lower  court's final  order and explain  why we  deem\r\n\nthat order to be a species of sua sponte summary judgment.  Next,\r\n\nwe delineate the  legal standards that pertain to such judgments.\r\n\nFinally, we dispose of the appeal.\r\n\n       A.  Characterizing the District Court's Final Order.\r                 A.  Characterizing the District Court's Final Order.\r                                                                    \r\n\n          We find no fault with the judge's decision to convene a\r\n\nseries of  pretrial conferences  devoted largely to  refining the\r\n\nissues  and ascertaining  which issues  were fit  for the  jury's\r\n\nconsumption.   Federal district  courts enjoy wide  discretion in\r\n\ntheir crafting of  the pretrial process, see,  e.g., Cleveland v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nPiper  Aircraft Corp.,  985  F.2d 1438,  1450 (10th  Cir.), cert.\r                                                                           \r\n\ndenied, 114 S.

In a\r\n\nrelated vein, courts may use case management tools to advance the\r\n\nimportant purpose of affording \"the opposing party fair notice of\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nthe  claims asserted against him  and the grounds  on which those\r\n\nclaims rest.\"  Rodriguez  v. Doral Mortgage Corp., 57  F.3d 1168,\r                                                           \r\n\n1171 (1st Cir. 1995).\r\n\n          In  this instance,  the court  made adroit  use  of its\r\n\npowers and  succeeded in  winnowing the plaintiff's  claims until\r\n\nonly  one claim remained   the implied contract claim premised on\r\n\nthe \"all factors\" approach.   There are three  possibilities that\r\n\nmight explain why  the court entered judgment in  the defendants'\r\n\nfavor on this last claim:  (1) the claim may have depended upon a\r\n\nflawed legal theory, or (2) it  may have been stated too  loosely\r\n\n(in defiance of the court's  particularization orders), or (3) it\r\n\nmay  have lacked a sufficient evidentiary  predicate.  Though the\r\n\ncourt criticized  the \"all factors\" approach  in various respects\r\n\nat various times, careful perscrutation of the  final order rules\r\n\nout two of these  possibilities.  As to legal  insufficiency, the\r\n\ncourt  stated that  it had  \"[a]ssum[ed], without  deciding, that\r\n\n[the  \"all  factors\"  approach  upon  which  Berkovitz's  implied\r\n\ncontract claim depends] is indeed a correct interpretation of the\r\n\nlaw  in Massachusetts.\"   Berkovitz,  supra, at  *5.   As to  the\r                                                     \r\n\nparticularization orders, the court vouchsafed that the plaintiff\r\n\ndid not violate these orders by failing to furnish a more precise\r\n\nstatement of his implied contract claim.  See id. at *9.\r                                                           \r\n\n          This   leaves  the  third   possibility:    evidentiary\r\n\ninsufficiency.  Unlike the other  possibilities, that explanation\r\n\nis  strengthened by the  language of the final  order.  The court\r\n\nwrote \"that the plaintiff  has provided no evidence from  which a\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\njury could decide  . . . that in  this case factual circumstances\r\n\nsupporting . . .  a duty [of confidentiality] arose at some point\r\n\nduring the negotiations  of the parties.\"  Id. at  *5.  Along the\r                                                        \r\n\nsame lines, the court  added that \"[a] jury could  not reasonably\r\n\nfind, on this evidence, that factual conditions prerequisite to a\r\n\ncontractual  or fiduciary  duty  existed  in  this  case.\"    Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nConsequently,   Berkovitz's  implied   contract  claim   did  not\r\n\n\"survive[] examination on the merits.\"  Id. at *9.\r                                                     \r\n\n            We  will not  paint the  lily.

Here, the order, fairly\r\n\nread,  discounts  the other  possibilities  and  disposes of  the\r\n\nplaintiff's implied contract claim on a substantive ground:  lack\r\n\nof evidence.  Accordingly, we are constrained to characterize the\r\n\ncourt's  action as a spontaneous grant of summary judgment rather\r\n\nthan as a  dismissal for  either legal insufficiency  or want  of\r\n\ncompliance with case management orders.\r\n\n         B.

To  this end, we have placed two conditions\r\n\non  unbesought  summary  judgments.    First,  a  district  court\r\n\nordinarily may order summary judgment on its  own initiative only\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5A district  court also  may grant partial  summary judgment\r\nsua  sponte, removing some (but  fewer than all)  of the parties'\r\nclaims or defenses from the case.  See, e.g., Hubbard  v. Parker,\r                                                                          \r\n994  F.2d 529,  530  (8th Cir.  1993);  National Expo.,  Inc.  v.\r                                                                       \r\nCrowley Maritime Corp., 824 F.2d 131, 133 (1st Cir. 1987).\r                                \r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nwhen  discovery is  sufficiently advanced  that the  parties have\r\n\nenjoyed  a reasonable  opportunity to  glean the  material facts.\r\n\nSee  Stella, 4 F.3d  at 55;  Jardines Bacata,  878 F.2d  at 1561.\r                                                      \r\n\nSecond, the court may  enter summary judgment sua sponte  only if\r\n\nit first gives the targeted party appropriate notice and a chance\r\n\nto present its evidence on the essential elements of the claim or\r\n\ndefense.  See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 326; see also Jardines Bacata,\r                                                                          \r\n\n878 F.2d at 1561 (\"`Notice' in this context means that the losing\r\n\nparty .  . .  received a  fair opportunity to  put its  best foot\r\n\nforward.\").\r\n\n          These strictures are not peculiar to sua sponte summary\r\n\njudgments, but, rather, mirror the general principles that govern\r\n\nall  motions for  summary judgment.   See  Stella, 4  F.3d  at 56\r                                                           \r\n\n(noting that \"it is well settled in this circuit that all summary\r\n\njudgment proceedings,  including those initiated by  the district\r\n\njudge,  will be  held  to the  standards  enunciated in  Rule  56\r\n\nitself\"); Quaker  State, 884  F.2d at 1513  (explaining that  the\r                                 \r\n\ndistrict  court's power  to  order summary  judgment  on its  own\r\n\ninitiative must be exercised  \"according to the rigorous protocol\r\n\nof  Rule 56\").   This means, of  course, that a  nisi prius court\r\n\nmust give the  targeted party at least  ten days within  which to\r\n\nproffer  affidavits or other evidence  in response to the court's\r\n\nspecific concerns.  See Stella, 4 F.3d at 56.\r                                        \r\n\n          Appellate   review  is   equally   unaffected  by   the\r\n\nspontaneous  nature of  the trial  court's action.   As  with any\r\n\nother grant  of summary  judgment, the court  of appeals  affords\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\nplenary  review  to  a   decision  granting  sua  sponte  summary\r\n\njudgment,  and reads the record  in the light  most hospitable to\r\n\nthe targeted party.  See Quaker State, 884 F.2d at 1513.\r                                               \r\n\n                   C.  Applying the Standards.\r                             C.

We explain briefly.\r\n\n          When  a court  charts a  procedural route,  lawyers and\r\n\nlitigants are entitled to rely  on it.  A court cannot  alter its\r\n\nbearings mid-course  without signalling the  impending change  to\r\n\nthe parties.   See Foster-Miller,  Inc. v. Babcock  &amp; Wilcox,  46\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.3d  138,  148-49  (1st  Cir.  1995)  (pointing  out  that  this\r\n\nprinciple is  especially pertinent \"[w]hen judges  elect on their\r\n\nown  initiative  to  use  innovative  methods  in  an  effort  to\r\n\naccelerate  the progress  of a  case\"); Stella,  4 F.3d  at 55-56\r                                                        \r\n\n(applying  this  principle to  a  sua  sponte summary  judgment).\r\n\nHere,  the judge  obviously understood  the rule,  see Berkovitz,\r                                                                          \r\n\nsupra, at *2 (acknowledging the  court's obligation to afford \"an\r               \r\n\nopportunity  for counsel  opposing  the judgment  to proffer  all\r\n\nrelevant and  admissible evidence\"), and apparently  thought that\r\n\nhe had honored it.  See id. at *1 (describing the  particularity-\r                                     \r\n\nof-claim  orders  as requiring  Berkovitz \"to  proffer admissible\r\n\nevidence sufficient to support  the findings necessary to satisfy\r\n\nthe elements of  [his] legal  theory\"); id. at  *5 (stating  that\r                                                     \r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\nBerkovitz  was \"given  an opportunity  to proffer  any additional\r\n\nevidence  that might be material\").   Yet the  record simply does\r\n\nnot bear out the court's recollection.\r\n\n          One part  of the problem relates  to the particularity-\r\n\nof-claim  orders.   The  court did  not  reduce those  orders  to\r\n\nwriting,  but   delivered  them   ora  sponte  at   the  pretrial\r                                                       \r\n\nconferences   that  we   have  chronicled.      Nonetheless,  the\r\n\nconferences  took place in the  presence of a  court reporter and\r\n\ntranscripts  now  have  been  prepared.6   Whatever  the  court's\r\n\nintentions, its transcribed words do not require the plaintiff to\r\n\nproffer evidence of the existence of the implied contracts.\r\n\n          Another part of the problem is that the  district court\r\n\nappears to have  changed course without giving the targeted party\r\n\nsufficient forewarning.  When the court informed the plaintiff at\r\n\nthe  penultimate  (June  1) conference  that  it  might  enter an\r\n\nadverse judgment,  it linked this possibility  not to evidentiary\r\n\ninsufficiency but to  the plaintiff's  failure satisfactorily  to\r\n\ncomply with  the particularity-of-claim orders.   See id.  at *3.\r                                                                   \r\n\nAt  the last  conference  (July  18)  the court  reinforced  this\r\n\nlinkage by discussing  its entry of an  interlocutory judgment in\r\n\ntandem  with  its  comments   on  the  plaintiff's  inability  to\r\n\narticulate  avenues  of legal  relief  beyond  the \"all  factors\"\r\n\napproach.  See,  e.g., id.  In its  written opinion, however, the\r                                    \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6While the four conferences listed in our chronology were on\r\nthe  record,  the court  convened at  least one  other conference\r\n(November 21,  1994) for which  no transcript has  been supplied.\r\nThe clerk's notes  on the docket sheet regarding  this conference\r\nare unilluminating.\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\ncourt veered in  a different  direction.  It  explained that  the\r\n\nclaim  predicated on  the \"all  factors\" approach  would not  fly\r\n\nbecause \"the plaintiff has provided no evidence from which a jury\r                                                         \r\n\ncould decide, under any plausible interpretation of Massachusetts\r\n\ncases, that in this case factual circumstances  supporting such a\r                                                        \r\n\nduty  [of  confidentiality]  arose   at  some  point  during  the\r\n\nnegotiations of the  parties.\"   Id. at  *5 (emphasis  supplied).\r                                              \r\n\nPrior to  making  this ruling,  the  court had  neither  informed\r\n\nBerkovitz that it was considering a judgment based on evidentiary\r\n\ninsufficiency nor invited him to marshal and present his proof in\r\n\nrespect to the  existence vel non  of an  implied contract.7   To\r                                           \r\n\nthe contrary,  the court's  pre-ruling statements pointed  in the\r\n\nopposite  direction.    We cite  two  examples.   At  the  June 1\r\n\nconference plaintiff's counsel strove  to embellish the  elements\r\n\nof his  client's implied contract  claim.  The  court interrupted\r\n\nhim,  stating:   \"I don't want  to talk  about the  proof at this\r\n\npoint.  I just want to talk about the legal elements. . . .\"  The\r\n\nsecond  example is  drawn from  the July  18 semble;  the court's\r\n\ndeclaration  on  this occasion  that  the  plaintiff's claim  was\r\n\n\"incorrect as a  matter of law\"  tended to render any  proffer of\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     7We note  that all  parties initially  seem to have  assumed\r\nthat the trial court did not premise the sua sponte judgment on a\r\ndearth of  evidence.  The plaintiff's  motion for reconsideration\r\nmakes  manifest Berkovitz's  belief that the  court defenestrated\r\nthe  case either  as  a sanction  or  because the  \"all  factors\"\r\napproach  failed as  a matter  of law.   By  the same  token, the\r\ndefendants' oppositions to that motion did not attempt to justify\r\nthe  judgment   on  the   ground  that  there   were  evidentiary\r\ndeficiencies  related to  the plaintiff's  proof  of one  or more\r\ncontractual relationships.\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\nevidence supporting that claim nugatory.\r\n\n          The question that confronts us  is not whether the \"all\r\n\nfactors\" approach is (or  is not) legally sound.   Similarly, the\r\n\nquestion is not whether there is (or is not) adequate evidence in\r\n\nthe  record  to  defeat  summary judgment  on  the  \"all factors\"\r\n\napproach.   The question, rather,  is whether the  court gave the\r\n\nplaintiff  a meaningful  opportunity  to cull  the best  evidence\r\n\nsupporting his  position, and to present  that evidence, together\r\n\nwith developed legal argumentation, in opposition to the entry of\r\n\nsummary judgment.  See Stella, 4  F.3d at 55; Bonilla v.  Nazaro,\r                                                                          \r\n\n843 F.2d 34,  37 (1st Cir. 1988).  On this  record, we think that\r\n\nthe opportunity   if one existed   was too poorly defined.8\r\n\n          Nor  are  we comfortable  shifting  the  blame for  the\r\n\napparent  miscommunication to the  plaintiff.   To be  sure, this\r\n\ncourt  from time to time has refused to permit appellants to take\r\n\nadvantage  of supposed oversights that had not been called to the\r\n\ndistrict  court's  attention  by  way  of  a  timeous  motion  to\r\n\nreconsider.   See, e.g., United States v. Schaefer,     F.3d    ,\r                                                            \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     8There  are four reasons why it is not a satisfactory answer\r\nto  suggest that the plaintiff had an opportunity to proffer this\r\nevidence  in connection  with  the defendants'  original Rule  56\r\nmotions.   First,  the  defendants forswore  any reliance  on the\r\ninsufficiency  of such  evidence when  they filed  those motions.\r\nSecond, Judge Skinner  neither focused on nor purported to decide\r\nwhether  the plaintiff could prove  the existence of  one or more\r\nimplied contracts,  but, rather, assumed that  the defendants had\r\nentered into such  contracts.   Third, the contours  of the  case\r\nthereafter  changed  dramatically,  and Judge  Keeton  explicitly\r\ndeclined to rule on the defendants' pending motions to reconsider\r\nJudge  Skinner's order.  See  Berkovitz, supra, at  *3.  Finally,\r                                                        \r\nthe defendants' reconsideration motions (like their original Rule\r\n56  motions)   also  assumed  the  existence   of  the  requisite\r\ncontractual relationship.\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\n    n.9 (1st Cir. 1996) [No.95-2342, slip op. at 19 n.9]; Grenier\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.

But  here,  the  plaintiff  filed  a  motion  to\r\n\nreconsider,  raising all the  grounds that  were apparent  at the\r\n\ntime.    It  was  not  until  the  district  court ruled  on  the\r\n\nreconsideration  motion that  the  spotlight  suddenly  swung  to\r\n\nevidentiary insufficiency.    While the  plaintiff  theoretically\r\n\nmight  have filed  a second  motion for  reconsideration at  that\r                                     \r\n\ntime,  the appeal  period  was  running;  and, moreover,  we  are\r\n\nreluctant to fault a  suitor who, like Berkovitz, chooses  not to\r\n\nask  a  trial  court more  than  once  to  reconsider an  adverse\r\n\ndecision.  Discretion,  after all,  is often the  better part  of\r\n\nvalor.\r\n\n          We need  go no further.   It may be that,  in the final\r\n\nanalysis, the plaintiff cannot muster enough evidence to ward off\r\n\na  properly advertised summary judgment    but he  is entitled to\r\n\nmake the  attempt.  Since the record fails to show that Berkovitz\r\n\nhad a meaningful opportunity  to do so, the district  court's sua\r\n\nsponte entry of summary judgment cannot stand.\r\n\n          The judgment is  vacated, and the  case is remanded  to\r                    The judgment is  vacated, and the  case is remanded  to\r                                                                           \r\n\nthe district  court for further proceedings  consistent with this\r          the district  court for further proceedings  consistent with this\r                                                                           \r\n\nopinion.

Berkovitz challenges the district court's spontaneous entry of judgment in favor of the defendants Home Box Office, Inc.  (HBO) and Viacom International, Inc.  (Viacom).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Although we applaud the district court's innovative case management and its Briarean efforts to refine the issues for trial, we believe that in one crucial respect the court went awry.  Consequently, we vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. FACTUAL PREDICATE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We frame the facts in the aspect most beneficial to the party against whom the district court entered judgment, consistent with record support.  See, e.g., Quaker State Oil Refining Corp. v. Garrity Oil Co., 884 F.2d 1510, 1513 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1984, Berkovitz hit upon an idea for a cable television channel.  He dubbed this concept \"The Entertainment Network\" (or, for short, \"the TEN plan\").  The concept envisioned a round-the-clock commercial television channel highlighting lesser-known musical and comedic acts supplemented by talk shows, movies, and other staples.  The concept embodied interactive features through which the viewing audience could participate in contests and offer programming suggestions telephonically.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1985, Berkovitz offered a copy of the TEN plan to an HBO vice president, Larry Carlson, who accepted the offer.  He then sent the document (which, like all other copies of the TEN plan mentioned herein, bore the legend \"confidential\" on its cover page) to Carlson.  Approximately three months later, HBO disclaimed any interest and returned the submission (although Berkovitz intimates that HBO retained a copy).  In July 1987, Berkovitz attempted to interest Viacom in the TEN plan.  The chairman's secretary suggested that he forward a copy to Viacom.  He claims to have done so on the express condition that the submission was \"for [the chairman's] eyes only.\"   He also claims to have furnished extra copies at Viacom's request and to have met with an MTV vice-president, Lee Masters, anent the proposal.  Although Masters \"raved\" about certain aspects of the plan, the meeting came to naught.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Little daunted, Berkovitz resumed his courtship of HBO.  During the fall of 1987 he met with Carlson, who, Berkovitz maintains, perused the TEN plan, praised it, agreed to keep its contents in confidence, and led him to believe that HBO would help launch the new enterprise and share the fruits with him.  Despite these encomia, and several subsequent telephone conversations in the same vein, HBO never followed through.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HBO inaugurated \"The Comedy Channel\" in November of 1989.  Viacom shortly followed suit with \"Ha!   The Comedy Network.\"   Late in 1990 the two merged to become \"Comedy Central.\"   Berkovitz insists that these offerings all drew their inspiration from the TEN plan, and that they did so in blatant disregard of his proprietary rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. TRAVEL OF THE CASE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The procedural aspects of this litigation are of decretory significance.  We divide our account into two parts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>A. Initial Proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Invoking diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332, Berkovitz filed suit in federal district court on January 28, 1991.  Judge Skinner drew the case.  In the complaint, the plaintiff alleged that HBO and Viacom pirated his concept without compensating him, unjustly enriched themselves at his expense, breached implied-in-fact contracts to pay him if they used the TEN plan to productive ends, and committed unfair trade practices.  The defendants denied these allegations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The novelty (or lack thereof) of the TEN plan and its constituent elements soon became a protuberant bone of contention.  The defendants, positing that New York's substantive law governed, maintained that Berkovitz had to prove the novelty of his idea in order to recover under any actionable theory of the case.  Berkovitz, positing that the substantive law of Massachusetts governed, attempted to parry this thrust on two levels:  he asserted both that his idea was in fact novel, and that in all events a plaintiff whose idea was misappropriated in contravention of an implied-in-fact contract need not prove novelty in order to recover.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In time, the defendants moved for summary judgment.  Judge Skinner considered the parties' arguments and reserved decision.  In a rescript dated May 18, 1994, he held (1) that Massachusetts law supplies the rule of decision, (2) that Massachusetts does not require a showing of novelty when the plaintiff alleges the existence of a contractual relationship, and (3) that the defendants' motions for summary judgment should therefore be denied on all but the unfair trade practices claim.  The court entered an appropriate order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>B. The Pretrial Conferences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Judge Skinner elected senior status, many of his cases were redrawn.  Judge Keeton assumed responsibility for this case in mid-1994.  Although the defendants moved for reconsideration of the earlier denial of brevis disposition, Judge Keeton did not act upon these motions.  He instead convened a series of pretrial conferences in a commendable effort to bring matters to a head.  During the last four conferences (all of which took place in 1995), the judge concentrated on clarifying and delimiting the issues to be tried.  Because the events that transpired at these conferences shed considerable light on this appeal, we set out a brief chronology.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The March 21 Conference.   The first of the four conferences focused primarily on the parties' agreement to bifurcate the trial, separating the issues of liability and damages.  But Judge Keeton also seized this opportunity to instruct the parties to spell out their legal theories (avoiding forensic jargon), and directed them to develop a verdict form suitable for submission to a jury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The April 27 Conference.   At the next conference the parties wrangled over a proposed verdict form.  The debate led Judge Keeton to remark that \"we're going to have to get specific\" about what elements of the TEN plan were \"substantially used\" by the defendants.  The judge explained that this degree of particularization would assist in \"structuring the claims and defenses so that I can understand them, so the jury can understand them, [and] so that [the litigants] can understand each other.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. The June 1 Conference.   At the third conference the judge cautioned that he would not allow the jury to consider \"a fuzzy claim\" and urged the plaintiff's lawyer to \"communicat[e] to me clearly ... your legal and factual theory.\"   After some additional discourse (during which the defendants unsuccessfully sought leave to file fresh motions for summary judgment), plaintiff's counsel reformulated his position.  He pledged that he would prove (1) an implied agreement between Berkovitz and each of the defendants for confidential disclosure of the TEN plan, and (2) the defendants' appropriation of the plan in derogation of this agreement.  The court reiterated its concern that this reformulation did not enumerate which elements of the plan were novel and which were used by the defendants.  In addition, the court asked the plaintiff to list the legal elements of his implied-in-fact contract claim, and plaintiff's counsel agreed to try again.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. The July 18 Conference.   The plaintiff's outright abandonment of any cause of action based on the putative novelty of any of the elements contained in the TEN plan dominated the early stages of the final conference.  Novelty aside, the defense maintained that the plaintiff still had not specified the elements of his remaining implied contract claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The court reaffirmed its desire that Berkovitz state his cause of action with particularity.  Noting that Berkovitz's proposed jury instructions, if given, would require the jury to find that HBO and/or Viacom made \"substantial use\" of the TEN plan, the court asked Berkovitz to specify what this portended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More discussion ensued, but the judge remained dissatisfied;  he reminded Berkovitz's counsel that he had the authority to require a plaintiff to state with particularity the theory underpinning his claim, and warned that he might dismiss the case because Berkovitz had failed to comply with the particularization orders.  The defendants moved orally for summary judgment on the ground that all the elements of the TEN plan were in the public domain.  The court expressed no interest in strolling down this road, and the oral motions languished.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a last-ditch effort to satisfy the court's demands, Berkovitz's attorney again attempted to articulate his theory of the case.  The lawyer delineated what he termed Berkovitz's position \"from day one\":  Berkovitz gave the defendants copies of the TEN plan under circumstances in which a reasonable person would expect compensation if they (or either of them) used his work product.  Thus, if a defendant had made some beneficial use of some part of that document, Berkovitz would be entitled to relief.  The court described this iteration of Berkovitz's theory as postulating an \"all factors\" approach because it did not differentiate among the elements of the TEN plan (e.g., it did not single out which elements the plaintiff claimed had been misappropriated and used).  After expressing its belief that the approach probably was \"incorrect as a matter of law,\" the court entered an interlocutory judgment for the defendants but gave Berkovitz \"time for filing something more.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. The Court's Final Order.   Berkovitz--who apparently believed that the court had entered the interlocutory judgment either as a sanction for failure adequately to particularize his claim or because it found the \"all factors\" approach legally infirm--moved for reconsideration.  The court denied the motion and entered final judgment.  See Berkovitz v. HBO, 1995 WL 791939, at * 10 (D.Mass. Oct. 23, 1995).  In this order the court clarified the basis on which the judgment rested;  in its view, Berkovitz's claim lacked factual grounding.  See id. at * 5.   Consequently, the court terminated the case on substantive grounds.  See id. at * 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our analysis proceeds in three steps.  First, we examine the lower court's final order and explain why we deem that order to be a species of sua sponte summary judgment.  Next, we delineate the legal standards that pertain to such judgments.  Finally, we dispose of the appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>A. Characterizing the District Court's Final Order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no fault with the judge's decision to convene a series of pretrial conferences devoted largely to refining the issues and ascertaining which issues were fit for the jury's consumption.  Federal district courts enjoy wide discretion in their crafting of the pretrial process, see, e.g., Cleveland v. Piper Aircraft Corp., 985 F.2d 1438, 1450 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 291, 126 L.Ed.2d 240 (1993);  Jensen v. Frank, 912 F.2d 517, 524 (1st Cir.1990), and requiring parties to particularize claims or defenses falls well within the compass of that discretion.  In a related vein, courts may use case management tools to advance the important purpose of affording \"the opposing party fair notice of the claims asserted against him and the grounds on which those claims rest.\"  Rodriguez v. Doral Mortgage Corp., 57 F.3d 1168, 1171 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the court made adroit use of its powers and succeeded in winnowing the plaintiff's claims until only one claim remained--the implied contract claim premised on the \"all factors\" approach.  There are three possibilities that might explain why the court entered judgment in the defendants' favor on this last claim:  (1) the claim may have depended upon a flawed legal theory, or (2) it may have been stated too loosely (in defiance of the court's particularization orders), or (3) it may have lacked a sufficient evidentiary predicate.  Though the court criticized the \"all factors\" approach in various respects at various times, careful perscrutation of the final order rules out two of these possibilities.  As to legal insufficiency, the court stated that it had \"[a]ssum[ed], without deciding, that [the \"all factors\" approach upon which Berkovitz's implied contract claim depends] is indeed a correct interpretation of the law in Massachusetts.\"  Berkovitz, supra, at * 5. As to the particularization orders, the court vouchsafed that the plaintiff did not violate these orders by failing to furnish a more precise statement of his implied contract claim.  See id. at * 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves the third possibility:  evidentiary insufficiency.  Unlike the other possibilities, that explanation is strengthened by the language of the final order.  The court wrote \"that the plaintiff has provided no evidence from which a jury could decide ... that in this case factual circumstances supporting ... a duty [of confidentiality] arose at some point during the negotiations of the parties.\"  Id. at * 5.   Along the same lines, the court added that \"[a] jury could not reasonably find, on this evidence, that factual conditions prerequisite to a contractual or fiduciary duty existed in this case.\"  Id.  Consequently, Berkovitz's implied contract claim did not \"survive[ ] examination on the merits.\"  Id. at * 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not paint the lily.  Since \"the district court speaks to us primarily through its decrees,\" Advance Fin.  Corp. v. Isla Rica Sales, Inc., 747 F.2d 21, 26 (1st Cir.1984), the final order itself is the most likely source of enlightenment in our quest to understand its nature.  Here, the order, fairly read, discounts the other possibilities and disposes of the plaintiff's implied contract claim on a substantive ground:  lack of evidence.  Accordingly, we are constrained to characterize the court's action as a spontaneous grant of summary judgment rather than as a dismissal for either legal insufficiency or want of compliance with case management orders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>B. Elucidating the Applicable Legal Standards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is apodictic that district courts have the power to grant summary judgment sua sponte.  See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 326, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2554, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986);  Stella v. Tewksbury, 4 F.3d 53, 55 (1st Cir.1993);  Jardines Bacata, Ltd. v. Diaz-Marquez, 878 F.2d 1555, 1560 (1st Cir.1989).  Properly deployed, that power can complement the courts' case management authority.  After all, pretrial conferences aid district courts in \"the formulation and simplification of the issues, including the elimination of frivolous claims or defenses.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(c)(1).  Since this process is designed to promote efficiency and conserve judicial resources, see In re Two Appeals, 994 F.2d 956, 965 (1st Cir.1993), \"[t]here is no reason to require that [the elimination of non-trialworthy claims] await a formal motion for summary judgment.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(c)(1) advisory committee's note to 1983 amendment;  accord Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. P &amp; B Autobody, 43 F.3d 1546, 1568 (1st Cir.1994).  Thus, when \"the pretrial conference discloses that no material facts are in dispute and that the undisputed facts entitle one of the parties to judgment as a matter of law,\" Portsmouth Square, Inc. v. Shareholders Protective Comm., 770 F.2d 866, 869 (9th Cir.1985), the court may dispose of the entire case by granting summary judgment sua sponte.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  See Capuano v. United States, 955 F.2d 1427, 1432 (11th Cir.1992);  Portsmouth Square, 770 F.2d at 869.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though a district court may enter summary judgment sua sponte at, or in consequence of, a pretrial conference, the court must ensure that the targeted party has an adequate opportunity to dodge the bullet.  To this end, we have placed two conditions on unbesought summary judgments.  First, a district court ordinarily may order summary judgment on its own initiative only when discovery is sufficiently advanced that the parties have enjoyed a reasonable opportunity to glean the material facts.  See Stella, 4 F.3d at 55;  Jardines Bacata, 878 F.2d at 1561.   Second, the court may enter summary judgment sua sponte only if it first gives the targeted party appropriate notice and a chance to present its evidence on the essential elements of the claim or defense.  See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 326, 106 S.Ct. at 2554;  see also Jardines Bacata, 878 F.2d at 1561 (\" 'Notice' in this context means that the losing party ... received a fair opportunity to put its best foot forward.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These strictures are not peculiar to sua sponte summary judgments, but, rather, mirror the general principles that govern all motions for summary judgment.  See Stella, 4 F.3d at 56 (noting that \"it is well settled in this circuit that all summary judgment proceedings, including those initiated by the district judge, will be held to the standards enunciated in Rule 56 itself\");  Quaker State, 884 F.2d at 1513 (explaining that the district court's power to order summary judgment on its own initiative must be exercised \"according to the rigorous protocol of Rule 56\").  This means, of course, that a nisi prius court must give the targeted party at least ten days within which to proffer affidavits or other evidence in response to the court's specific concerns.  See Stella, 4 F.3d at 56.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellate review is equally unaffected by the spontaneous nature of the trial court's action.  As with any other grant of summary judgment, the court of appeals affords plenary review to a decision granting sua sponte summary judgment, and reads the record in the light most hospitable to the targeted party.  See Quaker State, 884 F.2d at 1513.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>C. Applying the Standards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These standards inform the disposition of this appeal.  Having scoured the record, we believe that the district court failed to give the plaintiff adequate notice of the basis for the action that the court ultimately took, and that, therefore, the judgment cannot stand.  We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a court charts a procedural route, lawyers and litigants are entitled to rely on it.  A court cannot alter its bearings mid-course without signalling the impending change to the parties.  See Foster-Miller, Inc. v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox, 46 F.3d 138, 148-49 (1st Cir.1995) (pointing out that this principle is especially pertinent \"[w]hen judges elect on their own initiative to use innovative methods in an effort to accelerate the progress of a case\");  Stella, 4 F.3d at 55-56 (applying this principle to a sua sponte summary judgment).  Here, the judge obviously understood the rule, see Berkovitz, supra, at * 2 (acknowledging the court's obligation to afford \"an opportunity for counsel opposing the judgment to proffer all relevant and admissible evidence\"), and apparently thought that he had honored it.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">at * 1 (describing the particularity-of-claim orders as requiring Berkovitz \"to proffer admissible evidence sufficient to support the findings necessary to satisfy the elements of [his] legal theory\");  id. at * 5 (stating that Berkovitz was \"given an opportunity to proffer any additional evidence that might be material\").  Yet the record simply does not bear out the court's recollection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One part of the problem relates to the particularity-of-claim orders.  The court did not reduce those orders to writing, but delivered them ora sponte at the pretrial conferences that we have chronicled.  Nonetheless, the conferences took place in the presence of a court reporter and transcripts now have been prepared.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Whatever the court's intentions, its transcribed words do not require the plaintiff to proffer evidence of the existence of the implied contracts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another part of the problem is that the district court appears to have changed course without giving the targeted party sufficient forewarning.  When the court informed the plaintiff at the penultimate (June 1) conference that it might enter an adverse judgment, it linked this possibility not to evidentiary insufficiency but to the plaintiff's failure satisfactorily to comply with the particularity-of-claim orders.  See id. at * 3. At the last conference (July 18) the court reinforced this linkage by discussing its entry of an interlocutory judgment in tandem with its comments on the plaintiff's inability to articulate avenues of legal relief beyond the \"all factors\" approach.  See, e.g., id.   In its written opinion, however, the court veered in a different direction.  It explained that the claim predicated on the \"all factors\" approach would not fly because \"the plaintiff has provided no evidence from which a jury could decide, under any plausible interpretation of Massachusetts cases, that in this case factual circumstances supporting such a duty [of confidentiality] arose at some point during the negotiations of the parties.\" Id. at * 5 (emphasis * 31. supplied).  Prior to making this ruling, the court had neither informed Berkovitz that it was considering a judgment based on evidentiary insufficiency nor invited him to marshal and present his proof in respect to the existence vel non of an implied contract.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  To the contrary, the court's pre-ruling statements pointed in the opposite direction.  We cite two examples.  At the June 1 conference plaintiff's counsel strove to embellish the elements of his client's implied contract claim.  The court interrupted him, stating:  \"I don't want to talk about the proof at this point.  I just want to talk about the legal elements....\"  The second example is drawn from the July 18 semble;  the court's declaration on this occasion that the plaintiff's claim was \"incorrect as a matter of law\" tended to render any proffer of evidence supporting that claim nugatory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question that confronts us is not whether the \"all factors\" approach is (or is not) legally sound.  Similarly, the question is not whether there is (or is not) adequate evidence in the record to defeat summary judgment on the \"all factors\" approach.  The question, rather, is whether the court gave the plaintiff a meaningful opportunity to cull the best evidence supporting his position, and to present that evidence, together with developed legal argumentation, in opposition to the entry of summary judgment.  See Stella, 4 F.3d at 55;  Bonilla v. Nazario, 843 F.2d 34, 37 (1st Cir.1988).  On this record, we think that the opportunity--if one existed--was too poorly defined.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor are we comfortable shifting the blame for the apparent miscommunication to the plaintiff.  To be sure, this court from time to time has refused to permit appellants to take advantage of supposed oversights that had not been called to the district court's attention by way of a timeous motion to reconsider.  See, e.g., United States v. Schaefer, 87 F.3d 562, 570 n. 9 (1st Cir.1996);  Grenier v. Cyanamid Plastics, Inc., 70 F.3d 667, 678 (1st Cir.1995);  VanHaaren v. State Farm Mut. Auto.  Ins. Co., 989 F.2d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir.1993).  But here, the plaintiff filed a motion to reconsider, raising all the grounds that were apparent at the time.  It was not until the district court ruled on the reconsideration motion that the spotlight suddenly swung to evidentiary insufficiency.  While the plaintiff theoretically might have filed a second motion for reconsideration at that time, the appeal period was running;  and, moreover, we are reluctant to fault a suitor who, like Berkovitz, chooses not to ask a trial court more than once to reconsider an adverse decision.  Discretion, after all, is often the better part of valor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  It may be that, in the final analysis, the plaintiff cannot muster enough evidence to ward off a properly advertised summary judgment--but he is entitled to make the attempt.  Since the record fails to show that Berkovitz had a meaningful opportunity to do so, the district court's sua sponte entry of summary judgment cannot stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

Four is, did he submit it ... to them in a context in which one can imply a promise to pay for it if they use it?  ...  And then if [the jurors] answer all of those correctly, I would say under that one theory of the case, then you go to damages....\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Following the parties' lead, we use \"implied contract\" and words of like import as a rubric to cover not only plaintiff's implied contract claim but also his embedded claim for breach of fiduciary duty.

Crowley Maritime Corp., 824 F.2d 131, 133 (1st Cir.1987)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> While the four conferences listed in our chronology were on the record, the court convened at least one other conference (November 21, 1994) for which no transcript has been supplied.

The plaintiff's motion for reconsideration makes manifest Berkovitz's belief that the court defenestrated the case either as a sanction or because the \"all factors\" approach failed as a matter of law.  By the same token, the defendants' oppositions to that motion did not attempt to justify the judgment on the ground that there were evidentiary deficiencies related to the plaintiff's proof of one or more contractual relationships</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> There are four reasons why it is not a satisfactory answer to suggest that the plaintiff had an opportunity to proffer this evidence in connection with the defendants' original Rule 56 motions.  First, the defendants forswore any reliance on the insufficiency of such evidence when they filed those motions.  Second, Judge Skinner neither focused on nor purported to decide whether the plaintiff could prove the existence of one or more implied contracts, but, rather, assumed that the defendants had entered into such contracts.  Third, the contours of the case thereafter changed dramatically, and Judge Keeton explicitly declined to rule on the defendants' pending motions to reconsider Judge Skinner's order.  See Berkovitz, supra, at * 3.   Finally, the defendants' reconsideration motions (like their original Rule 56 motions) also assumed the existence of the requisite contractual relationship</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

(Viacom).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Although we applaud the district court's innovative case management and its Briarean efforts to refine the issues for trial, we believe that in one crucial respect the court went awry.  Consequently, we vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. FACTUAL PREDICATE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We frame the facts in the aspect most beneficial to the party against whom the district court entered judgment, consistent with record support.  See, e.g., Quaker State Oil Refining Corp. v. Garrity Oil Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529278\"><a href=\"/opinion/529278/quaker-state-oil-refining-corporation-v-garrity-oil-company-inc-quaker/\"><span class=\"volume\">884</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1510</span></a></span>, 1513 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1984, Berkovitz hit upon an idea for a cable television channel.  He dubbed this concept \"The Entertainment Network\" (or, for short, \"the TEN plan\").  The concept envisioned a round-the-clock commercial television channel highlighting lesser-known musical and comedic acts supplemented by talk shows, movies, and other staples.  The concept embodied interactive features through which the viewing audience could participate in contests and offer programming suggestions telephonically.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1985, Berkovitz offered a copy of the TEN plan to an HBO vice president, Larry Carlson, who accepted the offer.  He then sent the document (which, like all other copies of the TEN plan mentioned herein, bore the legend \"confidential\" on its cover page) to Carlson.  Approximately three months later, HBO disclaimed any interest and returned the submission (although Berkovitz intimates that HBO retained a copy).  In July 1987, Berkovitz attempted to interest Viacom in the TEN plan.  The chairman's secretary suggested that he forward a copy to Viacom.  He claims to have done so on the express condition that the submission was \"for [the chairman's] eyes only.\"   He also claims to have furnished extra copies at Viacom's request and to have met with an MTV vice-president, Lee Masters, anent the proposal.  Although Masters \"raved\" about certain aspects of the plan, the meeting came to naught.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Little daunted, Berkovitz resumed his courtship of HBO.  During the fall of 1987 he met with Carlson, who, Berkovitz maintains, perused the TEN plan, praised it, agreed to keep its contents in confidence, and led him to believe that HBO would help launch the new enterprise and share the fruits with him.  Despite these encomia, and several subsequent telephone conversations in the same vein, HBO never followed through.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HBO inaugurated \"The Comedy Channel\" in November of 1989.  Viacom shortly followed suit with \"Ha!   The Comedy Network.\"   Late in 1990 the two merged to become \"Comedy Central.\"   Berkovitz insists that these offerings all drew their inspiration from the TEN plan, and that they did so in blatant disregard of his proprietary rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. TRAVEL OF THE CASE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The procedural aspects of this litigation are of decretory significance.  We divide our account into two parts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>A. Initial Proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Invoking diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332, Berkovitz filed suit in federal district court on January 28, 1991.  Judge Skinner drew the case.  In the complaint, the plaintiff alleged that HBO and Viacom pirated his concept without compensating him, unjustly enriched themselves at his expense, breached implied-in-fact contracts to pay him if they used the TEN plan to productive ends, and committed unfair trade practices.  The defendants denied these allegations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The novelty (or lack thereof) of the TEN plan and its constituent elements soon became a protuberant bone of contention.  The defendants, positing that New York's substantive law governed, maintained that Berkovitz had to prove the novelty of his idea in order to recover under any actionable theory of the case.  Berkovitz, positing that the substantive law of Massachusetts governed, attempted to parry this thrust on two levels:  he asserted both that his idea was in fact novel, and that in all events a plaintiff whose idea was misappropriated in contravention of an implied-in-fact contract need not prove novelty in order to recover.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In time, the defendants moved for summary judgment.  Judge Skinner considered the parties' arguments and reserved decision.  In a rescript dated May 18, 1994, he held (1) that Massachusetts law supplies the rule of decision, (2) that Massachusetts does not require a showing of novelty when the plaintiff alleges the existence of a contractual relationship, and (3) that the defendants' motions for summary judgment should therefore be denied on all but the unfair trade practices claim.  The court entered an appropriate order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>B. The Pretrial Conferences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Judge Skinner elected senior status, many of his cases were redrawn.  Judge Keeton assumed responsibility for this case in mid-1994.  Although the defendants moved for reconsideration of the earlier denial of brevis disposition, Judge Keeton did not act upon these motions.  He instead convened a series of pretrial conferences in a commendable effort to bring matters to a head.  During the last four conferences (all of which took place in 1995), the judge concentrated on clarifying and delimiting the issues to be tried.  Because the events that transpired at these conferences shed considerable light on this appeal, we set out a brief chronology.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The March 21 Conference.   The first of the four conferences focused primarily on the parties' agreement to bifurcate the trial, separating the issues of liability and damages.  But Judge Keeton also seized this opportunity to instruct the parties to spell out their legal theories (avoiding forensic jargon), and directed them to develop a verdict form suitable for submission to a jury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The April 27 Conference.   At the next conference the parties wrangled over a proposed verdict form.  The debate led Judge Keeton to remark that \"we're going to have to get specific\" about what elements of the TEN plan were \"substantially used\" by the defendants.  The judge explained that this degree of particularization would assist in \"structuring the claims and defenses so that I can understand them, so the jury can understand them, [and] so that [the litigants] can understand each other.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. The June 1 Conference.   At the third conference the judge cautioned that he would not allow the jury to consider \"a fuzzy claim\" and urged the plaintiff's lawyer to \"communicat[e] to me clearly ... your legal and factual theory.\"   After some additional discourse (during which the defendants unsuccessfully sought leave to file fresh motions for summary judgment), plaintiff's counsel reformulated his position.  He pledged that he would prove (1) an implied agreement between Berkovitz and each of the defendants for confidential disclosure of the TEN plan, and (2) the defendants' appropriation of the plan in derogation of this agreement.  The court reiterated its concern that this reformulation did not enumerate which elements of the plan were novel and which were used by the defendants.  In addition, the court asked the plaintiff to list the legal elements of his implied-in-fact contract claim, and plaintiff's counsel agreed to try again.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. The July 18 Conference.   The plaintiff's outright abandonment of any cause of action based on the putative novelty of any of the elements contained in the TEN plan dominated the early stages of the final conference.  Novelty aside, the defense maintained that the plaintiff still had not specified the elements of his remaining implied contract claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The court reaffirmed its desire that Berkovitz state his cause of action with particularity.  Noting that Berkovitz's proposed jury instructions, if given, would require the jury to find that HBO and/or Viacom made \"substantial use\" of the TEN plan, the court asked Berkovitz to specify what this portended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More discussion ensued, but the judge remained dissatisfied;  he reminded Berkovitz's counsel that he had the authority to require a plaintiff to state with particularity the theory underpinning his claim, and warned that he might dismiss the case because Berkovitz had failed to comply with the particularization orders.  The defendants moved orally for summary judgment on the ground that all the elements of the TEN plan were in the public domain.  The court expressed no interest in strolling down this road, and the oral motions languished.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a last-ditch effort to satisfy the court's demands, Berkovitz's attorney again attempted to articulate his theory of the case.  The lawyer delineated what he termed Berkovitz's position \"from day one\":  Berkovitz gave the defendants copies of the TEN plan under circumstances in which a reasonable person would expect compensation if they (or either of them) used his work product.  Thus, if a defendant had made some beneficial use of some part of that document, Berkovitz would be entitled to relief.  The court described this iteration of Berkovitz's theory as postulating an \"all factors\" approach because it did not differentiate among the elements of the TEN plan (e.g., it did not single out which elements the plaintiff claimed had been misappropriated and used).  After expressing its belief that the approach probably was \"incorrect as a matter of law,\" the court entered an interlocutory judgment for the defendants but gave Berkovitz \"time for filing something more.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. The Court's Final Order.   Berkovitz--who apparently believed that the court had entered the interlocutory judgment either as a sanction for failure adequately to particularize his claim or because it found the \"all factors\" approach legally infirm--moved for reconsideration.  The court denied the motion and entered final judgment.  See Berkovitz v. HBO, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">791939</span></span>, at * 10 (D.Mass. Oct. 23, 1995).  In this order the court clarified the basis on which the judgment rested;  in its view, Berkovitz's claim lacked factual grounding.  See id. at * 5.   Consequently, the court terminated the case on substantive grounds.  See id. at * 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our analysis proceeds in three steps.  First, we examine the lower court's final order and explain why we deem that order to be a species of sua sponte summary judgment.  Next, we delineate the legal standards that pertain to such judgments.  Finally, we dispose of the appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>A. Characterizing the District Court's Final Order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no fault with the judge's decision to convene a series of pretrial conferences devoted largely to refining the issues and ascertaining which issues were fit for the jury's consumption.  Federal district courts enjoy wide discretion in their crafting of the pretrial process, see, e.g., Cleveland v. Piper Aircraft Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600380\"><a href=\"/opinion/600380/edward-charles-cleveland-by-and-through-the-conservator-of-his-estate/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1438</span></a></span>, 1450 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In a related vein, courts may use case management tools to advance the important purpose of affording \"the opposing party fair notice of the claims asserted against him and the grounds on which those claims rest.\"  Rodriguez v. Doral Mortgage Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196161\"><a href=\"/opinion/196161/rodriguez-bruno-v-doral-mortgage/\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1168</span></a></span>, 1171 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the court made adroit use of its powers and succeeded in winnowing the plaintiff's claims until only one claim remained--the implied contract claim premised on the \"all factors\" approach.  There are three possibilities that might explain why the court entered judgment in the defendants' favor on this last claim:  (1) the claim may have depended upon a flawed legal theory, or (2) it may have been stated too loosely (in defiance of the court's particularization orders), or (3) it may have lacked a sufficient evidentiary predicate.  Though the court criticized the \"all factors\" approach in various respects at various times, careful perscrutation of the final order rules out two of these possibilities.  As to legal insufficiency, the court stated that it had \"[a]ssum[ed], without deciding, that [the \"all factors\" approach upon which Berkovitz's implied contract claim depends] is indeed a correct interpretation of the law in Massachusetts.\"  Berkovitz, supra, at * 5. As to the particularization orders, the court vouchsafed that the plaintiff did not violate these orders by failing to furnish a more precise statement of his implied contract claim.  See id. at * 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves the third possibility:  evidentiary insufficiency.  Unlike the other possibilities, that explanation is strengthened by the language of the final order.  The court wrote \"that the plaintiff has provided no evidence from which a jury could decide ... that in this case factual circumstances supporting ... a duty [of confidentiality] arose at some point during the negotiations of the parties.\"  Id. at * 5.   Along the same lines, the court added that \"[a] jury could not reasonably find, on this evidence, that factual conditions prerequisite to a contractual or fiduciary duty existed in this case.\"  Id.  Consequently, Berkovitz's implied contract claim did not \"survive[ ] examination on the merits.\"  Id. at * 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not paint the lily.  Since \"the district court speaks to us primarily through its decrees,\" Advance Fin.  Corp. v. Isla Rica Sales, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"443943\"><a href=\"/opinion/443943/advance-financial-corporation-v-isla-rica-sales-inc-antonio-novoa-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">747</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.1984), the final order itself is the most likely source of enlightenment in our quest to understand its nature.  Here, the order, fairly read, discounts the other possibilities and disposes of the plaintiff's implied contract claim on a substantive ground:  lack of evidence.  Accordingly, we are constrained to characterize the court's action as a spontaneous grant of summary judgment rather than as a dismissal for either legal insufficiency or want of compliance with case management orders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>B.

See Celotex Corp. v.

Properly deployed, that power can complement the courts' case management authority.  After all, pretrial conferences aid district courts in \"the formulation and simplification of the issues, including the elimination of frivolous claims or defenses.\"   Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(c)(1).

To this end, we have placed two conditions on unbesought summary judgments.  First, a district court ordinarily may order summary judgment on its own initiative only when discovery is sufficiently advanced that the parties have enjoyed a reasonable opportunity to glean the material facts.  See Stella, 4 F.3d at 55;  Jardines Bacata, 878 F.2d at 1561.   Second, the court may enter summary judgment sua sponte only if it first gives the targeted party appropriate notice and a chance to present its evidence on the essential elements of the claim or defense.  See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 326, 106 S.Ct. at 2554;  see also Jardines Bacata, 878 F.2d at 1561 (\" 'Notice' in this context means that the losing party ... received a fair opportunity to put its best foot forward.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These strictures are not peculiar to sua sponte summary judgments, but, rather, mirror the general principles that govern all motions for summary judgment.  See Stella, 4 F.3d at 56 (noting that \"it is well settled in this circuit that all summary judgment proceedings, including those initiated by the district judge, will be held to the standards enunciated in Rule 56 itself\");  Quaker State, 884 F.2d at 1513 (explaining that the district court's power to order summary judgment on its own initiative must be exercised \"according to the rigorous protocol of Rule 56\").  This means, of course, that a nisi prius court must give the targeted party at least ten days within which to proffer affidavits or other evidence in response to the court's specific concerns.  See Stella, 4 F.3d at 56.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellate review is equally unaffected by the spontaneous nature of the trial court's action.  As with any other grant of summary judgment, the court of appeals affords plenary review to a decision granting sua sponte summary judgment, and reads the record in the light most hospitable to the targeted party.  See Quaker State, 884 F.2d at 1513.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>C. Applying the Standards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These standards inform the disposition of this appeal.  Having scoured the record, we believe that the district court failed to give the plaintiff adequate notice of the basis for the action that the court ultimately took, and that, therefore, the judgment cannot stand.  We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a court charts a procedural route, lawyers and litigants are entitled to rely on it.  A court cannot alter its bearings mid-course without signalling the impending change to the parties.  See Foster-Miller, Inc. v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195899\"><a href=\"/opinion/195899/foster-miller-inc-v-babcock/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></a></span>, 148-49 (1st Cir.1995) (pointing out that this principle is especially pertinent \"[w]hen judges elect on their own initiative to use innovative methods in an effort to accelerate the progress of a case\");  Stella, 4 F.3d at 55-56 (applying this principle to a sua sponte summary judgment).  Here, the judge obviously understood the rule, see Berkovitz, supra, at * 2 (acknowledging the court's obligation to afford \"an opportunity for counsel opposing the judgment to proffer all relevant and admissible evidence\"), and apparently thought that he had honored it.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">at * 1 (describing the particularity-of-claim orders as requiring Berkovitz \"to proffer admissible evidence sufficient to support the findings necessary to satisfy the elements of [his] legal theory\");  id. at * 5 (stating that Berkovitz was \"given an opportunity to proffer any additional evidence that might be material\").  Yet the record simply does not bear out the court's recollection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One part of the problem relates to the particularity-of-claim orders.  The court did not reduce those orders to writing, but delivered them ora sponte at the pretrial conferences that we have chronicled.  Nonetheless, the conferences took place in the presence of a court reporter and transcripts now have been prepared.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Whatever the court's intentions, its transcribed words do not require the plaintiff to proffer evidence of the existence of the implied contracts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another part of the problem is that the district court appears to have changed course without giving the targeted party sufficient forewarning.  When the court informed the plaintiff at the penultimate (June 1) conference that it might enter an adverse judgment, it linked this possibility not to evidentiary insufficiency but to the plaintiff's failure satisfactorily to comply with the particularity-of-claim orders.  See id. at * 3. At the last conference (July 18) the court reinforced this linkage by discussing its entry of an interlocutory judgment in tandem with its comments on the plaintiff's inability to articulate avenues of legal relief beyond the \"all factors\" approach.  See, e.g., id.   In its written opinion, however, the court veered in a different direction.  It explained that the claim predicated on the \"all factors\" approach would not fly because \"the plaintiff has provided no evidence from which a jury could decide, under any plausible interpretation of Massachusetts cases, that in this case factual circumstances supporting such a duty [of confidentiality] arose at some point during the negotiations of the parties.\" Id. at * 5 (emphasis * 31. supplied).  Prior to making this ruling, the court had neither informed Berkovitz that it was considering a judgment based on evidentiary insufficiency nor invited him to marshal and present his proof in respect to the existence vel non of an implied contract.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  To the contrary, the court's pre-ruling statements pointed in the opposite direction.  We cite two examples.  At the June 1 conference plaintiff's counsel strove to embellish the elements of his client's implied contract claim.  The court interrupted him, stating:  \"I don't want to talk about the proof at this point.  I just want to talk about the legal elements....\"  The second example is drawn from the July 18 semble;  the court's declaration on this occasion that the plaintiff's claim was \"incorrect as a matter of law\" tended to render any proffer of evidence supporting that claim nugatory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question that confronts us is not whether the \"all factors\" approach is (or is not) legally sound.  Similarly, the question is not whether there is (or is not) adequate evidence in the record to defeat summary judgment on the \"all factors\" approach.  The question, rather, is whether the court gave the plaintiff a meaningful opportunity to cull the best evidence supporting his position, and to present that evidence, together with developed legal argumentation, in opposition to the entry of summary judgment.  See Stella, 4 F.3d at 55;  Bonilla v. Nazario, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"503773\"><a href=\"/opinion/503773/jose-r-bonilla-v-jose-a-nazario-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">843</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 37 (1st Cir.1988).  On this record, we think that the opportunity--if one existed--was too poorly defined.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor are we comfortable shifting the blame for the apparent miscommunication to the plaintiff.  To be sure, this court from time to time has refused to permit appellants to take advantage of supposed oversights that had not been called to the district court's attention by way of a timeous motion to reconsider.  See, e.g., United States v. Schaefer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196839\"><a href=\"/opinion/196839/united-states-v-schaefer/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">562</span></a></span>, 570 n. 9 (1st Cir.1996);  Grenier v.

But here, the plaintiff filed a motion to reconsider, raising all the grounds that were apparent at the time.  It was not until the district court ruled on the reconsideration motion that the spotlight suddenly swung to evidentiary insufficiency.  While the plaintiff theoretically might have filed a second motion for reconsideration at that time, the appeal period was running;  and, moreover, we are reluctant to fault a suitor who, like Berkovitz, chooses not to ask a trial court more than once to reconsider an adverse decision.  Discretion, after all, is often the better part of valor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  It may be that, in the final analysis, the plaintiff cannot muster enough evidence to ward off a properly advertised summary judgment--but he is entitled to make the attempt.

He testified during a deposition that he found both Berkovitz and the TEN plan lacking in focus;  hence, he refrained from making any commitments</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In the course of this conference, plaintiff's lead counsel made his first attempt to spell out his implied contract theory.  He suggested that there are several elements:  \"one is, did Mr. Berkovitz come up with the idea?  ...  Two, did he submit it to the defendants?   Three is, did they use it?  ...  Four is, did he submit it ... to them in a context in which one can imply a promise to pay for it if they use it?  ...  And then if [the jurors] answer all of those correctly, I would say under that one theory of the case, then you go to damages....\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Following the parties' lead, we use \"implied contract\" and words of like import as a rubric to cover not only plaintiff's implied contract claim but also his embedded claim for breach of fiduciary duty.  Both claims have a common denominator:  they require proof of an agreement or duty to hold Berkovitz's idea in confidence, and to compensate him for its unauthorized use</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> A district court also may grant partial summary judgment sua sponte, removing some (but fewer than all) of the parties' claims or defenses from the case.  See, e.g., Hubbard v. Parker, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"607935\"><a href=\"/opinion/607935/jon-hubbard-v-john-parker-in-his-capacity-as-president-of-the-school/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">529</span></a></span>, 530 (8th Cir.1993);  National Expo., Inc. v. Crowley Maritime Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"491640\"><a href=\"/opinion/491640/national-expositions-inc-v-crowley-maritime-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">824</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">131</span></a></span>, 133 (1st Cir.1987)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> While the four conferences listed in our chronology were on the record, the court convened at least one other conference (November 21, 1994) for which no transcript has been supplied.  The clerk's notes on the docket sheet regarding this conference are unilluminating</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> We note that all parties initially seem to have assumed that the trial court did not premise the sua sponte judgment on a dearth of evidence.  The plaintiff's motion for reconsideration makes manifest Berkovitz's belief that the court defenestrated the case either as a sanction or because the \"all factors\" approach failed as a matter of law.  By the same token, the defendants' oppositions to that motion did not attempt to justify the judgment on the ground that there were evidentiary deficiencies related to the plaintiff's proof of one or more contractual relationships</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> There are four reasons why it is not a satisfactory answer to suggest that the plaintiff had an opportunity to proffer this evidence in connection with the defendants' original Rule 56 motions.  First, the defendants forswore any reliance on the insufficiency of such evidence when they filed those motions.  Second, Judge Skinner neither focused on nor purported to decide whether the plaintiff could prove the existence of one or more implied contracts, but, rather, assumed that the defendants had entered into such contracts.  Third, the contours of the case thereafter changed dramatically, and Judge Keeton explicitly declined to rule on the defendants' pending motions to reconsider Judge Skinner's order.  See Berkovitz, supra, at * 3.   Finally, the defendants' reconsideration motions (like their original Rule 56 motions) also assumed the existence of the requisite contractual relationship</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
