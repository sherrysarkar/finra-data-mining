Ronald R. Lagueux, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                  Selya, Boudin and Lynch,\r\n                      Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Ronald L'Heureux on brief pro se.\r\n   Sheldon Whitehouse, Attorney General, and Elisabeth A.\r\nWallace, Special Assistant Attorney General, on Motion to Dismiss\r\nAppeal or to Summarily Affirm the Judgment Below, for appellees.\r\n\nJune 7, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  Upon careful review of the record,\r\nappellant's brief, and defendant's motion to dismiss the appeal\r\nor for summary disposition, we conclude that this appeal is\r\nfrivolous.  The dismissal was proper for the reasons stated in\r\nthe magistrate judge's Report and Recommendation dated August\r\n5, 1998, and adopted by the district court.  Plaintiff's\r\nmeritless and irrelevant appellate arguments cast no doubt on\r\nthe dismissal.\r\n          Defendant's motion for reconsideration of the default\r\norder is granted, that default order is vacated, and\r\ndefendant's motion to dismiss is treated as his brief.\r\n          Defendant's motion for summary disposition is\r\ngranted.\r\n          Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
