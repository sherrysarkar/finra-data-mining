Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                                 \r\n\n                    Before\r\n\n           Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n\n            Stahl, Circuit Judge,\r\n\nand Rosenn, Senior Circuit Judge.\r\n\n                                 \r\n\nMichael J. Sheehan, by appointment of the Court, for\r\nappellant.\r\nJean B. Weld, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\r\nPaul M. Gagnon, United States Attorney, and Arnold H. Huftalen,\r\nAssistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for appellee.\r\n\n                                 \r\n\n               August 5, 1998\r\n                                 \r\nTORRUELLA, Chief Judge.  This appeal presents some\r\nserious and disturbing issues which are both constitutional and\r\nsubstantive in nature.  Appellant was charged and convicted in a\r\njury trial in which it was alleged that he traveled in interstate\r\ncommerce for the purpose of engaging in an illegal \"sexual act\"\r\nwith minors, in violation of 18 U.S.C.  2423(b), and that he\r\nattempted to use a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for\r\nthe purpose of producing visual depictions of that conduct, in\r\nviolation of 18 U.S.C.  2251(a).  Upon his conviction, appellant\r\nwas sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 60 months.\r\nFive issues are raised on appeal, but because of our\r\ndisposition of this case, only two need be decided by us. These\r\nare: (1) whether, as applied in this case, 18 U.S.C.  2423(b)\r\nwithstands a constitutional challenge based on the contention that\r\nit attempts to punish \"mere thoughts,\" and (2) whether the district\r\ncourt committed reversible error by not giving any jury instruction\r\non the question of entrapment, notwithstanding appellant's request\r\nfor such an instruction.  We conclude that, as applied to the facts\r\nof this case, the challenged statute punishes conduct, not \"mere\r\nthoughts\" as is claimed, and thus that it passes constitutional\r\nscrutiny.  However, we reverse appellant's conviction on both\r\ncounts because we are of the view that he was entitled to have the\r\njury instructed as to the defense of entrapment, and that the trial\r\ncourt's failure to give the instruction substantially affected his\r\nrights to a fair trial.A.  The Background Facts\r\nIn May 1995 a detective in the Keene, New Hampshire\r\nPolice Department, as part of a sting operation aimed at uncovering\r\nchild exploitation, placed a classified advertisement in the\r\npersonal section of the Tri-State Swingers magazine which read as\r\nfollows:\r\nFEMALE-TROY, NH; F.F.-female, 31; Single mom,\r\ntwo girls, one boy, seeks male as partner and\r\nmentor, seeks fun, enjoys travel and\r\nphotography, FF P.O. Box 771, Troy, New\r\nHampshire, 03465.\r\n\nApproximately 104 responses were received by the detective, who in\r\nturn answered the 97 individuals who sent addresses.  Among those\r\nwas appellant, then a 55-year old resident of Brunswick, Maine, who\r\nwas employed as a service worker with the Maine Yankee Nuclear\r\nPower Plant.\r\nBecause of the nature of the issues raised we are\r\nrequired to reproduce in sordid detail the various epistolary\r\nexchanges that ensued between appellant and the detective.\r\nThis first response from appellant, which is postmarked\r\nOctober 14, 1995, stated in its relevant parts:\r\nYour ad interested me.  Being your ad is in a\r\nswingers mag -- I will assume that you would\r\nbe willing to swing.  With that, I'll describe\r\nmyself . . . .  I enjoy hunting, fishing &amp;\r\ncamping. I am looking for someone to join me\r\nin the pursuit of happiness.  If you are that\r\nperson, then maybe we should meet &amp; discuss\r\nthe situation.  I can travel or you could come\r\nhere.  Please send photo &amp; tell me about\r\nyourself.  If I interest you send phone # and\r\nI'll call you to set up a date.\r\n\nThe detective answered on October 18, 1995:\r\nI am assuming that you responded to my ad in\r\npart to be a mentor to my children and you are\r\ninterested in family fun.  I am hoping that\r\nyou think liberally about sex.  My family is\r\nvery comfortable in front of the camera . . . \r\n\nAt trial the detective testified that the use of the word \"mentor\"\r\nin the advertisement was purposeful in order to draw out only\r\npersons who were interested in \"inter-generational sexual\r\ninteraction between adults and children.\"  Appellant testified,\r\nhowever, that after looking the term \"mentor\" up in the dictionary,\r\nhe concluded that it meant \"like role model,\" that \"it was just\r\nanother gal looking for somebody to take care of her kids like they\r\ndo nowadays all over the country . . . [f]inancially, take them\r\nfishing, hunting, whatever.\"\r\nAppellant next wrote the detective a lengthy letter,\r\npostmarked October 23, 1995:\r\nI find no problem, being a mentor to your\r\nchildren &amp; yes family fun does interest me.  I\r\nhunt, fish &amp; go camping, in fact I just bought\r\na camper yesterday &amp; am getting it ready for\r\nnext weekend.  My son &amp; friend &amp; I are going\r\nup north to deer hunt . . . . I also have a\r\nhigh speed bass boat -- I fish in tournaments,\r\nI am very outdoorsie.  Also do ice fishing.  I\r\nalso have a camper on my truck, so whenever\r\nyour ready to meet me, we could meet at a\r\ncertain location &amp; be comfortable.\r\n\nYou say you hope I am liberal about sex, I am\r\nnot exactly sure of what you are referring to\r\nin this area.  So I guess I'll tell you what I\r\nthink about sex.  First off let me tell you,\r\nthat I am an easy going person, I enjoy life\r\nto the fullest.  I am not a jealous person &amp;\r\ndo not like arguing or fighting.  I do not do\r\ndrugs, only beer &amp; my smokes.  Sex to me is\r\nvery special.  Before I got married in the\r\nearly 80's I had a girlfriend &amp; we both were\r\ninto the swinging scene.  We are/were both bi,\r\nit was one of the best periods of my life -- I\r\nmet some real nice couples &amp; we had many\r\nmoments of pure enjoyment, in fact my swinging\r\nfriends were better friends than my straight\r\nfriends . . .\r\n\nThe great part was not only did we enjoy the\r\nsexual part, but we also did other non sexual\r\nthings together, cookouts, camping &amp; saunas. \r\nYes F.F. I consider myself to be ultra liberal\r\nabout sex . . . Oh yes, I forgot, I enjoy\r\ngoing to the nudist camp in your fine state --\r\nbut at present being single -- they don't\r\nallow single males . . .\r\n\nWell F.F. I've told you about me -- now its\r\nyour turn to tell me about you.  Some of my\r\nquestions I have of you are:\r\n\n1.  What is it your looking for in life if it\r\nwas with me?\r\n\n2.  What are your interests?\r\n\n3.  Are you a bisexual woman?\r\n\n4.  Tell me about your family. Oh yes -- you\r\nsaid your family is very comfortable in front\r\nof the camera -- what are you referring to?\r\n\n5.  Could you send a photo of yourself, nude\r\npreferred, but not required.  Also one of the\r\nfamily.\r\n\n6.  Do you use drugs, smoke or drink?\r\n\n7.  What kind of personality do you have?\r\n\n8.  What do you do for work?\r\n\n9.  Anything else that would be helpful in\r\ntrying to get to know what you're like. For\r\nboth our sakes, it will be much better to know\r\nall we can about each other and accept what\r\nis! . . . . Well F.F. I guess I've told you\r\nabout me, I hope in the near future, to hear\r\nabout you . . . .\r\n\nP.S.  I was looking at the map -- I think its\r\nabout 3 hrs. drive to you.  Again your\r\noptions:\r\n\n1.  You and your family can come here.\r\n\n2.  I can meet you at your place.\r\n\n3.  Anywhere in between.\r\n\nOn November 1, 1995 the detective returned this\r\ncommunication:\r\nI am glad you agree with the liberal\r\nupbringing of children, My 12-year-old son,\r\nand his 10 and 8-year-old sisters all practice\r\nnudism in our home.  They are very comfortable\r\nbeing naked in front of one another . . . What\r\nI am talking about when I speak of family fun\r\nis that all of my children freely involve\r\nthemselves in sex training sessions. Some of\r\nthese training sessions have been\r\nphotographed.  The kids love to see themselves\r\non video.  I am very interested in introducing\r\nan adult male to further my children's sexual\r\neducation and experiences.  When I was a young\r\ngirl my uncle was very kind to me and showed\r\nme the ways of love making. Let me know if you\r\nare interested . . . .\r\n\nFor the first time in this series of exchanges, the detective\r\nanswers as \"Frances\" instead of \"F.F.\"  Appellant picks up on this\r\nand other suggestions in his answer to this letter, which is also\r\npostmarked November 1, 1995:\r\nYou appear by your letters that you are trying\r\nto see if I am shocked by what you are telling\r\nme.  I can assure you, that I am not shocked,\r\nI really think you are a super person &amp; will\r\nhave less problems with your children than\r\nmost straight, prudish couples have with their\r\nkids.  It sounds like your looking for another\r\nuncle like you had, to give your children the\r\nsame experience as you had -- a loving, caring\r\nperson.\r\n\nThe way I look at all this -- as everyone is\r\nwilling to learn about sex &amp; is not forced,\r\nwhat harm is done? None as far as I am\r\nconcerned . . . .\r\n\nYou say you are very interested in introducing\r\nan adult man to further your children's sexual\r\neducation &amp; experiences. Frances I would be\r\nhonored, if you choose me to be that adult\r\nman.\r\n\nAlso Frances, as I told you, aside from the\r\nsex department -- I am looking for a family\r\ntype life, camping, fishing, hunting, sharing\r\nthe ups &amp; downs of what life has to offer\r\n. . . .\r\n\nCould you send me a picture of you &amp; the\r\nchildren? . . . I guess I am trying to get a\r\nmental picture of you &amp; the children . . . .\r\n\nThis thought just came into my mind -- you \r\nsaid the children freely involved themselves\r\nin sex training sessions, do you have sex with\r\nthem?  Have you introduced your son to orgasm? \r\nWhat are your goals -- Teaching them straight\r\nsex, or bi-sex too? . . . . I want to have a\r\nbetter understanding of what you desire of me\r\n. . . .\r\n\nApproximately two weeks later, on November 14, 1995,\r\n\"Frances\" wrote in return, again indicating that she wanted \"to\r\nexpand [her] children's education and experience.\"  \"She\" also\r\nindicated that \"she\" shared appellant's nude photograph with them,\r\nand that they were \"very excited about meeting\" him. \"Frances\"\r\nintroduces her \"children,\" \"Steve,\" age 12, \"Jenny,\" age 10, and\r\n\"Sarah,\" who is \"just about to turn 8.\"  The letter went on to say\r\nhow she participated \"during sex training with [her] children,\" and\r\nproceeded to describe the nature of these activities, and what was\r\nexpected of appellant in this respect.  The subject of the \"uncle\"\r\nwas again raised, and \"Frances\" stated, \"I hope my children can\r\ngain the same type of experience through someone like you.\"  The\r\nclincher comes at the end when \"Frances\" expresses her desire to\r\nknow appellant \"for real. Maybe you have a video camera or have\r\naccess to one, let me know.\"\r\nAppellant's answer, postmarked November 20, 1995, is\r\naddressed to \"Frances, Steve, Jenny, &amp; Sarah.\"  Appellant expresses\r\nhis understanding of \"Frances'\" request for secrecy, \"as we all\r\nknow, it is against the law to be having sex with minors\" . . . .\r\nAs to \"Frances'\" last suggestion, however, appellant states:\r\nNo I don't have a videocamera or access to\r\none, I don't know anything about them.  But\r\nwhen we get together, I'll take you out &amp; you\r\npick the one you like &amp; I'll buy it.  I always\r\nthought about getting one -- but again I don't\r\nhave a clue as to what make, model or anything\r\nabout them.  You seem to have knowledge -- So\r\nit will be your job to pick one out . . . . I\r\ndo understand when you say you want to weed\r\nout weirdos &amp; people who would want to hurt\r\nyour children . . . . I do not consider myself\r\na pervert or a child molester . . . .\r\n\nYou ask if I had any experiences &amp; my feelings\r\nwith young people.\r\n\n1.  I get along  very well with all my grand\r\nchildren, I've always been like a magnet with\r\nkids.  They seem to accept me very well.\r\n2.  No Frances I've never had an opportunity\r\nto experience family fun before.\r\n3.  The closest I came to having one was when\r\nI was around 11 or 12 . . . . [He recounts an\r\nexperience with his stepmother] . . . .\r\n\nYou asked if I am completely opposed to sexual\r\ntouching with Steve?  Frances, . . . I am bi-\r\nsexual!  If Steve is interested &amp; wants to\r\nlearn the pleasures of bisexuality I'd be more\r\nthan willing to touch, stimulate &amp; have oral\r\nsex with him . . . .\r\n\n\"Frances\" next communicated with appellant on\r\nNovember 28, 1995.  In this letter \"she\" again referred to the\r\n\"uncle [who] taught [her] about sex when [she] was very young, and\r\nwanting \"the same type of experience for [her] children.\" \r\n\"Frances\" also tells appellant that she is not interested in\r\nfinding a partner for herself \"right now\" as she is interested \"in\r\nintroducing an adult to educate [her] children.\"  \"She\" indicates\r\nthat she has been involved with their sexual education: \r\nThe kids really enjoy being in front of our\r\nvideo camera.  I would suggest you send a\r\nvideo of yourself so the children can see\r\n. . .\r\n\nP.S. I would suggest you buy any of the new\r\nand smaller camcorders.  Any model will do.\r\nLet us know which one you pick out, they are\r\nall good.\r\n\nAppellant wrote back in a letter postmarked December 1,\r\n1995.  He suggested that they meet for a \"get acquainted\" meeting\r\nat  McDonald's or Dunkin' Donuts on his way back from a trip he was\r\nmaking to Connecticut.  He wanted to know if in fact \"Frances\" was\r\na woman:\r\nI hope you understand this. Your ad in\r\nTriState you asked for a partner and mentor\r\nfor your children, now in this last letter you\r\nsay your not interested in finding yourself a\r\npartner, rather you are more interested in\r\nfinding an adult male for the children to\r\neducate them, I guess you really want an adult\r\nsex toy for kids . . . .  I want you to know\r\nthat I would be happy to be used as your toy\r\nfor the further education of your children in\r\nthe world of sex.  I've thought about you all\r\ndaily &amp; have even come up with what I think is\r\na good idea for the 1st class that the\r\nchildren and I could have -- If your\r\ninterested, tell me &amp; in the next letter, I'll\r\ngive you a graphic detail of what the class\r\nwould consist of!\r\n\nAppellant then asks \"Frances\" a series of questions about the\r\nsexual experiences of the \"children.\"  And finally:\r\nI am happy to hear you say you don't want to\r\nforce me to do anything I don't feel\r\ncomfortable with.  The only thing I don't feel\r\ncomfortable with is the buying [of] a\r\ncamcorder &amp; sending a video.  As I already\r\ntold you, I don't have a clue about them or\r\nhow to operate them . . . .\r\n\n\"Frances'\" next letter is dated December 11, 1995.  \"She\"\r\nencloses a photograph of \"herself\" and reiterates that \"she\" is\r\n\"mainly interested in finding some one who can sexually educate\r\n[\"her\"] children through having sex with them.\"  The letter then\r\nstates that:\r\nI realize that this is something not everyone\r\ncan do or feel comfortable with.  Let me know\r\nif you feel all right with this.  Maybe if you\r\nsend a letter directly to the kids telling\r\nthem about sex and what you hope to do with\r\nthem when we all meet would be good.\r\n\n\"She\" then goes on to describe the \"children's\" sex experiences up\r\nto then, and that he should decide what he should do.\r\nAppellant next sent \"all of you\" a Christmas card post\r\nmarked December 18, 1995 in which he stated that he wished he\r\n\"could have been your Christmas present laying under the tree.\r\nMaybe next year.\"\r\nOn that same date appellant also wrote a lengthy letter\r\ndirected to \"Frances,\" which responds to \"her's\" of the 11th:\r\nI do want to thank you for the picture. You\r\nare a very attractive lady, along with having\r\nvery sensual eyes, I envy your uncle that you\r\ntold me about -- He was a very lucky man. My\r\nhope is someday I may be as lucky.  Yes my\r\ndear, I know -- you're not interested in me --\r\nbut rather for the kids. I was just letting\r\nyou know how I feel.\r\n\nAppellant then goes on to explain, at length and in detail, how he\r\nwill carry about the sexual \"education\" of \"Frances'\" \"children\". \r\nHe ends by telling \"her\" that \"[t]he next letter will be for the\r\nkids -- let them open it so it can be kind of personal for them.\"\r\nTrue to his word appellant next writes \"Steve, Jenny, and\r\nSarah\" in a letter postmarked December 19, 1995, in which no words\r\nare spared describing the sexual activities that will take place\r\nwhen \"they\" \"begin having classes in the very near future -- before\r\nthey get married -- Ha, Ha.\" (underlining in the original). \r\nAppellant ends the letter by asking \"them\" for a photograph, which\r\n\"[does not] have to be nude unless you'd like to.\"\r\n\"Frances\" responded on December 22, 1995:\r\nThe kids really liked your letter and had a\r\nlot of questions about when we will all get\r\ntogether and the things you wrote about . . .\r\nIf you are still willing we would love to have\r\nyou come and meet with us . . . A motel would\r\nbe nice.  I would like to meet in Keene, New\r\nHampshire.  I will leave the planning up to\r\nyou.  The kids told me that they would love to\r\nhave oral sex with you the first time and any\r\npictures or videos that are taken will be\r\ngiven to you as a gift.\r\n\nOn December 28, 1995, appellant answered \"Frances, Steve,\r\nJenny, &amp; Sarah\" to the effect that \"[t]he fact that you all want to\r\nmeet with me, make love &amp; a beautiful film is more than I could\r\never hope for.  I promise I will do all in my power to make you all\r\nhappy, both in the sexual department &amp; also in normal life\r\nactivities, if you will let me.\"  He goes on to state that \"this\r\nwill be a new experience for me as well.\"  The rest of the letter\r\ndeals mainly with the arrangements for the meeting, which appellant\r\nsuggests take place at the Troy (N.H.) Post Office.  He proposes\r\nthat, from there, all of them travel to Keene.  Appellant ends by\r\nasking for a \"regular picture of the kids to put on [his] dresser\"\r\nnext to \"Frances'.\"\r\n\"Frances\" answered on January 3, 1996, indicating that\r\nthe \"kids\" were \"very excited about your being involved in their\r\nsexual sessions and your bringing a video camera to make a film.\r\nSince it will be our first time you may keep the film.\"  \"She\" was\r\nnot agreeable to the Troy suggestion, however, and insisted on a\r\nmotel in Keene.  As to the request for the \"children's\" photo,\r\n\"she\" also rejected the request and told appellant that he was\r\n\"free to take as many pictures as you want when we meet.\"\r\nAppellant's final letter is postmarked January 3, 1995,\r\nand again it is addressed to \"Frances, Steve, Jenny &amp; Sarah.\"  The\r\nfinal plans for the meeting are proposed, with the date of\r\nJanuary 20th and the \"Super 8 Motel\" in Keene being suggested as\r\nthe time and place to meet.  Appellant draws a map with directions\r\nas to how to get there and indicates that he will sit in his truck\r\nin the parking area until \"they\" come along side him.  Then he will\r\nget out and approach \"them.\"  He includes a photograph of his truck\r\nso \"they\" will recognize it.\r\nIn the last of this distasteful correspondence, dated\r\nJanuary 16, 1996, \"Frances\" tells appellant that everything is on\r\ncourse for the meeting but that \"our video camera is broken so I\r\nwill leave the video or pictures (your choice) up to you.\"\r\nThe line and bait cast, all that remained was the setting\r\nof the hook.\r\nOn the appointed date, appellant drove from his home in\r\nMaine to Keene, New Hampshire, arriving at about 1:00 p.m. at the\r\nparking lot of the Super 8 Motel in that town, where he parked his\r\ntruck awaiting the arrival of \"Frances\" and the \"kids.\"  Observing\r\nhis arrival, however, was the Keene detective who had commenced the\r\nevents that eventually led to this encounter.  Upon matching\r\nappellant's vehicle with the Polaroid photo that Gamache had sent\r\n\"Frances\" on January 3, which showed a pickup truck with a camper,\r\nthe detective and other accompanying police officers approached\r\nappellant, who had remained seated in the vehicle, and proceeded to\r\narrest him and to execute an anticipatory search warrant that had\r\nbeen issued against appellant and his vehicle.\r\nInside the cab were found bags of snacks and candy,\r\nseveral two-liter bottles of soda, a bottle of wine, eleven\r\nstyrofoam cups, a jar of mixed nuts, a vibrator, a Polaroid camera\r\nloaded with film, ten extra cartridges of film, nine condoms, a\r\nlubricating jelly tube, a partially used tube of jelly, and a\r\nnumber of items conflictingly described as \"small condoms\" by the\r\ndetective and as \"finger cots\" by appellant, who testified at trial\r\nthat they are used to protect injured fingers.  Several of these\r\nlatter items were also found in appellant's pockets, within a\r\nplastic bag which also contained jelly and adult condoms.\r\nWhile this incident was developing, the Brunswick, Maine\r\npolice were executing a search warrant of appellant's home, where\r\nthey found a road map with the town of Keene circled, \"Frances'\"\r\nletters to appellant, and a note on a marker board in the kitchen,\r\nwritten by appellant's roommate, telling him not to forget his\r\ncamera.  However, they found no evidence that appellant was\r\ninterested in, or had a history of, the exploitation of children or\r\nchild pornography.\r\nB.  The Constitutional Challenge to 18 U.S.C.  2423(b)\r\nSection 2423(b) provides that:\r\nA person who travels in interstate commerce,\r\nor conspires to do so . . . for the purpose of\r\nengaging in any sexual act (as defined in\r\n 2246) with a person under 18 years of age\r\nthat would be violation of chapter 109A if the\r\nsexual act occurred in the special maritime\r\nand territorial jurisdiction of the United\r\nStates shall be fined under this title,\r\nimprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.\r\n\nCount I of the indictment, which deals with this\r\nprovision, charges appellant with having traveled in interstate\r\ncommerce from Maine to New Hampshire for the purpose of engaging in\r\nan illegal sexual act with a person under the age of 18.  It is not\r\nat issue that the acts in question are within the definition of\r\nillegal \"sexual act[s]\" as defined in 18 U.S.C.  2246(2).\r\nOn the one hand, appellant alleges the invalidity of this\r\nstatute because according to him, it criminalizes \"mere thought,\" \r\nyet, on the other hand, he claims that it is \"unconstitutional in\r\nthat it criminalizes one who crosses a state border with a sinister\r\nintent, without needing to prove any other act.\"  These really are\r\ndifferent and somewhat inconsistent arguments, which we address\r\nseparately, but which in any event are unavailing to appellant.\r\nWhether it is constitutionally permissible to criminally\r\npunish \"mere thought\" may pose an interesting subject for academic\r\ndiscourse, see Steffan v. Perry, 41 F.3d 677, 713-14 (D.C. Cir.\r\n1994); LaFave &amp; Scott, Criminal Law  25, at 177-79 (1976), but, as\r\ncan be seen from our recitation of the practically undisputed facts\r\nin this appeal, that is not the way this statute is being applied\r\nto appellant.  Appellant did not abstractly contemplate crossing\r\nstate boundaries with a thought to committing a crime upon reaching\r\nhis destination.  Appellant did not merely sit in the quiet of his\r\nhouse, contemplate evil thoughts, and then flip the channels of his\r\ntelevision set, and continue blithely with other musings. \r\nAppellant is not charged, nor does this statute, as applied, punish\r\nmere voyeurism.\r\nAs the record clearly establishes, appellant, at a\r\nminimum, engaged in a series of acts long past the \"mere thinking\"\r\nstage.  See United States v. Price, 134 F.3d 340, 351 (6th Cir.\r\n1998) (\"[B]ecause of the . . . danger of convicting for mere\r\n'thoughts' . . . we require that the 'substantial step' consist of\r\n'objective acts.'\").  This series of acts includes the interchange\r\nof extensive correspondence that eventually led to the actual trip\r\nand that shows that at some point he became an active participant\r\nin the planning of this trip; the purchasing of supplies, and their\r\ntransportation in his vehicle (supplies which, it could be argued,\r\nwere designed to be used to carry out his allegedly nefarious\r\npurposes); and his actual traveling to the subject place, on the\r\nsubject date, at least arguably (if you interpret the evidence in\r\nfavor of the Government, see United States v. Loder, 23 F.3d 586,\r\n589 (1st Cir. 1994)), ready, willing and able to carry out his\r\n\"educational\" mission.  Given these circumstances, it can hardly be\r\nclaimed that punishment for \"mere thought\" is at issue.\r\n The variation of this \"thought crime\" theme to the\r\neffect that the statute is unconstitutional because \"it\r\ncriminalizes one who crosses a state border with sinister intent,\r\nwithout the need to prove any other act\" (emphasis supplied)\r\ndemonstrates an inconsistency with the argument that \"mere thought\"\r\nis being punished.  The \"other\" act language concedes that at least\r\none act took place, i.e., crossing a state line, which is something\r\nmore than \"mere thought\".  An alternate interpretation of this\r\nclaim presupposes that Congress cannot criminalize a single act. \r\nThis is a novel theory for which we can find no support.  One\r\nclearly defined act is sufficient.  In this case, the act is\r\n\"traveling in interstate commerce,\" a phrase which  supplies not\r\nonly the jurisdictional basis for the federalization of the\r\nproscribed conduct, but also the \"objective act\" that facilitates\r\nthe proof of the intent, together with the other evidence\r\nintroduced.  See Hoke v. United States, 227 U.S. 308, 323 (1923)\r\n(similar language in the Mann Act constitutional); United States v.Vang, 128 F.3d 1065, 1073 (7th Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct.\r\n1107 (1998) ( 2423(b) constitutional); United States v. Delpit, 94\r\nF.3d 1134, 1149 (8th Cir. 1996) (similar language in the Murder-\r\nfor-Hire Statute upheld); Price, 134 F.3d at 351.  On this last\r\npoint, of course, just crossing the state border is not enough: the\r\nGovernment must also prove that the crossing was made with the\r\nintent to engage in the proscribed conduct.  \r\nProof of intent naturally means proving state of mind,\r\nbut that does not mean that one is punishing \"mere thought\" any\r\nmore than that the requirement of proving mens rea in most crimes\r\nmeans that one is solely punishing \"mere thought.\"  Now,\r\nundoubtedly, establishing intent, short of a situation in which it\r\nis admitted, is difficult and usually depends on the use of\r\ncircumstantial evidence.  See id.  But as we all know,\r\ncircumstantial evidence, if it meets all the other criteria of\r\nadmissibility,  is just as appropriate as direct evidence and is\r\nentitled to be given whatever weight the jury deems it should be\r\ngiven under the circumstances within which it unfolds.  In any\r\nevent, difficulty of proof is not a valid criteria for determining\r\nthe constitutionality of the present statute.\r\nAppellant's challenge in this respect is not well taken\r\nand is rejected.\r\nC.  The Entrapment Issue\r\nAppellant fares better on his entrapment argument.\r\nA properly preserved request for an entrapment\r\ninstruction will be reviewed plenarily on appeal.  See United\r\nStates v. Rodrguez, 858 F.2d 809, 812 (1st Cir. 1988).\r\nA criminal defendant is entitled to an instruction on his\r\ntheory of defense so long as the theory is a valid one and there is\r\nevidence in the record to support it.  See id.  In making this\r\ndetermination, the district court is not allowed to weigh the\r\nevidence, make credibility determinations, or resolve conflicts in\r\nthe proof.  Rather, the court's function is to examine the evidence\r\non the record and to draw those inferences as can reasonably be\r\ndrawn therefrom, determining whether the proof, taken in the light\r\nmost favorable to the defense can plausibly support the theory of\r\nthe defense.  See id.; see also United States v. Montaez, 105 F.3d\r\n36, 39 (1st Cir. 1997).  This is not a very high standard to meet,\r\nfor in its present context, to be \"plausible\" is to be\r\n\"superficially reasonable.\"  See Webster's Third New International\r\nDictionary, at 1736 (1971).\r\nEntrapment occurs \"when the criminal design originates\r\nwith the officials of the government, and they implant in the mind\r\nof an innocent person the disposition to commit the alleged offense\r\nand induce its commission in order that they may prosecute.\"  \r\nSorrells v. United States, 287 U.S. 435, 442 (1932).  This defense\r\nhas two elements:  (1) improper Government inducement of the crime,\r\nand (2) lack of predisposition on the part of the defendant to\r\nengage in the criminal conduct.  See Montaez, 105 F.3d at 38;\r\nUnited States v. Gendron, 18 F.3d 955, 961 (1st Cir. 1994).  The\r\ndefendant carries the initial burden of producing some evidence of\r\nboth the Government's improper inducement, and the defendant's lack\r\nof predisposition to commit the alleged offense, so as to \"raise a\r\nreasonable doubt as to whether he 'was an unwavering innocent'\r\nrather than an 'unwavering criminal.'\"  United States v. Joost, 92\r\nF.3d 7, 12 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\n\"Inducement\" exists when the governmental deception or\r\ninstigation actually implants the criminal design in the\r\ndefendant's mind.  See United States v. Russell, 411 U.S. 423, 436\r\n(1973).  Inducement may include persuasion, false statements, or\r\nother governmental conduct that creates a risk of causing an\r\notherwise unwilling person to commit the crime charged.  SeeGendron, 18 F.3d at 961-62.\r\nA \"sting\" operation is not improper inducement if it\r\nmerely provides an opportunity to commit a crime, but proof of\r\nopportunity plus \"something else\" may be adequate to meet a\r\ndefendant's burden.  See Joost, 92 F.3d at 12.  Examples found\r\nsufficient by courts include threats, forceful solicitation and\r\ndogged insistence, and repeated suggestions.  See id.\r\nOnce the defendant makes a showing of inducement and lack\r\nof predisposition, the Government must prove defendant's\r\npredisposition to engage in the charged criminal activity, beyond\r\na reasonable doubt.  See United States v. Walker, 344 F.2d 795, 796\r\n(1st Cir. 1965).  Factors to be considered by the court in\r\nassessing whether the defendant was predisposed to commit the crime\r\ncharged are:  (1) the character or reputation of the defendant; (2)\r\nwhether the initial suggestion of criminal activity was made by the\r\nGovernment; (3) whether the defendant was engaged in the criminal\r\nactivity for profit; (4) whether the defendant showed reluctance to\r\ncommit the offense, which was overcome by the governmental\r\npersuasion; and (5) the nature of the inducement or persuasion\r\noffered by the Government.  See United States v. Busby, 780 F.2d\r\n804, 807 (9th Cir. 1986).\r\nTwo recent decisions -- one from the Supreme Court and\r\nthe other from this Circuit -- have delineated more precisely the\r\ncontours of the entrapment defense.  In United States v. Jacobson,\r\n503 U.S. 540 (1992), the Supreme Court held that Jacobson had been\r\nentrapped as a matter of law when government agents engaged in a\r\ncampaign of phony mailings, which involved seven or eight mailings\r\nspanning a 26-month period, that induced him to violate the federal\r\nban on child pornography by purchasing two illegal pornographic\r\nmagazines.  After reviewing the Government's persistent\r\nencouragements, which included letters from fictional lobbying\r\norganizations that claimed to promote sexual freedoms, the Supreme\r\nCourt found that Jacobson's \"ready response to these solicitations\r\ncannot be enough to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that he was\r\npredisposed, prior to the Government acts intended to create\r\npredisposition, to commit the crime.\"  Id. at 553.\r\nIn United States v. Gendron, 18 F.3d 955 (1st Cir. 1994),\r\nthen Chief Judge (now Justice) Breyer provided our \"most useful\r\ndiscussion\" of the entrapment defense post-Jacobson.  United Statesv. Acosta, 67 F.3d 334, 337 (1st Cir. 1995).  We explained that the\r\nGovernment \"sting\" in Jacobson did more than simply offer an\r\n\"ordinary opportunity\" to buy child pornography.   Rather, that\r\nsting combined an ordinary opportunity with certain \"extra\r\nelements\" so that there was a \"risk of catching in the law\r\nenforcement net not only those who might well have committed the\r\ncrime elsewhere (in the absence of the sting), but also those who\r\n(in its absence) likely would never have done so.\"  Gendron, 18\r\nF.3d at 961.  We then identified three such \"extra elements.\"  \r\nFirst, the Government's operation \"reflected a psychologically\r\n'graduated' set of responses to Jacobson's own noncriminal\r\nresponses, beginning with innocent lures and progressing to frank\r\noffers.\"  Id. at 962.  Second, the Government's solicitations\r\nappealed to alternative motives (i.e., anti-censorship motives),\r\nsee id., which suggested that the illicit conduct was \"something\r\nthe [defendant] ought to be allowed to do,\" Jacobson, 503 U.S. at\r\n553.   Third, the Government's efforts stretched out over two\r\nyears.  Id.\r\nWithout unduly repeating the details of this depressing\r\nrecord, we survey the relevant evidence.  It is undisputed that the\r\nGovernment initiated this victimless incident with its\r\nadvertisement.  Thereafter, a stream of correspondence followed\r\neven after it became apparent, from the initial letters, that\r\nappellant was on a different wavelength than the detective. \r\nAppellant was interested in having sex with the adult \"Frances.\" \r\nHis initial response was directed to \"F.F.\"/\"Frances,\" not her\r\n\"children.\"  What each understood \"mentor\" and \"family fun\" to\r\nmean, at least at the beginning, was very different, and this can\r\nbe garnered not only from reading the correspondence, but also from\r\nboth the detective's and appellant's testimony at trial.  Appellant\r\nultimately became ensnared by the detective's artifice.  The record\r\nis clear that it was the Government's insistence and artful\r\nmanipulation of appellant that finally drew him into the web\r\nskillfully spun by the detective.  To this we must add that it was\r\nappellant's contention, and he so testified, that all of his\r\ncorrespondence about sex with minors was a ruse to have sex with\r\n\"Frances,\" who was his target from the time that he answered the\r\nad.  Although this version is obviously disputed by the Government,\r\nthat is irrelevant to the question of whether it raises an issue of\r\nentrapment to be put before the jury. \r\nFurthermore, appellant had no criminal record,\r\nparticularly as to the child molestation, exploitation, or any\r\nrelated matter.  In fact, on the stand, the detective testified\r\nthat appellant did not even fit a pedophile profile and that there\r\nwas no evidence that linked him to prior sexual activities with\r\nchildren.  It was the Government that first mentioned the\r\n\"children\" as sex objects; it was the Government that first used\r\nsexually explicit language involving the \"children\"; it was the\r\nGovernment that escalated the subject of sex with children; and it\r\nwas the Government that first brought up the use of photographic\r\nequipment.  \r\nAs to the latter, the entrapment issue becomes even more\r\napparent with respect to the allegations of attempted manufacture\r\nof child pornography. Appellant's response to \"Frances'\" suggestion\r\nof using a camera reveals how far photography was from his\r\ncerebrations or fantasies when he wrote: \"No, I don't have any\r\nvideocamera or access to one, I don't know anything about them.\" \r\nThe record is redundant with the Government's relentless\r\nreiteration of the subject to a person that was patently ignorant\r\nof this activity, even to the very last moment.\r\nTurning first to \"inducement,\" we think that, in light of\r\nour analysis in Gendron, the evidence of improper inducement here\r\nwas sufficient to submit the question to the jury.  First, Gamache\r\ninitially expressed only his desire for a sexual relationship with\r\nFrances and his intent to form a non-sexual relationship with her\r\nchildren.  In addition, the agent here manufactured the aura of a\r\npersonal relationship between Gamache and the fictional \"Frances,\"\r\nand \"Frances\" disclosed her fictional illicit intentions only well\r\ninto the correspondence.  These solicitations are quite similar to\r\nthe type of \"psychologically graduated\" responses that the JacobsonCourt found objectionable.  Second, the government agent provided\r\njustifications for the illicit activity (intergenerational sex) by\r\ndescribing \"herself\" as glad that Gamache was \"liberal\" like her,\r\nexpressing that she, as the mother of the children, strongly\r\napproved of the illegal activity, and explaining that she had\r\nengaged in this conduct as a child and found it beneficial to her. \r\nThese solicitations suggested that Gamache ought to be allowed to\r\nengage in the illicit activity, just as the Government in Jacobsonused a fake lobbying organization to appeal to anti-censorship\r\nmotives.  Finally, the Government's sting commenced in May 1995 and\r\ndid not result in any illegal conduct until January 1996.  Thus,\r\nthe Government persevered for almost seven months to elicit the\r\noffense conduct.  In Gendron, we observed that, in Jacobson, the\r\nGovernment had conceded that its methods amounted to an \"improper\r\ninducement\" as a matter of law.  Gendron, 18 F.3d at 963 (citing\r\nJacobson, 503 U.S. at 549 n.2).  We think that these \"extra\r\nelements\" are sufficient to satisfy the defendant's burden on the\r\ninducement prong.  See id. at 961. \r\nTurning to the predisposition prong, under the analysis\r\nset forth in Jacobson, a reasonable jury could find that Gamache\r\nwas not predisposed to commit the offense. \"[P]roof that [the\r\ndefendant] engaged in legal conduct and possessed certain\r\ngeneralized personal inclinations is not sufficient evidence to\r\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt that he would have been predisposed\r\nto commit the crime charged independent of the Government's\r\ncoaxing.\"  Jacobson, 503 U.S. at 551 n.3.  As we explained in\r\nGendron:\r\nThe evidence of predisposition [in\r\nJacobson] consisted of two facts: (1) that\r\nbefore the government became involved\r\nJacobson was on a private bookstore\r\nmailing list for dubious photos; and (2)\r\nthat he responded affirmatively to the\r\ngovernment's solicitations.  The first\r\nfact . . . showed little about a\r\npredisposition to act unlawfully because\r\nordering the photos was lawful at the\r\ntime. . . .  The second, placing orders,\r\ncould not show how Jacobson would have\r\nacted had the solicitation lacked . . .\r\nthe improper appeals to anti-censorship\r\nmotives, the graduated response, and the\r\nlengthy time frame.  [As a result,] the\r\ngovernment's evidence did not show how\r\nJacobson would have acted had he been\r\nfaced with an ordinary \"opportunity\" to\r\ncommit the crime rather than a special\r\n\"inducement.\" \r\nGendron, 18 F.3d at 963.  As in Jacobson, Gamache initially\r\nexpressed an interest in unusual sexual activities, but these\r\nactivities were not illegal with Frances.  Nor is the inference\r\npermissible that the tendency to engage in unusual, albeit legal,\r\nsexual activity with an adult indicates a predisposition towards\r\npedophilia.\r\nThe Government responds that Gamache's enthusiastic\r\nresponse, as expressed in the correspondence, in conjunction with\r\nthe lack of coercion and/or affirmative pressure by the Government\r\nagent, is enough to take the entrapment defense away from the jury. \r\nWe disagree.  Gamache's stated willingness to commit the crime,\r\nalthough clearly relevant to the jury's inquiry, is not sufficient\r\nby itself to mandate a finding that he was predisposed.   As Judge\r\nPosner explained: \r\nHad the Court in Jacobson believed that\r\nthe legal concept of predisposition is\r\nexhausted in the demonstrated willingness\r\nof the defendant to commit the crime\r\nwithout threats or promises by the\r\ngovernment, then Jacobson was predisposed,\r\nin which event the Court's reversal of his\r\nconviction would be difficult to explain. \r\nThe government did not offer Jacobson any\r\ninducements to buy pornographic magazines\r\nor threaten him with harm if he failed to\r\nbuy them.  It was not as if the government\r\nhad had to badger Jacobson for 26 months\r\nin order to overcome his resistance to\r\ncommitting a crime.  He never resisted.\r\nUnited States v.  Hollingsworth, 27 F.2d 1196, 1199 (7th Cir.\r\n1994).    \r\nFurthermore, as we have noted, there was no evidence\r\npresented that Gamache had engaged in similar activities\r\nindependent of this sting operation.   The jury could have relied\r\non this evidence to find a lack of predisposition because the\r\nconcept of predisposition has a definite temporal reference: \"the\r\ninquiry must focus on a defendant's predisposition before contact\r\nwith government officers or agents.\"  United States v. Brown, 43\r\nF.3d 618, 627 (11th Cir. 1995) (citing Jacobson, 503 U.S. at 547\r\nn.2); see also United States v. Gifford, 17 F.3d 462, 469 (1st Cir.\r\n1994) (identifying as \"critical\" the time \"in advance of the\r\ngovernment's initial intervention\").  All of the Government's\r\ncircumstantial evidence bearing on Gamache's intent when he crossed\r\nthe state line resulted from the Government's initial contact.  The\r\nargument is clear in regard to his conviction for attempting to use\r\na minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of\r\nproducing visual depictions.  Despite the Government's dogged\r\ninsistence that Gamache bring a video camera, Gamache professed\r\nignorance about such cameras and resisted purchasing one.  There is\r\nno evidence independent of Gamache's correspondence with the\r\ngovernment agents -- other than perhaps \"small condoms\" found on\r\nthe defendant (which the defendant testified were \"finger cots\"\r\nthat protected injuries to his fingers) -- that indicated a\r\npredisposition to engage in illegal sexual contact with minors\r\nprior to, and apart from, the correspondence.  And while \"ready\r\ncommission of the criminal act can itself adequately evince an\r\nindividual's predisposition\" and thus provide sufficient evidence\r\nto support a jury's finding that the defendant was predisposed to\r\ncommit the offense, Gifford, 17 F.3d at 469, eagerness alone, when\r\ncoupled with the \"extra elements\" present in this sting operation,\r\nis not sufficient to remove the predisposition question from the\r\njury's purview.  \r\nWe conclude that appellant met the dual burdens required\r\nfor an instruction on entrapment, because the evidence raises a\r\nreasonable doubt that the Government improperly induced a citizen\r\nto commit crimes that he was not predisposed to commit, yet crimes\r\nfor which he was charged and convicted. \"[E]ven where there are no\r\ncredibility issues or tensions in the evidence -- and some do exist\r\nhere -- entrapment is treated as an issue of fact for a jury.\" \r\nAcosta, 67 F.3d at 338.  Although it is not dispositive of the\r\nissues before us, we take note of the fact that in sentencing\r\nappellant the district judge granted a downward departure from the\r\nGuidelines, based on his conclusion that appellant had engaged in\r\n\"aberrant behavior,\" a conclusion that would seems to include some\r\nelement of lack of predisposition.\r\nThe district court committed reversible error in not\r\ngiving an instruction on the issue of entrapment.  Appellant's\r\nconviction is reversed and a new trial is ordered.\n",

Appellant was charged and convicted in a jury trial in which it was alleged that he traveled in interstate commerce for the purpose of engaging in an illegal \"sexual act\" with minors, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2423(b), and that he attempted to use a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing visual depictions of that conduct, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2251(a).

These are:  (1) whether, as applied in this case, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2423(b) withstands a constitutional challenge based on the contention that it attempts to punish \"mere thoughts,\" and (2) whether the district court committed reversible error by not giving any jury instruction on the question of entrapment, notwithstanding appellant's request for such an instruction.  We conclude that, as applied to the facts of this case, the challenged statute punishes conduct, not \"mere thoughts\" as is claimed, and thus that it passes constitutional scrutiny.  However, we reverse appellant's conviction on both counts because we are of the view that he was entitled to have the jury instructed as to the defense of entrapment, and that the trial court's failure to give the instruction substantially affected his rights to a fair trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.

I also have a camper on my truck, so whenever your ready to meet me, we could meet at a certain location &amp; be comfortable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>You say you hope I am liberal about sex, I am not exactly sure of what you are referring to in this area.  So I guess I'll tell you what I think about sex.  First off let me tell you, that I am an easy going person, I enjoy life to the fullest.  I am not a jealous person &amp; do not like arguing or fighting.  I do not do drugs, only beer &amp; my smokes.  Sex to me is very special.  Before I got married in the early 80's I had a girlfriend &amp; we both were into the swinging scene.  We are/were both bi, it was one of the best periods of my life--I met some real nice couples &amp; we had many moments of pure enjoyment, in fact my swinging friends were better friends than my straight friends ...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>The great part was not only did we enjoy the sexual part, but we also did other non sexual things together, cookouts, camping &amp; saunas.  Yes F.F. I consider myself to be ultra liberal about sex ... Oh yes, I forgot, I enjoy going to the nudist camp in your fine state--but at present being single--they don't allow single males ...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>Well F.F. I've told you about me--now its your turn to tell me about you.  Some of my questions I have of you are:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>1.  What is it your looking for in life if it was with me?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>2. What are your interests?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>3. Are you a bisexual woman?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>4. Tell me about your family.  Oh yes--you said your family is very comfortable in front of the camera--what are you referring to?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>5. Could you send a photo of yourself, nude preferred, but not required.  Also one of the family.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>6. Do you use drugs, smoke or drink?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>7. What kind of personality do you have?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>8. What do you do for work?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>9. Anything else that would be helpful in trying to get to know what you're like.  For both our sakes, it will be much better to know all we can about each other and accept what is!....   Well F.F. I guess I've told you about me, I hope in the near future, to hear about you....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>P.S. I was looking at the map--I think its about 3 hrs. drive to you.  Again your options:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>1.  You and your family can come here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>2. I can meet you at your place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>3. Anywhere in between.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 1, 1995 the detective returned this communication:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>I am glad you agree with the liberal upbringing of children, My 12-year-old son, and his 10 and 8-year-old sisters all practice nudism in our home.  They are very comfortable being naked in front of one another ... What I am talking about when I speak of family fun is that all of my children freely involve themselves in sex training sessions.  Some of these training sessions have been photographed.  The kids love to see themselves on video.  I am very interested in introducing an adult male to further my children's sexual education and experiences.  When I was a young girl my uncle was very kind to me and showed me the ways of love making.  Let me know if you are interested....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the first time in this series of exchanges, the detective answers as \"Frances\" instead of \"F.F.\" Appellant picks up on this and other suggestions in his answer to this letter, which is also postmarked November 1, 1995:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>You appear by your letters that you are trying to see if I am shocked by what you are telling me.  I can assure you, that I am not shocked, I really think you are a super person &amp; will have less problems with your children than most straight, prudish couples have with their kids.  It sounds like your looking for another uncle like you had, to give your children the same experience as you had--a loving, caring person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The way I look at all this--as everyone is willing to learn about sex &amp; is not forced, what harm is done?   None as far as I am concerned....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>You say you are very interested in introducing an adult man to further your children's sexual education &amp; experiences.  Frances I would be honored, if you choose me to be that adult man.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>Also Frances, as I told you, aside from the sex department--I am looking for a family type life, camping, fishing, hunting, sharing the ups &amp; downs of what life has to offer....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>Could you send me a picture of you &amp; the children?  ...  I guess I am trying to get a mental picture of you &amp; the children....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>This thought just came into my mind--you said the children freely involved themselves in sex training sessions, do you have sex with them?   Have you introduced your son to orgasm?   What are your goals--Teaching them straight sex, or bi-sex too?....   I want to have a better understanding of what you desire of me....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately two weeks later, on November 14, 1995, \"Frances\" wrote in return, again indicating that she wanted \"to expand [her] children's education and experience.\"  \"She\" also indicated that \"she\" shared appellant's nude photograph with them, and that they were \"very excited about meeting\" him.  \"Frances\" introduces her \"children,\" \"Steve,\" age 12, \"Jenny,\" age 10, and \"Sarah,\" who is \"just about to turn 8.\" The letter went on to say how she participated \"during sex training with [her] children,\" and proceeded to describe the nature of these activities, and what was expected of appellant in this respect.  The subject of the \"uncle\" was again raised, and \"Frances\" stated, \"I hope my children can gain the same type of experience through someone like you.\"   The clincher comes at the end when \"Frances\" expresses her desire to know appellant \"for real.  Maybe you have a video camera or have access to one, let me know.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's answer, postmarked November 20, 1995, is addressed to \"Frances, Steve, Jenny, &amp; Sarah.\"   Appellant expresses his understanding of \"Frances' \" request for secrecy, \"as we all know, it is against the law to be having sex with minors\"....   As to \"Frances' \" last suggestion, however, appellant states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>No I don't have a videocamera or access to one, I don't know anything about them.  But when we get together, I'll take you out &amp; you pick the one you like &amp; I'll buy it.  I always thought about getting one--but again I don't have a clue as to what make, model or anything about them.  You seem to have knowledge--So it will be your job to pick one out....  I do understand when you say you want to weed out weirdos &amp; people who would want to hurt your children....  I do not consider myself a pervert or a child molester....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p>You ask if I had any experiences &amp; my feelings with young people.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p>1. I get along very well with all my grand children, I've always been like a magnet with kids.  They seem to accept me very well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p>2. No Frances I've never had an opportunity to experience family fun before.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p>3. The closest I came to having one was when I was around 11 or 12....  [He recounts an experience with his stepmother]....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p>You asked if I am completely opposed to sexual touching with Steve?   Frances, ... I am bi-sexual!   If Steve is interested &amp; wants to learn the pleasures of bisexuality I'd be more than willing to touch, stimulate &amp; have oral sex with him....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Frances\" next communicated with appellant on November 28, 1995.  In this letter \"she\" again referred to the \"uncle [who] taught [her] about sex when [she] was very young, and wanting \"the same type of experience for [her] children.\"  \"Frances\" also tells appellant that she is not interested in finding a partner for herself \"right now\" as she is interested \"in introducing an adult to educate [her] children.\"  \"She\" indicates that she has been involved with their sexual education:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p>The kids really enjoy being in front of our video camera.  I would suggest you send a video of yourself so the children can see ...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p>P.S. I would suggest you buy any of the new and smaller camcorders.  Any model will do.  Let us know which one you pick out, they are all good.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant wrote back in a letter postmarked December 1, 1995.  He suggested that they meet for a \"get acquainted\" meeting at McDonald's or Dunkin' Donuts on his way back from a trip he was making to Connecticut.  He wanted to know if in fact \"Frances\" was a woman:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p>I hope you understand this.  Your ad in TriState you asked for a partner and mentor for your children, now in this last letter you say your not interested in finding yourself a partner, rather you are more interested in finding an adult male for the children to educate them, I guess you really want an adult sex toy for kids....  I want you to know that I would be happy to be used as your toy for the further education of your children in the world of sex.  I've thought about you all daily &amp; have even come up with what I think is a good idea for the 1st class that the children and I could have--If your interested, tell me &amp; in the next letter, I'll give you a graphic detail of what the class would consist of!</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant then asks \"Frances\" a series of questions about the sexual experiences of the \"children.\"   And finally:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p>I am happy to hear you say you don't want to force me to do anything I don't feel comfortable with.  The only thing I don't feel comfortable with is the buying [of] a camcorder &amp; sending a video.  As I already told you, I don't have a clue about them or how to operate them....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Frances' \" next letter is dated December 11, 1995.  \"She\" encloses a photograph of \"herself\" and reiterates that \"she\" is \"mainly interested in finding some one who can sexually educate [\"her\"] children through having sex with them.\"   The letter then states that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p>I realize that this is something not everyone can do or feel comfortable with.  Let me know if you feel all right with this.  Maybe if you send a letter directly to the kids telling them about sex and what you hope to do with them when we all meet would be good.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"She\" then goes on to describe the \"children's\" sex experiences up to then, and that he should decide what he should do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p>Appellant next sent \"all of you\" a Christmas card post marked December 18, 1995 in which he stated that he wished he \"could have been your Christmas present laying under the tree.  Maybe next year.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On that same date appellant also wrote a lengthy letter directed to \"Frances,\" which responds to \"her's\" of the 11th:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p>I do want to thank you for the picture.  You are a very attractive lady, along with having very sensual eyes, I envy your uncle that you told me about--He was a very lucky man.  My hope is someday I may be as lucky.  Yes my dear, I know--you're not interested in me--but rather for the kids.  I was just letting you know how I feel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant then goes on to explain, at length and in detail, how he will carry about the sexual \"education\" of \"Frances' \" \"children\".  He ends by telling \"her\" that \"[t]he next letter will be for the kids--let them open it so it can be kind of personal for them.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">True to his word appellant next writes \"Steve, Jenny, and Sarah\" in a letter postmarked December 19, 1995, in which no words are spared describing the sexual activities that will take place when \"they\" \"begin having classes in the very near future--before they get married--Ha, Ha.\"  (underlining in the original).  Appellant ends the letter by asking \"them\" for a photograph, which \"[does not] have to be nude unless you'd like to.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Frances\" responded on December 22, 1995:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p>The kids really liked your letter and had a lot of questions about when we will all get together and the things you wrote about ... If you are still willing we would love to have you come and meet with us ... A motel would be nice.  I would like to meet in Keene, New Hampshire.  I will leave the planning up to you.  The kids told me that they would love to have oral sex with you the first time and any pictures or videos that are taken will be given to you as a gift.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 28, 1995, appellant answered \"Frances, Steve, Jenny, &amp; Sarah\" to the effect that \"[t]he fact that you all want to meet with me, make love &amp; a beautiful film is more than I could ever hope for.  I promise I will do all in my power to make you all happy, both in the sexual department &amp; also in normal life activities, if you will let me.\"   He goes on to state that \"this will be a new experience for me as well.\"   The rest of the letter deals mainly with the arrangements for the meeting, which appellant suggests take place at the Troy (N.H.) Post Office.  He proposes that, from there, all of them travel to Keene.  Appellant ends by asking for a \"regular picture of the kids to put on [his] dresser\" next to \"Frances'.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Frances\" answered on January 3, 1996, indicating that the \"kids\" were \"very excited about your being involved in their sexual sessions and your bringing a video camera to make a film.  Since it will be our first time you may keep the film.\"  \"She\" was not agreeable to the Troy suggestion, however, and insisted on a motel in Keene.  As to the request for the \"children's\" photo, \"she\" also rejected the request and told appellant that he was \"free to take as many pictures as you want when we meet.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's final letter is postmarked January 3, 1995, and again it is addressed to \"Frances, Steve, Jenny &amp; Sarah.\"   The final plans for the meeting are proposed, with the date of January 20th and the \"Super 8 Motel\" in Keene being suggested as the time and place to meet.  Appellant draws a map with directions as to how to get there and indicates that he will sit in his truck in the parking area until \"they\" come along side him.  Then he will get out and approach \"them.\"   He includes a photograph of his truck so \"they\" will recognize it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the last of this distasteful correspondence, dated January 16, 1996, \"Frances\" tells appellant that everything is on course for the meeting but that \"our video camera is broken so I will leave the video or pictures (your choice) up to you.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The line and bait cast, all that remained was the setting of the hook.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the appointed date, appellant drove from his home in Maine to Keene, New Hampshire, arriving at about 1:00 p.m. at the parking lot of the Super 8 Motel in that town, where he parked his truck awaiting the arrival of \"Frances\" and the \"kids.\"   Observing his arrival, however, was the Keene detective who had commenced the events that eventually led to this encounter.  Upon matching appellant's vehicle with the Polaroid photo that Gamache had sent \"Frances\" on January 3, which showed a pickup truck with a camper, the detective and other accompanying police officers approached appellant, who had remained seated in the vehicle, and proceeded to arrest him and to execute an anticipatory search warrant that had been issued against appellant and his vehicle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Inside the cab were found bags of snacks and candy, several two-liter bottles of soda, a bottle of wine, eleven styrofoam cups, a jar of mixed nuts, a vibrator, a Polaroid camera loaded with film, ten extra cartridges of film, nine condoms, a lubricating jelly tube, a partially used tube of jelly, and a number of items conflictingly described as \"small condoms\" by the detective and as \"finger cots\" by appellant, who testified at trial that they are used to protect injured fingers.  Several of these latter items were also found in appellant's pockets, within a plastic bag which also contained jelly and adult condoms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While this incident was developing, the Brunswick, Maine police were executing a search warrant of appellant's home, where they found a road map with the town of Keene circled, \"Frances' \" letters to appellant, and a note on a marker board in the kitchen, written by appellant's roommate, telling him not to forget his camera.  However, they found no evidence that appellant was interested in, or had a history of, the exploitation of children or child pornography.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p>B. The Constitutional Challenge to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2423(b)</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Section 2423(b) provides that:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p>A person who travels in interstate commerce, or conspires to do so ... for the purpose of engaging in any sexual act (as defined in &#167; 2246) with a person under 18 years of age that would be violation of chapter 109A if the sexual act occurred in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Count I of the indictment, which deals with this provision, charges appellant with having traveled in interstate commerce from Maine to New Hampshire for the purpose of engaging in an illegal sexual act with a person under the age of 18.  It is not at issue that the acts in question are within the definition of illegal \"sexual act[s]\" as defined in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2246(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the one hand, appellant alleges the invalidity of this statute because according to him, it criminalizes \"mere thought,\" yet, on the other hand, he claims that it is \"unconstitutional in that it criminalizes one who crosses a state border with a sinister intent, without needing to prove any other act.\"   These really are different and somewhat inconsistent arguments, which we address separately, but which in any event are unavailing to appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether it is constitutionally permissible to criminally punish \"mere thought\" may pose an interesting subject for academic discourse, see Steffan v. Perry, 41 F.3d 677, 713-14 (D.C.Cir.1994);  LaFave &amp; Scott, Criminal Law &#167; 25, at 177-79 (1976), but, as can be seen from our recitation of the practically undisputed facts in this appeal, that is not the way this statute is being applied to appellant.  Appellant did not abstractly contemplate crossing state boundaries with a thought to committing a crime upon reaching his destination.  Appellant did not merely sit in the quiet of his house, contemplate evil thoughts, and then flip the channels of his television set, and continue blithely with other musings.  Appellant is not charged, nor does this statute, as applied, punish mere voyeurism.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the record clearly establishes, appellant, at a minimum, engaged in a series of acts long past the \"mere thinking\" stage.  See United States v. Price, 134 F.3d 340, 351 (6th Cir.1998) (\"[B]ecause of the ... danger of convicting for mere 'thoughts' ... we require that the 'substantial step' consist of 'objective acts.' \").  This series of acts includes the interchange of extensive correspondence that eventually led to the actual trip and that shows that at some point he became an active participant in the planning of this trip;  the purchasing of supplies, and their transportation in his vehicle (supplies which, it could be argued, were designed to be used to carry out his allegedly nefarious purposes);  and his actual traveling to the subject place, on the subject date, at least arguably (if you interpret the evidence in favor of the Government, see United States v. Loder, 23 F.3d 586, 589 (1st Cir.1994)), ready, willing and able to carry out his \"educational\" mission.  Given these circumstances, it can hardly be claimed that punishment for \"mere thought\" is at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The variation of this \"thought crime\" theme to the effect that the statute is unconstitutional because \"it criminalizes one who crosses a state border with sinister intent, without the need to prove any other act\" (emphasis supplied) demonstrates an inconsistency with the argument that \"mere thought\" is being punished.  The \"other\" act language concedes that at least one act took place, i.e., crossing a state line, which is something more than \"mere thought\".  An alternate interpretation of this claim presupposes that Congress cannot criminalize a single act.  This is a novel theory for which we can find no support.  One clearly defined act is sufficient.  In this case, the act is \"traveling in interstate commerce,\" a phrase which supplies not only the jurisdictional basis for the federalization of the proscribed conduct, but also the \"objective act\" that facilitates the proof of the intent, together with the other evidence introduced.  See Hoke v. United States, 227 U.S. 308, 323, 33 S.Ct. 281, 57 L.Ed. 523 (1913) (similar language in the Mann Act constitutional);  United States v. Vang, 128 F.3d 1065, 1073 (7th Cir.1997), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 118 S.Ct. 1107, 140 L.Ed.2d 160 (1998) (&#167; 2423(b) constitutional);  United States v. Delpit, 94 F.3d 1134, 1149 (8th Cir.1996) (similar language in the Murder-for-Hire Statute upheld);  Price, 134 F.3d at 351.   On this last point, of course, just crossing the state border is not enough:  the Government must also prove that the crossing was made with the intent to engage in the proscribed conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Proof of intent naturally means proving state of mind, but that does not mean that one is punishing \"mere thought\" any more than that the requirement of proving mens rea in most crimes means that one is solely punishing \"mere thought.\"   Now, undoubtedly, establishing intent, short of a situation in which it is admitted, is difficult and usually depends on the use of circumstantial evidence.  See id.   But as we all know, circumstantial evidence, if it meets all the other criteria of admissibility, is just as appropriate as direct evidence and is entitled to be given whatever weight the jury deems it should be given under the circumstances within which it unfolds.

See id.   In making this determination, the district court is not allowed to weigh the evidence, make credibility determinations, or resolve conflicts in the proof.  Rather, the court's function is to examine the evidence on the record and to draw those inferences as can reasonably be drawn therefrom, determining whether the proof, taken in the light most favorable to the defense can plausibly support the theory of the defense.  See id.;   see also United States v. Montanez, 105 F.3d 36, 39 (1st Cir.1997).  This is not a very high standard to meet, for in its present context, to be \"plausible\" is to be \"superficially reasonable.\"   See Webster's Third New International Dictionary, at 1736 (1971).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Entrapment occurs \"when the criminal design originates with the officials of the government, and they implant in the mind of an innocent person the disposition to commit the alleged offense and induce its commission in order that they may prosecute.\"  Sorrells v. United States, 287 U.S. 435, 442, 53 S.Ct. 210, 77 L.Ed. 413 (1932).  This defense has two elements:  (1) improper Government inducement of the crime, and (2) lack of predisposition on the part of the defendant to engage in the criminal conduct.  See Montanez, 105 F.3d at 38;  United States v. Gendron, 18 F.3d 955, 961 (1st Cir.1994).  The defendant carries the initial burden of producing some evidence of both the Government's improper inducement, and the defendant's lack of predisposition to commit the alleged offense, so as to \"raise a reasonable doubt as to whether he 'was an unwavering innocent' rather than an 'unwavering criminal.' \"  United States v. Joost, 92 F.3d 7, 12 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Inducement\" exists when the governmental deception or instigation actually implants the criminal design in the defendant's mind.  See United States v. Russell, 411 U.S. 423, 436, 93 S.Ct. 1637, 36 L.Ed.2d 366 (1973).  Inducement may include persuasion, false statements, or other governmental conduct that creates a risk of causing an otherwise unwilling person to commit the crime charged.

See Waker v. United States, 344 F.2d 795, 796 (1st Cir.1965).  Factors to be considered by the court in assessing whether the defendant was predisposed to commit the crime charged are:  (1) the character or reputation of the defendant;  (2) whether the initial suggestion of criminal activity was made by the Government;  (3) whether the defendant was engaged in the criminal activity for profit;  (4) whether the defendant showed reluctance to commit the offense, which was overcome by the governmental persuasion; and (5) the nature of the inducement or persuasion offered by the Government.

In Jacobson v. United States, 503 U.S. 540, 112 S.Ct. 1535, 118 L.Ed.2d 174 (1992), the Supreme Court held that Jacobson had been entrapped as a matter of law when government agents engaged in a campaign of phony mailings, which involved seven or eight mailings spanning a 26-month period, that induced him to violate the federal ban on child pornography by purchasing two illegal pornographic magazines.  After reviewing the Government's persistent encouragements, which included letters from fictional lobbying organizations that claimed to promote sexual freedoms, the Supreme Court found that Jacobson's \"ready response to these solicitations cannot be enough to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that he was predisposed, prior to the Government acts intended to create predisposition, to commit the crime.\"  Id. at 553, 112 S.Ct. 1535.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Gendron, 18 F.3d 955 (1st Cir.1994), then Chief Judge (now Justice) Breyer provided our \"most useful discussion\" of the entrapment defense post-Jacobson.  United States v. Acosta, 67 F.3d 334, 337 (1st Cir.1995).  We explained that the Government \"sting\" in Jacobson did more than simply offer an \"ordinary opportunity\" to buy child pornography.  Rather, that sting combined an ordinary opportunity with certain \"extra elements\" so that there was a \"risk of catching in the law enforcement net not only those who might well have committed the crime elsewhere (in the absence of the sting), but also those who (in its absence) likely would never have done so.\"  Gendron, 18 F.3d at 961.   We then identified three such \"extra elements.\"   First, the Government's operation \"reflected a psychologically 'graduated' set of responses to Jacobson's own noncriminal responses, beginning with innocent lures and progressing to frank offers.\"  Id. at 962.   Second, the Government's solicitations appealed to alternative motives (i.e., anti-censorship motives), see id., which suggested that the illicit conduct was \"something the [defendant] ought to be allowed to do,\" Jacobson, 503 U.S. at 553, 112 S.Ct. 1535.   Third, the Government's efforts stretched out over two years.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without unduly repeating the details of this depressing record, we survey the relevant evidence.  It is undisputed that the Government initiated this victimless incident with its advertisement.  Thereafter, a stream of correspondence followed even after it became apparent, from the initial letters, that appellant was on a different wavelength than the detective.  Appellant was interested in having sex with the adult \"Frances.\"   His initial response was directed to \"F.F.\"/\"Frances,\" not her \"children.\"   What each understood \"mentor\" and \"family fun\" to mean, at least at the beginning, was very different, and this can be garnered not only from reading the correspondence, but also from both the detective's and appellant's testimony at trial.  Appellant ultimately became ensnared by the detective's artifice.  The record is clear that it was the Government's insistence and artful manipulation of appellant that finally drew him into the web skillfully spun by the detective.  To this we must add that it was appellant's contention, and he so testified, that all of his correspondence about sex with minors was a ruse to have sex with \"Frances,\" who was his target from the time that he answered the ad.  Although this version is obviously disputed by the Government, that is irrelevant to the question of whether it raises an issue of entrapment to be put before the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, appellant had no criminal record, particularly as to the child molestation, exploitation, or any related matter.  In fact, on the stand, the detective testified that appellant did not even fit a pedophile profile and that there was no evidence that linked him to prior sexual activities with children.  It was the Government that first mentioned the \"children\" as sex objects;  it was the Government that first used sexually explicit language involving the \"children\";  it was the Government that escalated the subject of sex with children;  and it was the Government that first brought up the use of photographic equipment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the latter, the entrapment issue becomes even more apparent with respect to the allegations of attempted manufacture of child pornography.  Appellant's response to \"Frances' \" suggestion of using a camera reveals how far photography was from his cerebrations or fantasies when he wrote:  \"No, I don't have any videocamera or access to one, I don't know anything about them.\"   The record is redundant with the Government's relentless reiteration of the subject to a person that was patently ignorant of this activity, even to the very last moment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning first to \"inducement,\" we think that, in light of our analysis in Gendron, the evidence of improper inducement here was sufficient to submit the question to the jury.  First, Gamache initially expressed only his desire for a sexual relationship with Frances and his intent to form a non-sexual relationship with her children.  In addition, the agent here manufactured the aura of a personal relationship between Gamache and the fictional \"Frances,\" and \"Frances\" disclosed her fictional illicit intentions only well into the correspondence.  These solicitations are quite similar to the type of \"psychologically graduated\" responses that the Jacobson Court found objectionable.  Second, the government agent provided justifications for the illicit activity (intergenerational sex) by describing \"herself\" as glad that Gamache was \"liberal\" like her, expressing that she, as the mother of the children, strongly approved of the illegal activity, and explaining that she had engaged in this conduct as a child and found it beneficial to her.  These solicitations suggested that Gamache ought to be allowed to engage in the illicit activity, just as the Government in Jacobson used a fake lobbying organization to appeal to anti-censorship motives.  Finally, the Government's sting commenced in May 1995 and did not result in any illegal conduct until January 1996.  Thus, the Government persevered for almost seven months to elicit the offense conduct.  In Gendron, we observed that, in Jacobson, the Government had conceded that its methods amounted to an \"improper inducement\" as a matter of law.  Gendron, 18 F.3d at 963 (citing Jacobson, 503 U.S. at 549 n. 2, 112 S.Ct. 1535).   We think that these \"extra elements\" are sufficient to satisfy the defendant's burden on the inducement prong.  See id. at 961.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the predisposition prong, under the analysis set forth in Jacobson, a reasonable jury could find that Gamache was not predisposed to commit the offense.  \"[P]roof that [the defendant] engaged in legal conduct and possessed certain generalized personal inclinations is not sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he would have been predisposed to commit the crime charged independent of the Government's coaxing.\"  Jacobson, 503 U.S. at 551 n. 3, 112 S.Ct. 1535.  As we explained in Gendron:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p>The evidence of predisposition [in Jacobson ] consisted of two facts:  (1) that before the government became involved Jacobson was on a private bookstore mailing list for dubious photos;  and (2) that he responded affirmatively to the government's solicitations.  The first fact ... showed little about a predisposition to act unlawfully because ordering the photos was lawful at the time....  The second, placing orders, could not show how Jacobson would have acted had the solicitation lacked ... the improper appeals to anti-censorship motives, the graduated response, and the lengthy time frame.  [As a result,] the government's evidence did not show how Jacobson would have acted had he been faced with an ordinary \"opportunity\" to commit the crime rather than a special \"inducement.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gendron, 18 F.3d at 963.   As in Jacobson, Gamache initially expressed an interest in unusual sexual activities, but these activities were not illegal with Frances.  Nor is the inference permissible that the tendency to engage in unusual, albeit legal, sexual activity with an adult indicates a predisposition towards pedophilia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Government responds that Gamache's enthusiastic response, as expressed in the correspondence, in conjunction with the lack of coercion and/or affirmative pressure by the Government agent, is enough to take the entrapment defense away from the jury.  We disagree.  Gamache's stated willingness to commit the crime, although clearly relevant to the jury's inquiry, is not sufficient by itself to mandate a finding that he was predisposed.  As Judge Posner explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p>Had the Court in Jacobson believed that the legal concept of predisposition is exhausted in the demonstrated willingness of the defendant to commit the crime without threats or promises by the government, then Jacobson was predisposed, in which event the Court's reversal of his conviction would be difficult to explain.  The government did not offer Jacobson any inducements to buy pornographic magazines or threaten him with harm if he failed to buy them.  It was not as if the government had had to badger Jacobson for 26 months in order to overcome his resistance to committing a crime.  He never resisted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Hollingsworth, 27 F.3d 1196, 1199 (7th Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, as we have noted, there was no evidence presented that Gamache had engaged in similar activities independent of this sting operation.  The jury could have relied on this evidence to find a lack of predisposition because the concept of predisposition has a definite temporal reference:  \"the inquiry must focus on a defendant's predisposition before contact with government officers or agents.\"  United States v. Brown, 43 F.3d 618, 627 (11th Cir.1995) (citing Jacobson, 503 U.S. at 547 n. 2, 112 S.Ct. 1535);  see also United States v. Gifford, 17 F.3d 462, 469 (1st Cir.1994) (identifying as \"critical\" the time \"in advance of the government's initial intervention\").  All of the Government's circumstantial evidence bearing on Gamache's intent when he crossed the state line resulted from the Government's initial contact.  The argument is clear in regard to his conviction for attempting to use a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing visual depictions.  Despite the Government's dogged insistence that Gamache bring a video camera, Gamache professed ignorance about such cameras and resisted purchasing one.  There is no evidence independent of Gamache's correspondence with the government agents--other than perhaps \"small condoms\" found on the defendant (which the defendant testified were \"finger cots\" that protected injuries to his fingers)--that indicated a predisposition to engage in illegal sexual contact with minors prior to, and apart from, the correspondence.  And while \"ready commission of the criminal act can itself adequately evince an individual's predisposition\" and thus provide sufficient evidence to support a jury's finding that the defendant was predisposed to commit the offense, Gifford, 17 F.3d at 469, eagerness alone, when coupled with the \"extra elements\" present in this sting operation, is not sufficient to remove the predisposition question from the jury's purview.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that appellant met the dual burdens required for an instruction on entrapment, because the evidence raises a reasonable doubt that the Government improperly induced a citizen to commit crimes that he was not predisposed to commit, yet crimes for which he was charged and convicted.  \"[E]ven where there are no credibility issues or tensions in the evidence--and some do exist here--entrapment is treated as an issue of fact for a jury.\"  Acosta, 67 F.3d at 338.   Although it is not dispositive of the issues before us, we take note of the fact that in sentencing appellant the district judge granted a downward departure from the Guidelines, based on his conclusion that appellant had engaged in \"aberrant behavior,\" a conclusion that would seems to include some element of lack of predisposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court committed reversible error in not giving an instruction on the issue of entrapment.  Appellant's conviction is reversed and a new trial is ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Third Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The Government argues that the defendant never specifically articulated an entrapment defense to the jury and thus that the record is barren of evidence that warrants an entrapment instruction.  The Government contends that, instead of presenting an entrapment defense, Gamache disclaimed that he committed any crime at all.  Therefore, the Government asserts, he never claimed improper inducement or lack of predisposition.  This argument seems to imply that a defendant who claims innocence cannot seek an entrapment instruction.  This is not the law.  The Supreme Court has held that \"even if the defendant denies one or more elements of the crime, he is entitled to an entrapment instruction whenever there is sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find entrapment.\"  Mathews v. United States, 485 U.S. 58, 65, 108 S.Ct. 883, 99 L.Ed.2d 54 (1988).  Thus, we must look to the record and determine whether there is evidence from which a jury could infer that Gamache was entrapped</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Appellant was charged and convicted in a jury trial in which it was alleged that he traveled in interstate commerce for the purpose of engaging in an illegal \"sexual act\" with minors, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2423(b), and that he attempted to use a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing visual depictions of that conduct, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2251(a).

These are:  (1) whether, as applied in this case, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2423(b) withstands a constitutional challenge based on the contention that it attempts to punish \"mere thoughts,\" and (2) whether the district court committed reversible error by not giving any jury instruction on the question of entrapment, notwithstanding appellant's request for such an instruction.  We conclude that, as applied to the facts of this case, the challenged statute punishes conduct, not \"mere thoughts\" as is claimed, and thus that it passes constitutional scrutiny.  However, we reverse appellant's conviction on both counts because we are of the view that he was entitled to have the jury instructed as to the defense of entrapment, and that the trial court's failure to give the instruction substantially affected his rights to a fair trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.

I am hoping that you think liberally about sex.  My family is very comfortable in front of the camera ...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial the detective testified that the use of the word \"mentor\" in the advertisement was purposeful in order to draw out only persons who were interested in \"inter-generational sexual interaction between adults and children.\"   Appellant testified, however, that after looking the term \"mentor\" up in the dictionary, he concluded that it meant \"like role model,\" that \"it was just another gal looking for somebody to take care of her kids like they do nowadays all over the country ... [f]inancially, take them fishing, hunting, whatever.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant next wrote the detective a lengthy letter, postmarked October 23, 1995:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>I find no problem, being a mentor to your children &amp; yes family fun does interest me.  I hunt, fish &amp; go camping, in fact I just bought a camper yesterday &amp; am getting it ready for next weekend.  My son &amp; friend &amp; I are going up north to deer hunt....  I also have a high speed bass boat--I fish in tournaments, I am very outdoorsie.  Also do ice fishing.  I also have a camper on my truck, so whenever your ready to meet me, we could meet at a certain location &amp; be comfortable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>You say you hope I am liberal about sex, I am not exactly sure of what you are referring to in this area.  So I guess I'll tell you what I think about sex.  First off let me tell you, that I am an easy going person, I enjoy life to the fullest.  I am not a jealous person &amp; do not like arguing or fighting.  I do not do drugs, only beer &amp; my smokes.  Sex to me is very special.  Before I got married in the early 80's I had a girlfriend &amp; we both were into the swinging scene.  We are/were both bi, it was one of the best periods of my life--I met some real nice couples &amp; we had many moments of pure enjoyment, in fact my swinging friends were better friends than my straight friends ...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>The great part was not only did we enjoy the sexual part, but we also did other non sexual things together, cookouts, camping &amp; saunas.  Yes F.F. I consider myself to be ultra liberal about sex ... Oh yes, I forgot, I enjoy going to the nudist camp in your fine state--but at present being single--they don't allow single males ...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>Well F.F. I've told you about me--now its your turn to tell me about you.  Some of my questions I have of you are:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>1.  What is it your looking for in life if it was with me?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>2. What are your interests?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>3. Are you a bisexual woman?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>4. Tell me about your family.  Oh yes--you said your family is very comfortable in front of the camera--what are you referring to?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>5. Could you send a photo of yourself, nude preferred, but not required.  Also one of the family.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>6. Do you use drugs, smoke or drink?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>7.

What do you do for work?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>9. Anything else that would be helpful in trying to get to know what you're like.  For both our sakes, it will be much better to know all we can about each other and accept what is!....   Well F.F. I guess I've told you about me, I hope in the near future, to hear about you....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>P.S.

You and your family can come here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>2. I can meet you at your place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>3. Anywhere in between.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 1, 1995 the detective returned this communication:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>I am glad you agree with the liberal upbringing of children, My 12-year-old son, and his 10 and 8-year-old sisters all practice nudism in our home.  They are very comfortable being naked in front of one another ... What I am talking about when I speak of family fun is that all of my children freely involve themselves in sex training sessions.  Some of these training sessions have been photographed.  The kids love to see themselves on video.  I am very interested in introducing an adult male to further my children's sexual education and experiences.  When I was a young girl my uncle was very kind to me and showed me the ways of love making.  Let me know if you are interested....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the first time in this series of exchanges, the detective answers as \"Frances\" instead of \"F.F.\" Appellant picks up on this and other suggestions in his answer to this letter, which is also postmarked November 1, 1995:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>You appear by your letters that you are trying to see if I am shocked by what you are telling me.  I can assure you, that I am not shocked, I really think you are a super person &amp; will have less problems with your children than most straight, prudish couples have with their kids.  It sounds like your looking for another uncle like you had, to give your children the same experience as you had--a loving, caring person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The way I look at all this--as everyone is willing to learn about sex &amp; is not forced, what harm is done?   None as far as I am concerned....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>You say you are very interested in introducing an adult man to further your children's sexual education &amp; experiences.  Frances I would be honored, if you choose me to be that adult man.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>Also Frances, as I told you, aside from the sex department--I am looking for a family type life, camping, fishing, hunting, sharing the ups &amp; downs of what life has to offer....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>Could you send me a picture of you &amp; the children?  ...  I guess I am trying to get a mental picture of you &amp; the children....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>This thought just came into my mind--you said the children freely involved themselves in sex training sessions, do you have sex with them?   Have you introduced your son to orgasm?   What are your goals--Teaching them straight sex, or bi-sex too?....   I want to have a better understanding of what you desire of me....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately two weeks later, on November 14, 1995, \"Frances\" wrote in return, again indicating that she wanted \"to expand [her] children's education and experience.\"  \"She\" also indicated that \"she\" shared appellant's nude photograph with them, and that they were \"very excited about meeting\" him.  \"Frances\" introduces her \"children,\" \"Steve,\" age 12, \"Jenny,\" age 10, and \"Sarah,\" who is \"just about to turn 8.\" The letter went on to say how she participated \"during sex training with [her] children,\" and proceeded to describe the nature of these activities, and what was expected of appellant in this respect.  The subject of the \"uncle\" was again raised, and \"Frances\" stated, \"I hope my children can gain the same type of experience through someone like you.\"   The clincher comes at the end when \"Frances\" expresses her desire to know appellant \"for real.  Maybe you have a video camera or have access to one, let me know.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's answer, postmarked November 20, 1995, is addressed to \"Frances, Steve, Jenny, &amp; Sarah.\"   Appellant expresses his understanding of \"Frances' \" request for secrecy, \"as we all know, it is against the law to be having sex with minors\"....   As to \"Frances' \" last suggestion, however, appellant states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>No I don't have a videocamera or access to one, I don't know anything about them.  But when we get together, I'll take you out &amp; you pick the one you like &amp; I'll buy it.  I always thought about getting one--but again I don't have a clue as to what make, model or anything about them.  You seem to have knowledge--So it will be your job to pick one out....  I do understand when you say you want to weed out weirdos &amp; people who would want to hurt your children....  I do not consider myself a pervert or a child molester....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p>You ask if I had any experiences &amp; my feelings with young people.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p>1. I get along very well with all my grand children, I've always been like a magnet with kids.  They seem to accept me very well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p>2. No Frances I've never had an opportunity to experience family fun before.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p>3. The closest I came to having one was when I was around 11 or 12....  [He recounts an experience with his stepmother]....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p>You asked if I am completely opposed to sexual touching with Steve?   Frances, ... I am bi-sexual!   If Steve is interested &amp; wants to learn the pleasures of bisexuality I'd be more than willing to touch, stimulate &amp; have oral sex with him....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Frances\" next communicated with appellant on November 28, 1995.  In this letter \"she\" again referred to the \"uncle [who] taught [her] about sex when [she] was very young, and wanting \"the same type of experience for [her] children.\"  \"Frances\" also tells appellant that she is not interested in finding a partner for herself \"right now\" as she is interested \"in introducing an adult to educate [her] children.\"  \"She\" indicates that she has been involved with their sexual education:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p>The kids really enjoy being in front of our video camera.

I would suggest you buy any of the new and smaller camcorders.  Any model will do.  Let us know which one you pick out, they are all good.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant wrote back in a letter postmarked December 1, 1995.  He suggested that they meet for a \"get acquainted\" meeting at McDonald's or Dunkin' Donuts on his way back from a trip he was making to Connecticut.  He wanted to know if in fact \"Frances\" was a woman:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p>I hope you understand this.  Your ad in TriState you asked for a partner and mentor for your children, now in this last letter you say your not interested in finding yourself a partner, rather you are more interested in finding an adult male for the children to educate them, I guess you really want an adult sex toy for kids....  I want you to know that I would be happy to be used as your toy for the further education of your children in the world of sex.  I've thought about you all daily &amp; have even come up with what I think is a good idea for the 1st class that the children and I could have--If your interested, tell me &amp; in the next letter, I'll give you a graphic detail of what the class would consist of!</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant then asks \"Frances\" a series of questions about the sexual experiences of the \"children.\"   And finally:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p>I am happy to hear you say you don't want to force me to do anything I don't feel comfortable with.  The only thing I don't feel comfortable with is the buying [of] a camcorder &amp; sending a video.  As I already told you, I don't have a clue about them or how to operate them....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Frances' \" next letter is dated December 11, 1995.  \"She\" encloses a photograph of \"herself\" and reiterates that \"she\" is \"mainly interested in finding some one who can sexually educate [\"her\"] children through having sex with them.\"   The letter then states that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p>I realize that this is something not everyone can do or feel comfortable with.  Let me know if you feel all right with this.  Maybe if you send a letter directly to the kids telling them about sex and what you hope to do with them when we all meet would be good.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"She\" then goes on to describe the \"children's\" sex experiences up to then, and that he should decide what he should do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p>Appellant next sent \"all of you\" a Christmas card post marked December 18, 1995 in which he stated that he wished he \"could have been your Christmas present laying under the tree.  Maybe next year.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On that same date appellant also wrote a lengthy letter directed to \"Frances,\" which responds to \"her's\" of the 11th:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p>I do want to thank you for the picture.  You are a very attractive lady, along with having very sensual eyes, I envy your uncle that you told me about--He was a very lucky man.  My hope is someday I may be as lucky.  Yes my dear, I know--you're not interested in me--but rather for the kids.  I was just letting you know how I feel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant then goes on to explain, at length and in detail, how he will carry about the sexual \"education\" of \"Frances' \" \"children\".  He ends by telling \"her\" that \"[t]he next letter will be for the kids--let them open it so it can be kind of personal for them.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">True to his word appellant next writes \"Steve, Jenny, and Sarah\" in a letter postmarked December 19, 1995, in which no words are spared describing the sexual activities that will take place when \"they\" \"begin having classes in the very near future--before they get married--Ha, Ha.\"  (underlining in the original).  Appellant ends the letter by asking \"them\" for a photograph, which \"[does not] have to be nude unless you'd like to.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Frances\" responded on December 22, 1995:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p>The kids really liked your letter and had a lot of questions about when we will all get together and the things you wrote about ... If you are still willing we would love to have you come and meet with us ... A motel would be nice.  I would like to meet in Keene, New Hampshire.  I will leave the planning up to you.  The kids told me that they would love to have oral sex with you the first time and any pictures or videos that are taken will be given to you as a gift.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 28, 1995, appellant answered \"Frances, Steve, Jenny, &amp; Sarah\" to the effect that \"[t]he fact that you all want to meet with me, make love &amp; a beautiful film is more than I could ever hope for.  I promise I will do all in my power to make you all happy, both in the sexual department &amp; also in normal life activities, if you will let me.\"   He goes on to state that \"this will be a new experience for me as well.\"   The rest of the letter deals mainly with the arrangements for the meeting, which appellant suggests take place at the Troy (N.H.) Post Office.  He proposes that, from there, all of them travel to Keene.  Appellant ends by asking for a \"regular picture of the kids to put on [his] dresser\" next to \"Frances'.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Frances\" answered on January 3, 1996, indicating that the \"kids\" were \"very excited about your being involved in their sexual sessions and your bringing a video camera to make a film.  Since it will be our first time you may keep the film.\"  \"She\" was not agreeable to the Troy suggestion, however, and insisted on a motel in Keene.  As to the request for the \"children's\" photo, \"she\" also rejected the request and told appellant that he was \"free to take as many pictures as you want when we meet.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's final letter is postmarked January 3, 1995, and again it is addressed to \"Frances, Steve, Jenny &amp; Sarah.\"   The final plans for the meeting are proposed, with the date of January 20th and the \"Super 8 Motel\" in Keene being suggested as the time and place to meet.  Appellant draws a map with directions as to how to get there and indicates that he will sit in his truck in the parking area until \"they\" come along side him.  Then he will get out and approach \"them.\"   He includes a photograph of his truck so \"they\" will recognize it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the last of this distasteful correspondence, dated January 16, 1996, \"Frances\" tells appellant that everything is on course for the meeting but that \"our video camera is broken so I will leave the video or pictures (your choice) up to you.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The line and bait cast, all that remained was the setting of the hook.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the appointed date, appellant drove from his home in Maine to Keene, New Hampshire, arriving at about 1:00 p.m. at the parking lot of the Super 8 Motel in that town, where he parked his truck awaiting the arrival of \"Frances\" and the \"kids.\"   Observing his arrival, however, was the Keene detective who had commenced the events that eventually led to this encounter.  Upon matching appellant's vehicle with the Polaroid photo that Gamache had sent \"Frances\" on January 3, which showed a pickup truck with a camper, the detective and other accompanying police officers approached appellant, who had remained seated in the vehicle, and proceeded to arrest him and to execute an anticipatory search warrant that had been issued against appellant and his vehicle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Inside the cab were found bags of snacks and candy, several two-liter bottles of soda, a bottle of wine, eleven styrofoam cups, a jar of mixed nuts, a vibrator, a Polaroid camera loaded with film, ten extra cartridges of film, nine condoms, a lubricating jelly tube, a partially used tube of jelly, and a number of items conflictingly described as \"small condoms\" by the detective and as \"finger cots\" by appellant, who testified at trial that they are used to protect injured fingers.  Several of these latter items were also found in appellant's pockets, within a plastic bag which also contained jelly and adult condoms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While this incident was developing, the Brunswick, Maine police were executing a search warrant of appellant's home, where they found a road map with the town of Keene circled, \"Frances' \" letters to appellant, and a note on a marker board in the kitchen, written by appellant's roommate, telling him not to forget his camera.

Appellant did not abstractly contemplate crossing state boundaries with a thought to committing a crime upon reaching his destination.  Appellant did not merely sit in the quiet of his house, contemplate evil thoughts, and then flip the channels of his television set, and continue blithely with other musings.  Appellant is not charged, nor does this statute, as applied, punish mere voyeurism.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the record clearly establishes, appellant, at a minimum, engaged in a series of acts long past the \"mere thinking\" stage.

This series of acts includes the interchange of extensive correspondence that eventually led to the actual trip and that shows that at some point he became an active participant in the planning of this trip;  the purchasing of supplies, and their transportation in his vehicle (supplies which, it could be argued, were designed to be used to carry out his allegedly nefarious purposes);  and his actual traveling to the subject place, on the subject date, at least arguably (if you interpret the evidence in favor of the Government, see United States v. Loder, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195365\"><a href=\"/opinion/195365/united-states-v-loder/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span>, 589 (1st Cir.1994)), ready, willing and able to carry out his \"educational\" mission.

The \"other\" act language concedes that at least one act took place, i.e., crossing a state line, which is something more than \"mere thought\".  An alternate interpretation of this claim presupposes that Congress cannot criminalize a single act.  This is a novel theory for which we can find no support.  One clearly defined act is sufficient.  In this case, the act is \"traveling in interstate commerce,\" a phrase which supplies not only the jurisdictional basis for the federalization of the proscribed conduct, but also the \"objective act\" that facilitates the proof of the intent, together with the other evidence introduced.

After reviewing the Government's persistent encouragements, which included letters from fictional lobbying organizations that claimed to promote sexual freedoms, the Supreme Court found that Jacobson's \"ready response to these solicitations cannot be enough to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that he was predisposed, prior to the Government acts intended to create predisposition, to commit the crime.\"  Id. at 553, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112720\"><a href=\"/opinion/112720/jacobson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

United States v.

We explained that the Government \"sting\" in Jacobson did more than simply offer an \"ordinary opportunity\" to buy child pornography.  Rather, that sting combined an ordinary opportunity with certain \"extra elements\" so that there was a \"risk of catching in the law enforcement net not only those who might well have committed the crime elsewhere (in the absence of the sting), but also those who (in its absence) likely would never have done so.\"  Gendron, 18 F.3d at 961.   We then identified three such \"extra elements.\"   First, the Government's operation \"reflected a psychologically 'graduated' set of responses to Jacobson's own noncriminal responses, beginning with innocent lures and progressing to frank offers.\"  Id. at 962.   Second, the Government's solicitations appealed to alternative motives (i.e., anti-censorship motives), see id., which suggested that the illicit conduct was \"something the [defendant] ought to be allowed to do,\" Jacobson, 503 U.S. at 553, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112720\"><a href=\"/opinion/112720/jacobson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without unduly repeating the details of this depressing record, we survey the relevant evidence.  It is undisputed that the Government initiated this victimless incident with its advertisement.  Thereafter, a stream of correspondence followed even after it became apparent, from the initial letters, that appellant was on a different wavelength than the detective.  Appellant was interested in having sex with the adult \"Frances.\"   His initial response was directed to \"F.F.\"/\"Frances,\" not her \"children.\"   What each understood \"mentor\" and \"family fun\" to mean, at least at the beginning, was very different, and this can be garnered not only from reading the correspondence, but also from both the detective's and appellant's testimony at trial.  Appellant ultimately became ensnared by the detective's artifice.  The record is clear that it was the Government's insistence and artful manipulation of appellant that finally drew him into the web skillfully spun by the detective.  To this we must add that it was appellant's contention, and he so testified, that all of his correspondence about sex with minors was a ruse to have sex with \"Frances,\" who was his target from the time that he answered the ad.  Although this version is obviously disputed by the Government, that is irrelevant to the question of whether it raises an issue of entrapment to be put before the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, appellant had no criminal record, particularly as to the child molestation, exploitation, or any related matter.  In fact, on the stand, the detective testified that appellant did not even fit a pedophile profile and that there was no evidence that linked him to prior sexual activities with children.  It was the Government that first mentioned the \"children\" as sex objects;  it was the Government that first used sexually explicit language involving the \"children\";  it was the Government that escalated the subject of sex with children;  and it was the Government that first brought up the use of photographic equipment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the latter, the entrapment issue becomes even more apparent with respect to the allegations of attempted manufacture of child pornography.  Appellant's response to \"Frances' \" suggestion of using a camera reveals how far photography was from his cerebrations or fantasies when he wrote:  \"No, I don't have any videocamera or access to one, I don't know anything about them.\"   The record is redundant with the Government's relentless reiteration of the subject to a person that was patently ignorant of this activity, even to the very last moment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning first to \"inducement,\" we think that, in light of our analysis in Gendron, the evidence of improper inducement here was sufficient to submit the question to the jury.  First, Gamache initially expressed only his desire for a sexual relationship with Frances and his intent to form a non-sexual relationship with her children.  In addition, the agent here manufactured the aura of a personal relationship between Gamache and the fictional \"Frances,\" and \"Frances\" disclosed her fictional illicit intentions only well into the correspondence.  These solicitations are quite similar to the type of \"psychologically graduated\" responses that the Jacobson Court found objectionable.  Second, the government agent provided justifications for the illicit activity (intergenerational sex) by describing \"herself\" as glad that Gamache was \"liberal\" like her, expressing that she, as the mother of the children, strongly approved of the illegal activity, and explaining that she had engaged in this conduct as a child and found it beneficial to her.  These solicitations suggested that Gamache ought to be allowed to engage in the illicit activity, just as the Government in Jacobson used a fake lobbying organization to appeal to anti-censorship motives.  Finally, the Government's sting commenced in May 1995 and did not result in any illegal conduct until January 1996.  Thus, the Government persevered for almost seven months to elicit the offense conduct.  In Gendron, we observed that, in Jacobson, the Government had conceded that its methods amounted to an \"improper inducement\" as a matter of law.  Gendron, 18 F.3d at 963 (citing Jacobson, 503 U.S. at 549 n. 2, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112720\"><a href=\"/opinion/112720/jacobson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1535</span></a></span>).   We think that these \"extra elements\" are sufficient to satisfy the defendant's burden on the inducement prong.  See id. at 961.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the predisposition prong, under the analysis set forth in Jacobson, a reasonable jury could find that Gamache was not predisposed to commit the offense.  \"[P]roof that [the defendant] engaged in legal conduct and possessed certain generalized personal inclinations is not sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he would have been predisposed to commit the crime charged independent of the Government's coaxing.\"  Jacobson, 503 U.S. at 551 n. 3, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112720\"><a href=\"/opinion/112720/jacobson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

As we explained in Gendron:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p>The evidence of predisposition [in Jacobson ] consisted of two facts:  (1) that before the government became involved Jacobson was on a private bookstore mailing list for dubious photos;  and (2) that he responded affirmatively to the government's solicitations.  The first fact ... showed little about a predisposition to act unlawfully because ordering the photos was lawful at the time....  The second, placing orders, could not show how Jacobson would have acted had the solicitation lacked ... the improper appeals to anti-censorship motives, the graduated response, and the lengthy time frame.  [As a result,] the government's evidence did not show how Jacobson would have acted had he been faced with an ordinary \"opportunity\" to commit the crime rather than a special \"inducement.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gendron, 18 F.3d at 963.   As in Jacobson, Gamache initially expressed an interest in unusual sexual activities, but these activities were not illegal with Frances.  Nor is the inference permissible that the tendency to engage in unusual, albeit legal, sexual activity with an adult indicates a predisposition towards pedophilia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Government responds that Gamache's enthusiastic response, as expressed in the correspondence, in conjunction with the lack of coercion and/or affirmative pressure by the Government agent, is enough to take the entrapment defense away from the jury.  We disagree.  Gamache's stated willingness to commit the crime, although clearly relevant to the jury's inquiry, is not sufficient by itself to mandate a finding that he was predisposed.  As Judge Posner explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p>Had the Court in Jacobson believed that the legal concept of predisposition is exhausted in the demonstrated willingness of the defendant to commit the crime without threats or promises by the government, then Jacobson was predisposed, in which event the Court's reversal of his conviction would be difficult to explain.  The government did not offer Jacobson any inducements to buy pornographic magazines or threaten him with harm if he failed to buy them.  It was not as if the government had had to badger Jacobson for 26 months in order to overcome his resistance to committing a crime.  He never resisted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v.

The jury could have relied on this evidence to find a lack of predisposition because the concept of predisposition has a definite temporal reference:  \"the inquiry must focus on a defendant's predisposition before contact with government officers or agents.\"  United States v.

All of the Government's circumstantial evidence bearing on Gamache's intent when he crossed the state line resulted from the Government's initial contact.  The argument is clear in regard to his conviction for attempting to use a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing visual depictions.  Despite the Government's dogged insistence that Gamache bring a video camera, Gamache professed ignorance about such cameras and resisted purchasing one.  There is no evidence independent of Gamache's correspondence with the government agents--other than perhaps \"small condoms\" found on the defendant (which the defendant testified were \"finger cots\" that protected injuries to his fingers)--that indicated a predisposition to engage in illegal sexual contact with minors prior to, and apart from, the correspondence.  And while \"ready commission of the criminal act can itself adequately evince an individual's predisposition\" and thus provide sufficient evidence to support a jury's finding that the defendant was predisposed to commit the offense, Gifford, 17 F.3d at 469, eagerness alone, when coupled with the \"extra elements\" present in this sting operation, is not sufficient to remove the predisposition question from the jury's purview.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that appellant met the dual burdens required for an instruction on entrapment, because the evidence raises a reasonable doubt that the Government improperly induced a citizen to commit crimes that he was not predisposed to commit, yet crimes for which he was charged and convicted.  \"[E]ven where there are no credibility issues or tensions in the evidence--and some do exist here--entrapment is treated as an issue of fact for a jury.\"  Acosta, 67 F.3d at 338.   Although it is not dispositive of the issues before us, we take note of the fact that in sentencing appellant the district judge granted a downward departure from the Guidelines, based on his conclusion that appellant had engaged in \"aberrant behavior,\" a conclusion that would seems to include some element of lack of predisposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court committed reversible error in not giving an instruction on the issue of entrapment.  Appellant's conviction is reversed and a new trial is ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Third Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The Government argues that the defendant never specifically articulated an entrapment defense to the jury and thus that the record is barren of evidence that warrants an entrapment instruction.  The Government contends that, instead of presenting an entrapment defense, Gamache disclaimed that he committed any crime at all.  Therefore, the Government asserts, he never claimed improper inducement or lack of predisposition.  This argument seems to imply that a defendant who claims innocence cannot seek an entrapment instruction.  This is not the law.  The Supreme Court has held that \"even if the defendant denies one or more elements of the crime, he is entitled to an entrapment instruction whenever there is sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find entrapment.\"  Mathews v.

Thus, we must look to the record and determine whether there is evidence from which a jury could infer that Gamache was entrapped</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
