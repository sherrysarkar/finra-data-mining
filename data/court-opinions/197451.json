This  case  concerns  the  personal\r\n\nguaranties \r                      by \r                         James \r                              W. \r                                 Flett and John J. Arno of a loan made to\r\n\nHopping Brook  Trust by the  Home National  Bank of  Milford,\r\n\nMassachusetts\r                        .  The facts of the case are clearly set forth in\r\n\nthe \r               district \r                        court's opinion, F.D.I.C. v. Hopping Brook Trust,\r\n\n941 F.  Supp. 256 (D.  Mass. 1996).   Because we believe  the\r\n\ndistrict  court analyzed  the appealed  issues correctly,  we\r\n\naffirm on the basis of the district court's opinion.  We  add\r\n\nonly a few paragraphs for clarification.\r\n\n          Flett and Arno premise their contention that  their\r\n\nobligations  under the  guaranties were  discharged on  three\r\n\narguments.  \r\n\n          First, they assert that Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 244,  S\r\n\n17B  required the F.D.I.C.  to notify them  of its intent  to\r\n\nforeclose the mortgage.1  The Massachusetts courts have  held\r\n\nthat \r                S \r                  17B \r                     does \r                          not \r                              require the notification of guarantors, see\r\n\nSenior Corp. v. Perine, 452 N.E.2d 1160, 1161 (Mass. App. Ct.\r\n\n1983). \r                   \r                   Flett and Arno argue, nonetheless, that S 17B required\r\n\nnotifying \r                     them \r                         because, \r                                  despite the use of the term \"guarantor\"\r\n\nin the agreements, they are not really guarantors but primary\r\n\nobligors.  They point to language in the guaranties providing\r\n\n1.  Mass. Gen. Laws c. 244, S 17B states, in relevant part,\r\n\"No action for a deficiency shall be brought . . . by the\r\nholder of a mortgage note or other obligation secured by\r\nmortgage of real estate after a foreclosure sale by him\r\n. . . unless a notice in writing of the mortgagee's intention\r\nto foreclose the mortgage has been mailed . . . to the\r\ndefendant sought to be charged with the deficiency . . . .\"  \r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nfor  \"primary, direct  and  immediate\"  liability,  and  cite\r\n\nChestnut Manor, Inc.  v. Abraham, 452 N.E.2d 258, 259  (Mass.\r\n\nApp. Ct. 1983),  for the proposition that guarantors who  are\r\n\ndirectly  and  unconditionally  liable  are  really   primary\r\n\nobligors. \r\n\n          Flett's and Arno's  reliance on Chestnut Manor,  an\r\n\nintermediate appellate decision not involving the application\r\n\nof \r              S \r                17B, \r                     is \r                       misplaced. \r                                   \r                                   While the short exposition in Chestnut\r\n\nManor\r                 \r                 leaves \r                        it unclear why the \"guarantors\" in that case were\r\n\nheld to be primary obligors, an earlier Massachusetts Supreme\r\n\nJudicial Court  case cited in  Chestnut Manor indicates  that\r\n\nFlett and Arno were,  in any event, genuine guarantors.   See\r\n\nCharlestown \r                       Five Cents Sav. Bank v. Wolf, 36 N.E.2d 390 (Mass.\r\n\n1941) (superseded by statute on a separate issue).\r\n\n          In Wolf, the  Massachusetts Supreme Judicial  Court\r\n\nstated:\r\n\n          The intention of  the parties  as to  the\r\n          character of the liability assumed by the\r\n          defendant[] . .  . is  to be  ascertained\r\n          from  a  fair  construction  of  all  the\r\n          language appearing in the note and in the\r\n          [guaranty], according to the usual  rules\r\n          of interpretation,  in the  light of  the\r\n          subject  matter involved  and  by  giving\r\n          appropriate \r                                 effect to all the words in the\r\n          note and in the [guaranty] where that  is\r\n          reasonably practicable.\r\n\nWolf, 36 N.E.2d at 391.  \r\n\n          The \r                         state's \r                                 highest court went on to reason that the\r\n\nuse of the term \"guaranty\" and the inclusion of certain types\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nof waivers  in the  agreement would  only make  sense if  the\r\n\nagreement was in fact a guaranty.  The Supreme Judicial Court\r\n\nwrote:\r\n\n          The  word \"guarantee\"  appearing  in  the\r\n          memorandum suggests, not a primary, but a\r\n          collateral  undertaking  .  .  .  .   The\r\n          phrases, \"waiving demand and notice\", and\r\n          \"No extension  or indulgence  or  partial\r\n          release shall prevent my remaining  fully\r\n          liable\",  are  superfluous  if,  as   the\r\n          plaintiff contends, the parties  intended\r\n          that \r                          the \r                              defendant[] . . . should become a\r\n          comaker of the note.  A demand or  notice\r\n          is not necessary in order to hold a party\r\n          who is primarily liable  on a note and  a\r\n          comaker of a note would not be discharged\r\n          by any  indulgence or  extension of  time\r\n          granted by the payee to another  comaker.\r\n          But  the  phrases  above  quoted   would,\r\n          however, have  real significance  if  the\r\n          obligation of the defendant[] . . .   was\r\n          that of a guarantor.\r\n\nId. at 391-92 (citations omitted).\r\n\n          Similarly,  in this  case, the  agreement was  titled\r\n\n\"Guaranty,\" \r                     contained \r                              an \r                                 explicit waiver of \"presentment and demand\r\n\nfor payment  and  protest of  non-payment\"  (paragraph 4  of  the\r\n\nguaranties), and stated that  the guarantors would remain  liable\r\n\neven \r              if \r                 the \r                    lender \r                           \"waive[d] compliance with, or any default under,\r\n\nor \r            grant[ed] \r                      any \r                         other \r                               indulgences with respect to, the Note or any\r\n\nagreement or instrument  securing the Note,\" (paragraph 2 of  the\r\n\nguaranties).  These waivers would have been superfluous if  Flett\r\n\nand Arno were primary obligors  rather than guarantors.  Id.   We\r\n\nagree with  the district court that  Flett and Arno were  genuine\r\n\nguarantors.  See Hopping Brook Trust, 941 F.Supp. at 261 n.1.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n          Flett's and Arno's second argument, not discussed  by\r\n\nthe district court, is that they are discharged under a provision\r\n\nof Massachusetts' version of  the Uniform Commercial Code,  Mass.\r\n\nGen. Laws ch. 106, S 3-606.2  The short answer to this contention\r\n\nis that  Article 3  of the U.C.C.  does not  apply to  guaranties\r\n\nbecause \r                 guaranties \r                           are \r                               not negotiable instruments.  See Pemstein v.\r\n\nStimpson, 630 N.E.2d 608, 613 (Mass. App. Ct. 1994).  Flett's and\r\n\nArno's attempts to avoid this rule  of law by claiming not to  be\r\n\nguarantors but primary obligors  fails for the reasons  discussed\r\n\nabove.\r\n\n          Flett's and Arno's third and final contention is that\r\n\nthey \r              are \r                 discharged \r                            under the common law because of an amendment to\r\n\nthe \r             Construction \r                         Loan \r                              Agreement effected some three weeks after the\r\n\nother agreements were signed.  The amendment provided,  \"Borrower\r\n\nshall \r               pay \r                   to \r                     Lender, \r                             on \r                                a partial release basis, the sum of $40,000\r\n\n2.  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 106, S 3-606 states, in relevant\r\npart:\r\n\n   (1) The holder discharges any party to the instrument\r\n   to the extent that without such party's consent the\r\n   holder\r\n        (a) without express reservation of rights\r\n        releases or agrees not to sue any person\r\n        against whom the party has to the knowledge\r\n        of the holder a right of recourse or agrees\r\n        to suspend the right to enforce against such\r\n        person the instrument or collateral or\r\n        otherwise discharges such person, except that\r\n        failure or delay in effecting any required\r\n        presentment, protest or notice of dishonor\r\n        with respect to any such person does not\r\n        discharge any party as to whom presentment,\r\n        protest or notice of dishonor is effective or\r\n        unnecessary . . . .\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nper acre  on the  sale or transfer  by Borrower  of any  property\r\n\ncovered under and secured by the Mortgage.\"  Flett and Arno argue\r\n\nthat  this amendment  materially  and prejudicially  altered  the\r\n\nunderlying \r                    loan \r                        which \r                              they had guarantied, resulting in a discharge\r\n\nunder the doctrine of Warren  v. Lyons, 25 N.E. 721 (Mass.  1890)\r\n\n(holding that a  guarantor's obligations may  be discharged by  a\r\n\nprejudicial change  to  the  guarantied agreement  to  which  the\r\n\nguarantor did not consent).\r\n\n          To  the district  court's  clear explanation  of  its\r\n\nrejection of this argument we add only that language in paragraph\r\n\n2  of the  guaranties  expressly waived  any  claim of  legal  or\r\n\nequitable discharge.  The guaranties stated, \"The obligations  of\r\n\nguarantor \r                   under this guaranty shall be unconditional, irrespective\r\n\nof the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the\r\n\nNote or  any  other  [sic] circumstances  which  might  otherwise\r\n\nconstitute  a  legal  or  equitable  discharge  of  a  surety  or\r\n\nguarantor.\" \r                      \r                      Such \r                          broad \r                                waivers are enforceable under Massachusetts\r\n\nlaw. \r               \r               See\r                   \r                   Sha\r                      wmut Bank, N.A. v.

The facts of the case are clearly set forth in the district court's opinion, F.D.I.C. v. Hopping Brook Trust, 941 F.Supp. 256 (D.Mass.1996).  Because we believe the district court analyzed the appealed issues correctly, we affirm on the basis of the district court's opinion.

Gen.

Perine, 16 Mass.App.Ct. 967, 452 N.E.2d 1160, 1161 (1983).  Flett and Arno argue, nonetheless, that &#167; 17B required notifying them because, despite the use of the term \"guarantor\" in the agreements, they are not really guarantors but primary obligors.  They point to language in the guaranties providing for \"primary, direct and immediate\" liability, and cite Chestnut Manor, Inc. v. Abraham, 16 Mass.App.Ct. 960, 452 N.E.2d 258, 259 (1983), for the proposition that guarantors who are directly and unconditionally liable are really primary obligors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flett's and Arno's reliance on Chestnut Manor, an intermediate appellate decision not involving the application of &#167; 17B, is misplaced.  While the short exposition in Chestnut Manor leaves it unclear why the \"guarantors\" in that case were held to be primary obligors, an earlier Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court case cited in Chestnut Manor indicates that Flett and Arno were, in any event, genuine guarantors.

A demand or notice is not necessary in order to hold a party who is primarily liable on a note and a comaker of a note would not be discharged by any indulgence or extension of time granted by the payee to another comaker.  But the phrases above quoted would, however, have real significance if the obligation of the defendant[ ] ... was that of a guarantor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. 36 N.E.2d at 391-92 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, in this case, the agreement was titled \"Guaranty,\" contained an explicit waiver of \"presentment and demand for payment and protest of non-payment\" (paragraph 4 of the guaranties), and stated that the guarantors would remain liable even if the lender \"waive[d] compliance with, or any default under, or grant[ed] any other indulgences with respect to, the Note or any agreement or instrument securing the Note,\" (paragraph 2 of the guaranties).  These waivers would have been superfluous if Flett and Arno were primary obligors rather than guarantors.  Id. We agree with the district court that Flett and Arno were genuine guarantors.  See Hopping Brook Trust, 941 F.Supp. at 261 n. 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flett's and Arno's second argument, not discussed by the district court, is that they are discharged under a provision of Massachusetts' version of the Uniform Commercial Code, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 106, &#167; 3-606.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The short answer to this contention is that Article 3 of the U.C.C. does not apply to guaranties because guaranties are not negotiable instruments.  See Pemstein v. Stimpson, 36 Mass.App.Ct. 283, 630 N.E.2d 608, 613 (1994).  Flett's and Arno's attempts to avoid this rule of law by claiming not to be guarantors but primary obligors fails for the reasons discussed above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flett's and Arno's third and final contention is that they are discharged under the common law because of an amendment to the Construction Loan Agreement effected some three weeks after the other agreements were signed.  The amendment provided, \"Borrower shall pay to Lender, on a partial release basis, the sum of $40,000 per acre on the sale or transfer by Borrower of any property covered under and secured by the Mortgage.\"   Flett and Arno argue that this amendment materially and prejudicially altered the underlying loan which they had guarantied, resulting in a discharge under the doctrine of Warren v. Lyons, 152 Mass. 310, 25 N.E. 721 (1890) (holding that a guarantor's obligations may be discharged by a prejudicial change to the guarantied agreement to which the guarantor did not consent).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the district court's clear explanation of its rejection of this argument we add only that language in paragraph 2 of the guaranties expressly waived any claim of legal or equitable discharge.  The guaranties stated, \"The obligations of guarantor under this guaranty shall be unconditional, irrespective of the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Note or any other [sic] circumstances which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge of a surety or guarantor.\"   Such broad waivers are enforceable under Massachusetts law.

Flett and John J. Arno of a loan made to Hopping Brook Trust by the Home National Bank of Milford, Massachusetts.  The facts of the case are clearly set forth in the district court's opinion, F.D.I.C. v. Hopping Brook Trust, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">941</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">256</span></span> (D.Mass.1996).  Because we believe the district court analyzed the appealed issues correctly, we affirm on the basis of the district court's opinion.  We add only a few paragraphs for clarification.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flett and Arno premise their contention that their obligations under the guaranties were discharged on three arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, they assert that Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 244, &#167; 17B required the F.D.I.C. to notify them of its intent to foreclose the mortgage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The Massachusetts courts have held that &#167; 17B does not require the notification of guarantors, see Senior Corp. v. Perine, 16 Mass.App.Ct. 967, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1160</span></span>, 1161 (1983).  Flett and Arno argue, nonetheless, that &#167; 17B required notifying them because, despite the use of the term \"guarantor\" in the agreements, they are not really guarantors but primary obligors.  They point to language in the guaranties providing for \"primary, direct and immediate\" liability, and cite Chestnut Manor, Inc. v. Abraham, 16 Mass.App.Ct. 960, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></span>, 259 (1983), for the proposition that guarantors who are directly and unconditionally liable are really primary obligors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Flett's and Arno's reliance on Chestnut Manor, an intermediate appellate decision not involving the application of &#167; 17B, is misplaced.  While the short exposition in Chestnut Manor leaves it unclear why the \"guarantors\" in that case were held to be primary obligors, an earlier Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court case cited in Chestnut Manor indicates that Flett and Arno were, in any event, genuine guarantors.  See Charlestown Five Cents Sav. Bank v. Wolf, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">309</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">390</span></span> (1941) (superseded by statute on a separate issue).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Wolf, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>The intention of the parties as to the character of the liability assumed by the defendant[ ] ... is to be ascertained from a fair construction of all the language appearing in the note and in the [guaranty], according to the usual rules of interpretation, in the light of the subject matter involved and by giving appropriate effect to all the words in the note and in the [guaranty] where that is reasonably practicable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wolf, 36 N.E.2d at 391.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state's highest court went on to reason that the use of the term \"guaranty\" and the inclusion of certain types of waivers in the agreement would only make sense if the agreement was in fact a guaranty.  The Supreme Judicial Court wrote:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>The word \"guarantee\" appearing in the memorandum suggests, not a primary, but a collateral undertaking....
