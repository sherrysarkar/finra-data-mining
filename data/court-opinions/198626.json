Robert B. Collings, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Stahl, Circuit Judge,\r\n               Magill, Senior Circuit Judge,*\r\n                  and Lipez, Circuit Judge\r\n\n   Robert S.

Sherman and David B.\r\nMack were on brief for appellees.\r\n\nSeptember 8, 1999\r\n\n   *Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.  LIPEZ, Circuit Judge. This case requires us to decide\r\nwhether a police officer sued for making an allegedly illegal\r\narrest can invoke the \"related crimes\" defense in asserting\r\nqualified immunity.  The defense, adopted by a number of other\r\ncircuits, provides \"that even where there is no probable cause to\r\narrest the plaintiff for the crime charged, proof of probable cause\r\nto arrest the plaintiff for a related offense is also a defense\r\nwhich may entitle the arresting officer to qualified immunity.\"\r\nAvery v. King, 110 F.3d 12, 14 (6th Cir. 1997).  The district court\r\nadopted the related crimes defense and granted summary judgment for\r\nthe defendant police officer.  Although we conclude that a police\r\nofficer is entitled to invoke the related crimes defense, we must\r\nvacate the district court's entry of summary judgment.  There\r\nexists a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the \r\ndefendant police officer, Rita Quinn, clearly did not have probable\r\ncause to arrest plaintiff Richard Sheehy for disorderly conduct,\r\nthe crime cited by the officer as the basis for the arrest at the\r\nscene.  We further conclude that the related crimes defense should\r\nnot apply to assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, the crime\r\ncharged at the police station after the arrest.                               I.\r\nThis case stems from an altercation between two neighbors\r\nin the town of Plymouth, Massachusetts.  Following a long and\r\ncontentious relationship with Warren Baker, Richard Sheehy got into\r\nan argument with Baker on Baker's property. Baker punched Sheehy in\r\nthe eye and, in an effort to stop Baker from hitting him again,\r\nSheehy grabbed Baker's shoulder.  Sheehy lost his balance and fell\r\non top of Baker. Baker started yelling for someone to call the\r\npolice.\r\n A number of officers arrived at the scene.  They were\r\nfamiliar with Baker, having been called to Baker's residence on a\r\nnumber of prior occasions, and they did not take the situation very\r\nseriously.  A sergeant at the scene questioned Sheehy about the\r\ndisturbance and asked him if he was going to file a complaint. \r\nSheehy informed the sergeant that he would not be filing a\r\ncomplaint.\r\nOfficer Quinn then arrived at the scene.  She first went\r\nto Baker's house where Baker told her that Sheehy had assaulted and\r\nkicked him.  Officer Quinn had been to Baker's house before to\r\ninvestigate disturbances, and had always found him to be truthful.\r\nAlthough she could smell alcohol on his breath, she did not think\r\nhe was drunk.  Officer Quinn then went across the street to\r\nSheehy's driveway where Sheehy was washing his boat.  There were \r\nfour bystanders in the driveway, and one of them was shouting and\r\nvisibly upset.  Officer Quinn attempted to question Sheehy, but he\r\nrefused to respond, telling Officer Quinn that he had already given\r\nhis name and address to the sergeant.  She told him that \"I'm the\r\ninvestigating officer now, and I am not going to put up with this\r\n. . . you know, either you give me identification or I arrest you.\" \r\nSheehy put his hands out and said, \"Then just arrest me.\"  Officer\r\nQuinn said, \"You're under arrest.\"  Sheehy asked what he was being\r\narrested for and Officer Quinn responded: \"For not giving me your\r\nname.\" Sheehy, a retired state trooper, told her she did not have\r\nthe authority to arrest him for failure to provide his name. \r\nOfficer Quinn's partner then told Sheehy that he was being arrested\r\nfor being a disorderly person.  Sheehy asked how he could be a\r\ndisorderly person in his own yard and added, \"What constitutes\r\nbeing disorderly, I haven't opened my mouth.\"  Officer Quinn's\r\npartner responded, \"Failure to give your name.\"  \r\nSheehy was handcuffed and taken to the police station\r\nwhere he was charged with assault and battery with a dangerous\r\nweapon and being a disorderly person.  Sheehy pled not guilty at\r\nhis arraignment.  At a pretrial conference, the district attorney\r\nrefused to prosecute and the charges were dismissed.\r\nSheehy then filed suit in Massachusetts state court\r\nagainst Officer Quinn and the town of Plymouth, pursuant inter alia\r\nto 42 U.S.C.  1983, alleging that his arrest was in violation of\r\nthe Fourth Amendment because Officer Quinn did not have probable\r\ncause to arrest him for disorderly conduct or assault and battery\r\nwith a dangerous weapon.  The case was subsequently removed to the\r\nfederal district court for the District of Massachusetts.  After\r\nremoval, Officer Quinn filed a motion for summary judgment,\r\nclaiming that she was entitled to qualified immunity.  The district\r\ncourt agreed, adopting the related crimes defense.  The district\r\ncourt concluded that Officer Quinn had probable cause to arrest\r\nSheehy for simple assault and battery, and further concluded that\r\nassault and battery and the crime charged at the police station\r\n(i.e., assault and battery with a dangerous weapon) were clearly\r\nrelated.   The district court entered a summary judgment against\r\nSheehy on his one federal claim under 42 U.S.C.  1983 and remanded\r\nthe remaining state law claims for disposition in the state court.\r\nSheehy now appeals.   \r\n                            II.\r\nThe district court's entry of summary judgment is\r\nreviewed de novo.  See Vargas-Badillo v. Diaz-Torres, 114 F.3d 3,\r\n5 (1st Cir. 1997).  We consider whether \"the pleadings,\r\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\r\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine\r\nissue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a\r\njudgment as a matter of law.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  We review\r\nthe record in a light most favorable to the party opposing the\r\nsummary judgment and we will indulge in all reasonable inferences\r\nin that party's favor.  See Rivera v. Murphy, 979 F.2d 259, 261\r\n(1st Cir. 1992).  Where there is no dispute over the underlying\r\nmaterial facts, \"a defendant's entitlement to qualified immunity is\r\na question of law and is reserved for plenary review by this\r\ncourt.\" Id.\r\nGenerally, government officials performing discretionary\r\nfunctions (such as arrests) are shielded from civil damages so long\r\nas their conduct \"does not violate clearly established statutory or\r\nconstitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have\r\nknown.\"  Vargas-Badillo, 114 F.3d at 5 (quoting Harlow v.\r\nFitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982)).  In evaluating the officer's\r\nconduct in question, we do not focus on the \"official's subjective\r\nstate of mind, such as bad faith or malicious intention . . . .\" \r\nFloyd v. Farrell, 765 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1985).  \"The Harlow\r\nstandard requires that we make an objective analysis of the\r\nreasonableness of conduct in light of the facts actually known to\r\nthe officer and not consider the individual officer's subjective\r\nassessment of those facts.  Nor are actual motives for conduct to\r\nbe considered in evaluating a qualified immunity defense.\"  Id. at\r\n6.   \r\nWhere an arrest is \"challenged as unsupported by \r\nprobable cause [it] is deemed 'objectively reasonable' unless\r\n'there clearly was no probable cause at the time the arrest was\r\nmade.'\" Topp v. Wolkowski, 994 F.2d 45, 48 (1st Cir. 1993) (quoting\r\nFloyd, 765 F.2d at 5).  Probable cause to arrest exists where \"the\r\nfacts and circumstances within [the police officer's] knowledge and\r\nof which [she] had reasonably trustworthy information were\r\nsufficient to warrant a prudent [person] in believing that the\r\n[arrestee] had committed or was committing an offense.\"  Rivera,\r\n979 F.2d at 263 (quoting United States v. Figueroa, 818 F.2d 1020,\r\n1023 (1st Cir. 1987)). \"Probable cause is to be determined based on\r\n'the collective knowledge and information of all the officers\r\ninvolved.'\" See United States v. Bizier, 111 F.3d 214, 217 (1st\r\nCir. 1997) (quoting United States v. Paradis, 802 F.2d 553, 557\r\n(1st Cir. 1986)).  \r\nSeveral circuits have held that \"even where there is no\r\nprobable cause to arrest the plaintiff for the crime charged, proof\r\nof probable cause to arrest the plaintiff for a related offense is\r\nalso a defense which may entitle the arresting officer to qualified\r\nimmunity.\"  Avery v. King, 110 F.3d 12, 14 (6th Cir. 1997); see\r\nKelley v. Myler, 149 F.3d 641, 647-48 (7th Cir. 1998) (\"[E]ven if\r\nprobable cause does not exist for the crime charged, proof of\r\nprobable cause to arrest the plaintiff on a closely related charge\r\nis also a defense.\"); United States v. Rambo, 789 F.2d 1289, 1294\r\n(8th Cir. 1986) (\"Where a defendant is arrested for the wrong\r\noffense, the arrest is still valid if probable cause existed to\r\narrest the defendant for a closely related offense.\").  The related\r\ncrimes defense asks \"whether the conduct that served as the basis\r\nfor the charge for which there was no probable cause could, in the\r\neyes of a similarly situated reasonable officer, also have served\r\nas the basis for a charge for which there was probable cause.\"\r\nTrejo v. Perez, 693 F.2d 482, 486 (5th Cir. 1982).  In Trejo,\r\nalthough the court agreed that the police officer did not have\r\nprobable cause to arrest the plaintiff for disorderly conduct for\r\nthe plaintiff's refusal to identify himself to the police officer,\r\nthat same conduct could have supported an arrest for violating a\r\nstatute that required a person to respond to a request for\r\nidentification.  Therefore, a jury should have been able to decide\r\nwhether a reasonable officer would have believed he had probable\r\ncause to arrest the plaintiff for a crime related to the crime\r\noffered as the justification for the arrest.  See id.\r\nOur reading of the cases suggests that \"relatedness\" has\r\ntwo requirements.  First, the crime with which the arrestee is\r\ncharged and the crime offered to the court as a justification for\r\nthe arrest must relate to the same conduct.  Second, as a corollary\r\nof this first requirement, the two crimes must share similar\r\nelements or be directed generally at prohibiting the same type of\r\nconduct.  See generally Avery, 110 F.3d at 14-15; Trejo, 693 F.2d\r\nat 485-86. These requirements prevent the \"ex post facto\r\nextrapolations of all crimes that might have been charged on a\r\ngiven set of facts at the moment of the arrest . . . .\" Richardson\r\nv. Bonds, 860 F.2d 1427, 1431 (7th Cir. 1988). The related crimes\r\ndefense, thus understood, \"allows the arresting officer to choose\r\nwhich crime she will charge without having to charge every single\r\noffense sustainable on the facts, and yet does not open the door to\r\nthe extrapolation of offenses in an effort to justify a sham\r\narrest.\" Biddle v. Martin, 992 F.2d 673, 677 (7th Cir. 1993)\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\r\nThe related crimes defense is consistent with the\r\nteachings of Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 815-19 (1982),\r\nwhich rejected an inquiry into a government official's subjective\r\nmotivations and intentions and defined the limits of qualified\r\nimmunity in objective terms.  An officer's erroneous legal\r\ndescription of the basis for an arrest should not expose the\r\nofficer to liability if another officer would have concluded that\r\nthere was probable cause to arrest for a related offense on the\r\nbasis of the same conduct.  We agree that courts should not \"make\r\nconstitutional questions turn on the term chosen by police officers\r\nto describe their activity - officers who are accustomed to the\r\nvernacular of the police station and unschooled in the accepted\r\nconstitutional vocabulary . . . .\"  Ralph v. Pepersack, 335 F.2d\r\n128, 134 (4th Cir. 1964).  Instead, we should consider whether the\r\nconduct in question would allow a reasonable officer to conclude\r\nthat probable cause existed to arrest for the related crime offered\r\nas justification.  See Biddle, 992 F.2d at 676-77 (collecting\r\ncases).  We therefore adopt the related crimes defense in this\r\ncircuit.\r\nIn the usual case involving the related crimes defense,\r\nthe crime or crimes formally charged are identical to those cited\r\nby the officer at the time of the arrest.  Thus, there is usually\r\nno need to ask whether the related crimes analysis should focus on\r\nthe conduct underlying the crime cited by the officer at the time\r\nof the arrest or, instead, the conduct underlying the crime cited\r\na short time later at the police station.  The crimes are the same. \r\nHere that question must be asked because Officer Quinn said at the\r\nscene that she was arresting Sheehy for being a disorderly person\r\nin his interaction with her, but later at the police station he was\r\nalso charged with assault and battery with a dangerous weapon\r\nbecause of his altercation with Baker.  The district court\r\nconcluded that it was appropriate to analyze the conduct underlying\r\nthe assault and battery with a dangerous weapon charge lodged at\r\nthe police station in applying the related crimes defense.  We\r\ndisagree.\r\nWhen Officer Quinn arrived at the scene, she first\r\ninterviewed Baker.  He informed Officer Quinn that Sheehy had\r\nassaulted him.  Officer Quinn then went across the street to\r\ncontinue her investigation in Sheehy's driveway.  When Sheehy\r\nrefused to cooperate, Officer Quinn arrested him for disorderly\r\nconduct on the basis of his conduct in the driveway.  The record\r\nmakes clear that Sheehy's interaction with Officer Quinn was the\r\nsole basis for the arrest.  It was only later, at the police\r\nstation, that Officer Quinn also charged Sheehy with both\r\ndisorderly conduct and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. \r\nIn other words, the additional charge at the police station had\r\nnothing to do with the conduct for which Sheehy was actually\r\narrested -- his conduct in the driveway.  The arrest charge and the\r\ncharge lodged at the police station pertained to distinct events\r\ninvolving Sheehy's conduct with different people.\r\nAlthough we are mindful that qualified immunity \"gives\r\nample room for mistaken judgments,\" Rivera, 979 F.2d at 263,\r\nOfficer Quinn did not merely give an erroneous legal description of\r\nthe conduct she was witnessing or overlook an offense applicable to\r\nthat conduct.  Instead, following the arrest, Officer Quinn relied\r\nat the police station on prior conduct of Sheehy that unmistakably\r\ndid not serve as the basis for the challenged arrest.  Allowing\r\nsuch reliance would \"open the door to the extrapolation of offenses\r\nin an effort to justify a sham arrest.\"  Biddle, 992 F.2d at 677\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted).  We will not permit it.  \r\nOur decision in Santiago v. Fenton, 891 F.2d 373 (1st\r\nCir. 1989), supports our conclusion that Officer Quinn may not\r\noffer the later charge at the police station to support her\r\nqualified immunity defense.  In Santiago, the plaintiff was engaged\r\nin a snowball fight with his friends when he hit an unmarked police\r\ncar.  The plaintiff and his friends ran off.  The officer followed\r\nthe boys briefly, but then gave up.  See id. at 377.  Later, the\r\npolice officer was in a nearby apartment complex and overheard the\r\nboys discussing the incident.  See id.  At that point, the officer\r\ngrabbed the plaintiff and an altercation ensued between the\r\nplaintiff and several officers. The plaintiff pushed the officers\r\nand made loud and obscene noises.  The officers placed the\r\nplaintiff under arrest and he was transported to the police\r\nstation, where he was charged with a misdemeanor offense of being\r\na disorderly person for allegedly shouting at the officers.  See\r\nid. at 377, 383.\r\nSantiago sued the officers pursuant to 42 U.S.C.  1983. \r\nThe officers argued that they were entitled to qualified immunity\r\nbecause, even in the absence of probable cause for the disorderly\r\nconduct charge relating to the incident in the apartment complex,\r\nthey had probable cause to arrest for the earlier snowball\r\nincident.  See id. at 383.  Although we did not discuss the related\r\ncrimes defense in Santiago, we rejected the officers' claim, noting\r\nthat the officers had unambiguously testified that the snowball\r\nincident had nothing to do with the arrest, and that the plaintiff\r\nwas arrested for striking and pushing the officers in the apartment\r\nbuilding. See id. at 383.  We would not permit the officers to\r\nvalidate the arrest retroactively based on earlier conduct that\r\nunmistakably did not serve as the basis for the challenged arrest. \r\nWe have made the same judgment in this case.\r\nIn its grant of summary judgment for Officer Quinn, the\r\ndistrict court questioned whether our analysis of qualified\r\nimmunity in Santiago v. Fenton could be reconciled with the related\r\ncrimes defense.  We see no conflict.  Contrary to the suggestion of\r\nthe district court, our reliance on the testimony of the officers\r\nabout the basis for the arrest in Santiago does not implicate the\r\nofficers' subjective motivations for arresting the plaintiff, nor\r\ndoes it condition the availability of the immunity defense on the\r\nlegal correctness of the criminal charge articulated by the\r\nofficers in describing the conduct that prompted their arrest\r\ndecision.  We used the statements of the officers in Santiago about\r\nthe basis for the arrest as objective indicators of the conduct\r\nunderlying the arrest in order to understand which of two discrete\r\nincidents prompted the arrest.  Without such an inquiry, we could\r\nnot have known which facts to consider in determining whether the\r\narrest was made pursuant to probable cause. We have used the\r\nstatements of Officer Quinn and her partner about the basis for the\r\narrest of Sheehy in the same fashion. \r\n                             III.\r\nThe district court used the assault and battery with a\r\ndangerous weapon charge, lodged at the police station, as the basis\r\nfor its conclusion that Officer Quinn had probable cause to arrest\r\nSheehy for the related offense of assault and battery.  Thus the\r\ncourt did not consider whether Officer Quinn clearly did not have\r\nprobable cause to arrest Sheehy for disorderly conduct, the stated\r\nbasis for the arrest.  Given our rejection of the court's\r\napplication of the related crimes defense to the charge lodged at\r\nthe police station, we must consider whether Officer Quinn had\r\nprobable cause to arrest Sheehy for the crime of disorderly\r\nconduct.\r\nSheehy was charged with a violation of Mass. Gen. Laws\r\nch. 272,  53, which makes it a crime to be an \"idle and disorderly\r\nperson[].\" A person is disorderly under the statute \"if, with\r\npurpose to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or\r\nrecklessly creating a risk thereof, he: (a) engages in fighting or\r\nthreatening, or in violent or tumultuous behavior . . . or (c)\r\ncreates a hazardous or physically offensive condition by any act\r\nwhich serves no legitimate purpose of the actor.\"  Commonwealth v.\r\nFeigenbaum, 536 N.E.2d 325, 327 (Mass. 1989) (quoting Alegata v.\r\nCommonwealth, 231 N.E.2d 201, 211 (Mass. 1967)).  The conduct to\r\nwhich the statute applies has been described with some specificity:\r\n  [T]he type of conduct which the disorderly\r\nperson provision of  53 reaches is that\r\nconduct which by its very nature involves the\r\nuse of physical force or violence or any\r\nthreat to use such force or violence if that\r\nthreat is objectively possible of immediate\r\nexecution.  Also covered is \"tumultuous\r\nbehavior,\" which while perhaps not physically\r\nviolent, may nevertheless be characterized as\r\ninvolving riotous commotion and excessively\r\nunreasonable noise so as to constitute a\r\npublic nuisance.  Conduct which creates a\r\ncondition of physical menace to others is also\r\nreached . . . .\r\n\nCommonwealth v. A Juvenile, 334 N.E.2d 617, 628 (Mass. 1975)\r\n(citations omitted).  That description permits no argument that a \r\nrefusal to give one's name to a police officer is disorderly\r\nconduct.\r\nWhen a defendant moves for summary judgment on qualified\r\nimmunity grounds, \"we must credit the plaintiff's version of\r\ndefendants' actions to the extent that plaintiff has appropriately\r\nsupported his version.\"  Amsden v. Moran, 904 F.2d 748, 752-53 (1st\r\nCir. 1990).  In Sheehy's deposition he explained that Officer Quinn\r\nasked him his name, but he refused to tell her since he had already\r\ngiven another officer the information.  He testified that she once\r\nagain demanded that Sheehy provide her with his name or she would\r\nplace him under arrest.  Sheehy refused and put out his hands.\r\nOfficer Quinn arrested him.  On Sheehy's version of the facts, he\r\ndemonstrated no conduct that could be considered \"disorderly\"   he\r\ndid not act with or threaten force or violence, his behavior was\r\nnot \"tumultuous,\" and he did not create a physical menace to\r\nothers.\r\nTherefore, on the basis of this record, Officer Quinn\r\nshould not have been granted summary judgment.  If a jury were to\r\nbelieve Sheehy's version of events, it reasonably could find that\r\nOfficer Quinn clearly did not have probable cause to arrest him for\r\ndisorderly conduct.  According to Officer Quinn, however, Sheehy\r\nnot only refused to give his name, but also paced around in an\r\nagitated fashion when she tried to talk to him, displayed\r\naggressive body language, and advanced toward her \"in a very\r\nthreatening manner.\" A jury believing that version of the facts\r\ncould reasonably conclude that it was not clear that Officer Quinn\r\nlacked probable cause to arrest Sheehy for disorderly conduct.  We\r\nmust therefore vacate the judgment of the district court and\r\nremand.\r\nJudgment vacated.  Remanded for further proceedings.\n",

Sheehy informed the sergeant that he would not be filing a complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officer Quinn then arrived at the scene. She first went to Baker's house where Baker told her that Sheehy had assaulted and kicked him. Officer Quinn had been to Baker's house before to investigate disturbances, and had always found him to be truthful. Although she could smell alcohol on his breath, she did not think he was drunk. Officer Quinn then went across the street to Sheehy's driveway where Sheehy was washing his boat. There were four bystanders in the driveway, and one of them was shouting and visibly upset. Officer Quinn attempted to question Sheehy, but he refused to respond, telling Officer Quinn that he had already given his name and address to the sergeant. She told him that \"I'm the investigating officer now, and I am not going to put up with this . . . you know, either you give me identification or I arrest you.\" Sheehy put his hands out and said, \"Then just arrest me.\" Officer Quinn said, \"You're under arrest.\" Sheehy asked what he was being arrested for and Officer Quinn responded: \"For not giving me your name.\" Sheehy, a retired state trooper, told her she did not have the authority to arrest him for failure to provide his name. Officer Quinn's partner then told Sheehy that he was being arrested for being a disorderly person. Sheehy asked how he could be a disorderly person in his own yard and added, \"What constitutes being disorderly, I haven't opened my mouth.\" Officer Quinn's partner responded, \"Failure to give your name.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sheehy was handcuffed and taken to the police station where he was charged with assault and battery with a dangerous weapon<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and being a disorderly person. Sheehy pled not guilty at his arraignment. At a pretrial conference, the district attorney refused to prosecute and the charges were dismissed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sheehy then filed suit in Massachusetts state court against Officer Quinn and the town of Plymouth, pursuant inter alia to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, alleging that his arrest was in violation of the Fourth Amendment because Officer Quinn did not have probable cause to arrest him for disorderly conduct or assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. The case was subsequently removed to the federal district court for the District of Massachusetts. After removal, Officer Quinn filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming that she was entitled to qualified immunity. The district court agreed, adopting the related crimes defense. The district court concluded that Officer Quinn had probable cause to arrest Sheehy for simple assault and battery, and further concluded that assault and battery and the crime charged at the police station (i.e., assault and battery with a dangerous weapon) were clearly related. The district court entered a summary judgment against Sheehy on his one federal claim under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and remanded the remaining state law claims for disposition in the state court. Sheehy now appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's entry of summary judgment is reviewed de novo. See Vargas-Badillo v. Diaz-Torres, 114 F.3d 3, 5 (1st Cir. 1997). We consider whether \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). We review the record in a light most favorable to the party opposing the summary judgment and we will indulge in all reasonable inferences in that party's favor. See Rivera v. Murphy, 979 F.2d 259, 261 (1st Cir. 1992). Where there is no dispute over the underlying material facts, \"a defendant's entitlement to qualified immunity is a question of law and is reserved for plenary review by this court.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally, government officials performing discretionary functions (such as arrests) are shielded from civil damages so long as their conduct \"does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\" Vargas-Badillo, 114 F.3d at 5 (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982)). In evaluating the officer's conduct in question, we do not focus on the \"official's subjective state of mind, such as bad faith or malicious intention . . . .\" Floyd v. Farrell, 765 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1985). \"The Harlow standard requires that we make an objective analysis of the reasonableness of conduct in light of the facts actually known to the officer and not consider the individual officer's subjective assessment of those facts. Nor are actual motives for conduct to be considered in evaluating a qualified immunity defense.\" Id. at 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where an arrest is \"challenged as unsupported by probable cause [it] is deemed 'objectively reasonable' unless 'there clearly was no probable cause at the time the arrest was made.'\" Topp v. Wolkowski, 994 F.2d 45, 48 (1st Cir. 1993) (quoting Floyd, 765 F.2d at 5). Probable cause to arrest exists where \"the facts and circumstances within [the police officer's] knowledge and of which [she] had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent [person] in believing that the [arrestee] had committed or was committing an offense.\" Rivera, 979 F.2d at 263 (quoting United States v. Figueroa, 818 F.2d 1020, 1023 (1st Cir. 1987)). \"Probable cause is to be determined based on 'the collective knowledge and information of all the officers involved.'\" See United States v. Bizier, 111 F.3d 214, 217 (1st Cir. 1997) (quoting United States v. Paradis, 802 F.2d 553, 557 (1st Cir. 1986)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several circuits have held that \"even where there is no probable cause to arrest the plaintiff for the crime charged, proof of probable cause to arrest the plaintiff for a related offense is also a defense which may entitle the arresting officer to qualified immunity.\" Avery v. King, 110 F.3d 12, 14 (6th Cir. 1997); see Kelley v. Myler, 149 F.3d 641, 647-48 (7th Cir. 1998) (\"[E]ven if probable cause does not exist for the crime charged, proof of probable cause to arrest the plaintiff on a closely related charge is also a defense.\"); United States v. Rambo, 789 F.2d 1289, 1294 (8th Cir. 1986) (\"Where a defendant is arrested for the wrong offense, the arrest is still valid if probable cause existed to arrest the defendant for a closely related offense.\"). The related crimes defense asks \"whether the conduct that served as the basis for the charge for which there was no probable cause could, in the eyes of a similarly situated reasonable officer, also have served as the basis for a charge for which there was probable cause.\" Trejo v. Perez, 693 F.2d 482, 486 (5th Cir. 1982). In Trejo, although the court agreed that the police officer did not have probable cause to arrest the plaintiff for disorderly conduct for the plaintiff's refusal to identify himself to the police officer, that same conduct could have supported an arrest for violating a statute that required a person to respond to a request for identification. Therefore, a jury should have been able to decide whether a reasonable officer would have believed he had probable cause to arrest the plaintiff for a crime related to the crime offered as the justification for the arrest. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our reading of the cases suggests that \"relatedness\" has two requirements. First, the crime with which the arrestee is charged and the crime offered to the court as a justification for the arrest must relate to the same conduct. Second, as a corollary of this first requirement, the two crimes must share similar elements or be directed generally at prohibiting the same type of conduct. See generally Avery, 110 F.3d at 14-15; Trejo, 693 F.2d at 485-86. These requirements prevent the \"ex post facto extrapolations of all crimes that might have been charged on a given set of facts at the moment of the arrest . . . .\" Richardson v. Bonds, 860 F.2d 1427, 1431 (7th Cir. 1988). The related crimes defense, thus understood, \"allows the arresting officer to choose which crime she will charge without having to charge every single offense sustainable on the facts, and yet does not open the door to the extrapolation of offenses in an effort to justify a sham arrest.\" Biddle v. Martin, 992 F.2d 673, 677 (7th Cir. 1993) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The related crimes defense is consistent with the teachings of Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 815-19 (1982), which rejected an inquiry into a government official's subjective motivations and intentions and defined the limits of qualified immunity in objective terms. An officer's erroneous legal description of the basis for an arrest should not expose the officer to liability if another officer would have concluded that there was probable cause to arrest for a related offense on the basis of the same conduct. We agree that courts should not \"make constitutional questions turn on the term chosen by police officers to describe their activity - officers who are accustomed to the vernacular of the police station and unschooled in the accepted constitutional vocabulary . . . .\" Ralph v. Pepersack, 335 F.2d 128, 134 (4th Cir. 1964). Instead, we should consider whether the conduct in question would allow a reasonable officer to conclude that probable cause existed to arrest for the related crime offered as justification. See Biddle, 992 F.2d at 676-77 (collecting cases). We therefore adopt the related crimes defense in this circuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the usual case involving the related crimes defense, the crime or crimes formally charged are identical to those cited by the officer at the time of the arrest. Thus, there is usually no need to ask whether the related crimes analysis should focus on the conduct underlying the crime cited by the officer at the time of the arrest or, instead, the conduct underlying the crime cited a short time later at the police station. The crimes are the same. Here that question must be asked because Officer Quinn said at the scene that she was arresting Sheehy for being a disorderly person in his interaction with her, but later at the police station he was also charged with assault and battery with a dangerous weapon because of his altercation with Baker. The district court concluded that it was appropriate to analyze the conduct underlying the assault and battery with a dangerous weapon charge lodged at the police station in applying the related crimes defense. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Officer Quinn arrived at the scene, she first interviewed Baker. He informed Officer Quinn that Sheehy had assaulted him. Officer Quinn then went across the street to continue her investigation in Sheehy's driveway. When Sheehy refused to cooperate, Officer Quinn arrested him for disorderly conduct on the basis of his conduct in the driveway. The record makes clear that Sheehy's interaction with Officer Quinn was the sole basis for the arrest. It was only later, at the police station, that Officer Quinn also charged Sheehy with both disorderly conduct and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. In other words, the additional charge at the police station had nothing to do with the conduct for which Sheehy was actually arrested -- his conduct in the driveway. The arrest charge and the charge lodged at the police station pertained to distinct events involving Sheehy's conduct with different people.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we are mindful that qualified immunity \"gives ample room for mistaken judgments,\" Rivera, 979 F.2d at 263, Officer Quinn did not merely give an erroneous legal description of the conduct she was witnessing or overlook an offense applicable to that conduct. Instead, following the arrest, Officer Quinn relied at the police station on prior conduct of Sheehy that unmistakably did not serve as the basis for the challenged arrest. Allowing such reliance would \"open the door to the extrapolation of offenses in an effort to justify a sham arrest.\" Biddle, 992 F.2d at 677 (internal quotation marks omitted). We will not permit it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our decision in Santiago v. Fenton, 891 F.2d 373 (1st Cir. 1989), supports our conclusion that Officer Quinn may not offer the later charge at the police station to support her qualified immunity defense. In Santiago, the plaintiff was engaged in a snowball fight with his friends when he hit an unmarked police car. The plaintiff and his friends ran off. The officer followed the boys briefly, but then gave up. See id. at 377. Later, the police officer was in a nearby apartment complex and overheard the boys discussing the incident.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> See id. At that point, the officer grabbed the plaintiff and an altercation ensued between the plaintiff and several officers. The plaintiff pushed the officers and made loud and obscene noises. The officers placed the plaintiff under arrest and he was transported to the police station, where he was charged with a misdemeanor offense of being a disorderly person for allegedly shouting at the officers. See id. at 377, 383.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago sued the officers pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983. The officers argued that they were entitled to qualified immunity because, even in the absence of probable cause for the disorderly conduct charge relating to the incident in the apartment complex, they had probable cause to arrest for the earlier snowball incident. See id. at 383. Although we did not discuss the related crimes defense in Santiago, we rejected the officers' claim, noting that the officers had unambiguously testified that the snowball incident had nothing to do with the arrest, and that the plaintiff was arrested for striking and pushing the officers in the apartment building. See id. at 383. We would not permit the officers to validate the arrest retroactively based on earlier conduct that unmistakably did not serve as the basis for the challenged arrest. We have made the same judgment in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its grant of summary judgment for Officer Quinn, the district court questioned whether our analysis of qualified immunity in Santiago v. Fenton could be reconciled with the related crimes defense. We see no conflict. Contrary to the suggestion of the district court, our reliance on the testimony of the officers about the basis for the arrest in Santiago does not implicate the officers' subjective motivations for arresting the plaintiff, nor does it condition the availability of the immunity defense on the legal correctness of the criminal charge articulated by the officers in describing the conduct that prompted their arrest decision. We used the statements of the officers in Santiago about the basis for the arrest as objective indicators of the conduct underlying the arrest in order to understand which of two discrete incidents prompted the arrest. Without such an inquiry, we could not have known which facts to consider in determining whether the arrest was made pursuant to probable cause. We have used the statements of Officer Quinn and her partner about the basis for the arrest of Sheehy in the same fashion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court used the assault and battery with a dangerous weapon charge, lodged at the police station, as the basis for its conclusion that Officer Quinn had probable cause to arrest Sheehy for the related offense of assault and battery. Thus the court did not consider whether Officer Quinn clearly did not have probable cause to arrest Sheehy for disorderly conduct, the stated basis for the arrest. Given our rejection of the court's application of the related crimes defense to the charge lodged at the police station, we must consider whether Officer Quinn had probable cause to arrest Sheehy for the crime of disorderly conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sheehy was charged with a violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 272, &#167; 53, which makes it a crime to be an \"idle and disorderly person[].\" A person is disorderly under the statute \"if, with purpose to cause public<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, he: (a) engages in fighting or threatening, or in violent or tumultuous behavior . . . or (c) creates a hazardous or physically offensive condition by any act which serves no legitimate purpose of the actor.\" Commonwealth v. Feigenbaum, 536 N.E.2d 325, 327 (Mass. 1989) (quoting Alegata v. Commonwealth, 231 N.E.2d 201, 211 (Mass. 1967)). The conduct to which the statute applies has been described with some specificity:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he type of conduct which the disorderly person provision of &#167; 53 reaches is that conduct which by its very nature involves the use of physical force or violence or any threat to use such force or violence if that threat is objectively possible of immediate execution.

Conduct which creates a condition of physical menace to others is also reached . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Commonwealth v. A Juvenile, 334 N.E.2d 617, 628 (Mass. 1975) (citations omitted). That description permits no argument that a refusal to give one's name to a police officer is disorderly conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a defendant moves for summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds, \"we must credit the plaintiff's version of defendants' actions to the extent that plaintiff has appropriately supported his version.\" Amsden v. Moran, 904 F.2d 748, 752-53 (1st Cir. 1990). In Sheehy's deposition he explained that Officer Quinn asked him his name, but he refused to tell her since he had already given another officer the information. He testified that she once again demanded that Sheehy provide her with his name or she would place him under arrest. Sheehy refused and put out his hands. Officer Quinn arrested him. On Sheehy's version of the facts, he demonstrated no conduct that could be considered \"disorderly\" -- he did not act with or threaten force or violence, his behavior was not \"tumultuous,\" and he did not create a physical menace to others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, on the basis of this record, Officer Quinn should not have been granted summary judgment. If a jury were to believe Sheehy's version of events, it reasonably could find that Officer Quinn clearly did not have probable cause to arrest him for disorderly conduct. According to Officer Quinn, however, Sheehy not only refused to give his name, but also paced around in an agitated fashion when she tried to talk to him, displayed aggressive body language, and advanced toward her \"in a very threatening manner.\" A jury believing that version of the facts could reasonably conclude that it was not clear that Officer Quinn lacked probable cause to arrest Sheehy for disorderly conduct.

See Gassner v. City of Portland, 864 F.2d 394 (5th Cir. 1982). The plaintiff Gassner, who was driving erratically because he was searching for his lost child, was pulled over by a police officer. In his agitated state, Gassner refused to cooperate with the officer, who arrested him on the stated basis that he was speeding. At the police station, the plaintiff was charged with both disorderly conduct and speeding. See id. at 396. The court concluded that summary judgment should have been entered for the police officer on his qualified immunity defense on the ground that he had probable cause to arrest for an offense related to the disorderly conduct charge -- namely, failing to comply with the order of a police officer. In relating the disorderly conduct charge to the failure to comply with a police order, the court did not mention the difference between the original basis for arrest (speeding) and the crime charged at the police station. We think that difference is significant in this case, and we will not overlook it.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> It is not clear exactly how much time elapsed between the snowball incident and the incident in the apartment building.

The district court adopted the related crimes defense and granted summary judgment for the defendant police officer. Although we conclude that a police officer is entitled to invoke the related crimes defense, we must vacate the district court's entry of summary judgment. There exists a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the defendant police officer, Rita Quinn, clearly did not have probable cause to arrest plaintiff Richard Sheehy for disorderly conduct, the crime cited by the officer as the basis for the arrest at the scene.

Officer Quinn had been to Baker's house before to investigate disturbances, and had always found him to be truthful. Although she could smell alcohol on his breath, she did not think he was drunk. Officer Quinn then went across the street to Sheehy's driveway where Sheehy was washing his boat. There were four bystanders in the driveway, and one of them was shouting and visibly upset. Officer Quinn attempted to question Sheehy, but he refused to respond, telling Officer Quinn that he had already given his name and address to the sergeant. She told him that \"I'm the investigating officer now, and I am not going to put up with this . . . you know, either you give me identification or I arrest you.\" Sheehy put his hands out and said, \"Then just arrest me.\" Officer Quinn said, \"You're under arrest.\" Sheehy asked what he was being arrested for and Officer Quinn responded: \"For not giving me your name.\" Sheehy, a retired state trooper, told her she did not have the authority to arrest him for failure to provide his name. Officer Quinn's partner then told Sheehy that he was being arrested for being a disorderly person. Sheehy asked how he could be a disorderly person in his own yard and added, \"What constitutes being disorderly, I haven't opened my mouth.\" Officer Quinn's partner responded, \"Failure to give your name.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sheehy was handcuffed and taken to the police station where he was charged with assault and battery with a dangerous weapon<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and being a disorderly person.

The case was subsequently removed to the federal district court for the District of Massachusetts. After removal, Officer Quinn filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming that she was entitled to qualified immunity. The district court agreed, adopting the related crimes defense. The district court concluded that Officer Quinn had probable cause to arrest Sheehy for simple assault and battery, and further concluded that assault and battery and the crime charged at the police station (i.e., assault and battery with a dangerous weapon) were clearly related. The district court entered a summary judgment against Sheehy on his one federal claim under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and remanded the remaining state law claims for disposition in the state court.

The related crimes defense asks \"whether the conduct that served as the basis for the charge for which there was no probable cause could, in the eyes of a similarly situated reasonable officer, also have served as the basis for a charge for which there was probable cause.\" Trejo v.

In Trejo, although the court agreed that the police officer did not have probable cause to arrest the plaintiff for disorderly conduct for the plaintiff's refusal to identify himself to the police officer, that same conduct could have supported an arrest for violating a statute that required a person to respond to a request for identification. Therefore, a jury should have been able to decide whether a reasonable officer would have believed he had probable cause to arrest the plaintiff for a crime related to the crime offered as the justification for the arrest. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our reading of the cases suggests that \"relatedness\" has two requirements. First, the crime with which the arrestee is charged and the crime offered to the court as a justification for the arrest must relate to the same conduct. Second, as a corollary of this first requirement, the two crimes must share similar elements or be directed generally at prohibiting the same type of conduct. See generally Avery, 110 F.3d at 14-15; Trejo, 693 F.2d at 485-86. These requirements prevent the \"ex post facto extrapolations of all crimes that might have been charged on a given set of facts at the moment of the arrest . . . .\" Richardson v.

The related crimes defense, thus understood, \"allows the arresting officer to choose which crime she will charge without having to charge every single offense sustainable on the facts, and yet does not open the door to the extrapolation of offenses in an effort to justify a sham arrest.\" Biddle v.

An officer's erroneous legal description of the basis for an arrest should not expose the officer to liability if another officer would have concluded that there was probable cause to arrest for a related offense on the basis of the same conduct. We agree that courts should not \"make constitutional questions turn on the term chosen by police officers to describe their activity - officers who are accustomed to the vernacular of the police station and unschooled in the accepted constitutional vocabulary . . . .\" Ralph v. Pepersack, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"265152\"><a href=\"/opinion/265152/william-ralph-v-vernon-l-pepersack-warden-maryland-state-penitentiary/\"><span class=\"volume\">335</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></a></span>, 134 (4th Cir. 1964). Instead, we should consider whether the conduct in question would allow a reasonable officer to conclude that probable cause existed to arrest for the related crime offered as justification. See Biddle, 992 F.2d at 676-77 (collecting cases). We therefore adopt the related crimes defense in this circuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the usual case involving the related crimes defense, the crime or crimes formally charged are identical to those cited by the officer at the time of the arrest. Thus, there is usually no need to ask whether the related crimes analysis should focus on the conduct underlying the crime cited by the officer at the time of the arrest or, instead, the conduct underlying the crime cited a short time later at the police station. The crimes are the same. Here that question must be asked because Officer Quinn said at the scene that she was arresting Sheehy for being a disorderly person in his interaction with her, but later at the police station he was also charged with assault and battery with a dangerous weapon because of his altercation with Baker. The district court concluded that it was appropriate to analyze the conduct underlying the assault and battery with a dangerous weapon charge lodged at the police station in applying the related crimes defense. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Officer Quinn arrived at the scene, she first interviewed Baker. He informed Officer Quinn that Sheehy had assaulted him. Officer Quinn then went across the street to continue her investigation in Sheehy's driveway. When Sheehy refused to cooperate, Officer Quinn arrested him for disorderly conduct on the basis of his conduct in the driveway. The record makes clear that Sheehy's interaction with Officer Quinn was the sole basis for the arrest. It was only later, at the police station, that Officer Quinn also charged Sheehy with both disorderly conduct and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. In other words, the additional charge at the police station had nothing to do with the conduct for which Sheehy was actually arrested -- his conduct in the driveway. The arrest charge and the charge lodged at the police station pertained to distinct events involving Sheehy's conduct with different people.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we are mindful that qualified immunity \"gives ample room for mistaken judgments,\" Rivera, 979 F.2d at 263, Officer Quinn did not merely give an erroneous legal description of the conduct she was witnessing or overlook an offense applicable to that conduct. Instead, following the arrest, Officer Quinn relied at the police station on prior conduct of Sheehy that unmistakably did not serve as the basis for the challenged arrest. Allowing such reliance would \"open the door to the extrapolation of offenses in an effort to justify a sham arrest.\" Biddle, 992 F.2d at 677 (internal quotation marks omitted).

In Santiago, the plaintiff was engaged in a snowball fight with his friends when he hit an unmarked police car. The plaintiff and his friends ran off. The officer followed the boys briefly, but then gave up. See id. at 377. Later, the police officer was in a nearby apartment complex and overheard the boys discussing the incident.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> See id. At that point, the officer grabbed the plaintiff and an altercation ensued between the plaintiff and several officers. The plaintiff pushed the officers and made loud and obscene noises. The officers placed the plaintiff under arrest and he was transported to the police station, where he was charged with a misdemeanor offense of being a disorderly person for allegedly shouting at the officers. See id. at 377, 383.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Santiago sued the officers pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983. The officers argued that they were entitled to qualified immunity because, even in the absence of probable cause for the disorderly conduct charge relating to the incident in the apartment complex, they had probable cause to arrest for the earlier snowball incident. See id. at 383. Although we did not discuss the related crimes defense in Santiago, we rejected the officers' claim, noting that the officers had unambiguously testified that the snowball incident had nothing to do with the arrest, and that the plaintiff was arrested for striking and pushing the officers in the apartment building. See id. at 383. We would not permit the officers to validate the arrest retroactively based on earlier conduct that unmistakably did not serve as the basis for the challenged arrest. We have made the same judgment in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its grant of summary judgment for Officer Quinn, the district court questioned whether our analysis of qualified immunity in Santiago v. Fenton could be reconciled with the related crimes defense. We see no conflict. Contrary to the suggestion of the district court, our reliance on the testimony of the officers about the basis for the arrest in Santiago does not implicate the officers' subjective motivations for arresting the plaintiff, nor does it condition the availability of the immunity defense on the legal correctness of the criminal charge articulated by the officers in describing the conduct that prompted their arrest decision. We used the statements of the officers in Santiago about the basis for the arrest as objective indicators of the conduct underlying the arrest in order to understand which of two discrete incidents prompted the arrest. Without such an inquiry, we could not have known which facts to consider in determining whether the arrest was made pursuant to probable cause. We have used the statements of Officer Quinn and her partner about the basis for the arrest of Sheehy in the same fashion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court used the assault and battery with a dangerous weapon charge, lodged at the police station, as the basis for its conclusion that Officer Quinn had probable cause to arrest Sheehy for the related offense of assault and battery. Thus the court did not consider whether Officer Quinn clearly did not have probable cause to arrest Sheehy for disorderly conduct, the stated basis for the arrest. Given our rejection of the court's application of the related crimes defense to the charge lodged at the police station, we must consider whether Officer Quinn had probable cause to arrest Sheehy for the crime of disorderly conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sheehy was charged with a violation of Mass.

In Sheehy's deposition he explained that Officer Quinn asked him his name, but he refused to tell her since he had already given another officer the information. He testified that she once again demanded that Sheehy provide her with his name or she would place him under arrest. Sheehy refused and put out his hands. Officer Quinn arrested him.

The plaintiff Gassner, who was driving erratically because he was searching for his lost child, was pulled over by a police officer.

At the police station, the plaintiff was charged with both disorderly conduct and speeding. See id. at 396. The court concluded that summary judgment should have been entered for the police officer on his qualified immunity defense on the ground that he had probable cause to arrest for an offense related to the disorderly conduct charge -- namely, failing to comply with the order of a police officer. In relating the disorderly conduct charge to the failure to comply with a police order, the court did not mention the difference between the original basis for arrest (speeding) and the crime charged at the police station. We think that difference is significant in this case, and we will not overlook it.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> It is not clear exactly how much time elapsed between the snowball incident and the incident in the apartment building.
