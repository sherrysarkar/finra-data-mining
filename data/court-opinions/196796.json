The  BIA  upheld  an  Immigration Judge's  ruling  that\r\n\npetitioner  was   ineligible,  either  for  asylum   or  for  the\r\n\nwithholding  of  deportation,  since  his  asserted  fears   were\r\n\npredicated on possible prosecution, not persecution.  \r\n\n          A motion to reopen seeks permissive relief,  see id. at\r                                                                       \r\n\n361,  which  may  be  denied  solely  because  it  introduces  no\r\n\n\"'previously unavailable, material evidence . . . .'\"  Id. at 360\r                                                                    \r\n\n(quoting Doherty,  502 U.S. at 323),  as was the case  here.  The\r                          \r\n\nmotion  to reopen  alleged that  petitioner would  be exposed  to\r\n\nimprisonment  or death for having  jumped ship.   It claimed that\r\n\nthe situation had been worsened by a more restrictive immigration\r\n\npolicy  announced on  May  2, 1995,  pertaining  to future  Cuban\r\n\n\"rafters.\"    The BIA  concluded  that petitioner  had  failed to\r\n\ndemonstrate  that the  motion  to reopen  was  based on  any  new\r\n\nevidence,  the immigration  policy on  \"rafters\" notwithstanding.\r\n\nWe agree.  \r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\n          Petitioner  has not  shown,  either before  the BIA  or\r\n\nhere, that the new immigration policy was material to his request\r                                                            \r\n\nfor  asylum  or  withholding  deportation.    At  most,  the  new\r\n\nimmigration  policy allegedly  exacerbated petitioner's  fears of\r\n\n\"prosecution\" for having jumped ship  in violation of Cuban  law,\r\n\nas  distinguished from  a legitimate  fear of \"persecution.\"   As\r\n\nthere was  no error in the  BIA determination that  the claim for\r\n\nasylum was unfounded because an \"alien's prosecution and possible\r\n\nimprisonment for civil or criminal  violations pursuant to law do\r\n\nnot constitute  persecution,\" there  can  have been  no abuse  of\r\n\ndiscretion.
