Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                        Before\r\n\n                 Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n            Cudahy,* Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n              and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\nJ. Martin Richey, by appointment of Court, for appellant.\r\nChristopher F. Bator, Assistant United States Attorney, with\r\nwhom Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, was on brief for\r\nappellee.\r\n\nMarch 19, 1999\r\n\n                \r\n*Of the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation.\r\n\nSTAHL, Circuit Judge.  On January 22, 1998, defendant-\r\nappellant Ramon Dueno pleaded guilty to each count of a three-count\r\nindictment charging him with being a felon in possession of a\r\nfirearm, see 18 U.S.C.  922(g); possessing an unregistered\r\nfirearm, see 26 U.S.C.  5861(d) &amp; 5871; and transferring a\r\nfirearm without having met the requirements of 26 U.S.C.  5812,\r\nsee 26 U.S.C.  5861(e), 5871, and 5812.  The charges to which\r\nDueno pleaded arose from his March 14, 1997 sale of a sawed-off\r\nshotgun to an undercover police officer.  At the time of the sale,\r\nDueno had a number of prior criminal convictions, including a 1991\r\nMassachusetts conviction for assault and battery, and a 1994\r\nMassachusetts conviction following a guilty plea to a charged\r\nviolation of a statute proscribing, \"in the night time, break[ing]\r\nand enter[ing] a building, ship, vessel, or vehicle, with intent to\r\ncommit a felony.\"  Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 266,  16.  \r\nAt sentencing, both sides agreed that the 1991 assault\r\nand battery conviction is a \"crime of violence\" within the meaning\r\nof the career offender provisions of the federal sentencing\r\nguidelines.  See U.S.S.G.  4B1.2.  But they disagreed as to\r\nwhether the 1994 breaking and entering conviction should be so\r\nregarded.  The dispute mattered because the charges to which Dueno\r\npleaded in this case trigger the more draconian sentencing\r\nprovisions of the career offender guideline,  see United States v.\r\nFortes, 141 F.3d 1, 6-8 (1st Cir.) (possession of a sawed-off\r\nshotgun is a \"violent felony\" within the meaning of the Armed\r\nCareer Criminal Act (\"ACCA\")), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 2387\r\n(1998), and United States v. Winter, 22 F.3d 15, 18 n.3 (1st Cir.\r\n1994) (authority interpreting the ACCA's \"violent felony\" provision\r\nis frequently persuasive in interpreting the guidelines' \"crime of\r\nviolence\" provision, and vice versa), and because Dueno is a career\r\noffender if, but only if, his 1994 breaking and entering conviction\r\nis a crime of violence, see U.S.S.G.  4B1.1 (defining career\r\noffender as one who, inter alia, has \"two prior felony convictions\r\nof either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense\")\r\n(emphasis supplied).  Furthermore, Dueno is subject to an enhanced\r\nsentence under the firearms guideline if found to be a career\r\noffender.  See U.S.S.G.  2K2.1(a)(1) (prescribing an enhanced\r\nsentence for a career offender who engages in a firearm offense\r\nwith a firearm described in 26 U.S.C.  5845(a), which describes\r\nsawed-off shotguns).  For reasons explained below, the district\r\ncourt concluded that the 1994 breaking and entering conviction was\r\na crime of violence and sentenced Dueno accordingly.\r\nThe breaking and entering statute under which Dueno\r\npleaded guilty encompasses conduct that constitutes a crime of\r\nviolence (i.e., breaking into and entering a person's home, seeU.S.S.G.  4B1.2(a)(2) (\"burglary of a dwelling\" is a crime of\r\nviolence)), and conduct that almost certainly does not (i.e.,\r\nbreaking into and entering a vehicle, see infra at 6-7 (rejecting\r\nthe government's suggestion that we affirm by ruling that all of\r\nthe conduct described by the statute is violent); cf. United Statesv. Harris, 964 F.2d 1234, 1236 (1st Cir. 1992) (assuming in dictathat breaking into and entering a vehicle is not a violent felony\r\nunder the ACCA)).  When faced with a prior conviction under such a\r\nstatute, a federal sentencing court may not hold a mini-trial on\r\nthe particular facts underlying the prior offense in an effort to\r\ndetermine whether the defendant's conduct was violent.  See, e.g.,\r\nUnited States v. Damon, 127 F.3d 139, 144 (1st Cir. 1997); United\r\nStates v. Meader, 118 F.3d 876, 882 (1st Cir. 1997), cert. denied,\r\n118 S. Ct. 729 (1998); cf. United States v. Taylor, 495 U.S. 575,\r\n599-602 (1990) (ACCA case).  But it may \"peek beneath the coverlet\"\r\nof the language of the prior judgment to ascertain whether the\r\nconviction was for a violent or a non-violent crime.  Winter, 22\r\nF.3d at 18.  Ordinarily, this \"peek\" should be limited to an\r\nexamination of the indictment, complaint, and/or jury instructions\r\nin the prior case.  See Damon, 127 F.3d at 144-45; cf. Taylor, 495\r\nU.S. at 602; Harris, 964 F.2d at 1235-37.  But where, as apparently\r\nwas the case here, the charging papers simply used the boilerplate\r\nstatutory formulation and there are no jury instructions (because\r\nof the guilty plea), we have found it \r\nappropriate for the sentencing court to look\r\nto the conduct in respect to which the\r\ndefendant was charged and pled guilty, notbecause the court may properly be interested\r\n(in this context) in the violent or non-\r\nviolent nature of that particular conduct, but\r\nbecause that conduct may indicate that the\r\ndefendant and the government both believed\r\nthat the generically violent crime . . .\r\nrather than the generically non-violent crime\r\n. . . was at issue.\r\n\nHarris, 964 F.2d at 1236.\r\nIn this case, the government successfully argued at\r\nsentencing that, notwithstanding the generic nature of the breaking\r\nand entering charge set forth in the 1994 state court complaint, a\r\nfair reading of the complaint as a whole establishes that Dueno\r\nbroke into and entered a building, and thus committed a crime of\r\nviolence.  The government based its argument on a second charge in\r\nthe same complaint, which apparently alleged that Dueno \"willingly\r\nand maliciously destroy[ed] or injur[ed] the personal property,\r\ndwelling, house or building of [the victim], the value of the\r\nproperty so destroyed or injured exceeding two hundred and fifty\r\ndollars, in violation of [Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 266,  127].\" \r\nThe government now correctly concedes that its prior argument, and\r\nthe district court's acceptance of the argument, are not\r\nsustainable; even if it could be inferred that both charges in the\r\ncomplaint arose from essentially the same course of criminal\r\nconduct, the complaint can as readily be taken to describe an\r\nunlawful entry into a vehicle, followed by vandalism in the vehicle\r\ncausing more than $250 worth of damage, as it can be taken to\r\ndescribe a building invasion.  We therefore cannot affirm the\r\ndetermination that Dueno is a career offender under the reasoning\r\nof the district court.\r\nThe government argues that, despite this error, we can\r\naffirm Dueno's sentence on one of two proffered alternative\r\ngrounds.  First, the government asks us to rule that breaking into\r\nand entering any of the three non-buildings specified in Mass. Gen.\r\nLaws Ann. ch. 266,  16   a ship, vessel, or vehicle   is a crime\r\nof violence under U.S.S.G.  4B1.2(a)'s \"otherwise\" clause.  Seeid. (defining crime of violence as one that is punishable by\r\nimprisonment for a term exceeding one year and (1) \"has as an\r\nelement the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\r\nagainst the person of another\"; (2) \"is burglary of a dwelling,\r\narson, . . . extortion, [or] involves use of explosives\"; or (3)\r\n\"otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential riskof physical injury to another.\") (emphasis supplied).  Accepting\r\nthis argument, which the government first advanced in the last two\r\nparagraphs of its appellate brief, would entail our becoming the\r\nfirst federal court of appeals to rule that breaking into and\r\nentering a vehicle is a crime of violence.  We are loath to issue\r\nso significant a ruling where Dueno had insufficient opportunity to\r\ndevelop a factual rebuttal (e.g., the introduction of relevant\r\ncrime statistics and/or expert testimony) in the lower court.\r\nMoreover, we think it potentially important that the case\r\non which the government entirely relies in pressing this argument,\r\nsee United States v. Patterson, 882 F.2d 595, 601-04 (1st Cir. 1989)\r\n(breaking and entering a building, ship, or vessel, and entering\r\nwithout breaking a dwelling house at night, are violent felonies\r\nwithin the meaning of the ACCA), involves an interpretation of the\r\n\"violent felony\" provisions of the ACCA, whereas this case involves\r\nan interpretation of the career offender guidelines' \"crime of\r\nviolence\" provisions.  While there is far more overlap than\r\ndifference between the two, see Winter, 22 F.3d at 18 n.3, at least\r\none federal appeals court has read the guidelines and the\r\nguidelines commentary differently than it does the ACCA with\r\nrespect to whether breaking and entering non-dwellings are crimes\r\nof violence, see United States v. Smith, 10 F.3d 724, 731-33 (10thCir. 1993) (per curiam)(holding that the unlawful entry of a non-\r\ndwelling building is not a crime of violence under the \"otherwise\"\r\nclause).  We need not endorse the Smith panel's conclusion about\r\nthe unlawful entry of a non-dwelling building, see United States v.\r\nSawyer, 144 F.3d 191, 196 (1st Cir. 1998) (declining to follow Smith \r\nbecause of our previous holding that breaking into and entering a\r\ncommercial structure was a crime of violence under the guidelines,\r\nciting United States v. Fiore, 983 F.2d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1992)), to\r\nrecognize that the reasoning underlying the conclusion deserves\r\ncareful consideration before we decide that breaking into and\r\nentering a vehicle constitutes a crime of violence.  And we are not\r\ninclined to engage in such consideration where, as here, there has\r\nbeen no argument on the issue by the parties.  \r\n\nThe second proffered basis for affirming Dueno's sentence\r\non alternative grounds presents a more difficult question. The\r\ngovernment points out that the Presentence Report in this case\r\ncontains an uncontradicted account of the events underlying Dueno's\r\n1994 breaking and entering conviction, that the account (which\r\ndescribes in detail a home invasion followed by serious vandalism)\r\nwould suggest that Dueno in fact pleaded guilty to breaking into\r\nand entering a building, and that Harris authorizes us to look at\r\nsuch an uncontradicted account in circumstances such as these.  See964 F.2d at 1236-37.  In the government's view, the presence of\r\nthis uncontradicted recitation allows for only one conclusion: \r\nthat Dueno's breaking and entering conviction was for a crime of\r\nviolence.\r\nDueno counters by suggesting that the \"archaeological\r\ndig\" endorsed by Harris (which he says we have retreated from) runs\r\nafoul of the Supreme Court's mandate that inquiries into the nature\r\nof prior convictions follow a \"formal categorical approach [that]\r\nlook[s] only to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses,\r\nand not to the particular facts underlying those convictions.\" \r\nTaylor, 495 U.S. at 600.  He also contends that the \"dig\"\r\nauthorized in Harris is now precluded by application note 2 to\r\nU.S.S.G.  4B1.2 (effective November 1, 1997), which he reads as a\r\ncodification of Taylor's categorical approach in the guidelines\r\ncontext.  Finally, he asserts that the Presentence Report took its\r\naccount from a police report that was not even a part of the state\r\ncourt file, and contends that such a report, even if cognizable\r\nunder Harris, is too tenuous a foundation to support our concluding\r\nas a matter of law that Dueno pleaded guilty to breaking into and\r\nentering a building.\r\nDueno's first two arguments fail to persuade.  Our\r\nopinion in Harris came two years after Taylor and demonstrated full\r\ncognizance of the dictates of Taylor's categorical approach.  See964 F.2d at 1235-36.  Thus, neither Taylor nor the guidelines'\r\nrecent codification of the Taylor approach (we shall assume\r\narguendo that Dueno correctly interprets application note 2 to\r\nU.S.S.G.  4B1.2) provides us with any basis for backtracking from\r\nHarris.  See, e.g., Williams v. Ashland Eng'g Co., Inc., 45 F.3d\r\n588, 592 (1st Cir. 1995) (newly-constituted panels in a multi-panel\r\ncircuit are bound by prior panel decisions not called into doubt by\r\nintervening, controlling authority).  Moreover, we have carefully\r\nread our decisions applying Harris, and we see nothing in them\r\nwhich calls into question the validity of the inquiry Harrisauthorizes in circumstances such as these.\r\nBut although the issue is close, we do agree with Dueno\r\nthat, on the present record, a reasonable jurist could conclude\r\nthat there is insufficiently reliable evidence to ground a finding\r\nthat Dueno pleaded guilty to breaking into and entering a building. \r\nIn so concluding, we point out that the record in this case lacks\r\neven a single document that was before the judge who accepted\r\nDueno's plea in 1994 (not even a copy of the complaint).  Nor do we\r\nhave a copy of the police report in question (all we have is the\r\nPresentence Report, which apparently took its account from the\r\npolice report); an explanation where the police report came from;\r\nor any account of what took place at Dueno's plea hearing.  We also\r\nare mindful that the government bears the burden of proving the\r\napplicability of an upward adjustment under the guidelines, United\r\nStates v. St. Cyr, 977 F.2d 698, 702 (1st Cir. 1992), and that a\r\nsubstantial prison term for Dueno hangs in the balance.  \r\nDueno's sentence for this crime can reflect only those\r\nprior crimes of which he has been convicted   either by a trier of\r\nfact or by his own admission.  As matters now stand, the evidence\r\nis insufficient for us to conclude, as a matter of law, that\r\nDueno's 1994 guilty plea constituted an admission to the building\r\ninvasion described by the police report.  We therefore vacate the\r\nsentence and remand for resentencing.  On remand, we fully expect\r\nthat the government will give this matter significantly more\r\nattention than it has received to this point.\r\nVacated and remanded.\n",

The charges to which Dueno pleaded arose from his March 14, 1997 sale of a sawed-off shotgun to an undercover police officer.  At the time of the sale, Dueno had a number of prior criminal convictions, including a 1991 Massachusetts conviction for assault and battery, and a 1994 Massachusetts conviction following a guilty plea to a charged violation of a statute proscribing, \"in the night time, break[ing] and enter[ing] a building, ship, vessel, or vehicle, with intent to commit a felony.\"  Mass.

See U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2.  But they disagreed as to whether the 1994 breaking and entering conviction should be so regarded.  The dispute mattered because the charges to which Dueno pleaded in this case trigger the more draconian sentencing provisions of the career offender guideline, see United States v.

Furthermore, Dueno is subject to an enhanced sentence under the firearms guideline if found to be a career offender.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2K2.1(a)(1) (prescribing an enhanced sentence for a career offender who engages in a firearm offense with a firearm described in 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5845(a), which describes sawed-off shotguns).  For reasons explained below, the district court concluded that the 1994 breaking and entering conviction was a crime of violence and sentenced Dueno accordingly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The breaking and entering statute under which Dueno pleaded guilty encompasses conduct that constitutes a crime of violence (i.e., breaking into and entering a person's home, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2(a)(2) (\"burglary of a dwelling\" is a crime of violence)), and conduct that almost certainly does not (i.e., breaking into and entering a vehicle, see infra at 6-7 (rejecting the government's suggestion that we affirm by ruling that all of the conduct described by the statute is violent);  cf.

When faced with a prior conviction under such a statute, a federal sentencing court may not hold a mini-trial on the particular facts underlying the prior offense in an effort to determine whether the defendant's conduct was violent.

But it may \"peek beneath the coverlet\" of the language of the prior judgment to ascertain whether the conviction was for a violent or a non-violent crime.  Winter, 22 F.3d at 18.   Ordinarily, this \"peek\" should be limited to an examination of the indictment, complaint, and/or jury instructions in the prior case.  See Damon, 127 F.3d at 144-45;  cf. Taylor, 495 U.S. at 602, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112435\"><a href=\"/opinion/112435/taylor-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

But where, as apparently was the case here,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> the charging papers simply used the boilerplate statutory formulation and there are no jury instructions (because of the guilty plea), we have found it</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>appropriate for the sentencing court to look to the conduct in respect to which the defendant was charged and pled guilty, not because the court may properly be interested (in this context) in the violent or non-violent nature of that particular conduct, but because that conduct may indicate that the defendant and the government both believed that the generically violent crime ... rather than the generically non-violent crime ... was at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Harris, 964 F.2d at 1236.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the government successfully argued at sentencing that, notwithstanding the generic nature of the breaking and entering charge set forth in the 1994 state court complaint, a fair reading of the complaint as a whole establishes that Dueno broke into and entered a building, and thus committed a crime of violence.  The government based its argument on a second charge in the same complaint, which apparently alleged that Dueno \"willingly and maliciously destroy[ed] or injur[ed] the personal property, dwelling, house or building of [the victim], the value of the property so destroyed or injured exceeding two hundred and fifty dollars, in violation of [Mass.  Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 266, &#167; 127].\"  The government now correctly concedes that its prior argument, and the district court's acceptance of the argument, are not sustainable;  even if it could be inferred that both charges in the complaint arose from essentially the same course of criminal conduct, the complaint can as readily be taken to describe an unlawful entry into a vehicle, followed by vandalism in the vehicle causing more than $250 worth of damage, as it can be taken to describe a building invasion.  We therefore cannot affirm the determination that Dueno is a career offender under the reasoning of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that, despite this error, we can affirm Dueno's sentence on one of two proffered alternative grounds.  First, the government asks us to rule that breaking into and entering any of the three non-buildings specified in Mass.  Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 266, &#167; 16--a ship, vessel, or vehicle--is a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2(a)'s \"otherwise\" clause.  See id.  (defining crime of violence as one that is punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year and (1) \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another\";  (2) \"is burglary of a dwelling, arson, ... extortion, [or] involves use of explosives\";  or (3) \"otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\")  (emphasis supplied).  Accepting this argument, which the government first advanced in the last two paragraphs of its appellate brief, would entail our becoming the first federal court of appeals to rule that breaking into and entering a vehicle is a crime of violence.  We are loath to issue so significant a ruling where Dueno had insufficient opportunity to develop a factual rebuttal (e.g., the introduction of relevant crime statistics and/or expert testimony) in the lower court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, we think it potentially important that the case on which the government entirely relies in pressing this argument, see United States v.
