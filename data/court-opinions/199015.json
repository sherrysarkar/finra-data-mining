Scarborough, Appellate Staff, Civil Division,\nDepartment of Justice, with whom David W. Ogden, Acting\nAssistant Attorney General, and Robert S. Greenspan, Appellate\nStaff, Civil Division, Department of Justice, were on brief for\nrespondent.\n\n\n\n\n                          July 25, 2000\n\f\f              BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.      Petitioner, Aviators for Safe\n\nand Fairer Regulation, Inc. (\"Aviators\"), is a trade association\n\nof about fifty on-demand air charter companies.            It brings this\n\ncase to challenge a so-called notice of enforcement policy\n\nissued   by    the   Federal   Aviation   Administration    (\"FAA\")   that\n\npurports to interpret, and to express its intent to enforce, a\n\npreexisting regulation governing how much rest pilots or other\n\nflight crewmembers must get between flight assignments.\n\n              Air charter companies furnish \"air taxi\" service to\n\ncustomers on demand rather than on a scheduled basis.            The FAA\n\nregulates such companies under Part 135 of its regulations, 14\n\nC.F.R. pt. 135 (2000).         The regulation at issue in this case,\n\nid. § 135.267(d), was adopted in its current form in October\n\n1985 and aims to ensure that pilots have adequate rest for\n\npurposes of air safety, see 49 U.S.C. §§ 40101(d), 44701(a)(4)-\n\n(5) (1994 & Supp. II 1996).        It states, in relevant part, that\n\neach flight assignment to unscheduled one- and two-pilot crews\n\n\"must provide for at least 10 consecutive hours of rest during\n\nthe 24-hour period that precedes the planned completion time of\n\nthe assignment.\"       14 C.F.R. § 135.267(d).\n\n              The term \"rest\" is not defined in the regulation.         On\n\nseveral occasions, the FAA sought to refine the term through\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\frulemaking but those efforts were abortive.1           Then, on June 15,\n\n1999, without prior notice or rulemaking proceedings, the FAA\n\nissued a \"notice of enforcement policy.\"         The notice said that\n\nit was merely reiterating the FAA's \"longstanding interpretation\n\nof its regulations\" concerning rest requirements and continued\n\nin pertinent part:\n\n          [T]he FAA has consistently interpreted the\n          term rest to mean that a flight crewmember\n          is free from actual work from the air\n          carrier or from present responsibility for\n          work should the occasion arise.    Thus the\n          FAA previously has determined that a flight\n          crewmember on reserve was not at rest if the\n          flight    crewmember    had     a    present\n          responsibility for work in that the flight\n          crewmember had to be available for the\n          carrier to notify of a flight assignment.\n\nNotice of Enforcement Policy, 64 Fed. Reg. 32176, 32176 (1999).\n\nThe principal controversy centers upon how (and in one case\n\nwhether) the notice resolves two different scenarios, which we\n\nshall   refer   to   as   the   duty-to-report   and    the   duty-to-be-\n\navailable.\n\n\n    1See, e.g., Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 60 Fed. Reg.\n65951, 65959-61, 65976 (1995); Notice of New Task Assignment for\nthe Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC), 63 Fed. Reg.\n37167, 37167 (1998). The term \"rest,\" again without definition,\nis used in several other regulations establishing flight crew\nrest requirements for larger and scheduled carriers, see 14\nC.F.R. §§ 121.471(b), 135.265(b) (2000) (9 to 11 continuous\nhours in the 24-hour period preceding completion of a flight\nassignment); id. §§ 121.471(d), 135.265(d) (one uninterrupted\n24-hour   period  weekly);   the  term   appears   to  be   used\ninterchangeably among these regulations.\n\n                                   -4-\n\f             In the duty-to-report scenario, a crewmember who is\n\nnominally off duty has a responsibility during the period to\n\nleave a contact number, to be fit to fly, to take any telephone\n\ncalls   or    other     communications      notifying     him      of    a   flight\n\nassignment, and to report for that assignment in a reasonable\n\ntime (e.g., two hours).         In the duty-to-be-available scenario,\n\nthe same is true but the crewmember has the option to accept or\n\ndecline a flight assignment that is offered during this off-duty\n\nperiod.      It is easy to see why such arrangements would be\n\nattractive to an air taxi carrier.\n\n             Under     either   scenario,    a   call   to    the       crewmember\n\nfollowed     by   an   accepted   assignment      would      (at    some     stage)\n\nterminate any \"rest\" that might otherwise be accruing.                         The\n\ncrewmember, to be eligible for the assignment, would have to\n\nhave met the \"ten hours rest\" quota based on \"rest\" that had\n\nalready occurred.        But the FAA's position in its notice as to\n\nthe duty-to-report scenario (the duty-to-be-available scenario\n\nis a different issue) is that even if no call were made during\n\nthis nominal off-duty period, none of the period would count as\n\nrest because the generic responsibility to leave a number, take\n\ncalls, and report if assigned would negate \"rest\" for the entire\n\nperiod.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f             Aviators sought direct review of the notice under 49\n\nU.S.C. § 46110 (1994), which permits any person \"disclosing a\n\nsubstantial interest in an order issued by\" the FAA with respect\n\nto aviation safety matters to seek review in an appropriate\n\ncourt of appeals, id. § 46110(a).                  The court of appeals has\n\n\"exclusive jurisdiction to affirm, amend, modify or set aside\n\nany part of the order and it may order\" the FAA to conduct\n\nfurther      proceedings.          Id.    §   46110(c).      We    consider    first\n\nthreshold issues as to our authority to review the notice; then,\n\nAviators' procedural claim that the notice required notice and\n\ncomment rulemaking; and last, Aviators' substantive attacks on\n\nthe FAA's position.\n\n             1.   The FAA does not directly dispute that its notice\n\nof enforcement policy constitutes an \"order,\" but raises the\n\nissue obliquely, saying that it is merely giving advance notice\n\nof an intention to enforce the law.                    Whether a notice thus\n\nlimited would be reviewable is beside the point; here, the FAA's\n\n\"notice\" adopts a firm interpretation of an existing regulation.\n\nThe   term     \"order\"    is       read    expansively    in      review   statutes\n\ngenerally, 5 U.S.C. § 551(6) (1994) (an \"order\" includes \"the\n\nwhole   or    a   part   of    a   final      disposition,     [including     those]\n\ndeclaratory in form\"), and this statute specifically, New York\n\nv. FAA, 712 F.2d 806, 808 (2d Cir. 1983); Northwest Airlines,\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fInc. v. Goldschmidt, 645 F.2d 1309, 1313-14 (8th Cir. 1981).                         To\n\nthat extent, the notice here qualifies as a reviewable \"order,\"\n\nassuming other conditions (e.g., finality, ripeness) are met.\n\n            Several circuits (although not this one) have said that\n\nthere must be \"an administrative record\" for agency action to be\n\na reviewable order under section 46110.                      See, e.g., Green v.\n\nBrantley, 981 F.2d 514, 519 (11th Cir. 1993); City of Alexandria\n\nv. Helms, 728 F.2d 643, 646 (4th Cir. 1984).                      Yet almost all of\n\nthese    cases    find    that      the     requisite       record     need   not   be\n\nsubstantial so long as the agency's position is definitive and\n\nclearly expressed.       See San Diego Air Sports Ctr., Inc. v.                 FAA,\n\n887 F.2d 966, 969 (9th Cir. 1989) (a letter may suffice).                            In\n\nany event, an inadequate record is more likely to be a basis for\n\nsetting aside final agency action than for refusing to review\n\nit.     See Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, 401 U.S.\n\n402, 419-20 (1971).\n\n            The FAA does not contest the notice's finality--and\n\nwith good reason.          The notice is unquestionably final in a\n\nprocedural    sense:          it    is    not    a   proposal     to   interpret      a\n\nregulation, and there is no indication that the FAA plans to\n\nconduct     further      proceedings            on   this    declaration.           See\n\nAlexandria,      728   F.2d    at    646.        Rather,    the    FAA's   principal\n\nchallenge to our review at this time--its request that review be\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fdeferred until there is an actual enforcement proceeding in\n\nwhich objections might be raised in defense--is an argument\n\nproperly considered under the rubric of ripeness.                     See Public\n\nServ. Comm'n v. Patch, 167 F.3d 15, 23 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n            An issue is ripe for judicial review if it is \"fit\" for\n\nimmediate review and delay would impose \"undue hardship\" on\n\nlitigants.     Abbott     Labs.   v.    Gardner,    387   U.S.   136,     148-49\n\n(1967).    As to hardship, the FAA's notice promised \"enforcement\"\n\n(after a 180-day grace period that has already expired, 64 Fed.\n\nReg. 32176, 32176 (1999)), not opportunities for negotiations or\n\nfurther clarification, and enforcement may include penalties up\n\nto   and   including    the   revocation     of    charters,     14    C.F.R.   §\n\n13.19(b) (2000).       Conversely, compliance may also require major\n\nchanges in air taxi operations, and deferral of review would\n\nclearly threaten hardship.         Cf. Lincoln House, Inc. v. Dupre,\n\n903 F.2d 845, 847 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n            With respect to fitness, the most common concern is\n\nwhether a rule or order is framed in terms so general that only\n\nits application to specific facts (usually in an enforcement\n\nproceeding) would permit the court to make a reasoned judgment.\n\nPatch, 167 F.3d at 23.        As to the duty-to-report scenario, we\n\nthink that the FAA's position is plain enough from the language\n\n\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fof its notice,2 especially when read in light of prior statements\n\n(discussed below), and involves a clear-cut pattern of conduct\n\nthat may arise frequently in air taxi operations.                In this\n\nrespect, the notice is well fit for review at this time.\n\n          The     duty-to-be-available     scenario   is    different.\n\nAlthough Aviators has presented a distinct pattern of conduct\n\nlikely to be important to air taxi operations, we find no\n\nsimilar clarity in the notice (see note 2, below), or earlier\n\ninterpretive letters (see note 6, below), to show how the FAA\n\nwould resolve the scenario.      True, one footnote in the FAA's\n\nbrief, and its statements at oral argument, suggest that an\n\nunrequited    duty-to-be-available    is   not   \"rest,\"   but   we   are\n\nunwilling to bind the agency to the less-than-clear litigation\n\nposition of its lawyers in deciding whether a controversy is fit\n\nfor review.     Cf. Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. 204,\n\n212-13 (1988).\n\n          A final issue of \"authority\" which was not raised by\n\nthe FAA--indeed, it commendably conceded the point at oral\n\nargument--deserves to be mentioned.         The review statute, 49\n\n\n\n     2\n     Pertinently, the FAA notice says that the crewmember must\nbe \"free . . . from present responsibility for work should the\noccasion arise.\"    64 Fed. Reg. 32176, 32176 (1999).        By\ncontrast, in the duty-to-be-available scenario, it is much less\nclear that the crewmember has a \"present responsibility for\nwork\" since the assignment can be declined.\n\n                                -9-\n\fU.S.C.    §   46110    (1994),   imposes     a   sixty-day     time    limit    on\n\npetitions for review unless \"there are reasonable grounds for\n\nnot   filing    by    the   [sixtieth]   day\"    after   the    order,    id.    §\n\n46110(a).      Here, the petition for review (filed August 6, 1999)\n\nis timely as to the notice of enforcement policy (issued June\n\n15, 1999), but comes years after the order adopting the 1985\n\nregulation at issue.          Yet, as we will see, Aviators could be\n\nregarded in some respects as attacking the original regulation.\n\n              If so, this case arguably falls within the proviso of\n\nthe   statute     permitting     a   later   challenge    where       there    are\n\n\"reasonable grounds\" for the delay.3             Here, reasonable grounds\n\nprobably exist for a deferred attack inasmuch as neither the\n\noriginal 1985 regulation nor accompanying commentary eliminated\n\nuncertainty as to how the FAA might resolve any of a number of\n\nscenarios (including the duty-to-report and the duty-to-be-\n\navailable) that might arise in practice.              Cf. Charter Township\n\nof Huron v. Richards, 997 F.2d 1168, 1172-73 (6th Cir. 1993);\n\nGreater Orlando Aviation Auth. v. FAA, 939 F.2d 954, 960 (11th\n\nCir. 1991).\n\n\n\n      3\n      The proviso is unusual (compare the Hobbs Act, 28 U.S.C. §§\n2341-51 (1994 & Supp. II 1996)), but reviewing courts have often\nread the Hobbs Act and like statutes as containing an implicit\n\"good cause\" exception, see American Gas Ass'n v. FERC, 912 F.2d\n1496, 1514 (D.C. Cir. 1990); RCA Global Comms., Inc. v. FCC, 758\nF.2d 722, 730 (D.C. Cir. 1985).\n\n                                      -10-\n\f            2.     As the parties have briefed the issue, the first\n\nquestion on the merits is procedural:                    whether the FAA was\n\nrequired to conduct notice and comment rulemaking before issuing\n\nits notice of enforcement policy.                If the FAA were altering or\n\nenlarging    obligations      imposed       by   a    preexisting    regulation,\n\nnotice and comment rulemaking would be required, see Warder v.\n\nShalala, 149 F.3d 73, 80-81 (1st Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 67\n\nU.S.L.W. 3470 (U.S. Apr. 19, 1999) (No. 98-1131), but a mere\n\n\"interpretation\" can ordinarily be done without rulemaking, id.\n\nat   80;    see    also   5   U.S.C.    §     553(b)(B)    (1994).        Whether\n\n\"ordinarily\" means \"always\" is an interesting question.                         Cf.\n\nDugan v. Ramsay, 727 F.2d 192, 196-98 (1st Cir. 1984) (rejecting\n\nagency \"interpretation\" without rulemaking); Jicarilla Apache\n\nTribe v. FERC, 578 F.2d 289, 292-93 (10th Cir. 1978) (same).\n\n            To determine whether the FAA is altering or enlarging\n\nthe 1985 regulation depends on the \"meaning\" of the original\n\nregulation (validity is a different question).                   See Warder, 149\n\nF.3d at 80-81.      The 1985 regulation, as applied to the scenarios\n\nat issue, supplies no very clear answer because it does not\n\ndefine \"rest\" or otherwise indicate how the FAA would resolve\n\nthe duty-to-report scenario.            See 14 C.F.R. 135.267(d) (1986);\n\n50   Fed.   Reg.    29306,    29311-14,       29317    (1985).      Nor   is   help\n\nprovided by a precursor regulation first codified in 1970 from\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fwhich the key 1985 language was borrowed.           See 14 C.F.R. §\n\n135.136(b) (1970); 34 Fed. Reg. 1443, 1444 (1969).\n\n          Of course, subsequent administrative interpretation is\n\noften treated as evidencing, or substituting for, a supposed\n\n\"original\" intent.       See Mullins Coal Co. v. Director, 484 U.S.\n\n135, 159-60 (1987).       And the gist of Aviators' claim is that\n\ndespite   the open-textured quality of the 1985 regulation, it\n\nhad been given meaning over time and had come to rest in a well-\n\nsettled interpretation that is favorable to Aviators' cause,\n\nwhich the notice of enforcement policy mistakenly contradicts.\n\nA less extreme version is that at least the agency must give\n\n\"reasons\" why it is reversing an established position.             See\n\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463\n\nU.S. 29, 43 (1983); Citizens Awareness Network, Inc. v. Nuclear\n\nRegulatory Comm'n, 59 F.3d 284, 290 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n           As to the duty-to-report scenario, it is clear to us\n\nthat   there   is   no   \"reversal\":    the   FAA   has   consistently\n\nmaintained--in its interpretive letters, bulletins, and other\n\nstatements--that an off-duty period encumbered by the threat of\n\ninterruption from a mandatory assignment is not rest.             For\n\nexample, Flight Standards Information Bulletin 92-02 (Jan. 24,\n\n1992) states that \"the FAA has consistently interpreted its\n\n\"nest\" requirement to be satisfied only if the rest time is:\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fdetermined prospectively . . . .           A period of time during which\n\na pilot has a present responsibility for work, if called, does\n\nnot qualify as a rest period.         This should be contrasted with a\n\npilot who does not have a present responsibility to fly, when\n\ncalled.\"4\n\n              Admittedly, this position, whether in its most recent\n\narticulation        in   the   notice,     or   in   the   FAA's   previous\n\nexplanations, is not as clear as it could be;5 but it is clear\n\nenough.       In fact, there are interpretative statements to the\n\nsame effect preceding 1985.         See, e.g., Letter from A.W. Lalle,\n\nActing Associate General Counsel, FAA, to John F. Nevins, Air\n\nLine       Pilots   Association   (Feb.    5,   1968)   (\"[W]hen   a   flight\n\n\n\n       4\n     See also Letter from Donald P. Byrne, Assistant Chief\nCounsel, FAA, to Frederick G. Pappas, Jr., Director, Flight\nServices, Midwest Corporate Aviation, Inc. (June 24, 1991) (\"[A]\nrest period must be prospective in nature. Stated another way,\na flight crewmember must be told in advance that he or she will\nbe on a rest period for the duration required by the\nregulations.   In addition, a rest period must be free of all\nrestraint.   However, the Agency's interpretations hold that\nreceipt of one telephone call or beeper call does not constitute\na violation of a rest period provision.      Moreover, a flight\ncrewmember in a rest period must be free of present\nresponsibility for work should the occasion arise.\").\n       5\n     Interestingly, \"rest period\" is defined in section\n135.273(a), a different section of the same subpart as the\nregulation at issue, added in 1994 to govern flight attendants\nin air charter operations. 14 C.F.R. § 135.273(a) (2000); 59\nFed. Reg. 42663, 42663 (1994).    It is there defined as \"the\nperiod free of all responsibility for work or duty should the\noccasion arise,\" the very language used in the 1999 notice.\n\n                                    -13-\n\fcrewmember    is   required     by    the    air   carrier   to   hold   himself\n\navailable to call, it constitutes a restraint which interrupts\n\nthe 24-hour period, which we have held should be free from a\n\nloss of freedom or restraint.\").              More important, there is no\n\nevidence that the FAA has ever said that the duty-to-report\n\nscenario did count as rest.             The 1992 FAA bulletin on which\n\nAviators relies, which we have just quoted, actually hurts its\n\n\"reversal\" claim.\n\n            Nor are we troubled by Aviators' argument that the\n\nFAA's   current      position    on    the    duty-to-report       scenario    is\n\ninconsistent with a decision by the Eighth Circuit.                    See United\n\nStates v. Ozark Airlines, Inc., 506 F.2d 526 (8th Cir. 1974).\n\nThat decision construed a weekly rest requirement regulation, 14\n\nC.F.R. 121.471(d) (1970), and inferred from the use of \"duty\" in\n\nother subsections that rest \"from all further duty\" meant rest\n\nfrom \"duty aloft.\"       Ozark, 506 F.2d at 237.             \"Duty aloft\" was\n\nchanged to \"flight time\" in the 1985 version of this regulation\n\nto   make    clear    that      \"duty,\"      for   purposes       of   the   rest\n\nrequirements, was a broader concept than \"duty aloft.\"                    See 14.\n\nC.F.R. §§ 121.471(a)-(c) (1986).\n\n            By contrast, the FAA has been much less consistent as\n\nto the duty-to-be-available scenario. The relevant interpretive\n\n\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fletters appear not merely in tension, but at odds,6 and on this\n\npoint, the 1992 Bulletin is arguably helpful to Aviators.                     See\n\nFlight Standards Information Bulletin 92-02 (\"A period of time\n\nduring which a pilot has a present responsibility for work, if\n\ncalled, does not qualify as a rest period.                     This should be\n\ncontrasted    with     a    pilot       who    does   not   have    a     present\n\nresponsibility    to       fly,   when    called.\").        But,   as     earlier\n\nexplained, we still do not know for sure how the FAA would\n\nresolve this latter scenario.            3.    This brings us to Aviators'\n\nsubstantive attacks, whether treated as attacks on the notice or\n\non   the   regulation      itself.        Here,    the   FAA   starts     with   a\n\nsubstantial   advantage:          the    question     how   much   rest    flight\n\ncrewmembers should be given to guard against pilot fatigue and\n\nwhat interruptions should count against satisfying the ten-hour\n\nrest requirement are technical issues involving safety where the\n\nagency's latitude is substantial.                 See 49 U.S.C. § 40101(d),\n\n\n     6Compare Letter from Donald P. Byrne, Assistant Chief\nCounsel, FAA, to Frederick G. Pappas, Jr., Director, Flight\nServices, Midwest Corporate Aviation, Inc. (June 24, 1991)\n(\"Does a pager check during a 24 hour standby period interrupt\ncrew rest? . . . [S]tandy does not constitute crew rest. The\npager check does not interrupt crew rest because crew rest is\nnot taking place.\"), with Letter from Donald P. Byrne, Assistant\nChief Counsel, FAA, to B. Stephen Fortenberry, Evergreen\nInternational Airlines, Inc., (undated, in response to a letter\ndated October 12, 1989, with respect to section 121.471(d)) (\"Is\ntelephone standby in a hotel or at home 'duty'? No, not in the\nsense that it produces the need for the rest period required by\nsection 121.471(d).\").\n\n                                        -15-\n\f44701(a)(4)-(5) (1994 & Supp. II 1996); see also Bargmann v.\n\nHelms, 715 F.2d 638, 641-42 (D.C. Cir. 1983); Air Line Pilots\n\nAss'n Int'l v. Quesada, 276 F.2d 892, 898 (2d Cir. 1960).           And\n\nabsent a mistake of law, the standard of review is whether the\n\nagency's   actions   are   arbitrary   or   capricious,    5   U.S.C.   §\n\n706(2)(a) (1994), and whether any fact findings it made rest on\n\nsubstantial evidence, 49 U.S.C. § 46110(c) (1994).\n\n           Nevertheless, Aviators says that the FAA admits that\n\na brief, unexpected phone call from the carrier does not disturb\n\nrest so as to require the ten-hour clock to be restarted.          See,\n\ne.g., Letter from Donald P. Byrne, Assistant Chief Counsel, FAA,\n\nto Albert C. Pod, Vice President, Executive Jet Management (Apr.\n\n19, 1991).   The FAA verified at oral argument that it has not\n\ndisclaimed that position, and indeed, the language of the 1999\n\nnotice --\"if the flight crewmember . . . had to be available for\n\nthe carrier to notify of a flight assignment\"--arguably would\n\nnot be triggered by an unanticipated phone call.          Aviators says\n\nthat, in light of this concession, it is irrational to deny the\n\n\"rest\" label in the duty-to-report scenario when no call in fact\n\noccurs.\n\n           We do not agree.    The agency is perfectly entitled to\n\nregard a single unexpected phone call as less of a psychological\n\ninterruption to pilot rest than the continuing burden that\n\n\n                                -16-\n\fexists in the duty-to-report scenario even when no call occurs.\n\nIn the latter case, the pilot is effectively on a leash and\n\nknows that at any point (after ten hours) he may be summoned\n\nback to duty, for which he must remain \"fit\" to fly.                    Whether or\n\nnot   the    FAA    has   drawn    the    line    in    the   right    place,   the\n\ndistinction drawn is not irrational.\n\n             Aviators' best claim is that there is no \"explanation\n\nor evidence\" in the record that excluding the duty-to-report\n\ntime from \"rest\" is \"necessary for, or even advances\" safety.\n\nAnd, although the FAA has elsewhere referred to \"scientific\n\nstudies of fatigue,\" Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 60 Fed. Reg.\n\n65951,      65951   (1995),   it    points       to    no   evidence   or   even   a\n\nthoughtful discussion of the specific issue either in the notice\n\nor in the order adopting the 1985 regulation.                         Instead, the\n\nFAA's brief offers an explanation.                To remove the taint of post\n\nhoc rationalization, see State Farm, 463 U.S. at 50; Natural\n\nResources Defense Council v. EPA, 824 F.2d 1258, 1286 & n.19\n\n(1st Cir. 1987), we note that the explanation is pretty obvious;\n\nthe harder question is whether it is sufficient.\n\n             The FAA's commonsense explanation is this:                  given the\n\npurpose of the rest requirement to assure that the flight crew\n\nis refreshed and alert, anything that materially compromises a\n\nstate of affairs conducive to rest threatens refreshment and\n\n\n                                         -17-\n\falertness; and a flight crewmember who is on call and subject to\n\nthe various duties imposed by the duty-to-report scenario is\n\nless likely to be as refreshed and alert as one who need not\n\nworry that a demand to fly may come at any time.                  This is\n\nplausible enough; neither administrators nor judges are expected\n\nto ignore the known realities of human existence.               See, e.g.,\n\nTexas E. Prods. Pipeline Co. v. OSHA, 827 F.2d 46, 49 (7th Cir.\n\n1987) (affirming agency's \"common sense reading\" that a \"hole in\n\nthe ground is, after all, a hole in the ground\").\n\n           The force of this commonsense explanation is reinforced\n\nby the fact of its long standing--at least fifty years.                 In\n\n1949,    the   acting   general   counsel   of    the   Civil     Aviation\n\nAdministration was asked for an interpretation of then-existing\n\n\"relief from all duty\" requirements.             Letter from Robert P.\n\nBoyle, Acting General Counsel, Civil Aviation Administration, to\n\nCoordinator, International Field Office, Lima, Peru (April 22,\n\n1949).   The inquiry presented the following scenario:            \"[An air\n\ncarrier] schedules a 'stand by' crew which must remain at home\n\nsubject to immediate call as replacement in case any of the\n\noriginally scheduled crew are unable, because of sickness, etc.,\n\nto take the trip out as scheduled.       This 'stand by' crew, if not\n\ncalled as a replacement on that day, is then scheduled as a\n\nregular crew for a trip on the following day.\"          Id.\n\n\n                                  -18-\n\f          In response, the acting general counsel ruled:\n\n          This appears to be such a lack of freedom of\n          restraint and release from duty as to\n          prevent the full and free exercise of an\n          opportunity to rest intended by the rest\n          period   provisions   of   the   Civil   Air\n          Regulations.    It is immaterial that the\n          pilots are not required to report to the\n          airport or actively engage in work for the\n          air carrier during the period of the stand\n          by schedule. The term \"relief from duty\" as\n          used in the above-noted section means that\n          the pilot must be relieved from either\n          actual work for the air carrier or present\n          responsibility for such should the occasion\n          arise.   A \"stand by\" schedule of the type\n          described in the memorandum does not provide\n          such relief from all duty with the air\n          carrier.\n\nId.\n\n          Of     course,   without    \"evidence,\"      we    have   no   way    of\n\nknowing just how much these stand-by duties do compromise rest.\n\nBut   agencies     often   make   choices      where        no   evidence      can\n\ndemonstrate a single right answer.          Determining cut-off toxicity\n\nexposures in environmental regulation, see Public Citizen Health\n\nResearch Group v.      Tyson, 796 F.2d 1479, 1504-05 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1986), or rates of return in utility cases, see Borough of\n\nEllwood City v. FERC, 731 F.2d 959, 974-75 (D.C. Cir. 1984), are\n\ngood examples.     Where, as here, the agency’s choice appears to\n\nbe within a zone of reasonableness, a court will normally defer.\n\nSee Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474, 477 (1951);\n\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\fConsolidated Oil & Gas, Inc. v. FERC, 806 F.2d 275, 279 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1986).\n\n            The    more       serious       difficulty         is   the     lack    of    an\n\nopportunity       for   Aviators       or    other       opponents     to    offer      such\n\nrebuttal commentary or evidence.                   But, of course, Aviators has\n\nnot claimed to have medical studies or expert testimony to show\n\nthat the restrictive reading serves little or no purpose: it\n\nsays only that the FAA has failed to provide supporting evidence\n\nof    its   own.         Perhaps       Aviators          can    develop         compelling\n\nphysiological evidence or collect the testimony of affected\n\npilots to show that duty-to-report time gives pilots as much\n\n\"rest\" as time at home with no overhanging responsibilities.                              If\n\nso, Aviators can file a petition tendering the evidence and\n\nasking the FAA to modify its regulation accordingly.                              5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 553(e) (1994).\n\n            This    is    a    close    case       and    we    have      given    careful\n\nconsideration as to whether a remand might be warranted.                                 But\n\nthe   FAA’s   position        on   duty-to-report           time    is     on     its   face\n\nplausible even without evidentiary support; this position has\n\nbeen consistent over time, even assuming that enforcement has\n\nbeen lax; and there is no indication from Aviators that it could\n\nsupply useful evidence if we did order a remand.                          The FAA should\n\nnot assume that the duty-to-be-available scenario--only a step\n\n\n                                            -20-\n\ffurther   down      the    road    but     a     significant       step   since    the\n\ncrewmember could refuse the assignment--would automatically be\n\nsustainable on the same basis.\n\n            A somewhat different rationale for its narrow view of\n\n\"rest\" seems to be articulated in the FAA's brief in this court\n\nwhich might, if adopted by the agency itself, provide additional\n\nsupport for its position on the duty-to-report scenario and also\n\napply   equally     to     the    duty-to-be-available             scenario.       The\n\nreasoning    does    not    depend        on   the    psychological       burden    of\n\noverhanging      obligations        but    on     the        possible   threat    that\n\nrecalling the flight crewmember to duty after the initial ten\n\nhours of rest could throw off the sleeping rhythms of pilots in\n\nan unacceptable way.7            This concern, which the FAA itself may\n\nnever have articulated, may or may not be substantial, and we\n\nexpress no opinion on the merits.\n\n            Last,    Aviators       says       that     the     FAA's   position    is\n\nunreasonable      and      unfair     because           no     corresponding      rest\n\nrequirements exist for fractional ownership programs, which\n\n\n\n    7 The example given by the FAA brief (slightly corrected) is\nof a pilot who goes off duty at midnight on Monday night, wakes\non Tuesday at 6:30 a.m. and would normally go to sleep again at\n11 p.m. If the pilot is subject to recall on two hours' notice\nafter 10 a.m. on Tuesday, conceivably he could be called at 10\np.m. on Tuesday for a flight at 12:30 a.m. on Wednesday at which\npoint he will have been awake for 18 hours already, unaware that\nsometime during that period he should have gotten some sleep.\n\n                                          -21-\n\fallegedly compete with air taxi carriers but are governed by\n\nPart 91 of the FAA's regulations, 14 C.F.R. 91 (2000).          This\n\nargument has not been well developed in this court; and there\n\nmay be substantive differences in operations that justify the\n\nFAA's   decision   to   regulate   the   two   kinds   of   programs\n\ndifferently.   But the FAA would have some explaining to do if\n\nthe two sets of operations are pertinently the same, especially\n\nif there is a competitive relationship between them.        Cf. Town\n\nof Norwood v. New England Power Co., 202 F.3d 392, 402-03 (1st\n\nCir.), petition for cert. filed, 68 U.S.L.W. 3756 (U.S. May 30,\n\n2000) (No. 99-1914).\n\n          However, agencies are not normally required to solve\n\nall similar problems at one time.     See Mobil Oil Exploration v.\n\nUnited Distrib. Co., 498 U.S. 211, 231 (1991).          The FAA is\n\ncurrently reviewing its regulation of those fractional ownership\n\nprograms in separate proceedings.     Aviators is free to argue its\n\ncase in those proceedings, and if unsuccessful, it may seek\n\nreview of that agency action under the same statute that enabled\n\nreview in this case, 49 U.S.C. § 46110 (1994), or file a\n\npetition for rulemaking to modify the current regulation         (14\n\nC.F.R. § 135.267(d) (2000)) and spell out then the disparate\n\nimpact claim in greater detail, 5 U.S.C. § 553(e) (1994).\n\n\n\n\n                               -22-\n\f          Accordingly, we sustain the FAA as to the duty-to-\n\nreport scenario and treat as unripe Aviators' claims regarding\n\nthe duty-to-be-available scenario.       With respect to the latter,\n\nAviators is free to seek a formal declaratory ruling from the\n\nFAA and to present its policy arguments and evidence to the\n\nagency.   See 5 U.S.C. § 554(e) (1994).          While the agency has\n\ndiscretion to refuse such a ruling, that refusal is reviewable\n\nfor abuse of discretion, see Intercity Transp. Co. v. United\n\nStates, 737 F.2d 103, 106-07 (D.C. Cir. 1984); cf. DeNovellis v.\n\nShalala, 124 F.3d 298, 313 (1st Cir. 1997), and we think that a\n\nrefusal   to   tell   Aviators   in   advance   whether   the   scenario\n\nconstitutes \"rest\" would itself require a lot of explaining.\n\n          The petition for review is denied to the extent stated\n\nand otherwise dismissed as presenting an issue unripe for review\n\nat this time.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -23-\n\f",

Petitioner, Aviators for Safe\n\nand Fairer Regulation, Inc. (\"Aviators\"), is a trade association\n\nof about fifty on-demand air charter companies.            It brings this\n\ncase to challenge a so-called notice of enforcement policy\n\nissued   by    the   Federal   Aviation   Administration    (\"FAA\")   that\n\npurports to interpret, and to express its intent to enforce, a\n\npreexisting regulation governing how much rest pilots or other\n\nflight crewmembers must get between flight assignments.\n\n              Air charter companies furnish \"air taxi\" service to\n\ncustomers on demand rather than on a scheduled basis.            The FAA\n\nregulates such companies under Part 135 of its regulations, 14\n\nC.F.R. pt. 135 (2000).         The regulation at issue in this case,\n\nid. § 135.267(d), was adopted in its current form in October\n\n1985 and aims to ensure that pilots have adequate rest for\n\npurposes of air safety, see 49 U.S.C. §§ 40101(d), 44701(a)(4)-\n\n(5) (1994 & Supp. II 1996).        It states, in relevant part, that\n\neach flight assignment to unscheduled one- and two-pilot crews\n\n\"must provide for at least 10 consecutive hours of rest during\n\nthe 24-hour period that precedes the planned completion time of\n\nthe assignment.\"       14 C.F.R. § 135.267(d).\n\n              The term \"rest\" is not defined in the regulation.         On\n\nseveral occasions, the FAA sought to refine the term through\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\frulemaking but those efforts were abortive.1           Then, on June 15,\n\n1999, without prior notice or rulemaking proceedings, the FAA\n\nissued a \"notice of enforcement policy.\"         The notice said that\n\nit was merely reiterating the FAA's \"longstanding interpretation\n\nof its regulations\" concerning rest requirements and continued\n\nin pertinent part:\n\n          [T]he FAA has consistently interpreted the\n          term rest to mean that a flight crewmember\n          is free from actual work from the air\n          carrier or from present responsibility for\n          work should the occasion arise.    Thus the\n          FAA previously has determined that a flight\n          crewmember on reserve was not at rest if the\n          flight    crewmember    had     a    present\n          responsibility for work in that the flight\n          crewmember had to be available for the\n          carrier to notify of a flight assignment.\n\nNotice of Enforcement Policy, 64 Fed. Reg. 32176, 32176 (1999).\n\nThe principal controversy centers upon how (and in one case\n\nwhether) the notice resolves two different scenarios, which we\n\nshall   refer   to   as   the   duty-to-report   and    the   duty-to-be-\n\navailable.\n\n\n    1See, e.g., Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 60 Fed. Reg.\n65951, 65959-61, 65976 (1995); Notice of New Task Assignment for\nthe Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC), 63 Fed. Reg.\n37167, 37167 (1998). The term \"rest,\" again without definition,\nis used in several other regulations establishing flight crew\nrest requirements for larger and scheduled carriers, see 14\nC.F.R. §§ 121.471(b), 135.265(b) (2000) (9 to 11 continuous\nhours in the 24-hour period preceding completion of a flight\nassignment); id. §§ 121.471(d), 135.265(d) (one uninterrupted\n24-hour   period  weekly);   the  term   appears   to  be   used\ninterchangeably among these regulations.\n\n                                   -4-\n\f             In the duty-to-report scenario, a crewmember who is\n\nnominally off duty has a responsibility during the period to\n\nleave a contact number, to be fit to fly, to take any telephone\n\ncalls   or    other     communications      notifying     him      of    a   flight\n\nassignment, and to report for that assignment in a reasonable\n\ntime (e.g., two hours).         In the duty-to-be-available scenario,\n\nthe same is true but the crewmember has the option to accept or\n\ndecline a flight assignment that is offered during this off-duty\n\nperiod.      It is easy to see why such arrangements would be\n\nattractive to an air taxi carrier.\n\n             Under     either   scenario,    a   call   to    the       crewmember\n\nfollowed     by   an   accepted   assignment      would      (at    some     stage)\n\nterminate any \"rest\" that might otherwise be accruing.                         The\n\ncrewmember, to be eligible for the assignment, would have to\n\nhave met the \"ten hours rest\" quota based on \"rest\" that had\n\nalready occurred.        But the FAA's position in its notice as to\n\nthe duty-to-report scenario (the duty-to-be-available scenario\n\nis a different issue) is that even if no call were made during\n\nthis nominal off-duty period, none of the period would count as\n\nrest because the generic responsibility to leave a number, take\n\ncalls, and report if assigned would negate \"rest\" for the entire\n\nperiod.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f             Aviators sought direct review of the notice under 49\n\nU.S.C. § 46110 (1994), which permits any person \"disclosing a\n\nsubstantial interest in an order issued by\" the FAA with respect\n\nto aviation safety matters to seek review in an appropriate\n\ncourt of appeals, id. § 46110(a).                  The court of appeals has\n\n\"exclusive jurisdiction to affirm, amend, modify or set aside\n\nany part of the order and it may order\" the FAA to conduct\n\nfurther      proceedings.          Id.    §   46110(c).      We    consider    first\n\nthreshold issues as to our authority to review the notice; then,\n\nAviators' procedural claim that the notice required notice and\n\ncomment rulemaking; and last, Aviators' substantive attacks on\n\nthe FAA's position.\n\n             1.   The FAA does not directly dispute that its notice\n\nof enforcement policy constitutes an \"order,\" but raises the\n\nissue obliquely, saying that it is merely giving advance notice\n\nof an intention to enforce the law.                    Whether a notice thus\n\nlimited would be reviewable is beside the point; here, the FAA's\n\n\"notice\" adopts a firm interpretation of an existing regulation.\n\nThe   term     \"order\"    is       read    expansively    in      review   statutes\n\ngenerally, 5 U.S.C. § 551(6) (1994) (an \"order\" includes \"the\n\nwhole   or    a   part   of    a   final      disposition,     [including     those]\n\ndeclaratory in form\"), and this statute specifically, New York\n\nv.

Conversely, compliance may also require major\n\nchanges in air taxi operations, and deferral of review would\n\nclearly threaten hardship.         Cf. Lincoln House, Inc. v.

As to the duty-to-report scenario, we\n\nthink that the FAA's position is plain enough from the language\n\n\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fof its notice,2 especially when read in light of prior statements\n\n(discussed below), and involves a clear-cut pattern of conduct\n\nthat may arise frequently in air taxi operations.                In this\n\nrespect, the notice is well fit for review at this time.\n\n          The     duty-to-be-available     scenario   is    different.\n\nAlthough Aviators has presented a distinct pattern of conduct\n\nlikely to be important to air taxi operations, we find no\n\nsimilar clarity in the notice (see note 2, below), or earlier\n\ninterpretive letters (see note 6, below), to show how the FAA\n\nwould resolve the scenario.      True, one footnote in the FAA's\n\nbrief, and its statements at oral argument, suggest that an\n\nunrequited    duty-to-be-available    is   not   \"rest,\"   but   we   are\n\nunwilling to bind the agency to the less-than-clear litigation\n\nposition of its lawyers in deciding whether a controversy is fit\n\nfor review.     Cf. Bowen v. Georgetown Univ.

The review statute, 49\n\n\n\n     2\n     Pertinently, the FAA notice says that the crewmember must\nbe \"free . . . from present responsibility for work should the\noccasion arise.\"    64 Fed. Reg. 32176, 32176 (1999).        By\ncontrast, in the duty-to-be-available scenario, it is much less\nclear that the crewmember has a \"present responsibility for\nwork\" since the assignment can be declined.\n\n                                -9-\n\fU.S.C.    §   46110    (1994),   imposes     a   sixty-day     time    limit    on\n\npetitions for review unless \"there are reasonable grounds for\n\nnot   filing    by    the   [sixtieth]   day\"    after   the    order,    id.    §\n\n46110(a).      Here, the petition for review (filed August 6, 1999)\n\nis timely as to the notice of enforcement policy (issued June\n\n15, 1999), but comes years after the order adopting the 1985\n\nregulation at issue.          Yet, as we will see, Aviators could be\n\nregarded in some respects as attacking the original regulation.\n\n              If so, this case arguably falls within the proviso of\n\nthe   statute     permitting     a   later   challenge    where       there    are\n\n\"reasonable grounds\" for the delay.3             Here, reasonable grounds\n\nprobably exist for a deferred attack inasmuch as neither the\n\noriginal 1985 regulation nor accompanying commentary eliminated\n\nuncertainty as to how the FAA might resolve any of a number of\n\nscenarios (including the duty-to-report and the duty-to-be-\n\navailable) that might arise in practice.

A period of time during which\n\na pilot has a present responsibility for work, if called, does\n\nnot qualify as a rest period.         This should be contrasted with a\n\npilot who does not have a present responsibility to fly, when\n\ncalled.\"4\n\n              Admittedly, this position, whether in its most recent\n\narticulation        in   the   notice,     or   in   the   FAA's   previous\n\nexplanations, is not as clear as it could be;5 but it is clear\n\nenough.       In fact, there are interpretative statements to the\n\nsame effect preceding 1985.         See, e.g., Letter from A.W. Lalle,\n\nActing Associate General Counsel, FAA, to John F. Nevins, Air\n\nLine       Pilots   Association   (Feb.    5,   1968)   (\"[W]hen   a   flight\n\n\n\n       4\n     See also Letter from Donald P. Byrne, Assistant Chief\nCounsel, FAA, to Frederick G. Pappas, Jr., Director, Flight\nServices, Midwest Corporate Aviation, Inc. (June 24, 1991) (\"[A]\nrest period must be prospective in nature. Stated another way,\na flight crewmember must be told in advance that he or she will\nbe on a rest period for the duration required by the\nregulations.   In addition, a rest period must be free of all\nrestraint.   However, the Agency's interpretations hold that\nreceipt of one telephone call or beeper call does not constitute\na violation of a rest period provision.      Moreover, a flight\ncrewmember in a rest period must be free of present\nresponsibility for work should the occasion arise.\").\n       5\n     Interestingly, \"rest period\" is defined in section\n135.273(a), a different section of the same subpart as the\nregulation at issue, added in 1994 to govern flight attendants\nin air charter operations. 14 C.F.R. § 135.273(a) (2000); 59\nFed. Reg. 42663, 42663 (1994).    It is there defined as \"the\nperiod free of all responsibility for work or duty should the\noccasion arise,\" the very language used in the 1999 notice.\n\n                                    -13-\n\fcrewmember    is   required     by    the    air   carrier   to   hold   himself\n\navailable to call, it constitutes a restraint which interrupts\n\nthe 24-hour period, which we have held should be free from a\n\nloss of freedom or restraint.\").              More important, there is no\n\nevidence that the FAA has ever said that the duty-to-report\n\nscenario did count as rest.             The 1992 FAA bulletin on which\n\nAviators relies, which we have just quoted, actually hurts its\n\n\"reversal\" claim.\n\n            Nor are we troubled by Aviators' argument that the\n\nFAA's   current      position    on    the    duty-to-report       scenario    is\n\ninconsistent with a decision by the Eighth Circuit.

The relevant interpretive\n\n\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fletters appear not merely in tension, but at odds,6 and on this\n\npoint, the 1992 Bulletin is arguably helpful to Aviators.                     See\n\nFlight Standards Information Bulletin 92-02 (\"A period of time\n\nduring which a pilot has a present responsibility for work, if\n\ncalled, does not qualify as a rest period.

But,   as     earlier\n\nexplained, we still do not know for sure how the FAA would\n\nresolve this latter scenario.            3.    This brings us to Aviators'\n\nsubstantive attacks, whether treated as attacks on the notice or\n\non   the   regulation      itself.        Here,    the   FAA   starts     with   a\n\nsubstantial   advantage:          the    question     how   much   rest    flight\n\ncrewmembers should be given to guard against pilot fatigue and\n\nwhat interruptions should count against satisfying the ten-hour\n\nrest requirement are technical issues involving safety where the\n\nagency's latitude is substantial.

And\n\nabsent a mistake of law, the standard of review is whether the\n\nagency's   actions   are   arbitrary   or   capricious,    5   U.S.C.   §\n\n706(2)(a) (1994), and whether any fact findings it made rest on\n\nsubstantial evidence, 49 U.S.C. § 46110(c) (1994).\n\n           Nevertheless, Aviators says that the FAA admits that\n\na brief, unexpected phone call from the carrier does not disturb\n\nrest so as to require the ten-hour clock to be restarted.          See,\n\ne.g., Letter from Donald P. Byrne, Assistant Chief Counsel, FAA,\n\nto Albert C. Pod, Vice President, Executive Jet Management (Apr.\n\n19, 1991).   The FAA verified at oral argument that it has not\n\ndisclaimed that position, and indeed, the language of the 1999\n\nnotice --\"if the flight crewmember . . . had to be available for\n\nthe carrier to notify of a flight assignment\"--arguably would\n\nnot be triggered by an unanticipated phone call.          Aviators says\n\nthat, in light of this concession, it is irrational to deny the\n\n\"rest\" label in the duty-to-report scenario when no call in fact\n\noccurs.\n\n           We do not agree.    The agency is perfectly entitled to\n\nregard a single unexpected phone call as less of a psychological\n\ninterruption to pilot rest than the continuing burden that\n\n\n                                -16-\n\fexists in the duty-to-report scenario even when no call occurs.\n\nIn the latter case, the pilot is effectively on a leash and\n\nknows that at any point (after ten hours) he may be summoned\n\nback to duty, for which he must remain \"fit\" to fly.                    Whether or\n\nnot   the    FAA    has   drawn    the    line    in    the   right    place,   the\n\ndistinction drawn is not irrational.\n\n             Aviators' best claim is that there is no \"explanation\n\nor evidence\" in the record that excluding the duty-to-report\n\ntime from \"rest\" is \"necessary for, or even advances\" safety.\n\nAnd, although the FAA has elsewhere referred to \"scientific\n\nstudies of fatigue,\" Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 60 Fed. Reg.\n\n65951,      65951   (1995),   it    points       to    no   evidence   or   even   a\n\nthoughtful discussion of the specific issue either in the notice\n\nor in the order adopting the 1985 regulation.                         Instead, the\n\nFAA's brief offers an explanation.                To remove the taint of post\n\nhoc rationalization, see State Farm, 463 U.S. at 50; Natural\n\nResources Defense Council v. EPA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"492030\"><a href=\"/opinion/492030/natural-resources-defense-council-inc-conservation-law-foundation-of-new/\"><span class=\"volume\">824</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1258</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1286 & n.19\n\n(1st Cir. 1987), we note that the explanation is pretty obvious;\n\nthe harder question is whether it is sufficient.\n\n             The FAA's commonsense explanation is this:                  given the\n\npurpose of the rest requirement to assure that the flight crew\n\nis refreshed and alert, anything that materially compromises a\n\nstate of affairs conducive to rest threatens refreshment and\n\n\n                                         -17-\n\falertness; and a flight crewmember who is on call and subject to\n\nthe various duties imposed by the duty-to-report scenario is\n\nless likely to be as refreshed and alert as one who need not\n\nworry that a demand to fly may come at any time.                  This is\n\nplausible enough; neither administrators nor judges are expected\n\nto ignore the known realities of human existence.               See, e.g.,\n\nTexas E. Prods. Pipeline Co. v.

In\n\n1949,    the   acting   general   counsel   of    the   Civil     Aviation\n\nAdministration was asked for an interpretation of then-existing\n\n\"relief from all duty\" requirements.             Letter from Robert P.\n\nBoyle, Acting General Counsel, Civil Aviation Administration, to\n\nCoordinator, International Field Office, Lima, Peru (April 22,\n\n1949).   The inquiry presented the following scenario:            \"[An air\n\ncarrier] schedules a 'stand by' crew which must remain at home\n\nsubject to immediate call as replacement in case any of the\n\noriginally scheduled crew are unable, because of sickness, etc.,\n\nto take the trip out as scheduled.       This 'stand by' crew, if not\n\ncalled as a replacement on that day, is then scheduled as a\n\nregular crew for a trip on the following day.\"          Id.\n\n\n                                  -18-\n\f          In response, the acting general counsel ruled:\n\n          This appears to be such a lack of freedom of\n          restraint and release from duty as to\n          prevent the full and free exercise of an\n          opportunity to rest intended by the rest\n          period   provisions   of   the   Civil   Air\n          Regulations.    It is immaterial that the\n          pilots are not required to report to the\n          airport or actively engage in work for the\n          air carrier during the period of the stand\n          by schedule. The term \"relief from duty\" as\n          used in the above-noted section means that\n          the pilot must be relieved from either\n          actual work for the air carrier or present\n          responsibility for such should the occasion\n          arise.   A \"stand by\" schedule of the type\n          described in the memorandum does not provide\n          such relief from all duty with the air\n          carrier.\n\nId.\n\n          Of     course,   without    \"evidence,\"      we    have   no   way    of\n\nknowing just how much these stand-by duties do compromise rest.\n\nBut   agencies     often   make   choices      where        no   evidence      can\n\ndemonstrate a single right answer.

But, of course, Aviators has\n\nnot claimed to have medical studies or expert testimony to show\n\nthat the restrictive reading serves little or no purpose: it\n\nsays only that the FAA has failed to provide supporting evidence\n\nof    its   own.         Perhaps       Aviators          can    develop         compelling\n\nphysiological evidence or collect the testimony of affected\n\npilots to show that duty-to-report time gives pilots as much\n\n\"rest\" as time at home with no overhanging responsibilities.                              If\n\nso, Aviators can file a petition tendering the evidence and\n\nasking the FAA to modify its regulation accordingly.                              5 U.S.C.\n\n§ 553(e) (1994).\n\n            This    is    a    close    case       and    we    have      given    careful\n\nconsideration as to whether a remand might be warranted.                                 But\n\nthe   FAA’s   position        on   duty-to-report           time    is     on     its   face\n\nplausible even without evidentiary support; this position has\n\nbeen consistent over time, even assuming that enforcement has\n\nbeen lax; and there is no indication from Aviators that it could\n\nsupply useful evidence if we did order a remand.                          The FAA should\n\nnot assume that the duty-to-be-available scenario--only a step\n\n\n                                            -20-\n\ffurther   down      the    road    but     a     significant       step   since    the\n\ncrewmember could refuse the assignment--would automatically be\n\nsustainable on the same basis.\n\n            A somewhat different rationale for its narrow view of\n\n\"rest\" seems to be articulated in the FAA's brief in this court\n\nwhich might, if adopted by the agency itself, provide additional\n\nsupport for its position on the duty-to-report scenario and also\n\napply   equally     to     the    duty-to-be-available             scenario.       The\n\nreasoning    does    not    depend        on   the    psychological       burden    of\n\noverhanging      obligations        but    on     the        possible   threat    that\n\nrecalling the flight crewmember to duty after the initial ten\n\nhours of rest could throw off the sleeping rhythms of pilots in\n\nan unacceptable way.7            This concern, which the FAA itself may\n\nnever have articulated, may or may not be substantial, and we\n\nexpress no opinion on the merits.\n\n            Last,    Aviators       says       that     the     FAA's   position    is\n\nunreasonable      and      unfair     because           no     corresponding      rest\n\nrequirements exist for fractional ownership programs, which\n\n\n\n    7 The example given by the FAA brief (slightly corrected) is\nof a pilot who goes off duty at midnight on Monday night, wakes\non Tuesday at 6:30 a.m. and would normally go to sleep again at\n11 p.m. If the pilot is subject to recall on two hours' notice\nafter 10 a.m. on Tuesday, conceivably he could be called at 10\np.m. on Tuesday for a flight at 12:30 a.m. on Wednesday at which\npoint he will have been awake for 18 hours already, unaware that\nsometime during that period he should have gotten some sleep.\n\n                                          -21-\n\fallegedly compete with air taxi carriers but are governed by\n\nPart 91 of the FAA's regulations, 14 C.F.R. 91 (2000).          This\n\nargument has not been well developed in this court; and there\n\nmay be substantive differences in operations that justify the\n\nFAA's   decision   to   regulate   the   two   kinds   of   programs\n\ndifferently.   But the FAA would have some explaining to do if\n\nthe two sets of operations are pertinently the same, especially\n\nif there is a competitive relationship between them.        Cf.

Aviators is free to argue its\n\ncase in those proceedings, and if unsuccessful, it may seek\n\nreview of that agency action under the same statute that enabled\n\nreview in this case, 49 U.S.C. § 46110 (1994), or file a\n\npetition for rulemaking to modify the current regulation         (14\n\nC.F.R. § 135.267(d) (2000)) and spell out then the disparate\n\nimpact claim in greater detail, 5 U.S.C. § 553(e) (1994).\n\n\n\n\n                               -22-\n\f          Accordingly, we sustain the FAA as to the duty-to-\n\nreport scenario and treat as unripe Aviators' claims regarding\n\nthe duty-to-be-available scenario.       With respect to the latter,\n\nAviators is free to seek a formal declaratory ruling from the\n\nFAA and to present its policy arguments and evidence to the\n\nagency.   See 5 U.S.C. § 554(e) (1994).          While the agency has\n\ndiscretion to refuse such a ruling, that refusal is reviewable\n\nfor abuse of discretion, see Intercity Transp. Co. v.
