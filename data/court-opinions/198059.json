WOODWARD,\r\n\n                 Defendant, Appellant.\r\n\n      APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n           FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n    [Hon. Douglas P. Woodlock, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n        Bownes and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\r\n\nBruce A. Singal, with whom William C. Athanas, and Donoghue,\r\nBarrett &amp; Singal, P.C., were on brief for appellant.\r\n\nJohn M. Griffin, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\r\nMark W. Pearlstein, Acting United States Attorney, was on brief for\r\nappellee.\r\n\nJuly 20, 1998\r\n\nBOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.  This case is the sequel to\r\nUnited States v. Sawyer, 85 F.3d 713 (1st Cir. 1996), as we discuss\r\nin detail infra.  Appellant Francis H. Woodward appeals his four-\r\ncount conviction for mail and wire fraud, 18 U.S.C.  1341, 1343;\r\ninterstate travel to commit bribery, 18 U.S.C.  1952 (the \"Travel\r\nAct\"); and conspiracy to commit those offenses, 18 U.S.C.  371. \r\nThe charges stem from his acceptance of illegal gratuities from\r\nWilliam Sawyer and others, with the intent of depriving Woodward's\r\nconstituents of his honest services as a legislator.  In this\r\nappeal, Woodward claims that the evidence was insufficient to\r\nestablish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on any of the four\r\ncounts.  He also argues that the district court erred in certain\r\nevidentiary rulings and in its jury instructions.  We affirm.\r\n                           I\r\n                         Facts\r\nWhen reviewing an appeal from a conviction, we view the\r\nfacts in the light most favorable to the verdict.  United States v.\r\nGonzalez-Maldonado, 115 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir. 1997); Sawyer, 85 F.3d\r\nat 731.  Francis H. Woodward was first elected to the Massachusetts\r\nHouse of Representatives in 1977.  He was assigned to the Joint\r\nCommittee on Insurance (\"Insurance Committee\"), and served as the\r\nCommittee's House Chair from January, 1985 through January 19,\r\n1991.  Beginning January 20, 1991 and continuing through April 1992\r\nwhen he resigned from the legislature, Woodward was assigned to the\r\nTransportation Committee, which had no jurisdiction over insurance\r\nmatters.\r\nDuring the relevant time period, John Hancock Mutual Life\r\nInsurance Company (\"Hancock\") was one of the two largest life\r\ninsurance companies in Massachusetts, and one of the ten largest in\r\nthe entire United States.  Because Hancock is domiciled in\r\nMassachusetts and is regulated primarily at the state level,\r\nMassachusetts' laws and regulations have a major impact on Hancock,\r\naffecting such issues as the corporation's organization and\r\nfunding.  \r\nWilliam Sawyer was the senior legislative counsel in\r\nHancock's Government Relations Department.  He was responsible for\r\nlobbying the Massachusetts legislature on behalf of bills favored\r\nby Hancock and the industry, and against those bills they opposed. \r\nHe actively lobbied the Insurance Committee.\r\nHancock was also a member of an industry trade\r\nassociation known as the Life Insurance Association of\r\nMassachusetts (\"LIAM\").  LIAM also employed lobbyists who worked on\r\nMassachusetts legislation, in coordination with the lobbyists of\r\nits member companies.  Sawyer was an active participant in LIAM as\r\nwell.\r\nBills filed in the Massachusetts legislature were\r\nassigned to committee by subject matter.  The Insurance Committee,\r\ncomprising eleven representatives and six senators, was one of the\r\nprincipal legislative committees to which legislation of interest\r\nto Hancock and LIAM was assigned.  From 1985 through 1990, the\r\nInsurance Committee received, on average, three hundred bills a\r\nyear, one hundred of which affected the life insurance industry. \r\nOf those bills, the industry was interested in passing an average\r\nof only five per year; it opposed the rest. \r\nThe committee's procedures were, in general, as follows. \r\nFirst, public hearings were held on the bills.  Following such\r\nhearings, the members of the committee voted on the bills in\r\nexecutive sessions that were open to the public.  If the bill\r\nreceived a favorable recommendation in the committee's executive\r\nsession, it was reported out favorably for further action on the\r\nfloor of either the House or the Senate.  If it received an\r\nunfavorable recommendation or a study order in the committee's\r\nexecutive session vote, then in all likelihood the bill would not\r\npass in that session.\r\nThe Insurance Committee was co-chaired by one House and\r\none Senate member.  The co-chairs, Woodward and his Senate co-\r\nchair, directed the activities of the committee, supervising the\r\ncommittee staff and scheduling all public hearings, executive\r\nsessions, and meetings.  As co-chair, Woodward had the authority to\r\nassign bills to the hearing calendar and subsequent executive\r\nsessions, and to take other action that would help to advance bills\r\nthrough the committee (or he could choose not to take such action). \r\nWoodward also had the authority to affect the disposition of a\r\nbill, including the ability to \"carry\" a bill through the\r\nlegislative process or to send it to \"study,\" which effectively\r\nshelved it.  \r\nAs one of the four most active lobbyists on behalf of\r\ndomestic life insurance companies, Sawyer was frequently present at\r\nInsurance Committee meetings.  He saw Woodward two or three times\r\na week, and was the lobbyist who met most often with Woodward. \r\nAfter Woodward was removed from the Insurance Committee in January\r\n1991, Sawyer continued to appear at committee meetings and to meet\r\nwith Woodward's successor as House Chair with the same frequency as\r\nhe had before.\r\nAt the heart of the government's case was the evidence of\r\nSawyer's expenditures on Woodward for shared meals and\r\nentertainment.  From 1984 through 1992, Woodward accepted in excess\r\nof $9,000 in gratuities from Hancock and LIAM through their\r\nlobbyists Sawyer and William F. Carroll, the president of LIAM. \r\nHancock provided the majority of this largesse, at least $8,740 in\r\nmeals, rounds of golf, and other entertainment.\r\nThe government introduced evidence showing that, from\r\nMarch 28, 1984 through January 23, 1992, Sawyer expended $8,740 on\r\nbehalf of Woodward.  Of that total, $1,827 was expended after the\r\nstatute of limitations period began, i.e., after July 27, 1990. \r\nOne thousand three hundred forty dollars ($1,340) of the total\r\nexpenditures occurred after January 19, 1991, when Woodward was\r\nremoved from the Insurance Committee.\r\nSawyer's expenditures consisted of (1) shared meals and\r\nentertainment at conferences, generally once or twice a year;\r\n(2) miscellaneous meals and rounds of golf each year in\r\nMassachusetts; (3) a dinner at the annual Fourth of July social\r\ngathering on Cape Cod; and (4) a trip in January 1986 to the Super\r\nBowl in New Orleans.  Expenditures from categories (1) and (2) are\r\nthe subject of this appeal on the sufficiency issue.  The jury\r\nacquitted Woodward as to category (3) expenditures.  Evidence\r\nrelating to the Super Bowl was not the subject of the indictment,\r\nbut was admitted, over Woodward's objection, to show the nature of\r\nthe conspiracy and for its bearing on intent; Woodward appeals the\r\nadmission of that evidence.\r\nThe National Conference of Insurance Legislators (COIL)\r\nis a national association of state legislators involved in\r\ninsurance matters.  Every year the organization sponsored one or\r\nmore conferences for legislators, at various sites around the\r\ncountry, where educational presentations were made concerning\r\ninsurance matters.  Woodward attended many COIL conferences, as did\r\nother legislators from Massachusetts and elsewhere.  Legislators'\r\ntravel and hotel expenses were paid from a legislative account or\r\ncampaign funds but not by the insurance industry.  Woodward and\r\nSawyer frequently played golf at exclusive clubs near the\r\nconference site, and Sawyer generally paid the costs of the golf. \r\nSawyer used his corporate credit card to pay for business-related\r\nexpenses.  He submitted an expense account statement with receipts,\r\nand Hancock reimbursed Sawyer for such expenses.  In addition,\r\nSawyer paid for a number of dinners at local restaurants that would\r\nbe attended by legislators such as Woodward who were attending the\r\nconferences.  At times, William Carroll of LIAM would pay for the\r\ndinners.  Sawyer/Hancock also paid for Woodward's entertainment\r\nwhile at these conferences, such as tickets for the Grand Ole Opry\r\nwhen the conference was in Nashville.\r\nIn addition to the COIL conference expenditures, Sawyer\r\npaid for Woodward's meals at expensive restaurants, as early as\r\n1984, when Woodward was in the Legislature but before Woodward\r\nserved as co-chair of the Insurance Committee.  This practice\r\ncontinued throughout the years Woodward remained in the House, with\r\nhigher amounts generally in the years he was committee chair. \r\nSawyer also paid for an average of three to five golf outings with\r\nWoodward each year at various locations in Massachusetts.  These\r\nwere principally at Sawyer's private golf club, the Woodland Golf\r\nClub.  Hancock also paid for other forms of entertainment,\r\nincluding boat rentals and tickets to tourist attractions such as\r\nBusch Gardens.\r\nThe government introduced into evidence a chart showing\r\nthe amount of annual gratuities accepted by Woodward.  The pattern\r\nformed by these amounts is noteworthy.  In 1984 and 1985, before\r\nWoodward became chair of the Committee and for the first year\r\nafterward, Woodward accepted gratuities in the range of $200-300\r\nfrom Sawyer/Hancock.  In 1986 there was a marked increase to\r\n$2,527, including over $1,800 to cover the air fare, hotel, and\r\ntickets (for him and his wife) to attend the Super Bowl in New\r\nOrleans.  In 1987-91, Woodward received gratuities in the amount of\r\n$1,547, $1,093, $513, $1,230, and $1,324.  Woodward served as\r\ncommittee chair during all but the last of these years.  During his\r\nlast four months in the legislature, January through April 1992, he\r\nreceived only $16, and his gratuities dropped to $0 after he\r\nresigned from office in April.  After Woodward was replaced as\r\ncommittee chair by Rep. Francis Mara, Sawyer began wining and\r\ndining Mara in the same manner as he had Woodward.  Sawyer, 85 F.3d\r\nat 721.\r\nIn addition to Sawyer's payments on behalf of Woodward,\r\nLIAM lobbyists also paid for some of Woodward's meals during the\r\nperiod of the charged conspiracy (1984-92).  These amounted to\r\n$444.\r\nWoodward's official actions, for the most part, conformed\r\nwith the way Sawyer and Hancock wanted the recipient of their\r\ngratuities to conduct himself.  Sawyer was the lobbyist with whom\r\nWoodward met the most, according to Robert J. Smith, the research\r\ndirector for the Insurance Committee.  They met approximately three\r\ntimes a week when the legislature was in session.  And Woodward\r\nrepeatedly acted on behalf of Hancock and the life insurance\r\nindustry in his capacity as co-chair of the Committee.\r\nAccording to Smith, Woodward was the most pro-life-\r\ninsurance-industry chair of the Insurance Committee during Smith's\r\ntenure, 1985-95 (which included six other House and Senate chairs). \r\nWoodward actively supported the industry's position on most bills\r\nof importance to the industry.\r\nAs his defense to the charge that he engaged in illegal\r\ntheft of honest services, Woodward presented evidence that Sawyer's\r\nexpenditures on his behalf were based not on bribery but on their\r\n\"close\" friendship.  In addition to their business relationship,\r\nWoodward and Sawyer maintained a personal relationship.  They met\r\nin the late 1970s, which is the time Woodward began serving on the\r\nInsurance Committee.  The two families socialized together even\r\nbefore Woodward assumed the chair of the Committee in 1984.  The\r\ntwo couples drove together to a conference in New York in 1980, and\r\nthe Sawyers and their children visited the Woodwards at the\r\nlatter's house on Cape Cod as early as 1982.  Beginning in about\r\n1984, the Sawyers would traditionally stay at the Woodwards' house\r\non the Cape for an annual Fourth of July weekend gathering.  The\r\ntwo families also shared other times, including family celebrations\r\nand tragedies.  Mrs. Woodward testified that the Sawyers were one\r\nof three couples with whom the Woodwards were the closest.\r\nThe jury convicted Woodward of four (of the twenty-\r\neight) charges against him:  one count each of mail and wire fraud,\r\none count of interstate travel to commit bribery, and one count of\r\nconspiracy to commit the foregoing three offenses.\r\n                           II\r\n  Requisite Intent Under Mail and Wire Fraud Statutes \r\nTo support a conviction for mail or wire fraud, the\r\ngovernment must prove beyond a reasonable doubt:  \"(1) the\r\ndefendant's knowing and willing participation in a scheme or\r\nartifice to defraud with the specific intent to defraud, and\r\n(2) the use of the mails or interstate wire communications in\r\nfurtherance of the scheme.\"  Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 723; see 18 U.S.C.\r\n1341, 1343.  \"[T]he term 'scheme or artifice to defraud'\r\nincludes a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible\r\nright of honest services.\"  18 U.S.C.  1346; see Sawyer, 85 F.3d\r\nat 723-24.\r\nThe government charged that Woodward engaged in a scheme\r\nto deprive the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and its citizens\r\n(collectively, \"the public\" or \"citizenry\") of their right to his\r\nhonest services as a state legislator, performed free from deceit,\r\nfraud, dishonesty, conflict of interest, and self-enrichment.  In\r\naddition to this general duty of honest services, the government\r\ncharged that Woodward had a specific duty to abide by Massachusetts\r\nreporting requirements.  With regard to the scheme to defraud, the\r\ngovernment charged, inter alia, that Woodward accepted, from\r\nindividuals (including Sawyer) representing Hancock and LIAM, golf,\r\nmeals, tickets, and other entertainment and benefits, in violation\r\nof Massachusetts law; that Woodward filed false Statements of\r\nFinancial Interest (\"SFI\") under oath, in which he unlawfully\r\nfailed to report to the State Ethics Commission his receipt of the\r\ngratuities; that Sawyer on behalf of Hancock and LIAM was given\r\ngreater access to the Insurance Committee and to Woodward as House\r\nChair than was available generally to the citizenry; and that, from\r\n1984 through 1990, Woodward repeatedly performed official acts on\r\nbehalf of Hancock and LIAM.  The government further charged that\r\nWoodward used the mails and interstate telephone wires in\r\nfurtherance of the scheme, in violation of 18 U.S.C.  1341 and\r\n1343.\r\nIn Sawyer, we discussed mail and wire fraud in connection\r\nwith theft of honest services in a closely analogous situation\r\nwhere the same facts formed the backdrop for the case.  We\r\nparticularly highlighted the intent required to support a\r\nconviction; intent is also a major issue in the present case.  But\r\nas Woodward stresses, his situation   as the legislator   is not\r\nexactly identical to that of Sawyer as the lobbyist.  We will,\r\ntherefore, summarize our analysis in Sawyer, insofar as is\r\napplicable here.\r\nWe explained that, prior to Sawyer, honest services fraud\r\nhad typically been found in two types of circumstances: \r\n(1) bribery, where a legislator was paid for a particular decision\r\nor action, or (2) failure to disclose a conflict of interest,\r\nresulting in personal gain.  85 F.3d at 724.  As to the latter, we\r\nnoted that \"[a] public official has an affirmative duty to disclose\r\nmaterial information to the public employer.  When an official\r\nfails to disclose a personal interest in a matter over which she\r\nhas decision-making power, the public is deprived of its right\r\neither to disinterested decision making itself or, as the case may\r\nbe, to full disclosure as to the official's potential motivation.\" \r\nId. (citing United States v. Silvano, 812 F.2d 754, 759 (1st Cir.\r\n1987)).  \"Thus, undisclosed, biased decision making for personal\r\ngain, whether or not tangible loss to the public is shown,\r\nconstitutes a deprivation of honest services.\"  Id.  The Sawyercase expanded category (1) from quid pro quo bribery, to include a\r\nmore generalized pattern of gratuities to coax \"ongoing favorable\r\nofficial action.\"  Id. at 730; see infra.\r\n\"The broad scope of the mail fraud statute, however, does\r\nnot encompass every instance of official misconduct,\" even of\r\n\"reprehensible misconduct,\" \"that results in the official's\r\npersonal gain.\"  Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 725.  The government must prove\r\nthat the defendant intended to deprive the public of its right to\r\nthe honest services of its legislators.  Id. at 725, 730.  \r\nThis intent could be shown in a number of\r\nways.  For example, a bribery-like, corrupt\r\nintent to influence official action\r\nnecessarily is an intent to deprive the public\r\nof an official's honest services.  A person\r\nmight not, however, give an unlawful gratuity\r\nwith the intent to effect a specific quid pro\r\nquo.  Rather, as the government contends here,\r\na person with continuing and long-term\r\ninterests before an official might engage in a\r\npattern of repeated, intentional gratuity\r\noffenses in order to coax ongoing favorable\r\nofficial action in derogation of the public's\r\nright to impartial official services.\r\n\nSawyer, 85 F.3d at 730 (noting that \"[s]uch conduct would be akin\r\nto (although not a classic case of) the conflict of interest cases\r\nnoted\" previously).\r\nApplying this principle to the facts adduced, we stated\r\nthat, \"while Sawyer may not have provided the legislators with\r\ndirect kickbacks or commissions arising out of the specific\r\nofficial action, he may have intended the legislators generally to\r\ntreat preferentially Hancock's interests, knowing that the free\r\nmeals, entertainment, and golf would continue so long as favorable\r\nofficial acts were, at some point, taken.\"  Id.  We reversed the\r\nmail and wire fraud convictions, nevertheless, because we could not\r\nbe sure that the jury convicted Sawyer based upon the Massachusetts\r\ngift statute (as a basis for the federal scheme to defraud) or the\r\nMassachusetts gratuity statute, and the former had been improperly\r\ncharged in the court's instructions to the jury.  We mandated a\r\nprotective instruction to be used in cases such as this, which\r\nwould help the jury understand the difference between\r\n\"reprehensible misconduct\" which is not a violation of federal law,\r\nand misconduct which does form the basis for a federal conviction. \r\nId. at 741.  Noting that prior cases usually involved \"quid pro quo\r\nbribery or blatant conflict of interest,\" which was clearly\r\nillegal, we distinguished Sawyer's gratuities to Woodward (and\r\nother legislators) as involving conduct which \"itself may not be\r\nvery different, except in degree, from routine cultivation of\r\nfriendship in a lobbying context,\" which does not violate federal\r\ncriminal law.  Id.  We noted that \"[t]he practice of using\r\nhospitality, including lavish hospitality, to cultivate business or\r\npolitical relationships is longstanding and pervasive.\"  Id. \r\nBecause the \"difference between lawful and unlawful turns primarily\r\non intent,\" we held that the court must instruct the jury that a\r\nlobbyist does not commit honest services fraud or violate the\r\nTravel Act if his \"intent was limited to the cultivation of\r\nbusiness or political friendship.\"  Id.  He commits those\r\nviolations \"only if instead or in addition, there is an intent to\r\ncause the recipient to alter her official acts.\"  Id.\r\n                          III\r\n              Sufficiency of the Evidence\r\nWoodward's principal argument on appeal is that there was\r\ninsufficient evidence for the jury to find beyond a reasonable\r\ndoubt that he had the requisite intent on any of the four counts at\r\nissue here.  We will focus our discussion here on the mail and wire\r\nfraud counts.  We held in Sawyer that the intent required for a\r\nTravel Act violation is the same as that for mail and wire fraud. \r\n85 F.3d at 741.  Woodward argues that the conspiracy count must\r\nfall because there is insufficient evidence to support the\r\nsubstantive counts that served as its objects.  \r\nBecause theft of honest services constitutes a \"scheme or\r\nartifice to defraud\" within the meaning of the mail and wire fraud\r\nstatutes, see Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 723-24, the question becomes\r\nwhether the jury could reasonably have found that Woodward intended\r\nto steal his honest services from the public.  As Woodward phrased\r\nit in his brief, \"[t]he central question is whether by accepting\r\nhis friend's largesse Woodward intended to be influenced to support\r\nHancock's legislative interests.\"\r\n                           A\r\n                   Standard of Review\r\nIn determining the evidentiary sufficiency of a guilty\r\nverdict, \"the relevant question is whether, after viewing the\r\nevidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, anyrational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of\r\nthe crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"  Jackson v. Virginia, 443\r\nU.S. 307, 319 (1979).  \"The scope of review is over the totality of\r\nthe evidence, both direct and circumstantial.\"  United States v.\r\nCzubinski, 106 F.3d 1069, 1073 (1st Cir. 1997).\r\nWoodward focuses most of his sufficiency challenge on an\r\nalleged lack of intent to be influenced.  He argues that the\r\nevidence was insufficient to show that Woodward accepted Sawyer's\r\ngratuities with the intent to deprive the public of his honest\r\nservices by performing official acts on behalf of Hancock (or the\r\nlife insurance industry).  \r\nWoodward \"bear[s] a heavy burden\" in arguing\r\ninsufficiency of the evidence, even with respect to this intent\r\nelement.  United States v. Biaggi, 853 F.2d 89, 99 (2d Cir. 1988). \r\n\"An appellate court plays a very circumscribed role in gauging the\r\nsufficiency of the evidentiary foundation upon which a criminal\r\nconviction rests.  The court of appeals neither weighs the\r\ncredibility of the witnesses nor attempts to assess whether the\r\nprosecution succeeded in eliminating every possible theory\r\nconsistent with the defendant's innocence.\"  United States v. Noah,\r\n130 F.3d 490, 494 (1st Cir. 1997).  We \"defer, within reason, to\r\ninferences formulated by the jury in the light of its collective\r\nunderstanding of human behavior in the circumstances revealed by\r\nthe evidence.\"  United States v. Guerrero 114 F.3d 332, 339 (1st\r\nCir.) (internal quotation marks omitted), cert. denied sub nom.\r\nPilco v. United States, 118 S. Ct. 184 (1997).\r\nIn reviewing Woodward's contention, \"we must view the\r\nevidence in the light most favorable to the government, crediting\r\nevery inference that could have been drawn in the government's\r\nfavor, and we must affirm the convictions so long as, from the\r\ninferences reasonably drawn, the jury might fairly have found the\r\nrequisite connection beyond a reasonable doubt.\"  Biaggi, 853 F.2d\r\nat 99 (citations omitted); see Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 731.\r\nAs we stated in Sawyer (in the context of intent to\r\ndeceive):\r\nThe evidence need not compel an intent-to-\r\ndeceive finding; rather, it is only required\r\nthat a reasonable jury could be persuaded,\r\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, that [Woodward] had\r\nsuch intent.  And we are mindful that a jury\r\nmay choose among the reasonable alternatives\r\nposed by the evidence.  Finally, the specific\r\nintent to deceive may be proven (and usually\r\nis) by indirect and circumstantial evidence.\r\n\nSawyer, 85 F.3d at 733 (citations omitted).  \r\n\"Despite the deference that characterizes appellate\r\nreview of jury verdicts, juries do not have carte blanche.  The\r\nappellate function . . . requires the reviewing court to take a\r\nhard look at the record and to reject those evidentiary\r\ninterpretations and illations that are unreasonable, insupportable,\r\nor overly speculative.  This function is especially important in\r\ncriminal cases, given the prosecution's obligation to prove every\r\nelement of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\"  United States v.\r\nSpinney, 65 F.3d 231, 234 (1st Cir. 1995) (citations omitted). \r\n\"[A]n appellate court must reverse a conviction on the grounds of\r\nevidentiary insufficiency 'where an equal or nearly equal theory of\r\nguilt[] and a theory of innocence is supported by the evidence\r\nviewed in the light most favorable to the verdict.'\"  Guerrero 114\r\nF. 3d at 344 (quoting United States v. Andujar, 49 F.3d 16, 20 (1st\r\nCir. 1995)).  In such cases, \"a reasonable jury must necessarily\r\nentertain a reasonable doubt.\"  Andujar, 49 F.3d at 20.  Viewed in\r\nthis context, we find that the government has met its burden of\r\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\n                           B\r\n              Intent (Counts 1, 4, 9, 14)\r\nIn Sawyer, we noted two of the ways that a public\r\nofficial can steal his honest services from his public employer: \r\n(1) the official can be influenced or otherwise improperly affected\r\nin the performance of his duties, 85 F.3d at 724, 729; or (2) the\r\nofficial can fail to disclose a conflict of interest, resulting in\r\npersonal gain, id. at 724.  The government asserts that the\r\nevidence supports the jury's finding that Woodward had the\r\nrequisite intent to deprive the public of his honest services in\r\nboth of these ways.  We agree.\r\n            1.  Influence in Official Action\r\nAs Woodward states in his brief, \"the government must\r\n[have] demonstrate[d] that there was sufficient evidence for a\r\nrational jury to conclude that Woodward accepted the free meals and\r\nentertainment from Sawyer with the intent to perform official acts\r\nto favor Hancock's legislative interests.\"  Def. Br. at 19. \r\nIdentical standards apply in determining the \"scheme to defraud\"\r\nelement under the mail and wire fraud statutes.  Czubinski, 106\r\nF.3d at 1076 n.10.\r\n\"The jury was entitled to infer [the defendant's] intent\r\nfrom the circumstances surrounding\" his actions, from indirect, as\r\nopposed to direct, evidence.  United States v. Fulmer, 108 F.3d\r\n1486, 1493 (1st Cir. 1997); see United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d\r\n967, 975 (1st Cir. 1995) (noting that a showing of criminal intent\r\n\"may be made wholly on the basis of circumstantial evidence\").  Nor\r\nare juries \"required to examine the evidence in isolation\";\r\n\"'individual pieces of evidence, insufficient in themselves to\r\nprove a point, may in cumulation prove it.  The sum of an\r\nevidentiary presentation may well be greater than its constituent\r\nparts.'\"  United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 711 (1st Cir. 1992)\r\n(quoting Bourjaily v. United States, 483 U.S. 171, 179-80 (1987));\r\nsee also United States v. Montminy, 936 F.2d 626, 627-28 (1st Cir.\r\n1991).\r\nIn Sawyer, we reviewed much of the same evidence that was\r\npresented to the jury here, and determined that the evidence was\r\nsufficient \"to prove [Sawyer's] intent to influence the\r\nlegislators' official acts.\"  85 F.3d at 731.  We noted that Sawyer\r\ncontinually gave gifts for the purposes of gaining access and\r\ndeveloping a relationship with Woodward and other legislators. \r\nFrom this, the jury could have inferred that Sawyer intended to\r\ninduce official actions favorable to Hancock's interests.  Id.; see\r\nalso id. at 739 (noting that Sawyer gave items of substantial value\r\nto legislators like Woodward who had the ability to take official\r\naction favorable to Hancock, that those gifts ceased after the\r\nlegislators left office, and that Sawyer had long-term ongoing\r\ninterests in official actions and knew the gratuities were illegal;\r\nand concluding that the jury could rationally have inferred that\r\n\"the gratuities were motivated by the legislators' performance of\r\nofficial duties, i.e., that they were given 'for or because of any\r\nofficial act,' within the meaning of the Massachusetts gratuity\r\nstatute, Mass. Gen. L. ch. 268A,  3.\").\r\nThe same inferences regarding Woodward's intent can be\r\ndrawn from the evidence here, based upon the nature and sequences\r\nof events, certain explicit statements, and the suggestions of a\r\ncover-up.  In Sawyer, of course, the jury was assessing the\r\nmotivation of the donor of the gratuity, Sawyer, not that of the\r\ndonee, Woodward.  But it is an equally valid inference, from the\r\nforegoing evidence coupled with the fact that Sawyer and Woodward\r\nspent a good amount of time together, that Woodward understood the\r\ngratuities and their purpose in the same way that his \"close\r\nfriend\" Sawyer did.  Woodward knew that Sawyer was giving him items\r\nof substantial value, continuing over a long period of time; he\r\nknew that Sawyer had a long-term ongoing interest in his official\r\nacts; and that he had the ability to take official action favorable\r\nto Hancock.  Woodward also knew that his relationship with Sawyer\r\nbegan after he became a member of the Insurance Committee and that\r\nthe gifts increased substantially shortly after he became chair of\r\nthe committee that handled insurance legislation.  Finally,\r\nWoodward knew that, at many of the same entertainment events that\r\nhe enjoyed, Sawyer also wined and dined other legislators in a\r\nsimilar manner, and those legislators had only a business\r\nrelationship, not a friendship, with Sawyer.  In light of all this,\r\nthe jury could have inferred that Woodward knew what the deal was \r\nthat the gratuities would continue as long as he voted favorably\r\nto Hancock's interests, see Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 730   and that he\r\nintended to be influenced by the gratuities.\r\nMoreover, the jury had additional evidentiary bases for\r\ndrawing the inference that Woodward's intent included an illegal\r\nelement rather than being solely based on friendship.  After\r\nentertaining Woodward for several days at the Scottsdale COIL\r\nconference in 1991, Sawyer left the conference early, but left his\r\ncredit card to be used for paying Woodward's golf and meal expenses\r\nduring the remainder of the conference.  This is not consistent\r\nwith mere friendship as the sole purpose of the payments, but\r\nrather is more consistent with the theory of a gratuity made\r\nbecause of Woodward's potential official actions.\r\nIn addition, Woodward received some gratuities from\r\nSawyer (although in lesser amounts) at events where other\r\nlegislators   mostly members of the Insurance Committee, who could\r\nalso influence legislative acts in favor of Hancock   were also\r\npresent.  This too indicates an illegal gratuity more than the\r\ncamaraderie of \"close friends.\"  Similarly, some of Woodward's\r\ngratuities came from LIAM, through its president, Carroll, who was\r\nnot a personal friend of Woodward's.\r\nThe same inference can be drawn from the fact that the\r\nexpenditures were not mutual but rather operated in one direction\r\nonly.  The standard operating procedure was for Sawyer to pay for\r\nmeals, drinks and golf for Woodward; Woodward did not make similar\r\npayments for Sawyer.  If the reason Sawyer \"picked up the tab\" for\r\nWoodward on some occasions was simply because the two men were\r\n\"close friends,\" one would expect there to be a roughly equal\r\nnumber of occasions on which Woodward \"picked up the tab\" for\r\nSawyer.  But that was not the case.\r\nIndeed, the only evidence in the record as to Woodward\r\nperforming some reciprocal acts of treating his \"close friend\"\r\nSawyer were the weekends spent on Cape Cod.  On those occasions,\r\nWoodward invited the Sawyers to stay at the Woodward family's house\r\non the Cape, where the Woodwards cooked some meals.  In return,\r\naccording to Woodward, Sawyer would pay for a group dinner at a\r\nnearby restaurant.\r\nSignificantly, the jury returned not guilty verdicts on\r\nall indictments alleging such reciprocal expenditures.  In\r\ncontrast, the jury weighed the evidence differently as to four\r\ncounts charging Woodward with accepting gratuities in a non-mutual,\r\nnon-reciprocal way.  As to these, the jury apparently viewed\r\nSawyer's expenditures and Woodward's acceptance of them as notbeing based on the two men's friendship but rather based on a\r\nbusiness relationship:  i.e., insurance industry lobbyist and Chair\r\nof the Legislature's Insurance Committee.  The jury recognized  \r\nand this recognition is supported by the evidence of record   that\r\nthe two men had two types of relationships, a personal friendship\r\nand a business relationship.  Woodward's acceptance of expenditures\r\nthat were part of their friendship was not illegal, but his\r\nacceptance of expenditures in the context of their business\r\nrelationship constituted theft of the honest services that Woodward\r\nowed to his constituents.  We think the evidence was sufficient for\r\na reasonable juror to so conclude beyond a reasonable doubt.  The\r\njury was free to \"choose among the reasonable alternatives posed by\r\nthe evidence,\" Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 733, and we will not second-guess\r\nthe jury's conclusion in this regard. \r\nAnother reason the jury could have rejected Woodward's\r\ncontention that Sawyer picked up his tab solely because of\r\nfriendship rather than as an attempt to influence is the direct\r\nstatements showing how Woodward expected to receive gratuities from\r\nSawyer (and, through him, from Hancock).  In 1989, at a COIL\r\nconference in Florida, Lorraine Bohannon, the former staff director\r\nof the Insurance Committee, who reported directly to Woodward, went\r\nout to dinner with Woodward, Sawyer, and their spouses.  There is\r\nno evidence that Bohannon had any kind of personal friendship with\r\nSawyer.  After dinner, Bohannon offered to Woodward to pay a\r\nportion of the bill, and Woodward's response was: \"Don't worry\r\nabout it; it's taken care of.\"  Sawyer picked up the tab and was\r\nreimbursed by Hancock for the bill.\r\nThe government presented evidence of another direct\r\nstatement to demonstrate Woodward's illegal intent.  After Woodward\r\nleft the legislature, he expressed interest in working for Hancock\r\nas a lobbyist.  He asked Sawyer to help him obtain the job.  Sawyer\r\ntold Woodward he was not qualified for the job, and Woodward was\r\n\"very hurt.\"  Subsequently when he talked to Committee research\r\ndirector Robert Smith about the Hancock job, Woodward said, in\r\neffect, \"After all I did for Bill Sawyer, you know, I can't believe\r\nhe's not   he can't get me a job\" or \"he's not getting me a job.\" \r\nThe prosecutor asked Smith whether Woodward told him what \"he felt\r\nhe had done for Bill Sawyer,\" and Smith replied, \"Not specifically,\r\njust generally.  'After all these years as Chairman of the\r\ncommittee and trying to do the right thing and being willing to\r\ntake on tough issues, I would   I expected, you know, more\r\nassistance than I received.'\"  \r\nWoodward argues that this conversation does not\r\ndemonstrate any illegal intent on Woodward's part.  He points out\r\nthat, at trial, Smith could not recall Woodward saying \"after all\r\nI've done for Sawyer,\" but only \"after all I've done.\"  Woodward\r\nalso notes that \"trying to do the right thing\" could have meant\r\nfollowing his own conscience, not necessarily doing the \"right\r\nthing\" for Sawyer and Hancock.  Similarly, \"taking on tough issues\"\r\ndid not necessarily mean \"taking on tough issues\" for Sawyer or\r\nHancock.  At trial, Smith testified that he did not interpret these\r\nphrases in an illegal manner.\r\nBut Woodward's argument is belied by the totality of\r\nSmith's testimony about the conversation, or at least a reasonable\r\njury could have so inferred.  In his grand jury testimony, which\r\nwas used by the government at trial, Smith testified to the more\r\ndirectly inculpatory language:  \"after all I did for Bill Sawyer.\" \r\nAnd Smith's trial testimony covered additional incriminating\r\nevidence that Smith had revealed to the grand jury but did not\r\ninclude in his direct testimony at trial.  When asked (at the grand\r\njury session) to repeat the whole conversation, Smith testified:\r\n[Woodward] said that he had spoken to Bill\r\nSawyer and that Bill Sawyer had been reluctant\r\nto help him, and Representative Woodward at\r\nthat time -- as many legislators do, they\r\ndon't remember the specific bill numbers or\r\nsubject matter, but they'll remember in\r\ngeneral if they were favorable towards someone\r\nor not -- said to me \"you would think after\r\nall the years and everything I've done I would\r\nbe treated better than I have been treated.\"\r\n\nThis juxtaposition of the \"everything I've done\" language with the\r\nnotion of legislators \"remember[ing] in general if they were\r\nfavorable towards someone or not\" carries a strong implication\r\nthat, at least in Smith's mind as he heard Woodward make the quoted\r\nstatements, Woodward's reference to \"all he had done\" was meant in\r\nthe sense of taking action in the legislature to favor Sawyer and\r\nHancock's interests.  \r\nSmith's grand jury testimony, elicited after an\r\ninconsistent statement at the trial, constitutes substantive\r\nevidence under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(1)(A).  The jury, in assessing\r\nSmith's credibility in the context of all his testimony, could well\r\nhave believed that Smith's grand jury testimony   with its\r\nincriminating inferences   was true; and the jury could have\r\nconcluded that Smith's trial testimony was not believable to the\r\nextent it undercut the grand jury testimony.  On appeal, of course,\r\nwe view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict,\r\nnot the light most favorable to Woodward.  Credibility assessments\r\nare properly left to the jury.  United States v. Mangual-Corchado,\r\n139 F.3d 34, 43 n.20 (1st Cir. 1998).  And juries are not required\r\nto evaluate the evidence in isolation; \"individual pieces of\r\nevidence, insufficient in themselves to prove a point, may in\r\ncumulation prove it.\"  Bourjaily, 483 U.S. at 179-80.\r\nThe inference of illegal intent grows even stronger when\r\nwe consider another aspect of what Woodward told Smith about his\r\nattempt to persuade Sawyer to help him get a job at Hancock. \r\nAccording to Smith's trial testimony, Woodward said:  \"If he\r\n[Woodward] could not get the job himself he'd like to see his son\r\nBrian get the job.\"  Smith testified that he was unaware of any\r\nexperience that Woodward's son, Brian, had in insurance matters. \r\nThis, too, carries the implication that Woodward was expecting some\r\nkind of reward from Sawyer/Hancock for all his years of favoring\r\nthe industry's position in the legislature.\r\nIn addition, as Woodward recognizes, \"[i]ntent can be\r\ninferred from a defendant's conduct, viewed in light of all the\r\nsurrounding circumstances.\"  Def. Br. at 19; see, e.g., Gaunt v.\r\nUnited States, 184 F.2d 284, 290-91 (1st Cir. 1950).  Thus \"[t]he\r\nbest evidence of Woodward's intent to perform official acts to\r\nfavor Hancock's (and LIAM's) interests is the evidence of\r\nWoodward's actions on bills which were important to Hancock.\"  Id. \r\nUnfortunately for Woodward, the evidence supports the jury's\r\nverdict, rather than undermining it as he contends.\r\nIt is not necessary for the government to link a\r\nparticular gratuity with a specific act in order to obtain a\r\nconviction.  Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 738-39; see discussion supra at\r\np. 13.  Nevertheless, Woodward disputes the extent to which, in his\r\nofficial capacity as chair of the Insurance Committee, he took\r\naction that served the interests of his benefactors.  The evidence\r\ndoes not support his contention.  According to Robert Smith,\r\nWoodward was the most pro-life-insurance-industry chair of the\r\nCommittee, of the seven House and Senate chairs with whom Smith\r\nworked during the ten years that Smith served as the Committee's\r\nresearch director.  Woodward even took pro-industry positions in\r\nopposition to his own committee.  As an example, in each year from\r\n1985 through 1990, the legislature considered a bill proposing\r\nmandatory discounts on life insurance for non-smokers.  Hancock and\r\nLIAM opposed the bill.  In 1989, the bill received favorable\r\nrecommendation from the Insurance Committee based on support from\r\nSenator Linda Melconian, Woodward's co-chair of the Committee.  But\r\ndespite the Committee's favorable report, Woodward led the\r\nopposition to the bill in debate before the full House of\r\nRepresentatives, and was successful in defeating the so-called\r\n\"non-smoker's bill\" for that session.  Hancock's vice-president,\r\nwho directly supervised Sawyer, called the bill's defeat a\r\n\"significant victory for the industry.\"\r\nWoodward also led the Insurance Committee to support and\r\nreport favorably bills proposed by the industry.  Among these were\r\nbills allowing life insurance companies to change the ways in which\r\nthey valued real estate assets, to adjust pension funds, to provide\r\nfinancial services, and to be flexible in corporate governance and\r\nfinance.\r\nIn addition, more than any other co-chair from 1985-95,\r\nWoodward \"carried\" bills sought by the life insurance industry. \r\nThis means that, after the bill left the committee, Woodward served\r\nas the point person to push these bills through the legislative\r\nprocess.\r\nWoodward challenges this characterization of the meaning\r\nof \"carrying\" a bill after it leaves committee.  Woodward contends\r\nthat \"carrying\" is merely a ministerial function, that it simply\r\nrefers to the fact that the chair of any committee of the\r\nMassachusetts legislature \"sign[s] the paperwork recommending a\r\nbill favorably and [is] available to answer questions from non-\r\ncommittee legislators when [the bill is] presented to the House or\r\nSenate floor.\"  Woodward relies on Robert Smith's testimony for the\r\nproposition that carrying legislation does not necessarily mean\r\nadvocating or leading the debate for the bill on the House floor,\r\nthat that role is normally reserved for the legislator who sponsors\r\nthe bill.  \r\nSmith's testimony to this effect, however, was impeached\r\nwith his grand jury testimony in which he had testified that\r\n\"carrying\" meant actively guiding bills through the legislative\r\nprocess.  As we noted in discussing the conversations about getting\r\nWoodward a job at Hancock, the jury was entitled to believe this\r\nportion of Smith's testimony (i.e., introduction at trial of his\r\nprior grand jury testimony)   that \"carrying\" means actively\r\nguiding a bill through the process; it is not merely ministerial  \r\nand the jury was entitled to disbelieve other parts of his trial\r\ntestimony that supported Woodward's interpretation to the contrary. \r\nWoodward points to thirty-one (31) bills that he\r\nsupported despite opposition on the part of Hancock and the\r\ninsurance industry.  But, as the government notes, the proper\r\nanalysis is to examine all bills considered by the Committee in\r\ncontext, not to isolate a relatively small number of bills in an\r\neffort to show that Woodward was not 100% in the industry's pocket. \r\nThe record reflects that, during his six years as co-chair of the\r\nInsurance Committee, there were approximately one hundred bills per\r\nyear that were of interest to the life insurance industry, for a\r\ntotal of six hundred bills during his tenure.  Woodward opposed the\r\nindustry's position on only thirty-one of those bills.  Moreover,\r\nat least ten of the opposed bills were duplicates of previously\r\nfiled bills.  Of the remainder, only three actually related to life\r\ninsurance.  The rest concerned mandated benefits for health\r\ninsurance which were of less importance to the life insurance\r\nindustry, in particular to Hancock.  This is because, as Hancock's\r\nattorney testified, life insurance was Hancock's \"big money earner\r\nin terms of profit.\"  The company's group health insurance business\r\nwas \"[o]ne of the lesser profit earners.\"  As already noted,\r\nseveral of the bills where Woodward's position conformed to the\r\nlife insurance industry's positions were of great importance to the\r\nindustry in that the bills significantly improved the industry's\r\nprofitability.\r\nWoodward relies heavily on Czubinski, 106 F.3d at 1076,\r\nwhere we cited Sawyer for the \"most important[]\" proposition that\r\nthe government must do more than \"merely indicate wrongdoing by a\r\npublic official, but must also demonstrate that the wrongdoing at\r\nissue [was] intended to prevent or call into question the proper or\r\nimpartial performance of that public servant's official duties.\" \r\nCzubinski, 106 F.3d at 1076 (citing Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 725).  In\r\nCzubinski, we explained that Czubinski's \"case falls outside of the\r\ncore of honest services fraud precedents,\" in that he was \"not\r\nbribed or otherwise influenced in any public decisionmaking\r\ncapacity.\"  Id. at 1077.  We also distinguished Czubinski's\r\n\"relatively straightforward\" job   responding to information\r\nrequests from the public   from \"a discretionary, decision-making\r\nrole,\" which \"raise[s] the specter of secretive, self-interested\r\naction.\".  Id.  We found \"no evidence that Congress intended to\r\ncreate what amounts to a draconian personnel regulation,\" by\r\n\"transforming governmental workplace violations into [federal]\r\nfelonies.\"  Id.  \r\nThe instant case is very different from Czubinski.  As\r\nWoodward recognizes, Czubinski did not receive or intend to receive\r\nany tangible benefit from his conduct, whereas Woodward did. \r\nAdditionally, Czubinski's official duties did not involve the\r\ndiscretionary, decision-making role of a legislator. \r\n\"Notwithstanding these factual differences,\" Woodward asserts,\r\n\"Czubinski and the instant case are similarly flawed by the failure\r\nof proof on the critical fraudulent intent element.\"  We disagree. \r\nAs discussed supra, the jury in the present case could justifiably\r\nhave inferred the fraudulent intent element.  Woodward did receive\r\ntangible benefits here, as Czubinski had not.  And the connection\r\nbetween the gratuities and Woodward's official acts could have been\r\njustifiably inferred from the fact that Woodward had discretion to\r\nact or not act in ways that would further the insurance industry's\r\ninterests; this discretion extended both to the bottom line\r\n(support of or opposition to the industry's position on\r\nlegislation) and to the degree of vigor with which Woodward\r\nchampioned the industry's positions.\r\n     2.  Failure to Disclose Conflicts of Interest\r\nIn addition to demonstrating Woodward's intent by\r\nevidence showing that he was influenced or otherwise improperly\r\naffected in performing his duties, the government argues that\r\nWoodward's intent is also demonstrated by his failure to disclose\r\nhis conflict of interest although he was required to do so.  We\r\nagree. \r\nMassachusetts law mandates such disclosure on his\r\nStatements of Financial Interest (SFIs).  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 268B,\r\n5 (West 1990).  In addition, separate and apart from the state\r\nstatute, \"[t]he obligation to disclose material information inheres\r\nin the legislator's general fiduciary duty to the public.\"  Sawyer,\r\n85 F.3d at 733 n.17.  We recognized in Sawyer that the non-\r\ndisclosure of a conflict of interest is a second way in which a\r\npublic official can steal his honest services.  85 F.3d at 724; cf.id. at 728 (\"[U]nlike the honest services fraud cases, noted above,\r\nin which an official was bribed or took official action based on a\r\nsecret conflict of interest, a gift statute violation, even if\r\nintentional, does not itself amount to honest services fraud.\" \r\n(Emphasis added)).  The evidence of Woodward's non-disclosure is\r\nalso probative of Woodward's intent; it supports the jury's finding\r\nthat he had the requisite intent.\r\nAs we stated in Sawyer:\r\nA public official has an affirmative duty to\r\ndisclose material information to the public\r\nemployer.  When an official fails to disclose\r\na personal interest in a matter over which she\r\nhas decision-making power, the public is\r\ndeprived of its right either to disinterested\r\ndecision making itself or, as the case may be,\r\nto full disclosure as to the official's\r\npotential motivation behind an official act.\r\n\nSawyer, 85 F.3d at 724 (citing Silvano, 812 F.2d at 759).\r\nIn addition to the general \"affirmative duty to disclose\"\r\ndiscussed in Sawyer, Woodward had a specific statutory duty each\r\nyear to file a Statement of Financial Interests with the\r\nMassachusetts State Ethics Commission.  See Mass. Gen. Laws\r\nch. 268B,  5.  Woodward was required to disclose on his SFI forms\r\nall gifts he or his immediate family received, aggregating more\r\nthan $100 per year, from lobbyists or businesses that had a direct\r\ninterest in legislation.  He had to sign the forms under oath. \r\nWoodward did not report the gratuities he received from Hancock or\r\nLIAM on any of his SFI forms submitted for the years 1984 through\r\n1992.\r\nWoodward contends that his failure to comply with the\r\nMassachusetts reporting statute, while \"reprehensible,\" is not\r\nrelevant here.  We disagree.  In Czubinski, we listed \"the failure\r\nof public decision-makers to disclose certain conflicts of\r\ninterest\" as one of three examples of \"serious corruption\" on the\r\npart of public officials that would \"typically\" justify an honest\r\nservices conviction.  106 F.3d at 1076.  Woodward's failure to\r\nreport supports the implication that Woodward was aware that these\r\ngratuities were improper, especially in light of the fact that\r\n\"[m]uch of his entertainment . . . took place out-of-state --\r\nusually at industry and legislative conferences -- where members of\r\nthe Massachusetts citizenry generally would not observe the\r\nquestionable activities.\"  Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 733.  Woodward had\r\nevery incentive to keep these \"questionable activities\" secret from\r\nthe public by not disclosing them on his SFIs.  The SFIs are public\r\ndocuments, which are frequently scrutinized by the press and\r\npolitical opponents during election years.  In fact, the only gift\r\nWoodward ever reported was a local, public golf tournament\r\nsponsored by Massachusetts Candy &amp; Tobacco Distributors, Inc.,\r\nwhich he reported after learning that the tournament was under\r\ninvestigation by the State Ethics Commission.  \r\nWe agree with the government that Woodward's intentional\r\nfailure to disclose the Hancock and LIAM gifts in itself provides\r\na solid basis for the jury to find that Woodward had the requisite\r\nintent to deprive the public of his honest services.  This same\r\nevidence also supports the finding that Woodward had the intent to\r\ndeceive necessary for a mail and wire fraud conviction.  See supraat 13, n.6.  \"[A]n official's intentional violation of the duty to\r\ndisclose provides the requisite 'deceit.'\"  Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 732\r\n(quoting Silvano, 812 F.2d at 760).\r\nViewing the record in the light most favorable to the\r\nverdict, a rational jury could have found the requisite intent from\r\nthe trial evidence.  The evidence was sufficient for a rational\r\njuror to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Woodward accepted\r\ngratuities from Sawyer with the intent to defraud the public of its\r\nright to his honest services, and that he had the specific intent\r\nto deceive.  See also Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 742 (finding that the\r\nevidence adduced there \"would be adequate to infer improper\r\nintent\").\r\n                           C\r\n         Other Elements of Wire Fraud (Count 9)\r\nAs noted supra, to support a conviction for mail or wire\r\nfraud, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt: \r\n\"(1) the defendant's knowing and willing participation in a scheme\r\nor artifice to defraud with the specific intent to defraud, and\r\n(2) the use of the mails or interstate wire communications in\r\nfurtherance of the scheme.\"  Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 723; see 18 U.S.C.\r\n1341, 1343.  \r\nWoodward also challenges his convictions based on the\r\nsecond requirement.  He argues that the government offered\r\ninsufficient evidence to prove either that Woodward caused the\r\nwiring or that the wiring was \"for the purpose of executing [the]\r\nscheme\" to defraud.  See 18 U.S.C.  1343.\r\nThe wire fraud count relates to a COIL conference in\r\nOrlando, Florida, in November, 1990.  The indictment alleged that\r\non November 21, 1990, a call was placed from Boston, Massachusetts,\r\nto Lake Buena Vista, Florida, and that its purpose involved\r\n\"[a]rrangements related to entertainment in Florida.\"  \r\nWoodward claims that he did not \"cause\" this telephone\r\ncall to be made, and that it was not made for the purpose of\r\nexecuting a scheme for Woodward to defraud the public of its right\r\nto his honest services.  We disagree on both points.  As we stated\r\nin Sawyer, Woodward \"'need not personally use the wires as long as\r\nsuch use was a reasonably foreseeable part of the scheme in which\r\n[he] participated.'\"  85 F.3d at 723 n.6 (quoting United States v.\r\nBoots, 80 F.3d 580, 585 n.8 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct.\r\n263 (1996)).  In addition, \"[t]he use of the mails or wires to\r\nfurther the fraudulent scheme need only be 'incidental.'\"  Id.(quoting United States v. Grandmaison, 77 F.3d 555, 566 (1st Cir.\r\n1996)). \r\nHere, Woodward concedes that the jury could reasonably\r\nhave inferred from the evidence that Hancock's Functions\r\nCoordinator called the Florida hotel on or about November 21, 1990,\r\nfor the purpose of reserving a room, so Sawyer could attend the\r\nCOIL conference in Orlando.  Nevertheless, Woodward claims that he\r\ncould not have reasonably foreseen that a Hancock employee would\r\nmake a room reservation for Sawyer at this COIL conference, nor\r\nthat she would use the telephone to do so.  According to Woodward,\r\nSawyer's \"presence [at the conference] could have been ensured by\r\nmany means other than the fortuity of an interstate telephone call\r\nto reserve his hotel room.\"  We disagree.\r\nWoodward knew full well that Sawyer would need a hotel\r\nroom in Florida for the COIL conference, and that Sawyer's office\r\nwas located in Massachusetts.  Woodward could reasonably have\r\nforeseen that the hotel reservations in Florida would be made by\r\nphone either by Sawyer or by someone acting on his behalf.  That\r\nSawyer could conceivably have made his room reservation in person\r\nor by mail does not undermine the foreseeability of a telephone\r\ncall.  The jury was entitled to use its common sense to infer that\r\na reasonable person would have foreseen a telephonic reservation,\r\nas a means commonly employed in the business world for transactions\r\nof this type.  Thus, the jury was entitled to conclude, based on\r\nthe evidence presented, that Woodward \"caused\" the wiring.\r\nWoodward further argues that \"the evidence presented was\r\ninsufficient to show that the purpose of this call was to execute\r\na scheme by Woodward to deprive the public of its right to his\r\nhonest services by receiving gratuities from Sawyer with the intent\r\nto favor unlawfully Hancock's legislative interests.\"  Def. Br. at\r\n27.  We disagree.  The jury could reasonably have concluded that\r\nthe call was made in furtherance of the scheme to defraud.  Sawyer\r\nwould not have been able to give Woodward the illegal gratuities\r\nduring the COIL conference if Sawyer did not have a hotel room in\r\nwhich to stay for the four days of the conference.  The call in\r\nquestion secured that room, and thus played an essential role in\r\nthe scheme.\r\nOur conclusion is buttressed by decisions involving mail\r\nfraud, which is analogous to wire fraud for these purposes.  The\r\nfocus of our inquiry on this question \"ought to be concerned less\r\nwith the precise contents of the particular mailings than with the\r\nrole those mailings played in the execution of the scheme to\r\ndefraud.\"  United States v. Serino, 835 F.2d 924, 928 (1st Cir.\r\n1987).  In Silvano, we upheld a mail fraud conviction of government\r\nofficials, where the defendants neither placed nor received any of\r\nthe mailings.  (The mailings consisted of the payment of premiums\r\nand commissions, all incidental to, but related to, commission of\r\nthe fraud.)  We held that these mailings were sufficiently in\r\nfurtherance of the fraud.  812 F.2d at 760.  We reasoned that \"the\r\nfederal mail fraud statute sweeps broadly and its prohibitions\r\nextend to the use of the mails by corrupt local government\r\nofficials.  It is similarly settled that use of the mails need be\r\nno more central to the illegal scheme than were the mailings\r\nsupporting the counts upon which [the defendants] were convicted.\" \r\nId.\r\nThe evidence was sufficient to support Woodward's wire\r\nfraud conviction.\r\n                           D\r\n                  Mail Fraud (Count 4)\r\nWith respect to the mail fraud count, Woodward concedes\r\nthat, \"because the evidence showed he was at events for which\r\nSawyer paid with his credit card, it was reasonably foreseeable to\r\nhim that Sawyer would be billed by mail for these credit card\r\nexpenditures on his behalf.\"  Def. Br. at 28.  Therefore he does\r\nnot contest the fact that he \"may be said to have 'caused' the\r\nmailing alleged in Count 4 when he let Sawyer pick up the tab.\" \r\nId.\r\nBut he contends that \"the purpose of the mailing strays\r\nfar from the execution of a scheme by Woodward to defraud the\r\npublic.\"  Id. at 29.  He argues that the scheme had already reached\r\nfruition by the time the mails were used.  He points to United\r\nStates v. Maze, 414 U.S. 395 (1974), where the Supreme Court noted\r\nthat \"Congress could have drafted the mail fraud statute so as to\r\nrequire only that the mails be in fact used as a result of the\r\nfraudulent scheme.  But it did not do this; instead, it required\r\nthat the use of the mail be 'for the purpose of executing such\r\nscheme or artifice.'\"  Id. at 405 (footnote omitted) (emphasis\r\nadded).  \r\nIn the present case, the mailing in question was sent by\r\nCitibank Visa to Sawyer, billing him for charges arising from\r\nSawyer's use of his Visa card to pay for illegal gratuities given\r\nto Woodward.  According to Woodward, because the mailing took place\r\nsome three to four weeks after Sawyer purchased the meals and\r\nentertainment for Woodward, the use of the mail was \"a result of\"\r\nthe fraudulent scheme but not \"for the purpose of executing\" the\r\nscheme.  Id.  We disagree.\r\nWoodward's argument focuses too narrowly, on each\r\ngratuity individually.  His contention assumes a new fraudulent\r\nscheme began and ended every time Sawyer used his credit card to\r\npick up the tab for Woodward.  On the contrary, the evidence\r\nsupported the conclusion that the fraudulent scheme in which\r\nWoodward and Sawyer participated was an ongoing scheme, lasting for\r\nyears and involving Sawyer's use of his credit card.  Every month,\r\nVisa would use the mails to bill Sawyer for his charges; if Sawyer\r\ndid not pay those bills, his credit line would have been terminated\r\nand the gratuities could not have continued as Woodward and Sawyer\r\nexpected.  It was thus a necessary part of the ongoing scheme that\r\nSawyer pay his bill after receiving it in the mail.  See Sawyer, 85\r\nF.3d at 730 (\"[A] person with continuing and long-term interests\r\nbefore an official might engage in a pattern of repeated,\r\nintentional gratuity offenses in order to coax ongoing favorable\r\nofficial action in derogation of the public's right to impartial\r\nofficial services.\")  This case is therefore distinguishable from\r\nMaze, where the mailing involved only a post-fraud accounting among\r\nvictims, after the defendant's fraudulent use of credit cards was\r\nalready completed.  See Maze, 414 U.S. at 402; Schmuck v. United\r\nStates, 489 U.S. 705, 714 (1989) (distinguishing and limiting Mazeto cases in which the fraudulent scheme has come to fruition).\r\nWoodward cursorily argues that the wiring and mailing are\r\nmerely \"a pretext to manufacture federal jurisdiction over a local\r\noffense.\"  Def. Br. at 30 (mail fraud); see id. at 28 (wire fraud). \r\nWe have already rejected such a federalism claim:  \"Congress may\r\nprotect the integrity of the interstate mails and wires by\r\nforbidding their use in furtherance of schemes to defraud a state\r\nand its citizens, whether or not it can forbid the scheme itself.\" \r\nSawyer, 85 F.3d at 722-23 (citations omitted).\r\nThe evidence was sufficient to support the mail fraud\r\nconviction.\r\n                           E\r\n                 Travel Act (Count 14)\r\nThe elements of a Travel Act violation include: \r\n(1) interstate travel or the use of an interstate facility;\r\n(2) with the intent to promote, manage, establish, carry on, or\r\nfacilitate an unlawful activity (here, violation of the\r\nMassachusetts gratuity statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 268A,  3 (West\r\n1990); and (3) followed by performance or attempted performance of\r\nacts in furtherance of the unlawful activity.  See 18 U.S.C.\r\n1952; United States v. Arruda, 715 F.2d 671, 681 (1st Cir. 1983).\r\nWoodward argues that the evidence supporting the Travel\r\nAct conviction was deficient in four respects.  First, he argues\r\nthat the evidence was insufficient to establish the requisite\r\ncriminal intent to violate 18 U.S.C.  1952.  We disagree, for the\r\nsame reasons discussed in Part III(B), supra, in relation to his\r\nintent under the mail and wire fraud statutes.  See Sawyer, 85 F.3d\r\nat 741 (equating intent requirements of mail and wire fraud\r\nstatutes with that required under Travel Act).\r\nSecond, Woodward maintains that, in order to prove a\r\nviolation of the Travel Act, the government had to prove that\r\nWoodward violated the bribery laws of Florida.  The Travel Act\r\npunishes traveling in interstate commerce for the purpose of\r\ncarrying on any unlawful activity; such activity encompasses the\r\ncommission of bribery \"in violation of the laws of the state in\r\nwhich committed or of the United States.\"  18 U.S.C.  1952(b)(2). \r\nThe indictment incorporates the Massachusetts gratuity statute,\r\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 268A,  3, as the underlying bribery offense. \r\nWoodward contends that the bribery, if any, took place only in\r\nFlorida, and therefore, without evidence of any Florida bribery\r\nstatute, the Travel Act conviction must be reversed.  This argument\r\nis unavailing.\r\nThe Travel Act \"does not require the government to prove\r\nthat the alleged 'unlawful activity' violates the laws of the state\r\nultimately traveled to,\" or of the state where money actually\r\nchanged hands.  United States v. Walsh, 700 F.2d 846, 854-55 (2d\r\nCir. 1983) (mayor of city in New Jersey agreed in New Jersey to\r\naccept bribe and traveled to New York to collect it); see United\r\nStates v. Jones, 642 F.2d 909, 913 (5th Cir. 1981).  A conviction\r\nmay be sustained where the evidence demonstrates \"unlawful\r\nactivity\" in violation of the laws of the state where the effects\r\nof the fraudulent scheme are felt, in this case, the state whose\r\ncitizens are defrauded of their legislator's honest services.  SeeWalsh, 700 F.2d at 854-55.  Here, Woodward is a legislator from\r\nMassachusetts, and the jury could have concluded that the gratuity,\r\nthough paid in Florida, was paid for the purpose of influencing\r\nlegislative activities in and affecting Massachusetts.  As we\r\ndiscuss below, that is sufficient.\r\nWoodward's third challenge to his Travel Act conviction\r\ninvolves timing.  He asserts that there was no evidence that\r\nWoodward performed any acts in furtherance of the unlawful activity\r\nafter the interstate travel on November 24, 1990, as alleged in the\r\nindictment.  Woodward notes that, although the Travel Act requires\r\nsuch, the Massachusetts gratuity statute does not require any\r\nsubsequent activity to be taken in Massachusetts after the Florida\r\nbribe.  As evidence of Woodward's post-gratuity activity, the\r\ngovernment points to Woodward's action with respect to S. 641,\r\nwhich proposed premium reductions in life insurance for\r\npolicyholders who were non-smokers.  The bill was originally\r\nreported favorably out of the Insurance Committee on May 7, 1990. \r\nThen on July 24, 1990, just before becoming law, the House of\r\nRepresentatives recommitted the bill to the Insurance Committee.\r\nThe effect of a bill's recommittal is that both chairs would have\r\nto act in order for the bill to be released.  The bill languished\r\nin the Insurance Committee with no further action taken through\r\nJanuary 1, 1991, after Woodward received the Florida gratuities and\r\nprior to his removal as co-chair.  Woodward's co-chair, Senator\r\nMelconian, had actively supported the 1989 bill by requesting a\r\nfavorable recommendation from the Insurance Committee.  The jury\r\ncould, therefore, reasonably have inferred that Woodward prevented\r\nany further action on S. 641, because in the previous year he led\r\nthe floor debate, on behalf of Hancock and LIAM, against a similar\r\nnon-smokers bill.\r\nWoodward's receipt of the gratuities in Florida and the\r\nsubsequent recommittal of S. 641 through January 1991 provided\r\nsufficient evidence to allow the jury to find that Woodward\r\nperformed an act in furtherance of the unlawful activity after the\r\ntravel to Florida on November 24, 1990.  Arruda, 715 F.2d at 682. \r\nWoodward's timing argument thus fails.\r\nWoodward's fourth argument against his Travel Act\r\nconviction is that \"the payment of the 'bribe' in Florida\" has such\r\nan \"attenuated relationship to Massachusetts\" that it would violate\r\nthe \"effects doctrine.\"  Def. Br. at 32.  \"Under this doctrine, a\r\nsovereign only possesses jurisdiction to prosecute a crime where,\r\ninter alia, 'the effect within the territory is substantial.'\" \r\nId. (quoting Commonwealth v. Beneficial Fin. Corp., 275 N.E.2d 33,\r\n57 n.8 (1971)).  Because acts that might otherwise be \"gratuities\"\r\ncould be performed out-of-state without any corresponding \"effect\"\r\nin Massachusetts, Woodward maintains that Massachusetts would lack\r\njurisdiction to prosecute purely out-of-state expenditures.  Def.\r\nBr. at 32 (citing Heath v. Jones, 941 F.2d 1126, 1139 (11th Cir.\r\n1991) (no due process violation when state prosecutes crime that\r\nstarted within its borders and concluded in another state);\r\nCommonwealth v. Levin, 417 N.E.2d 440, 451 (Mass. App. Ct. 1981)\r\n(state may prosecute acts performed outside of its jurisdiction\r\nwhere acts are intended to produce and actually produce detrimental\r\neffects within the state)).\r\nWoodward asserts that the government failed to produce\r\nany evidence of detrimental effect actually resulting from the out-\r\nof-state expenditures; the \"mere possibility of future action\r\nfavorable to Hancock is not an 'effect,' let alone one that is\r\n'substantial.'  Nor would alteration of official acts be the\r\n'direct' or 'foreseeable' result of lobbyists entertaining\r\nlegislators at out-of-state conferences.\"  Def. Br. at 33 (citing\r\nSawyer, 85 F.3d at 741).  We disagree.\r\n The Massachusetts gratuity statute prohibits public\r\nemployees from receiving \"anything of substantial value . . . for\r\nor because of any official act . . . performed or to be performed\r\nby him.\"  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 268A,  3.  \"The concern behind the\r\ngratuity statute, like the bribery statute, is the potentialundermining of official integrity.\"  Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 735\r\n(emphasis added).  Indeed, when someone gives a stream of illegal\r\ngratuities to a public official, a sense of being beholden to the\r\ngiver's interests is exactly the kind of influence that the giver\r\nis trying to develop.  See id. at 730.  The potential effect on\r\nMassachusetts when one of its own legislators accepts gratuities\r\nout-of-state paid by someone with an interest in Massachusetts\r\nlegislation is a sufficient nexus to satisfy the effects test and\r\ngive Massachusetts jurisdiction to prohibit such conduct. \r\nBesides this potential effect, of course, Woodward's\r\nreceipt of gratuities in Florida was linked also to his official\r\nacts in Massachusetts.  Among these acts is his recommittal of a\r\nparticular bill, Senate Bill 641 (S. 641), shortly after he\r\nreturned from Florida, as already discussed.  And they also\r\nincluded his prior acts to champion the insurance industry's\r\npositions in the Legislature.  Woodward violated the Massachusetts\r\ngratuity statute, a prerequisite for his Travel Act violation,\r\nbecause he received something of \"substantial value . . . for or\r\nbecause of any official act . . . performed or to be performed by\r\nhim.\"  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 268A,  3.  We have already discussed\r\nour view that the evidence was sufficient to establish the linkage\r\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.  \r\nWoodward's Florida gratuity was closely enough related to\r\nMassachusetts that his \"effects doctrine\" argument must fail.  SeeStrassheim, 221 U.S. at 284-85 (holding that, when an individual's\r\ncriminal acts were intended to and did produce detrimental effects\r\nwithin a state, the state may prosecute that individual even if he\r\ncommits the act in another jurisdiction; applying this rule to an\r\nattempt to bribe a Michigan official who was in charge of making\r\nstate purchases, even though defendant never entered Michigan);\r\nHeath, 941 F.2d at 1138-39.  As the district court noted, to hold\r\notherwise would \"be at odds with the idea of official bribery or\r\ncorruption . . . .  [It would] provide a series of safe havens for\r\nthose who wish to be bribed or [to be] the recipients of\r\ngratuities.  [It would be] at odds with the statute itself [and]\r\nwith the larger purposes of the Travel Act.\"\r\n                           F\r\n                  Conspiracy (Count 1)\r\nIn order to convict Woodward of conspiracy, the\r\ngovernment had to prove that a conspiracy existed, that Woodward\r\nknew of and voluntarily participated in it, and that an overt act\r\ntook place in furtherance of it.  See United States v. Frankhauser,\r\n80 F.3d 641, 653 (1st Cir. 1996).  The agreement need not be\r\nexplicit; a tacit agreement will suffice.  See id.; Direct Sales\r\nCo. v. United States, 319 U.S. 703, 712-13 (1943).  To establish\r\nWoodward's voluntary participation in the conspiracy, the evidence\r\nmust establish both his intent to agree and his intent to\r\neffectuate the object of the conspiracy.  Frankhauser, 80 F.3d at\r\n653; see also United States v. Piper, 35 F.3d 611, 615 (1st Cir.\r\n1994).  Neither the agreement nor Woodward's participation in it\r\nneed be proven with direct evidence.  See Glasser v. United States,\r\n315 U.S. 60, 80 (1942); Frankhauser, 80 F.3d at 653. \r\nWoodward's challenge to his conspiracy conviction is that\r\nit depends on the three substantive counts on which he was\r\nconvicted, and he maintains that those counts suffered from\r\nsufficiency of the evidence infirmities that compel acquittal. \r\n\"Because these infirmities extend to the conspiracy count,\" he\r\nargues, \"Count 1 must fall for the same reasons as the three\r\nsubstantive counts of which it is comprised.\"  Def. Br. at 34.\r\nWoodward's argument is unavailing, because we have\r\nconcluded that none of the three substantive counts comprising the\r\nconspiracy count was infirm.  Therefore, the evidence is sufficient\r\nto support the conspiracy conviction for the same reasons discussed\r\nsupra concerning the substantive counts, and Woodward's conspiracy\r\nconviction must stand.\r\nBased on the evidence in this record, we conclude that a\r\nreasonable jury could have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that\r\nWoodward committed all elements of the four offenses of which he\r\nwas convicted.\r\n                          III\r\n                   Jury Instructions\r\nWoodward contends that the district court erred in\r\ninstructing the jury as to the intent necessary to support a\r\nconviction, contrary to our decision in Sawyer.  Such a challenge\r\nto the jury instructions presents legal issues which we review de\r\nnovo.  United States v. Phath, 1998 WL 244746, at *2 (1st Cir.\r\nMay 20, 1998); United States v. Pitrone, 115 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.\r\n1997) (When the alleged error involves the instructions' adequacy\r\nin explaining the law, such as \"interpretation of the elements of\r\na statutory offense, it poses a question of law and sparks plenary\r\nreview.\"); United States v. Fulmer, 108 F.3d 1486, 1494 (1st Cir.\r\n1997).  We must look at the entire charge, in light of the\r\nevidence, and determine whether, taken as a whole, the court's\r\ninstructions \"fairly and adequately submit[ted] the issues in the\r\ncase to the jury,\" United States v. Cassiere, 4 F.3d 1006, 1022\r\n(1st Cir. 1993) (internal quotation marks omitted), or whether they\r\n\"tended to confuse or mislead the jury\" as to the applicable\r\nprinciples of law, Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 726 (internal quotation marks\r\nomitted); see Fulmer, 108 F.3d at 1494.\r\nThe district court is not obligated to \"follow the exact\r\nform and wording of the defendant's proposed instructions.\"  United\r\nStates v. Gibson, 726 F.2d 869, 874 (1st Cir. 1984); Lawrence v.\r\nGulf Oil Corp., 375 F.2d 427, 429 (3d Cir. 1967).  Rather, \"[t]he\r\ntrial court has considerable latitude in charging the jury,\" so\r\nlong as the charge as a whole fairly and adequately limns the law\r\napplicable to the controlling issues.  Cassiere, 4 F.3d at 1022\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted).  That latitude is not\r\nunlimited, however.  Clear, accurate, easily understood jury\r\ninstructions are \"vitally important in assuring that jurors grasp\r\nsubtle or highly nuanced legal concepts.\"  United States v.\r\nDeStefano, 59 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1995).  In Sawyer, in order to\r\nprotect a defendant from being convicted based on conduct that was\r\nnot actually illegal, we reversed the conviction and mandated a\r\nprotective instruction in cases such as this one.  \r\nIn the present case, Woodward challenges the district\r\ncourt's instruction on the issue that the court and the parties\r\nreferred to as the issue of \"mixed motive.\"  Proof of motive is\r\nnot an element of the offenses.  The phrase \"mixed motive\" was\r\napparently meant as shorthand for the dual intent that might be\r\nsupportable by the evidence in this case:  the jury could have\r\nconcluded (1) that Woodward accepted expenditures based on his\r\nlegitimate friendship with Sawyer, or (2) that these were unlawful\r\nexpenditures to influence official action (or some combination of\r\nthe two).\r\nWoodward argues that our decision in Sawyer intended to\r\ndraw a bright line between \"the merely unattractive and actual\r\ncriminal conduct.\"  Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 741.  On one side of the\r\nline, according to Woodward, is conduct that is \"unattractive\" or\r\neven \"reprehensible\" but is not illegal as a matter of federal\r\ncriminal law.  This would include lavish hospitality if intended to\r\ncultivate business or political relationships or friendships.  On\r\nthe other side of the line is illegal expenditures, i.e., those by\r\nlobbyists intended \"to cause the recipient to alter her official\r\nacts.\"  Id.  According to Woodward, Sawyer presented this analysis\r\n\"largely in stark 'either-or' terms.\"  Def. Br. at 35.  He claims\r\nto have premised \"the core\" of his defense on this \"bright line\"\r\ndistinction, attempting to persuade the jury that Woodward and\r\nSawyer's relationship should be found \"to fall on the 'friendship'\r\nside of the line,\" because of the family friendship and the social\r\nnature of the functions at which the expenditures were made.  Id.at 38.\r\nWoodward's theory of the case is flawed, based on a\r\nmisreading of our decision in Sawyer.  Relationships among human\r\nbeings, especially among lobbyists and elected officials, will\r\nfrequently not follow a bright-line pattern, falling on one side or\r\nthe other of some magical wall dividing friendship from attempts at\r\nundue influence.  A lobbyist and legislator may initially have an\r\nexclusively business relationship when they first meet, but if it\r\ncontinues over time, given the nature of the lobbying business with\r\nits sometimes \"lavish hospitality,\" Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 741, the\r\nindividuals involved may eventually get to know each other, and\r\nsome may be able to claim, with some truth, that their relationship\r\nhas become one of friendship.  We did not imply anything different\r\nin Sawyer, and we certainly did not state or imply what Woodward's\r\ntheory seems to entail:  that the formation of a friendship between\r\na lobbyist and a legislator somehow insulates both from prosecution\r\nfor honest services fraud.\r\nA look at Sawyer's language illustrates Woodward's error. \r\nWe stated:  \"[I]f the aim of the lobbyist were simply to cultivate\r\na business or political 'friendship' with the legislator,\" then\r\npayments for entertainment would not constitute a violation of the\r\nTravel Act or the mail or wire fraud statutes.  85 F.3d at 741\r\n(emphasis added).  To so hold   that conduct is not illegal if it\r\nis \"simply\" to cultivate a friendship   does not immunize dual\r\nintent conduct.  The word \"simply\" carries the import of \"solely.\" \r\nA dual intent that seeks both to cultivate friendship and to\r\nillegally influence official acts is not a purpose that is \"simply\"\r\nto promote friendship.  Such a dual purpose is not insulated from\r\ncriminal liability merely because, in Sawyer, we were careful to\r\nprotect a purpose that is \"simply\" to promote friendship.\r\nSimilarly, in Sawyer we said:  \"[I]f Sawyer had this\r\nlimited intent   to cultivate friendship rather than to influence\r\nan official act   the federal statutes here involved would not be\r\nviolated.\"  Id. (emphasis added).  An intent \"limited\" to promoting\r\nfriendship does not include an intent that also has a second\r\npurpose.  The words \"rather than\"   when juxtaposed in this way\r\nagainst the \"limited intent\" language   imply that an intent to\r\ninfluence cannot be part of one's intent if one seeks the Sawyerimmunity.\r\nAfter discussing an intent limited to the cultivation of\r\nbusiness or friendship, Sawyer went on to say that:  \"Only if\r\ninstead or in addition, there is an intent to cause the recipient\r\nto alter her official acts may the jury find a theft of honest\r\nservices or the bribery predicate of the Travel Act.\"  Id. at 741\r\n(emphasis added).  Woodward's argument addresses the \"instead\"\r\nportion of the disjunctive, but Woodward offers no basis for\r\nreading the highlighted words out of our holding in Sawyer.  The\r\nquoted sentence clearly contemplates, not a \"bright line\" or\r\n\"either-or\" dichotomy (Def. Br. at 37-38), but the possibility that\r\na defendant may be prosecuted if he possesses a dual intent, an\r\nillegal intent \"in addition\" to a legal \"friendship\" intent.  \r\nThus, Sawyer's language does not mean what Woodward would\r\nlike it to mean   that conduct must have an exclusively illegalintent in order to be subject to the criminal laws.  Rather, it\r\nmeans only that conduct may not be subject to the criminal laws if\r\nthe intent underlying it is exclusively legal.  A defendant may be\r\nprosecuted for deprivation of honest services if he has a dual\r\nintent, i.e., if he is found to have intended both a lawful and an\r\nunlawful purpose to some degree.  If the jury finds that an\r\nunlawful purpose was present, it may convict the defendant.\r\nThe Third Circuit reached a similar conclusion in United\r\nStates v. Greber, 760 F.2d 68, 72 (3d Cir. 1985).  As Woodward\r\nnoted, the jury in Greber \"was instructed similarly to the present\r\ncase, making any amount of inducement, however small, illegal.\" \r\nDef. Br. at 39 n.27; see Greber, 760 F.2d at 72.  In United Statesv. Bay State Ambulance &amp; Hosp. Rental Serv., Inc., 874 F.2d 20 (1st\r\nCir. 1989), we noted that we were \"impressed with the Third\r\nCircuit's reasoning\" in Greber.  Bay State, 874 F.2d at 29-30. \r\nLikewise, the Second Circuit has \"noted that there could be dual\r\npurposes for payments, stating that a 'valid purpose that partially\r\nmotivates a transaction does not insulate participants in an\r\nunlawful transaction from criminal liability.'  The charge was\r\nentirely appropriate in light of [the defendant's] argument that he\r\nwas motivated by friendship.\"  United States v. Coyne, 4 F.3d 100,\r\n113 (2d Cir. 1993) (rejecting challenge to jury instruction that\r\ndefendant must be found to have accepted or solicited a thing of\r\nvalue \"at least in part\" for or because of his intent to be\r\ninfluenced) (citing Biaggi, 909 F.2d at 683); see also Anderson v.\r\nUnited States, 417 U.S. 211, 226 (1974) (conspiracy).\r\nTherefore, the answer to Woodward's assertion that \"[t]he\r\ndistrict court's instruction should . . . have parroted Sawyer,\"\r\nDef. Br. at 38, is that, for all relevant purposes, it did.  The\r\ndistrict court instructed the jury, inter alia, as follows:\r\nYou may not find that the defendant violated\r\neither set of federal laws which I have\r\ndescribed to you if his receipt of the\r\nexpenditures was solely part of a routine\r\ncultivation of a business or political\r\nfriendship rather than an intent on his part\r\nto be influenced in his official legislative\r\nduties.  If instead or in addition, there is\r\nan intent on the defendant's part to be\r\ninfluenced in his official legislative duties,\r\nthen you may find a violation of either set of\r\nfederal laws.  If there is both the intent to\r\ncultivate a business and political\r\nrelationship and the intent to be influenced\r\nin official legislative duties, then you may\r\nfind a violation of the federal laws.\r\n\nWoodward would have us go beyond Sawyer in the present\r\ncase.  He insists that the real issue here is the degree of\r\nunlawful intent necessary in a dual intent case to permit or\r\nsustain a conviction, and the necessary jury charge on that point. \r\nWoodward argues that the protective instruction we set forth in\r\nSawyer should be modified to say that an illegal purpose must be at\r\nleast \"one of the [scheme's] several dominant purposes,\" Def. Br.\r\nat 40 (quoting United States v. Ellis, 935 F.2d 385 (1st Cir. 1991)\r\n(Mann Act)) (emphasis added).  Otherwise, under our reading of\r\nSawyer, a de minimus illegal intent could result in a conviction\r\neven if it were dwarfed by a perfectly legal \"friendship\" intent.\r\nAccording to Woodward, the illegal purpose of the\r\ngratuity should not be a minor or incidental portion of the mix. \r\nWe disagree.  The criminal law may punish conduct even if its\r\nillegal purpose is incidental to other, legal purposes.  SeeAnderson, 417 U.S. at 226 (holding that the purpose to violate\r\nfederal law may be a secondary purpose, not necessarily primary);\r\nUnited States v. Ellis, 595 F.2d 154, 162 (3d Cir. 1979) (\"While\r\n[Supreme Court cases] require such a specific intent [to violate\r\nconstitutional rights], they do not require that the immediate\r\nintent to violate constitutional rights predominate over the\r\nultimate purposes which that violation is designed to achieve.\"). \r\nWe will assume nevertheless that Woodward is correct that\r\na conviction should not stand if the illegal intent is de minimusor insignificant.  But this does not mean that the district court\r\nerred in failing to give an instruction as to the \"de minimus\"\r\npoint.  The law may require a certain degree of illegal intent in\r\norder to convict, but it does not follow that an explicit\r\ninstruction on that point is necessary.  In the present case, even\r\nif the instructions were not technically adequate because they\r\nlacked an explicit \"de minimus\" instruction, Woodward was not\r\nprejudiced thereby.  \"An error in jury instructions will warrant\r\nreversal of a judgment only if the error is determined to have been\r\nprejudicial, based on a review of the record as a whole.\"  Davetv. Maccarone, 973 F.2d 22, 26 (1st Cir. 1992).  As we have already\r\ndiscussed in Part III, there is no evidentiary basis in this record\r\nfor Woodward's implicit contention that he had no more than a de\r\nminimus degree of intent to defraud the public of his honest\r\nservices.  Therefore the omission of explicit \"de minimus\" language\r\nfrom the jury instructions   even if erroneous   did not prejudice\r\nWoodward, and any error does not warrant reversal of his\r\nconviction.  See Davet, 973 F.2d at 26.\r\n                           IV\r\n                  Super Bowl Evidence\r\nWoodward appeals the denial of his motion in limine to\r\nexclude evidence that Hancock, through Sawyer, paid for a 1986 trip\r\nfor Woodward and his wife to the Super Bowl in New Orleans.  The\r\ncourt permitted the government to introduce evidence concerning the\r\nWoodwards' receipt of $1,809 worth of airfare, lodging, and tickets\r\nto the game.  After admitting such evidence, the court gave a\r\nlimiting instruction to the jury.  \r\nWoodward objects that this particular gratuity involved\r\nmore money and was different in kind than the gratuities on the\r\nbasis of which he was convicted:  it included payment for airfare\r\nand lodging, whereas all other gratuities were limited to meals,\r\ngolf, and other forms of entertainment.  He also points out that\r\nthe statute of limitations precludes Woodward from being charged\r\nwith crimes committed prior to July 27, 1990, and that 18 U.S.C.\r\n1346 was not even enacted until November 18, 1988.  For these\r\nreasons, Woodward claims that the admission of the Super Bowl\r\nevidence was of limited probative value, and that whatever\r\nprobative value it did have was substantially outweighed by the\r\ndanger of unfair prejudice.  He argues that it should have been\r\nexcluded under Fed. R. Evid. 403.  \r\nUnder Rule 403, \"if the evidence brings unwanted baggage,\r\nsay, unfair prejudice or a cognizable risk of confusing the jury,\r\nand if the baggage's weight substantially overbalances any\r\nprobative value, then the evidence must be excluded.\"  United\r\nStates v. Aguilar-Aranceta, 58 F.3d 796, 800 (1st Cir. 1995)\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted).  \"The damage done to the\r\ndefense is not a basis for exclusion; the question under Rule 403\r\nis one of unfair prejudice -- not of prejudice alone.\"  United\r\nStates v. Munoz, 36 F.3d 1229, 1233 (1st Cir. 1994) (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted).  We review trial court rulings under Rule\r\n403 for abuse of discretion.  See United States v. Fulmer, 108 F.3d\r\n1486, 1497 (1st Cir. 1997); Aguilar-Aranceta, 58 F.3d at 800.\r\nWe note first that, while Woodward is concerned that this\r\nparticularly expensive gratuity might prejudice the jury because of\r\nits amount, he neglects to mention the coincidence in the timing: \r\nthe Super Bowl took place shortly after Woodward became chair of\r\nthe Insurance Committee, which happened to be a position from\r\nwhich he could potentially be of great use to Sawyer and Hancock. \r\nThe government argues, with some force, that the Super Bowl\r\ngratuity, elaborate as it was, established and set the tone for the\r\nongoing relationship, i.e., a conspiracy to trade valuable gifts\r\nfor influence, to deprive Woodward's constituents of his honest\r\nservices.  Once the nature of the relationship was established,\r\nongoing gifts could be given in smaller amounts in order to \"keep\r\nthe wheels greased.\"  Thus, the Super Bowl evidence has a good deal\r\nmore probative value than Woodward suggests.  And its prejudicial\r\neffect is far less:  accepting tickets to the Super Bowl is not so\r\nheinous or outrageous that the jury was likely to be inflamed\r\nagainst Woodward and ignore the arguments presented in his\r\ndefense, thereby risking a conviction based on passion rather than\r\non the evidence.  Cf. United States v. Bartelho, 129 F.3d 663, 677-\r\n78 (1st Cir. 1997) (affirming admission of plans to escape from\r\nprison at trial on bank robbery); Pitrone, 115 F.3d at 7-8\r\n(admitting evidence of defendant's boasting about 40 prior\r\ncommissions of the same crime); United States v. Rivera, 83 F.3d\r\n542, 545-47 (1st Cir. 1996) (evidence that defendant raped victim\r\nadmissible at trial on carjacking charge); United States v.\r\nManning, 79 F.3d 212, 217-18 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct.\r\n147 (1996) (admitting evidence of prior drug dealing at trial on\r\ncurrent drug trafficking charges); United States v. Cruz-Kuilan, 75\r\nF.3d 59, 61 (1st Cir. 1996) (affirming admission of evidence that\r\nvictim died of gunshot wounds at trial for carjacking); United\r\nStates v. Lombard, 72 F.3d 170, 190 (1st Cir. 1995) (evidence\r\nrelating to murder, of which defendant had previously been\r\nacquitted, admitted at trial on firearms violations).\r\nIn Sawyer, we noted the district court's decision to\r\nadmit the same Super Bowl evidence to prove \"Sawyer's state of mind\r\nwith respect to the alleged scheme to defraud.\"  85 F.3d at 721\r\nn.1.  We observed that the court had instructed the jury, as the\r\ndistrict court did here, that these events took place prior to the\r\ntime indictable under the statute of limitations, but that such\r\nevidence was probative of the defendant's (there, Sawyer's) state\r\nof mind.  In Sawyer, we did not address the propriety of admitting\r\nthis evidence because Sawyer had not challenged it as Woodward has\r\nhere.  In this case, we hold that the district court properly\r\nadmitted this evidence, to prove Woodward's intent and the nature\r\nof the conspiracy.\r\n                           V\r\n                       Conclusion\r\nIn this case, the jury instructions adequately conveyed\r\nto the jury the difference between conduct that is legal and\r\nconduct that violates the criminal laws.  The evidence was\r\nsufficient to enable a rational jury to conclude beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt that Woodward was guilty of the four counts on\r\nwhich he was convicted, and no ground for error has been found. \r\nThe judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n",

The charges stem from his acceptance of illegal gratuities from William Sawyer and others, with the intent of depriving Woodward's constituents of his honest services as a legislator.  In this appeal, Woodward claims that the evidence was insufficient to establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on any of the four counts.

United States v. Gonzalez-Maldonado, 115 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir.1997);  Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 731.   Francis H. Woodward was first elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1977.  He was assigned to the Joint Committee on Insurance (\"Insurance Committee\"), and served as the Committee's House Chair from January, 1985 through January 19, 1991.  Beginning January 20, 1991 and continuing through April 1992 when he resigned from the legislature, Woodward was assigned to the Transportation Committee, which had no jurisdiction over insurance matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the relevant time period, John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company (\"Hancock\") was one of the two largest life insurance companies in Massachusetts, and one of the ten largest in the entire United States.  Because Hancock is domiciled in Massachusetts and is regulated primarily at the state level, Massachusetts' laws and regulations have a major impact on Hancock, affecting such issues as the corporation's organization and funding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">William Sawyer was the senior legislative counsel in Hancock's Government Relations Department.  He was responsible for lobbying the Massachusetts legislature on behalf of bills favored by Hancock and the industry, and against those bills they opposed.  He actively lobbied the Insurance Committee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hancock was also a member of an industry trade association known as the Life Insurance Association of Massachusetts (\"LIAM\").  LIAM also employed lobbyists who worked on Massachusetts legislation, in coordination with the lobbyists of its member companies.  Sawyer was an active participant in LIAM as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bills filed in the Massachusetts legislature were assigned to committee by subject matter.  The Insurance Committee, comprising eleven representatives and six senators, was one of the principal legislative committees to which legislation of interest to Hancock and LIAM was assigned.  From 1985 through 1990, the Insurance Committee received, on average, three hundred bills a year, one hundred of which affected the life insurance industry.  Of those bills, the industry was interested in passing an average of only five per year;  it opposed the rest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The committee's procedures were, in general, as follows.  First, public hearings were held on the bills.  Following such hearings, the members of the committee voted on the bills in executive sessions that were open to the public.  If the bill received a favorable recommendation in the committee's executive session, it was reported out favorably for further action on the floor of either the House or the Senate.  If it received an unfavorable recommendation or a study order in the committee's executive session vote, then in all likelihood the bill would not pass in that session.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Insurance Committee was co-chaired by one House and one Senate member.  The co-chairs, Woodward and his Senate co-chair, directed the activities of the committee, supervising the committee staff and scheduling all public hearings, executive sessions, and meetings.  As co-chair, Woodward had the authority to assign bills to the hearing calendar and subsequent executive sessions, and to take other action that would help to advance bills through the committee (or he could choose not to take such action).  Woodward also had the authority to affect the disposition of a bill, including the ability to \"carry\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> a bill through the legislative process or to send it to \"study,\" which effectively shelved it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As one of the four most active lobbyists on behalf of domestic life insurance companies, Sawyer was frequently present at Insurance Committee meetings.  He saw Woodward two or three times a week, and was the lobbyist who met most often with Woodward.  After Woodward was removed from the Insurance Committee in January 1991, Sawyer continued to appear at committee meetings and to meet with Woodward's successor as House Chair with the same frequency as he had before.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the heart of the government's case was the evidence of Sawyer's expenditures on Woodward for shared meals and entertainment.  From 1984 through 1992, Woodward accepted in excess of $9,000 in gratuities from Hancock and LIAM through their lobbyists Sawyer and William F. Carroll, the president of LIAM.  Hancock provided the majority of this largesse, at least $8,740 in meals, rounds of golf, and other entertainment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government introduced evidence showing that, from March 28, 1984 through January 23, 1992, Sawyer expended $8,740 on behalf of Woodward.  Of that total, $1,827 was expended after the statute of limitations period began, i.e., after July 27, 1990.  One thousand three hundred forty dollars ($1,340) of the total expenditures occurred after January 19, 1991, when Woodward was removed from the Insurance Committee.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sawyer's expenditures consisted of (1) shared meals and entertainment at conferences, generally once or twice a year;  (2) miscellaneous meals and rounds of golf each year in Massachusetts;  (3) a dinner at the annual Fourth of July social gathering on Cape Cod;  and (4) a trip in January 1986 to the Super Bowl in New Orleans.  Expenditures from categories (1) and (2) are the subject of this appeal on the sufficiency issue.  The jury acquitted Woodward as to category (3) expenditures.  Evidence relating to the Super Bowl was not the subject of the indictment, but was admitted, over Woodward's objection, to show the nature of the conspiracy and for its bearing on intent;  Woodward appeals the admission of that evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The National Conference of Insurance Legislators (COIL) is a national association of state legislators involved in insurance matters.  Every year the organization sponsored one or more conferences for legislators, at various sites around the country, where educational presentations were made concerning insurance matters.  Woodward attended many COIL conferences, as did other legislators from Massachusetts and elsewhere.  Legislators' travel and hotel expenses were paid from a legislative account or campaign funds but not by the insurance industry.  Woodward and Sawyer frequently played golf at exclusive clubs near the conference site, and Sawyer generally paid the costs of the golf.  Sawyer used his corporate credit card to pay for business-related expenses.  He submitted an expense account statement with receipts, and Hancock reimbursed Sawyer for such expenses.  In addition, Sawyer paid for a number of dinners at local restaurants that would be attended by legislators such as Woodward who were attending the conferences.  At times, William Carroll of LIAM would pay for the dinners.  Sawyer/Hancock also paid for Woodward's entertainment while at these conferences, such as tickets for the Grand Ole Opry when the conference was in Nashville.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the COIL conference expenditures, Sawyer paid for Woodward's meals at expensive restaurants, as early as 1984, when Woodward was in the Legislature but before Woodward served as co-chair of the Insurance Committee.  This practice continued throughout the years Woodward remained in the House, with higher amounts generally in the years he was committee chair.  Sawyer also paid for an average of three to five golf outings with Woodward each year at various locations in Massachusetts.  These were principally at Sawyer's private golf club, the Woodland Golf Club.  Hancock also paid for other forms of entertainment, including boat rentals and tickets to tourist attractions such as Busch Gardens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government introduced into evidence a chart showing the amount of annual gratuities accepted by Woodward.  The pattern formed by these amounts is noteworthy.  In 1984 and 1985, before Woodward became chair of the Committee and for the first year afterward, Woodward accepted gratuities in the range of $200-300 from Sawyer/Hancock.  In 1986 there was a marked increase to $2,527, including over $1,800 to cover the air fare, hotel, and tickets (for him and his wife) to attend the Super Bowl in New Orleans.  In 1987-91, Woodward received gratuities in the amount of $1,547, $1,093, $513<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>, $1,230, and $1,324.  Woodward served as committee chair during all but the last of these years.  During his last four months in the legislature, January through April 1992, he received only $16, and his gratuities dropped to $0 after he resigned from office in April.  After Woodward was replaced as committee chair by Rep.  Francis Mara, Sawyer began wining and dining Mara in the same manner as he had Woodward.  Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 721.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to Sawyer's payments on behalf of Woodward, LIAM lobbyists also paid for some of Woodward's meals during the period of the charged conspiracy (1984-92).  These amounted to $444.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward's official actions, for the most part, conformed with the way Sawyer and Hancock wanted the recipient of their gratuities to conduct himself.  Sawyer was the lobbyist with whom Woodward met the most, according to Robert J. Smith, the research director for the Insurance Committee.  They met approximately three times a week when the legislature was in session.  And Woodward repeatedly acted on behalf of Hancock and the life insurance industry in his capacity as co-chair of the Committee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Smith, Woodward was the most pro-life-insurance-industry chair of the Insurance Committee during Smith's tenure, 1985-95 (which included six other House and Senate chairs).  Woodward actively supported the industry's position on most bills of importance to the industry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As his defense to the charge that he engaged in illegal theft of honest services, Woodward presented evidence that Sawyer's expenditures on his behalf were based not on bribery but on their \"close\" friendship.  In addition to their business relationship, Woodward and Sawyer maintained a personal relationship.  They met in the late 1970s, which is the time Woodward began serving on the Insurance Committee.  The two families socialized together even before Woodward assumed the chair of the Committee in 1984.  The two couples drove together to a conference in New York in 1980, and the Sawyers and their children visited the Woodwards at the latter's house on Cape Cod as early as 1982.  Beginning in about 1984, the Sawyers would traditionally stay at the Woodwards' house on the Cape for an annual Fourth of July weekend gathering.  The two families also shared other times, including family celebrations and tragedies.  Mrs. Woodward testified that the Sawyers were one of three couples with whom the Woodwards were the closest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury convicted Woodward of four<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> (of the twenty-eight) charges against him:  one count each of mail and wire fraud, one count of interstate travel to commit bribery, and one count of conspiracy to commit the foregoing three offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>Requisite Intent Under Mail and Wire Fraud Statutes</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To support a conviction for mail or wire fraud, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt:  \"(1) the defendant's knowing and willing participation in a scheme or artifice to defraud with the specific intent to defraud, and (2) the use of the mails or interstate wire communications in furtherance of the scheme.\"  Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 723;  see 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1341, 1343.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  \"[T]he term 'scheme or artifice to defraud' includes a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 1346;  see Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 723-24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government charged that Woodward engaged in a scheme to deprive the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and its citizens (collectively, \"the public\" or \"citizenry\") of their right to his honest services as a state legislator, performed free from deceit, fraud, dishonesty, conflict of interest, and self-enrichment.  In addition to this general duty of honest services, the government charged that Woodward had a specific duty to abide by Massachusetts reporting requirements.  With regard to the scheme to defraud, the government charged, inter alia, that Woodward accepted, from individuals (including Sawyer) representing Hancock and LIAM, golf, meals, tickets, and other entertainment and benefits, in violation of Massachusetts law;  that Woodward filed false Statements of Financial Interest (\"SFI\") under oath, in which he unlawfully failed to report to the State Ethics Commission his receipt of the gratuities;  that Sawyer on behalf of Hancock and LIAM was given greater access to the Insurance Committee and to Woodward as House Chair than was available generally to the citizenry;  and that, from 1984 through 1990, Woodward repeatedly performed official acts on behalf of Hancock and LIAM.  The government further charged that Woodward used the mails and interstate telephone wires in furtherance of the scheme, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1341 and 1343.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Sawyer, we discussed mail and wire fraud in connection with theft of honest services in a closely analogous situation where the same facts formed the backdrop for the case.  We particularly highlighted the intent required to support a conviction;  intent is also a major issue in the present case.  But as Woodward stresses, his situation--as the legislator--is not exactly identical to that of Sawyer as the lobbyist.  We will, therefore, summarize our analysis in Sawyer, insofar as is applicable here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We explained that, prior to Sawyer, honest services fraud had typically been found in two types of circumstances:  (1) bribery, where a legislator was paid for a particular decision or action, or (2) failure to disclose a conflict of interest, resulting in personal gain.  85 F.3d at 724.   As to the latter, we noted that \"[a] public official has an affirmative duty to disclose material information to the public employer.  When an official fails to disclose a personal interest in a matter over which she has decision-making power, the public is deprived of its right either to disinterested decision making itself or, as the case may be, to full disclosure as to the official's potential motivation.\"  Id. (citing United States v. Silvano, 812 F.2d 754, 759 (1st Cir.1987)).  \"Thus, undisclosed, biased decision making for personal gain, whether or not tangible loss to the public is shown, constitutes a deprivation of honest services.\"  Id. The Sawyer case expanded category (1) from quid pro quo bribery, to include a more generalized pattern of gratuities to coax \"ongoing favorable official action.\"  Id. at 730;  see infra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The broad scope of the mail fraud statute, however, does not encompass every instance of official misconduct,\" even of \"reprehensible misconduct,\" \"that results in the official's personal gain.\"  Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 725.   The government must prove that the defendant intended to deprive the public of its right to the honest services of its legislators.  Id. at 725, 730.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>This intent could be shown in a number of ways.  For example, a bribery-like, corrupt intent to influence official action necessarily is an intent to deprive the public of an official's honest services.  A person might not, however, give an unlawful gratuity with the intent to effect a specific quid pro quo.  Rather, as the government contends here, a person with continuing and long-term interests before an official might engage in a pattern of repeated, intentional gratuity offenses in order to coax ongoing favorable official action in derogation of the public's right to impartial official services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 730 (noting that \"[s]uch conduct would be akin to (although not a classic case of) the conflict of interest cases noted\" previously).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying this principle to the facts adduced, we stated that, \"while Sawyer may not have provided the legislators with direct kickbacks or commissions arising out of the specific official action, he may have intended the legislators generally to treat preferentially Hancock's interests, knowing that the free meals, entertainment, and golf would continue so long as favorable official acts were, at some point, taken.\"  Id.  We reversed the mail and wire fraud convictions, nevertheless, because we could not be sure that the jury convicted Sawyer based upon the Massachusetts gift statute (as a basis for the federal scheme to defraud) or the Massachusetts gratuity statute, and the former had been improperly charged in the court's instructions to the jury.  We mandated a protective instruction to be used in cases such as this, which would help the jury understand the difference between \"reprehensible misconduct\" which is not a violation of federal law, and misconduct which does form the basis for a federal conviction.  Id. at 741.   Noting that prior cases usually involved \"quid pro quo bribery or blatant conflict of interest,\" which was clearly illegal, we distinguished Sawyer's gratuities to Woodward (and other legislators) as involving conduct which \"itself may not be very different, except in degree, from routine cultivation of friendship in a lobbying context,\" which does not violate federal criminal law.  Id. We noted that \"[t]he practice of using hospitality, including lavish hospitality, to cultivate business or political relationships is longstanding and pervasive.\"  Id. Because the \"difference between lawful and unlawful turns primarily on intent,\" we held that the court must instruct the jury that a lobbyist does not commit honest services fraud or violate the Travel Act if his \"intent was limited to the cultivation of business or political friendship.\"  Id. He commits those violations \"only if instead or in addition, there is an intent to cause the recipient to alter her official acts.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward's principal argument on appeal is that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that he had the requisite intent on any of the four counts at issue here.  We will focus our discussion here on the mail and wire fraud counts.  We held in Sawyer that the intent required for a Travel Act violation is the same as that for mail and wire fraud.  85 F.3d at 741.   Woodward argues that the conspiracy count must fall because there is insufficient evidence to support the substantive counts that served as its objects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because theft of honest services constitutes a \"scheme or artifice to defraud\" within the meaning of the mail and wire fraud statutes, see Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 723-24, the question becomes whether the jury could reasonably have found that Woodward intended to steal his honest services from the public.  As Woodward phrased it in his brief, \"[t]he central question is whether by accepting his friend's largesse Woodward intended to be influenced to support Hancock's legislative interests.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>* Standard of Review</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining the evidentiary sufficiency of a guilty verdict, \"the relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"  Jackson v.

He argues that the evidence was insufficient to show that Woodward accepted Sawyer's gratuities with the intent to deprive the public of his honest services by performing official acts on behalf of Hancock (or the life insurance industry).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward \"bear[s] a heavy burden\" in arguing insufficiency of the evidence, even with respect to this intent element.

Andujar, 49 F.3d 16, 20 (1st Cir.1995)).  In such cases, \"a reasonable jury must necessarily entertain a reasonable doubt.\"  Andujar, 49 F.3d at 20.

Nor are juries \"required to examine the evidence in isolation\";  \" 'individual pieces of evidence, insufficient in themselves to prove a point, may in cumulation prove it.  The sum of an evidentiary presentation may well be greater than its constituent parts.' \"  United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 711 (1st Cir.1992) (quoting Bourjaily v. United States, 483 U.S. 171, 179-80, 107 S.Ct. 2775, 97 L.Ed.2d 144 (1987));  see also United States v. Montminy, 936 F.2d 626, 627-28 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Sawyer, we reviewed much of the same evidence that was presented to the jury here, and determined that the evidence was sufficient \"to prove [Sawyer's] intent to influence the legislators' official acts.\"  85 F.3d at 731.   We noted that Sawyer continually gave gifts for the purposes of gaining access and developing a relationship with Woodward and other legislators.  From this, the jury could have inferred that Sawyer intended to induce official actions favorable to Hancock's interests.  Id.;  see also id. at 739 (noting that Sawyer gave items of substantial value to legislators like Woodward who had the ability to take official action favorable to Hancock, that those gifts ceased after the legislators left office, and that Sawyer had long-term ongoing interests in official actions and knew the gratuities were illegal;  and concluding that the jury could rationally have inferred that \"the gratuities were motivated by the legislators' performance of official duties, i.e., that they were given 'for or because of any official act,' within the meaning of the Massachusetts gratuity statute, Mass.  Gen. L. ch.  268A, &#167; 3.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same inferences regarding Woodward's intent can be drawn from the evidence here, based upon the nature and sequences of events, certain explicit statements, and the suggestions of a cover-up.  In Sawyer, of course, the jury was assessing the motivation of the donor of the gratuity, Sawyer, not that of the donee, Woodward.  But it is an equally valid inference, from the foregoing evidence coupled with the fact that Sawyer and Woodward spent a good amount of time together, that Woodward understood the gratuities and their purpose in the same way that his \"close friend\" Sawyer did.  Woodward knew that Sawyer was giving him items of substantial value, continuing over a long period of time;  he knew that Sawyer had a long-term ongoing interest in his official acts;  and that he had the ability to take official action favorable to Hancock.  Woodward also knew that his relationship with Sawyer began after he became a member of the Insurance Committee and that the gifts increased substantially shortly after he became chair of the committee that handled insurance legislation.  Finally, Woodward knew that, at many of the same entertainment events that he enjoyed, Sawyer also wined and dined other legislators in a similar manner, and those legislators had only a business relationship, not a friendship, with Sawyer.  In light of all this, the jury could have inferred that Woodward knew what the deal was--that the gratuities would continue as long as he voted favorably to Hancock's interests, see Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 730--and that he intended to be influenced by the gratuities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the jury had additional evidentiary bases for drawing the inference that Woodward's intent included an illegal element rather than being solely based on friendship.  After entertaining Woodward for several days at the Scottsdale COIL conference in 1991, Sawyer left the conference early, but left his credit card to be used for paying Woodward's golf and meal expenses during the remainder of the conference.  This is not consistent with mere friendship as the sole purpose of the payments, but rather is more consistent with the theory of a gratuity made because of Woodward's potential official actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, Woodward received some gratuities from Sawyer (although in lesser amounts) at events where other legislators--mostly members of the Insurance Committee, who could also influence legislative acts in favor of Hancock--were also present.  This too indicates an illegal gratuity more than the camaraderie of \"close friends.\"   Similarly, some of Woodward's gratuities came from LIAM, through its president, Carroll, who was not a personal friend of Woodward's.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same inference can be drawn from the fact that the expenditures were not mutual but rather operated in one direction only.  The standard operating procedure was for Sawyer to pay for meals, drinks and golf for Woodward;  Woodward did not make similar payments for Sawyer.  If the reason Sawyer \"picked up the tab\" for Woodward on some occasions was simply because the two men were \"close friends,\" one would expect there to be a roughly equal number of occasions on which Woodward \"picked up the tab\" for Sawyer.  But that was not the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, the only evidence in the record as to Woodward performing some reciprocal acts of treating his \"close friend\" Sawyer were the weekends spent on Cape Cod.  On those occasions, Woodward invited the Sawyers to stay at the Woodward family's house on the Cape, where the Woodwards cooked some meals.  In return, according to Woodward, Sawyer would pay for a group dinner at a nearby restaurant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Significantly, the jury returned not guilty verdicts on all indictments alleging such reciprocal expenditures.  In contrast, the jury weighed the evidence differently as to four counts charging Woodward with accepting gratuities in a non-mutual, non-reciprocal way.  As to these, the jury apparently viewed Sawyer's expenditures and Woodward's acceptance of them as not being based on the two men's friendship but rather based on a business relationship:  i.e., insurance industry lobbyist and Chair of the Legislature's Insurance Committee.  The jury recognized--and this recognition is supported by the evidence of record--that the two men had two types of relationships, a personal friendship and a business relationship.  Woodward's acceptance of expenditures that were part of their friendship was not illegal, but his acceptance of expenditures in the context of their business relationship constituted theft of the honest services that Woodward owed to his constituents.  We think the evidence was sufficient for a reasonable juror to so conclude beyond a reasonable doubt.  The jury was free to \"choose among the reasonable alternatives posed by the evidence,\" Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 733, and we will not second-guess the jury's conclusion in this regard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another reason the jury could have rejected Woodward's contention that Sawyer picked up his tab solely because of friendship rather than as an attempt to influence is the direct statements showing how Woodward expected to receive gratuities from Sawyer (and, through him, from Hancock).  In 1989, at a COIL conference in Florida, Lorraine Bohannon, the former staff director of the Insurance Committee, who reported directly to Woodward, went out to dinner with Woodward, Sawyer, and their spouses.  There is no evidence that Bohannon had any kind of personal friendship with Sawyer.  After dinner, Bohannon offered to Woodward to pay a portion of the bill, and Woodward's response was:  \"Don't worry about it;  it's taken care of.\"   Sawyer picked up the tab and was reimbursed by Hancock for the bill.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government presented evidence of another direct statement to demonstrate Woodward's illegal intent.  After Woodward left the legislature, he expressed interest in working for Hancock as a lobbyist.  He asked Sawyer to help him obtain the job.  Sawyer told Woodward he was not qualified for the job, and Woodward was \"very hurt.\"   Subsequently when he talked to Committee research director Robert Smith about the Hancock job, Woodward said, in effect, \"After all I did for Bill Sawyer, you know, I can't believe he's not--he can't get me a job\" or \"he's not getting me a job.\"   The prosecutor asked Smith whether Woodward told him what \"he felt he had done for Bill Sawyer,\" and Smith replied, \"Not specifically, just generally.  'After all these years as Chairman of the committee and trying to do the right thing and being willing to take on tough issues, I would--I expected, you know, more assistance than I received.' \"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward argues that this conversation does not demonstrate any illegal intent on Woodward's part.  He points out that, at trial, Smith could not recall Woodward saying \"after all I've done for Sawyer,\" but only \"after all I've done.\"   Woodward also notes that \"trying to do the right thing\" could have meant following his own conscience, not necessarily doing the \"right thing\" for Sawyer and Hancock.  Similarly, \"taking on tough issues\" did not necessarily mean \"taking on tough issues\" for Sawyer or Hancock.  At trial, Smith testified that he did not interpret these phrases in an illegal manner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But Woodward's argument is belied by the totality of Smith's testimony about the conversation, or at least a reasonable jury could have so inferred.  In his grand jury testimony, which was used by the government at trial, Smith testified to the more directly inculpatory language:  \"after all I did for Bill Sawyer.\"   And Smith's trial testimony covered additional incriminating evidence that Smith had revealed to the grand jury but did not include in his direct testimony at trial.  When asked (at the grand jury session) to repeat the whole conversation, Smith testified:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p>[Woodward] said that he had spoken to Bill Sawyer and that Bill Sawyer had been reluctant to help him, and Representative Woodward at that time--as many legislators do, they don't remember the specific bill numbers or subject matter, but they'll remember in general if they were favorable towards someone or not--said to me \"you would think after all the years and everything I've done I would be treated better than I have been treated.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This juxtaposition of the \"everything I've done\" language with the notion of legislators \"remember[ing] in general if they were favorable towards someone or not\" carries a strong implication that, at least in Smith's mind as he heard Woodward make the quoted statements, Woodward's reference to \"all he had done\" was meant in the sense of taking action in the legislature to favor Sawyer and Hancock's interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith's grand jury testimony, elicited after an inconsistent statement at the trial, constitutes substantive evidence under Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(1)(A).  The jury, in assessing Smith's credibility in the context of all his testimony, could well have believed that Smith's grand jury testimony--with its incriminating inferences--was true;  and the jury could have concluded that Smith's trial testimony was not believable to the extent it undercut the grand jury testimony.  On appeal, of course, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, not the light most favorable to Woodward.  Credibility assessments are properly left to the jury.  United States v. Mangual-Corchado, 139 F.3d 34, 43 n. 20 (1st Cir.1998).  And juries are not required to evaluate the evidence in isolation;  \"individual pieces of evidence, insufficient in themselves to prove a point, may in cumulation prove it.\"  Bourjaily, 483 U.S. at 179-80, 107 S.Ct. 2775.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The inference of illegal intent grows even stronger when we consider another aspect of what Woodward told Smith about his attempt to persuade Sawyer to help him get a job at Hancock.  According to Smith's trial testimony, Woodward said:  \"If he [Woodward] could not get the job himself he'd like to see his son Brian get the job.\"   Smith testified that he was unaware of any experience that Woodward's son, Brian, had in insurance matters.  This, too, carries the implication that Woodward was expecting some kind of reward from Sawyer/Hancock for all his years of favoring the industry's position in the legislature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, as Woodward recognizes, \"[i]ntent can be inferred from a defendant's conduct, viewed in light of all the surrounding circumstances.\"   Def. Br. at 19;  see, e.g., Gaunt v. United States, 184 F.2d 284, 290-91 (1st Cir.1950).  Thus \"[t]he best evidence of Woodward's intent to perform official acts to favor Hancock's (and LIAM's) interests is the evidence of Woodward's actions on bills which were important to Hancock.\"  Id. Unfortunately for Woodward, the evidence supports the jury's verdict, rather than undermining it as he contends.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not necessary for the government to link a particular gratuity with a specific act in order to obtain a conviction.  Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 738-39;  see discussion supra at p. 55.   Nevertheless, Woodward disputes the extent to which, in his official capacity as chair of the Insurance Committee, he took action that served the interests of his benefactors.  The evidence does not support his contention.  According to Robert Smith, Woodward was the most pro-life-insurance-industry chair of the Committee, of the seven House and Senate chairs with whom Smith worked during the ten years that Smith served as the Committee's research director.  Woodward even took pro-industry positions in opposition to his own committee.  As an example, in each year from 1985 through 1990, the legislature considered a bill proposing mandatory discounts on life insurance for non-smokers.  Hancock and LIAM opposed the bill.  In 1989, the bill received favorable recommendation from the Insurance Committee based on support from Senator Linda Melconian, Woodward's co-chair of the Committee.  But despite the Committee's favorable report, Woodward led the opposition to the bill in debate before the full House of Representatives, and was successful in defeating the so-called \"non-smoker's bill\" for that session.  Hancock's vice-president, who directly supervised Sawyer, called the bill's defeat a \"significant victory for the industry.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward also led the Insurance Committee to support and report favorably bills proposed by the industry.  Among these were bills allowing life insurance companies to change the ways in which they valued real estate assets, to adjust pension funds, to provide financial services, and to be flexible in corporate governance and finance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, more than any other co-chair from 1985-95, Woodward \"carried\" bills sought by the life insurance industry.  This means that, after the bill left the committee, Woodward served as the point person to push these bills through the legislative process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward challenges this characterization of the meaning of \"carrying\" a bill after it leaves committee.  Woodward contends that \"carrying\" is merely a ministerial function, that it simply refers to the fact that the chair of any committee of the Massachusetts legislature \"sign[s] the paperwork recommending a bill favorably and [is] available to answer questions from non-committee legislators when [the bill is] presented to the House or Senate floor.\"   Woodward relies on Robert Smith's testimony for the proposition that carrying legislation does not necessarily mean advocating or leading the debate for the bill on the House floor, that that role is normally reserved for the legislator who sponsors the bill.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith's testimony to this effect, however, was impeached with his grand jury testimony in which he had testified that \"carrying\" meant actively guiding bills through the legislative process.  As we noted in discussing the conversations about getting Woodward a job at Hancock, the jury was entitled to believe this portion of Smith's testimony (i.e., introduction at trial of his prior grand jury testimony)--that \"carrying\" means actively guiding a bill through the process;  it is not merely ministerial--and the jury was entitled to disbelieve other parts of his trial testimony that supported Woodward's interpretation to the contrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward points to thirty-one (31) bills that he supported despite opposition on the part of Hancock and the insurance industry.  But, as the government notes, the proper analysis is to examine all bills considered by the Committee in context, not to isolate a relatively small number of bills in an effort to show that Woodward was not 100% in the industry's pocket.  The record reflects that, during his six years as co-chair of the Insurance Committee, there were approximately one hundred bills per year that were of interest to the life insurance industry, for a total of six hundred bills during his tenure.  Woodward opposed the industry's position on only thirty-one of those bills.  Moreover, at least ten of the opposed bills were duplicates of previously filed bills.  Of the remainder, only three actually related to life insurance.  The rest concerned mandated benefits for health insurance which were of less importance to the life insurance industry, in particular to Hancock.  This is because, as Hancock's attorney testified, life insurance was Hancock's \"big money earner in terms of profit.\"   The company's group health insurance business was \"[o]ne of the lesser profit earners.\"   As already noted, several of the bills where Woodward's position conformed to the life insurance industry's positions were of great importance to the industry in that the bills significantly improved the industry's profitability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward relies heavily on Czubinski, 106 F.3d at 1076, where we cited Sawyer for the \"most important[ ]\" proposition that the government must do more than \"merely indicate wrongdoing by a public official, but must also demonstrate that the wrongdoing at issue [was] intended to prevent or call into question the proper or impartial performance of that public servant's official duties.\"  Czubinski, 106 F.3d at 1076 (citing Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 725).   In Czubinski, we explained that Czubinski's \"case falls outside of the core of honest services fraud precedents,\" in that he was \"not bribed or otherwise influenced in any public decisionmaking capacity.\"  Id. at 1077.   We also distinguished Czubinski's \"relatively straightforward\" job--responding to information requests from the public--from \"a discretionary, decision-making role,\" which \"raise[s] the specter of secretive, self-interested action.\".  Id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> We found \"no evidence that Congress intended to create what amounts to a draconian personnel regulation,\" by \"transforming governmental workplace violations into [federal] felonies.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The instant case is very different from Czubinski.   As Woodward recognizes, Czubinski did not receive or intend to receive any tangible benefit from his conduct, whereas Woodward did.  Additionally, Czubinski's official duties did not involve the discretionary, decision-making role of a legislator.  \"Notwithstanding these factual differences,\" Woodward asserts, \"Czubinski and the instant case are similarly flawed by the failure of proof on the critical fraudulent intent element.\"   We disagree.  As discussed supra, the jury in the present case could justifiably have inferred the fraudulent intent element. Woodward did receive tangible benefits here, as Czubinski had not.  And the connection between the gratuities and Woodward's official acts could have been justifiably inferred from the fact that Woodward had discretion to act or not act in ways that would further the insurance industry's interests;  this discretion extended both to the bottom line (support of or opposition to the industry's position on legislation) and to the degree of vigor with which Woodward championed the industry's positions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p>2. Failure to Disclose Conflicts of Interest</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to demonstrating Woodward's intent by evidence showing that he was influenced or otherwise improperly affected in performing his duties, the government argues that Woodward's intent is also demonstrated by his failure to disclose his conflict of interest although he was required to do so.  We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts law mandates such disclosure on his Statements of Financial Interest (SFIs).  Mass. Gen. Laws ch.  268B, &#167; 5 (West 1990).  In addition, separate and apart from the state statute, \"[t]he obligation to disclose material information inheres in the legislator's general fiduciary duty to the public.\"  Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 733 n. 17.  We recognized in Sawyer that the nondisclosure of a conflict of interest is a second way in which a public official can steal his honest services.  85 F.3d at 724;  cf. id. at 728 (\"[U]nlike the honest services fraud cases, noted above, in which an official was bribed or took official action based on a secret conflict of interest, a gift statute violation, even if intentional, does not itself amount to honest services fraud.\"  (Emphasis added)).  The evidence of Woodward's non-disclosure is also probative of Woodward's intent;  it supports the jury's finding that he had the requisite intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">As we stated in Sawyer:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p>A public official has an affirmative duty to disclose material information to the public employer.  When an official fails to disclose a personal interest in a matter over which she has decision-making power, the public is deprived of its right either to disinterested decision making itself or, as the case may be, to full disclosure as to the official's potential motivation behind an official act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 724 (citing Silvano, 812 F.2d at 759).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the general \"affirmative duty to disclose\" discussed in Sawyer, Woodward had a specific statutory duty each year to file a Statement of Financial Interests with the Massachusetts State Ethics Commission.  See Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  268B, &#167; 5.  Woodward was required to disclose on his SFI forms all gifts he or his immediate family received, aggregating more than $100 per year, from lobbyists or businesses that had a direct interest in legislation.  He had to sign the forms under oath.  Woodward did not report the gratuities he received from Hancock or LIAM on any of his SFI forms submitted for the years 1984 through 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward contends that his failure to comply with the Massachusetts reporting statute, while \"reprehensible,\" is not relevant here.  We disagree.  In Czubinski, we listed \"the failure of public decision-makers to disclose certain conflicts of interest\" as one of three examples of \"serious corruption\" on the part of public officials that would \"typically\" justify an honest services conviction.  106 F.3d at 1076.   Woodward's failure to report supports the implication that Woodward was aware that these gratuities were improper, especially in light of the fact that \"[m]uch of his entertainment ... took place out-of-state--usually at industry and legislative conferences--where members of the Massachusetts citizenry generally would not observe the questionable activities.\"  Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 733.   Woodward had every incentive to keep these \"questionable activities\" secret from the public by not disclosing them on his SFIs.  The SFIs are public documents, which are frequently scrutinized by the press and political opponents during election years.  In fact, the only gift Woodward ever reported was a local, public golf tournament sponsored by Massachusetts Candy &amp; Tobacco Distributors, Inc., which he reported after learning that the tournament was under investigation by the State Ethics Commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the government that Woodward's intentional failure to disclose the Hancock and LIAM gifts in itself provides a solid basis for the jury to find that Woodward had the requisite intent to deprive the public of his honest services.  This same evidence also supports the finding that Woodward had the intent to deceive necessary for a mail and wire fraud conviction.  See supra at 55, n. 6. \"[A]n official's intentional violation of the duty to disclose provides the requisite 'deceit.' \"  Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 732 (quoting Silvano, 812 F.2d at 760).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewing the record in the light most favorable to the verdict, a rational jury could have found the requisite intent from the trial evidence.  The evidence was sufficient for a rational juror to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Woodward accepted gratuities from Sawyer with the intent to defraud the public of its right to his honest services, and that he had the specific intent to deceive.  See also Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 742 (finding that the evidence adduced there \"would be adequate to infer improper intent\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C</p>\n    <p>Other Elements of Wire Fraud (Count 9)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted supra, to support a conviction for mail or wire fraud, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt:  \"(1) the defendant's knowing and willing participation in a scheme or artifice to defraud with the specific intent to defraud, and (2) the use of the mails or interstate wire communications in furtherance of the scheme.\"  Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 723;  see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341, 1343.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward also challenges his convictions based on the second requirement.  He argues that the government offered insufficient evidence to prove either that Woodward caused the wiring or that the wiring was \"for the purpose of executing [the] scheme\" to defraud.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1343.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The wire fraud count relates to a COIL conference in Orlando, Florida, in November, 1990.  The indictment alleged that on November 21, 1990, a call was placed from Boston, Massachusetts, to Lake Buena Vista, Florida, and that its purpose involved \"[a]rrangements related to entertainment in Florida.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward claims that he did not \"cause\" this telephone call to be made, and that it was not made for the purpose of executing a scheme for Woodward to defraud the public of its right to his honest services.  We disagree on both points.  As we stated in Sawyer, Woodward \" 'need not personally use the wires as long as such use was a reasonably foreseeable part of the scheme in which [he] participated.' \"  85 F.3d at 723 n. 6 (quoting United States v. Boots, 80 F.3d 580, 585 n. 8 (1st Cir.1996), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 263, 136 L.Ed.2d 188 (1996)).  In addition, \"[t]he use of the mails or wires to further the fraudulent scheme need only be 'incidental.' \"  Id. (quoting United States v. Grandmaison, 77 F.3d 555, 566 (1st Cir.1996)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Woodward concedes that the jury could reasonably have inferred from the evidence that Hancock's Functions Coordinator called the Florida hotel on or about November 21, 1990, for the purpose of reserving a room, so Sawyer could attend the COIL conference in Orlando.  Nevertheless, Woodward claims that he could not have reasonably foreseen that a Hancock employee would make a room reservation for Sawyer at this COIL conference, nor that she would use the telephone to do so.  According to Woodward, Sawyer's \"presence [at the conference] could have been ensured by many means other than the fortuity of an interstate telephone call to reserve his hotel room.\"   We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward knew full well that Sawyer would need a hotel room in Florida for the COIL conference, and that Sawyer's office was located in Massachusetts.  Woodward could reasonably have foreseen that the hotel reservations in Florida would be made by phone either by Sawyer or by someone acting on his behalf.  That Sawyer could conceivably have made his room reservation in person or by mail does not undermine the foreseeability of a telephone call.  The jury was entitled to use its common sense to infer that a reasonable person would have foreseen a telephonic reservation, as a means commonly employed in the business world for transactions of this type.  Thus, the jury was entitled to conclude, based on the evidence presented, that Woodward \"caused\" the wiring.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward further argues that \"the evidence presented was insufficient to show that the purpose of this call was to execute a scheme by Woodward to deprive the public of its right to his honest services by receiving gratuities from Sawyer with the intent to favor unlawfully Hancock's legislative interests.\"   Def. Br. at 27.  We disagree.  The jury could reasonably have concluded that the call was made in furtherance of the scheme to defraud.  Sawyer would not have been able to give Woodward the illegal gratuities during the COIL conference if Sawyer did not have a hotel room in which to stay for the four days of the conference.  The call in question secured that room, and thus played an essential role in the scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion is buttressed by decisions involving mail fraud, which is analogous to wire fraud for these purposes.  The focus of our inquiry on this question \"ought to be concerned less with the precise contents of the particular mailings than with the role those mailings played in the execution of the scheme to defraud.\"  United States v. Serino, 835 F.2d 924, 928 (1st Cir.1987).  In Silvano, we upheld a mail fraud conviction of government officials, where the defendants neither placed nor received any of the mailings.  (The mailings consisted of the payment of premiums and commissions, all incidental to, but related to, commission of the fraud.)   We held that these mailings were sufficiently in furtherance of the fraud.  812 F.2d at 760.   We reasoned that \"the federal mail fraud statute sweeps broadly and its prohibitions extend to the use of the mails by corrupt local government officials.  It is similarly settled that use of the mails need be no more central to the illegal scheme than were the mailings supporting the counts upon which [the defendants] were convicted.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence was sufficient to support Woodward's wire fraud conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D</p>\n    <p>Mail Fraud (Count 4)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the mail fraud count, Woodward concedes that, \"because the evidence showed he was at events for which Sawyer paid with his credit card, it was reasonably foreseeable to him that Sawyer would be billed by mail for these credit card expenditures on his behalf.\"   Def. Br. at 28.  Therefore he does not contest the fact that he \"may be said to have 'caused' the mailing alleged in Count 4 when he let Sawyer pick up the tab.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But he contends that \"the purpose of the mailing strays far from the execution of a scheme by Woodward to defraud the public.\"  Id. at 29.   He argues that the scheme had already reached fruition by the time the mails were used.  He points to United States v. Maze, 414 U.S. 395, 94 S.Ct. 645, 38 L.Ed.2d 603 (1974), where the Supreme Court noted that \"Congress could have drafted the mail fraud statute so as to require only that the mails be in fact used as a result of the fraudulent scheme.  But it did not do this;  instead, it required that the use of the mail be 'for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice.' \"  Id. at 405, 94 S.Ct. 645 (footnote omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present case, the mailing in question was sent by Citibank Visa to Sawyer, billing him for charges arising from Sawyer's use of his Visa card to pay for illegal gratuities given to Woodward.  According to Woodward, because the mailing took place some three to four weeks after Sawyer purchased the meals and entertainment for Woodward, the use of the mail was \"a result of\" the fraudulent scheme but not \"for the purpose of executing\" the scheme.  Id. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward's argument focuses too narrowly, on each gratuity individually.  His contention assumes a new fraudulent scheme began and ended every time Sawyer used his credit card to pick up the tab for Woodward.  On the contrary, the evidence supported the conclusion that the fraudulent scheme in which Woodward and Sawyer participated was an ongoing scheme, lasting for years and involving Sawyer's use of his credit card.  Every month, Visa would use the mails to bill Sawyer for his charges;  if Sawyer did not pay those bills, his credit line would have been terminated and the gratuities could not have continued as Woodward and Sawyer expected.  It was thus a necessary part of the ongoing scheme that Sawyer pay his bill after receiving it in the mail.  See Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 730 (\"[A] person with continuing and long-term interests before an official might engage in a pattern of repeated, intentional gratuity offenses in order to coax ongoing favorable official action in derogation of the public's right to impartial official services.\")   This case is therefore distinguishable from Maze, where the mailing involved only a post-fraud accounting among victims, after the defendant's fraudulent use of credit cards was already completed.  See Maze, 414 U.S. at 402, 94 S.Ct. 645;  Schmuck v. United States, 489 U.S. 705, 714, 109 S.Ct. 1443, 103 L.Ed.2d 734 (1989) (distinguishing and limiting Maze to cases in which the fraudulent scheme has come to fruition).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward cursorily argues that the wiring and mailing are merely \"a pretext to manufacture federal jurisdiction over a local offense.\"   Def. Br. at 30 (mail fraud);  see id. at 28 (wire fraud).  We have already rejected such a federalism claim:  \"Congress may protect the integrity of the interstate mails and wires by forbidding their use in furtherance of schemes to defraud a state and its citizens, whether or not it can forbid the scheme itself.\"  Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 722-23 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence was sufficient to support the mail fraud conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>E</p>\n    <p>Travel Act (Count 14)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The elements of a Travel Act violation include:  (1) interstate travel or the use of an interstate facility;  (2) with the intent to promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate an unlawful activity (here, violation of the Massachusetts gratuity statute, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  268A, &#167; 3 (West 1990));  and (3) followed by performance or attempted performance of acts in furtherance of the unlawful activity.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1952;  United States v. Arruda, 715 F.2d 671, 681 (1st Cir.1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward argues that the evidence supporting the Travel Act conviction was deficient in four respects.  First, he argues that the evidence was insufficient to establish the requisite criminal intent to violate 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1952.  We disagree, for the same reasons discussed in Part III(B), supra, in relation to his intent under the mail and wire fraud statutes.  See Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 741 (equating intent requirements of mail and wire fraud statutes with that required under Travel Act).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Woodward maintains that, in order to prove a violation of the Travel Act, the government had to prove that Woodward violated the bribery laws of Florida.  The Travel Act punishes traveling in interstate commerce for the purpose of carrying on any unlawful activity;  such activity encompasses the commission of bribery \"in violation of the laws of the state in which committed or of the United States.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 1952(b)(2).  The indictment incorporates the Massachusetts gratuity statute, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  268A, &#167; 3, as the underlying bribery offense.  Woodward contends that the bribery, if any, took place only in Florida, and therefore, without evidence of any Florida bribery statute, the Travel Act conviction must be reversed.  This argument is unavailing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Travel Act \"does not require the government to prove that the alleged 'unlawful activity' violates the laws of the state ultimately traveled to,\" or of the state where money actually changed hands.  United States v. Walsh, 700 F.2d 846, 854-55 (2d Cir.1983) (mayor of city in New Jersey agreed in New Jersey to accept bribe and traveled to New York to collect it);  see United States v. Jones, 642 F.2d 909, 913 (5th Cir.1981).  A conviction may be sustained where the evidence demonstrates \"unlawful activity\" in violation of the laws of the state where the effects of the fraudulent scheme are felt, in this case, the state whose citizens are defrauded of their legislator's honest services.  See Walsh, 700 F.2d at 854-55.   Here, Woodward is a legislator from Massachusetts, and the jury could have concluded that the gratuity, though paid in Florida, was paid for the purpose of influencing legislative activities in and affecting Massachusetts.  As we discuss below, that is sufficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward's third challenge to his Travel Act conviction involves timing.  He asserts that there was no evidence that Woodward performed any acts in furtherance of the unlawful activity after the interstate travel on November 24, 1990, as alleged in the indictment.  Woodward notes that, although the Travel Act requires such, the Massachusetts gratuity statute does not require any subsequent activity to be taken in Massachusetts after the Florida bribe.  As evidence of Woodward's post-gratuity activity, the government points to Woodward's action with respect to S. 641, which proposed premium reductions in life insurance for policyholders who were non-smokers.  The bill was originally reported favorably out of the Insurance Committee on May 7, 1990.  Then on July 24, 1990, just before becoming law, the House of Representatives recommitted the bill to the Insurance Committee.  The effect of a bill's recommittal is that both chairs would have to act in order for the bill to be released.  The bill languished in the Insurance Committee with no further action taken through January 1, 1991, after Woodward received the Florida gratuities and prior to his removal as co-chair.  Woodward's co-chair, Senator Melconian, had actively supported the 1989 bill by requesting a favorable recommendation from the Insurance Committee.  The jury could, therefore, reasonably have inferred that Woodward prevented any further action on S. 641, because in the previous year he led the floor debate, on behalf of Hancock and LIAM, against a similar non-smokers bill.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward's receipt of the gratuities in Florida and the subsequent recommittal of S. 641 through January 1991 provided sufficient evidence to allow the jury to find that Woodward performed an act in furtherance of the unlawful activity after the travel to Florida on November 24, 1990.  Arruda, 715 F.2d at 682.   Woodward's timing argument thus fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward's fourth argument against his Travel Act conviction is that \"the payment of the 'bribe' in Florida\" has such an \"attenuated relationship to Massachusetts\" that it would violate the \"effects doctrine.\"   Def. Br. at 32.  \"Under this doctrine, a sovereign only possesses jurisdiction to prosecute a crime where, inter alia, 'the effect within the territory is substantial.' \"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Id.  (quoting Commonwealth v. Beneficial Fin.  Co., 360 Mass. 188, 275 N.E.2d 33, 57 n. 8 (1971)).  Because acts that might otherwise be \"gratuities\" could be performed out-of-state without any corresponding \"effect\" in Massachusetts, Woodward maintains that Massachusetts would lack jurisdiction to prosecute purely out-of-state expenditures.  Def. Br. at 32 (citing Heath v. Jones, 941 F.2d 1126, 1139 (11th Cir.1991) (no due process violation when state prosecutes crime that started within its borders and concluded in another state);  Commonwealth v. Levin, 11 Mass.App.Ct. 482, 417 N.E.2d 440, 451 (1981) (state may prosecute acts performed outside of its jurisdiction where acts are intended to produce and actually produce detrimental effects within the state)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward asserts that the government failed to produce any evidence of detrimental effect actually resulting from the out-of-state expenditures;  the \"mere possibility of future action favorable to Hancock is not an 'effect,' let alone one that is 'substantial.'   Nor would alteration of official acts be the 'direct' or 'foreseeable' result of lobbyists entertaining legislators at out-of-state conferences.\"   Def. Br. at 33 (citing Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 741).

Gen. Laws ch.  268A, &#167; 3.  \"The concern behind the gratuity statute, like the bribery statute, is the potential undermining of official integrity.\"  Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 735 (emphasis added).  Indeed, when someone gives a stream of illegal gratuities to a public official, a sense of being beholden to the giver's interests is exactly the kind of influence that the giver is trying to develop.  See id. at 730.   The potential effect on Massachusetts when one of its own legislators accepts gratuities out-of-state paid by someone with an interest in Massachusetts legislation is a sufficient nexus to satisfy the effects test and give Massachusetts jurisdiction to prohibit such conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Besides this potential effect, of course, Woodward's receipt of gratuities in Florida was linked also to his official acts in Massachusetts.  Among these acts is his recommittal of a particular bill, Senate Bill 641 (S.641), shortly after he returned from Florida, as already discussed.  And they also included his prior acts to champion the insurance industry's positions in the Legislature.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Woodward violated the Massachusetts gratuity statute, a prerequisite for his Travel Act violation, because he received something of \"substantial value ... for or because of any official act ... performed or to be performed by him.\"   Mass. Gen. Laws ch.  268A, &#167; 3.  We have already discussed our view that the evidence was sufficient to establish the linkage beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward's Florida gratuity was closely enough related to Massachusetts that his \"effects doctrine\" argument must fail.

As the district court noted, to hold otherwise would \"be at odds with the idea of official bribery or corruption....  [It would] provide a series of safe havens for those who wish to be bribed or [to be] the recipients of gratuities.  [It would be] at odds with the statute itself [and] with the larger purposes of the Travel Act.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>F</p>\n    <p>Conspiracy (Count 1)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to convict Woodward of conspiracy, the government had to prove that a conspiracy existed, that Woodward knew of and voluntarily participated in it, and that an overt act took place in furtherance of it.  See United States v. Frankhauser, 80 F.3d 641, 653 (1st Cir.1996).  The agreement need not be explicit;  a tacit agreement will suffice.  See id.;  Direct Sales Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. 703, 712-13, 63 S.Ct. 1265, 87 L.Ed. 1674 (1943).  To establish Woodward's voluntary participation in the conspiracy, the evidence must establish both his intent to agree and his intent to effectuate the object of the conspiracy.  Frankhauser, 80 F.3d at 653;  see also United States v. Piper, 35 F.3d 611, 615 (1st Cir.1994).  Neither the agreement nor Woodward's participation in it need be proven with direct evidence.  See Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942);  Frankhauser, 80 F.3d at 653.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward's challenge to his conspiracy conviction is that it depends on the three substantive counts on which he was convicted, and he maintains that those counts suffered from sufficiency of the evidence infirmities that compel acquittal.  \"Because these infirmities extend to the conspiracy count,\" he argues, \"Count 1 must fall for the same reasons as the three substantive counts of which it is comprised.\"   Def. Br. at 34.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward's argument is unavailing, because we have concluded that none of the three substantive counts comprising the conspiracy count was infirm.  Therefore, the evidence is sufficient to support the conspiracy conviction for the same reasons discussed supra concerning the substantive counts, and Woodward's conspiracy conviction must stand.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the evidence in this record, we conclude that a reasonable jury could have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Woodward committed all elements of the four offenses of which he was convicted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <p>Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward contends that the district court erred in instructing the jury as to the intent necessary to support a conviction, contrary to our decision in Sawyer.   Such a challenge to the jury instructions presents legal issues which we review de novo.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  United States v. Phath, 144 F.3d 146, 148-49 (1st Cir.  May 20, 1998);  United States v. Pitrone, 115 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1997) (When the alleged error involves the instructions' adequacy in explaining the law, such as \"interpretation of the elements of a statutory offense, it poses a question of law and sparks plenary review.\");  United States v. Fulmer, 108 F.3d 1486, 1494 (1st Cir.1997).  We must look at the entire charge, in light of the evidence, and determine whether, taken as a whole, the court's instructions \"fairly and adequately submit[ted] the issues in the case to the jury,\" United States v. Cassiere, 4 F.3d 1006, 1022 (1st Cir.1993) (internal quotation marks omitted), or whether they \"tended to confuse or mislead the jury\" as to the applicable principles of law, Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 726 (internal quotation marks omitted);  see Fulmer, 108 F.3d at 1494.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court is not obligated to \"follow the exact form and wording of the defendant's proposed instructions.\"  United States v.

Rather, \"[t]he trial court has considerable latitude in charging the jury,\" so long as the charge as a whole fairly and adequately limns the law applicable to the controlling issues.  Cassiere, 4 F.3d at 1022 (internal quotation marks omitted).  That latitude is not unlimited, however.  Clear, accurate, easily understood jury instructions are \"vitally important in assuring that jurors grasp subtle or highly nuanced legal concepts.\"  United States v. DeStefano, 59 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1995).  In Sawyer, in order to protect a defendant from being convicted based on conduct that was not actually illegal, we reversed the conviction and mandated a protective instruction in cases such as this one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present case, Woodward challenges the district court's instruction on the issue that the court and the parties referred to as the issue of \"mixed motive.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  Proof of motive is not an element of the offenses.  The phrase \"mixed motive\" was apparently meant as shorthand for the dual intent that might be supportable by the evidence in this case:  the jury could have concluded (1) that Woodward accepted expenditures based on his legitimate friendship with Sawyer, or (2) that these were unlawful expenditures to influence official action (or some combination of the two).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward argues that our decision in Sawyer intended to draw a bright line between \"the merely unattractive and actual criminal conduct.\"  Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 741.   On one side of the line, according to Woodward, is conduct that is \"unattractive\" or even \"reprehensible\" but is not illegal as a matter of federal criminal law.  This would include lavish hospitality if intended to cultivate business or political relationships or friendships.  On the other side of the line is illegal expenditures, i.e., those by lobbyists intended \"to cause the recipient to alter her official acts.\"  Id. According to Woodward, Sawyer presented this analysis \"largely in stark 'either-or' terms.\"   Def. Br. at 35.  He claims to have premised \"the core\" of his defense on this \"bright line\" distinction, attempting to persuade the jury that Woodward and Sawyer's relationship should be found \"to fall on the 'friendship' side of the line,\" because of the family friendship and the social nature of the functions at which the expenditures were made.  Id. at 38.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward's theory of the case is flawed, based on a misreading of our decision in Sawyer.   Relationships among human beings, especially among lobbyists and elected officials, will frequently not follow a bright-line pattern, falling on one side or the other of some magical wall dividing friendship from attempts at undue influence.  A lobbyist and legislator may initially have an exclusively business relationship when they first meet, but if it continues over time, given the nature of the lobbying business with its sometimes \"lavish hospitality,\" Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 741, the individuals involved may eventually get to know each other, and some may be able to claim, with some truth, that their relationship has become one of friendship.  We did not imply anything different in Sawyer,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> and we certainly did not state or imply what Woodward's theory seems to entail:  that the formation of a friendship between a lobbyist and a legislator somehow insulates both from prosecution for honest services fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A look at Sawyer's language illustrates Woodward's error.  We stated:  \"[I]f the aim of the lobbyist were simply to cultivate a business or political 'friendship' with the legislator,\" then payments for entertainment would not constitute a violation of the Travel Act or the mail or wire fraud statutes.  85 F.3d at 741 (emphasis added).  To so hold--that conduct is not illegal if it is \"simply\" to cultivate a friendship--does not immunize dual intent conduct.  The word \"simply\" carries the import of \"solely.\"   A dual intent that seeks both to cultivate friendship and to illegally influence official acts is not a purpose that is \"simply\" to promote friendship.  Such a dual purpose is not insulated from criminal liability merely because, in Sawyer, we were careful to protect a purpose that is \"simply\" to promote friendship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, in Sawyer we said:  \"[I]f Sawyer had this limited intent--to cultivate friendship rather than to influence an official act--the federal statutes here involved would not be violated.\"  Id. (emphasis added).  An intent \"limited\" to promoting friendship does not include an intent that also has a second purpose.  The words \"rather than\"--when juxtaposed in this way against the \"limited intent\" language--imply that an intent to influence cannot be part of one's intent if one seeks the Sawyer immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After discussing an intent limited to the cultivation of business or friendship, Sawyer went on to say that:  \"Only if instead or in addition, there is an intent to cause the recipient to alter her official acts may the jury find a theft of honest services or the bribery predicate of the Travel Act.\"  Id. at 741 (emphasis added).  Woodward's argument addresses the \"instead\" portion of the disjunctive, but Woodward offers no basis for reading the highlighted words out of our holding in Sawyer.   The quoted sentence clearly contemplates, not a \"bright line\" or \"either-or\" dichotomy (Def.  Br. at 37-38), but the possibility that a defendant may be prosecuted if he possesses a dual intent, an illegal intent \"in addition\" to a legal \"friendship\" intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, Sawyer's language does not mean what Woodward would like it to mean--that conduct must have an exclusively illegal intent in order to be subject to the criminal laws.  Rather, it means only that conduct may not be subject to the criminal laws if the intent underlying it is exclusively legal.   A defendant may be prosecuted for deprivation of honest services if he has a dual intent, i.e., if he is found to have intended both a lawful and an unlawful purpose to some degree.  If the jury finds that an unlawful purpose was present, it may convict the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Third Circuit reached a similar conclusion in United States v. Greber, 760 F.2d 68, 72 (3d Cir.1985).  As Woodward noted, the jury in Greber \"was instructed similarly to the present case, making any amount of inducement, however small, illegal.\"   Def. Br. at 39 n. 27;  see Greber, 760 F.2d at 72.   In United States v. Bay State Ambulance &amp; Hosp. Rental Serv., Inc., 874 F.2d 20 (1st Cir.1989), we noted that we were \"impressed with the Third Circuit's reasoning\" in Greber.  Bay State, 874 F.2d at 29-30.   Likewise, the Second Circuit has \"noted that there could be dual purposes for payments, stating that a 'valid purpose that partially motivates a transaction does not insulate participants in an unlawful transaction from criminal liability.'   The charge was entirely appropriate in light of [the defendant's] argument that he was motivated by friendship.\"  United States v. Coyne, 4 F.3d 100, 113 (2d Cir.1993) (rejecting challenge to jury instruction that defendant must be found to have accepted or solicited a thing of value \"at least in part\" for or because of his intent to be influenced) (citing Biaggi, 909 F.2d at 683);  see also Anderson v. United States, 417 U.S. 211, 226, 94 S.Ct. 2253, 41 L.Ed.2d 20 (1974) (conspiracy).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, the answer to Woodward's assertion that \"[t]he district court's instruction should ... have parroted Sawyer,\" Def.  Br. at 38, is that, for all relevant purposes, it did.  The district court instructed the jury, inter alia, as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p>You may not find that the defendant violated either set of federal laws which I have described to you if his receipt of the expenditures was solely part of a routine cultivation of a business or political friendship rather than an intent on his part to be influenced in his official legislative duties.  If instead or in addition, there is an intent on the defendant's part to be influenced in his official legislative duties, then you may find a violation of either set of federal laws.  If there is both the intent to cultivate a business and political relationship and the intent to be influenced in official legislative duties, then you may find a violation of the federal laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward would have us go beyond Sawyer in the present case.  He insists that the real issue here is the degree of unlawful intent necessary<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> in a dual intent case to permit or sustain a conviction, and the necessary jury charge on that point.  Woodward argues that the protective instruction we set forth in Sawyer should be modified to say that an illegal purpose must be at least \"one of the [scheme's] several dominant purposes,\" Def.  Br. at 40 (quoting United States v. Ellis, 935 F.2d 385 (1st Cir.1991) (Mann Act)) (emphasis added).  Otherwise, under our reading of Sawyer, a de minimus illegal intent could result in a conviction even if it were dwarfed by a perfectly legal \"friendship\" intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Woodward, the illegal purpose of the gratuity should not be a minor or incidental portion of the mix.  We disagree.  The criminal law may punish conduct even if its illegal purpose is incidental to other, legal purposes.  See Anderson, 417 U.S. at 226, 94 S.Ct. 2253 (holding that the purpose to violate federal law may be a secondary purpose, not necessarily primary);  United States v. Ellis, 595 F.2d 154, 162 (3d Cir.1979) (\"While [Supreme Court cases] require such a specific intent [to violate constitutional rights], they do not require that the immediate intent to violate constitutional rights predominate over the ultimate purposes which that violation is designed to achieve.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will assume nevertheless that Woodward is correct that a conviction should not stand if the illegal intent is de minimus or insignificant.  But this does not mean that the district court erred in failing to give an instruction as to the \"de minimus \" point.  The law may require a certain degree of illegal intent in order to convict, but it does not follow that an explicit instruction on that point is necessary.  In the present case, even if the instructions were not technically adequate because they lacked an explicit \"de minimus \" instruction, Woodward was not prejudiced thereby.  \"An error in jury instructions will warrant reversal of a judgment only if the error is determined to have been prejudicial, based on a review of the record as a whole.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  Davet v. Maccarone, 973 F.2d 22, 26 (1st Cir.1992).  As we have already discussed in Part III, there is no evidentiary basis in this record for Woodward's implicit contention that he had no more than a de minimus degree of intent to defraud the public of his honest services.  Therefore the omission of explicit \"de minimus \" language from the jury instructions--even if erroneous--did not prejudice Woodward, and any error does not warrant reversal of his conviction.  See Davet, 973 F.2d at 26.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V</p>\n    <p>Super Bowl Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward appeals the denial of his motion in limine to exclude evidence that Hancock, through Sawyer, paid for a 1986 trip for Woodward and his wife to the Super Bowl in New Orleans.  The court permitted the government to introduce evidence concerning the Woodwards' receipt of $1,809 worth of airfare, lodging, and tickets to the game.  After admitting such evidence, the court gave a limiting instruction to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward objects that this particular gratuity involved more money and was different in kind than the gratuities on the basis of which he was convicted:  it included payment for airfare and lodging, whereas all other gratuities were limited to meals, golf, and other forms of entertainment.  He also points out that the statute of limitations precludes Woodward from being charged with crimes committed prior to July 27, 1990, and that 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1346 was not even enacted until November 18, 1988.  For these reasons, Woodward claims that the admission of the Super Bowl evidence was of limited probative value, and that whatever probative value it did have was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.  He argues that it should have been excluded under Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Rule 403, \"if the evidence brings unwanted baggage, say, unfair prejudice or a cognizable risk of confusing the jury, and if the baggage's weight substantially overbalances any probative value, then the evidence must be excluded.\"  United States v. Aguilar-Aranceta, 58 F.3d 796, 800 (1st Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \"The damage done to the defense is not a basis for exclusion;  the question under Rule 403 is one of unfair prejudice--not of prejudice alone.\"  United States v. Munoz, 36 F.3d 1229, 1233 (1st Cir.1994) (internal quotation marks omitted).  We review trial court rulings under Rule 403 for abuse of discretion.  See United States v. Fulmer, 108 F.3d 1486, 1497 (1st Cir.1997);  Aguilar-Aranceta, 58 F.3d at 800.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note first that, while Woodward is concerned that this particularly expensive gratuity might prejudice the jury because of its amount, he neglects to mention the coincidence in the timing:  the Super Bowl took place shortly after Woodward became chair of the Insurance Committee,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> which happened to be a position from which he could potentially be of great use to Sawyer and Hancock.  The government argues, with some force, that the Super Bowl gratuity, elaborate as it was, established and set the tone for the ongoing relationship, i.e., a conspiracy to trade valuable gifts for influence, to deprive Woodward's constituents of his honest services.  Once the nature of the relationship was established, ongoing gifts could be given in smaller amounts in order to \"keep the wheels greased.\"   Thus, the Super Bowl evidence has a good deal more probative value than Woodward suggests.  And its prejudicial effect is far less:  accepting tickets to the Super Bowl is not so heinous or outrageous that the jury was likely to be inflamed against Woodward and ignore the arguments presented in his defense,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> thereby risking a conviction based on passion rather than on the evidence.  Cf. United States v. Bartelho, 129 F.3d 663, 677-78 (1st Cir.1997) (affirming admission of plans to escape from prison at trial on bank robbery);  Pitrone, 115 F.3d at 7-8 (admitting evidence of defendant's boasting about 40 prior commissions of the same crime);  United States v.

We observed that the court had instructed the jury, as the district court did here, that these events took place prior to the time indictable under the statute of limitations, but that such evidence was probative of the defendant's (there, Sawyer's) state of mind.  In Sawyer, we did not address the propriety of admitting this evidence because Sawyer had not challenged it as Woodward has here.  In this case, we hold that the district court properly admitted this evidence, to prove Woodward's intent and the nature of the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the jury instructions adequately conveyed to the jury the difference between conduct that is legal and conduct that violates the criminal laws.  The evidence was sufficient to enable a rational jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Woodward was guilty of the four counts on which he was convicted, and no ground for error has been found.  The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The parties dispute whether \"carrying\" means merely signing paperwork, or whether it means advocating or leading the debate for the bill.  As we discuss infra at 60-61, accepting the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict, \"carrying\" implies active involvement rather than merely ministerial paperwork</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Woodward argues, as he did at trial, that expenditures occurring after that date are irrelevant to the charges against him because they \"came after any potential utility of Woodward to the life insurance industry had ended.\"   The jury acquitted him of all substantive charges stemming from gratuities received after the end of 1990</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The evidence relating to 1989 appears to underrepresent the actual amount of gratuities received in that year.  The numerical evidence in the chart came from Sawyer's expense accounts submitted to Hancock for reimbursement.  For years other than 1989, if Woodward participated in a particular event, then Sawyer's expenditure on that event was divided among the number of participants in order to calculate, as closely as possible, the share received by Woodward.  In 1989, for a conference on Amelia Island, Sawyer's records do not reflect which legislators participated in which events.  Therefore it was not clear what share each individual legislator received of the $5,282 of Sawyer's total expenses for the conference.  Thus, although the records reflect that Woodward did share in the total expenditures, the calculation of his annual gratuities for 1989 does not include Woodward's share of the Amelia Island expenses</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> To be more precise, the jury convicted him of five charges, but the district court dismissed one of them as multiplicitous</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> In relevant part, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1341 and 1343 provide:</p>\n        <p>Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises ...

In Cross, the defendants had conspired to fix the outcomes of various judicial proceedings, and the mailings alleged as the basis for the mail fraud conviction were simply the official notices sent by the court to notify the parties of the outcomes of their cases.  The court held that such \"legally required mailings ... cannot be deemed to have been made 'for the purpose of executing' a fraudulent scheme.\"  Id. at 152;  see also id. at 152 n. 4 (distinguishing Schmuck, 489 U.S. at 713 n. 7, 109 S.Ct. 1443, where the mailings \"were a direct result of and would not have occurred but for the fraudulent scheme\").  In the present case, Sawyer's Visa bills were certainly not \"legally required mailings\" that simply informed people of the already completed outcome of the scheme.  Nor would those Visa bills have been mailed \"but for the fraudulent scheme.\"  Cross, 128 F.3d at 152 n. 4</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> The \"effects doctrine\" originated in international law, where it held that a country may regulate conduct occurring outside its territory which causes harmful results within its territory.  See, e.g., Strassheim v. Daily, 221 U.S. 280, 285, 31 S.Ct. 558, 55 L.Ed. 735 (1911);  United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, 148 F.2d 416 (2d Cir.1945).  Under the territorial effects doctrine, jurisdiction exists only when significant effects were intended within the prescribing territory.  Laker Airways Ltd. v. Sabena, Belgian World Airlines, 731 F.2d 909, 923 (D.C.Cir.1984);  Aluminum Co. of America, 148 F.2d at 444.   This jurisdictional concept of international law has been applied to jurisdiction by one state over criminal activities of out-of-state entities which affect the forum state.  See Beneficial Fin.  Co., 275 N.E.2d at 57 n. 8;  cf.  FTC v. Compagnie de Saint-GobainPont-a-Mousson, 636 F.2d 1300, 1317 n. 93 (D.C.Cir.1980).  The effects doctrine has also been applied in determining whether a forum state's courts may exercise personal jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant, via the forum's long-arm statute, without violating the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  See Calder v. Jones, 465 U.S. 783, 788-90, 104 S.Ct. 1482, 79 L.Ed.2d 804 (1984);  Keeton v.

Given the evidence of repeated expenditures, \"a jury could rationally find that [the defendant and his co-conspirators] agreed, at least tacitly, to the pattern of unlawful conduct.  Finally, the jury could also infer that [the defendant and his co-conspirators] knew that the mails and wires would be used to facilitate the entertainment ... (e.g., the mailing of bills related to, and the making of telephone calls to arrange, the entertainment), and that interstate travel in connection with the entertainment (e.g., [expenditures for] out-of-state golf) would or had to occur.\"  Id.

There are other cases involving jury instructions (for example, where the challenge is to the form or wording of the jury instructions) where the district court usually has more latitude and the proper standard of review is for abuse of discretion.  See, e.g., United States v. Gibson, 726 F.2d 869, 874 (1st Cir.1984)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> We note that the district court's instruction on reasonable doubt was questionable.  It stated:  \"Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof that leaves you firmly convinced of the defendant's guilt.  There are very few things, of course, in this world that we know with absolute certainty.  And in criminal cases, the law does not require proof that overcomes every possible doubt.  If, based on your consideration of the evidence, you are firmly convinced that the defendant is guilty of the crime charged, you must find him guilty.  If on the other hand, you think there is a real possibility that he is not guilty, you must give him the benefit of the doubt and find him not guilty.\"</p>\n        <p>Woodward has not appealed this portion of the jury instructions, so plain error review is appropriate.  See Johnson v. United States, 520 U.S. 461, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 1547, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997);  Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).  The district court's instruction survives the high hurdle of plain error review, see Pitrone, 115 F.3d at 4-5, notably because the court gave significant emphasis to the presumption of innocence.</p>\n        <p>Nevertheless, we have previously joined other circuits in criticizing the Federal Judicial Center instruction from which the district court's \"firmly convinced\" language is drawn.  See United States v. Gibson, 726 F.2d 869-874 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 466 U.S. 960, 104 S.Ct. 2174, 80 L.Ed.2d 557 (1984), pointing out that \"reasonable doubt\" definitions have a tendency to provoke unnecessary litigation.  Id. at 874.   We have expressed particular concern that \"many definitions reduce the burden of proof on the government by expanding the degree of doubt permissible, and consequently such definitions result in increased appellate litigation.\"  United States v. Andujar, 49 F.3d 16, 23 (1st Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).  We note that for district courts in this circuit that are inclined to provide further definition for the concept, a reasonably detailed reasonable doubt instruction used by Judge Keeton is set forth verbatim, and expressly approved without qualification, in United States v. Cleveland, 106 F.3d 1056, 1062-63 (1st Cir.1997), aff'd on other grounds, sub nom., Muscarello v.

Francis H. Woodward was first elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1977.  He was assigned to the Joint Committee on Insurance (\"Insurance Committee\"), and served as the Committee's House Chair from January, 1985 through January 19, 1991.  Beginning January 20, 1991 and continuing through April 1992 when he resigned from the legislature, Woodward was assigned to the Transportation Committee, which had no jurisdiction over insurance matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the relevant time period, John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company (\"Hancock\") was one of the two largest life insurance companies in Massachusetts, and one of the ten largest in the entire United States.  Because Hancock is domiciled in Massachusetts and is regulated primarily at the state level, Massachusetts' laws and regulations have a major impact on Hancock, affecting such issues as the corporation's organization and funding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">William Sawyer was the senior legislative counsel in Hancock's Government Relations Department.  He was responsible for lobbying the Massachusetts legislature on behalf of bills favored by Hancock and the industry, and against those bills they opposed.  He actively lobbied the Insurance Committee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hancock was also a member of an industry trade association known as the Life Insurance Association of Massachusetts (\"LIAM\").  LIAM also employed lobbyists who worked on Massachusetts legislation, in coordination with the lobbyists of its member companies.  Sawyer was an active participant in LIAM as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bills filed in the Massachusetts legislature were assigned to committee by subject matter.  The Insurance Committee, comprising eleven representatives and six senators, was one of the principal legislative committees to which legislation of interest to Hancock and LIAM was assigned.  From 1985 through 1990, the Insurance Committee received, on average, three hundred bills a year, one hundred of which affected the life insurance industry.  Of those bills, the industry was interested in passing an average of only five per year;  it opposed the rest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The committee's procedures were, in general, as follows.  First, public hearings were held on the bills.  Following such hearings, the members of the committee voted on the bills in executive sessions that were open to the public.  If the bill received a favorable recommendation in the committee's executive session, it was reported out favorably for further action on the floor of either the House or the Senate.  If it received an unfavorable recommendation or a study order in the committee's executive session vote, then in all likelihood the bill would not pass in that session.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Insurance Committee was co-chaired by one House and one Senate member.  The co-chairs, Woodward and his Senate co-chair, directed the activities of the committee, supervising the committee staff and scheduling all public hearings, executive sessions, and meetings.  As co-chair, Woodward had the authority to assign bills to the hearing calendar and subsequent executive sessions, and to take other action that would help to advance bills through the committee (or he could choose not to take such action).  Woodward also had the authority to affect the disposition of a bill, including the ability to \"carry\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> a bill through the legislative process or to send it to \"study,\" which effectively shelved it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As one of the four most active lobbyists on behalf of domestic life insurance companies, Sawyer was frequently present at Insurance Committee meetings.  He saw Woodward two or three times a week, and was the lobbyist who met most often with Woodward.  After Woodward was removed from the Insurance Committee in January 1991, Sawyer continued to appear at committee meetings and to meet with Woodward's successor as House Chair with the same frequency as he had before.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the heart of the government's case was the evidence of Sawyer's expenditures on Woodward for shared meals and entertainment.  From 1984 through 1992, Woodward accepted in excess of $9,000 in gratuities from Hancock and LIAM through their lobbyists Sawyer and William F. Carroll, the president of LIAM.  Hancock provided the majority of this largesse, at least $8,740 in meals, rounds of golf, and other entertainment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government introduced evidence showing that, from March 28, 1984 through January 23, 1992, Sawyer expended $8,740 on behalf of Woodward.  Of that total, $1,827 was expended after the statute of limitations period began, i.e., after July 27, 1990.  One thousand three hundred forty dollars ($1,340) of the total expenditures occurred after January 19, 1991, when Woodward was removed from the Insurance Committee.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sawyer's expenditures consisted of (1) shared meals and entertainment at conferences, generally once or twice a year;  (2) miscellaneous meals and rounds of golf each year in Massachusetts;  (3) a dinner at the annual Fourth of July social gathering on Cape Cod;  and (4) a trip in January 1986 to the Super Bowl in New Orleans.  Expenditures from categories (1) and (2) are the subject of this appeal on the sufficiency issue.  The jury acquitted Woodward as to category (3) expenditures.  Evidence relating to the Super Bowl was not the subject of the indictment, but was admitted, over Woodward's objection, to show the nature of the conspiracy and for its bearing on intent;  Woodward appeals the admission of that evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The National Conference of Insurance Legislators (COIL) is a national association of state legislators involved in insurance matters.  Every year the organization sponsored one or more conferences for legislators, at various sites around the country, where educational presentations were made concerning insurance matters.  Woodward attended many COIL conferences, as did other legislators from Massachusetts and elsewhere.  Legislators' travel and hotel expenses were paid from a legislative account or campaign funds but not by the insurance industry.  Woodward and Sawyer frequently played golf at exclusive clubs near the conference site, and Sawyer generally paid the costs of the golf.  Sawyer used his corporate credit card to pay for business-related expenses.  He submitted an expense account statement with receipts, and Hancock reimbursed Sawyer for such expenses.  In addition, Sawyer paid for a number of dinners at local restaurants that would be attended by legislators such as Woodward who were attending the conferences.  At times, William Carroll of LIAM would pay for the dinners.  Sawyer/Hancock also paid for Woodward's entertainment while at these conferences, such as tickets for the Grand Ole Opry when the conference was in Nashville.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the COIL conference expenditures, Sawyer paid for Woodward's meals at expensive restaurants, as early as 1984, when Woodward was in the Legislature but before Woodward served as co-chair of the Insurance Committee.  This practice continued throughout the years Woodward remained in the House, with higher amounts generally in the years he was committee chair.  Sawyer also paid for an average of three to five golf outings with Woodward each year at various locations in Massachusetts.  These were principally at Sawyer's private golf club, the Woodland Golf Club.  Hancock also paid for other forms of entertainment, including boat rentals and tickets to tourist attractions such as Busch Gardens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government introduced into evidence a chart showing the amount of annual gratuities accepted by Woodward.  The pattern formed by these amounts is noteworthy.  In 1984 and 1985, before Woodward became chair of the Committee and for the first year afterward, Woodward accepted gratuities in the range of $200-300 from Sawyer/Hancock.  In 1986 there was a marked increase to $2,527, including over $1,800 to cover the air fare, hotel, and tickets (for him and his wife) to attend the Super Bowl in New Orleans.  In 1987-91, Woodward received gratuities in the amount of $1,547, $1,093, $513<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>, $1,230, and $1,324.  Woodward served as committee chair during all but the last of these years.  During his last four months in the legislature, January through April 1992, he received only $16, and his gratuities dropped to $0 after he resigned from office in April.  After Woodward was replaced as committee chair by Rep.  Francis Mara, Sawyer began wining and dining Mara in the same manner as he had Woodward.

These amounted to $444.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward's official actions, for the most part, conformed with the way Sawyer and Hancock wanted the recipient of their gratuities to conduct himself.  Sawyer was the lobbyist with whom Woodward met the most, according to Robert J. Smith, the research director for the Insurance Committee.  They met approximately three times a week when the legislature was in session.  And Woodward repeatedly acted on behalf of Hancock and the life insurance industry in his capacity as co-chair of the Committee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Smith, Woodward was the most pro-life-insurance-industry chair of the Insurance Committee during Smith's tenure, 1985-95 (which included six other House and Senate chairs).  Woodward actively supported the industry's position on most bills of importance to the industry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As his defense to the charge that he engaged in illegal theft of honest services, Woodward presented evidence that Sawyer's expenditures on his behalf were based not on bribery but on their \"close\" friendship.  In addition to their business relationship, Woodward and Sawyer maintained a personal relationship.  They met in the late 1970s, which is the time Woodward began serving on the Insurance Committee.  The two families socialized together even before Woodward assumed the chair of the Committee in 1984.  The two couples drove together to a conference in New York in 1980, and the Sawyers and their children visited the Woodwards at the latter's house on Cape Cod as early as 1982.  Beginning in about 1984, the Sawyers would traditionally stay at the Woodwards' house on the Cape for an annual Fourth of July weekend gathering.  The two families also shared other times, including family celebrations and tragedies.  Mrs. Woodward testified that the Sawyers were one of three couples with whom the Woodwards were the closest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury convicted Woodward of four<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> (of the twenty-eight) charges against him:  one count each of mail and wire fraud, one count of interstate travel to commit bribery, and one count of conspiracy to commit the foregoing three offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>Requisite Intent Under Mail and Wire Fraud Statutes</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To support a conviction for mail or wire fraud, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt:  \"(1) the defendant's knowing and willing participation in a scheme or artifice to defraud with the specific intent to defraud, and (2) the use of the mails or interstate wire communications in furtherance of the scheme.\"  Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 723;  see 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1341, 1343.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  \"[T]he term 'scheme or artifice to defraud' includes a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 1346;  see Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 723-24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government charged that Woodward engaged in a scheme to deprive the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and its citizens (collectively, \"the public\" or \"citizenry\") of their right to his honest services as a state legislator, performed free from deceit, fraud, dishonesty, conflict of interest, and self-enrichment.  In addition to this general duty of honest services, the government charged that Woodward had a specific duty to abide by Massachusetts reporting requirements.  With regard to the scheme to defraud, the government charged, inter alia, that Woodward accepted, from individuals (including Sawyer) representing Hancock and LIAM, golf, meals, tickets, and other entertainment and benefits, in violation of Massachusetts law;  that Woodward filed false Statements of Financial Interest (\"SFI\") under oath, in which he unlawfully failed to report to the State Ethics Commission his receipt of the gratuities;  that Sawyer on behalf of Hancock and LIAM was given greater access to the Insurance Committee and to Woodward as House Chair than was available generally to the citizenry;  and that, from 1984 through 1990, Woodward repeatedly performed official acts on behalf of Hancock and LIAM.  The government further charged that Woodward used the mails and interstate telephone wires in furtherance of the scheme, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1341 and 1343.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Sawyer, we discussed mail and wire fraud in connection with theft of honest services in a closely analogous situation where the same facts formed the backdrop for the case.  We particularly highlighted the intent required to support a conviction;  intent is also a major issue in the present case.  But as Woodward stresses, his situation--as the legislator--is not exactly identical to that of Sawyer as the lobbyist.  We will, therefore, summarize our analysis in Sawyer, insofar as is applicable here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We explained that, prior to Sawyer, honest services fraud had typically been found in two types of circumstances:  (1) bribery, where a legislator was paid for a particular decision or action, or (2) failure to disclose a conflict of interest, resulting in personal gain.  85 F.3d at 724.   As to the latter, we noted that \"[a] public official has an affirmative duty to disclose material information to the public employer.  When an official fails to disclose a personal interest in a matter over which she has decision-making power, the public is deprived of its right either to disinterested decision making itself or, as the case may be, to full disclosure as to the official's potential motivation.\"  Id. (citing United States v. Silvano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"483811\"><a href=\"/opinion/483811/united-states-v-joseph-silvano-jr-united-states-of-america-v-william/\"><span class=\"volume\">812</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">754</span></a></span>, 759 (1st Cir.1987)).  \"Thus, undisclosed, biased decision making for personal gain, whether or not tangible loss to the public is shown, constitutes a deprivation of honest services.\"  Id. The Sawyer case expanded category (1) from quid pro quo bribery, to include a more generalized pattern of gratuities to coax \"ongoing favorable official action.\"  Id. at 730;  see infra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The broad scope of the mail fraud statute, however, does not encompass every instance of official misconduct,\" even of \"reprehensible misconduct,\" \"that results in the official's personal gain.\"  Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 725.   The government must prove that the defendant intended to deprive the public of its right to the honest services of its legislators.  Id. at 725, 730.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>This intent could be shown in a number of ways.  For example, a bribery-like, corrupt intent to influence official action necessarily is an intent to deprive the public of an official's honest services.  A person might not, however, give an unlawful gratuity with the intent to effect a specific quid pro quo.  Rather, as the government contends here, a person with continuing and long-term interests before an official might engage in a pattern of repeated, intentional gratuity offenses in order to coax ongoing favorable official action in derogation of the public's right to impartial official services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 730 (noting that \"[s]uch conduct would be akin to (although not a classic case of) the conflict of interest cases noted\" previously).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying this principle to the facts adduced, we stated that, \"while Sawyer may not have provided the legislators with direct kickbacks or commissions arising out of the specific official action, he may have intended the legislators generally to treat preferentially Hancock's interests, knowing that the free meals, entertainment, and golf would continue so long as favorable official acts were, at some point, taken.\"  Id.  We reversed the mail and wire fraud convictions, nevertheless, because we could not be sure that the jury convicted Sawyer based upon the Massachusetts gift statute (as a basis for the federal scheme to defraud) or the Massachusetts gratuity statute, and the former had been improperly charged in the court's instructions to the jury.  We mandated a protective instruction to be used in cases such as this, which would help the jury understand the difference between \"reprehensible misconduct\" which is not a violation of federal law, and misconduct which does form the basis for a federal conviction.  Id. at 741.   Noting that prior cases usually involved \"quid pro quo bribery or blatant conflict of interest,\" which was clearly illegal, we distinguished Sawyer's gratuities to Woodward (and other legislators) as involving conduct which \"itself may not be very different, except in degree, from routine cultivation of friendship in a lobbying context,\" which does not violate federal criminal law.  Id. We noted that \"[t]he practice of using hospitality, including lavish hospitality, to cultivate business or political relationships is longstanding and pervasive.\"  Id. Because the \"difference between lawful and unlawful turns primarily on intent,\" we held that the court must instruct the jury that a lobbyist does not commit honest services fraud or violate the Travel Act if his \"intent was limited to the cultivation of business or political friendship.\"  Id. He commits those violations \"only if instead or in addition, there is an intent to cause the recipient to alter her official acts.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward's principal argument on appeal is that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that he had the requisite intent on any of the four counts at issue here.  We will focus our discussion here on the mail and wire fraud counts.  We held in Sawyer that the intent required for a Travel Act violation is the same as that for mail and wire fraud.  85 F.3d at 741.   Woodward argues that the conspiracy count must fall because there is insufficient evidence to support the substantive counts that served as its objects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because theft of honest services constitutes a \"scheme or artifice to defraud\" within the meaning of the mail and wire fraud statutes, see Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 723-24, the question becomes whether the jury could reasonably have found that Woodward intended to steal his honest services from the public.

We noted that Sawyer continually gave gifts for the purposes of gaining access and developing a relationship with Woodward and other legislators.  From this, the jury could have inferred that Sawyer intended to induce official actions favorable to Hancock's interests.  Id.;  see also id. at 739 (noting that Sawyer gave items of substantial value to legislators like Woodward who had the ability to take official action favorable to Hancock, that those gifts ceased after the legislators left office, and that Sawyer had long-term ongoing interests in official actions and knew the gratuities were illegal;  and concluding that the jury could rationally have inferred that \"the gratuities were motivated by the legislators' performance of official duties, i.e., that they were given 'for or because of any official act,' within the meaning of the Massachusetts gratuity statute, Mass.

In Sawyer, of course, the jury was assessing the motivation of the donor of the gratuity, Sawyer, not that of the donee, Woodward.  But it is an equally valid inference, from the foregoing evidence coupled with the fact that Sawyer and Woodward spent a good amount of time together, that Woodward understood the gratuities and their purpose in the same way that his \"close friend\" Sawyer did.  Woodward knew that Sawyer was giving him items of substantial value, continuing over a long period of time;  he knew that Sawyer had a long-term ongoing interest in his official acts;  and that he had the ability to take official action favorable to Hancock.  Woodward also knew that his relationship with Sawyer began after he became a member of the Insurance Committee and that the gifts increased substantially shortly after he became chair of the committee that handled insurance legislation.  Finally, Woodward knew that, at many of the same entertainment events that he enjoyed, Sawyer also wined and dined other legislators in a similar manner, and those legislators had only a business relationship, not a friendship, with Sawyer.  In light of all this, the jury could have inferred that Woodward knew what the deal was--that the gratuities would continue as long as he voted favorably to Hancock's interests, see Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 730--and that he intended to be influenced by the gratuities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the jury had additional evidentiary bases for drawing the inference that Woodward's intent included an illegal element rather than being solely based on friendship.  After entertaining Woodward for several days at the Scottsdale COIL conference in 1991, Sawyer left the conference early, but left his credit card to be used for paying Woodward's golf and meal expenses during the remainder of the conference.  This is not consistent with mere friendship as the sole purpose of the payments, but rather is more consistent with the theory of a gratuity made because of Woodward's potential official actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, Woodward received some gratuities from Sawyer (although in lesser amounts) at events where other legislators--mostly members of the Insurance Committee, who could also influence legislative acts in favor of Hancock--were also present.  This too indicates an illegal gratuity more than the camaraderie of \"close friends.\"   Similarly, some of Woodward's gratuities came from LIAM, through its president, Carroll, who was not a personal friend of Woodward's.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same inference can be drawn from the fact that the expenditures were not mutual but rather operated in one direction only.  The standard operating procedure was for Sawyer to pay for meals, drinks and golf for Woodward;  Woodward did not make similar payments for Sawyer.  If the reason Sawyer \"picked up the tab\" for Woodward on some occasions was simply because the two men were \"close friends,\" one would expect there to be a roughly equal number of occasions on which Woodward \"picked up the tab\" for Sawyer.  But that was not the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, the only evidence in the record as to Woodward performing some reciprocal acts of treating his \"close friend\" Sawyer were the weekends spent on Cape Cod.  On those occasions, Woodward invited the Sawyers to stay at the Woodward family's house on the Cape, where the Woodwards cooked some meals.  In return, according to Woodward, Sawyer would pay for a group dinner at a nearby restaurant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Significantly, the jury returned not guilty verdicts on all indictments alleging such reciprocal expenditures.  In contrast, the jury weighed the evidence differently as to four counts charging Woodward with accepting gratuities in a non-mutual, non-reciprocal way.  As to these, the jury apparently viewed Sawyer's expenditures and Woodward's acceptance of them as not being based on the two men's friendship but rather based on a business relationship:  i.e., insurance industry lobbyist and Chair of the Legislature's Insurance Committee.  The jury recognized--and this recognition is supported by the evidence of record--that the two men had two types of relationships, a personal friendship and a business relationship.  Woodward's acceptance of expenditures that were part of their friendship was not illegal, but his acceptance of expenditures in the context of their business relationship constituted theft of the honest services that Woodward owed to his constituents.  We think the evidence was sufficient for a reasonable juror to so conclude beyond a reasonable doubt.  The jury was free to \"choose among the reasonable alternatives posed by the evidence,\" Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 733, and we will not second-guess the jury's conclusion in this regard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another reason the jury could have rejected Woodward's contention that Sawyer picked up his tab solely because of friendship rather than as an attempt to influence is the direct statements showing how Woodward expected to receive gratuities from Sawyer (and, through him, from Hancock).  In 1989, at a COIL conference in Florida, Lorraine Bohannon, the former staff director of the Insurance Committee, who reported directly to Woodward, went out to dinner with Woodward, Sawyer, and their spouses.  There is no evidence that Bohannon had any kind of personal friendship with Sawyer.  After dinner, Bohannon offered to Woodward to pay a portion of the bill, and Woodward's response was:  \"Don't worry about it;  it's taken care of.\"   Sawyer picked up the tab and was reimbursed by Hancock for the bill.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government presented evidence of another direct statement to demonstrate Woodward's illegal intent.  After Woodward left the legislature, he expressed interest in working for Hancock as a lobbyist.  He asked Sawyer to help him obtain the job.  Sawyer told Woodward he was not qualified for the job, and Woodward was \"very hurt.\"   Subsequently when he talked to Committee research director Robert Smith about the Hancock job, Woodward said, in effect, \"After all I did for Bill Sawyer, you know, I can't believe he's not--he can't get me a job\" or \"he's not getting me a job.\"   The prosecutor asked Smith whether Woodward told him what \"he felt he had done for Bill Sawyer,\" and Smith replied, \"Not specifically, just generally.  'After all these years as Chairman of the committee and trying to do the right thing and being willing to take on tough issues, I would--I expected, you know, more assistance than I received.' \"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward argues that this conversation does not demonstrate any illegal intent on Woodward's part.  He points out that, at trial, Smith could not recall Woodward saying \"after all I've done for Sawyer,\" but only \"after all I've done.\"   Woodward also notes that \"trying to do the right thing\" could have meant following his own conscience, not necessarily doing the \"right thing\" for Sawyer and Hancock.  Similarly, \"taking on tough issues\" did not necessarily mean \"taking on tough issues\" for Sawyer or Hancock.  At trial, Smith testified that he did not interpret these phrases in an illegal manner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But Woodward's argument is belied by the totality of Smith's testimony about the conversation, or at least a reasonable jury could have so inferred.  In his grand jury testimony, which was used by the government at trial, Smith testified to the more directly inculpatory language:  \"after all I did for Bill Sawyer.\"   And Smith's trial testimony covered additional incriminating evidence that Smith had revealed to the grand jury but did not include in his direct testimony at trial.  When asked (at the grand jury session) to repeat the whole conversation, Smith testified:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p>[Woodward] said that he had spoken to Bill Sawyer and that Bill Sawyer had been reluctant to help him, and Representative Woodward at that time--as many legislators do, they don't remember the specific bill numbers or subject matter, but they'll remember in general if they were favorable towards someone or not--said to me \"you would think after all the years and everything I've done I would be treated better than I have been treated.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This juxtaposition of the \"everything I've done\" language with the notion of legislators \"remember[ing] in general if they were favorable towards someone or not\" carries a strong implication that, at least in Smith's mind as he heard Woodward make the quoted statements, Woodward's reference to \"all he had done\" was meant in the sense of taking action in the legislature to favor Sawyer and Hancock's interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith's grand jury testimony, elicited after an inconsistent statement at the trial, constitutes substantive evidence under Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(1)(A).  The jury, in assessing Smith's credibility in the context of all his testimony, could well have believed that Smith's grand jury testimony--with its incriminating inferences--was true;  and the jury could have concluded that Smith's trial testimony was not believable to the extent it undercut the grand jury testimony.  On appeal, of course, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, not the light most favorable to Woodward.  Credibility assessments are properly left to the jury.  United States v. Mangual-Corchado, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"752407\"><a href=\"/opinion/752407/united-states-v-saul-mangual-corchado-united-states-of-america-v-ernesto/\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 43 n. 20 (1st Cir.1998).  And juries are not required to evaluate the evidence in isolation;  \"individual pieces of evidence, insufficient in themselves to prove a point, may in cumulation prove it.\"  Bourjaily, 483 U.S. at 179-80, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111938\"><a href=\"/opinion/111938/bourjaily-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

According to Smith's trial testimony, Woodward said:  \"If he [Woodward] could not get the job himself he'd like to see his son Brian get the job.\"   Smith testified that he was unaware of any experience that Woodward's son, Brian, had in insurance matters.  This, too, carries the implication that Woodward was expecting some kind of reward from Sawyer/Hancock for all his years of favoring the industry's position in the legislature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, as Woodward recognizes, \"[i]ntent can be inferred from a defendant's conduct, viewed in light of all the surrounding circumstances.\"   Def. Br. at 19;  see, e.g., Gaunt v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"225686\"><a href=\"/opinion/225686/gaunt-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">184</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">284</span></a></span>, 290-91 (1st Cir.1950).  Thus \"[t]he best evidence of Woodward's intent to perform official acts to favor Hancock's (and LIAM's) interests is the evidence of Woodward's actions on bills which were important to Hancock.\"  Id. Unfortunately for Woodward, the evidence supports the jury's verdict, rather than undermining it as he contends.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not necessary for the government to link a particular gratuity with a specific act in order to obtain a conviction.  Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 738-39;  see discussion supra at p. 55.   Nevertheless, Woodward disputes the extent to which, in his official capacity as chair of the Insurance Committee, he took action that served the interests of his benefactors.  The evidence does not support his contention.  According to Robert Smith, Woodward was the most pro-life-insurance-industry chair of the Committee, of the seven House and Senate chairs with whom Smith worked during the ten years that Smith served as the Committee's research director.  Woodward even took pro-industry positions in opposition to his own committee.  As an example, in each year from 1985 through 1990, the legislature considered a bill proposing mandatory discounts on life insurance for non-smokers.  Hancock and LIAM opposed the bill.  In 1989, the bill received favorable recommendation from the Insurance Committee based on support from Senator Linda Melconian, Woodward's co-chair of the Committee.  But despite the Committee's favorable report, Woodward led the opposition to the bill in debate before the full House of Representatives, and was successful in defeating the so-called \"non-smoker's bill\" for that session.  Hancock's vice-president, who directly supervised Sawyer, called the bill's defeat a \"significant victory for the industry.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward also led the Insurance Committee to support and report favorably bills proposed by the industry.  Among these were bills allowing life insurance companies to change the ways in which they valued real estate assets, to adjust pension funds, to provide financial services, and to be flexible in corporate governance and finance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, more than any other co-chair from 1985-95, Woodward \"carried\" bills sought by the life insurance industry.  This means that, after the bill left the committee, Woodward served as the point person to push these bills through the legislative process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward challenges this characterization of the meaning of \"carrying\" a bill after it leaves committee.  Woodward contends that \"carrying\" is merely a ministerial function, that it simply refers to the fact that the chair of any committee of the Massachusetts legislature \"sign[s] the paperwork recommending a bill favorably and [is] available to answer questions from non-committee legislators when [the bill is] presented to the House or Senate floor.\"   Woodward relies on Robert Smith's testimony for the proposition that carrying legislation does not necessarily mean advocating or leading the debate for the bill on the House floor, that that role is normally reserved for the legislator who sponsors the bill.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith's testimony to this effect, however, was impeached with his grand jury testimony in which he had testified that \"carrying\" meant actively guiding bills through the legislative process.  As we noted in discussing the conversations about getting Woodward a job at Hancock, the jury was entitled to believe this portion of Smith's testimony (i.e., introduction at trial of his prior grand jury testimony)--that \"carrying\" means actively guiding a bill through the process;  it is not merely ministerial--and the jury was entitled to disbelieve other parts of his trial testimony that supported Woodward's interpretation to the contrary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward points to thirty-one (31) bills that he supported despite opposition on the part of Hancock and the insurance industry.  But, as the government notes, the proper analysis is to examine all bills considered by the Committee in context, not to isolate a relatively small number of bills in an effort to show that Woodward was not 100% in the industry's pocket.  The record reflects that, during his six years as co-chair of the Insurance Committee, there were approximately one hundred bills per year that were of interest to the life insurance industry, for a total of six hundred bills during his tenure.  Woodward opposed the industry's position on only thirty-one of those bills.  Moreover, at least ten of the opposed bills were duplicates of previously filed bills.  Of the remainder, only three actually related to life insurance.  The rest concerned mandated benefits for health insurance which were of less importance to the life insurance industry, in particular to Hancock.  This is because, as Hancock's attorney testified, life insurance was Hancock's \"big money earner in terms of profit.\"   The company's group health insurance business was \"[o]ne of the lesser profit earners.\"   As already noted, several of the bills where Woodward's position conformed to the life insurance industry's positions were of great importance to the industry in that the bills significantly improved the industry's profitability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward relies heavily on Czubinski, 106 F.3d at 1076, where we cited Sawyer for the \"most important[ ]\" proposition that the government must do more than \"merely indicate wrongdoing by a public official, but must also demonstrate that the wrongdoing at issue [was] intended to prevent or call into question the proper or impartial performance of that public servant's official duties.\"  Czubinski, 106 F.3d at 1076 (citing Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 725).   In Czubinski, we explained that Czubinski's \"case falls outside of the core of honest services fraud precedents,\" in that he was \"not bribed or otherwise influenced in any public decisionmaking capacity.\"  Id. at 1077.   We also distinguished Czubinski's \"relatively straightforward\" job--responding to information requests from the public--from \"a discretionary, decision-making role,\" which \"raise[s] the specter of secretive, self-interested action.\".  Id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> We found \"no evidence that Congress intended to create what amounts to a draconian personnel regulation,\" by \"transforming governmental workplace violations into [federal] felonies.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The instant case is very different from Czubinski.   As Woodward recognizes, Czubinski did not receive or intend to receive any tangible benefit from his conduct, whereas Woodward did.  Additionally, Czubinski's official duties did not involve the discretionary, decision-making role of a legislator.  \"Notwithstanding these factual differences,\" Woodward asserts, \"Czubinski and the instant case are similarly flawed by the failure of proof on the critical fraudulent intent element.\"   We disagree.  As discussed supra, the jury in the present case could justifiably have inferred the fraudulent intent element. Woodward did receive tangible benefits here, as Czubinski had not.  And the connection between the gratuities and Woodward's official acts could have been justifiably inferred from the fact that Woodward had discretion to act or not act in ways that would further the insurance industry's interests;  this discretion extended both to the bottom line (support of or opposition to the industry's position on legislation) and to the degree of vigor with which Woodward championed the industry's positions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p>2. Failure to Disclose Conflicts of Interest</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to demonstrating Woodward's intent by evidence showing that he was influenced or otherwise improperly affected in performing his duties, the government argues that Woodward's intent is also demonstrated by his failure to disclose his conflict of interest although he was required to do so.  We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts law mandates such disclosure on his Statements of Financial Interest (SFIs).  Mass. Gen. Laws ch.  268B, &#167; 5 (West 1990).  In addition, separate and apart from the state statute, \"[t]he obligation to disclose material information inheres in the legislator's general fiduciary duty to the public.\"  Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 733 n. 17.  We recognized in Sawyer that the nondisclosure of a conflict of interest is a second way in which a public official can steal his honest services.  85 F.3d at 724;  cf. id. at 728 (\"[U]nlike the honest services fraud cases, noted above, in which an official was bribed or took official action based on a secret conflict of interest, a gift statute violation, even if intentional, does not itself amount to honest services fraud.\"  (Emphasis added)).  The evidence of Woodward's non-disclosure is also probative of Woodward's intent;  it supports the jury's finding that he had the requisite intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">As we stated in Sawyer:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p>A public official has an affirmative duty to disclose material information to the public employer.  When an official fails to disclose a personal interest in a matter over which she has decision-making power, the public is deprived of its right either to disinterested decision making itself or, as the case may be, to full disclosure as to the official's potential motivation behind an official act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 724 (citing Silvano, 812 F.2d at 759).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the general \"affirmative duty to disclose\" discussed in Sawyer, Woodward had a specific statutory duty each year to file a Statement of Financial Interests with the Massachusetts State Ethics Commission.  See Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  268B, &#167; 5.  Woodward was required to disclose on his SFI forms all gifts he or his immediate family received, aggregating more than $100 per year, from lobbyists or businesses that had a direct interest in legislation.  He had to sign the forms under oath.  Woodward did not report the gratuities he received from Hancock or LIAM on any of his SFI forms submitted for the years 1984 through 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward contends that his failure to comply with the Massachusetts reporting statute, while \"reprehensible,\" is not relevant here.  We disagree.  In Czubinski, we listed \"the failure of public decision-makers to disclose certain conflicts of interest\" as one of three examples of \"serious corruption\" on the part of public officials that would \"typically\" justify an honest services conviction.  106 F.3d at 1076.   Woodward's failure to report supports the implication that Woodward was aware that these gratuities were improper, especially in light of the fact that \"[m]uch of his entertainment ... took place out-of-state--usually at industry and legislative conferences--where members of the Massachusetts citizenry generally would not observe the questionable activities.\"  Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 733.   Woodward had every incentive to keep these \"questionable activities\" secret from the public by not disclosing them on his SFIs.  The SFIs are public documents, which are frequently scrutinized by the press and political opponents during election years.  In fact, the only gift Woodward ever reported was a local, public golf tournament sponsored by Massachusetts Candy &amp; Tobacco Distributors, Inc., which he reported after learning that the tournament was under investigation by the State Ethics Commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the government that Woodward's intentional failure to disclose the Hancock and LIAM gifts in itself provides a solid basis for the jury to find that Woodward had the requisite intent to deprive the public of his honest services.  This same evidence also supports the finding that Woodward had the intent to deceive necessary for a mail and wire fraud conviction.  See supra at 55, n. 6. \"[A]n official's intentional violation of the duty to disclose provides the requisite 'deceit.' \"  Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 732 (quoting Silvano, 812 F.2d at 760).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewing the record in the light most favorable to the verdict, a rational jury could have found the requisite intent from the trial evidence.  The evidence was sufficient for a rational juror to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Woodward accepted gratuities from Sawyer with the intent to defraud the public of its right to his honest services, and that he had the specific intent to deceive.  See also Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 742 (finding that the evidence adduced there \"would be adequate to infer improper intent\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C</p>\n    <p>Other Elements of Wire Fraud (Count 9)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted supra, to support a conviction for mail or wire fraud, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt:  \"(1) the defendant's knowing and willing participation in a scheme or artifice to defraud with the specific intent to defraud, and (2) the use of the mails or interstate wire communications in furtherance of the scheme.\"  Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 723;  see 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341, 1343.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward also challenges his convictions based on the second requirement.

Woodward could reasonably have foreseen that the hotel reservations in Florida would be made by phone either by Sawyer or by someone acting on his behalf.  That Sawyer could conceivably have made his room reservation in person or by mail does not undermine the foreseeability of a telephone call.  The jury was entitled to use its common sense to infer that a reasonable person would have foreseen a telephonic reservation, as a means commonly employed in the business world for transactions of this type.  Thus, the jury was entitled to conclude, based on the evidence presented, that Woodward \"caused\" the wiring.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward further argues that \"the evidence presented was insufficient to show that the purpose of this call was to execute a scheme by Woodward to deprive the public of its right to his honest services by receiving gratuities from Sawyer with the intent to favor unlawfully Hancock's legislative interests.\"   Def. Br. at 27.  We disagree.  The jury could reasonably have concluded that the call was made in furtherance of the scheme to defraud.  Sawyer would not have been able to give Woodward the illegal gratuities during the COIL conference if Sawyer did not have a hotel room in which to stay for the four days of the conference.  The call in question secured that room, and thus played an essential role in the scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion is buttressed by decisions involving mail fraud, which is analogous to wire fraud for these purposes.

We reasoned that \"the federal mail fraud statute sweeps broadly and its prohibitions extend to the use of the mails by corrupt local government officials.

According to Woodward, because the mailing took place some three to four weeks after Sawyer purchased the meals and entertainment for Woodward, the use of the mail was \"a result of\" the fraudulent scheme but not \"for the purpose of executing\" the scheme.  Id.

His contention assumes a new fraudulent scheme began and ended every time Sawyer used his credit card to pick up the tab for Woodward.  On the contrary, the evidence supported the conclusion that the fraudulent scheme in which Woodward and Sawyer participated was an ongoing scheme, lasting for years and involving Sawyer's use of his credit card.  Every month, Visa would use the mails to bill Sawyer for his charges;  if Sawyer did not pay those bills, his credit line would have been terminated and the gratuities could not have continued as Woodward and Sawyer expected.  It was thus a necessary part of the ongoing scheme that Sawyer pay his bill after receiving it in the mail.  See Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 730 (\"[A] person with continuing and long-term interests before an official might engage in a pattern of repeated, intentional gratuity offenses in order to coax ongoing favorable official action in derogation of the public's right to impartial official services.\")   This case is therefore distinguishable from Maze, where the mailing involved only a post-fraud accounting among victims, after the defendant's fraudulent use of credit cards was already completed.

Gen. Laws ch.  268A, &#167; 3 (West 1990));  and (3) followed by performance or attempted performance of acts in furtherance of the unlawful activity.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1952;  United States v. Arruda, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"423901\"><a href=\"/opinion/423901/united-states-v-john-m-arruda-united-states-of-america-v-edward/\"><span class=\"volume\">715</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">671</span></a></span>, 681 (1st Cir.1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward argues that the evidence supporting the Travel Act conviction was deficient in four respects.  First, he argues that the evidence was insufficient to establish the requisite criminal intent to violate 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1952.  We disagree, for the same reasons discussed in Part III(B), supra, in relation to his intent under the mail and wire fraud statutes.  See Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 741 (equating intent requirements of mail and wire fraud statutes with that required under Travel Act).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Woodward maintains that, in order to prove a violation of the Travel Act, the government had to prove that Woodward violated the bribery laws of Florida.  The Travel Act punishes traveling in interstate commerce for the purpose of carrying on any unlawful activity;  such activity encompasses the commission of bribery \"in violation of the laws of the state in which committed or of the United States.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 1952(b)(2).  The indictment incorporates the Massachusetts gratuity statute, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  268A, &#167; 3, as the underlying bribery offense.  Woodward contends that the bribery, if any, took place only in Florida, and therefore, without evidence of any Florida bribery statute, the Travel Act conviction must be reversed.  This argument is unavailing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Travel Act \"does not require the government to prove that the alleged 'unlawful activity' violates the laws of the state ultimately traveled to,\" or of the state where money actually changed hands.  United States v. Walsh, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"414454\"><a href=\"/opinion/414454/united-states-v-charles-t-walsh-and-bowe-walsh-associates/\"><span class=\"volume\">700</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">846</span></a></span>, 854-55 (2d Cir.1983) (mayor of city in New Jersey agreed in New Jersey to accept bribe and traveled to New York to collect it);  see United States v.

A conviction may be sustained where the evidence demonstrates \"unlawful activity\" in violation of the laws of the state where the effects of the fraudulent scheme are felt, in this case, the state whose citizens are defrauded of their legislator's honest services.  See Walsh, 700 F.2d at 854-55.   Here, Woodward is a legislator from Massachusetts, and the jury could have concluded that the gratuity, though paid in Florida, was paid for the purpose of influencing legislative activities in and affecting Massachusetts.  As we discuss below, that is sufficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward's third challenge to his Travel Act conviction involves timing.  He asserts that there was no evidence that Woodward performed any acts in furtherance of the unlawful activity after the interstate travel on November 24, 1990, as alleged in the indictment.  Woodward notes that, although the Travel Act requires such, the Massachusetts gratuity statute does not require any subsequent activity to be taken in Massachusetts after the Florida bribe.  As evidence of Woodward's post-gratuity activity, the government points to Woodward's action with respect to S. 641, which proposed premium reductions in life insurance for policyholders who were non-smokers.  The bill was originally reported favorably out of the Insurance Committee on May 7, 1990.  Then on July 24, 1990, just before becoming law, the House of Representatives recommitted the bill to the Insurance Committee.  The effect of a bill's recommittal is that both chairs would have to act in order for the bill to be released.  The bill languished in the Insurance Committee with no further action taken through January 1, 1991, after Woodward received the Florida gratuities and prior to his removal as co-chair.  Woodward's co-chair, Senator Melconian, had actively supported the 1989 bill by requesting a favorable recommendation from the Insurance Committee.  The jury could, therefore, reasonably have inferred that Woodward prevented any further action on S. 641, because in the previous year he led the floor debate, on behalf of Hancock and LIAM, against a similar non-smokers bill.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward's receipt of the gratuities in Florida and the subsequent recommittal of S. 641 through January 1991 provided sufficient evidence to allow the jury to find that Woodward performed an act in furtherance of the unlawful activity after the travel to Florida on November 24, 1990.  Arruda, 715 F.2d at 682.   Woodward's timing argument thus fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward's fourth argument against his Travel Act conviction is that \"the payment of the 'bribe' in Florida\" has such an \"attenuated relationship to Massachusetts\" that it would violate the \"effects doctrine.\"   Def. Br. at 32.  \"Under this doctrine, a sovereign only possesses jurisdiction to prosecute a crime where, inter alia, 'the effect within the territory is substantial.' \"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Id.

Gen. Laws ch.  268A, &#167; 3.  \"The concern behind the gratuity statute, like the bribery statute, is the potential undermining of official integrity.\"  Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 735 (emphasis added).  Indeed, when someone gives a stream of illegal gratuities to a public official, a sense of being beholden to the giver's interests is exactly the kind of influence that the giver is trying to develop.  See id. at 730.   The potential effect on Massachusetts when one of its own legislators accepts gratuities out-of-state paid by someone with an interest in Massachusetts legislation is a sufficient nexus to satisfy the effects test and give Massachusetts jurisdiction to prohibit such conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Besides this potential effect, of course, Woodward's receipt of gratuities in Florida was linked also to his official acts in Massachusetts.  Among these acts is his recommittal of a particular bill, Senate Bill 641 (S.641), shortly after he returned from Florida, as already discussed.  And they also included his prior acts to champion the insurance industry's positions in the Legislature.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Woodward violated the Massachusetts gratuity statute, a prerequisite for his Travel Act violation, because he received something of \"substantial value ... for or because of any official act ... performed or to be performed by him.\"   Mass.

We have already discussed our view that the evidence was sufficient to establish the linkage beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward's Florida gratuity was closely enough related to Massachusetts that his \"effects doctrine\" argument must fail.

The phrase \"mixed motive\" was apparently meant as shorthand for the dual intent that might be supportable by the evidence in this case:  the jury could have concluded (1) that Woodward accepted expenditures based on his legitimate friendship with Sawyer, or (2) that these were unlawful expenditures to influence official action (or some combination of the two).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward argues that our decision in Sawyer intended to draw a bright line between \"the merely unattractive and actual criminal conduct.\"  Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 741.   On one side of the line, according to Woodward, is conduct that is \"unattractive\" or even \"reprehensible\" but is not illegal as a matter of federal criminal law.  This would include lavish hospitality if intended to cultivate business or political relationships or friendships.  On the other side of the line is illegal expenditures, i.e., those by lobbyists intended \"to cause the recipient to alter her official acts.\"  Id. According to Woodward, Sawyer presented this analysis \"largely in stark 'either-or' terms.\"   Def. Br. at 35.  He claims to have premised \"the core\" of his defense on this \"bright line\" distinction, attempting to persuade the jury that Woodward and Sawyer's relationship should be found \"to fall on the 'friendship' side of the line,\" because of the family friendship and the social nature of the functions at which the expenditures were made.  Id. at 38.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward's theory of the case is flawed, based on a misreading of our decision in Sawyer.   Relationships among human beings, especially among lobbyists and elected officials, will frequently not follow a bright-line pattern, falling on one side or the other of some magical wall dividing friendship from attempts at undue influence.  A lobbyist and legislator may initially have an exclusively business relationship when they first meet, but if it continues over time, given the nature of the lobbying business with its sometimes \"lavish hospitality,\" Sawyer, 85 F.3d at 741, the individuals involved may eventually get to know each other, and some may be able to claim, with some truth, that their relationship has become one of friendship.  We did not imply anything different in Sawyer,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> and we certainly did not state or imply what Woodward's theory seems to entail:  that the formation of a friendship between a lobbyist and a legislator somehow insulates both from prosecution for honest services fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A look at Sawyer's language illustrates Woodward's error.  We stated:  \"[I]f the aim of the lobbyist were simply to cultivate a business or political 'friendship' with the legislator,\" then payments for entertainment would not constitute a violation of the Travel Act or the mail or wire fraud statutes.  85 F.3d at 741 (emphasis added).  To so hold--that conduct is not illegal if it is \"simply\" to cultivate a friendship--does not immunize dual intent conduct.  The word \"simply\" carries the import of \"solely.\"   A dual intent that seeks both to cultivate friendship and to illegally influence official acts is not a purpose that is \"simply\" to promote friendship.  Such a dual purpose is not insulated from criminal liability merely because, in Sawyer, we were careful to protect a purpose that is \"simply\" to promote friendship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, in Sawyer we said:  \"[I]f Sawyer had this limited intent--to cultivate friendship rather than to influence an official act--the federal statutes here involved would not be violated.\"  Id. (emphasis added).  An intent \"limited\" to promoting friendship does not include an intent that also has a second purpose.  The words \"rather than\"--when juxtaposed in this way against the \"limited intent\" language--imply that an intent to influence cannot be part of one's intent if one seeks the Sawyer immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After discussing an intent limited to the cultivation of business or friendship, Sawyer went on to say that:  \"Only if instead or in addition, there is an intent to cause the recipient to alter her official acts may the jury find a theft of honest services or the bribery predicate of the Travel Act.\"  Id. at 741 (emphasis added).  Woodward's argument addresses the \"instead\" portion of the disjunctive, but Woodward offers no basis for reading the highlighted words out of our holding in Sawyer.   The quoted sentence clearly contemplates, not a \"bright line\" or \"either-or\" dichotomy (Def.  Br. at 37-38), but the possibility that a defendant may be prosecuted if he possesses a dual intent, an illegal intent \"in addition\" to a legal \"friendship\" intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, Sawyer's language does not mean what Woodward would like it to mean--that conduct must have an exclusively illegal intent in order to be subject to the criminal laws.  Rather, it means only that conduct may not be subject to the criminal laws if the intent underlying it is exclusively legal.   A defendant may be prosecuted for deprivation of honest services if he has a dual intent, i.e., if he is found to have intended both a lawful and an unlawful purpose to some degree.  If the jury finds that an unlawful purpose was present, it may convict the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Third Circuit reached a similar conclusion in United States v.

As Woodward noted, the jury in Greber \"was instructed similarly to the present case, making any amount of inducement, however small, illegal.\"   Def. Br. at 39 n. 27;  see Greber, 760 F.2d at 72.

Br. at 38, is that, for all relevant purposes, it did.  The district court instructed the jury, inter alia, as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p>You may not find that the defendant violated either set of federal laws which I have described to you if his receipt of the expenditures was solely part of a routine cultivation of a business or political friendship rather than an intent on his part to be influenced in his official legislative duties.  If instead or in addition, there is an intent on the defendant's part to be influenced in his official legislative duties, then you may find a violation of either set of federal laws.  If there is both the intent to cultivate a business and political relationship and the intent to be influenced in official legislative duties, then you may find a violation of the federal laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward would have us go beyond Sawyer in the present case.  He insists that the real issue here is the degree of unlawful intent necessary<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> in a dual intent case to permit or sustain a conviction, and the necessary jury charge on that point.  Woodward argues that the protective instruction we set forth in Sawyer should be modified to say that an illegal purpose must be at least \"one of the [scheme's] several dominant purposes,\" Def.  Br. at 40 (quoting United States v. Ellis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"562610\"><a href=\"/opinion/562610/united-states-v-edward-b-ellis-aka-rocco-ellis/\"><span class=\"volume\">935</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1991) (Mann Act)) (emphasis added).  Otherwise, under our reading of Sawyer, a de minimus illegal intent could result in a conviction even if it were dwarfed by a perfectly legal \"friendship\" intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Woodward, the illegal purpose of the gratuity should not be a minor or incidental portion of the mix.  We disagree.  The criminal law may punish conduct even if its illegal purpose is incidental to other, legal purposes.  See Anderson, 417 U.S. at 226, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109053\"><a href=\"/opinion/109053/anderson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

But this does not mean that the district court erred in failing to give an instruction as to the \"de minimus \" point.  The law may require a certain degree of illegal intent in order to convict, but it does not follow that an explicit instruction on that point is necessary.  In the present case, even if the instructions were not technically adequate because they lacked an explicit \"de minimus \" instruction, Woodward was not prejudiced thereby.  \"An error in jury instructions will warrant reversal of a judgment only if the error is determined to have been prejudicial, based on a review of the record as a whole.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  Davet v.

As we have already discussed in Part III, there is no evidentiary basis in this record for Woodward's implicit contention that he had no more than a de minimus degree of intent to defraud the public of his honest services.  Therefore the omission of explicit \"de minimus \" language from the jury instructions--even if erroneous--did not prejudice Woodward, and any error does not warrant reversal of his conviction.  See Davet, 973 F.2d at 26.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V</p>\n    <p>Super Bowl Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward appeals the denial of his motion in limine to exclude evidence that Hancock, through Sawyer, paid for a 1986 trip for Woodward and his wife to the Super Bowl in New Orleans.  The court permitted the government to introduce evidence concerning the Woodwards' receipt of $1,809 worth of airfare, lodging, and tickets to the game.  After admitting such evidence, the court gave a limiting instruction to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Woodward objects that this particular gratuity involved more money and was different in kind than the gratuities on the basis of which he was convicted:  it included payment for airfare and lodging, whereas all other gratuities were limited to meals, golf, and other forms of entertainment.  He also points out that the statute of limitations precludes Woodward from being charged with crimes committed prior to July 27, 1990, and that 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1346 was not even enacted until November 18, 1988.  For these reasons, Woodward claims that the admission of the Super Bowl evidence was of limited probative value, and that whatever probative value it did have was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.  He argues that it should have been excluded under Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Rule 403, \"if the evidence brings unwanted baggage, say, unfair prejudice or a cognizable risk of confusing the jury, and if the baggage's weight substantially overbalances any probative value, then the evidence must be excluded.\"  United States v.

The government argues, with some force, that the Super Bowl gratuity, elaborate as it was, established and set the tone for the ongoing relationship, i.e., a conspiracy to trade valuable gifts for influence, to deprive Woodward's constituents of his honest services.  Once the nature of the relationship was established, ongoing gifts could be given in smaller amounts in order to \"keep the wheels greased.\"   Thus, the Super Bowl evidence has a good deal more probative value than Woodward suggests.  And its prejudicial effect is far less:  accepting tickets to the Super Bowl is not so heinous or outrageous that the jury was likely to be inflamed against Woodward and ignore the arguments presented in his defense,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> thereby risking a conviction based on passion rather than on the evidence.

The numerical evidence in the chart came from Sawyer's expense accounts submitted to Hancock for reimbursement.  For years other than 1989, if Woodward participated in a particular event, then Sawyer's expenditure on that event was divided among the number of participants in order to calculate, as closely as possible, the share received by Woodward.  In 1989, for a conference on Amelia Island, Sawyer's records do not reflect which legislators participated in which events.  Therefore it was not clear what share each individual legislator received of the $5,282 of Sawyer's total expenses for the conference.

Under the territorial effects doctrine, jurisdiction exists only when significant effects were intended within the prescribing territory.  Laker Airways Ltd. v.

This jurisdictional concept of international law has been applied to jurisdiction by one state over criminal activities of out-of-state entities which affect the forum state.  See Beneficial Fin.

Given the evidence of repeated expenditures, \"a jury could rationally find that [the defendant and his co-conspirators] agreed, at least tacitly, to the pattern of unlawful conduct.

It stated:  \"Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof that leaves you firmly convinced of the defendant's guilt.  There are very few things, of course, in this world that we know with absolute certainty.  And in criminal cases, the law does not require proof that overcomes every possible doubt.  If, based on your consideration of the evidence, you are firmly convinced that the defendant is guilty of the crime charged, you must find him guilty.  If on the other hand, you think there is a real possibility that he is not guilty, you must give him the benefit of the doubt and find him not guilty.\"</p>\n        <p>Woodward has not appealed this portion of the jury instructions, so plain error review is appropriate.
