George Z. Singal, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                      Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n              Campbell and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Anne Hiltner on brief pro se.\n     Peter Herbert, Milissa Mather, Lankler, Siffert & Wohl, Warren\nM. Silver, Karen D. Kemble and The Silver Law Firm on brief for\nappellees Simon & Schuster, Inc., and Stephen R. King.\n     Robert H. Stier, Jr., and Pierce Atwood on brief for appellee\nGlassbook, Inc.\n\n\n\n                           April 5, 2002\n\f            Per Curiam.        Appellant Anne Hiltner sued Stephen\n\nKing, Simon & Schuster, and Glassbook, Inc., alleging that\n\nRiding the Bullet, a novella written by Stephen King and\n\npublished on the Internet, was copied from an unpublished\n\nmanuscript entitled Robert Adams. This manuscript was authored\n\nby appellant's late brother, and appellant apparently has an\n\nownership interest in the copyright for this work.                   Appellant\n\nalso asserts that certain events described in Riding the Bullet\n\nare based directly on the actual hospitalization and emergency\n\nsurgery    of    appellant's   mother.         Based    on   the   foregoing,\nappellant       claimed   copyright    infringement      and   invasion    of\n\nprivacy.        These claims fail, as a matter of law, for the\nfollowing reasons.\n            1.      Copyright Infringement.            It is plain from a\n\nreview of both works that they are not \"substantially similar.\"\nSee 4 Melville B. Nimmer & David Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright §\n\n13.01[B], at 13-8 to 13-9 (2001) (to state an actionable\n\ncopyright claim, a plaintiff must show that \"the defendant's\nwork is substantially similar to [the] work [in question] such\nthat liability may attach\").                In particular, neither the\n\nsequence of events nor the development of the characters in\nRobert Adams have been replicated in Riding the Bullet.                   See\n\nid.   §   13.03[A][1][b],      at     13-32.      Further,     and    despite\n\nappellant's allegations to the contrary, she has failed to\nidentify any matter in Riding the Bullet which was quoted\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fdirectly from Robert Adams.            See id. § 13.03[A][2], at 13-45.\n\nAppellant therefore has no copyright claim.\n\n            2.   Invasion of Privacy.               A tort action for the\nfollowing four kinds of conduct may be brought as a claim for\n\ninvasion of privacy:             (1) \"unreasonable intrusion upon the\n\nseclusion of another\"; (2) \"appropriation of the other's name\nor likeness\"; (3) \"unreasonable publicity given to the other's\n\nprivate life\"; and (4) \"publicity that unreasonably places the\n\nother in a false light before the public.\"                  See Nelson v. Maine\n\nTimes, 373 A.2d 1221, 1223 (Me. 1977) (quoting the Restatement\n\n(Second) of Torts § 652A (1977); internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).    However, \"[e]xcept for the appropriation of one's\n\nname or likeness, an action for invasion of privacy can be\nmaintained   only    by      a    living    individual       whose   privacy    is\n\ninvaded.\"    Id. at 1225 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts\n\n§ 652I; internal quotation marks omitted and emphasis added).\nAppellant has failed to demonstrate a claim for any of the\n\nabove.\n            First,     her       allegation    that    she    has    been    under\n\nsurveillance for years is completely conclusory and is not\n\nsupported by specific facts.               Second, because neither she nor\n\nher mother possibly could be identified from anything in Riding\n\nthe   Bullet,    the      defendants         have     not    engaged    in     any\n\nmisappropriation of name or likeness.                       Finally, there is\n\nabsolutely no evidence that anything in Riding the Bullet\n\nconcerns appellant's private life nor places appellant in a\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\ffalse light. That is, appellant has not shown that anything in\n\nthe novella pertains to her.\n\n          Affirmed. Appellant's motion to hold this appeal in\nabeyance until the University of Maine and the Maine Division\n\nof Mental Health file briefs is denied as moot.\n\n\n\n\n                               -4-\n\f",
