Ernesto Jose Encarnacion appeals\n\na district court order denying his motion under Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n5(a) to dismiss his indictment for the government's alleged\n\nfailure   to    bring   him     before   a   magistrate   judge    \"without\n\nunnecessary delay.\"         He also appeals his sentence, claiming that\n\nthe district court should have departed from the Sentencing\n\nGuidelines based on the facts of his case.            We affirm.\n\n                                I. Background\n\n            On January 24, 1999, Encarnacion, a citizen of the\n\nDominican Republic and a convicted felon previously removed from\n\nthe United States for narcotics-related offenses, attempted to\n\nreenter the country through the Luis Munoz Marin International\n\nAirport in San Juan, Puerto Rico.            Upon his arrival, a computer\n\ncheck of his passport by officials of the U.S. Immigration and\n\nNaturalization Service (\"INS\") revealed that Encarnacion may\n\nhave been previously removed for a crime of moral turpitude, and\n\nhe was detained in an INS facility.             The next day, during an\n\ninterview      with   INS    Senior   Inspector    Fernando   Ruz-Bulerin\n\n(\"Ruz\"), Encarnacion admitted his previous deportation.1             At the\n\nend of the interview, Ruz, apparently unaware of the specifics\n\nof Encarnacion's criminal history, told Encarnacion that the\n\n\n    1Before the start of the conversation, Ruz told Encarnacion\nthat the interview was related to Encarnacion's application to\nenter the United States.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fprior order of removal would be reinstated and that Encarnacion\n\nwould likely be deported.              Encarnacion was detained for seven\n\nadditional     days   prior       to   being     brought     before    a   federal\n\nmagistrate judge, a period the government claims it used in\n\norder to obtain documents, such as the immigration judge's\n\ndeportation order, needed to resolve definitively Encarnacion's\n\napplication to enter the country.                     As it turned out, upon\n\nreceiving     and   reviewing       the    INS   file,    Ruz   determined     that\n\ncriminal charges, rather than deportation, were warranted in\n\nEncarnacion's case, as Encarnacion had previously been convicted\n\nof an aggravated felony and had been deported on that basis.\n\nSee 8 U.S.C. ยง 1326(b)(2) (prohibiting attempted reentry into\n\nthe United States by an individual previously deported for an\n\naggravated     felony      without        advance     authorization     from    the\n\nAttorney General).\n\n            After being indicted, Encarnacion moved to have the\n\ncharges dismissed on the ground that the eight-day period of\n\ndetention     prior   to    the     probable-cause         hearing    constituted\n\n\"unnecessary delay\" under Fed. R. Crim. P. 5(a).                     The district\n\ncourt,   in    a    written    memorandum           and   opinion,    found    that\n\nEncarnacion's detention by the INS was civil in nature, and that\n\nRule   5(a)    therefore      was      inapplicable.         United    States    v.\n\nEncarnacion, 56 F. Supp. 2d 151, 159 (D.P.R. 1999).\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\f          Following the district court's decision, Encarnacion\n\nand   the government entered into negotiations that eventually\n\nculminated in a plea agreement.             In it, the parties agreed on\n\nthe appropriate fine and terms of imprisonment and supervised\n\nrelease, and the government pledged to recommend a sentence at\n\nthe low end of the guideline range.                  The agreement, however,\n\nalso stated (and Encarnacion was duly informed at the change-of-\n\nplea hearing) that, pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(e)(1)(B),\n\nthe district court ultimately would impose the sentence in\n\naccordance with the guidelines, and that the exact terms of the\n\nsentence would be left to the sound discretion of the district\n\ncourt.   At the sentencing hearing, both Encarnacion and the\n\ngovernment    requested    that     the    presentence       report's       (\"PSR\")\n\nCategory III criminal-history finding be reduced to Category II.\n\nEncarnacion    further     argued    that    his      was    an    atypical    case\n\nwarranting departure from the guidelines, notwithstanding the\n\nPSR's conclusion to the contrary.           Noting Encarnacion's multiple\n\ndrug offenses before his prior removal, the district court\n\nrejected these requests and sentenced Encarnacion to 46 months'\n\nimprisonment, a term at the low end of the guideline range\n\nproduced by the application of a Category III criminal history.\n\nEncarnacion   also   was    sentenced       to   a    term    of    three    years'\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fsupervised release, and was ordered to pay a special monetary\n\nassessment of $100.\n\n            On appeal, Encarnacion challenges the district court's\n\ndenial of his motion to dismiss the indictment, as well as his\n\nsentence.\n\n                 II. Rule 5(a) \"Unnecessary Delay\"\n\n            Encarnacion first asserts that the eight-day detention\n\nprior to his appearance before a federal magistrate judge was an\n\n\"unnecessary delay\" within the meaning of Fed. R. Crim. P. 5(a),\n\nthereby necessitating dismissal of the charges against him.        We\n\nreview de novo the district court's construction of the Federal\n\nRules of Criminal Procedure.    United States v. Randazzo, 80 F.3d\n\n623, 627 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n            Rule 5(a), in relevant part, states:\n\n            Except as otherwise provided in this rule,\n            an officer making an arrest under a warrant\n            issued upon a complaint or any person making\n            an arrest without a warrant shall take the\n            arrested person without unnecessary delay\n            before   the   nearest   available   federal\n            magistrate judge or, if a federal magistrate\n            judge is not reasonably available, before a\n            state or local judicial officer authorized\n            by 18 U.S.C. ยง 3041.\n\nAttempting to apply this rule to his situation, Encarnacion\n\nargues that, from the moment he admitted his prior deportation\n\nfor an aggravated felony to INS officials, his detention became\n\n\"criminal\"    because   his   admission   put   the   government   on\n\n                                 -6-\n\fheightened notice that his attempt to reenter the country was\n\nunlawful.       Accordingly, he claims that his right to a prompt\n\nhearing before a magistrate judge was triggered at the moment of\n\nhis confession, and that he was denied this right by being\n\ndetained    seven     additional    days      prior     to   the   probable-cause\n\nhearing.        In Encarnacion's view, his eight-day detention was\n\nthe government's method of holding him for the sole purpose of\n\ndeveloping criminal charges against him -- a practice that he\n\nclaims the government was precluded from utilizing under Rule\n\n5(a).\n\n            In response, the government contends that Rule 5(a) has\n\nlittle bearing on Encarnacion since, prior to his appearance\n\nbefore    the   magistrate   judge,      his     case    could     not   be   fairly\n\ndescribed       as    \"criminal.\"          The    government        argues      that\n\nEncarnacion's arrest and detention were executed according to\n\nthe civil detention provisions of the immigration laws.                       See 8\n\nU.S.C. ยง 1357(a)(2).         The upshot of this, according to the\n\ngovernment, is that the rights afforded by the Federal Rules of\n\nCriminal Procedure attached only after the U.S. Attorney acted\n\non Encarnacion's case.           The government further argues that, in\n\nthis case, the eight-day detention prior to the probable-cause\n\nhearing     was      necessary     to    secure       adequate      evidence      of\n\nEncarnacion's prior deportation, as Encarnacion's confession\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fstanding alone would not suffice to prove the occurrence of\n\nthose   prior   events    to   the       magistrate   judge.    Finally,   the\n\ngovernment argues that Rule 5(a) was followed to the extent\n\nrequired, in that the U.S. Attorney filed the criminal complaint\n\non the same day that Ruz received Encarnacion's INS file and\n\nthat Encarnacion received a probable-cause hearing within 48\n\nhours of the filing of the complaint.2\n\n           Under   8     U.S.C.      ยง    1357(a)(2),   INS    officials   are\n\nempowered to perform the warrantless arrest of \"any alien who in\n\n[their] presence or view is entering or attempting to enter the\n\nUnited States in violation of any law or regulation made in\n\npursuance of law regulating the admission, exclusion, expulsion,\n\nor removal of aliens . . . .\"              The statute also requires that\n\nthe detained alien \"shall be taken without unnecessary delay for\n\nexamination before an officer of the [INS] having authority to\n\n\n    2Following the district court's analysis, Encarnacion\nargues, and the government seems to agree, that Rule 5(a)\nincorporates the Fourth Amendment's requirement of prompt\ndetermination of probable cause. See Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S.\n103, 126 (1975) (holding that the Fourth Amendment requires\n\"prompt\" judicial determination of probable cause following a\nwarrantless arrest); County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S.\n44, 56-57 (1991) (determining that promptness in this context\ngenerally requires that the suspect be brought before the\nmagistrate judge within 48 hours of the warrantless arrest).\nWhile the Rule 5(a) and Fourth Amendment contexts are certainly\n\"analogous,\" Anderson v. Calderon, 232 F.3d 1053, 1104 (9th Cir.\n2000) (McKeown, J., dissenting), the 48-hour rule is a\nrequirement of the Fourth Amendment, not Rule 5(a). McLaughlin,\n500 U.S. at 56.\n\n                                         -8-\n\fexamine aliens as to their right to enter or remain in the\n\nUnited States.\"      Id.    Although ยง 1357(a)(2) does not, by its\n\nterms,   reveal    its   \"civil\"     or    \"criminal\"   character,      it    is\n\naccompanied by a provision authorizing the INS \"to make arrests\n\nfor felonies which have been committed and which are cognizable\n\nunder any law of the United States regulating the admission,\n\nexclusion, expulsion, or removal of aliens . . . .\"                       Id. ยง\n\n1357(a)(4)   (emphasis     added).        Section   1357(a)(4),      unlike    ยง\n\n1357(a)(2), does not require that the alien be taken before an\n\nINS officer, but rather before \"the nearest available officer\n\nempowered to commit persons charged with offenses against the\n\nlaws of the United States . . . .\"\n\n           In giving distinct meaning to both provisions, courts\n\nhave read ยง 1357(a)(2) to apply to arrests of aliens for \"status\n\noffenses,\" or immigration-related offenses (such as illegal\n\nentry into the United States) that only apply to aliens, while\n\ninterpreting ยง 1357(a)(4) to apply to arrests of aliens for\n\n\"nonstatus   offenses,\"     i.e.,    crimes    (such    as   assault)     whose\n\nelements   could   be    satisfied    by    any   person,    alien   or    not.\n\nEncarnacion, 56 F. Supp. 2d at 154; cf. United States v. Sotoj-\n\nLopez, 603 F.2d 789, 791 (9th Cir. 1979) (per curiam) (finding\n\nthat ยง 1357(a)(2) does not encompass arrests and detentions for\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fnonstatus    offenses).3      This     distinction     is     crucial    to     the\n\ngovernment's argument, as courts have held, in turn, that Rule\n\n5(a) generally does not protect ยง 1357(a)(2) civil detainees.\n\nUnited States v. Noel, 231 F.3d 833, 837 (11th Cir. 2000) (per\n\ncuriam), petition for cert. filed, 69 U.S.L.W. ___ (U.S. Jan.\n\n23, 2001) (No. 00-8139); United States v. Cepeda-Luna, 989 F.2d\n\n353, 358 (9th Cir. 1993); United States v. Valente, 155 F. Supp.\n\n577, 579 (D. Mass. 1957) (Aldrich, J.).\n\n            We believe that an offense under 8 U.S.C. ยง 1326(b)(2)\n\nqualifies as a \"status offense.\"              By definition, the act of\n\nattempting to reenter the United States as a removed alien\n\nwithout   the   express     consent    of    the   Attorney    General     is    an\n\nimmigration-related       offense     that    only   aliens    can   commit.\n\nMoreover, and more to the point, the INS's primary purpose in\n\ninvestigating Encarnacion was, from the beginning, civil.                     Even\n\nthough    the   documents    contained       in    Encarnacion's     INS      file\n\nultimately served as the catalyst for the filing of felony\n\ncharges, the reason that the INS retrieved the file in the first\n\nplace was to act on what they thought was a simple reinstatement\n\n\n    3Encarnacion cites Sotoj-Lopez in support of the proposition\nthat Rule 5(a) should apply to his arrest and detention.      In\nthat case, however, the Ninth Circuit found that \"section\n1357(a)(2) relaxed Rule 5(a) . . . for the examination of an\nalien's right to remain in the United States\" and that the INS\nneed comply with Rule 5(a) only \"if the alien is being charged\nwith a non-status offense.\" 603 F.2d at 791.\n\n                                      -10-\n\fof the prior removal order -- a civil matter.      Upon receipt of\n\nEncarnacion's file, however, Ruz learned for the first time of\n\nEncarnacion's prior aggravated felonies, a discovery that caused\n\nhim to change the treatment of the case from a deportation\n\nmatter to a referral of possible criminal activity to the U.S.\n\nAttorney.    It is in this context that Encarnacion was arrested\n\nand subsequently detained under the civil authority of 8 U.S.C.\n\nยง 1357(a)(2).\n\n            Furthermore, we do not believe that Encarnacion's civil\n\ndetention was a pretext for holding him in order to develop\n\nother criminal charges, nor do we find that his admission of\n\nillegal entry to INS officials transformed his case from a civil\n\ncase to a criminal one.     From the moment he was stopped at the\n\nSan Juan airport, the INS was required by law to determine\n\nwhether     Encarnacion's application to enter the country was\n\nvalid, and to this end, it immediately put into motion the\n\nadministrative process of determining Encarnacion's status. His\n\ninterview with Ruz, mandated by the \"taken without unnecessary\n\ndelay . . . before an officer of the [INS]\" language of ยง\n\n1357(a)(2), amplified the INS's suspicions that Encarnacion's\n\nattempted entry was unlawful.    But only after receiving the INS\n\nfile on Encarnacion containing the prior deportation order had\n\nRuz secured the \"probable cause\" necessary to initiate the\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fcriminal process under the applicable law and regulations.                       See\n\nMountain High Knitting, Inc. v. Reno, 51 F.3d 216, 218 (9th Cir.\n\n1995) (\"[A]lthough the lack of documentation or other admission\n\nof illegal presence may be some indication of illegal entry, it\n\ndoes not, without more, provide probable cause of the criminal\n\nviolation of illegal entry.\") (emphasis added) (quoting Gonzales\n\nv. City of Peoria, 722 F.2d 468, 476-77 (9th Cir. 1983)); 8\n\nC.F.R. ยง 241.8(a)(1) (requiring INS officers to obtain prior\n\norder of deportation in determining whether reinstatement-of-\n\nremoval order is appropriate). Consequently, Encarnacion's case\n\ndid   not   become    criminal     until    Ruz's      contact    with    the   U.S.\n\nAttorney,    and     after     that      point,      Encarnacion    was    brought\n\nexpeditiously before the federal magistrate judge.\n\n            Certainly,       in   most     cases,      prompt    action    by   INS\n\nofficials    (and     the    availability       of    today's    parcel-delivery\n\nservices) should make it possible to transmit files between INS\n\noffices     more     quickly      than    seven      days.       Here,    however,\n\nEncarnacion has presented no evidence (nor do we find any in the\n\nrecord) indicating that his detention was a dilatory tactic\n\nemployed by the government for some impermissible purpose.4\n\n\n      4\n     Like the district court, we acknowledge that the difference\nbetween civil and criminal detentions may appear formalistic,\nand that in practical terms an unnecessarily long detention\nunder civil law is no better for the detainee than one under the\ncriminal law.     We have held that aliens in Encarnacion's\n\n                                         -12-\n\f             Having       determined      that    Encarnacion's    arrest       and\n\ndetention were civil and nonpretextual, we have little trouble\n\nholding that Rule 5(a) did not render his eight-day detention\n\nunlawful.       We    agree   with     the   Eleventh    and   Ninth    Circuits'\n\nrespective holdings in Noel, 231 F.3d at 837, and Cepeda-Luna,\n\n989   F.2d    at   358,    that    Rule    5(a)   is   inapplicable     to   civil\n\ndeportation arrests and detentions under 8 U.S.C. ยง 1357(a)(2).\n\nAccordingly,         we   affirm     the     district    court's       denial    of\n\nEncarnacion's motion to dismiss the indictment.5\n\n             III. Application of the Sentencing Guidelines\n\n             Encarnacion's other argument is that the district court\n\nerred in rejecting the joint request under the plea agreement to\n\n\n\nsituation who are unlawfully detained may petition for habeas\ncorpus relief under 28 U.S.C. ยง 2241, even after the passage of\nthe Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act,\nPub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996). Mahadeo v. Reno,\n226 F.3d 3, 10 (1st Cir. 2000), petition for cert. filed, 69\nU.S.L.W. 3418 (U.S. Dec. 11, 2000) (No. 00-962).\n      5\n     Several courts have held that in cases where an unnecessary\ndelay before the probable-cause hearing is not used to subject\ndefendant to unwarranted interrogation, Rule 5(a) does not\nprovide a basis for dismissal of the indictment because\ndefendant cannot be said to have been prejudiced by the delay.\nUnited States v.

R. Crim. P. 5(a) to dismiss his indictment for the government's alleged failure to bring him before a magistrate judge \"without unnecessary delay.\" He also appeals his sentence, claiming that the district court should have departed from the Sentencing Guidelines based on the facts of his case. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 24, 1999, Encarnacion, a citizen of the Dominican Republic and a convicted felon previously removed from the United States for narcotics-related offenses, attempted to reenter the country through the Luis Munoz Marin International Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Upon his arrival, a computer check of his passport by officials of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") revealed that Encarnacion may have been previously removed for a crime of moral turpitude, and he was detained in an INS facility. The next day, during an interview with INS Senior Inspector Fernando Ruz-Bulerin (\"Ruz\"), Encarnacion admitted his previous deportation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> At the end of the interview, Ruz, apparently unaware of the specifics of Encarnacion's criminal history, told Encarnacion that the prior order of removal would be reinstated and that Encarnacion would likely be deported. Encarnacion was detained for seven additional days prior to being brought before a federal magistrate judge, a period the government claims it used in order to obtain documents, such as the immigration judge's deportation order, needed to resolve definitively Encarnacion's application to enter the country. As it turned out, upon receiving and reviewing the INS file, Ruz determined that criminal charges, rather than deportation, were warranted in Encarnacion's case, as Encarnacion had previously been convicted of an aggravated felony and had been deported on that basis. See 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(b)(2) (prohibiting attempted reentry into the United States by an individual previously deported for an aggravated felony without advance authorization from the Attorney General).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After being indicted, Encarnacion moved to have the charges dismissed on the ground that the eight-day period of detention prior to the probable-cause hearing constituted \"unnecessary delay\" under Fed. R. Crim. P. 5(a). The district court, in a written memorandum and opinion, found that Encarnacion's detention by the INS was civil in nature, and that Rule 5(a) therefore was inapplicable. United States v. Encarnacion, 56 F. Supp. 2d 151, 159 (D.P.R. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the district court's decision, Encarnacion and the government entered into negotiations that eventually culminated in a plea agreement. In it, the parties agreed on the appropriate fine and terms of imprisonment and supervised release, and the government pledged to recommend a sentence at the low end of the guideline range. The agreement, however, also stated (and Encarnacion was duly informed at the change-of-plea hearing) that, pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(e)(1)(B), the district court ultimately would impose the sentence in accordance with the guidelines, and that the exact terms of the sentence would be left to the sound discretion of the district court. At the sentencing hearing, both Encarnacion and the government requested that the presentence report's (\"PSR\") Category III criminal-history finding be reduced to Category II. Encarnacion further argued that his was an atypical case warranting departure from the guidelines, notwithstanding the PSR's conclusion to the contrary. Noting Encarnacion's multiple drug offenses before his prior removal, the district court rejected these requests and sentenced Encarnacion to 46 months' imprisonment, a term at the low end of the guideline range produced by the application of a Category III criminal history. Encarnacion also was sentenced to a term of three years' supervised release, and was ordered to pay a special monetary assessment of $100.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Encarnacion challenges the district court's denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment, as well as his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">II. Rule 5(a) \"Unnecessary Delay\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Encarnacion first asserts that the eight-day detention prior to his appearance before a federal magistrate judge was an \"unnecessary delay\" within the meaning of Fed. R. Crim. P. 5(a), thereby necessitating dismissal of the charges against him. We review de novo the district court's construction of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. United States v. Randazzo, 80 F.3d 623, 627 (1st Cir. 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 5(a), in relevant part, states: Except as otherwise provided in this rule, an officer making an arrest under a warrant issued upon a complaint or any person making an arrest without a warrant shall take the arrested person without unnecessary delay before the nearest available federal magistrate judge or, if a federal magistrate judge is not reasonably available, before a state or local judicial officer authorized by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3041.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Attempting to apply this rule to his situation, Encarnacion argues that, from the moment he admitted his prior deportation for an aggravated felony to INS officials, his detention became \"criminal\" because his admission put the government on heightened notice that his attempt to reenter the country was unlawful. Accordingly, he claims that his right to a prompt hearing before a magistrate judge was triggered at the moment of his confession, and that he was denied this right by being detained seven additional days prior to the probable-cause hearing. In Encarnacion's view, his eight-day detention was the government's method of holding him for the sole purpose of developing criminal charges against him -- a practice that he claims the government was precluded from utilizing under Rule 5(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, the government contends that Rule 5(a) has little bearing on Encarnacion since, prior to his appearance before the magistrate judge, his case could not be fairly described as \"criminal.\" The government argues that Encarnacion's arrest and detention were executed according to the civil detention provisions of the immigration laws. See 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1357(a)(2). The upshot of this, according to the government, is that the rights afforded by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure attached only after the U.S. Attorney acted on Encarnacion's case. The government further argues that, in this case, the eight-day detention prior to the probable-cause hearing was necessary to secure adequate evidence of Encarnacion's prior deportation, as Encarnacion's confession standing alone would not suffice to prove the occurrence of those prior events to the magistrate judge. Finally, the government argues that Rule 5(a) was followed to the extent required, in that the U.S. Attorney filed the criminal complaint on the same day that Ruz received Encarnacion's INS file and that Encarnacion received a probable-cause hearing within 48 hours of the filing of the complaint.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1357(a)(2), INS officials are empowered to perform the warrantless arrest of \"any alien who in [their] presence or view is entering or attempting to enter the United States in violation of any law or regulation made in pursuance of law regulating the admission, exclusion, expulsion, or removal of aliens . . . .\" The statute also requires that the detained alien \"shall be taken without unnecessary delay for examination before an officer of the [INS] having authority to examine aliens as to their right to enter or remain in the United States.\" Id. Although &#167; 1357(a)(2) does not, by its terms, reveal its \"civil\" or \"criminal\" character, it is accompanied by a provision authorizing the INS \"to make arrests for felonies which have been committed and which are cognizable under any law of the United States regulating the admission, exclusion, expulsion, or removal of aliens . . . .\" Id. &#167; 1357(a)(4) (emphasis added). Section 1357(a)(4), unlike &#167; 1357(a)(2), does not require that the alien be taken before an INS officer, but rather before \"the nearest available officer empowered to commit persons charged with offenses against the laws of the United States . . . .\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In giving distinct meaning to both provisions, courts have read &#167; 1357(a)(2) to apply to arrests of aliens for \"status offenses,\" or immigration-related offenses (such as illegal entry into the United States) that only apply to aliens, while interpreting &#167; 1357(a)(4) to apply to arrests of aliens for \"nonstatus offenses,\" i.e., crimes (such as assault) whose elements could be satisfied by any person, alien or not. Encarnacion, 56 F. Supp. 2d at 154; cf. United States v. Sotoj-Lopez, 603 F.2d 789, 791 (9th Cir. 1979) (per curiam) (finding that &#167; 1357(a)(2) does not encompass arrests and detentions for nonstatus offenses).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> This distinction is crucial to the government's argument, as courts have held, in turn, that Rule 5(a) generally does not protect &#167; 1357(a)(2) civil detainees. United States v. Noel, 231 F.3d 833, 837 (11th Cir. 2000) (per curiam), petition for cert. filed, 69 U.S.L.W. ___ (U.S. Jan. 23, 2001) (No. 00-8139); United States v. Cepeda-Luna, 989 F.2d 353, 358 (9th Cir. 1993); United States v. Valente, 155 F. Supp. 577, 579 (D. Mass. 1957) (Aldrich, J.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that an offense under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(b)(2) qualifies as a \"status offense.\" By definition, the act of attempting to reenter the United States as a removed alien without the express consent of the Attorney General is an immigration-related offense that only aliens can commit. Moreover, and more to the point, the INS's primary purpose in investigating Encarnacion was, from the beginning, civil. Even though the documents contained in Encarnacion's INS file ultimately served as the catalyst for the filing of felony charges, the reason that the INS retrieved the file in the first place was to act on what they thought was a simple reinstatement of the prior removal order -- a civil matter. Upon receipt of Encarnacion's file, however, Ruz learned for the first time of Encarnacion's prior aggravated felonies, a discovery that caused him to change the treatment of the case from a deportation matter to a referral of possible criminal activity to the U.S. Attorney. It is in this context that Encarnacion was arrested and subsequently detained under the civil authority of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1357(a)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, we do not believe that Encarnacion's civil detention was a pretext for holding him in order to develop other criminal charges, nor do we find that his admission of illegal entry to INS officials transformed his case from a civil case to a criminal one. From the moment he was stopped at the San Juan airport, the INS was required by law to determine whether Encarnacion's application to enter the country was valid, and to this end, it immediately put into motion the administrative process of determining Encarnacion's status. His interview with Ruz, mandated by the \"taken without unnecessary delay . . . before an officer of the [INS]\" language of &#167; 1357(a)(2), amplified the INS's suspicions that Encarnacion's attempted entry was unlawful. But only after receiving the INS file on Encarnacion containing the prior deportation order had Ruz secured the \"probable cause\" necessary to initiate the criminal process under the applicable law and regulations. SeeMountain High Knitting, Inc. v. Reno, 51 F.3d 216, 218 (9th Cir. 1995) (\"[A]lthough the lack of documentation or other admission of illegal presence may be some indication of illegal entry, it does not, without more, provide probable cause of the criminal violation of illegal entry.\") (emphasis added) (quoting Gonzales v. City of Peoria, 722 F.2d 468, 476-77 (9th Cir. 1983)); 8 C.F.R. &#167; 241.8(a)(1) (requiring INS officers to obtain prior order of deportation in determining whether reinstatement-of-removal order is appropriate). Consequently, Encarnacion's case did not become criminal until Ruz's contact with the U.S. Attorney, and after that point, Encarnacion was brought expeditiously before the federal magistrate judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly, in most cases, prompt action by INS officials (and the availability of today's parcel-delivery services) should make it possible to transmit files between INS offices more quickly than seven days. Here, however, Encarnacion has presented no evidence (nor do we find any in the record) indicating that his detention was a dilatory tactic employed by the government for some impermissible purpose.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having determined that Encarnacion's arrest and detention were civil and nonpretextual, we have little trouble holding that Rule 5(a) did not render his eight-day detention unlawful. We agree with the Eleventh and Ninth Circuits' respective holdings in Noel, 231 F.3d at 837, and Cepeda-Luna, 989 F.2d at 358, that Rule 5(a) is inapplicable to civil deportation arrests and detentions under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1357(a)(2). Accordingly, we affirm the district court's denial of Encarnacion's motion to dismiss the indictment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. Application of the Sentencing Guidelines</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Encarnacion's other argument is that the district court erred in rejecting the joint request under the plea agreement to lower his criminal-history category, and in refusing to depart from the guidelines based on the \"atypical\" facts of his case. On this later point, he claims that his attempted reentry into the United States was merely an attempt to be reunited with his wife and children (who reside in this country) and that he possesses a sincere desire to enter drug rehabilitation so that he may take better care of his family. This type of argument, however, is squarely foreclosed by the guidelines themselves. As we have frequently held, a district court's refusal to depart from the guidelines may not be reviewed unless the court misconstrued its legal authority to depart. See, e.g., United States v. Savinon-Acosta, 232 F.3d 265, 268 (1st Cir. 2000). In this case, the district court did not misapprehend its legal authority under the guidelines; its decision not to depart rested solely on its reasonable assessment of the facts of Encarnacion's case. Thus there is no basis to disturb the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Before the start of the conversation, Ruz told Encarnacion that the interview was related to Encarnacion's application to enter the United States.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Following the district court's analysis, Encarnacion argues, and the government seems to agree, that Rule 5(a) incorporates the Fourth Amendment's requirement of prompt determination of probable cause. See Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 126 (1975) (holding that the Fourth Amendment requires \"prompt\" judicial determination of probable cause following a warrantless arrest); County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 56-57 (1991) (determining that promptness in this context generally requires that the suspect be brought before the magistrate judge within 48 hours of the warrantless arrest). While the Rule 5(a) and Fourth Amendment contexts are certainly \"analogous,\" Anderson v. Calderon, 232 F.3d 1053, 1104 (9th Cir. 2000) (McKeown, J., dissenting), the 48-hour rule is a requirement of the Fourth Amendment, not Rule 5(a). McLaughlin, 500 U.S. at 56.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Encarnacion cites Sotoj-Lopez in support of the proposition that Rule 5(a) should apply to his arrest and detention. In that case, however, the Ninth Circuit found that \"section 1357(a)(2) relaxed Rule 5(a) . . . for the examination of an alien's right to remain in the United States\" and that the INS need comply with Rule 5(a) only \"if the alien is being charged with a non-status offense.\" 603 F.2d at 791.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Like the district court, we acknowledge that the difference between civil and criminal detentions may appear formalistic, and that in practical terms an unnecessarily long detention under civil law is no better for the detainee than one under the criminal law. We have held that aliens in Encarnacion's situation who are unlawfully detained may petition for habeas corpus relief under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2241, even after the passage of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996). Mahadeo v. Reno, 226 F.3d 3, 10 (1st Cir. 2000), petition for cert. filed, 69 U.S.L.W. 3418 (U.S. Dec. 11, 2000) (No. 00-962).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Several courts have held that in cases where an unnecessary delay before the probable-cause hearing is not used to subject defendant to unwarranted interrogation, Rule 5(a) does not provide a basis for dismissal of the indictment because defendant cannot be said to have been prejudiced by the delay. United States v. Morrison, 153 F.3d 34, 56 (2d Cir. 1998); United States v. Nazarenus, 983 F.2d 1480, 1482-83 (8th Cir. 1993); Lovelace v. United States, 357 F.2d 306, 310 (5th Cir. 1966). In light of our determination that Rule 5(a) does not apply to Encarnacion's civil detention, we need not decide whether Rule 5(a) can ever be a basis for dismissal of an indictment absent evidence of unwarranted interrogation during the period of detention.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

In it, the parties agreed on the appropriate fine and terms of imprisonment and supervised release, and the government pledged to recommend a sentence at the low end of the guideline range. The agreement, however, also stated (and Encarnacion was duly informed at the change-of-plea hearing) that, pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(e)(1)(B), the district court ultimately would impose the sentence in accordance with the guidelines, and that the exact terms of the sentence would be left to the sound discretion of the district court. At the sentencing hearing, both Encarnacion and the government requested that the presentence report's (\"PSR\") Category III criminal-history finding be reduced to Category II. Encarnacion further argued that his was an atypical case warranting departure from the guidelines, notwithstanding the PSR's conclusion to the contrary. Noting Encarnacion's multiple drug offenses before his prior removal, the district court rejected these requests and sentenced Encarnacion to 46 months' imprisonment, a term at the low end of the guideline range produced by the application of a Category III criminal history. Encarnacion also was sentenced to a term of three years' supervised release, and was ordered to pay a special monetary assessment of $100.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Encarnacion challenges the district court's denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment, as well as his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">II.

R. Crim. P. 5(a), thereby necessitating dismissal of the charges against him. We review de novo the district court's construction of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. United States v. Randazzo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196688\"><a href=\"/opinion/196688/united-states-v-randazzo/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">623</span></a></span>, 627 (1st Cir. 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 5(a), in relevant part, states: Except as otherwise provided in this rule, an officer making an arrest under a warrant issued upon a complaint or any person making an arrest without a warrant shall take the arrested person without unnecessary delay before the nearest available federal magistrate judge or, if a federal magistrate judge is not reasonably available, before a state or local judicial officer authorized by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3041.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Attempting to apply this rule to his situation, Encarnacion argues that, from the moment he admitted his prior deportation for an aggravated felony to INS officials, his detention became \"criminal\" because his admission put the government on heightened notice that his attempt to reenter the country was unlawful. Accordingly, he claims that his right to a prompt hearing before a magistrate judge was triggered at the moment of his confession, and that he was denied this right by being detained seven additional days prior to the probable-cause hearing. In Encarnacion's view, his eight-day detention was the government's method of holding him for the sole purpose of developing criminal charges against him -- a practice that he claims the government was precluded from utilizing under Rule 5(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, the government contends that Rule 5(a) has little bearing on Encarnacion since, prior to his appearance before the magistrate judge, his case could not be fairly described as \"criminal.\" The government argues that Encarnacion's arrest and detention were executed according to the civil detention provisions of the immigration laws. See 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1357(a)(2). The upshot of this, according to the government, is that the rights afforded by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure attached only after the U.S. Attorney acted on Encarnacion's case. The government further argues that, in this case, the eight-day detention prior to the probable-cause hearing was necessary to secure adequate evidence of Encarnacion's prior deportation, as Encarnacion's confession standing alone would not suffice to prove the occurrence of those prior events to the magistrate judge. Finally, the government argues that Rule 5(a) was followed to the extent required, in that the U.S. Attorney filed the criminal complaint on the same day that Ruz received Encarnacion's INS file and that Encarnacion received a probable-cause hearing within 48 hours of the filing of the complaint.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1357(a)(2), INS officials are empowered to perform the warrantless arrest of \"any alien who in [their] presence or view is entering or attempting to enter the United States in violation of any law or regulation made in pursuance of law regulating the admission, exclusion, expulsion, or removal of aliens . . . .\" The statute also requires that the detained alien \"shall be taken without unnecessary delay for examination before an officer of the [INS] having authority to examine aliens as to their right to enter or remain in the United States.\" Id. Although &#167; 1357(a)(2) does not, by its terms, reveal its \"civil\" or \"criminal\" character, it is accompanied by a provision authorizing the INS \"to make arrests for felonies which have been committed and which are cognizable under any law of the United States regulating the admission, exclusion, expulsion, or removal of aliens . . . .\" Id. &#167; 1357(a)(4) (emphasis added). Section 1357(a)(4), unlike &#167; 1357(a)(2), does not require that the alien be taken before an INS officer, but rather before \"the nearest available officer empowered to commit persons charged with offenses against the laws of the United States . . . .\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In giving distinct meaning to both provisions, courts have read &#167; 1357(a)(2) to apply to arrests of aliens for \"status offenses,\" or immigration-related offenses (such as illegal entry into the United States) that only apply to aliens, while interpreting &#167; 1357(a)(4) to apply to arrests of aliens for \"nonstatus offenses,\" i.e., crimes (such as assault) whose elements could be satisfied by any person, alien or not.

Mass. 1957) (Aldrich, J.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe that an offense under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(b)(2) qualifies as a \"status offense.\" By definition, the act of attempting to reenter the United States as a removed alien without the express consent of the Attorney General is an immigration-related offense that only aliens can commit. Moreover, and more to the point, the INS's primary purpose in investigating Encarnacion was, from the beginning, civil. Even though the documents contained in Encarnacion's INS file ultimately served as the catalyst for the filing of felony charges, the reason that the INS retrieved the file in the first place was to act on what they thought was a simple reinstatement of the prior removal order -- a civil matter. Upon receipt of Encarnacion's file, however, Ruz learned for the first time of Encarnacion's prior aggravated felonies, a discovery that caused him to change the treatment of the case from a deportation matter to a referral of possible criminal activity to the U.S. Attorney. It is in this context that Encarnacion was arrested and subsequently detained under the civil authority of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1357(a)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, we do not believe that Encarnacion's civil detention was a pretext for holding him in order to develop other criminal charges, nor do we find that his admission of illegal entry to INS officials transformed his case from a civil case to a criminal one. From the moment he was stopped at the San Juan airport, the INS was required by law to determine whether Encarnacion's application to enter the country was valid, and to this end, it immediately put into motion the administrative process of determining Encarnacion's status. His interview with Ruz, mandated by the \"taken without unnecessary delay . . . before an officer of the [INS]\" language of &#167; 1357(a)(2), amplified the INS's suspicions that Encarnacion's attempted entry was unlawful. But only after receiving the INS file on Encarnacion containing the prior deportation order had Ruz secured the \"probable cause\" necessary to initiate the criminal process under the applicable law and regulations. SeeMountain High Knitting, Inc. v. Reno, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"692372\"><a href=\"/opinion/692372/mountain-high-knitting-inc-mountain-high-hosiery-ltd-maria-palos-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">216</span></a></span>, 218 (9th Cir. 1995) (\"[A]lthough the lack of documentation or other admission of illegal presence may be some indication of illegal entry, it does not, without more, provide probable cause of the criminal violation of illegal entry.\") (emphasis added) (quoting Gonzales v. City of Peoria, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"427728\"><a href=\"/opinion/427728/raul-gonzales-v-the-city-of-peoria/\"><span class=\"volume\">722</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">468</span></a></span>, 476-77 (9th Cir. 1983)); 8 C.F.R. &#167; 241.8(a)(1) (requiring INS officers to obtain prior order of deportation in determining whether reinstatement-of-removal order is appropriate). Consequently, Encarnacion's case did not become criminal until Ruz's contact with the U.S. Attorney, and after that point, Encarnacion was brought expeditiously before the federal magistrate judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly, in most cases, prompt action by INS officials (and the availability of today's parcel-delivery services) should make it possible to transmit files between INS offices more quickly than seven days. Here, however, Encarnacion has presented no evidence (nor do we find any in the record) indicating that his detention was a dilatory tactic employed by the government for some impermissible purpose.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having determined that Encarnacion's arrest and detention were civil and nonpretextual, we have little trouble holding that Rule 5(a) did not render his eight-day detention unlawful. We agree with the Eleventh and Ninth Circuits' respective holdings in Noel, 231 F.3d at 837, and Cepeda-Luna, 989 F.2d at 358, that Rule 5(a) is inapplicable to civil deportation arrests and detentions under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1357(a)(2). Accordingly, we affirm the district court's denial of Encarnacion's motion to dismiss the indictment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. Application of the Sentencing Guidelines</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Encarnacion's other argument is that the district court erred in rejecting the joint request under the plea agreement to lower his criminal-history category, and in refusing to depart from the guidelines based on the \"atypical\" facts of his case. On this later point, he claims that his attempted reentry into the United States was merely an attempt to be reunited with his wife and children (who reside in this country) and that he possesses a sincere desire to enter drug rehabilitation so that he may take better care of his family. This type of argument, however, is squarely foreclosed by the guidelines themselves. As we have frequently held, a district court's refusal to depart from the guidelines may not be reviewed unless the court misconstrued its legal authority to depart. See, e.g., United States v. Savinon-Acosta, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199154\"><a href=\"/opinion/199154/united-states-v-savinon-acosta/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span>, 268 (1st Cir. 2000). In this case, the district court did not misapprehend its legal authority under the guidelines; its decision not to depart rested solely on its reasonable assessment of the facts of Encarnacion's case. Thus there is no basis to disturb the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Before the start of the conversation, Ruz told Encarnacion that the interview was related to Encarnacion's application to enter the United States.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Following the district court's analysis, Encarnacion argues, and the government seems to agree, that Rule 5(a) incorporates the Fourth Amendment's requirement of prompt determination of probable cause. See Gerstein v. Pugh, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109186\"><a href=\"/opinion/109186/gerstein-v-pugh/\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span>, 126 (1975) (holding that the Fourth Amendment requires \"prompt\" judicial determination of probable cause following a warrantless arrest); County of Riverside v.

While the Rule 5(a) and Fourth Amendment contexts are certainly \"analogous,\" Anderson v. Calderon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771178\"><a href=\"/opinion/771178/stephen-wayne-anderson-v-arthur-calderon-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1053</span></a></span>, 1104 (9th Cir. 2000) (McKeown, J., dissenting), the 48-hour rule is a requirement of the Fourth Amendment, not Rule 5(a).

In that case, however, the Ninth Circuit found that \"section 1357(a)(2) relaxed Rule 5(a) . . . for the examination of an alien's right to remain in the United States\" and that the INS need comply with Rule 5(a) only \"if the alien is being charged with a non-status offense.\" 603 F.2d at 791.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Like the district court, we acknowledge that the difference between civil and criminal detentions may appear formalistic, and that in practical terms an unnecessarily long detention under civil law is no better for the detainee than one under the criminal law.
