Edouard Gadoury, Jr.'s appeal covers an\r                            \r\n\nunfavorable decision by the Internal Revenue Service that he\r\n\n is a responsible person who willfully failed to pay over\r\n\n withheld payroll taxes, 26 U.S.C.   6672,1 the burden of\r\n\nproof being upon him, Caterino v. United States, 794 F.2d 1\r                                                            \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 480 U.S. 905 (1987); a finding\r                                         \r\n\nsupporting the IRS by the United States Bankruptcy Court;2\r\n\nfindings by a magistrate concluding that the bankruptcy court\r\n\n had not committed clear error, and the district court's\r\n\nconfirmation of the magistrate's findings.  Proof of clear\r\n\nerror is Gadoury's burden throughout; we do not have de novo\r                                                                         \r\n\n   review.  Id. at 5.  Unhappily, he has not succeeded.\r                             \r\n\nWe consider first a procedural point, in fact but a straw to\r\n\n which Gadoury, understandably, would cling.  When, by a\r\n\ncourse that we need not consider, he found himself in the\r\n\nbankruptcy court, Gadoury filed a motion for the court to\r\n\ndetermine that he had no   6672 liability.  The government,\r\n\n                  \r                                \r\n\n1.        (a) General rule.  Any person required to\r\n        collect, truthfully account  for, and pay\r\n        over any  tax imposed  by this  title who\r\n        willfully fails to  collect such tax,  or\r\n        truthfully account for and pay over  such\r\n        tax, or willfully  attempts in any manner\r\n        to  evade or defeat  any such tax  or the\r\n        payment  thereof, shall,  in addition  to\r\n        other  penalties  provided   by  law,  be\r\n        liable to  a penalty  equal to  the total\r\n        amount  of   the  tax   evaded,  or   not\r\n        collected, or not  accounted for and paid\r\n        over. . . .\r\n\n2.  Gadoury having ended up in a Chapter 7 proceeding.\r\n\n                           -2-\r\r\n\nerroneously interpreting the motion to be merely a request\r\n\nfor a hearing, awaited the court's response, only to discover\r\n\nthat the response was to allow the motion, in light of the\r\n\ngovernment's failure to reply.  The government then sought\r\n\nvigorously to have the order vacated under Fed.R.Civ.P. 55(e)\r\n\n(made applicable to adversary proceedings by Bankr. R. 7055)\r\n\nwhich prohibits entry of default against the United States\r\n\n unless plaintiff has presented evidence on the merits. \r\n\nAlternatively, it asserted good cause under Rule 55(c).  We\r\n\nfind no error either way in the court's rescission of the\r\n\n             order and proceeding to a trial.\r\n\nOur substantive start and, indeed, finish, is whether the\r\n\n district court properly refused to reject the bankruptcy\r\n\nfindings that Gadoury was responsible, and \"willfully\" failed\r\n\nto pay the payroll taxes, aided by the IRS's presumption of\r\n\n correctness with which it entered the bankruptcy court. \r\n\nCaterino, 794 F.2d at 5.  We are further reminded by that\r                      \r\n\n  opinion that such findings may be aided by unexpressed\r\n\ninferences if they reasonably appear to have been intended by\r\n\nthe court.  794 F.2d at 6 n.2.  Some of the facts found by\r\n\nthe bankruptcy court, plus some stipulated, are as follows:\r\n\nGadoury was hired by Sprague Company in 1986 as bookkeeper. \r\n\nHis title was changed to Controller.  As such he was not an\r\n\nofficer, but he could sign company checks, solo, and did sign\r\n\ncompany tax returns and tax checks.  The bankruptcy court,\r\n\n                           -3-\r\r\n\nhowever, correctly ruled, \"[T]he cases do say again and again\r\n\nthat just mere check writing authority is not enough.\"  There\r\n\nwas, of course, more.  The court found, on evidence that it\r\n\nbelieved, as well as the parties' stipulations, that Gadoury\r\n\nhad significant control over disbursement of the company's\r\n\nfunds, making him a responsible person.  For good measure, it\r\n\nalso found that he had received no special instructions not\r\n\nto pay.3  Gadoury fully disputed this evidence.  Looked at\r\n\nmost favorably to him it might be possible to find, in light\r\n\nof the company's business straits and poor cash flow, he not\r\n\nonly had special instructions not to pay, but that a broad\r\n\norder from his superior reduced his authority altogether,\r\n\nwith his superior taking over his duties.  The difficulty\r\n\nhere is that the superior denied this, and the court believed\r\n\nhim.  The fact that the court failed to discuss Gadoury's\r\n\nevidence, or state why it was not persuasive, does not make\r\n\n            its contrary findings clear error.\r\n\nAs to willfulness, Gadoury admitted that he was aware the\r\n\ntaxes were not being paid, that he urged them to be paid, but\r\n\nthat he failed to take any steps to see that they were in\r\n\n         fact paid.  There is no more to be said.\r\n\n                        Affirmed.\r                                               \r\n\n                  \r                                \r\n\n3.
