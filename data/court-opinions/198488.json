Gene Carter, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                                 \r\n\n                    Before\r\n\n          Torruella, Circuit Judge,\r\n       Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n         and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n                                 \r\n\nJohn G. S. Flym, with whom Liz Bostwick was on brief, for\r\nappellant.\r\nMargaret D. McGaughey, Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom\r\nJay P. McCloskey, U.S. Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.\r\n\n                                 \r\n\n                 May 27, 1999\r\n                                                    LYNCH, Circuit Judge.  A federal prisoner/parolee,\r\nconvicted of a serious crime committed twenty-five years ago, seeks\r\nto avoid the restrictions imposed by Congress in 1996 on successive\r\npetitions for post-conviction relief and argues that it is illegal\r\nand unconstitutional to deny him the ability to raise an argument\r\nabout the validity of his conviction that he could have raised\r\nproperly in 1990.  He has not shown that he is actually innocent\r\nand no claims of constitutional dimension are raised on these\r\nfacts.  Under the various applicable gatekeeping mechanisms, which\r\naugment society's interests in finality of criminal convictions\r\nwhere there has been no miscarriage of justice, he has not\r\nsatisfied the preconditions in 28 U.S.C.  2255, as amended by the\r\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\"AEDPA\"), that would\r\nallow him to have the merits of his claim reviewed.  He cannot\r\nevade the restrictions of  2255 by resort to the habeas statute,\r\n28 U.S.C.  2241, or the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C.  1651. \r\nResolution of this case involves exploration of the various\r\nstatutes and legal doctrines authorizing limited review of claims\r\nfor post-conviction relief.  Our conclusion is that while there are\r\nvery rare circumstances in which review may exist even if the\r\nrequirements of  2255 have not been met, this case presents none\r\nof those circumstances.\r\nJames Barrett was convicted of a bank robbery in federal\r\ncourt in 1984.  He brought an unsuccessful appeal in 1984 and an\r\nunsuccessful  2255 petition in 1990, and now seeks to bring\r\nanother petition attacking his conviction.  The primary legal\r\nquestions presented in this case are whether the petition before us\r\nis a \"second or successive\"  2255 petition, 28 U.S.C.  2255, and\r\nwhether Barrett may use  2241 or  1651 to bring a claim that\r\nwould otherwise be barred under  2255 and 28 U.S.C.  2244.  Each\r\nof these raises subsidiary questions; several are questions of\r\nfirst impression for this circuit.\r\n                     I\r\nIn 1975, three armed men wearing ski masks robbed a bank\r\nin Portland, Maine.  In 1984, James Barrett was tried for that\r\nrobbery.  Barrett denied any involvement; the chief prosecution\r\nwitness, Joseph Aceto, said Barrett did participate in the robbery. \r\nThe jury believed Aceto and not Barrett.  Barrett was convicted and\r\nsentenced to twenty years of imprisonment.  Barrett promptly filed\r\npost-trial motions for acquittal and a new trial, which the\r\ndistrict court denied.  See United States v. Barrett, 598 F. Supp.\r\n469 (D. Me. 1984).  His conviction was affirmed on direct appeal. \r\nSee United States v. Barrett, 766 F.2d 609 (1st Cir. 1985).\r\nIn 1990, Barrett filed a petition under  2255 and then\r\namended it.  The amended petition asserted claims under Brady v.\r\nMaryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), for the failure to disclose various\r\ndocuments, including a transcript of a government interview with\r\nAceto.  In a reply brief, Barrett tried to characterize the failure\r\nto disclose the transcript as a violation of the Jencks Act, 18\r\nU.S.C.  3500, as well as a Brady violation.  The district court\r\ndismissed the petition without addressing the belated and informal\r\nJencks Act claim.  See Barrett v. United States, 763 F. Supp. 658\r\n(D. Me. 1991).  This court affirmed the dismissal.  See Barrett v.\r\nUnited States, 965 F.2d 1184 (1st Cir. 1992).\r\nThis appeal, Barrett's third trip to this court for\r\nreview of the 1984 conviction, concerns his efforts to raise anew\r\nthe Jencks Act claim that was adverted to in the reply brief. \r\nHowever, since Barrett's 1990 petition was decided, Congress has\r\nenacted AEDPA, which places statutory restrictions on the filing of\r\nsecond or successive petitions under  2255.  Cutting through the\r\nprocedural morass presented, we find three essential questions for\r\nus to resolve:\r\n1.  Does Barrett present a \"second or successive\"  2255\r\npetition, as that term is defined under the 1996 AEDPA amendments,\r\nand, if so, is his petition barred because it does not meet AEDPA's\r\ngatekeeper requirements?\r\n2.  Does Barrett's claim fall within the savings clause\r\nof  2255, which permits a petitioner to seek relief under  2241\r\nif  2255 is \"inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his\r\ndetention\"?\r\n3.  Does the All Writs Act nonetheless provide Barrett\r\nwith a vehicle for raising his Jencks Act claim?\r\nThe answer to the first question is yes, and the answer\r\nto the second and third questions is no.  We affirm the dismissal\r\nof Barrett's petition.\r\n                     II\r\nWe describe in detail the travel of the issues to this\r\ncourt.  In June of 1990, Barrett filed a pro se petition under\r\n2555 requesting that his sentence be vacated or set aside.  The\r\ncourt appointed counsel, different counsel than in the instant\r\npetition.  Five months after Barrett's petition was first filed, he\r\nfiled an amended habeas petition, with counsel's assistance,\r\nalleging that the government had failed to disclose certain\r\nevidence.  Among that undisclosed evidence was a transcript of an\r\ninterview conducted in Arkansas by an FBI agent with Aceto, the\r\nchief prosecution witness.  This interview took place in the\r\npresence of the prosecuting Assistant U.S. Attorney (\"AUSA\") on\r\nJanuary 26, 1984, about two months before Barrett's trial.  Before\r\nthe trial, the government promised to disclose all prior statements\r\nby Aceto and provided Barrett with a redacted summary of the\r\ninterview on FBI Form 302.  But the government did not provide a\r\ncopy of the transcript, and that failure underlies the case before\r\nus.\r\nBarrett's 1990 amended  2255 petition alleged that the\r\nfailure to provide the interview transcript violated Brady.  On\r\nJanuary 4, 1991, the government responded to the amended petition;\r\nincluded in its response was an affidavit from the AUSA who was\r\npresent at the interview -- a different AUSA than represents the\r\ngovernment before us now.  The AUSA stated that the interview was\r\nconducted to assist the FBI in its investigation of two other\r\nsuspected participants in the bank robbery, who were fugitives at\r\nthe time and were considered extremely dangerous.  According to the\r\nAUSA, since security concerns were very high he \"never considered\r\nthe sensitive investigative information in the transcript as\r\ndiscoverable.\"\r\nOn February 19, 1991, Barrett filed \"Plaintiff's Motion\r\nfor Leave to File a Brief Reply Memorandum,\" which asserted that\r\n\"several legal arguments and factual assertions raised by the\r\ngovernment . . . require a response from plaintiff.\"  After the\r\ndistrict court granted this motion, Barrett filed a reply brief on\r\nFebruary 22, 1991; this brief raised for the first time a claim\r\nthat the failure to disclose the interview transcript violated the\r\nJencks Act.  Barrett did not seek to amend his  2255 petition to\r\nadd this claim, and the government did not respond to it.\r\nOn April 30, 1991, the district court dismissed the\r\namended petition without mentioning the Jencks Act claim.  The\r\ncourt did, however, extensively discuss the Arkansas interview\r\ntranscript in order to determine whether a constitutional violation\r\nhad occurred under Brady.  See Barrett, 763 F. Supp. at 662-63.  In\r\narguing to the district court that the government's failure to\r\nproduce the transcript made a constitutional difference, Barrett\r\nraised several specific purposes for which he would have used the\r\ntranscript to impeach Aceto.  See id. at 662.  Applying the test\r\nset forth in United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667 (1985), which\r\nstates that \"a constitutional error occurs, and the conviction must\r\nbe reversed, only if the evidence is material in the sense that its\r\nsuppression undermines confidence in the outcome of the trial,\" id.\r\nat 678, the court addressed each of these purposes and concluded,\r\nafter careful analysis, that its \"confidence in the outcome of the\r\ntrial [was] not diminished in any respect,\" Barrett, 763 F. Supp.\r\nat 662-63.  The court noted that \"Aceto was thoroughly impeached by\r\nfar more substantial means:  his mental illness, inconsistencies\r\nbetween trial and previous testimony, his prior criminal behavior,\r\nand his agreement with the government.  Yet the jury believed him.\" \r\nBarrett, 763 F. Supp. at 663 (footnote omitted).\r\nAfter the district court issued this opinion, Barrett's\r\ncounsel filed an unsigned and undated motion for reconsideration on\r\nthe ground that the Jencks Act claim had not been addressed.  That\r\nmotion was stricken on June 6, 1991 for failure to comply with\r\nvarious applicable rules requiring counsel's signature.  Two later\r\nmotions for reconsideration based on the same issue were filed and\r\ndenied.\r\nOn appeal to this court from the denial of the  2255\r\npetition, Barrett argued both the Jencks Act claim arising from the\r\nfailure to disclose the interview transcript and various Brady\r\nclaims.  This court affirmed the dismissal of the Brady claims. \r\nSee Barrett, 965 F.2d at 1188-92 &amp; n.15.  As to the Jencks Act\r\nclaim, this court held that the reply brief that first raised the\r\nclaim to the district court was not properly characterized as a\r\n\"traverse\"; that the motions to reconsider were untimely under\r\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e); and that, if the motions for\r\nreconsideration were considered Rule 60 motions, \"petitioner would\r\nfare no better, since the district court orders denying the motions\r\nwere never appealed.\"  Id. at 1187-88 &amp; n.3.  Accordingly, this\r\ncourt stated, \"as a practical matter, petitioner's failure to raise\r\nthe Jencks Act claim in a timely manner below preclude[d] effective\r\nappellate review on the merits.\"  Id. at 1188.\r\nThis court also suggested, \"without deciding,\" several\r\nconcerns about any future attempts by Barrett to raise the Jencks\r\nAct claim.  First, we expressed doubts about the viability of such\r\na claim under  2255, given \"the recognized rule that\r\nnonconstitutional claims may not be presented in a section 2255\r\nproceeding unless the claimed error of law [represents] a\r\nfundamental defect which inherently results in a complete\r\nmiscarriage of justice.\"  Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). \r\nSecond, we stated that a future attempt to raise the Jencks Act\r\nclaim would be \"a successive  2255 petition\" subject to \"abuse of\r\nthe writ\" analysis.  Id. at 1188 n.7 (citing McCleskey v. Zant, 499\r\nU.S. 467 (1991)).\r\nThe opinion of this court affirming the denial of the\r\n2255 petition was issued on June 8, 1992.  Barrett did nothing to\r\npursue his Jencks Act claim for four years.  On April 24, 1996,\r\nAEDPA became effective.  Barrett filed his current petition later\r\nin 1996.  AEDPA changed both the procedure for obtaining permission\r\nto bring a \"second or successive\"  2555 petition and the\r\nsubstantive standards that must be met to obtain such permission.\r\n                    III\r\nAEDPA Standards\r\nUnder AEDPA, a prisoner may file a second or successive\r\n2255 petition only if the court of appeals first certifies that\r\nthe petition is based on either:\r\n(1) newly discovered evidence that, if proven and viewed in\r\nlight of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to\r\nestablish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable\r\nfactfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense;\r\nor\r\n(2) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to\r\ncases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was\r\npreviously unavailable.\r\n\n28 U.S.C.  2255 (cross-referencing to  2244 certification\r\nrequirements); see also id.  2244(b)(3)(A) (requiring\r\nauthorization by the court of appeals \"[b]efore a second or\r\nsuccessive application . . . is filed in the district court\");\r\nFirst Cir. Interim Local Rule 22.2.  \"From the district court's\r\nperspective,\" these pre-clearance provisions are \"an allocation of\r\nsubject-matter jurisdiction to the court of appeals.\"  Nunez v.\r\nUnited States, 96 F.3d 990, 991 (7th Cir. 1996).  Therefore, \"a\r\ndistrict court, faced with an unapproved second or successive\r\nhabeas petition, must either dismiss it or transfer it to the\r\nappropriate court of appeals.\"  Pratt v. United States, 129 F.3d\r\n54, 57 (1st Cir. 1997) (citations omitted), cert. denied, 118 S.\r\nCt. 1807 (1998).\r\nAEDPA also requires a \"certificate of appealability\"\r\n(\"COA\") for an appeal of the final disposition of a  2255\r\npetition.  See 28 U.S.C.  2253(c)(1) (\"Unless a circuit justice or\r\njudge issues a certificate of appealability, an appeal may not be\r\ntaken to the court of appeals from . . . the final order in a\r\nproceeding under section 2255.\"); id.  2253(c)(2)-(3) (\"A\r\ncertificate of appealability may issue . . . only if the applicant\r\nhas made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional\r\nright. . . . The certificate of appealability . . . shall indicate\r\nwhich specific issue or issues satisfy [this] showing . . . .\");\r\nFed. R. App. P. 22(b).  This court has interpreted these provisions\r\nto permit the district courts to issue the requisite COAs, although\r\npetitioners may seek supplemental COAs from the court of appeals in\r\ncertain circumstances.  See Bui v. DiPaolo, 170 F.3d 232, 236-38\r\n(1st Cir. 1999); Grant-Chase v. Commissioner, New Hampshire Dep't\r\nof Corrections, 145 F.3d 431, 435 (1st Cir.) (noting that \"every\r\ncourt of appeals that has considered the question has concluded\r\nthat a district judge may issue a COA\"), cert. denied, 119 S. Ct.\r\n361 (1998).\r\nBarrett's 1996 Petition\r\nThese AEDPA provisions are applicable to our\r\nconsideration of Barrett's most recent petition.  In the late\r\nsummer of 1996, Barrett petitioned \"to set aside judgment of\r\nconviction and for such other and further relief as this Court may\r\ndeem appropriate,\" styling his petition as brought pursuant to 28\r\nU.S.C.  1651, 2241, 2255, and Article I,  9, clause 2 of the\r\nConstitution.  The magistrate judge issued an order returning the\r\npetition on the ground that it was a \"second or successive\"  2255\r\npetition that had not been pre-cleared by the court of appeals; the\r\ndistrict court, upon reviewing Barrett's objections, affirmed. \r\nBarrett appealed.  After proceedings not here relevant, the\r\ndistrict court treated the notice of appeal as a request for a COA\r\nand certified the following issue:\r\nWhether, in the circumstances of this case, the application of\r\nthe provisions of the [AEDPA], which bar the filing of\r\nsuccessive petitions under 28 U.S.C.  2255 absent an order of\r\nthe Court of Appeals authorizing the District Court to\r\nconsider the petition, so as to bar the filing of the petition\r\nherein, conflicts impermissibly with the All Writs Act, 28\r\nU.S.C.  1651, to deny Petitioner his federally protected\r\nrights of equal protection of the laws and of due process of\r\nlaw under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\nBarrett then filed an application for a COA in this court; we\r\nstated that the appeal could proceed to briefing \"[i]n view of this\r\ncourt's recent decision [in Grant-Chase] concluding that when a\r\ndistrict court has granted a [COA] on an issue, an appellant is not\r\nrequired to obtain a further certificate from this court with\r\nrespect to that issue.\"\r\nGiven this procedural history, this court has\r\njurisdiction to consider all three essential issues, outlined\r\nabove, necessary to resolve Barrett's appeal.  As to Barrett's\r\nclaim pursuant to  2255, our authority to consider the necessary\r\nissues is similar to the Pratt court's.  To the extent that Barrett\r\ncontends that AEDPA is not applicable to his claim, the district\r\ncourt's order is appealable and a COA has issued regarding the\r\npropriety of applying AEDPA.  See Pratt, 129 F.3d at 57-58; see\r\nalso In re Davenport, 147 F.3d 605, 607 (7th Cir. 1998).  To the\r\nextent that there is a question regarding the applicability of the\r\n\"second or successive\" provisions of AEDPA, we exercise our\r\ndiscretion to construe this appeal as an application to us for pre-\r\nclearance, and no COA is necessary.  See Pratt, 129 F.3d at 58;\r\nPease v. Klinger, 115 F.3d 763, 764 (10th Cir. 1997) (per curiam). \r\nFinally, as to Barrett's claim that he should have been allowed to\r\nproceed in the district court pursuant to  2241 or  1651, the COA\r\nand pre-clearance requirements are not directly applicable.  See\r\nDavenport, 147 F.3d at 607;  Valona v. United States, 138 F.3d 693,\r\n694 (7th Cir. 1998); Triestman v. United States, 124 F.3d 361, 373\r\nn.17 (2d Cir. 1997); McIntosh v. United States Parole Comm'n, 115\r\nF.3d 809, 810 n.1 (10th Cir. 1997); Salaam v. United States, No.\r\n98-CV-4244, 1998 WL 812634, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 20, 1998). \r\nBarrett's underlying substantive claim under the Jencks Act is\r\ntherefore before us only to the extent that the nature of that\r\nclaim is relevant to the determination of whether there is a means\r\navailable for asserting it.\r\n                     IV\r\nA.        \"Second or Successive\" Petition Under  2255\r\nWe begin by considering Barrett's claim under  2255.  It\r\nis clear that this provision is facially applicable to his\r\npetition:  he challenges the validity of his conviction; he is \"in\r\ncustody\"; his request for relief was made to the federal court\r\nthat sentenced him; and he himself invoked  2255 as a basis for\r\njurisdiction.  See Valona, 138 F.3d at 694-95.  The issue becomes\r\nhow his petition is affected by the \"second or successive\"\r\nrequirements applicable to  2255 petitions.  Barrett makes three\r\ngeneral arguments.  He says that this is really a first petition. \r\nEven if not technically a first petition, he says it should be\r\ntreated as one because he attempted to raise the Jencks Act claim\r\nin his first petition.  He also suggests that application of the\r\n\"second or successive\" requirements would be impermissibly\r\nretroactive and would raise constitutional problems.\r\nMeaning of \"Second or Successive\" and the Abuse of the Writ\r\nDoctrine\r\nAs Barrett points out, AEDPA leaves the phrase \"second or\r\nsuccessive\" undefined.  See Galtieri v. United States, 128 F.3d\r\n33, 35 (2d Cir. 1997) (\"[W]hen is a petition 'second or successive'\r\nwithin the meaning of . . . [AEDPA?]  Unfortunately, as with many\r\nlegal questions, the answer is: 'It depends.'\").  However, there is\r\nsignificant guidance as to whether Barrett's most recent petition\r\nfalls within the scope of AEDPA's \"second or successive\"\r\nrestrictions.  As an initial matter, courts construing the phrase\r\nhave generally applied pre-AEDPA abuse of the writ decisions.  See\r\nEsposito v. United States, 135 F.3d 111, 113 (2d Cir. 1997) (per\r\ncuriam); Pratt, 129 F.3d at 60; Reeves v. Little, 120 F.3d 1136,\r\n1138 (10th Cir. 1997) (per curiam).  As was true pre-AEDPA under\r\nthe abuse of the writ doctrine, \"a numerically second petition is\r\nnot 'second or successive' if it attacks a different criminal\r\njudgment or if the earlier petition terminated without a judgment\r\non the merits.\"  Pratt, 129 F.3d at 60; see also Esposito, 135 F.3d\r\nat 113.\r\nFurther definition is given in a series of post-AEDPA\r\ndecisions in this court and other courts of appeals.  A petition is\r\nnot \"second or successive\" when a state petitioner whose first\r\npetition was dismissed for failure to exhaust state remedies brings\r\na new petition based on exhausted claims.  See Carlson v. Pitcher,\r\n137 F.3d 416, 420 (6th Cir. 1998) (\"[T]he very sound rationales\r\nsupporting this result are not altered by the additional\r\nconsideration that the second-in-time petition may contain new\r\nhabeas claims not presented in the first petition.\"); McWilliams v.\r\nColorado, 121 F.3d 573, 575 (10th Cir. 1997); In re Gasery, 116\r\nF.3d 1051, 1052 (5th Cir. 1997) (per curiam); Christy v. Horn, 115\r\nF.3d 201, 208 (3d Cir. 1997) (holding that the concerns of finality\r\nand comity underlying the abuse of the writ doctrine \"are not\r\nimplicated when a petition is filed after a prior petition is\r\ndismissed for lack of exhaustion\"); In re Turner, 101 F.3d 1323,\r\n1323 (9th Cir. 1997) (per curiam) (noting that petitioner is\r\nraising the same claims that he raised in the prior petition that\r\nwas dismissed for lack of exhaustion); Dickinson v. Maine, 101 F.3d\r\n791, 791 (1st Cir. 1996) (per curiam); Camarano v. Irvin, 98 F.3d\r\n44, 46 (2d Cir. 1996) (per curiam) (\"[A]pplication of the\r\ngatekeeping provisions to deny a resubmitted petition in cases such\r\nas this would effectively preclude any federal habeas review and\r\nthus, would conflict with the doctrine of writ abuse, as understood\r\nboth before and after Felker . . . .  To foreclose further habeas\r\nreview in such cases would not curb abuses of the writ, but rather\r\nwould bar federal habeas review altogether.\"); cf. Denton v.\r\nNorris, 104 F.3d 166, 167 n.2 (8th Cir. 1997) (remarking that\r\n\"[t]here may be circumstances in which the statute should not be\r\nliterally and woodenly applied\").  These cases do not directly\r\napply to Barrett, who was convicted of a federal crime.\r\nOther decisions have created an exception for at least\r\nthree categories of cases: (1) where the earlier petition was\r\nrejected for failure to pay the filing fee or for mistakes in form,\r\nsee O'Connor v. United States, 133 F.3d 548, 550 (7th Cir. 1998);\r\nBenton v. Washington, 106 F.3d 162, 164-65 (7th Cir. 1996); (2)\r\nwhere the earlier petition was labeled a  2255 petition but\r\nactually was a  2241 petition challenging the execution rather\r\nthan the validity of the sentence, see Chambers v. United States,\r\n106 F.3d 472, 474-75 (2d Cir. 1997); and (3) where the second\r\npetition challenges parts of the judgment that arose as the result\r\nof the success of an earlier petition, see, e.g., In re Taylor, 171\r\nF.3d 185, 187-88 (4th Cir. 1999); Esposito, 135 F.3d at 113; Pratt,\r\n129 F.3d at 61-62; Walker v. Roth, 133 F.3d 454, 455 &amp; n.1 (7th\r\nCir. 1997) (per curiam); cf., e.g., Shepeck v. United States, 150\r\nF.3d 800, 801 (7th Cir. 1998) (per curiam).  These categories also\r\ndo not apply to Barrett.\r\nBarrett rather tries to build on the Supreme Court's\r\nrecent interpretation of the phrase \"second or successive\" in\r\nStewart v. Martinez-Villareal, 118 S. Ct. 1618 (1998).  In Stewart,\r\nthe Supreme Court held that a petition was not second or successive\r\nwithin the meaning of the AEDPA state habeas provisions when the\r\nclaim at issue had been raised in a previous petition but dismissed\r\nby the district court as premature and unripe (although the\r\ndistrict court had resolved the ripe claims presented in the first\r\npetition on their merits).\r\n[The most recent petition] may have been the second time that\r\nrespondent had asked the federal courts to provide relief on\r\nhis Ford claim, but this does not mean that there were two\r\nseparate applications, the second of which was necessarily\r\nsubject to [the second or successive provision].  There was\r\nonly one application for habeas relief, and the District Court\r\nruled (or should have ruled) on each claim at the time it\r\nbecame ripe.  Respondent was entitled to an adjudication of\r\nall of the claims presented in his earlier, undoubtedly\r\nreviewable, application for federal habeas relief.\r\nId. at 1621.  The Supreme Court compared the case before it to the\r\ncases involving dismissals for nonexhaustion, and explained that\r\n\"[t]o hold otherwise would mean that a dismissal of a first habeas\r\npetition for technical procedural reasons would bar the prisoner\r\nfrom ever obtaining federal habeas review.\"  Id. at 1622 (noting\r\nthat the Ford claim could not be decided at the time it was first\r\npresented because petitioner's \"execution was not imminent\").\r\nThe rationale of the Stewart decision does not help\r\nBarrett, but reinforces that his claim does not fall within an\r\nexception to the \"second or successive\" rule.   Part of the Stewart\r\nCourt's rationale for finding that the previously premature claims\r\nwere not second or successive was that those claims \"would not be\r\nbarred under any form of res judicata.\"  Id.  The core of the AEDPA\r\nrestrictions on second or successive  2255 petitions is related to\r\nthe longstanding judicial and statutory restrictions embodied in\r\nthe form of res judicata known as the \"abuse of the writ\" doctrine. \r\nAs the Supreme Court noted in Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651\r\n(1996), as to similar restrictions on  2254 petitions, \"[t]he new\r\nrestrictions on successive petitions constitute a modified res\r\njudicata rule, a restraint on what is called in habeas corpus\r\npractice 'abuse of the writ.'\"  Id. at 664; see also O'Connor, 133\r\nF.3d at 550 (stating that \"the idea . . . is that a prisoner is\r\nentitled to one, but only one, full and fair opportunity to wage a\r\ncollateral attack\").\r\nCases in which numerically second petitions have not been\r\ntreated as \"second or successive\" can be understood as describing\r\nfactual scenarios in which the application of a modified res\r\njudicata rule would not make sense.  See Vancleave v. Norris, 150\r\nF.3d 926, 928 (8th Cir. 1998) (stating that Stewart recognizes\r\n\"that some types of 'second' petitions do not implicate the\r\njudicially developed abuse-of-the-writ principles that were the\r\nbasis for AEDPA's statutory restrictions\"); Camarano, 98 F.3d at\r\n46-47 (analogizing to civil claim preclusion doctrine); 2 Liebman\r\n&amp; Hertz, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure  28.3a, at\r\n275 (2d ed. Supp. 1997) (\"Applying the no-second-bite rule makes no\r\nsense when a prior petition gave the prisoner what amounts to no\r\nbite at the apple -- because the prior petition involved a\r\ndifferent apple, because no bite was taken when the apple\r\npreviously was before the court, or because no bite could have been\r\ntaken at that time because the claim had not yet come into\r\nexistence or would not have been cognizable at the time of the\r\nearlier petition.\"  (emphasis in original)); see also id.  28.3b,\r\nat 1163-71 (3d ed. 1998).  We do not purport to define the full\r\nscope of the phrase \"second or successive.\"  However, as a general\r\nmatter, if a petition falls under the modified res judicata rule\r\nknown as the abuse of the writ doctrine -- because, for example, it\r\nraises a claim that could have been properly raised and decided in\r\na previous  2255 petition -- it also falls within the definition\r\nof \"second or successive.\"  Once the petition is defined as\r\n\"second or successive,\" review occurs only if certain requirements\r\nare met.\r\nApplication to Barrett's 1996 Petition\r\nApplying these principles, we conclude that Barrett's\r\ncurrent petition is a \"second or successive\" one.  This petition\r\ndoes not fit into any of the exceptions described above:  Barrett's\r\n1990 petition, which was undisputedly brought pursuant to  2255,\r\nwas dismissed on the merits (although the Jencks Act claim was not\r\nconsidered); his current petition challenges the same judgment that\r\nwas challenged in his 1990 petition; and there has been no new\r\njudgment or amendment of sentence.  See Thomas v.\r\nSuperintendent/Woodbourne Corr. Facility, 136 F.3d 227, 229-30 (2d\r\nCir. 1997) (per curiam). \r\nFurther, there is no question that Barrett's Jencks Act\r\nclaim was available and, unlike the Ford claim at issue in Stewart,\r\ncould have been both brought and adjudicated at the time of the\r\nfirst petition.  Barrett had the transcript of the interview with\r\nAceto at the time he brought the Brady claim in the 1990 petition. \r\nAlthough Barrett leans heavily on the contention that his Jencks\r\nAct claim was not available until after the filing of the AUSA's\r\naffidavit, which he characterizes as an admission of bad faith, it\r\ncannot be that a Jencks Act claim asserting bad faith is\r\nunavailable until there has been a direct admission from the\r\nprosecutor -- a circumstance that is surely a rare one.  Assuming\r\nthat the existence of bad faith was necessary in order to raise the\r\nclaim, Barrett had in front of him various facts from which he\r\ncould have marshaled a reasonable argument to that effect.  Cf.\r\nMcCleskey v. Zant, 499 U.S. 467, 498-500 (1991) (explaining that\r\n\"cause\" for the failure to raise a claim is not established if\r\n\"petitioner possessed . . . a sufficient basis to allege a claim in\r\nthe first petition and pursue the matter through the habeas\r\nprocess\" (citing  2254 provisions on discovery, expansion of the\r\nrecord, and evidentiary hearing)).  Indeed, Barrett's own brief to\r\nus on this appeal seems to construct an argument -- that total\r\nsuppression is equivalent to willful destruction, which is\r\nequivalent to an \"elect[ion] not to comply\" with the Act, 18 U.S.C.\r\n3500(d) -- that does not rely on any government admissions.  See\r\nAppellant's Brief at 26-27.\r\nBarrett now asserts that he should be excused from his\r\nfailure to raise the Jencks Act claim in his first petition\r\nbecause, he says, filing such a claim prior to the submission of\r\nthe AUSA's affidavit would amount to a violation of Rule 11.  That\r\nis not so.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(3) (stating that an attorney\r\npresenting a pleading certifies that \"to the best of the person's\r\nknowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry\r\nreasonable under the circumstances, . . . the allegations and other\r\nfactual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so\r\nidentified, are likely to have evidentiary support after a\r\nreasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery\");\r\nNavarro-Ayala v. Nunez, 986 F.2d 1421, 1425 (1st Cir. 1992);\r\nLancellotti v. Fay, 909 F.2d 15, 19 (1st Cir. 1990); see also 1\r\nLiebman &amp; Hertz, supra,  11.3b, at 488-89 (3d ed. 1998) (\"[A]\r\nreasonable, even if as yet unconfirmed, belief that a meritorious\r\nfact-based claim exists may oblige the prisoner . . . to raise the\r\nclaim and to pursue it via, e.g., court-funded investigation . . .\r\n, discovery, an evidentiary hearing, and other fact-development\r\nprocedures of the sort that often are not fully available to\r\nprisoners until they file a habeas corpus petition.  Thus, as\r\nJustice O'Connor has stated, referring . . . to McCleskey, the\r\nCourt's 'carefully crafted doctrines of waiver and abuse of the\r\nwrit make it especially important that the first petition\r\nadequately set forth all of a state prisoner's colorable grounds\r\nfor relief.'\"  (quoting McFarland v. Scott, 512 U.S. 849, 860\r\n(1994) (O'Connor, J., concurring in the judgment in part))\r\n(footnote omitted)); Rule 6 Governing Section 2255 Proceedings for\r\nthe United States District Courts.\r\nFurther, even assuming that the AUSA's affidavit was more\r\nthan simply \"evidence discovered later [that] might also have\r\nsupported or strengthened the [existing] claim,\"  McCleskey, 499\r\nU.S. at 498, Barrett also had the option of seeking to amend his\r\npetition again to add the claim.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 15 (stating\r\nthat \"leave [to amend] shall be freely given when justice so\r\nrequires\"); Rule 12 Governing Section 2255 Proceedings for the\r\nUnited States District Courts; United States v. Craycraft, 167 F.3d\r\n451, 457 &amp; n.6 (8th Cir. 1999); 2 Liebman &amp; Hertz, supra,  28.1,\r\nat 1145-46 (3d ed. 1998) (\"If claims become available after the\r\nhabeas corpus petition is filed, the petitioner generally should\r\namend the new claims into the petition at the earliest possible\r\nopportunity . . . .\").  He did not even attempt to do so.  Cf. In\r\nre Hill, 113 F.3d 181, 183 (11th Cir. 1997) (per curiam) (stating\r\nthat \"the liberal amendment policy applicable to habeas petitions\r\nmay make [new] claims . . . 'available' to the petitioner during a\r\nprior habeas action, even when the claim would not have been\r\navailable at the inception of that prior action\").\r\nBarrett also makes a separate argument.  He argues that\r\nthe Jencks Act claim was in fact properly presented in his first\r\npetition and that he should not be penalized for the failure of the\r\ncourt to address it.  While such a situation is conceivable, cf.\r\nWainwright v. Norris, 121 F.3d 339, 340-41 (8th Cir. 1997), it is\r\nnot the situation that we face here.  This court has already\r\nrejected Barrett's argument that he properly presented the Jencks\r\nAct claim by traverse and has held that the district court did not\r\nerr in failing to rule on the claim.  See Barrett, 965 F.2d at\r\n1187-88 &amp; n.3.  Whether we consider this holding to be law of the\r\ncase or law of the circuit (indeed, we have relied on it in\r\nsubsequent opinions), Barrett's challenge to it, which largely\r\nconsists of citations to factually and legally distinguishable\r\ncases, has not provided us with a rationale for disturbing our own\r\nprevious resolution of the issue.  See Lacy v. Gardino, 791 F.2d\r\n980, 984-85 (1st Cir. 1986); see also Shore v. Warden, Stateville\r\nPrison, 942 F.2d 1117, 1123 (7th Cir. 1991); Aldridge v. Dugger,\r\n925 F.2d 1320, 1326 (11th Cir. 1991); cf. Jeffries v. Wood, 114\r\nF.3d 1484, 1492 (9th Cir.) (en banc), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 586\r\n(1997); Singleton v. United States, 26 F.3d 233, 240 (1st Cir.\r\n1994); United States v. Michaud, 925 F.2d 37, 43 (1st Cir. 1991).\r\nBarrett's Jencks Act claim was not dismissed without\r\nprejudice when his first petition was decided, or missed through\r\nsome error of the court's.  The situation presented here is\r\ntherefore equivalent to the common situation in which a petitioner\r\nwho has failed to raise an available claim in his first petition\r\nattempts to raise that claim in a later petition.  That situation\r\nclearly falls within the \"second or successive\" rule, even though\r\nthe claim has never been adjudicated on the merits.  See Pratt, 129\r\nF.3d at 62 (\"As a general rule, a prisoner who had both the\r\nincentive and the ability to raise a particular claim in his first\r\npetition for post-conviction relief, but declined to assert it,\r\ncannot raise it the second time around.\"); see also Corrao v.\r\nUnited States, 152 F.3d 188, 191 (2d Cir. 1998) (\"Generally, a\r\n2255 petition is 'second or successive' if a prior  2255\r\npetition, raising claims regarding the same conviction or sentence,\r\nhas been decided on the merits.  This remains true even if the\r\nlatter petition purports to raise new claims.\"  (citation\r\nomitted)).\r\n          As we stated in Pratt, \r\nThe requirement that all available claims be presented in a\r\nprisoner's first habeas petition is consistent not only with\r\nthe spirit of AEDPA's restrictions on second and successive\r\nhabeas petitions, but also with the preexisting abuse of the\r\nwrit principle.  The requirement serves the singularly\r\nsalutary purpose of forcing federal habeas petitioners to\r\nthink through all potential post-conviction claims and to\r\nconsolidate them for a unitary presentation to the district\r\ncourt.  This exercise advances the cause of judicial\r\nefficiency and further justifies barring [petitioner]'s second\r\npetition.\r\n\nPratt, 129 F.3d at 61.  Accordingly, Barrett's  2255 petition is\r\n\"second or successive\" within the meaning of AEDPA -- the result we\r\nsuggested in our previous, pre-AEDPA decision in this case.  See\r\nBarrett, 965 F.2d at 1188 n.7.\r\nThe Retroactivity Argument and the Pre-AEDPA Test\r\nBarrett contends that, even if we construe his petition\r\nas a \"second or successive\"  2255 petition, he meets the\r\nrequirements for proceeding in the district court because the\r\nrestrictions in AEDPA on such petitions should not apply to him. \r\nDespite the instruction in Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U.S. 320 (1997),\r\nthat the provisions of AEDPA govern petitions filed after April 24,\r\n1996, see id. at 326-27; Pratt, 129 F.3d at 58, Barrett ignores the\r\nAEDPA amendments to  2255.  Barrett instead confines his argument\r\nto the terms of the test set forth in McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U.S.\r\n467 (1991), which is less restrictive than the AEDPA amendments,\r\nsee Galtieri, 128 F.3d at 35-36; Benton, 106 F.3d at 163.\r\nBarrett attempts to justify his avoidance of AEDPA by\r\nasserting that the 1996 amendments may not be applied\r\n\"retroactively\" to him given that his first petition was brought\r\nbefore the enactment of AEDPA.  We construe his somewhat\r\nabbreviated argument to be that he relied on the law as it existed\r\nbefore AEDPA in his approach to the Jencks Act claim in his first\r\npetition, and that this reliance interest deserves protection.  We\r\nhave not adopted this so-called \"mousetrapping\" doctrine, see \r\nBurris v. Parke, 95 F.3d 465, 468-69 (7th Cir. 1996) (en banc), \r\nand do not do so now.  As we did in Pratt, we will assume arguendo\r\nthat the doctrine is applicable and briefly consider whether\r\nBarrett's claim meets the \"notoriously difficult to pass\" pre-AEDPA\r\ntest in order to determine whether Barrett may have somehow relied\r\non the prior state of the law.  Pratt, 129 F.3d at 58-59; see also\r\nUnited States v. Ortiz, 136 F.3d 161, 166 (D.C. Cir. 1998). \r\nUnder the pre-AEDPA test, a petitioner's failure to raise\r\na claim in a prior petition was excused in either one of two\r\nsituations.  The first was where the petitioner \"show[ed] cause for\r\nfailing to raise [the claim] and prejudice therefrom.\"  McCleskey,\r\n499 U.S. at 494; see also Andiarena v. United States, 967 F.2d 715,\r\n717 (1st Cir. 1992).  \"Cause\" is \"some external impediment, such as\r\ngovernment interference or the reasonable unavailability of the\r\nfactual or legal basis for a claim.\"  Andiarena, 967 F.2d at 718\r\n(citing McCleskey, 499 U.S. at 497); see also Simpson v. Matesanz,\r\nNo. 98-2343, 1999 WL 257319, at *10-12 (1st Cir. May 4, 1999)\r\n(citing Bousley v. United States, 118 S. Ct. 1604, 1611 (1998));\r\nWhittemore v. United States, 986 F.2d 575, 578 (1st Cir. 1993). \r\nThe second situation was a showing of a \"fundamental miscarriage of\r\njustice,\" defined as an \"extraordinary instance[] when a\r\nconstitutional violation probably has caused the conviction of one\r\ninnocent of the crime.\"  McCleskey, 499 U.S. at 494.  \"[T]he\r\nmiscarriage of justice exception is concerned with actual as\r\ncompared to legal innocence.\"  Calderon v. Thompson, 118 S. Ct.\r\n1489, 1502-03 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also\r\nSimpson, 1999 WL 257319, at *10.  To establish \"actual innocence,\"\r\na \"petitioner must demonstrate that, in light of all the evidence,\r\nit is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have\r\nconvicted him.\"  Bousley, 118 S. Ct. at 1611 (internal quotation\r\nmarks omitted).\r\nHere, for the reasons already explained, Barrett is\r\nunable to demonstrate cause.  He had the opportunity to raise his\r\nclaim properly at the time of his first petition, but he did not\r\ntake advantage of it.  See McCleskey, 499 U.S. at 498-500.  Whether\r\nor not his failure to do so was intentional is of no moment.  See\r\nid. at 489-90 (holding that \"a petitioner can abuse the writ by\r\nraising a claim in a subsequent petition that he could have raised\r\nin his first, regardless of whether the failure to raise it earlier\r\nstemmed from a deliberate choice\"); see also Wainwright v. Sykes,\r\n433 U.S. 72, 85-90 (1977) (rejecting the \"deliberate bypass\"\r\nstandard articulated in Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391 (1963)).\r\nNor can Barrett demonstrate actual innocence.  Despite\r\ncounsel's strong pronouncement at oral argument of Barrett's\r\ninnocence, Barrett's claim reduces to a complicated legal argument\r\n(analogous to an argument for the suppression of evidence in the\r\nFourth Amendment context):  that the Arkansas interview was Jencks\r\nAct material; that the government \"elect[ed] not to comply\" with a\r\ncourt order to turn it over and acted in bad faith; that the remedy\r\nunder the Act would be to strike Aceto's testimony in its entirety;\r\nthat without Aceto's testimony Barrett would not have been\r\nconvicted; and that Barrett's conviction is therefore faulty.  18\r\nU.S.C.  3500(d); cf. Embrey v. Hershberger, 131 F.3d 739, 741 (8th\r\nCir. 1997) (en banc) (\"[Petitioner] has conflated his gateway and\r\nhis ultimate legal claim . . . .\"), cert. denied, 119 S. Ct. 78\r\n(1998).  Such an assertion of \"legal\" innocence is not sufficient. \r\nSee Bousley, 118 S. Ct. at 1611 (stating that \"'actual innocence'\r\nmeans factual innocence, not mere legal insufficiency\").  And it\r\nhas already been determined, through Barrett's prior petition, that\r\nthe evidence the government failed to produce was not material in\r\na constitutional sense -- that is, that it would not raise a\r\nreasonable probability of a different outcome.  See Barrett, 965\r\nF.2d at 1188-93 &amp; n.15; see also Calderon, 118 S. Ct. at 1503-04;\r\nBurks v. Dubois, 55 F.3d 712, 718 (1st Cir. 1995). \r\nBarrett has not demonstrated that there would be any\r\nimpermissible retroactive consequences to applying the AEDPA\r\nrestrictions to his current petition, even assuming arguendo that\r\nis the proper test.  Under these AEDPA restrictions, of course, we\r\nreach the same conclusion that we reached under McCleskey.  Barrett\r\nhas not argued that he satisfies either of the two AEDPA\r\npreconditions for filing a second or successive  2255 petition,\r\nand he patently does not.  Therefore, we turn to whether this case\r\nfits within the savings clause of  2255.\r\nB.        The Savings Clause in  2255: \"Inadequate or Ineffective\" \r\nRemedy\r\nSince Barrett may not proceed with his  2255 petition,\r\nwe turn to his argument that the savings clause of  2255 permits\r\nhim to proceed under  2241 as a means of seeking relief.  See 28\r\nU.S.C.  2241 (stating that \"[w]rits of habeas corpus may be\r\ngranted by the Supreme Court, any justice thereof, the district\r\ncourts and any circuit judge within their respective jurisdictions\"\r\nunder specified circumstances).\r\nWe begin with the limitation on the use of  2241\r\npetitions by federal prisoners that is set forth in  2255:  \r\nAn application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a\r\nprisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion\r\npursuant to [ 2255], shall not be entertained if it appears\r\nthat the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion,\r\nto the court which sentenced him, or that such court has\r\ndenied him relief, unless it also appears that the remedy by\r\nmotion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of\r\nhis detention.\r\n\nThis circuit has not previously defined the phrase \"inadequate or\r\nineffective\" or analyzed its scope.\r\nA petition under  2255 cannot become \"inadequate or\r\nineffective,\" thus permitting the use of  2241, merely because a\r\npetitioner cannot meet the AEDPA \"second or successive\"\r\nrequirements.  Such a result would make Congress's AEDPA amendment\r\nof  2255 a meaningless gesture.  See, e.g., In re Davenport, 147\r\nF.3d 605, 608 (7th Cir. 1998) (\"Congress did not change [the\r\n\"inadequate or ineffective\"] language when in the Antiterrorism Act\r\nit imposed limitations on the filing of successive 2255 motions. \r\nThe retention of the old language opens the way to the argument\r\nthat when the new limitations prevent the prisoner from obtaining\r\nrelief under 2255, his remedy under that section is inadequate and\r\nhe may turn to 2241.  That can't be right; it would nullify the\r\nlimitations.\"); Triestman v. United States, 124 F.3d 361, 376 (2d\r\nCir. 1997) (\"If it were the case that any prisoner who is prevented\r\nfrom bringing a  2255 petition could, without more, establish that\r\n2255 is 'inadequate or ineffective,' . . . then Congress would\r\nhave accomplished nothing at all in its attempts -- through\r\nstatutes like the AEDPA -- to place limits on federal collateral\r\nreview.\"); In re Dorsainvil, 119 F.3d 245, 251 (3d Cir. 1997)\r\n(stating that inadequacy or ineffectiveness cannot be established\r\n\"merely because th[e] petitioner is unable to meet the stringent\r\ngatekeeping requirements of the amended  2255,\" because \"[s]uch a\r\nholding would effectively eviscerate Congress's intent in amending\r\n2255\"); In re Vial, 115 F.3d 1192, 1194 n.5 (4th Cir. 1997) (en\r\nbanc) (stating that  2255 is not inadequate or ineffective simply\r\n\"because an individual is procedurally barred from filing a  2255\r\nmotion\").\r\nSuch a reading of the savings clause would also recreate\r\nthe serious structural problems that led Congress to enact  2255\r\nin the first place.  See In re Hanserd, 123 F.3d 922, 925, 934 n.19\r\n(6th Cir. 1997) (\"If [petitioner] and similarly situated inmates\r\nproceed under habeas corpus [which must be brought in the district\r\nwith jurisdiction over the custodian], . . . courts located near\r\nlarge federal prisons will be inundated with such motions, and\r\nwitnesses and court records will have to travel thousands of miles\r\nto the situs of these habeas hearings, which would be held before\r\na judge unfamiliar with the case.\"); see also United States v.\r\nHayman, 342 U.S. 205, 210-14 (1952) (discussing the \"practical\r\nproblems\" that prompted the enactment of  2255).\r\nYet the  2255 savings clause, which has been interpreted\r\nto avoid constitutional questions about  2255, see Davenport, 147\r\nF.3d at 609, must mean something.  In three recent cases, the\r\nSeventh, Third, and Second Circuits have addressed the meaning of\r\nthe \"inadequate or ineffective\" language and given it content.  All\r\nthree cases involved a factual scenario in which the petitioner's\r\nfirst  2255 petition had been resolved prior to the Supreme\r\nCourt's decision in Bailey v. United States, 516 U.S. 137 (1995).\r\nUnder Bailey's statutory interpretation, actions for which the\r\npetitioner had been convicted were in fact not criminal at all, but\r\nthe petitioner's second petition, which raised a Bailey claim, was\r\nbarred by the AEDPA \"second or successive\" rules.\r\nIn interpreting the savings clause, the Seventh Circuit\r\nin Davenport looked to the essential function of habeas corpus.  It\r\ncharacterized that function as \"giv[ing] a prisoner a reasonable\r\nopportunity to obtain a reliable judicial determination of the\r\nfundamental legality of his conviction and sentence.\"  Davenport,\r\n147 F.3d at 609.  The court stated that a prisoner who \"had a\r\nchance to raise the question\" at issue in his appeal and his first\r\n2255 petition had already had his reasonable opportunity, and did\r\nnot need another \"procedural shot at getting his sentence vacated.\" \r\nId. at 609-10 (\"Society . . . is unwilling to expend indefinitely\r\nlarge judicial resources on repeated testing of the accuracy of a\r\ndetermination of guilt.\").  However, the court concluded that\r\n2241 was available where a Bailey claim simply could not have\r\nbeen presented on direct appeal or in a first petition, stating\r\nthat \"[a] procedure for postconviction relief can fairly be termed\r\ninadequate when it is so configured as to deny a convicted\r\ndefendant any opportunity for judicial rectification of so\r\nfundamental a defect in his conviction as having been imprisoned\r\nfor a nonexistent offense.\"  Id. at 611; see also id. (\"A federal\r\nprisoner should be permitted to seek habeas corpus only if he had\r\nno reasonable opportunity to obtain earlier judicial correction of\r\na fundamental defect in his conviction or sentence because the law\r\nchanged after his first 2255 motion.\").\r\nThe Seventh Circuit's holding in Davenport is very\r\nsimilar to the Third Circuit's holding in Dorsainvil that  2241\r\nrelief is available in the \"unusual circumstance\" in which\r\napplication of the AEDPA \"second or successive\" limitations would\r\nresult in a \"complete miscarriage of justice.\"  Dorsainvil, 119\r\nF.3d at 251 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Like Davenport,\r\nDorsainvil stressed that the petitioner had not had an earlier\r\nopportunity to raise his Bailey claim; the court also pointed out\r\nthat \"[t]he government has not suggested that Dorsainvil has abused\r\nthe writ, the principal situation that the AEDPA was intended to\r\neliminate.\"  Id.  Further, the court emphasized that its holding\r\nwas a \"narrow one\" and was not intended to interfere with\r\napplication of the  2255 gatekeeping provisions.  See id. at 251-\r\n52 (\"[A]llowing someone in Dorsainvil's unusual position -- that of\r\na prisoner who had no earlier opportunity to challenge his\r\nconviction for a crime that an intervening change in substantive\r\nlaw may negate, even when the government concedes that such a\r\nchange should be applied retroactively -- is hardly likely to\r\nundermine the gatekeeping provisions of  2255.\").\r\nDavenport and Dorsainvil are also similar to, but\r\ndistinct from, the Second Circuit's holding in Triestman that a\r\nfederal prisoner can seek  2241 habeas corpus in \"the set of cases\r\nin which the petitioner cannot, for whatever reason, utilize\r\n2255, and in which the failure to allow for collateral review\r\nwould raise serious constitutional questions.\"  Triestman, 124 F.3d\r\nat 377.  The Triestman court found that such serious questions were\r\nraised where \"a person . . . can prove his actual innocence on the\r\nexisting record\" and \"could not have effectively raised his claim\r\nof innocence at an earlier time.\"  Id. at 363, 377-78; see also id.\r\nat 368 n.8 (concluding that the petition at hand would not have\r\nbeen barred under the pre-AEDPA \"abuse of the writ\" doctrine). \r\n\"[T]he cases in which serious questions as to  2255's\r\nconstitutional validity are presented will be relatively few . .\r\n. .  In reaching this result, we therefore respect Congress' intent\r\nto streamline collateral review and to discourage repetitive and\r\npiecemeal litigation, while at the same time we give meaning to\r\nCongress' express decision (reaffirmed in the AEDPA) to preserve\r\nhabeas corpus for federal prisoners in those extraordinary\r\ninstances where justice demands it.\"  Id. at 377-78.\r\nTo the extent that these cases were concerned with the\r\nstatus of a petitioner's claim under pre-AEDPA abuse of the writ\r\nlaw, they may have been narrowed, in effect, by the holding of the\r\nSupreme Court in Bousley v. United States, 118 S. Ct. 1604 (1998). \r\nBousley did not address the savings clause, but did hold on a\r\nfederal prisoner's first petition under  2255 that \"cause\"\r\nexcusing failure to make an argument was not shown by the\r\n\"futility\" of the argument.  See id. at 1611, cited in Simpson,\r\n1999 WL 257319, at *11-12.  But Bousley retained an actual\r\ninnocence exception and remanded the case so petitioner had the\r\nopportunity to show his actual innocence.  See id. at 1611-12.\r\nWe agree with the Davenport, Dorsainvil, and Triestman\r\ncourts that habeas corpus relief under  2241 remains available for\r\nfederal prisoners in limited circumstances.  See also In re\r\nHanserd, 123 F.3d at 929-30 (asserting without discussion that\r\n\"[i]f AEDPA bars [petitioner] from raising his Bailey issue in a\r\n2255 motion, he could file a habeas petition pursuant to [the\r\ninadequate and ineffective] provision\"); United States v.\r\nLorentsen, 106 F.3d 278, 279 (9th Cir. 1997) (suggesting that \r\npetitioner making a newly available Bailey claim could use  2241,\r\nbut not deciding the question because no request for  2241 relief\r\nhad been sought before the district court).  But it is not\r\nnecessary in this case to articulate those circumstances precisely\r\n-- we leave that task for another day.  Applying any of the\r\nappropriately narrow standards described above clearly demonstrates\r\nthat petitioner is not entitled to  2241 habeas relief in this\r\ncase.\r\nBarrett's claim does not raise a question of actual\r\ninnocence, as the post-Bailey claims of the petitioners in\r\nDavenport, Dorsainvil, and Triestman arguably did.  See Triestman,\r\n124 F.3d at 378-79; cf. In re Jones, 137 F.3d 1271, 1273 n.3 (11th\r\nCir.) (per curiam), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 1351 (1998); McDonald\r\nv. Bowersox, 125 F.3d 1183, 1186 (8th Cir. 1997) (\"Accordingly, we\r\nneed not decide whether, and in what circumstances, a claim of\r\nactual innocence can allow us to waive  2244(b)(2)'s requirements\r\nfor our approval of a successive habeas petition.\"); Bush v.\r\nSingletary, 99 F.3d 373, 375 (11th Cir. 1996) (per curiam). \r\nFurther, where a prisoner had an opportunity to present his claim\r\nproperly in his first  2255 petition, but failed to do so, any\r\n\"ineffectiveness\" of his current  2255 petition is due to him and\r\nnot to  2255.  See United States v. Walker, 980 F. Supp. 144, 146\r\n(E.D. Pa. 1997); cf. United States v. Logan, 22 F. Supp. 2d 691,\r\n694 (W.D. Mich. 1998) (\"The Court concludes that any\r\n'ineffectiveness' in this matter is attributable not to  2255, but\r\nto Petitioner, for failure to file within [the AEDPA statute of\r\nlimitations] period.\"); Mejia v. INS, No. 97 C 6191, 1998 WL 26163,\r\nat *2 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 16, 1998).\r\nNor is a serious constitutional question raised by the\r\nfact that AEDPA bars Barrett's claim from being heard on the\r\nmerits.  We need not reach the issue of the extent to which a\r\nJencks Act claim may ever be of constitutional dimension.  The\r\ndecision on Barrett's prior  2255 petition determined that the use\r\nof the nondisclosed material would not have made a difference in\r\nthe outcome of the trial.  Barrett could have raised his claim in\r\nhis first petition, and Congress may constitutionally treat \"second\r\nor successive\" petitions differently than first ones.  See Lonchar\r\nv. Thomas, 517 U.S. 314, 323-25 (1996); cf. Davenport, 147 F.3d at\r\n610.  The Supreme Court has already determined that the AEDPA\r\n\"second or successive\" restrictions applicable to  2254 do not\r\nviolate the Suspension Clause, and that reasoning is applicable\r\nhere.  See Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, 664 (1996) (\"In\r\nMcCleskey . . . , we said that 'the doctrine of abuse of the writ\r\nrefers to a complex and evolving body of equitable principles\r\ninformed and controlled by historical usage, statutory\r\ndevelopments, and judicial decisions.'  The added restrictions\r\nwhich the Act places on second habeas petitions are well within the\r\ncompass of this evolutionary process, and we hold that they do not\r\namount to a 'suspension' of the writ contrary to Article I,  9.\" \r\n(citations omitted) (quoting McCleskey, 499 U.S. at 489, and citing\r\nU.S. Const. Art. I,  9, cl. 2 (\"The Privilege of the Writ of\r\nHabeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of\r\nRebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\"))); see\r\nalso Graham v. Johnson, 168 F.3d 762, 787 (5th Cir. 1999); Green v.\r\nFrench, 143 F.3d 865, 875-76 (4th Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 119 S.\r\nCt. 844 (1999); Ortiz, 136 F.3d at 168; In re Vial, 115 F.3d at\r\n1197-98.  Further, the restrictions at issue do not, under the\r\ncircumstances of this case, offend separation of powers principles\r\nor the Article III grant of judicial power.  Cf. Green, 143 F.3d at\r\n875-76.\r\nFinally, and perhaps most tellingly, Barrett would not\r\nhave been able to proceed under the pre-AEDPA abuse of the writ\r\ndoctrine.  Therefore, as Barrett implicitly acknowledges,\r\napplication of the AEDPA standards to bar his  2255 petition --\r\nwhich would have been barred pre-AEDPA in any event -- does not\r\nraise any serious constitutional question.  See Davis v. Crabtree,\r\n10 F. Supp. 2d 1136, 1141 (D. Or. 1998) (citing McCleskey, 499 U.S.\r\nat 494-95, and Bousley, 118 S. Ct. at 1611-12); cf. Underwood v.\r\nUnited States, 166 F.3d 84, 88 (2d Cir. 1999) (\"The same\r\nconsiderations that justify denial of relief under  2255 [and make\r\npetitioner fail the pre-AEDPA abuse of the writ test] also require\r\nthat relief be denied under  2241.  This is not a case, such as\r\nTriestman, in which denial of collateral relief could require a\r\nprisoner to serve a sentence for acts that have been ruled not to\r\nconstitute criminal conduct.\"  (citation omitted)); Ortiz, 136 F.3d\r\nat 169 (\"Because Ortiz does not satisfy the standards for\r\nsuccessive  2255 motions in place prior to the enactment of AEDPA,\r\napplying AEDPA to his motion cannot make him any worse off than he\r\nwas prior to its enactment.\").\r\nC.        All Writs Act\r\nFinally, Barrett also argues that he may present his\r\nclaim as a writ of error coram nobis under the All Writs Act.  He\r\nmay not.\r\nBarrett relies on United States v. Morgan, 346 U.S. 502\r\n(1954), in which the Supreme Court stated that  2255 should not\r\n\"be construed to cover the entire field of remedies in the nature\r\nof coram nobis in federal courts.\"  Id. at 510.  However, this\r\nstatement must be read in light of Morgan's broad concern about\r\nwhether any possibility of coram nobis survived the enactment of\r\n2255, a provision which was intended to \"restate[], clarif[y] and\r\nsimplif[y] the procedure in the nature of the ancient writ of error\r\ncoram nobis,\" 28 U.S.C.  2255 Historical and Statutory Notes 1948\r\nEnactment, and the enactment of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\r\n60(b), which \"expressly abolish[ed] the writ of error coram nobis\r\nin civil cases,\"  Morgan, 346 U.S. at 505 n.4.   Although the Court\r\nconcluded that coram nobis was available to the Morgan petitioner,\r\nthe Court did not hold that there are situations in which both\r\n2255 and coram nobis are applicable.  The Morgan petitioner was\r\nno longer \"in custody,\" as is required in order to seek  2255\r\nrelief.  See id. at 503-04.\r\nIndeed, as the Supreme Court noted in rejecting the use\r\nof coram nobis in Carlisle v. United States, 517 U.S. 416 (1996),\r\n\"[t]he All Writs Act is a residual source of authority to issue\r\nwrits that are not otherwise covered by statute.  Where a statute\r\nspecifically addresses the particular issue at hand, it is that\r\nauthority, and not the All Writs Act, that is controlling.\"  Id. at\r\n428-29 (quoting Pennsylvania Bureau of Correction v. United States\r\nMarshals Serv., 474 U.S. 34, 43 (1985)) (internal quotation marks\r\nomitted); see also Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Markarian, 114 F.3d\r\n346, 350 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"The All Writs Act does not authorize\r\n[federal courts] to issue ad hoc writs whenever compliance with\r\nstatutory procedures appears inconvenient or less appropriate.\" \r\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).\r\nBarrett asserts that no statute, \"other than the Jencks\r\nAct and statutory provisions governing direct appeals,\"\r\nspecifically addresses the particular issue at hand in his case. \r\nHowever,  2255 is applicable to Barrett, and the statute\r\nspecifically addresses this situation by barring Barrett's second\r\n2255 petition.  See, e.g., United States v. Brown, 117 F.3d 471,\r\n475 (11th Cir. 1997); United States v. Kindle, 88 F.3d 535, 536\r\n(8th Cir. 1996) (per curiam). \r\nThat  2255 does not provide Barrett with a means to\r\nobtain the relief he seeks does not mean that it is not a\r\n\"controlling\" authority for the purposes of determining whether the\r\nAll Writs Act applies.  The fact that  2255 bars his second\r\npetition at its inception does not make that provision any less\r\ncontrolling.  In Carlisle itself, the Court forbade the use of\r\ncoram nobis to circumvent Rule 29, Fed. R. Civ. P., despite the\r\nfact that application of that rule meant that the defendant's\r\nmotion for a judgment of acquittal was untimely and should have\r\nbeen rejected immediately by the district court without any\r\nconsideration of the merits or any grant of relief.  See Carlisle,\r\n517 U.S. at 428-29, 433; see also Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., 114 F.3d\r\nat 350 (finding use of the All Writs Act inappropriate where Rule\r\n69(a) had been consistently interpreted to block plaintiff's\r\nclaim); Ex parte Farrell, 189 F.2d 540, 545 (1st Cir. 1951) (\"Where\r\nthe appeal statutes establish the conditions of appellate review\r\n[such as timeliness], an appellate court cannot rightly exercise\r\nits authority to issue a writ under the 'all writs' section, 28\r\nU.S.C.  1651, the only effect of which would be to avoid those\r\nconditions and thwart the congressional policy.  For us to grab\r\nhold of the present case under 28 U.S.C.  1651 would not be in aid\r\nof our appellate jurisdiction . . . , but would be a palpable\r\nevasion of the statutory conditions which Congress has seen fit to\r\nimpose . . . .\").  The writ of coram nobis may not be used to\r\ncircumvent the clear congressional directive embodied in the\r\n\"second or successive\" provisions of  2255, which are themselves\r\na sort of \"timeliness\" requirement.  See, e.g., United States v.\r\nDamiano, No. CRIM. 90-00488-01, 1997 WL 539704, at *2 (E.D. Pa.\r\nAug. 6, 1997) (\"[T]he [AEDPA] limits the ability of a petitioner to\r\nobtain relief in later Section 2255 motions and encourages all\r\npetitioners to include all of their claims of error in their first\r\nmotion.  For this reason, given the broad purpose of the Act, it\r\nwould be astounding if [the \"second or successive\" restrictions]\r\ncould be rendered wholly ineffective by the simple ruse of labeling\r\nfuture  2255 motions as petitions for writs of coram nobis.\");\r\nBennett v. United States, No. 87 CR 874, 1997 WL 285987, at *2\r\n(N.D. Ill. May 22, 1997) (\"[Section] 2255 is not unavailable to\r\n[petitioner]; it just offers him no relief from his sentence.\");\r\nsee also, e.g., United States v. Bailey, No. 97 C 7665, 94 CR 481,\r\n1997 WL 757869, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 26, 1997) (applying the same\r\nrule in a case involving the AEDPA statute of limitations).\r\nIt may be that there are situations in which  2255 is\r\nnot \"controlling\" despite the fact that the petitioner remains in\r\ncustody -- for instance, where  2255 is \"inadequate or\r\nineffective.\"  See Triestman, 124 F.3d at 380 n.24; see also United\r\nStates v. Ransom, 985 F. Supp. 1017, 1019 (D. Kan. 1997).  But we\r\nhave no cause to explore those potential situations in this case,\r\nsince  2255 is not \"inadequate or ineffective\" and so plainly\r\n\"specifically addresses\" the situation that we face.  Carlisle,\r\n517 U.S. at 429 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also\r\nDavenport, 147 F.3d at 608 (\"[I]f Congress has forbidden federal\r\nprisoners to proceed under 2241 even when 2255 is closed to them[,]\r\nthen it would be senseless to suppose that Congress permitted them\r\nto pass through the closed door simply by changing the number 2241\r\nto 1651 on their motions.\").\r\nThe scope of relief obtainable under the All Writs Act is\r\nnarrowed when a statute governing a particular issue is enacted. \r\nHere  2255, as amended by AEDPA, governs.  There is no contention\r\nthat the AEDPA provisions themselves have somehow amended the All\r\nWrits Act.  We conclude merely that Barrett is not permitted to\r\nproceed with a  1651 petition under the circumstances of this\r\ncase.  For the reasons already discussed, barring Barrett's\r\npetition does not present any constitutional difficulties.\r\n                     V\r\nWe have considered Barrett's remaining arguments; they\r\nare without merit.  See United States v. Bongiorno, 106 F.3d 1027,\r\n1034 (1st Cir. 1997) (explaining that this court has \"steadfastly\r\ndeemed waived issues raised on appeal in a perfunctory manner, not\r\naccompanied by developed argumentation\").  Despite Barrett's\r\nliberal invocation of federal constitutional principles, this case\r\nis in the end simply an example of a garden-variety abuse of the\r\nwrit -- an abuse that would have been forbidden prior to the\r\nenactment of AEDPA and is most certainly barred by AEDPA's more\r\nstringent provisions.  See Pratt, 129 F.3d at 63 (\"[Petitioner]\r\nfailed to marshal all his claims of error in his first section 2255\r\npetition, and he must now pay the piper.  AEDPA governs here, and,\r\non the facts of this case, AEDPA's clear language prohibits\r\n[petitioner] from rectifying his omission by means of a second\r\npetition.\"); cf. Calderon, 118 S. Ct. at 1502; McCleskey, 499 U.S.\r\nat 491-93.\r\nThe lessons of this case for the criminal defense bar are\r\nclear.  A first petition for post-conviction relief under  2255\r\nshould raise all available claims.  Informal reference to a new\r\nclaim in a reply brief will not suffice to raise a claim if the\r\ndistrict court does not address that claim in its order.  Failure\r\nto raise an available claim does not permit an end-run around the\r\nrequirements of  2255 by resort to  2241 or the All Writs Act. \r\nThere is only one bite at the post-conviction apple unless a second\r\nor successive petition can show one of two things:  a new rule of\r\nconstitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review\r\nby the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable, or newly\r\ndiscovered evidence sufficient to establish by clear and convincing\r\nevidence, on the whole record, that no reasonable factfinder would\r\nhave returned a guilty verdict.  A claim of actual innocence --\r\ndefined as factual innocence, not mere legal insufficiency -- will\r\nhave a mechanism for review.\r\nWe therefore affirm the district court's dismissal of\r\nBarrett's petition.  Barrett's appeal is also treated concurrently\r\nas a request for leave to file a second or successive habeas\r\npetition and that request is denied.\n",

A federal prisoner/parolee,\r\nconvicted of a serious crime committed twenty-five years ago, seeks\r\nto avoid the restrictions imposed by Congress in 1996 on successive\r\npetitions for post-conviction relief and argues that it is illegal\r\nand unconstitutional to deny him the ability to raise an argument\r\nabout the validity of his conviction that he could have raised\r\nproperly in 1990.  He has not shown that he is actually innocent\r\nand no claims of constitutional dimension are raised on these\r\nfacts.  Under the various applicable gatekeeping mechanisms, which\r\naugment society's interests in finality of criminal convictions\r\nwhere there has been no miscarriage of justice, he has not\r\nsatisfied the preconditions in 28 U.S.C.  2255, as amended by the\r\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\"AEDPA\"), that would\r\nallow him to have the merits of his claim reviewed.  He cannot\r\nevade the restrictions of  2255 by resort to the habeas statute,\r\n28 U.S.C.  2241, or the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C.  1651. \r\nResolution of this case involves exploration of the various\r\nstatutes and legal doctrines authorizing limited review of claims\r\nfor post-conviction relief.  Our conclusion is that while there are\r\nvery rare circumstances in which review may exist even if the\r\nrequirements of  2255 have not been met, this case presents none\r\nof those circumstances.\r\nJames Barrett was convicted of a bank robbery in federal\r\ncourt in 1984.  He brought an unsuccessful appeal in 1984 and an\r\nunsuccessful  2255 petition in 1990, and now seeks to bring\r\nanother petition attacking his conviction.  The primary legal\r\nquestions presented in this case are whether the petition before us\r\nis a \"second or successive\"  2255 petition, 28 U.S.C.  2255, and\r\nwhether Barrett may use  2241 or  1651 to bring a claim that\r\nwould otherwise be barred under  2255 and 28 U.S.C.  2244.  Each\r\nof these raises subsidiary questions; several are questions of\r\nfirst impression for this circuit.\r\n                     I\r\nIn 1975, three armed men wearing ski masks robbed a bank\r\nin Portland, Maine.  In 1984, James Barrett was tried for that\r\nrobbery.  Barrett denied any involvement; the chief prosecution\r\nwitness, Joseph Aceto, said Barrett did participate in the robbery. \r\nThe jury believed Aceto and not Barrett.  Barrett was convicted and\r\nsentenced to twenty years of imprisonment.  Barrett promptly filed\r\npost-trial motions for acquittal and a new trial, which the\r\ndistrict court denied.

In a reply brief, Barrett tried to characterize the failure\r\nto disclose the transcript as a violation of the Jencks Act, 18\r\nU.S.C.  3500, as well as a Brady violation.  The district court\r\ndismissed the petition without addressing the belated and informal\r\nJencks Act claim.  See Barrett v.

Cutting through the\r\nprocedural morass presented, we find three essential questions for\r\nus to resolve:\r\n1.  Does Barrett present a \"second or successive\"  2255\r\npetition, as that term is defined under the 1996 AEDPA amendments,\r\nand, if so, is his petition barred because it does not meet AEDPA's\r\ngatekeeper requirements?\r\n2.  Does Barrett's claim fall within the savings clause\r\nof  2255, which permits a petitioner to seek relief under  2241\r\nif  2255 is \"inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his\r\ndetention\"?\r\n3.  Does the All Writs Act nonetheless provide Barrett\r\nwith a vehicle for raising his Jencks Act claim?\r\nThe answer to the first question is yes, and the answer\r\nto the second and third questions is no.  We affirm the dismissal\r\nof Barrett's petition.\r\n                     II\r\nWe describe in detail the travel of the issues to this\r\ncourt.  In June of 1990, Barrett filed a pro se petition under\r\n2555 requesting that his sentence be vacated or set aside.  The\r\ncourt appointed counsel, different counsel than in the instant\r\npetition.  Five months after Barrett's petition was first filed, he\r\nfiled an amended habeas petition, with counsel's assistance,\r\nalleging that the government had failed to disclose certain\r\nevidence.  Among that undisclosed evidence was a transcript of an\r\ninterview conducted in Arkansas by an FBI agent with Aceto, the\r\nchief prosecution witness.  This interview took place in the\r\npresence of the prosecuting Assistant U.S. Attorney (\"AUSA\") on\r\nJanuary 26, 1984, about two months before Barrett's trial.  Before\r\nthe trial, the government promised to disclose all prior statements\r\nby Aceto and provided Barrett with a redacted summary of the\r\ninterview on FBI Form 302.  But the government did not provide a\r\ncopy of the transcript, and that failure underlies the case before\r\nus.\r\nBarrett's 1990 amended  2255 petition alleged that the\r\nfailure to provide the interview transcript violated Brady.  On\r\nJanuary 4, 1991, the government responded to the amended petition;\r\nincluded in its response was an affidavit from the AUSA who was\r\npresent at the interview -- a different AUSA than represents the\r\ngovernment before us now.  The AUSA stated that the interview was\r\nconducted to assist the FBI in its investigation of two other\r\nsuspected participants in the bank robbery, who were fugitives at\r\nthe time and were considered extremely dangerous.  According to the\r\nAUSA, since security concerns were very high he \"never considered\r\nthe sensitive investigative information in the transcript as\r\ndiscoverable.\"\r\nOn February 19, 1991, Barrett filed \"Plaintiff's Motion\r\nfor Leave to File a Brief Reply Memorandum,\" which asserted that\r\n\"several legal arguments and factual assertions raised by the\r\ngovernment . . . require a response from plaintiff.\"  After the\r\ndistrict court granted this motion, Barrett filed a reply brief on\r\nFebruary 22, 1991; this brief raised for the first time a claim\r\nthat the failure to disclose the interview transcript violated the\r\nJencks Act.  Barrett did not seek to amend his  2255 petition to\r\nadd this claim, and the government did not respond to it.\r\nOn April 30, 1991, the district court dismissed the\r\namended petition without mentioning the Jencks Act claim.  The\r\ncourt did, however, extensively discuss the Arkansas interview\r\ntranscript in order to determine whether a constitutional violation\r\nhad occurred under Brady.  See Barrett, 763 F. Supp. at 662-63.  In\r\narguing to the district court that the government's failure to\r\nproduce the transcript made a constitutional difference, Barrett\r\nraised several specific purposes for which he would have used the\r\ntranscript to impeach Aceto.  See id. at 662.  Applying the test\r\nset forth in United States v. Bagley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111514\"><a href=\"/opinion/111514/united-states-v-bagley/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">667</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1985), which\r\nstates that \"a constitutional error occurs, and the conviction must\r\nbe reversed, only if the evidence is material in the sense that its\r\nsuppression undermines confidence in the outcome of the trial,\" id.\r\nat 678, the court addressed each of these purposes and concluded,\r\nafter careful analysis, that its \"confidence in the outcome of the\r\ntrial [was] not diminished in any respect,\" Barrett, 763 F. Supp.\r\nat 662-63.  The court noted that \"Aceto was thoroughly impeached by\r\nfar more substantial means:  his mental illness, inconsistencies\r\nbetween trial and previous testimony, his prior criminal behavior,\r\nand his agreement with the government.  Yet the jury believed him.\" \r\nBarrett, 763 F. Supp. at 663 (footnote omitted).\r\nAfter the district court issued this opinion, Barrett's\r\ncounsel filed an unsigned and undated motion for reconsideration on\r\nthe ground that the Jencks Act claim had not been addressed.  That\r\nmotion was stricken on June 6, 1991 for failure to comply with\r\nvarious applicable rules requiring counsel's signature.  Two later\r\nmotions for reconsideration based on the same issue were filed and\r\ndenied.\r\nOn appeal to this court from the denial of the  2255\r\npetition, Barrett argued both the Jencks Act claim arising from the\r\nfailure to disclose the interview transcript and various Brady\r\nclaims.  This court affirmed the dismissal of the Brady claims. \r\nSee Barrett, 965 F.2d at 1188-92 &amp; n.15.  As to the Jencks Act\r\nclaim, this court held that the reply brief that first raised the\r\nclaim to the district court was not properly characterized as a\r\n\"traverse\"; that the motions to reconsider were untimely under\r\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e); and that, if the motions for\r\nreconsideration were considered Rule 60 motions, \"petitioner would\r\nfare no better, since the district court orders denying the motions\r\nwere never appealed.\"  Id. at 1187-88 &amp; n.3.  Accordingly, this\r\ncourt stated, \"as a practical matter, petitioner's failure to raise\r\nthe Jencks Act claim in a timely manner below preclude[d] effective\r\nappellate review on the merits.\"  Id. at 1188.\r\nThis court also suggested, \"without deciding,\" several\r\nconcerns about any future attempts by Barrett to raise the Jencks\r\nAct claim.  First, we expressed doubts about the viability of such\r\na claim under  2255, given \"the recognized rule that\r\nnonconstitutional claims may not be presented in a section 2255\r\nproceeding unless the claimed error of law [represents] a\r\nfundamental defect which inherently results in a complete\r\nmiscarriage of justice.\"  Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). \r\nSecond, we stated that a future attempt to raise the Jencks Act\r\nclaim would be \"a successive  2255 petition\" subject to \"abuse of\r\nthe writ\" analysis.  Id. at 1188 n.7 (citing McCleskey v. Zant, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112573\"><a href=\"/opinion/112573/mccleskey-v-zant/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1991)).\r\nThe opinion of this court affirming the denial of the\r\n2255 petition was issued on June 8, 1992.  Barrett did nothing to\r\npursue his Jencks Act claim for four years.  On April 24, 1996,\r\nAEDPA became effective.  Barrett filed his current petition later\r\nin 1996.  AEDPA changed both the procedure for obtaining permission\r\nto bring a \"second or successive\"  2555 petition and the\r\nsubstantive standards that must be met to obtain such permission.\r\n                    III\r\nAEDPA Standards\r\nUnder AEDPA, a prisoner may file a second or successive\r\n2255 petition only if the court of appeals first certifies that\r\nthe petition is based on either:\r\n(1) newly discovered evidence that, if proven and viewed in\r\nlight of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to\r\nestablish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable\r\nfactfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense;\r\nor\r\n(2) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to\r\ncases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was\r\npreviously unavailable.\r\n\n28 U.S.C.  2255 (cross-referencing to  2244 certification\r\nrequirements); see also id.  2244(b)(3)(A) (requiring\r\nauthorization by the court of appeals \"[b]efore a second or\r\nsuccessive application . . . is filed in the district court\");\r\nFirst Cir.

See 28 U.S.C.  2253(c)(1) (\"Unless a circuit justice or\r\njudge issues a certificate of appealability, an appeal may not be\r\ntaken to the court of appeals from . . . the final order in a\r\nproceeding under section 2255.\"); id.  2253(c)(2)-(3) (\"A\r\ncertificate of appealability may issue . . . only if the applicant\r\nhas made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional\r\nright. . . .

In the late\r\nsummer of 1996, Barrett petitioned \"to set aside judgment of\r\nconviction and for such other and further relief as this Court may\r\ndeem appropriate,\" styling his petition as brought pursuant to 28\r\nU.S.C.  1651, 2241, 2255, and Article I,  9, clause 2 of the\r\nConstitution.  The magistrate judge issued an order returning the\r\npetition on the ground that it was a \"second or successive\"  2255\r\npetition that had not been pre-cleared by the court of appeals; the\r\ndistrict court, upon reviewing Barrett's objections, affirmed. \r\nBarrett appealed.  After proceedings not here relevant, the\r\ndistrict court treated the notice of appeal as a request for a COA\r\nand certified the following issue:\r\nWhether, in the circumstances of this case, the application of\r\nthe provisions of the [AEDPA], which bar the filing of\r\nsuccessive petitions under 28 U.S.C.  2255 absent an order of\r\nthe Court of Appeals authorizing the District Court to\r\nconsider the petition, so as to bar the filing of the petition\r\nherein, conflicts impermissibly with the All Writs Act, 28\r\nU.S.C.  1651, to deny Petitioner his federally protected\r\nrights of equal protection of the laws and of due process of\r\nlaw under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\nBarrett then filed an application for a COA in this court; we\r\nstated that the appeal could proceed to briefing \"[i]n view of this\r\ncourt's recent decision [in Grant-Chase] concluding that when a\r\ndistrict court has granted a [COA] on an issue, an appellant is not\r\nrequired to obtain a further certificate from this court with\r\nrespect to that issue.\"\r\nGiven this procedural history, this court has\r\njurisdiction to consider all three essential issues, outlined\r\nabove, necessary to resolve Barrett's appeal.  As to Barrett's\r\nclaim pursuant to  2255, our authority to consider the necessary\r\nissues is similar to the Pratt court's.  To the extent that Barrett\r\ncontends that AEDPA is not applicable to his claim, the district\r\ncourt's order is appealable and a COA has issued regarding the\r\npropriety of applying AEDPA.  See Pratt, 129 F.3d at 57-58; see\r\nalso In re Davenport, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"755435\"><a href=\"/opinion/755435/in-re-james-davenport-and-sherman-nichols/\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">605</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 607 (7th Cir. 1998).  To the\r\nextent that there is a question regarding the applicability of the\r\n\"second or successive\" provisions of AEDPA, we exercise our\r\ndiscretion to construe this appeal as an application to us for pre-\r\nclearance, and no COA is necessary.  See Pratt, 129 F.3d at 58;\r\nPease v. Klinger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"741834\"><a href=\"/opinion/741834/jb-pease-v-ken-klinger-attorney-general-of-the-state-of-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">763</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 764 (10th Cir. 1997) (per curiam). \r\nFinally, as to Barrett's claim that he should have been allowed to\r\nproceed in the district court pursuant to  2241 or  1651, the COA\r\nand pre-clearance requirements are not directly applicable.  See\r\nDavenport, 147 F.3d at 607;  Valona v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"752145\"><a href=\"/opinion/752145/james-j-valona-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">693</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n694 (7th Cir. 1998); Triestman v.

Nov. 20, 1998). \r\nBarrett's underlying substantive claim under the Jencks Act is\r\ntherefore before us only to the extent that the nature of that\r\nclaim is relevant to the determination of whether there is a means\r\navailable for asserting it.\r\n                     IV\r\nA.        \"Second or Successive\" Petition Under  2255\r\nWe begin by considering Barrett's claim under  2255.  It\r\nis clear that this provision is facially applicable to his\r\npetition:  he challenges the validity of his conviction; he is \"in\r\ncustody\"; his request for relief was made to the federal court\r\nthat sentenced him; and he himself invoked  2255 as a basis for\r\njurisdiction.  See Valona, 138 F.3d at 694-95.  The issue becomes\r\nhow his petition is affected by the \"second or successive\"\r\nrequirements applicable to  2255 petitions.  Barrett makes three\r\ngeneral arguments.  He says that this is really a first petition. \r\nEven if not technically a first petition, he says it should be\r\ntreated as one because he attempted to raise the Jencks Act claim\r\nin his first petition.  He also suggests that application of the\r\n\"second or successive\" requirements would be impermissibly\r\nretroactive and would raise constitutional problems.\r\nMeaning of \"Second or Successive\" and the Abuse of the Writ\r\nDoctrine\r\nAs Barrett points out, AEDPA leaves the phrase \"second or\r\nsuccessive\" undefined.  See Galtieri v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"747589\"><a href=\"/opinion/747589/gennaro-galtieri-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 35 (2d Cir. 1997) (\"[W]hen is a petition 'second or successive'\r\nwithin the meaning of . . . [AEDPA?]  Unfortunately, as with many\r\nlegal questions, the answer is: 'It depends.'\").  However, there is\r\nsignificant guidance as to whether Barrett's most recent petition\r\nfalls within the scope of AEDPA's \"second or successive\"\r\nrestrictions.  As an initial matter, courts construing the phrase\r\nhave generally applied pre-AEDPA abuse of the writ decisions.  See\r\nEsposito v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751219\"><a href=\"/opinion/751219/anthony-esposito-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 113 (2d Cir. 1997) (per\r\ncuriam); Pratt, 129 F.3d at 60; Reeves v.

As was true pre-AEDPA under\r\nthe abuse of the writ doctrine, \"a numerically second petition is\r\nnot 'second or successive' if it attacks a different criminal\r\njudgment or if the earlier petition terminated without a judgment\r\non the merits.\"  Pratt, 129 F.3d at 60; see also Esposito, 135 F.3d\r\nat 113.\r\nFurther definition is given in a series of post-AEDPA\r\ndecisions in this court and other courts of appeals.  A petition is\r\nnot \"second or successive\" when a state petitioner whose first\r\npetition was dismissed for failure to exhaust state remedies brings\r\na new petition based on exhausted claims.

These categories also\r\ndo not apply to Barrett.\r\nBarrett rather tries to build on the Supreme Court's\r\nrecent interpretation of the phrase \"second or successive\" in\r\nStewart v. Martinez-Villareal, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118206\"><a href=\"/opinion/118206/stewart-v-martinez-villareal/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1618</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1998).  In Stewart,\r\nthe Supreme Court held that a petition was not second or successive\r\nwithin the meaning of the AEDPA state habeas provisions when the\r\nclaim at issue had been raised in a previous petition but dismissed\r\nby the district court as premature and unripe (although the\r\ndistrict court had resolved the ripe claims presented in the first\r\npetition on their merits).\r\n[The most recent petition] may have been the second time that\r\nrespondent had asked the federal courts to provide relief on\r\nhis Ford claim, but this does not mean that there were two\r\nseparate applications, the second of which was necessarily\r\nsubject to [the second or successive provision].  There was\r\nonly one application for habeas relief, and the District Court\r\nruled (or should have ruled) on each claim at the time it\r\nbecame ripe.  Respondent was entitled to an adjudication of\r\nall of the claims presented in his earlier, undoubtedly\r\nreviewable, application for federal habeas relief.\r\nId. at 1621.  The Supreme Court compared the case before it to the\r\ncases involving dismissals for nonexhaustion, and explained that\r\n\"[t]o hold otherwise would mean that a dismissal of a first habeas\r\npetition for technical procedural reasons would bar the prisoner\r\nfrom ever obtaining federal habeas review.\"  Id. at 1622 (noting\r\nthat the Ford claim could not be decided at the time it was first\r\npresented because petitioner's \"execution was not imminent\").\r\nThe rationale of the Stewart decision does not help\r\nBarrett, but reinforces that his claim does not fall within an\r\nexception to the \"second or successive\" rule.   Part of the Stewart\r\nCourt's rationale for finding that the previously premature claims\r\nwere not second or successive was that those claims \"would not be\r\nbarred under any form of res judicata.\"  Id.  The core of the AEDPA\r\nrestrictions on second or successive  2255 petitions is related to\r\nthe longstanding judicial and statutory restrictions embodied in\r\nthe form of res judicata known as the \"abuse of the writ\" doctrine. \r\nAs the Supreme Court noted in Felker v. Turpin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118058\"><a href=\"/opinion/118058/felker-v-turpin/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">651</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\r\n(1996), as to similar restrictions on  2254 petitions, \"[t]he new\r\nrestrictions on successive petitions constitute a modified res\r\njudicata rule, a restraint on what is called in habeas corpus\r\npractice 'abuse of the writ.'\"  Id. at 664; see also O'Connor, 133\r\nF.3d at 550 (stating that \"the idea . . . is that a prisoner is\r\nentitled to one, but only one, full and fair opportunity to wage a\r\ncollateral attack\").\r\nCases in which numerically second petitions have not been\r\ntreated as \"second or successive\" can be understood as describing\r\nfactual scenarios in which the application of a modified res\r\njudicata rule would not make sense.  See Vancleave v. Norris, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"756539\"><a href=\"/opinion/756539/james-d-vancleave-v-larry-norris-director-arkansas-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">926</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 928 (8th Cir. 1998) (stating that Stewart recognizes\r\n\"that some types of 'second' petitions do not implicate the\r\njudicially developed abuse-of-the-writ principles that were the\r\nbasis for AEDPA's statutory restrictions\"); Camarano, 98 F.3d at\r\n46-47 (analogizing to civil claim preclusion doctrine); 2 Liebman\r\n&amp; Hertz, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure  28.3a, at\r\n275 (2d ed. Supp. 1997) (\"Applying the no-second-bite rule makes no\r\nsense when a prior petition gave the prisoner what amounts to no\r\nbite at the apple -- because the prior petition involved a\r\ndifferent apple, because no bite was taken when the apple\r\npreviously was before the court, or because no bite could have been\r\ntaken at that time because the claim had not yet come into\r\nexistence or would not have been cognizable at the time of the\r\nearlier petition.\"  (emphasis in original)); see also id.  28.3b,\r\nat 1163-71 (3d ed. 1998).  We do not purport to define the full\r\nscope of the phrase \"second or successive.\"  However, as a general\r\nmatter, if a petition falls under the modified res judicata rule\r\nknown as the abuse of the writ doctrine -- because, for example, it\r\nraises a claim that could have been properly raised and decided in\r\na previous  2255 petition -- it also falls within the definition\r\nof \"second or successive.\"  Once the petition is defined as\r\n\"second or successive,\" review occurs only if certain requirements\r\nare met.\r\nApplication to Barrett's 1996 Petition\r\nApplying these principles, we conclude that Barrett's\r\ncurrent petition is a \"second or successive\" one.  This petition\r\ndoes not fit into any of the exceptions described above:  Barrett's\r\n1990 petition, which was undisputedly brought pursuant to  2255,\r\nwas dismissed on the merits (although the Jencks Act claim was not\r\nconsidered); his current petition challenges the same judgment that\r\nwas challenged in his 1990 petition; and there has been no new\r\njudgment or amendment of sentence.  See Thomas v.\r\nSuperintendent/Woodbourne Corr. Facility, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751618\"><a href=\"/opinion/751618/elery-thomas-v-superintendentwoodbourne-corr-facility/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">227</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 229-30 (2d\r\nCir. 1997) (per curiam). \r\nFurther, there is no question that Barrett's Jencks Act\r\nclaim was available and, unlike the Ford claim at issue in Stewart,\r\ncould have been both brought and adjudicated at the time of the\r\nfirst petition.  Barrett had the transcript of the interview with\r\nAceto at the time he brought the Brady claim in the 1990 petition. \r\nAlthough Barrett leans heavily on the contention that his Jencks\r\nAct claim was not available until after the filing of the AUSA's\r\naffidavit, which he characterizes as an admission of bad faith, it\r\ncannot be that a Jencks Act claim asserting bad faith is\r\nunavailable until there has been a direct admission from the\r\nprosecutor -- a circumstance that is surely a rare one.  Assuming\r\nthat the existence of bad faith was necessary in order to raise the\r\nclaim, Barrett had in front of him various facts from which he\r\ncould have marshaled a reasonable argument to that effect.  Cf.\r\nMcCleskey v. Zant, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112573\"><a href=\"/opinion/112573/mccleskey-v-zant/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 498-500 (1991) (explaining that\r\n\"cause\" for the failure to raise a claim is not established if\r\n\"petitioner possessed . . . a sufficient basis to allege a claim in\r\nthe first petition and pursue the matter through the habeas\r\nprocess\" (citing  2254 provisions on discovery, expansion of the\r\nrecord, and evidentiary hearing)).  Indeed, Barrett's own brief to\r\nus on this appeal seems to construct an argument -- that total\r\nsuppression is equivalent to willful destruction, which is\r\nequivalent to an \"elect[ion] not to comply\" with the Act, 18 U.S.C.\r\n3500(d) -- that does not rely on any government admissions.  See\r\nAppellant's Brief at 26-27.\r\nBarrett now asserts that he should be excused from his\r\nfailure to raise the Jencks Act claim in his first petition\r\nbecause, he says, filing such a claim prior to the submission of\r\nthe AUSA's affidavit would amount to a violation of Rule 11.  That\r\nis not so.  See Fed. R. Civ.

The situation presented here is\r\ntherefore equivalent to the common situation in which a petitioner\r\nwho has failed to raise an available claim in his first petition\r\nattempts to raise that claim in a later petition.  That situation\r\nclearly falls within the \"second or successive\" rule, even though\r\nthe claim has never been adjudicated on the merits.  See Pratt, 129\r\nF.3d at 62 (\"As a general rule, a prisoner who had both the\r\nincentive and the ability to raise a particular claim in his first\r\npetition for post-conviction relief, but declined to assert it,\r\ncannot raise it the second time around.\"); see also Corrao v.\r\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757029\"><a href=\"/opinion/757029/joseph-corrao-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 191 (2d Cir. 1998) (\"Generally, a\r\n2255 petition is 'second or successive' if a prior  2255\r\npetition, raising claims regarding the same conviction or sentence,\r\nhas been decided on the merits.  This remains true even if the\r\nlatter petition purports to raise new claims.\"  (citation\r\nomitted)).\r\n          As we stated in Pratt, \r\nThe requirement that all available claims be presented in a\r\nprisoner's first habeas petition is consistent not only with\r\nthe spirit of AEDPA's restrictions on second and successive\r\nhabeas petitions, but also with the preexisting abuse of the\r\nwrit principle.  The requirement serves the singularly\r\nsalutary purpose of forcing federal habeas petitioners to\r\nthink through all potential post-conviction claims and to\r\nconsolidate them for a unitary presentation to the district\r\ncourt.  This exercise advances the cause of judicial\r\nefficiency and further justifies barring [petitioner]'s second\r\npetition.\r\n\nPratt, 129 F.3d at 61.  Accordingly, Barrett's  2255 petition is\r\n\"second or successive\" within the meaning of AEDPA -- the result we\r\nsuggested in our previous, pre-AEDPA decision in this case.  See\r\nBarrett, 965 F.2d at 1188 n.7.\r\nThe Retroactivity Argument and the Pre-AEDPA Test\r\nBarrett contends that, even if we construe his petition\r\nas a \"second or successive\"  2255 petition, he meets the\r\nrequirements for proceeding in the district court because the\r\nrestrictions in AEDPA on such petitions should not apply to him. \r\nDespite the instruction in Lindh v.

And it\r\nhas already been determined, through Barrett's prior petition, that\r\nthe evidence the government failed to produce was not material in\r\na constitutional sense -- that is, that it would not raise a\r\nreasonable probability of a different outcome.

Under these AEDPA restrictions, of course, we\r\nreach the same conclusion that we reached under McCleskey.  Barrett\r\nhas not argued that he satisfies either of the two AEDPA\r\npreconditions for filing a second or successive  2255 petition,\r\nand he patently does not.  Therefore, we turn to whether this case\r\nfits within the savings clause of  2255.\r\nB.        The Savings Clause in  2255: \"Inadequate or Ineffective\" \r\nRemedy\r\nSince Barrett may not proceed with his  2255 petition,\r\nwe turn to his argument that the savings clause of  2255 permits\r\nhim to proceed under  2241 as a means of seeking relief.  See 28\r\nU.S.C.  2241 (stating that \"[w]rits of habeas corpus may be\r\ngranted by the Supreme Court, any justice thereof, the district\r\ncourts and any circuit judge within their respective jurisdictions\"\r\nunder specified circumstances).\r\nWe begin with the limitation on the use of  2241\r\npetitions by federal prisoners that is set forth in  2255:  \r\nAn application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a\r\nprisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion\r\npursuant to [ 2255], shall not be entertained if it appears\r\nthat the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion,\r\nto the court which sentenced him, or that such court has\r\ndenied him relief, unless it also appears that the remedy by\r\nmotion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of\r\nhis detention.\r\n\nThis circuit has not previously defined the phrase \"inadequate or\r\nineffective\" or analyzed its scope.\r\nA petition under  2255 cannot become \"inadequate or\r\nineffective,\" thus permitting the use of  2241, merely because a\r\npetitioner cannot meet the AEDPA \"second or successive\"\r\nrequirements.  Such a result would make Congress's AEDPA amendment\r\nof  2255 a meaningless gesture.  See, e.g., In re Davenport, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"755435\"><a href=\"/opinion/755435/in-re-james-davenport-and-sherman-nichols/\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">605</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 608 (7th Cir. 1998) (\"Congress did not change [the\r\n\"inadequate or ineffective\"] language when in the Antiterrorism Act\r\nit imposed limitations on the filing of successive 2255 motions. \r\nThe retention of the old language opens the way to the argument\r\nthat when the new limitations prevent the prisoner from obtaining\r\nrelief under 2255, his remedy under that section is inadequate and\r\nhe may turn to 2241.

In three recent cases, the\r\nSeventh, Third, and Second Circuits have addressed the meaning of\r\nthe \"inadequate or ineffective\" language and given it content.  All\r\nthree cases involved a factual scenario in which the petitioner's\r\nfirst  2255 petition had been resolved prior to the Supreme\r\nCourt's decision in Bailey v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117985\"><a href=\"/opinion/117985/bailey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995).\r\nUnder Bailey's statutory interpretation, actions for which the\r\npetitioner had been convicted were in fact not criminal at all, but\r\nthe petitioner's second petition, which raised a Bailey claim, was\r\nbarred by the AEDPA \"second or successive\" rules.\r\nIn interpreting the savings clause, the Seventh Circuit\r\nin Davenport looked to the essential function of habeas corpus.  It\r\ncharacterized that function as \"giv[ing] a prisoner a reasonable\r\nopportunity to obtain a reliable judicial determination of the\r\nfundamental legality of his conviction and sentence.\"  Davenport,\r\n147 F.3d at 609.  The court stated that a prisoner who \"had a\r\nchance to raise the question\" at issue in his appeal and his first\r\n2255 petition had already had his reasonable opportunity, and did\r\nnot need another \"procedural shot at getting his sentence vacated.\" \r\nId. at 609-10 (\"Society . . . is unwilling to expend indefinitely\r\nlarge judicial resources on repeated testing of the accuracy of a\r\ndetermination of guilt.\").  However, the court concluded that\r\n2241 was available where a Bailey claim simply could not have\r\nbeen presented on direct appeal or in a first petition, stating\r\nthat \"[a] procedure for postconviction relief can fairly be termed\r\ninadequate when it is so configured as to deny a convicted\r\ndefendant any opportunity for judicial rectification of so\r\nfundamental a defect in his conviction as having been imprisoned\r\nfor a nonexistent offense.\"  Id. at 611; see also id. (\"A federal\r\nprisoner should be permitted to seek habeas corpus only if he had\r\nno reasonable opportunity to obtain earlier judicial correction of\r\na fundamental defect in his conviction or sentence because the law\r\nchanged after his first 2255 motion.\").\r\nThe Seventh Circuit's holding in Davenport is very\r\nsimilar to the Third Circuit's holding in Dorsainvil that  2241\r\nrelief is available in the \"unusual circumstance\" in which\r\napplication of the AEDPA \"second or successive\" limitations would\r\nresult in a \"complete miscarriage of justice.\"  Dorsainvil, 119\r\nF.3d at 251 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Like Davenport,\r\nDorsainvil stressed that the petitioner had not had an earlier\r\nopportunity to raise his Bailey claim; the court also pointed out\r\nthat \"[t]he government has not suggested that Dorsainvil has abused\r\nthe writ, the principal situation that the AEDPA was intended to\r\neliminate.\"  Id.  Further, the court emphasized that its holding\r\nwas a \"narrow one\" and was not intended to interfere with\r\napplication of the  2255 gatekeeping provisions.  See id. at 251-\r\n52 (\"[A]llowing someone in Dorsainvil's unusual position -- that of\r\na prisoner who had no earlier opportunity to challenge his\r\nconviction for a crime that an intervening change in substantive\r\nlaw may negate, even when the government concedes that such a\r\nchange should be applied retroactively -- is hardly likely to\r\nundermine the gatekeeping provisions of  2255.\").\r\nDavenport and Dorsainvil are also similar to, but\r\ndistinct from, the Second Circuit's holding in Triestman that a\r\nfederal prisoner can seek  2241 habeas corpus in \"the set of cases\r\nin which the petitioner cannot, for whatever reason, utilize\r\n2255, and in which the failure to allow for collateral review\r\nwould raise serious constitutional questions.\"  Triestman, 124 F.3d\r\nat 377.  The Triestman court found that such serious questions were\r\nraised where \"a person . . . can prove his actual innocence on the\r\nexisting record\" and \"could not have effectively raised his claim\r\nof innocence at an earlier time.\"  Id. at 363, 377-78; see also id.\r\nat 368 n.8 (concluding that the petition at hand would not have\r\nbeen barred under the pre-AEDPA \"abuse of the writ\" doctrine). \r\n\"[T]he cases in which serious questions as to  2255's\r\nconstitutional validity are presented will be relatively few . .\r\n. .  In reaching this result, we therefore respect Congress' intent\r\nto streamline collateral review and to discourage repetitive and\r\npiecemeal litigation, while at the same time we give meaning to\r\nCongress' express decision (reaffirmed in the AEDPA) to preserve\r\nhabeas corpus for federal prisoners in those extraordinary\r\ninstances where justice demands it.\"  Id. at 377-78.\r\nTo the extent that these cases were concerned with the\r\nstatus of a petitioner's claim under pre-AEDPA abuse of the writ\r\nlaw, they may have been narrowed, in effect, by the holding of the\r\nSupreme Court in Bousley v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118205\"><a href=\"/opinion/118205/bousley-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Turpin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118058\"><a href=\"/opinion/118058/felker-v-turpin/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">651</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 664 (1996) (\"In\r\nMcCleskey . . . , we said that 'the doctrine of abuse of the writ\r\nrefers to a complex and evolving body of equitable principles\r\ninformed and controlled by historical usage, statutory\r\ndevelopments, and judicial decisions.'

Therefore, as Barrett implicitly acknowledges,\r\napplication of the AEDPA standards to bar his  2255 petition --\r\nwhich would have been barred pre-AEDPA in any event -- does not\r\nraise any serious constitutional question.

However, this\r\nstatement must be read in light of Morgan's broad concern about\r\nwhether any possibility of coram nobis survived the enactment of\r\n2255, a provision which was intended to \"restate[], clarif[y] and\r\nsimplif[y] the procedure in the nature of the ancient writ of error\r\ncoram nobis,\" 28 U.S.C.  2255 Historical and Statutory Notes 1948\r\nEnactment, and the enactment of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\r\n60(b), which \"expressly abolish[ed] the writ of error coram nobis\r\nin civil cases,\"  Morgan, 346 U.S. at 505 n.4.   Although the Court\r\nconcluded that coram nobis was available to the Morgan petitioner,\r\nthe Court did not hold that there are situations in which both\r\n2255 and coram nobis are applicable.  The Morgan petitioner was\r\nno longer \"in custody,\" as is required in order to seek  2255\r\nrelief.  See id. at 503-04.\r\nIndeed, as the Supreme Court noted in rejecting the use\r\nof coram nobis in Carlisle v.

See, e.g., United States v. Brown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"71897\"><a href=\"/opinion/71897/united-states-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n475 (11th Cir. 1997); United States v.

The fact that  2255 bars his second\r\npetition at its inception does not make that provision any less\r\ncontrolling.  In Carlisle itself, the Court forbade the use of\r\ncoram nobis to circumvent Rule 29, Fed. R. Civ. P., despite the\r\nfact that application of that rule meant that the defendant's\r\nmotion for a judgment of acquittal was untimely and should have\r\nbeen rejected immediately by the district court without any\r\nconsideration of the merits or any grant of relief.  See Carlisle,\r\n517 U.S. at 428-29, 433; see also Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur.

The writ of coram nobis may not be used to\r\ncircumvent the clear congressional directive embodied in the\r\n\"second or successive\" provisions of  2255, which are themselves\r\na sort of \"timeliness\" requirement.

But we\r\nhave no cause to explore those potential situations in this case,\r\nsince  2255 is not \"inadequate or ineffective\" and so plainly\r\n\"specifically addresses\" the situation that we face.  Carlisle,\r\n517 U.S. at 429 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also\r\nDavenport, 147 F.3d at 608 (\"[I]f Congress has forbidden federal\r\nprisoners to proceed under 2241 even when 2255 is closed to them[,]\r\nthen it would be senseless to suppose that Congress permitted them\r\nto pass through the closed door simply by changing the number 2241\r\nto 1651 on their motions.\").\r\nThe scope of relief obtainable under the All Writs Act is\r\nnarrowed when a statute governing a particular issue is enacted. \r\nHere  2255, as amended by AEDPA, governs.  There is no contention\r\nthat the AEDPA provisions themselves have somehow amended the All\r\nWrits Act.  We conclude merely that Barrett is not permitted to\r\nproceed with a  1651 petition under the circumstances of this\r\ncase.  For the reasons already discussed, barring Barrett's\r\npetition does not present any constitutional difficulties.\r\n                     V\r\nWe have considered Barrett's remaining arguments; they\r\nare without merit.  See United States v. Bongiorno, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"735399\"><a href=\"/opinion/735399/united-states-v-frank-p-bongiorno-united-states-of-america-v-frank-p/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1027</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n1034 (1st Cir. 1997) (explaining that this court has \"steadfastly\r\ndeemed waived issues raised on appeal in a perfunctory manner, not\r\naccompanied by developed argumentation\").  Despite Barrett's\r\nliberal invocation of federal constitutional principles, this case\r\nis in the end simply an example of a garden-variety abuse of the\r\nwrit -- an abuse that would have been forbidden prior to the\r\nenactment of AEDPA and is most certainly barred by AEDPA's more\r\nstringent provisions.  See Pratt, 129 F.3d at 63 (\"[Petitioner]\r\nfailed to marshal all his claims of error in his first section 2255\r\npetition, and he must now pay the piper.  AEDPA governs here, and,\r\non the facts of this case, AEDPA's clear language prohibits\r\n[petitioner] from rectifying his omission by means of a second\r\npetition.\"); cf. Calderon, 118 S. Ct. at 1502; McCleskey, 499 U.S.\r\nat 491-93.\r\nThe lessons of this case for the criminal defense bar are\r\nclear.  A first petition for post-conviction relief under  2255\r\nshould raise all available claims.  Informal reference to a new\r\nclaim in a reply brief will not suffice to raise a claim if the\r\ndistrict court does not address that claim in its order.  Failure\r\nto raise an available claim does not permit an end-run around the\r\nrequirements of  2255 by resort to  2241 or the All Writs Act. \r\nThere is only one bite at the post-conviction apple unless a second\r\nor successive petition can show one of two things:  a new rule of\r\nconstitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review\r\nby the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable, or newly\r\ndiscovered evidence sufficient to establish by clear and convincing\r\nevidence, on the whole record, that no reasonable factfinder would\r\nhave returned a guilty verdict.  A claim of actual innocence --\r\ndefined as factual innocence, not mere legal insufficiency -- will\r\nhave a mechanism for review.\r\nWe therefore affirm the district court's dismissal of\r\nBarrett's petition.  Barrett's appeal is also treated concurrently\r\nas a request for leave to file a second or successive habeas\r\npetition and that request is denied.\n</pre>",
