This appeal revolves around a\r\nbreach of contract claim governed by Peruvian law.  Defendant\r\nGeneral Electric del Caribe, Inc. (\"GE del Caribe\") appeals from\r\nthe September 20, 1996, judgment of the district court finding it\r\nliable for the breach of a contract to purchase 1,000 metric tons\r\nof Pima cotton from the plaintiff, Servicios Comerciales Andinos,\r\nS.A. (\"SECOMAN\"), a Peruvian partnership.  Following a bench trial,\r\nthe district court found for SECOMAN, awarded damages for loss of\r\nprofits caused by the breach, and ordered GE del Caribe to pay a\r\nportion of SECOMAN's attorneys' fees as a sanction under P.R. R.\r\nCiv. P. 44.1 for its obstinate conduct during litigation.  GE del\r\nCaribe appeals the finding of breach, the determination of damages,\r\nand the imposition of sanctions.  We affirm in part and reverse in\r\npart.\r\nI.  Background\r\nWe recite the facts in the light most favorable to the\r\ndistrict court's findings of fact.  See Wainwright Bank &amp; Trust Co.v. Boulos, 89 F.3d 17, 18 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\nSECOMAN had been engaged in the purchase and resale of\r\nTanguis cotton since its founding in 1977.  Until 1989, SECOMAN was\r\nlicensed to sell cotton only inside Peru.  At that time, SECOMAN\r\nattempted to enter the international cotton market, first by\r\nobtaining a license to export cotton from Peru, and then by\r\nentering into a joint venture with another Peruvian business to buy\r\ncotton and resell it on the international market.  The joint\r\nventure focused on Pima rather than Tanguis cotton because Pima\r\ncotton is of higher quality and is generally in greater demand. \r\nMoreover, at the time there was a substantial differential between\r\nthe price at which Pima cotton could be purchased from cotton\r\nproducers in Peru and the international market price.  In order to\r\nbuild a stock of cotton for export, SECOMAN obtained lines of\r\ncredit, totaling $2,000,000, from various Peruvian banks.  In the\r\nfall of 1989, SECOMAN began to purchase Pima cotton.\r\nGE del Caribe, a corporation organized under the laws of\r\nPuerto Rico, is a subsidiary of the GE Supply Company, based in\r\nConnecticut, which is in turn a division of the General Electric\r\nCompany.  As its name suggests, GE del Caribe is engaged in the\r\nsale of General Electric products in the Caribbean, Central\r\nAmerica, and South America.  Mr. Enrique Aranda, a Peruvian\r\nnational, was the president of GE del Caribe from 1986 to 1993.  In\r\n1990, he was trying to increase his company's sales by penetrating\r\ndifferent Latin American markets. \r\nIn early 1990, Mr. Aranda spoke with a friend in Peru,\r\nMr. Huertas del Pino, who was the president of Carmel Export\r\nAgency, Inc. (\"Carmel\"), and who informed him that through his\r\ncontacts there, he could facilitate GE del Caribe's expansion into\r\nthat market.  In particular, Mr. Huertas had a business\r\nrelationship with Horizon Trading, Inc. (\"Horizon\"), a Peruvian\r\nentity established in the Cayman Islands and engaged in the export\r\nof Peruvian products.\r\nAround the same time, Horizon was informed that there was\r\na seller on the market ready to provide 1,000 tons of Pima cotton\r\nfor sale at $1.70 per pound, and that the seller was willing to pay\r\na commission on the sale.  Horizon communicated this information,\r\nas well as the fact that the international price for Pima cotton\r\nwas $2.40 per pound, to Mr. Huertas, who replied that he believed\r\nthat he could find a buyer.\r\nThat person was Mr. Aranda.  Mr. Huertas arranged for a\r\nmeeting to take place in Peru between Mr. Aranda and several\r\nPeruvian businessmen who were interested in exporting cotton and\r\nother Peruvian products.  In preparation for the meeting,\r\nMr. Aranda requested that both Mr. Huertas and a GE del Caribe\r\nemployee provide him with information regarding the cotton market. \r\nHe received samples of SECOMAN's Pima cotton, and began to research\r\nthe possibility of reselling the cotton abroad.\r\nThe meeting was held on Friday, March 23, 1990, at the\r\nCaesar's Palace Hotel in Lima, Peru.  Among those present was\r\nMr. Alfredo Gordillo, general manager and 90% owner of SECOMAN.  At\r\nthe meeting, Mr. Aranda told Mr. Gordillo that he was interested in\r\npurchasing the cotton that SECOMAN had in stock.  Although\r\nMr. Gordillo was offering only 600 tons, when asked whether he\r\ncould supply more he stated that he could export up to a total of\r\n1,000 tons, at $1.72 per pound.  After the meeting, Mr. Aranda\r\ncalled Mr. Gordillo and insisted that the two of them meet again\r\nthe following day to discuss the transaction.  \r\nAt the second meeting, held in Mr. Gordillo's office,\r\nMr. Aranda and Mr. Gordillo negotiated the details of an agreement\r\npursuant to which GE del Caribe would purchase 1,000 tons of Pima\r\ncotton from SECOMAN.  Among other things, Mr. Gordillo agreed to\r\nMr. Aranda's request that the asking price be reduced to $1.58 per\r\npound.  Payment was to be made by a negotiable letter of credit,\r\nwith a face value of $2,800,000, which would be submitted to\r\nSECOMAN for its approval.  GE del Caribe was also to make an\r\ninitial deposit of $100,000 in Mr. Gordillo's account in a Miami,\r\nFlorida bank.  As they had discussed the day before, SECOMAN had\r\n600 tons of Pima cotton in stock and ready to ship immediately. \r\nMr. Aranda agreed to allow SECOMAN an additional two weeks to\r\npurchase and ship the extra 400 tons.  \r\nMr. Gordillo also asked Mr. Aranda whether he had pre-\r\nsold the cotton.  Mr. Aranda replied that he had not, but that he\r\nhad some prospects.  Mr. Aranda asked Mr. Gordillo for the names of\r\nsome of SECOMAN's clients, which Mr. Gordillo agreed to do if\r\nMr. Aranda's prospective buyers did not purchase the cotton. \r\nMr. Gordillo also offered SECOMAN's services as a sales agent for\r\nGE del Caribe, given SECOMAN's greater expertise in the cotton\r\nmarket.  Mr. Aranda agreed, but only on condition that SECOMAN not\r\noffer the same cotton for sale without GE's prior written\r\nauthorization.  Finally, Mr. Gordillo asked Mr. Aranda to have GE\r\ndel Caribe confirm his authority to enter into the agreement.\r\nBecause it was a Saturday, Mr. Gordillo did not have\r\nsecretarial assistance in the office, and he therefore suggested\r\nthat the agreement be drafted at a later date.  Mr. Aranda stated,\r\nhowever, that he would rather have a document drafted immediately,\r\nand then proceeded to type up the substance of their agreements in\r\nEnglish in a document entitled \"Agreement to Purchase\"\r\n(\"Agreement\").  Both of them then signed the Agreement.\r\nInitially, the parties began to perform their respective\r\nduties under the Agreement.  Thus, on March 29, 1990, GE's Vice\r\nPresident of Finance sent a letter by facsimile to SECOMAN\r\nratifying the Agreement, indicating that Mr. Aranda was \"authorized\r\nby GE del Caribe to negotiate and conclude business deals such as\r\nthe one we have concluded on March 24 with [SECOMAN].\"  On\r\nApril 20, 1990, GE del Caribe deposited the agreed-upon $100,000 in\r\nMr. Gordillo's bank account.  SECOMAN, in the meantime, began\r\npurchasing additional Pima cotton to comply with its duty to\r\nprovide a total of 1,000 tons of cotton.\r\nMr. Aranda had also immediately begun to seek buyers for\r\nthe cotton at $1.90 per pound.  However, by April 5, 1990, he had\r\nnot yet found any buyers, so on that day he wrote to SECOMAN\r\nindicating that the sale of the cotton was taking longer than\r\nforeseen and requesting an additional eight working days to\r\nconclude the sale.  At the same time, Mr. Huertas was also\r\nnegotiating the sale of 1,000 tons of Pima cotton at $1.90 per\r\npound.  Mr. Huertas also required the prospective buyer to make a\r\n$100,000 deposit.  Although Mr. Huertas claimed that it was merely\r\na coincidence that he was offering Pima cotton for sale on the same\r\nterms as GE del Caribe, the district court found that Mr. Huertas\r\nhad no cotton of his own, but was instead helping Mr. Aranda to\r\nfind a buyer for the cotton that GE del Caribe had purchased from\r\nSECOMAN.  \r\nThroughout the late spring and early summer of 1990, the\r\ninternational market price for Pima cotton was steadily dropping,\r\ndooming Mr. Aranda's efforts to sell the cotton that GE del Caribe\r\nhad purchased from SECOMAN.  For example, on May 14, 1990,\r\nMr. Aranda contacted again a potential purchaser who had offered to\r\nbuy the cotton at $1.70 per pound, but had originally been turned\r\ndown because GE del Caribe was asking for $1.90 per pound.  Even\r\nthough Mr. Aranda lowered the sale price to $1.73 per pound, the\r\nofferee rejected the offer noting that the world price had dropped\r\neven further.\r\nIn mid-April, Mr. Aranda began to visit banks in Puerto\r\nRico to obtain the letter of credit that was due under the\r\nAgreement.  At that time, he had not yet informed his superiors of\r\nhis trip to Peru, of the existence of the Agreement, or of his\r\nefforts to sell the cotton.  The banks, however, would not issue a\r\nletter of credit without a guarantee, or \"letter of comfort,\" from\r\nGE's parent company.  Therefore, in early May, Mr. Aranda sought\r\nthe assistance of his superiors in GE Supply Co., explaining that\r\nGE del Caribe needed the letter of comfort in order to obtain the\r\nletter of credit that SECOMAN was to receive pursuant to the\r\nAgreement.  He also explained that GE del Caribe stood to gain\r\n$300,000 on the sale of the cotton.\r\nMr. Aranda's superiors, however, refused to issue the\r\nletter of comfort, instructed him not to comply further with the\r\nAgreement, and began to investigate the matter.  On May 23, 1990,\r\nMr. James Ambrose, who was the Chairman of the Board of Directors\r\nof GE del Caribe as well as an officer in GE Supply, flew to Puerto\r\nRico to discuss the Agreement with Mr. Aranda.  Mr. Ambrose\r\nexpressed his displeasure over the fact that Mr. Aranda had\r\ncommitted GE del Caribe to this transaction without the approval of\r\nthe Board of Directors.  At its next meeting, the Board reprimanded\r\nMr. Aranda for his actions.\r\nThe district court concluded that from that point on, GE\r\ndel Caribe sought ways to shirk its duties under the contract.  In\r\nparticular, after much delay, GE del Caribe sent SECOMAN a\r\nrevocable letter of credit.  SECOMAN rejected the proffered letter\r\nand requested, instead, a confirmed, irrevocable letter of credit. \r\nOn June 11, 1990, GE del Caribe wrote to SECOMAN claiming that\r\nSECOMAN's rejection of the proffered letters was an essential\r\nbreach of the contract that entitled GE del Caribe to resolve the\r\nAgreement.  However, the district court determined that SECOMAN had\r\nnot breached any obligation in rejecting the revocable letter of\r\ncredit, since such a letter did not satisfy the requirement,\r\nimposed by the Agreement, that GE del Caribe produce a negotiableletter of credit because only irrevocable letters of credit can be\r\nnegotiable.  The district court further determined that GE del\r\nCaribe's violation of this aspect of the contract was willful and\r\nin bad faith, since it knew that the Agreement required that the\r\nletter of credit be irrevocable.\r\nGE del Caribe's initial delay and eventual failure to\r\nprocure an irrevocable letter of credit not only deprived SECOMAN\r\nof its expected profit on the Pima cotton transaction, but also\r\nstarted a chain reaction that devastated SECOMAN's finances.  GE\r\ndel Caribe's failure to tender a negotiable letter of credit\r\nrendered SECOMAN unable to meet its obligations under the lines of\r\ncredit it had opened the year before.  SECOMAN was then reported to\r\nthe Superintendent of Banks and Insurance of Peru for its failure\r\nto meet these obligations and placed on a list of defaulting\r\nentities.  The listing prevented SECOMAN from obtaining any further\r\nfinancing, which in turn prevented SECOMAN from purchasing the\r\nadditional cotton that it was required to deliver under two\r\ndifferent contracts with other parties.  Because of its breach of\r\nits obligations under these contracts, the buyers filed demands for\r\narbitration against SECOMAN.  Awards were entered against SECOMAN\r\nin both arbitrations.  Thus, in addition to losing its expected\r\nprofits on those contracts, SECOMAN was ordered to pay damages to\r\nthe buyers.  Finally, the cumulative effect of these losses was to\r\nreduce SECOMAN's value as a going concern.\r\nSECOMAN subsequently filed suit against GE del Caribe for\r\nbreach of contract in the U.S. District Court for the District of\r\nPuerto Rico, alleging alienage jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.\r\n1332(a)(2).  Before trial, the parties stipulated that their\r\ndispute was governed by Peruvian law.  After an extensive bench\r\ntrial, the district court determined that GE del Caribe had not\r\nonly breached the Agreement, but also that it had done so with\r\n\"dolo\" or dolus -- that is, in bad faith.  Under Peruvian contract\r\nlaw, a defendant who breaches a contract in bad faith is liable for\r\nall damages proximately caused by the breach, including\r\nunforeseeable damages.  See Cdigo Civil (C. Civ.) art. 1321\r\n(Peru).  Accordingly, the district court's award of damages to\r\nSECOMAN included its loss of profits on the sale of cotton to GE\r\ndel Caribe, as well as all other losses it suffered as a\r\nconsequence of the breach.  Finally, the district court required GE\r\ndel Caribe to pay a certain portion of SECOMAN's attorney's fees,\r\nas a sanction for GE's obstinate conduct.  GE del Caribe then filed\r\nthe appeal that is now before us.\r\nII.  Standard of Review\r\nWe review de novo a district court's conclusions of law. \r\nSee Exxon Corp. v. Esso Workers' Union, Inc., 118 F.3d 841, 844\r\n(1st Cir. 1997).  In this regard, a district court's determination\r\nof foreign law \"shall be treated as a ruling on a question of law.\" \r\nFed. R. Civ. P. 44.1.  In contrast, \"[i]n all actions tried upon\r\nthe facts without a jury,\" a district court's \"[f]indings of fact,\r\nwhether based on oral or documentary evidence, shall not be set\r\naside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to\r\nthe opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the\r\nwitnesses.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a); see La Esperanza de P.R., Inc.v. Prez y Ca. de P.R., Inc., 124 F.3d 10 (1st Cir. 1997).  \"We\r\nwill conclude that a finding is clearly erroneous only when, after\r\nreviewing the entire record, we are left with the definite and firm\r\nconviction that a mistake has been committed.\"  Strahan v. Coxe,  \r\n127 F.3d 155, 172 (1st Cir. 1997), petition for cert. filed, 66\r\nU.S.L.W. 3605 (U.S. Mar.  6, 1998) (No.  97-1485) (citations\r\nomitted).\r\nSome questions presented to a trial court, however, are\r\nneither pure questions of law nor of fact.  We review \"mixed\"\r\nquestions of law and fact \"along a degree-of-deference continuum,\r\nranging from plenary review for law-dominated questions to\r\nclear-error review for fact-dominated questions.\"  Inmates of\r\nSuffolk County Jail v. Rouse, 129 F.3d 649, 661 (1st Cir. 1997),\r\npetition for cert.  filed, 66 U.S.L.W. 3531 (U.S. Feb.  4, 1998) \r\n(No. 97-1278) (quoting Johnson v. Watts Regulator Co., 63 F.3d\r\n1129, 1132 (1st Cir. 1995)).  Thus, \"the applicable standard of\r\nreview varies depending upon the nature of the mixed question; the\r\nmore fact-dominated it is, the more likely that deferential,\r\nclear-error review will obtain, and the more law-dominated it is,\r\nthe more likely that non-deferential, de novo review will obtain.\" \r\nSierra Fra Corp. v. Donald J. Evans, P.C., 127 F.3d 175, 181 (1st\r\nCir. 1997).\r\nContract interpretation often presents mixed questions of\r\nlaw and fact.  We thus employ a bifurcated standard in reviewing a\r\ndistrict court's interpretation of a contract.  See Boston Car Co.v. Acura Auto. Div., Honda Motor Co., 971 F.2d 811, 815 (1st Cir.\r\n1992).  On the one hand, \"it is for the court to determine whether\r\nthe terms of an integrated agreement are unambiguous and, if so, to\r\nconstrue them according to their plain meaning.\"  United States\r\nLiab. Ins. Co. v. Selman, 70 F.3d 684, 687 (1st Cir. 1995). \r\nAppellate review of such determinations is, accordingly, de novo. \r\nSee id.  On the other hand, \"when the district court's answers rest\r\nnot on plain meaning but on differential findings by the trier of\r\nfact, derived from extrinsic evidence as to the parties' intent\r\nwith regard to an uncertain contract provision, appellate review\r\nproceeds under the 'clearly erroneous' standard.\"  Id.; see alsoICC v. Holmes Transp. Inc., 983 F.2d 1122, 1126 (1st Cir. 1993);\r\nGel Sys., Inc. v. Hyundai Eng'g &amp; Constr. Co., 902 F.2d 1024, 1027\r\n(1st Cir. 1990).\r\nIII.  Analysis\r\nA.  Breach of Contract\r\nGE del Caribe contends that the district court erred in\r\ndetermining that it breached its obligations under the \"Agreement\r\nto Purchase,\" for the simple reason that the Agreement was not a\r\nfinal and binding contract under the law of Peru.  In support of\r\nits claim, GE del Caribe points out three different flaws in the\r\nAgreement that arguably prevent it from being a binding contract. \r\nFirst, GE del Caribe claims that the Agreement fails to comply with\r\nC. Civ. art. 1359, which provides that \"[n]o contract exists as\r\nlong as the parties do not agree with all of its stipulations, even\r\nif the discrepancy is secondary,\" because the Agreement lacks an\r\nundertaking to purchase, a price term, a delivery term, and an\r\nagreement on the terms for the letter of credit.  Second, GE del\r\nCaribe contends that the district court's reliance on evidence\r\nextrinsic to the Agreement, particularly in determining that the\r\nAgreement's \"facilitation\" clause contained a drafting error, was\r\nultra vires because, under Peruvian law, a court may not use\r\nextrinsic evidence to interpret a contract, let alone to rewrite\r\nits clear and unambiguous terms.  Third, and finally, GE del Caribe\r\nasserts that the district court erred in rejecting GE del Caribe's\r\nargument that the Agreement was invalid because its purpose was\r\nunlawful.  \r\n  1.  Conclusions of Law  \r\nIn its first two arguments, GE del Caribe implicitly\r\ncontends that the district court erred both by failing to apply\r\ncorrectly the rules of contractual hermeneutics required by the\r\nPeruvian Civil Code, and by finding ambiguity in the terms of the\r\ncontract when there was none.  However, GE del Caribe's arguments\r\nare also based in part on claims that the district court\r\nmisapprehended the evidence.  As we discussed above, we review de\r\nnovo the district court's determinations of Peruvian law and of the\r\nambiguousness of the terms of the Agreement, but we review the\r\ncourt's findings of fact only for clear error.  For the sake of\r\nclarity and convenience, we first address the questions of law and\r\nof contractual hermeneutics, and only then pass on to evaluate the\r\ndistrict court's findings of fact.\r\n     a. Terms of the Agreement \r\nGE del Caribe's first argument begins with the claim that\r\nC. Civ. art. 1359 establishes that there can be no contract if the\r\nparties have not reached an agreement as to every element of the\r\ncontract, whether primary or secondary.  This assumes that a lackof agreement as to any contractual terms, as opposed to a\r\ndisagreement, is enough to prevent a contract from arising. \r\nContending that the Agreement lacked an undertaking to purchase and\r\nreflected no agreement on price, date of delivery, or the essential\r\nterms of the letter of credit, GE del Caribe concludes that there\r\nwas no contract.\r\nGE del Caribe's argument is subtly but seriously flawed. \r\nThe fundamental problem is that, contrary to GE's assertions,\r\nArticle 1359 does not require the affirmative agreement of the\r\nparties as to each and every term of a contract.  Instead, Article\r\n1359 distinguishes between essential and non-essential terms,\r\nrequiring affirmative agreement as to essential terms, but merely\r\nrequiring that there be no disagreement as to non-essential terms. \r\nSee Manuel de la Puente y Lavalle, El Contrato en General[Contracts in General], Pt. 1, Tome 1, at 397-98 (Lima, Peru\r\n1993).\r\nSilence as to an essential term is fatal; that is to say,\r\nthere can be no contract unless the parties have affirmatively\r\nagreed to the essential terms of the contract.  The crucial problem\r\nis determining which terms are essential and which are not.  As one\r\ncommentator has noted, some terms are objectively essential, while\r\nothers are only subjectively essential.  See id. at 392. \r\nObjectively essential terms are those elements of a contract that\r\nare made necessary by the very nature of the contract, without\r\nregard to the parties' subjective intent.  See id.  Of course, the\r\ndifficulty of the task of determining which elements are\r\nobjectively essential depends on the type of contract involved:\r\nNotwithstanding that it is relatively\r\ndifficult to establish, as a general rule,\r\njust which are the essential terms of each\r\n[type of] contract, the task is easier\r\nwhen it involves those types of contracts\r\nthat are defined by law, such as the\r\ncontracts [] defined in the Peruvian Civil\r\nCode. . . .  Thus, for example, insofar as\r\nArticle 1529 of the Code defines the\r\ncontract of sale as the contract whereby a\r\nseller binds himself to transfer the\r\nownership of a good to a buyer, and the\r\nlatter to pay a price in money, the\r\nessential terms of that contract are the\r\ngood  and the price. . . .  The problem is\r\nmore delicate with regard to atypical\r\ncontracts, in which, because of a lack of\r\n[legislative] definition, it is hardly\r\npossible to determine which contractual\r\nobligations are essential and which are\r\nsecondary. . . .  [I]t is therefore\r\nnecessary to analyze, case by case, the\r\nbusiness purpose of the contract so as to\r\ndetermine which obligations are\r\nindispensable for its success: such\r\nobligations will constitute the essential\r\nelements of the contract.\r\n\nM. de la Puente y Lavalle, El Contrato en General [Contracts in\r\nGeneral], Pt. 1, Tome 1, at 392 (emphasis supplied). Subjectively\r\nessential terms, in contrast, are those which, even though they are\r\nnot objectively essential, are deemed to be essential by the\r\ncontracting parties.  See id.  For example, although a delivery\r\nterm is not objectively essential to a contract of sale (for\r\nreasons discussed below), the parties to such a contract may very\r\nwell consider these essential to the negotiations.  The question\r\nwhether a particular term is subjectively essential presents a\r\nissue of fact.\r\nSilence with regard to non-essential terms, in contrast,\r\nis not fatal because the Civil Code's norms regarding contracts\r\n\"are suppletory to the will of the parties, save for those that are\r\nimperative.\"  C. Civ. art. 1356.  Article 1356 must be read in\r\nconjunction with C. Civ. art. 1354, which, in stating that \"[t]he\r\nparties may freely determine the content of a contract, so long as\r\nit is not contrary to any imperative legal norms,\" establishes a\r\ndistinction between the imperative and optional provisions of the\r\nCivil Code.  Optional norms are presumed to apply to a given\r\ncontract, but parties may elect otherwise, whereas the parties may\r\nnot opt out of imperative norms.  Stated differently, a contract\r\nis subject to all imperative norms, as well as any optional norms\r\nnot excluded by the parties.  \r\nThus, the parties' silence as to any non-essential term\r\nis not fatal under Article 1359 because the Code's optional norms\r\nprovide the missing terms.  In contrast, if rather than silence we\r\nfind disagreement as to any such term, then there can be no\r\ncontract, because the fact that there is a dispute over a given\r\nterm rebuts the presumption that the parties would consent to the\r\nincorporation of the Code's suppletory norms.\r\nAs noted before, GE del Caribe claims that the Agreement\r\nto purchase was not a contract because it lacked an undertaking to\r\npurchase, a price term, a delivery term, and an agreement on the\r\nterms for the letter of credit.  The claim fails, for a variety of\r\nreasons.  With regard to the two essential terms that GE del Caribe\r\ncontends were missing, these were found by the district court to be\r\npresent.  For example, the alleged lack of an explicit undertaking\r\nto purchase is irrelevant because the district court found that\r\nsuch an undertaking was implicit in the Agreement.  Similarly, the\r\ndistrict court found that the line in the Agreement stating \"Cost\r\noffered per pound: $1.58 USD\" was an explicit price term.\r\nThe lack of an explicit agreement on the time and place\r\nof delivery does not prevent a contract from arising in this case.\r\nThe delivery term is not objectively essential to a contract of\r\nsale because C. Civ. arts. 1552 and 1553 provide default rules\r\ngoverning the time and place of delivery.  Moreover, there is no\r\nevidence on the record that the delivery term was subjectively\r\nessential, and articles 1552 and 1553 are not excluded either\r\nexplicitly or implicitly by the terms of the Agreement to Purchase. \r\nConsequently, these provisions are applicable to this contract.\r\nFinally, the argument based on the letter of credit is\r\nalso unconvincing.  The method of payment is not an objectively\r\nessential term of a contract of sale.  Moreover, although the\r\nparties to a sales contract could consider the method of payment to\r\nbe subjectively essential, there is no indication that such was the\r\ncase here.  In particular, reviewing the text of the Agreement, we\r\nfind no stipulation that the content of the letter was to be the\r\nsine qua non of the Agreement. \r\nThe specific content and format of the letter of credit\r\nwere thus secondary, non-essential terms of the Agreement.  As\r\ndiscussed above, only disagreement as to such terms is fatal under\r\nArticle 1359.  The problem here is that the text of the Agreement\r\ndoes not indicate the existence of a disagreement, or even that the\r\nparties agreed to leave the specifics of the letter of credit open\r\nfor future negotiation.  Specifically, it is not clear to us that\r\nthe requirement that a draft of the letter be submitted to SECOMAN\r\nfor its approval necessarily means that the parties had not already\r\nagreed upon the content of the letter.  To the contrary, the\r\nrequirement may very well have been intended merely to allow\r\nSECOMAN the opportunity to ensure that the letter of credit was\r\ndrafted in accordance with the terms already agreed upon. \r\nAccordingly, it fell upon GE del Caribe to prove to the district\r\ncourt by a preponderance of the evidence that the parties had\r\nagreed to postpone their negotiation over the details of the letter\r\nof credit.  The district court, however, found that GE del Caribe\r\nfailed to carry that burden.\r\n     b.  Redrafting of the \"facilitation\" clause and\r\n     consideration of extrinsic evidence\r\n\nThe clause in question states: \"The SELLERS guarantee the\r\nfollowing: . . . That the SELLERS will use GE del Caribe as\r\nfacilitators and sales consultants during this transaction. \r\nSELLERS will not negotiate sale of the lot aforementioned without\r\nthe written agreement of GE del Caribe.\"  The district court found\r\nthat this clause was not consistent with the most natural reading\r\nof the rest of the Agreement, which otherwise seemed to be a\r\ncontract for the sale of cotton.  Moreover, SECOMAN presented\r\nevidence that the \"facilitation\" clause had been incorrectly\r\ndrafted by Mr. Aranda, because the actual agreement between Mr.\r\nGordillo and himself provided that SECOMAN would act as facilitator\r\nand sales consultant for GE del Caribe, not the other way around. \r\nThe district court believed this evidence, and ruled accordingly. \r\nGE del Caribe claims, however, that Peruvian law\r\nprohibits courts from using extrinsic evidence to rewrite the clear\r\nand unambiguous terms of an agreement, and therefore that the\r\ndistrict court's determination that the Agreement's \"facilitation\"\r\nclause contained a drafting error was ultra vires.  Although\r\nagreeing with the court that the \"facilitation\" clause was not\r\nconsistent with the view that the Agreement was a contract of sale,\r\nGE del Caribe argues that the clause means what it says, that the\r\ncourt could not ignore the inconsistency, and thus that the only\r\nlegally permissible conclusion to be drawn from the inconsistency\r\nwas that the Agreement was not a contract of sale.\r\nGE del Caribe is correct in stating that Peruvian law\r\ndoes not permit a court to rewrite the clear and unambiguous terms\r\nof a contract; however, Peruvian law does permit a court to inquire\r\ninto the common intention of the parties if the terms of the\r\ncontract are unclear or ambiguous.  Contrary to GE del Caribe's\r\nassertion, several of the Agreement's provisions are ambiguous and\r\nconfusing.  The source of the problem is evident.  GE del Caribe's\r\nargument is premised on the erroneous assumption that a contractual\r\nprovision is ambiguous only when its words are literally unclear. \r\nTo the contrary, contractual provisions may be ambiguous, even if\r\ntheir words are otherwise clear, if their meaning is placed in\r\nquestion by the context in which they are found. \r\nIn order to explain our conclusion, we review some basic\r\nconcepts of Peruvian contractual hermeneutics.  Pursuant to C. Civ.\r\nart. 1352, \"[c]ontracts are perfected by the consent of the\r\nparties, except for those which, in addition, must observe the form\r\nrequired by law under penalty of nullity.\"  Thus, Peruvian law does\r\nnot require any particular form for contracts, except for certain\r\nspecific types of contracts that are not relevant here.  Instead,\r\nthe Peruvian Civil Code contains a number of provisions designed to\r\nguide the parties (and the courts) in the interpretation of\r\ncontracts, no matter what their form.  \r\nThe most basic of these provisions are C. Civ. arts. 168,\r\n169, and 170, which regulate the interpretation of all \"juridical\r\nacts,\" including contracts.  In particular, Article 168 provides\r\nthat \"[a] legal act must be interpreted in accordance with its\r\ncontent and with the principle of good faith,\"  Article 169\r\nprovides that \"[a] clause in a legal act is interpreted in the\r\nlight of the other clauses, and those clauses which are dubious are\r\nascribed the meaning arising from the whole,\" and Article 170\r\nprovides that \"[s]tatements that have several meanings must be\r\nunderstood to have the meaning that is most suitable to the nature\r\nand object of the legal act.\"  In addition, there are a number of\r\nhermeneutic rules that are specifically applicable to contracts. \r\nFor example, C. Civ. art. 1361 provides that \"[c]ontracts are\r\nbinding as to what is expressed in them.  It is presumed that the\r\nstatements expressed in a contract reflect the common will of the\r\nparties, and whomever denies [that the statements do reflect the\r\ncommon will] must prove it.\"  Moreover, C. Civ. art. 1362\r\nemphasizes that \"[c]ontracts must be negotiated, executed, and\r\nperformed according to the rules of good faith and the common\r\nintent of the parties.\"  The principle of good faith has been\r\ninterpreted to imply, among other things, the principle of\r\nconservation of contracts, which requires that contracts be\r\ninterpreted whenever possible in such a way as to preserve their\r\nvalidity.  See Manuel Miranda-Canales, Derecho de los Contratos[The Law of Contracts], at 33-34 (Lima, Peru 1986).\r\nAs GE del Caribe correctly states, the theory underlying\r\nthese provisions is known as the objectivist theory of\r\ninterpretation.  See Fernando Vidal-Ramrez, Tratado de Derecho\r\nCivil [Treatise on Civil Law], Tome III, Vol. I, at 395 (Lima, Peru\r\n1990); see generally M. de la Puente y Lavalle, El Contrato en\r\nGeneral, Pt. 1, Tome 1, at 121-52 (from which much of the following\r\ndiscussion is derived).  However, GE's interpretation of the\r\nobjectivist approach is incorrect.  As noted above, although under\r\nPeruvian law a contract is perfected by the consent of the parties,\r\nsee C. Civ. art. 1352, consent as a mere subjective mental state\r\nhas no legal effect.  Instead, some outward sign of consent, some\r\ndeclaration of the common will of the parties is required. \r\nUnfortunately, the possibility then arises that the declaration of\r\nwill may not accurately reflect the subjective common will of the\r\nparties.\r\nVarious theories have been developed in order to resolve\r\nthe problems that may be caused by this discrepancy.  The two most\r\ninfluential theories, the subjectivist and the objectivist, seem\r\nalso to be diametrically opposed to each other.  The subjectivist\r\ntheory requires the parties to subjectively consent to the\r\ncontract, and treats the declaration of will merely as evidence of\r\nthe subjective will of the parties.  In contrast, pursuant to the\r\npure version of the objectivist theory, the declaration of will\r\nprevails over the subjective common will of the parties, so that if\r\nthe declaration appears to indicate that the parties consented to\r\nthe contract, the contract will be upheld even if the parties had\r\nnot, in fact, had the requisite subjective intent.\r\nAlthough GE del Caribe claims that Peru has adopted the\r\n\"pure\" version of the objectivist theory, that is clearly not the\r\ncase.  To the contrary, the provisions of the Peruvian Civil Code\r\nreflect a less strict version of the objectivist theory, sometimes\r\nreferred to as the \"reliance\" theory.  See M. de la Puente y\r\nLavalle, El Contrato en General, Pt. 1, Tome 1, at 149-51\r\n(describing the \"teora de la confianza\"); see also Vidal-Ramrez,\r\nTratado de Derecho Civil, at 374-78.  In particular, Article 1361\r\nestablishes only a rebuttable presumption that the declaration\r\nexpressed in the contract reflects the common will of the parties. \r\n\"This approach conserves the benefits of the [objectivist] system,\r\nand, in particular, its security, but it also leaves the way open\r\nfor the interpreter to determine the subjective intent of the\r\ndeclarant,\" which furnishes evidence of the common will of the\r\nparties.  Id. \r\nThus, notwithstanding GE del Caribe's arguments to the\r\ncontrary, it is simply not true that Peruvian law bars courts from\r\nconsidering evidence extrinsic to the text of an ambiguous or\r\nunclear contract.  A contract is interpreted as a whole (not as a\r\nseries of disjointed, independent clauses), and in light of its\r\nnature and purpose.  See C. Civ. arts. 169, 170.  Consequently,\r\nwhen an individual clause appears to be inconsistent with the\r\nothers and with the purpose of the contract, a court is empowered\r\nto inquire further into the common will of the parties.  In doing\r\nso, the court operates under a presumption that the text of the\r\nclause in question reflects the common will of the parties, but the\r\npresumption may be rebutted by evidence to the contrary as to the\r\ncommon will of the parties.  See C. Civ. art. 1361.  A fortiori,\r\nthat evidence can only be evidence that is extrinsic to the\r\ncontract.  If the evidence is sufficient to rebut the Article 1361\r\npresumption, the court may enforce the terms of the contract as it\r\nfinds that they were agreed to, rather than as they were written. \r\nSee Lavalle-Zago, Contratos at 197-98.\r\nWith regard to the case at hand, we agree with the\r\ndistrict court's conclusion that the \"facilitation\" clause was not\r\nconsistent with the rest of the contract.  The contract was\r\nentitled \"Agreement to Purchase,\" and labeled the parties as\r\n\"BUYERS\" and \"SELLERS.\"  Most of the other clauses in the contract\r\nwere consistent with the interpretation that the Agreement was, in\r\nfact, a contract for the sale of cotton.  The first sentence in the\r\nfacilitation clause, however, indicates that SECOMAN is to use GE\r\ndel Caribe as a facilitator and sales consultant, which, as both\r\nparties agree, is difficult to reconcile with the view that the\r\nAgreement is a sales contract.\r\nThere are at least two alternative interpretations of\r\nthis discrepancy, the one advocated by SECOMAN and adopted by the\r\ndistrict court, and the one espoused by GE del Caribe.  As one\r\ncommentator has noted with regard to Article 168, courts are not\r\nrequired to interpret words literally, \"when such an interpretation\r\nwould lead to [an] absurd [result] or to contradiction.\"  Lavalle-\r\nZago, Contratos at 194.  In this case, both parties'\r\ninterpretations may lead to internal contradictions: SECOMAN's\r\ninterpretation appears to be contradicted by the first sentence of\r\nthe facilitation clause, while GE del Caribe's interpretation\r\nappears to be contradicted by the title of the Agreement and the\r\nnomenclature of the parties used therein.  \r\nRegardless of which interpretation is correct, we find\r\nthat the meaning of the facilitation clause was sufficiently\r\ncontentious to make it necessary for the district court to receive\r\nany evidence that was probative of the common will of the parties. \r\nIn this regard, we find no merit in GE del Caribe's claim that the\r\nsubsequent conduct of the parties may not be used by a court in\r\ninterpreting a contract.  To the contrary, when the meaning of a\r\ncontract is unclear, \"the entire behavior of the parties must be\r\nobserved, before, during, and even after the conclusion of the\r\ncontract.\"  Max Arias-Schreiber, Cdigo Civil Peruano de 1984[Peruvian Civil Code of 1984], Tome I, at 89-90 (Lima, Peru 1986).\r\n2.  Findings of Fact\r\nA single reading of the Agreement suggests that the\r\nparties intended to enter into some sort of binding contract.  As\r\nnoted before, the Agreement was entitled \"Agreement to Purchase,\"\r\nlabeled the parties \"BUYERS\" and \"SELLERS,\" indicated the price and\r\nquantity of the cotton being offered, expressed the parties'\r\nvarious guarantees and obligations in imperative language, and was\r\nsigned by the President and Managing Director of GE del Caribe and\r\nSECOMAN, respectively.  At first blush, the Agreement appears to be\r\na contract for the sale of cotton.  \r\nUpon examining the Agreement more closely, however, that\r\ninitial impression is placed in doubt.  For example, the first\r\nsentence of the Agreement states that the parties are agreeing to\r\n\"initiate this agreement to purchase,\" which could lead one to\r\nquestion whether the Agreement was merely designed to pave the way\r\nto further negotiations.  Similarly, the Agreement does not\r\nliterally state that the sellers will sell the cotton, or that the\r\nbuyers will buy it.  Instead, the Agreement indicates that \"[t]he\r\nSELLERS guarantee . . . [t]hat they have available to sell a total\r\nof 1000 metric tons of PIMA cotton,\" and that \"[t]he BUYERS agree\r\n. . . that they will produce a letter of credit (negotiable) with\r\ndue diligence.\"  On the basis of the text alone, it is not possible\r\nto establish with certainty that the Agreement contemplates the\r\nimmediate sale of cotton to GE del Caribe.  Moreover, as we have\r\ndiscussed above, it is very difficult to reconcile the text of the\r\nfacilitation clause with the view that the Agreement is a contract\r\nfor the sale of cotton.\r\nThe district court was faced with the task of making\r\nsense of this unclear text.  GE del Caribe contends that, upon\r\ndetermining that the text alone was insufficient to establish the\r\nexistence of a contract of sale, the court should have ruled that\r\nthere was no contract.  As we have explained, however, when a court\r\nis faced with a text such as this, the principle of conservation of\r\ncontracts directs the court to look beyond the four corners of the\r\ncontract for evidence of the common will of the parties.  After\r\nall, one conclusion that can be drawn with confidence from the text\r\nitself is that the parties intended the Agreement to be binding. \r\nAs GE del Caribe correctly points out, that does not necessarily\r\nmean that the Agreement is a binding contract, because the terms of\r\nthe Agreement must comply with the requirements established by\r\nPeruvian contract law.  It does, however, mean that the court may\r\npresume that the Agreement is a contract, and therefore investigate\r\nfurther to determine what the specific terms of the contract might\r\nbe.  During such an inquiry, moreover, the party claiming that the\r\nAgreement is not a contract bears the burden of proof.  See C. Civ.\r\nart. 1361.\r\nAfter reviewing the evidence that the district court had\r\nbefore it, we conclude that its finding that the Agreement to\r\nPurchase was a binding contract for the sale of cotton was not\r\nclearly erroneous.  First, there is substantial evidence indicating\r\nthat both SECOMAN and GE del Caribe perceived themselves to be\r\nbound by the Agreement and acted accordingly.  Indeed, it would be\r\ndifficult to characterize the evidence that GE del Caribe deposited\r\n$100,000 in Mr. Gordillo's bank account, or that Mr. Aranda made a\r\nsubstantial effort to obtain a confirmed letter of credit, as\r\nindicating anything but that the parties perceived the Agreement to\r\nbe binding.  In addition, GE del Caribe sent SECOMAN a fax\r\nratifying the Agreement, stating that Mr. Aranda \"is authorized by\r\nGE del Caribe to negotiate and conclude business deals such as the\r\none we have concluded on March 24 with your company.\"  (Emphasis\r\nsupplied).  GE del Caribe's decision to send SECOMAN a letter of\r\ncredit, albeit one that did not comply with the Agreement, also\r\ntends to undermine the claim that it did not consider the Agreement\r\nto have any binding force.\r\nSecond, the conclusion that the contract was specifically\r\none for the sale of cotton is supported by the text of the\r\nAgreement and by the testimony of the plaintiffs and their legal\r\nexperts, which the district court found credible.  For example, we\r\nperceive no error in the district court's determination that the\r\nclause stating that the \"[c]ost offered per pound: $1.58 USD\"\r\nprovided the sale price, or in the finding that the reference to\r\n1000 tons of cotton being available indicated that the quantity of\r\ncotton sold was 1000 tons.  The court heard testimony indicating\r\nthat these price and quantity terms were the terms of SECOMAN's\r\noffer, and that GE del Caribe accepted the offer by signing the\r\nAgreement.  The fact that the Agreement uses the terms \"cost\r\noffered\" and \"availability\" rather than \"price for sale\" and\r\n\"quantity sold\" does not necessarily imply that the Agreement was\r\nnot a contract of sale.  Moreover, the Agreement was typewritten by\r\na non-lawyer who, to judge from the fact that he could not wait\r\nuntil the following working day, was apparently in a hurry to close\r\nthe deal.  We thus find that there was sufficient evidence before\r\nthe court to allow it to conclude that the Agreement contained\r\nprice and quantity terms.\r\nSimilarly, the findings as to the delivery term are\r\nperfectly consistent with the Civil Code's default provisions.  SeeC. Civ. arts. 1552, 1553.  In particular, the Code provides that,\r\nabsent a stipulation to the contrary, a good is delivered by making\r\navailable to the buyer at the place where it is located.  See C.\r\nCiv. art. 1553.  Accordingly, SECOMAN's agreement to make the\r\ncotton available and ready to ship was sufficient to comply with\r\nits contractual obligation to deliver the cotton.\r\nThe district court also heard testimony indicating that\r\nMr. Aranda had mis-drafted the facilitation clause, erroneously\r\ntransposing the names of GE del Caribe and SECOMAN.  GE del Caribe\r\nargues that such testimony was inherently unreliable, since the\r\nresulting clause would be internally inconsistent.  We disagree. \r\nThe resulting clause would read as follows:\r\nThat GE del Caribe will use SELLERS as\r\nfacilitators and sales consultants during\r\nthis transaction.  SELLERS will not\r\nnegotiate sale of the lot aforementioned\r\nwithout the written agreement of GE del\r\nCaribe.\r\n\nThe district court's reading is not implausible.  Indeed, far from\r\nbeing internally incoherent, the resulting clause is consistent\r\nwith a contract whereby SECOMAN sells cotton to GE del Caribe,\r\nwhich then resells the cotton.  According to the district court's\r\nunderstanding of this aspect of the Agreement, although Mr. Aranda\r\nhad some potential buyers in mind, SECOMAN agreed to assist GE del\r\nCaribe in its efforts to resell the cotton because of its greater\r\nexpertise in the cotton market.  GE del Caribe, however, retained\r\nfinal authority to approve or reject any offer from a potential\r\nbuyer.  Given the evidence heard at trial, we cannot say that it\r\nwas clear error for the district court to find that this was the\r\ndeal agreed to by Mr. Aranda and Mr. Gordillo.\r\nFurthermore, it was not clear error for the district\r\ncourt to find that the Agreement required GE del Caribe to submit\r\na confirmed letter of credit, based on evidence that, as a matter\r\nof customary practice in international trade and finance, a letter\r\nof credit will not be treated as negotiable unless it is confirmed\r\nby a bank.  Based on this evidence, as well as on evidence that\r\nGE's policy is never to accept an unconfirmed letter of credit\r\nbecause it is not negotiable, the court also found that GE del\r\nCaribe knew of this customary practice and thus knew that the\r\nAgreement required the letter of credit to be confirmed.  We find\r\nthe evidence sufficient to support the court's conclusions.\r\nIn sum, GE del Caribe failed to show that the Agreement\r\nwas not a sales contract.  Although GE del Caribe presented some\r\nevidence to the contrary, the evidence on SECOMAN's side was not so\r\nunreliable as to make it unreasonable for the district court to\r\ngive it credit.  Moreover, although GE del Caribe has focused on\r\narguing that the Agreement was not a binding contract, it has also\r\nhinted that the Agreement might have been binding after all, but\r\nonly as part of a multilateral barter trade agreement, rather than\r\nas a simple contract of sale.  Admittedly, GE del Caribe's\r\nproposed interpretation of the Agreement is plausible, but it is\r\nnot our province to make findings of fact.  More importantly, even\r\nif the Agreement had been a barter trade contract, GE del Caribe\r\nfailed to show that it would not have required GE del Caribe to\r\nproduce the letter of credit.  Given that SECOMAN's cause of action\r\narises out of GE's willful failure to produce a negotiable letter\r\nof credit, it is unclear whether GE's proposed reading of the\r\nAgreement would lead to a different result in this case.\r\nFinally, we address GE del Caribe's argument that the\r\nAgreement was invalid because its purpose was unlawful.  Article\r\n1403 of the Civil Code provides that the \"obligation that is the\r\nobject of the contract must be legitimate.\"  We agree that under\r\nPeruvian law, a contract for an unlawful purpose is void.  However,\r\nas GE del Caribe admits, nothing on the face of the Agreement\r\nindicates that the Agreement had an illegal purpose.  Instead, GE\r\ndel Caribe's argument is based on the plaintiff's testimony\r\nindicating that SECOMAN requested payment in the form of a letter\r\nof credit so that it could circumvent Peru's foreign exchange and\r\ntax laws.  GE del Caribe specifically claims that SECOMAN violated\r\na Peruvian law that requires exporters to deposit any proceeds from\r\ntheir sales abroad in the government-owned Central Bank, which\r\nconverts the proceeds to Peruvian currency at a rate that is\r\nusually less favorable than the market exchange rate.\r\nAlthough the evidence did show that the purpose of\r\narranging for payment by means of a letter of credit was to permit\r\nSECOMAN to choose an advantageous time to convert the letter into\r\ncurrency, GE del Caribe has failed to establish that such a\r\nstrategy is, in fact, illegal under Peruvian law.  For example, it\r\nis not clear that the duty to deposit the proceeds from export\r\ntransactions extends to forms of payment other than payment in\r\ncurrency, such as payment by letter of credit.  Moreover, SECOMAN\r\npresented evidence that even when payment is made in currency, the\r\nduty to deposit the proceeds does not arise until the transaction\r\nis consummated.  Because SECOMAN had not shipped any cotton when GE\r\ndel Caribe breached the Agreement, it does not appear that SECOMAN\r\nwas yet under a duty to deposit the $100,000 in the Central Bank.\r\nB.  Damages\r\nReviewing the district court's findings as to damages for\r\nclear error, we find only one.  The district court's award of\r\ndamages to SECOMAN apparently failed to take into account the\r\n$100,000 that was paid up front to Mr. Gordillo as a deposit on the\r\nAgreement.  The district court did not make an explicit finding\r\nthat the deposit was not to be considered an advance on the payment\r\ndue under the Agreement, and we would consider any such finding to\r\nbe clearly erroneous.  We will therefore reduce the award of\r\ndamages contained in the district court's judgment by $100,000.\r\nWe reject, however, GE's contention that the award of\r\ndamages should be reduced by the amount of taxes that SECOMAN would\r\nhave had to pay on the proceeds from this sale.  Such a reduction\r\nmight have been in order only upon proof that SECOMAN would not be\r\nliable for payment of taxes on its award, see Atlas Truck Leasing,\r\nInc. v. First N.H. Banks, Inc., 808 F.2d 902, 905 (1st Cir. 1987),\r\nand no such proof was provided.\r\nWe also do not agree with GE del Caribe's argument that\r\nthe district court erred both in determining that GE del Caribe\r\nacted with dolus and in its calculation of damages.  A party acts\r\nwith dolus when that party willfully fails to perform an\r\nobligation.  See C. Civ. art. 1318.  A determination that a\r\nbreaching party acted with dolus has a substantial effect upon the\r\ndamages available to the injured party.  Any person breaching a\r\ncontract is \"responsible for compensating the losses and damages\r\n[proximately] caused by its failure to perform.\"  See C. Civ. art.\r\n1321.  However, a person who breaches a contract with dolus is also\r\nliable for any unforeseeable damages caused by the breach.  See id. \r\nGE del Caribe correctly states that a finding of dolus requires a\r\nfinding that the breaching party intentionally breached an\r\nobligation that it knew was binding, and that a court must analyze\r\nthe subjective intent of the breaching party in order to make a\r\nfinding of dolus.   \r\nIn its opinion, however, the district court found that GE\r\ndel Caribe \"knew that by failing to tender a negotiable letter of\r\ncredit, it was performing an act contrary to the contractual\r\nobligations it had assumed\" under the Agreement.  The court's\r\nconclusion was based on evidence indicating that SECOMAN had\r\ninformed GE del Caribe of its pressing need for the negotiable\r\nletter of credit, that at least some GE del Caribe employees were\r\naware that the Agreement required payment to be made by means of an\r\nirrevocable letter of credit, and that GE del Caribe was concerned\r\nabout the significant decline in the price of cotton.  The court\r\nalso found the letter sent by GE del Caribe on June 11, 1990, in\r\nwhich GE del Caribe claimed that SECOMAN's rejection of the terms\r\nof the letter of credit \"release[d] and excuse[d] [it] from any and\r\nall performance [under the Agreement],\"  to be evidence probative\r\nof bad faith.  In particular, the letter indicates that GE del\r\nCaribe felt the need to find a way to be released from the\r\nAgreement, which in turn supports the implication that it knew\r\nitself to be bound by the Agreement.  Reviewing these findings only\r\nfor clear error, with due deference to the trier of fact's greater\r\nability to gauge the demeanor and credibility of the witnesses, we\r\ncannot say that the district court's findings were clearly\r\nerroneous.\r\nGE del Caribe also raised several other challenges to the\r\ndistrict court's calculation of damages, including claims that the\r\ncourt should have reduced the award of damages by the amount by\r\nwhich the Peruvian foreign exchange restrictions would have reduced\r\nSECOMAN's profits, that the court should not have based its award\r\nof damages on the assumption that SECOMAN had actually purchased\r\n1000 tons of cotton, that there was no evidence from which the\r\ncourt could conclude that SECOMAN suffered losses on \"cover sales,\"\r\nthat the court failed to deduct $200,000 attributable to Mr. Manuel\r\nBentin's partial ownership of the cotton, and that the court should\r\nnot have compensated SECOMAN for the liability it incurred when it\r\nbreached two subsequent contracts for the sale of cotton.  We\r\naffirm the district court on these points, substantially for the\r\nreasons expressed in its opinion.\r\nC.  Attorney's Fees\r\nGE del Caribe contends that the district court's award\r\nunder P.R. R. Civ. P. 44.1(d) was erroneous because Puerto Rico law\r\nwas inapplicable to this case.  In the alternative, GE del Caribe\r\nclaims that, even if Rule 44 were applicable to this case, the\r\ndistrict court abused its discretion in finding that GE del Caribe\r\nhad litigated in an obstinate manner.  We disagree with both\r\nclaims.\r\nIn general terms, a federal court sitting in diversity\r\napplies the substantive law of the forum state and federal\r\nprocedural rules.  See 28 U.S.C.  2072 (the \"Rules Enabling Act\");\r\nErie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 78 (1938); Woods-Leber v.\r\nHyatt Hotels of P.R., Inc., 124 F.3d 47, 50 (1st Cir. 1997).  A\r\nstate law \"that would be controlling in an action upon the same\r\nclaim by the same parties in a State court\" is substantive for Eriepurposes if it would \"significantly affect the result of a\r\nlitigation for a federal court to disregard it.\"  Guaranty Trust\r\nCo. v. York, 326 U.S. 99, 109 (1945).  It has long been the law in\r\nthis circuit that P.R. R. Civ. P. 44.1 is substantive for Eriepurposes.  See Dopp v. Pritzker, 38 F.3d 1239, 1252 (1st Cir.\r\n1994); Pan Am. World Airways, Inc. v. Ramos, 357 F.2d 341, 342 (1st\r\nCir. 1966).  State conflict of laws rules are also considered\r\nsubstantive for purposes of the Erie doctrine.  See David &amp;\r\nZimmermann, Inc. v. Challoner, 423 U.S. 3, 4 (1975); Klaxon v.\r\nStentor Elec. Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487, 496 (1941); New Ponce\r\nShopping Ctr. v. Integrand Assurance Co., 86 F.3d 265, 267 (1st\r\nCir. 1996).  The courts of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico have\r\nconsistently followed the choice of law rules laid out in the\r\nRestatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws.  See, e.g., Efectos\r\nLitogrficos, C.A. v. National Paper &amp; Type Co. of P.R., 112 P.R.\r\nDec. 389, 396-97 (1982); Partido Popular Democrtico v. Barreto-\r\nPrez, 111 P.R. Dec. 199, 256 (1981); Archilla v. Smyth Worldwide\r\nMovers, Inc., 106 P.R. Dec. 538, 550 (1977); Green Giant Co. v.\r\nTribunal Superior, 104 P.R. Dec. 489, 499 (1975); Fernndez vda. de\r\nFornaris v. American Surety Co. of N.Y., 93 P.R. Dec. 29, 48\r\n(1966).  Pursuant to section 122 of the Restatement, \"[a] court\r\nusually applies its own local law rules prescribing how litigation\r\nshall be conducted even when it applies the local law rules of\r\nanother state to resolve other issues in the case.\"  Restatement\r\n(Second) of Conflict of Laws  122 (1969).\r\nGE's contention is that Rule 44.1 is applicable only in\r\nthose diversity cases in which the merits of the controversy are\r\ndetermined on the basis of the substantive law of Puerto Rico.  GE\r\ndel Caribe concludes that, since Puerto Rico's conflict of laws\r\nrules establish that Peruvian law governs the underlying dispute,\r\nRule 44.1 is inapplicable to this case.\r\nGE's argument is based upon the erroneous premise that if\r\na particular state law is \"substantive\" for purposes of Erieanalysis, it must also be substantive for purposes of conflict of\r\nlaws analysis.  To the contrary, the U.S. Supreme Court has\r\n\"reject[ed] the notion that there is an equivalence between what is\r\nsubstantive under Erie doctrine and what is substantive for\r\npurposes of conflict of laws.\"  Sun Oil Co. v. Wortman, 486 U.S.\r\n717, 722 (1988) (citing Guaranty Trust Co., 326 U.S. at 108).  As\r\nthe Court explained in Sun Oil, \r\nExcept at the extremes, the terms\r\n\"substance\" and \"procedure\" describe very\r\nlittle except a dichotomy, and what they\r\nmean in a particular context is largely\r\ndetermined by the purposes for which the\r\ndichotomy is drawn.  In the context of our\r\nErie jurisprudence, . . . that purpose is\r\nto establish (within the limits of\r\napplicable federal law, including the\r\nprescribed Rules of Federal Procedure)\r\nsubstantial uniformity of predictable\r\noutcomes between cases tried in a federal\r\ncourt and cases tried in the courts of the\r\nState in which the federal court sits.  \r\n\n486 U.S. at 726-27.  In the conflict of laws context, in contrast,\r\nthe traditional substance-procedure dichotomy sought to reflect the\r\nrelative interests of both the forum and of the foreign\r\njurisdiction in having their law be applied to a case involving\r\nboth forum and foreign law.  See Restatement (Second) of Conflict\r\nof Laws  122 cmts. a, b (1969); see generally James W. Moore,\r\nMoore's Federal Practice  0.310[1] at 3129-30 (1996).  In fact,\r\nthe Restatement notes that characterizations of laws as\r\n\"substantive\" or \"procedural,\" \r\n[W]hile harmless in themselves, have led\r\nsome courts into unthinking adherence to\r\nprecedents that have classified a given\r\nissue as 'procedural' or 'substantive,'\r\nregardless of what purposes were involved\r\nin the earlier classifications. . . .  To\r\navoid encouraging errors of that sort, the\r\nrules stated in [the Restatement] do not\r\nattempt to classify issues as 'procedural'\r\nor 'substantive.'  Instead they face\r\ndirectly the question whether the forum's\r\nrule should be applied.\r\n\nRestatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws  122 cmt. b (1969).\r\nIn cases involving the law of a state or country other\r\nthan the forum state, therefore, a district court sitting in\r\ndiversity must engage in a two-step inquiry.  First, the district\r\ncourt determines whether a particular matter is procedural or\r\nsubstantive for Erie purposes.  If the matter is procedural,\r\nfederal law is applied, and if substantive, the court follows the\r\nlaw of the forum state.  Second, if a choice of law must be made,\r\nfor example, because a contractual choice-of-law clause is at issue\r\nor because a tort was committed in another jurisdiction, the\r\ndistrict court applies the law that would be applied under the\r\nconflict of laws rules of the forum state.  However, \"[i]n\r\ndetermining whether any state law will be adopted, the fact that a\r\nmatter is characterized as substantive by the state courts for\r\nchoice of law purposes does not connote that it will also be\r\nsubstantive for purposes of Erie, and the converse should be true.\" \r\nMaryland Cas. Co. v. Williams, 377 F.2d 389, 393 n.1 (5th Cir.\r\n1967).  Contrary to GE's contention, therefore, the fact that Rule\r\n44.1 is considered \"substantive\" for Erie purposes does not bar a\r\nfinding that it is \"procedural\" for conflict of laws purposes.\r\nTurning to the case at hand, we are faced with the\r\nquestion whether, pursuant to section 122 of the Restatement, the\r\ncourts of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico would apply Rule 44.1 in\r\na suit otherwise subject to the laws of another state or country. \r\nAlthough we have found no Puerto Rico decision directly on point,\r\nwe are confident that the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico would\r\nconclude that Rule 44.1 is a \"local law rule[] prescribing how\r\nlitigation shall be conducted.\"  Restatement (Second) of Conflict\r\nof Laws  122.  Rule 44.1 does not modify the parties' substantive\r\nrights under the law.  Instead, it serves the institutional\r\nconcerns of the courts by allowing the imposition of sanctions upon\r\nparties who abuse the judicial process.  After all, \"[t]he purpose\r\nbehind [Rules 44.1 and 44.3] is to penalize 'a losing party that\r\nbecause of his stubbornness, obstinacy, rashness, and insistent\r\nfrivolous attitude has forced the other party to needlessly assume\r\nthe pains, costs, efforts, and inconveniences of a litigation.'\" \r\nDopp, 38 F.3d at 1253 (quoting Fernndez v. San Juan Cement Co.,\r\n118 P.R. Dec. 713, 718 (1987)).\r\nOur conclusion is reinforced by an evaluation of the four\r\nfactors listed by the Restatement to be taken into consideration in\r\nmaking this determination: (1) \"whether the issue is one to which\r\nthe parties are likely to have given thought in the course of\r\nentering into the transaction\"; (2) \"whether the issue is one whose\r\nresolution would be likely to affect the ultimate result in this\r\ncase\"; (3) \"whether the precedents have tended consistently to\r\nclassify the issue as 'procedural' or 'substantive' for choice-of-\r\nlaw purposes\"; and (4) \"whether an effort to apply the rules of the\r\njudicial administration of another state would impose an undue\r\nburden upon the forum.\"  See Restatement (Second) of Conflict of\r\nLaws  122 cmt. a.  \r\nFirst, there is no evidence whatsoever that the parties\r\nintended to exclude the applicability of Rule 44.1, or to make\r\napplicable to this case the litigation rules of another forum. \r\nSecond, we do not agree that \"the issue is one whose resolution is\r\nlikely to affect the ultimate result of the case,\" Restatement\r\n(Second) of Conflict of Laws  122 cmt. a, because, although the\r\nimposition of sanctions under Rule 44.1 does entail the payment of\r\na monetary penalty, the penalty is not a remedy arising out of the\r\ncause of action.  Third, laws providing for awards of attorneys'\r\nfees have not been consistently classified as either \"procedural\"\r\nor \"substantive\" for choice-of-law purposes, either in Puerto Rico\r\nor elsewhere.  Compare Du-Wel Prods. v. United States Fire Ins.,\r\n565 A.2d 1113, 1120 (N.J. Super. 1990) (Michigan counsel fee law\r\nheld procedural and therefore inapplicable to suit brought in New\r\nJersey state court), with Aries v. Palmer Johnson, Inc., 735 P.2d\r\n1373, 1380 (Ariz. App. 1987) (Arizona law providing for award of\r\nattorney's fees was substantive); cf. Arno v. Club Med Boutique,\r\nInc., 134 F.3d 1424, 1425-26 (9th Cir. 1998) (leaning toward\r\ntreating fees issue as procedural, but noting that some courts have\r\nheld the contrary).\r\nFourth, \"an effort to apply the rules of the judicial\r\nadministration of\" Peru \"would impose an undue burden upon the\"\r\ncourts in Puerto Rico.  Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws\r\n122 cmt. a.  For example, this court has not been able to\r\ndetermine what the Peruvian law of civil procedure would provide in\r\na situation such as the one at hand.  In any case, Peruvian civil\r\nprocedure is not as easily transplanted as its substantive law of\r\nobligations and contracts.\r\nFinding that the district court did not err as a matter\r\nof law in determining that GE del Caribe's conduct in this case\r\nshould evaluated under Rule 44.1, we turn next to the question\r\nwhether the district court abused its discretion in determining\r\nthat GE del Caribe behaved in a manner deserving of sanctions under\r\nthat rule.  See Dopp, 38 F.3d at 1253 (explaining that appellate\r\nreview of orders imposing sanctions under Rule 44.1 is for abuse of\r\ndiscretion).  Rule 44.1(d) provides, in pertinent part: \"In the\r\nevent any party or its lawyer has acted obstinately or frivolously,\r\nthe court shall, in its judgment, impose on such person the payment\r\nof a sum for attorney's fees which the court decides corresponds to\r\nsuch conduct.\"  \"The purpose behind [Rule 44.1] is to penalize 'a\r\nlosing party that because of his stubbornness, obstinacy, rashness,\r\nand insistent frivolous attitude has forced the other party to\r\nneedlessly assume the pains, costs, efforts, and inconveniences of\r\na litigation.'\"  Dopp, 38 F.3d at 1253 (quoting Fernndez v. San\r\nJuan Cement Co., 118 P.R. Dec. 713, 718 (1987)).  For the reasons\r\nalready discussed above, we have affirmed the district court's\r\ndetermination that GE del Caribe breached its obligations under the\r\nAgreement in bad faith.  A finding of bad faith implies that GE del\r\nCaribe was aware that it was breaching its obligations under the\r\nAgreement when, in June 1990, it attempted unilaterally to\r\nterminate the Agreement.  We thus find no abuse of discretion in\r\nthe district court's further conclusion that GE del Caribe's\r\ncomplete denial of liability, by forcing the plaintiffs and the\r\ncourt to undergo the expense of litigating a full trial, was an\r\nobstinate posture deserving of sanctions under Rule 44.1.\r\nIV.  Conclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's\r\njudgment on the issue of liability, but reduce the award of damages\r\nby $100,000.  Furthermore, we affirm the district court's\r\nimposition of sanctions under P.R. R. Civ. P. 44.1.  Costs are\r\nawarded to appellees.\r\n",

Defendant General Electric del Caribe, Inc.

(\"SECOMAN\"), a Peruvian partnership.  Following a bench trial, the district court found for SECOMAN, awarded damages for loss of profits caused by the breach, and ordered GE del Caribe to pay a portion of SECOMAN's attorneys' fees as a sanction under P.R. R. Civ. P. 44.1 for its obstinate conduct during litigation.  GE del Caribe appeals the finding of breach, the determination of damages, and the imposition of sanctions.  We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recite the facts in the light most favorable to the district court's findings of fact.  See Wainwright Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Boulos, 89 F.3d 17, 18 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SECOMAN had been engaged in the purchase and resale of Tanguis cotton since its founding in 1977.  Until 1989, SECOMAN was licensed to sell cotton only inside Peru.  At that time, SECOMAN attempted to enter the international cotton market, first by obtaining a license to export cotton from Peru, and then by entering into a joint venture with another Peruvian business to buy cotton and resell it on the international market.  The joint venture focused on Pima rather than Tanguis cotton because Pima cotton is of higher quality and is generally in greater demand.  Moreover, at the time there was a substantial differential between the price at which Pima cotton could be purchased from cotton producers in Peru and the international market price.  In order to build a stock of cotton for export, SECOMAN obtained lines of credit, totaling $2,000,000, from various Peruvian banks.  In the fall of 1989, SECOMAN began to purchase Pima cotton.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GE del Caribe, a corporation organized under the laws of Puerto Rico, is a subsidiary of the GE Supply Company, based in Connecticut, which is in turn a division of the General Electric Company.  As its name suggests, GE del Caribe is engaged in the sale of General Electric products in the Caribbean, Central America, and South America.  Mr. Enrique Aranda, a Peruvian national, was the president of GE del Caribe from 1986 to 1993.  In 1990, he was trying to increase his company's sales by penetrating different Latin American markets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1990, Mr. Aranda spoke with a friend in Peru, Mr. Huertas del Pino, who was the president of Carmel Export Agency, Inc.  (\"Carmel\"), and who informed him that through his contacts there, he could facilitate GE del Caribe's expansion into that market.  In particular, Mr. Huertas had a business relationship with Horizon Trading, Inc.  (\"Horizon\"), a Peruvian entity established in the Cayman Islands and engaged in the export of Peruvian products.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Around the same time, Horizon was informed that there was a seller on the market ready to provide 1,000 tons of Pima cotton for sale at $1.70 per pound, and that the seller was willing to pay a commission on the sale.  Horizon communicated this information, as well as the fact that the international price for Pima cotton was $2.40 per pound, to Mr. Huertas, who replied that he believed that he could find a buyer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That person was Mr. Aranda.  Mr. Huertas arranged for a meeting to take place in Peru between Mr. Aranda and several Peruvian businessmen who were interested in exporting cotton and other Peruvian products.  In preparation for the meeting, Mr. Aranda requested that both Mr. Huertas and a GE del Caribe employee provide him with information regarding the cotton market.  He received samples of SECOMAN's Pima cotton, and began to research the possibility of reselling the cotton abroad.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The meeting was held on Friday, March 23, 1990, at the Caesar's Palace Hotel in Lima, Peru.  Among those present was Mr. Alfredo Gordillo, general manager and 90% owner of SECOMAN.  At the meeting, Mr. Aranda told Mr. Gordillo that he was interested in purchasing the cotton that SECOMAN had in stock.  Although Mr. Gordillo was offering only 600 tons, when asked whether he could supply more he stated that he could export up to a total of 1,000 tons, at $1.72 per pound.  After the meeting, Mr. Aranda called Mr. Gordillo and insisted that the two of them meet again the following day to discuss the transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the second meeting, held in Mr. Gordillo's office, Mr. Aranda and Mr. Gordillo negotiated the details of an agreement pursuant to which GE del Caribe would purchase 1,000 tons of Pima cotton from SECOMAN.  Among other things, Mr. Gordillo agreed to Mr. Aranda's request that the asking price be reduced to $1.58 per pound.  Payment was to be made by a negotiable letter of credit, with a face value of $2,800,000, which would be submitted to SECOMAN for its approval.  GE del Caribe was also to make an initial deposit of $100,000 in Mr. Gordillo's account in a Miami, Florida bank.  As they had discussed the day before, SECOMAN had 600 tons of Pima cotton in stock and ready to ship immediately.  Mr. Aranda agreed to allow SECOMAN an additional two weeks to purchase and ship the extra 400 tons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Gordillo also asked Mr. Aranda whether he had pre-sold the cotton.  Mr. Aranda replied that he had not, but that he had some prospects.  Mr. Aranda asked Mr. Gordillo for the names of some of SECOMAN's clients, which Mr. Gordillo agreed to do if Mr. Aranda's prospective buyers did not purchase the cotton.  Mr. Gordillo also offered SECOMAN's services as a sales agent for GE del Caribe, given SECOMAN's greater expertise in the cotton market.  Mr. Aranda agreed, but only on condition that SECOMAN not offer the same cotton for sale without GE's prior written authorization.  Finally, Mr. Gordillo asked Mr. Aranda to have GE del Caribe confirm his authority to enter into the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because it was a Saturday, Mr. Gordillo did not have secretarial assistance in the office, and he therefore suggested that the agreement be drafted at a later date.  Mr. Aranda stated, however, that he would rather have a document drafted immediately, and then proceeded to type up the substance of their agreements in English in a document entitled \"Agreement to Purchase\" (\"Agreement\").  Both of them then signed the Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Initially, the parties began to perform their respective duties under the Agreement.  Thus, on March 29, 1990, GE's Vice President of Finance sent a letter by facsimile to SECOMAN ratifying the Agreement, indicating that Mr. Aranda was \"authorized by GE del Caribe to negotiate and conclude business deals such as the one we have concluded on March 24 with [SECOMAN].\"  On April 20, 1990, GE del Caribe deposited the agreed-upon $100,000 in Mr. Gordillo's bank account.  SECOMAN, in the meantime, began purchasing additional Pima cotton to comply with its duty to provide a total of 1,000 tons of cotton.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Aranda had also immediately begun to seek buyers for the cotton at $1.90 per pound.  However, by April 5, 1990, he had not yet found any buyers, so on that day he wrote to SECOMAN indicating that the sale of the cotton was taking longer than foreseen and requesting an additional eight working days to conclude the sale.  At the same time, Mr. Huertas was also negotiating the sale of 1,000 tons of Pima cotton at $1.90 per pound.  Mr. Huertas also required the prospective buyer to make a $100,000 deposit.  Although Mr. Huertas claimed that it was merely a coincidence that he was offering Pima cotton for sale on the same terms as GE del Caribe, the district court found that Mr. Huertas had no cotton of his own, but was instead helping Mr. Aranda to find a buyer for the cotton that GE del Caribe had purchased from SECOMAN.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Throughout the late spring and early summer of 1990, the international market price for Pima cotton was steadily dropping, dooming Mr. Aranda's efforts to sell the cotton that GE del Caribe had purchased from SECOMAN.  For example, on May 14, 1990, Mr. Aranda contacted again a potential purchaser who had offered to buy the cotton at $1.70 per pound, but had originally been turned down because GE del Caribe was asking for $1.90 per pound.  Even though Mr. Aranda lowered the sale price to $1.73 per pound, the offeree rejected the offer noting that the world price had dropped even further.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In mid-April, Mr. Aranda began to visit banks in Puerto Rico to obtain the letter of credit that was due under the Agreement. At that time, he had not yet informed his superiors of his trip to Peru, of the existence of the Agreement, or of his efforts to sell the cotton.  The banks, however, would not issue a letter of credit without a guarantee, or \"letter of comfort,\" from GE's parent company.  Therefore, in early May, Mr. Aranda sought the assistance of his superiors in GE Supply Co., explaining that GE del Caribe needed the letter of comfort in order to obtain the letter of credit that SECOMAN was to receive pursuant to the Agreement.  He also explained that GE del Caribe stood to gain $300,000 on the sale of the cotton.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Aranda's superiors, however, refused to issue the letter of comfort, instructed him not to comply further with the Agreement, and began to investigate the matter.  On May 23, 1990, Mr. James Ambrose, who was the Chairman of the Board of Directors of GE del Caribe as well as an officer in GE Supply, flew to Puerto Rico to discuss the Agreement with Mr. Aranda.  Mr. Ambrose expressed his displeasure over the fact that Mr. Aranda had committed GE del Caribe to this transaction without the approval of the Board of Directors.  At its next meeting, the Board reprimanded Mr. Aranda for his actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that from that point on, GE del Caribe sought ways to shirk its duties under the contract.  In particular, after much delay, GE del Caribe sent SECOMAN a revocable letter of credit.  SECOMAN rejected the proffered letter and requested, instead, a confirmed, irrevocable letter of credit.  On June 11, 1990, GE del Caribe wrote to SECOMAN claiming that SECOMAN's rejection of the proffered letters was an essential breach of the contract that entitled GE del Caribe to resolve the Agreement.  However, the district court determined that SECOMAN had not breached any obligation in rejecting the revocable letter of credit, since such a letter did not satisfy the requirement, imposed by the Agreement, that GE del Caribe produce a negotiable letter of credit because only irrevocable letters of credit can be negotiable.  The district court further determined that GE del Caribe's violation of this aspect of the contract was willful and in bad faith, since it knew that the Agreement required that the letter of credit be irrevocable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GE del Caribe's initial delay and eventual failure to procure an irrevocable letter of credit not only deprived SECOMAN of its expected profit on the Pima cotton transaction, but also started a chain reaction that devastated SECOMAN's finances.  GE del Caribe's failure to tender a negotiable letter of credit rendered SECOMAN unable to meet its obligations under the lines of credit it had opened the year before.  SECOMAN was then reported to the Superintendent of Banks and Insurance of Peru for its failure to meet these obligations and placed on a list of defaulting entities.  The listing prevented SECOMAN from obtaining any further financing, which in turn prevented SECOMAN from purchasing the additional cotton that it was required to deliver under two different contracts with other parties.  Because of its breach of its obligations under these contracts, the buyers filed demands for arbitration against SECOMAN.  Awards were entered against SECOMAN in both arbitrations.  Thus, in addition to losing its expected profits on those contracts, SECOMAN was ordered to pay damages to the buyers.  Finally, the cumulative effect of these losses was to reduce SECOMAN's value as a going concern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SECOMAN subsequently filed suit against GE del Caribe for breach of contract in the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, alleging alienage jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a)(2).  Before trial, the parties stipulated that their dispute was governed by Peruvian law.  After an extensive bench trial, the district court determined that GE del Caribe had not only breached the Agreement, but also that it had done so with \"dolo\" or dolus--that is, in bad faith.  Under Peruvian contract law, a defendant who breaches a contract in bad faith is liable for all damages proximately caused by the breach, including unforeseeable damages.  See Cdigo Civil (C. Civ.) art.  1321 (Peru).  Accordingly, the district court's award of damages to SECOMAN included its loss of profits on the sale of cotton to GE del Caribe, as well as all other losses it suffered as a consequence of the breach.  Finally, the district court required GE del Caribe to pay a certain portion of SECOMAN's attorney's fees, as a sanction for GE's obstinate conduct.  GE del Caribe then filed the appeal that is now before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

Analysis</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Breach of Contract</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GE del Caribe contends that the district court erred in determining that it breached its obligations under the \"Agreement to Purchase,\" for the simple reason that the Agreement was not a final and binding contract under the law of Peru.  In support of its claim, GE del Caribe points out three different flaws in the Agreement that arguably prevent it from being a binding contract.  First, GE del Caribe claims that the Agreement fails to comply with C. Civ. art. 1359, which provides that \"[n]o contract exists as long as the parties do not agree with all of its stipulations, even if the discrepancy is secondary,\" because the Agreement lacks an undertaking to purchase, a price term, a delivery term, and an agreement on the terms for the letter of credit.  Second, GE del Caribe contends that the district court's reliance on evidence extrinsic to the Agreement, particularly in determining that the Agreement's \"facilitation\" clause contained a drafting error, was ultra vires because, under Peruvian law, a court may not use extrinsic evidence to interpret a contract, let alone to rewrite its clear and unambiguous terms.  Third, and finally, GE del Caribe asserts that the district court erred in rejecting GE del Caribe's argument that the Agreement was invalid because its purpose was unlawful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1. Conclusions of Law</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its first two arguments, GE del Caribe implicitly contends that the district court erred both by failing to apply correctly the rules of contractual hermeneutics required by the Peruvian Civil Code, and by finding ambiguity in the terms of the contract when there was none.  However, GE del Caribe's arguments are also based in part on claims that the district court misapprehended the evidence.  As we discussed above, we review de novo the district court's determinations of Peruvian law and of the ambiguousness of the terms of the Agreement, but we review the court's findings of fact only for clear error.  For the sake of clarity and convenience, we first address the questions of law and of contractual hermeneutics, and only then pass on to evaluate the district court's findings of fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>a. Terms of the Agreement</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GE del Caribe's first argument begins with the claim that C. Civ. art. 1359 establishes that there can be no contract if the parties have not reached an agreement as to every element of the contract, whether primary or secondary.  This assumes that a lack of agreement as to any contractual terms, as opposed to a disagreement, is enough to prevent a contract from arising.  Contending that the Agreement lacked an undertaking to purchase and reflected no agreement on price, date of delivery, or the essential terms of the letter of credit, GE del Caribe concludes that there was no contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GE del Caribe's argument is subtly but seriously flawed.  The fundamental problem is that, contrary to GE's assertions, Article 1359 does not require the affirmative agreement of the parties as to each and every term of a contract.  Instead, Article 1359 distinguishes between essential and non-essential terms, requiring affirmative agreement as to essential terms, but merely requiring that there be no disagreement as to non-essential terms.  See Manuel de la Puente y Lavalle, El Contrato en General [Contracts in General ], Pt. 1, Tome 1, at 397-98 (Lima, Peru 1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Silence as to an essential term is fatal;  that is to say, there can be no contract unless the parties have affirmatively agreed to the essential terms of the contract.  The crucial problem is determining which terms are essential and which are not.  As one commentator has noted, some terms are objectively essential, while others are only subjectively essential.  See id. at 392.   Objectively essential terms are those elements of a contract that are made necessary by the very nature of the contract, without regard to the parties' subjective intent.  See id.   Of course, the difficulty of the task of determining which elements are objectively essential depends on the type of contract involved:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>Notwithstanding that it is relatively difficult to establish, as a general rule, just which are the essential terms of each [type of] contract, the task is easier when it involves those types of contracts that are defined by law, such as the contracts [ ] defined in the Peruvian Civil Code....  Thus, for example, insofar as Article 1529 of the Code defines the contract of sale as the contract whereby a seller binds himself to transfer the ownership of a good to a buyer, and the latter to pay a price in money, the essential terms of that contract are the good and the price.  ...  The problem is more delicate with regard to atypical contracts, in which, because of a lack of [legislative] definition, it is hardly possible to determine which contractual obligations are essential and which are secondary....  [I]t is therefore necessary to analyze, case by case, the business purpose of the contract so as to determine which obligations are indispensable for its success:  such obligations will constitute the essential elements of the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">M. de la Puente y Lavalle, El Contrato en General [Contracts in General ], Pt. 1, Tome 1, at 392 (emphasis supplied).  Subjectively essential terms, in contrast, are those which, even though they are not objectively essential, are deemed to be essential by the contracting parties.  See id.   For example, although a delivery term is not objectively essential to a contract of sale (for reasons discussed below), the parties to such a contract may very well consider these essential to the negotiations.  The question whether a particular term is subjectively essential presents a issue of fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Silence with regard to non-essential terms, in contrast, is not fatal because the Civil Code's norms regarding contracts \"are suppletory to the will of the parties, save for those that are imperative.\"   C. Civ. art. 1356.  Article 1356 must be read in conjunction with C. Civ. art. 1354, which, in stating that \"[t]he parties may freely determine the content of a contract, so long as it is not contrary to any imperative legal norms,\" establishes a distinction between the imperative and optional provisions of the Civil Code.  Optional norms are presumed to apply to a given contract, but parties may elect otherwise, whereas the parties may not opt out of imperative norms.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Stated differently, a contract is subject to all imperative norms, as well as any optional norms not excluded by the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the parties' silence as to any non-essential term is not fatal under Article 1359 because the Code's optional norms provide the missing terms.  In contrast, if rather than silence we find disagreement as to any such term, then there can be no contract, because the fact that there is a dispute over a given term rebuts the presumption that the parties would consent to the incorporation of the Code's suppletory norms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted before, GE del Caribe claims that the Agreement to purchase was not a contract because it lacked an undertaking to purchase, a price term, a delivery term, and an agreement on the terms for the letter of credit.  The claim fails, for a variety of reasons.  With regard to the two essential terms that GE del Caribe contends were missing, these were found by the district court to be present.  For example, the alleged lack of an explicit undertaking to purchase is irrelevant because the district court found that such an undertaking was implicit in the Agreement.  Similarly, the district court found that the line in the Agreement stating \"Cost offered per pound:  $1.58 USD\" was an explicit price term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lack of an explicit agreement on the time and place of delivery does not prevent a contract from arising in this case.  The delivery term is not objectively essential to a contract of sale because C. Civ. arts. 1552 and 1553 provide default rules governing the time and place of delivery.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Moreover, there is no evidence on the record that the delivery term was subjectively essential, and articles 1552 and 1553 are not excluded either explicitly or implicitly by the terms of the Agreement to Purchase.  Consequently, these provisions are applicable to this contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the argument based on the letter of credit is also unconvincing.  The method of payment is not an objectively essential term of a contract of sale.  Moreover, although the parties to a sales contract could consider the method of payment to be subjectively essential, there is no indication that such was the case here.  In particular, reviewing the text of the Agreement,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> we find no stipulation that the content of the letter was to be the sine qua non of the Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The specific content and format of the letter of credit were thus secondary, non-essential terms of the Agreement.  As discussed above, only disagreement as to such terms is fatal under Article 1359.  The problem here is that the text of the Agreement does not indicate the existence of a disagreement, or even that the parties agreed to leave the specifics of the letter of credit open for future negotiation.  Specifically, it is not clear to us that the requirement that a draft of the letter be submitted to SECOMAN for its approval necessarily means that the parties had not already agreed upon the content of the letter.  To the contrary, the requirement may very well have been intended merely to allow SECOMAN the opportunity to ensure that the letter of credit was drafted in accordance with the terms already agreed upon.  Accordingly, it fell upon GE del Caribe to prove to the district court by a preponderance of the evidence that the parties had agreed to postpone their negotiation over the details of the letter of credit.  The district court, however, found that GE del Caribe failed to carry that burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>b. Redrafting of the \"facilitation\" clause and consideration</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>of extrinsic evidence</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The clause in question states:  \"The SELLERS guarantee the following:  ... That the SELLERS will use GE del Caribe as facilitators and sales consultants during this transaction.  SELLERS will not negotiate sale of the lot aforementioned without the written agreement of GE del Caribe.\"   The district court found that this clause was not consistent with the most natural reading of the rest of the Agreement, which otherwise seemed to be a contract for the sale of cotton.  Moreover, SECOMAN presented evidence that the \"facilitation\" clause had been incorrectly drafted by Mr. Aranda, because the actual agreement between Mr. Gordillo and himself provided that SECOMAN would act as facilitator and sales consultant for GE del Caribe, not the other way around.  The district court believed this evidence, and ruled accordingly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GE del Caribe claims, however, that Peruvian law prohibits courts from using extrinsic evidence to rewrite the clear and unambiguous terms of an agreement, and therefore that the district court's determination that the Agreement's \"facilitation\" clause contained a drafting error was ultra vires.   Although agreeing with the court that the \"facilitation\" clause was not consistent with the view that the Agreement was a contract of sale, GE del Caribe argues that the clause means what it says, that the court could not ignore the inconsistency, and thus that the only legally permissible conclusion to be drawn from the inconsistency was that the Agreement was not a contract of sale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GE del Caribe is correct in stating that Peruvian law does not permit a court to rewrite the clear and unambiguous terms of a contract;  however, Peruvian law does permit a court to inquire into the common intention of the parties if the terms of the contract are unclear or ambiguous.  Contrary to GE del Caribe's assertion, several of the Agreement's provisions are ambiguous and confusing.  The source of the problem is evident.  GE del Caribe's argument is premised on the erroneous assumption that a contractual provision is ambiguous only when its words are literally unclear.  To the contrary, contractual provisions may be ambiguous, even if their words are otherwise clear, if their meaning is placed in question by the context in which they are found.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to explain our conclusion, we review some basic concepts of Peruvian contractual hermeneutics.  Pursuant to C. Civ. art. 1352, \"[c]ontracts are perfected by the consent of the parties, except for those which, in addition, must observe the form required by law under penalty of nullity.\"   Thus, Peruvian law does not require any particular form for contracts, except for certain specific types of contracts that are not relevant here.  Instead, the Peruvian Civil Code contains a number of provisions designed to guide the parties (and the courts) in the interpretation of contracts, no matter what their form.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most basic of these provisions are C. Civ. arts. 168, 169, and 170, which regulate the interpretation of all \"juridical acts,\" including contracts.  In particular, Article 168 provides that \"[a] legal act must be interpreted in accordance with its content and with the principle of good faith,\" Article 169 provides that \"[a] clause in a legal act is interpreted in the light of the other clauses, and those clauses which are dubious are ascribed the meaning arising from the whole,\" and Article 170 provides that \"[s]tatements that have several meanings must be understood to have the meaning that is most suitable to the nature and object of the legal act.\"   In addition, there are a number of hermeneutic rules that are specifically applicable to contracts.  For example, C. Civ. art. 1361 provides that \"[c]ontracts are binding as to what is expressed in them.  It is presumed that the statements expressed in a contract reflect the common will of the parties, and whomever denies [that the statements do reflect the common will] must prove it.\"   Moreover, C. Civ. art. 1362 emphasizes that \"[c]ontracts must be negotiated, executed, and performed according to the rules of good faith and the common intent of the parties.\"   The principle of good faith has been interpreted to imply, among other things, the principle of conservation of contracts, which requires that contracts be interpreted whenever possible in such a way as to preserve their validity.  See Manuel Miranda-Canales, Derecho de los Contratos [The Law of Contracts ], at 33-34 (Lima, Peru 1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As GE del Caribe correctly states, the theory underlying these provisions is known as the objectivist theory of interpretation.  See Fernando Vidal-Ramrez, Tratado de Derecho Civil [Treatise on Civil Law ], Tome III, Vol.  I, at 395 (Lima, Peru 1990);  see generally M. de la Puente y Lavalle, El Contrato en General, Pt. 1, Tome 1, at 121-52 (from which much of the following discussion is derived).  However, GE's interpretation of the objectivist approach is incorrect.  As noted above, although under Peruvian law a contract is perfected by the consent of the parties, see C. Civ. art. 1352, consent as a mere subjective mental state has no legal effect.  Instead, some outward sign of consent, some declaration of the common will of the parties is required.  Unfortunately, the possibility then arises that the declaration of will may not accurately reflect the subjective common will of the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Various theories have been developed in order to resolve the problems that may be caused by this discrepancy.  The two most influential theories, the subjectivist and the objectivist, seem also to be diametrically opposed to each other.  The subjectivist theory requires the parties to subjectively consent to the contract, and treats the declaration of will merely as evidence of the subjective will of the parties.  In contrast, pursuant to the pure version of the objectivist theory, the declaration of will prevails over the subjective common will of the parties, so that if the declaration appears to indicate that the parties consented to the contract, the contract will be upheld even if the parties had not, in fact, had the requisite subjective intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although GE del Caribe claims that Peru has adopted the \"pure\" version of the objectivist theory, that is clearly not the case.  To the contrary, the provisions of the Peruvian Civil Code reflect a less strict version of the objectivist theory, sometimes referred to as the \"reliance\" theory.  See M. de la Puente y Lavalle, El Contrato en General, Pt. 1, Tome 1, at 149-51 (describing the \"teora de la confianza\");  see also Vidal-Ramrez, Tratado de Derecho Civil, at 374-78.  In particular, Article 1361 establishes only a rebuttable presumption that the declaration expressed in the contract reflects the common will of the parties.  \"This approach conserves the benefits of the [objectivist] system, and, in particular, its security, but it also leaves the way open for the interpreter to determine the subjective intent of the declarant,\" which furnishes evidence of the common will of the parties.  Id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, notwithstanding GE del Caribe's arguments to the contrary, it is simply not true that Peruvian law bars courts from considering evidence extrinsic to the text of an ambiguous or unclear contract.  A contract is interpreted as a whole (not as a series of disjointed, independent clauses), and in light of its nature and purpose.  See C. Civ. arts. 169, 170.  Consequently, when an individual clause appears to be inconsistent with the others and with the purpose of the contract, a court is empowered to inquire further into the common will of the parties.  In doing so, the court operates under a presumption that the text of the clause in question reflects the common will of the parties, but the presumption may be rebutted by evidence to the contrary as to the common will of the parties.  See C. Civ. art. 1361.  A fortiori, that evidence can only be evidence that is extrinsic to the contract.  If the evidence is sufficient to rebut the Article 1361 presumption, the court may enforce the terms of the contract as it finds that they were agreed to, rather than as they were written.  See Lavalle-Zago, Contratos at 197-98.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With regard to the case at hand, we agree with the district court's conclusion that the \"facilitation\" clause was not consistent with the rest of the contract.  The contract was entitled \"Agreement to Purchase,\" and labeled the parties as \"BUYERS\" and \"SELLERS.\"   Most of the other clauses in the contract were consistent with the interpretation that the Agreement was, in fact, a contract for the sale of cotton.  The first sentence in the facilitation clause, however, indicates that SECOMAN is to use GE del Caribe as a facilitator and sales consultant, which, as both parties agree, is difficult to reconcile with the view that the Agreement is a sales contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are at least two alternative interpretations of this discrepancy, the one advocated by SECOMAN and adopted by the district court, and the one espoused by GE del Caribe.  As one commentator has noted with regard to Article 168, courts are not required to interpret words literally, \"when such an interpretation would lead to [an] absurd [result] or to contradiction.\"   LavalleZago, Contratos at 194.  In this case, both parties' interpretations may lead to internal contradictions:  SECOMAN's interpretation appears to be contradicted by the first sentence of the facilitation clause, while GE del Caribe's interpretation appears to be contradicted by the title of the Agreement and the nomenclature of the parties used therein.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regardless of which interpretation is correct, we find that the meaning of the facilitation clause was sufficiently contentious to make it necessary for the district court to receive any evidence that was probative of the common will of the parties.  In this regard, we find no merit in GE del Caribe's claim that the subsequent conduct of the parties may not be used by a court in interpreting a contract.  To the contrary, when the meaning of a contract is unclear, \"the entire behavior of the parties must be observed, before, during, and even after the conclusion of the contract.\"   Max Arias-Schreiber, Cdigo Civil Peruano de 1984 [Peruvian Civil Code of 1984 ], Tome I, at 89-90 (Lima, Peru 1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Findings of Fact</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A single reading of the Agreement suggests that the parties intended to enter into some sort of binding contract.  As noted before, the Agreement was entitled \"Agreement to Purchase,\" labeled the parties \"BUYERS\" and \"SELLERS,\" indicated the price and quantity of the cotton being offered, expressed the parties' various guarantees and obligations in imperative language, and was signed by the President and Managing Director of GE del Caribe and SECOMAN, respectively.  At first blush, the Agreement appears to be a contract for the sale of cotton.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon examining the Agreement more closely, however, that initial impression is placed in doubt.  For example, the first sentence of the Agreement states that the parties are agreeing to \"initiate this agreement to purchase,\" which could lead one to question whether the Agreement was merely designed to pave the way to further negotiations.  Similarly, the Agreement does not literally state that the sellers will sell the cotton, or that the buyers will buy it.  Instead, the Agreement indicates that \"[t]he SELLERS guarantee ... [t]hat they have available to sell a total of 1000 metric tons of PIMA cotton,\" and that \"[t]he BUYERS agree ... that they will produce a letter of credit (negotiable) with due diligence.\"   On the basis of the text alone, it is not possible to establish with certainty that the Agreement contemplates the immediate sale of cotton to GE del Caribe.  Moreover, as we have discussed above, it is very difficult to reconcile the text of the facilitation clause with the view that the Agreement is a contract for the sale of cotton.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was faced with the task of making sense of this unclear text.  GE del Caribe contends that, upon determining that the text alone was insufficient to establish the existence of a contract of sale, the court should have ruled that there was no contract.  As we have explained, however, when a court is faced with a text such as this, the principle of conservation of contracts directs the court to look beyond the four corners of the contract for evidence of the common will of the parties.  After all, one conclusion that can be drawn with confidence from the text itself is that the parties intended the Agreement to be binding.  As GE del Caribe correctly points out, that does not necessarily mean that the Agreement is a binding contract, because the terms of the Agreement must comply with the requirements established by Peruvian contract law.  It does, however, mean that the court may presume that the Agreement is a contract, and therefore investigate further to determine what the specific terms of the contract might be.  During such an inquiry, moreover, the party claiming that the Agreement is not a contract bears the burden of proof.  See C. Civ. art. 1361.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing the evidence that the district court had before it, we conclude that its finding that the Agreement to Purchase was a binding contract for the sale of cotton was not clearly erroneous.  First, there is substantial evidence indicating that both SECOMAN and GE del Caribe perceived themselves to be bound by the Agreement and acted accordingly.  Indeed, it would be difficult to characterize the evidence that GE del Caribe deposited $100,000 in Mr. Gordillo's bank account, or that Mr. Aranda made a substantial effort to obtain a confirmed letter of credit, as indicating anything but that the parties perceived the Agreement to be binding.  In addition, GE del Caribe sent SECOMAN a fax ratifying the Agreement, stating that Mr. Aranda \"is authorized by GE del Caribe to negotiate and conclude business deals such as the one we have concluded on March 24 with your company.\"  (Emphasis supplied).  GE del Caribe's decision to send SECOMAN a letter of credit, albeit one that did not comply with the Agreement, also tends to undermine the claim that it did not consider the Agreement to have any binding force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the conclusion that the contract was specifically one for the sale of cotton is supported by the text of the Agreement and by the testimony of the plaintiffs and their legal experts, which the district court found credible.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  For example, we perceive no error in the district court's determination that the clause stating that the \"[c]ost offered per pound:  $1.58 USD\" provided the sale price, or in the finding that the reference to 1000 tons of cotton being available indicated that the quantity of cotton sold was 1000 tons.  The court heard testimony indicating that these price and quantity terms were the terms of SECOMAN's offer, and that GE del Caribe accepted the offer by signing the Agreement.  The fact that the Agreement uses the terms \"cost offered\" and \"availability\" rather than \"price for sale\" and \"quantity sold\" does not necessarily imply that the Agreement was not a contract of sale.  Moreover, the Agreement was typewritten by a non-lawyer who, to judge from the fact that he could not wait until the following working day, was apparently in a hurry to close the deal.  We thus find that there was sufficient evidence before the court to allow it to conclude that the Agreement contained price and quantity terms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the findings as to the delivery term are perfectly consistent with the Civil Code's default provisions.  See C. Civ. arts. 1552, 1553.  In particular, the Code provides that, absent a stipulation to the contrary, a good is delivered by making available to the buyer at the place where it is located.  See C. Civ. art. 1553.  Accordingly, SECOMAN's agreement to make the cotton available and ready to ship was sufficient to comply with its contractual obligation to deliver the cotton.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also heard testimony indicating that Mr. Aranda had mis-drafted the facilitation clause, erroneously transposing the names of GE del Caribe and SECOMAN.  GE del Caribe argues that such testimony was inherently unreliable, since the resulting clause would be internally inconsistent.  We disagree.  The resulting clause would read as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p>That GE del Caribe will use SELLERS as facilitators and sales consultants during this transaction.  SELLERS will not negotiate sale of the lot aforementioned without the written agreement of GE del Caribe.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's reading is not implausible.  Indeed, far from being internally incoherent, the resulting clause is consistent with a contract whereby SECOMAN sells cotton to GE del Caribe, which then resells the cotton.  According to the district court's understanding of this aspect of the Agreement, although Mr. Aranda had some potential buyers in mind, SECOMAN agreed to assist GE del Caribe in its efforts to resell the cotton because of its greater expertise in the cotton market.  GE del Caribe, however, retained final authority to approve or reject any offer from a potential buyer.  Given the evidence heard at trial, we cannot say that it was clear error for the district court to find that this was the deal agreed to by Mr. Aranda and Mr. Gordillo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, it was not clear error for the district court to find that the Agreement required GE del Caribe to submit a confirmed letter of credit, based on evidence that, as a matter of customary practice in international trade and finance, a letter of credit will not be treated as negotiable unless it is confirmed by a bank.  Based on this evidence, as well as on evidence that GE's policy is never to accept an unconfirmed letter of credit because it is not negotiable, the court also found that GE del Caribe knew of this customary practice and thus knew that the Agreement required the letter of credit to be confirmed.  We find the evidence sufficient to support the court's conclusions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, GE del Caribe failed to show that the Agreement was not a sales contract.  Although GE del Caribe presented some evidence to the contrary, the evidence on SECOMAN's side was not so unreliable as to make it unreasonable for the district court to give it credit.  Moreover, although GE del Caribe has focused on arguing that the Agreement was not a binding contract, it has also hinted that the Agreement might have been binding after all, but only as part of a multilateral barter trade agreement, rather than as a simple contract of sale.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Admittedly, GE del Caribe's proposed interpretation of the Agreement is plausible, but it is not our province to make findings of fact.  More importantly, even if the Agreement had been a barter trade contract, GE del Caribe failed to show that it would not have required GE del Caribe to produce the letter of credit.  Given that SECOMAN's cause of action arises out of GE's willful failure to produce a negotiable letter of credit, it is unclear whether GE's proposed reading of the Agreement would lead to a different result in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we address GE del Caribe's argument that the Agreement was invalid because its purpose was unlawful.  Article 1403 of the Civil Code provides that the \"obligation that is the object of the contract must be legitimate.\"   We agree that under Peruvian law, a contract for an unlawful purpose is void.  However, as GE del Caribe admits, nothing on the face of the Agreement indicates that the Agreement had an illegal purpose.  Instead, GE del Caribe's argument is based on the plaintiff's testimony indicating that SECOMAN requested payment in the form of a letter of credit so that it could circumvent Peru's foreign exchange and tax laws.  GE del Caribe specifically claims that SECOMAN violated a Peruvian law that requires exporters to deposit any proceeds from their sales abroad in the government-owned Central Bank, which converts the proceeds to Peruvian currency at a rate that is usually less favorable than the market exchange rate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the evidence did show that the purpose of arranging for payment by means of a letter of credit was to permit SECOMAN to choose an advantageous time to convert the letter into currency, GE del Caribe has failed to establish that such a strategy is, in fact, illegal under Peruvian law.  For example, it is not clear that the duty to deposit the proceeds from export transactions extends to forms of payment other than payment in currency, such as payment by letter of credit.  Moreover, SECOMAN presented evidence that even when payment is made in currency, the duty to deposit the proceeds does not arise until the transaction is consummated.  Because SECOMAN had not shipped any cotton when GE del Caribe breached the Agreement, it does not appear that SECOMAN was yet under a duty to deposit the $100,000 in the Central Bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Damages</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reviewing the district court's findings as to damages for clear error, we find only one.  The district court's award of damages to SECOMAN apparently failed to take into account the $100,000 that was paid up front to Mr. Gordillo as a deposit on the Agreement.  The district court did not make an explicit finding that the deposit was not to be considered an advance on the payment due under the Agreement, and we would consider any such finding to be clearly erroneous.  We will therefore reduce the award of damages contained in the district court's judgment by $100,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject, however, GE's contention that the award of damages should be reduced by the amount of taxes that SECOMAN would have had to pay on the proceeds from this sale.  Such a reduction might have been in order only upon proof that SECOMAN would not be liable for payment of taxes on its award, see Atlas Truck Leasing, Inc. v. First N.H. Banks, Inc., 808 F.2d 902, 905 (1st Cir.1987), and no such proof was provided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also do not agree with GE del Caribe's argument that the district court erred both in determining that GE del Caribe acted with dolus and in its calculation of damages.  A party acts with dolus when that party willfully fails to perform an obligation.  See C. Civ. art. 1318.  A determination that a breaching party acted with dolus has a substantial effect upon the damages available to the injured party.  Any person breaching a contract is \"responsible for compensating the losses and damages [proximately] caused by its failure to perform.\"   See C. Civ. art. 1321.  However, a person who breaches a contract with dolus is also liable for any unforeseeable damages caused by the breach.  See id.   GE del Caribe correctly states that a finding of dolus requires a finding that the breaching party intentionally breached an obligation that it knew was binding, and that a court must analyze the subjective intent of the breaching party in order to make a finding of dolus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its opinion, however, the district court found that GE del Caribe \"knew that by failing to tender a negotiable letter of credit, it was performing an act contrary to the contractual obligations it had assumed\" under the Agreement.  The court's conclusion was based on evidence indicating that SECOMAN had informed GE del Caribe of its pressing need for the negotiable letter of credit, that at least some GE del Caribe employees were aware that the Agreement required payment to be made by means of an irrevocable letter of credit, and that GE del Caribe was concerned about the significant decline in the price of cotton.  The court also found the letter sent by GE del Caribe on June 11, 1990, in which GE del Caribe claimed that SECOMAN's rejection of the terms of the letter of credit \"release[d] and excuse[d][it] from any and all performance [under the Agreement],\" to be evidence probative of bad faith.  In particular, the letter indicates that GE del Caribe felt the need to find a way to be released from the Agreement, which in turn supports the implication that it knew itself to be bound by the Agreement.  Reviewing these findings only for clear error, with due deference to the trier of fact's greater ability to gauge the demeanor and credibility of the witnesses, we cannot say that the district court's findings were clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GE del Caribe also raised several other challenges to the district court's calculation of damages, including claims that the court should have reduced the award of damages by the amount by which the Peruvian foreign exchange restrictions would have reduced SECOMAN's profits, that the court should not have based its award of damages on the assumption that SECOMAN had actually purchased 1000 tons of cotton, that there was no evidence from which the court could conclude that SECOMAN suffered losses on \"cover sales,\" that the court failed to deduct $200,000 attributable to Mr. Manuel Bentin's partial ownership of the cotton, and that the court should not have compensated SECOMAN for the liability it incurred when it breached two subsequent contracts for the sale of cotton.  We affirm the district court on these points, substantially for the reasons expressed in its opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Attorney's Fees</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GE del Caribe contends that the district court's award under P.R. R. Civ. P. 44.1(d) was erroneous because Puerto Rico law was inapplicable to this case.  In the alternative, GE del Caribe claims that, even if Rule 44 were applicable to this case, the district court abused its discretion in finding that GE del Caribe had litigated in an obstinate manner.  We disagree with both claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In general terms, a federal court sitting in diversity applies the substantive law of the forum state and federal procedural rules.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2072 (the \"Rules Enabling Act\");  Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 78, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938);  Woods-Leber v. Hyatt Hotels of P.R., Inc., 124 F.3d 47, 50 (1st Cir.1997).  A state law \"that would be controlling in an action upon the same claim by the same parties in a State court\" is substantive for Erie purposes if it would \"significantly affect the result of a litigation for a federal court to disregard it.\"  Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U.S. 99, 109, 65 S.Ct. 1464, 89 L.Ed. 2079 (1945).  It has long been the law in this circuit that P.R. R. Civ. P. 44.1 is substantive for Erie purposes.  See Dopp v. Pritzker, 38 F.3d 1239, 1252 (1st Cir.1994);  Pan Am.  World Airways, Inc. v. Ramos, 357 F.2d 341, 342 (1st Cir.1966).  State conflict of laws rules are also considered substantive for purposes of the Erie doctrine.  See Day &amp; Zimmermann, Inc. v. Challoner, 423 U.S. 3, 4, 96 S.Ct. 167, 46 L.Ed.2d 3 (1975);  Klaxon v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487, 496, 61 S.Ct. 1020, 85 L.Ed. 1477 (1941);  New Ponce Shopping Ctr. v. Integrand Assurance Co., 86 F.3d 265, 267 (1st Cir.1996).  The courts of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico have consistently followed the choice of law rules laid out in the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws.  See, e.g., Efectos Litograficos, C.A. v. National Paper &amp; Type Co. of Puerto Rico, 112 P.R. Dec. 389, 396-97 (1982);  Partido Popular Democratico v. Barreto Perez, 111 P.R. Dec. 199, 256 (1981);  Archilla Y Mauricio Cucalon v. Smyth Worldwide Movers, Inc., 106 P.R. Dec. 538, 550 (1977);  Green Giant Co. v. Tribunal Superior, 104 P.R. Dec. 489, 499 (1975);  Fernandez Vda.  De Fornaris v. American Surety Co. of New York, 93 P.R. Dec. 29, 48 (1966).  Pursuant to section 122 of the Restatement, \"[a] court usually applies its own local law rules prescribing how litigation shall be conducted even when it applies the local law rules of another state to resolve other issues in the case.\"   Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws &#167; 122 (1969).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GE's contention is that Rule 44.1 is applicable only in those diversity cases in which the merits of the controversy are determined on the basis of the substantive law of Puerto Rico.  GE del Caribe concludes that, since Puerto Rico's conflict of laws rules establish that Peruvian law governs the underlying dispute, Rule 44.1 is inapplicable to this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GE's argument is based upon the erroneous premise that if a particular state law is \"substantive\" for purposes of Erie analysis, it must also be substantive for purposes of conflict of laws analysis.  To the contrary, the U.S. Supreme Court has \"reject[ed] the notion that there is an equivalence between what is substantive under Erie doctrine and what is substantive for purposes of conflict of laws.\"  Sun Oil Co. v. Wortman, 486 U.S. 717, 722, 108 S.Ct. 2117, 100 L.Ed.2d 743 (1988) (citing Guaranty Trust Co., 326 U.S. at 108, 65 S.Ct. 1464).   As the Court explained in Sun Oil,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p>Except at the extremes, the terms \"substance\" and \"procedure\" describe very little except a dichotomy, and what they mean in a particular context is largely determined by the purposes for which the dichotomy is drawn.  In the context of our Erie jurisprudence, ... that purpose is to establish (within the limits of applicable federal law, including the prescribed Rules of Federal Procedure) substantial uniformity of predictable outcomes between cases tried in a federal court and cases tried in the courts of the State in which the federal court sits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">486 U.S. at 726-27, 108 S.Ct. 2117.   In the conflict of laws context, in contrast, the traditional substance-procedure dichotomy sought to reflect the relative interests of both the forum and of the foreign jurisdiction in having their law be applied to a case involving both forum and foreign law.  See Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws &#167; 122 cmts. a, b (1969);  see generally James W. Moore, Moore's Federal Practice p 0.310 at 3129-30 (1996).  In fact, the Restatement notes that characterizations of laws as \"substantive\" or \"procedural,\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p>[W]hile harmless in themselves, have led some courts into unthinking adherence to precedents that have classified a given issue as 'procedural' or 'substantive,' regardless of what purposes were involved in the earlier classifications....  To avoid encouraging errors of that sort, the rules stated in [the Restatement] do not attempt to classify issues as 'procedural' or 'substantive.'   Instead they face directly the question whether the forum's rule should be applied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws &#167; 122 cmt. b (1969).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In cases involving the law of a state or country other than the forum state, therefore, a district court sitting in diversity must engage in a two-step inquiry.  First, the district court determines whether a particular matter is procedural or substantive for Erie purposes.  If the matter is procedural, federal law is applied, and if substantive, the court follows the law of the forum state.  Second, if a choice of law must be made, for example, because a contractual choice-of-law clause is at issue or because a tort was committed in another jurisdiction, the district court applies the law that would be applied under the conflict of laws rules of the forum state.  However, \"[i]n determining whether any state law will be adopted, the fact that a matter is characterized as substantive by the state courts for choice of law purposes does not connote that it will also be substantive for purposes of Erie, and the converse should be true.\"  Maryland Cas. Co. v. Williams, 377 F.2d 389, 393 n. 1 (5th Cir.1967).  Contrary to GE's contention, therefore, the fact that Rule 44.1 is considered \"substantive\" for Erie purposes does not bar a finding that it is \"procedural\" for conflict of laws purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the case at hand, we are faced with the question whether, pursuant to section 122 of the Restatement, the courts of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico would apply Rule 44.1 in a suit otherwise subject to the laws of another state or country.  Although we have found no Puerto Rico decision directly on point, we are confident that the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico would conclude that Rule 44.1 is a \"local law rule[ ] prescribing how litigation shall be conducted.\"   Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws &#167; 122.  Rule 44.1 does not modify the parties' substantive rights under the law.  Instead, it serves the institutional concerns of the courts by allowing the imposition of sanctions upon parties who abuse the judicial process.  After all, \"[t]he purpose behind [Rules 44.1 and 44.3] is to penalize 'a losing party that because of his stubbornness, obstinacy, rashness, and insistent frivolous attitude has forced the other party to needlessly assume the pains, costs, efforts, and inconveniences of a litigation.' \"  Dopp, 38 F.3d at 1253 (quoting Fernandez Marino Y Otros v. San Juan Cement Co., 118 P.R.

Second, we do not agree that \"the issue is one whose resolution is likely to affect the ultimate result of the case,\" Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws &#167; 122 cmt. a, because, although the imposition of sanctions under Rule 44.1 does entail the payment of a monetary penalty, the penalty is not a remedy arising out of the cause of action.  Third, laws providing for awards of attorneys' fees have not been consistently classified as either \"procedural\" or \"substantive\" for choice-of-law purposes, either in Puerto Rico or elsewhere.  Compare Du-Wel Products v. United States Fire Ins., 236 N.J.Super. 349, 565 A.2d 1113, 1120 (1990) (Michigan counsel fee law held procedural and therefore inapplicable to suit brought in New Jersey state court), with Aries v. Palmer Johnson, Inc., 153 Ariz. 250, 735 P.2d 1373, 1380 (App.1987) (Arizona law providing for award of attorney's fees was substantive);  cf. Arno v.

For example, this court has not been able to determine what the Peruvian law of civil procedure would provide in a situation such as the one at hand.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  In any case, Peruvian civil procedure is not as easily transplanted as its substantive law of obligations and contracts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finding that the district court did not err as a matter of law in determining that GE del Caribe's conduct in this case should evaluated under Rule 44.1, we turn next to the question whether the district court abused its discretion in determining that GE del Caribe behaved in a manner deserving of sanctions under that rule.  See Dopp, 38 F.3d at 1253 (explaining that appellate review of orders imposing sanctions under Rule 44.1 is for abuse of discretion).  Rule 44.1(d) provides, in pertinent part:  \"In the event any party or its lawyer has acted obstinately or frivolously, the court shall, in its judgment, impose on such person the payment of a sum for attorney's fees which the court decides corresponds to such conduct.\"  \"The purpose behind [Rule 44.1] is to penalize 'a losing party that because of his stubbornness, obstinacy, rashness, and insistent frivolous attitude has forced the other party to needlessly assume the pains, costs, efforts, and inconveniences of a litigation.' \"  Dopp, 38 F.3d at 1253 (quoting Fernandez Marino Y Otros v. San Juan Cement Co., 118 P.R. Dec. 713, 718 (1987)).  For the reasons already discussed above, we have affirmed the district court's determination that GE del Caribe breached its obligations under the Agreement in bad faith.  A finding of bad faith implies that GE del Caribe was aware that it was breaching its obligations under the Agreement when, in June 1990, it attempted unilaterally to terminate the Agreement.  We thus find no abuse of discretion in the district court's further conclusion that GE del Caribe's complete denial of liability, by forcing the plaintiffs and the court to undergo the expense of litigating a full trial, was an obstinate posture deserving of sanctions under Rule 44.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's judgment on the issue of liability, but reduce the award of damages by $100,000.

The principle of good faith thus legitimizes the interpreter's reasonable reliance on the declaration of will as a guide to the parties' common will.  Another important difference is that the evidence that may be used to rebut the presumption established by Article 1362 is evidence of the common will of the parties, as opposed to each side's own subjective intent</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> During trial, therefore, GE del Caribe bore the burden of proving that the Agreement was an incomplete, and consequently non-binding, contract.

(GE del Caribe's sister company), to support their overseas sales, particularly to countries with high rates of inflation or with unfavorable currency conversion rates, by guaranteeing payment in dollars rather than in local currency.  The structure of these transactions is fairly uniform.  A multi-national company (A) sells certain products to an overseas customer (B), but, instead of receiving payment in the customer's national currency, the customer turns the payment over to a third company (C), which is located in the same country but is engaged in the export business.  In exchange for the transfer of funds in national currency from B, C assigns to A the proceeds of its international sales, denominated in dollars</p>\n        <p>GE del Caribe's suggestion is that the Agreement in this case specified the relationship between A and C, where A is GE del Caribe, and C is SECOMAN.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> In its brief, GE del Caribe states that \"Peru does have a procedural 'loser pay[s]' rule which has no applicability to a trial in Puerto Rico.\"  We note that, aside from the fact that GE del Caribe fails to provide a citation to that rule, GE's view of its applicability is not entirely consistent with its claim that Rule 44.1 is \"substantive.\"   Peru's \"loser pays\" rule, which presumably always provides an award of attorney's fees to the prevailing party in a suit, has a much better claim to being \"substantive\" than a rule awarding attorney's fees only as a sanction for frivolous litigation.  After all, a \"loser pays\" rule could be conceived of as adding an award of attorney's fees to the recovery provided by the underlying cause of action.  If both Rule 44.1 and the unnamed Peruvian rule were \"substantive\" for conflict of laws purposes, we would be forced to choose between them, and it is not obvious that we would choose Rule 44.1 over the Peruvian rule</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Defendant General Electric del Caribe, Inc.

(\"SECOMAN\"), a Peruvian partnership.  Following a bench trial, the district court found for SECOMAN, awarded damages for loss of profits caused by the breach, and ordered GE del Caribe to pay a portion of SECOMAN's attorneys' fees as a sanction under P.R.

Until 1989, SECOMAN was licensed to sell cotton only inside Peru.  At that time, SECOMAN attempted to enter the international cotton market, first by obtaining a license to export cotton from Peru, and then by entering into a joint venture with another Peruvian business to buy cotton and resell it on the international market.  The joint venture focused on Pima rather than Tanguis cotton because Pima cotton is of higher quality and is generally in greater demand.  Moreover, at the time there was a substantial differential between the price at which Pima cotton could be purchased from cotton producers in Peru and the international market price.  In order to build a stock of cotton for export, SECOMAN obtained lines of credit, totaling $2,000,000, from various Peruvian banks.  In the fall of 1989, SECOMAN began to purchase Pima cotton.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GE del Caribe, a corporation organized under the laws of Puerto Rico, is a subsidiary of the GE Supply Company, based in Connecticut, which is in turn a division of the General Electric Company.  As its name suggests, GE del Caribe is engaged in the sale of General Electric products in the Caribbean, Central America, and South America.  Mr. Enrique Aranda, a Peruvian national, was the president of GE del Caribe from 1986 to 1993.  In 1990, he was trying to increase his company's sales by penetrating different Latin American markets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1990, Mr. Aranda spoke with a friend in Peru, Mr. Huertas del Pino, who was the president of Carmel Export Agency, Inc.  (\"Carmel\"), and who informed him that through his contacts there, he could facilitate GE del Caribe's expansion into that market.  In particular, Mr. Huertas had a business relationship with Horizon Trading, Inc.  (\"Horizon\"), a Peruvian entity established in the Cayman Islands and engaged in the export of Peruvian products.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Around the same time, Horizon was informed that there was a seller on the market ready to provide 1,000 tons of Pima cotton for sale at $1.70 per pound, and that the seller was willing to pay a commission on the sale.  Horizon communicated this information, as well as the fact that the international price for Pima cotton was $2.40 per pound, to Mr. Huertas, who replied that he believed that he could find a buyer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That person was Mr. Aranda.  Mr. Huertas arranged for a meeting to take place in Peru between Mr. Aranda and several Peruvian businessmen who were interested in exporting cotton and other Peruvian products.  In preparation for the meeting, Mr. Aranda requested that both Mr. Huertas and a GE del Caribe employee provide him with information regarding the cotton market.  He received samples of SECOMAN's Pima cotton, and began to research the possibility of reselling the cotton abroad.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The meeting was held on Friday, March 23, 1990, at the Caesar's Palace Hotel in Lima, Peru.  Among those present was Mr. Alfredo Gordillo, general manager and 90% owner of SECOMAN.  At the meeting, Mr. Aranda told Mr. Gordillo that he was interested in purchasing the cotton that SECOMAN had in stock.  Although Mr. Gordillo was offering only 600 tons, when asked whether he could supply more he stated that he could export up to a total of 1,000 tons, at $1.72 per pound.  After the meeting, Mr. Aranda called Mr. Gordillo and insisted that the two of them meet again the following day to discuss the transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the second meeting, held in Mr. Gordillo's office, Mr. Aranda and Mr. Gordillo negotiated the details of an agreement pursuant to which GE del Caribe would purchase 1,000 tons of Pima cotton from SECOMAN.  Among other things, Mr. Gordillo agreed to Mr. Aranda's request that the asking price be reduced to $1.58 per pound.  Payment was to be made by a negotiable letter of credit, with a face value of $2,800,000, which would be submitted to SECOMAN for its approval.  GE del Caribe was also to make an initial deposit of $100,000 in Mr. Gordillo's account in a Miami, Florida bank.  As they had discussed the day before, SECOMAN had 600 tons of Pima cotton in stock and ready to ship immediately.  Mr. Aranda agreed to allow SECOMAN an additional two weeks to purchase and ship the extra 400 tons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Gordillo also asked Mr. Aranda whether he had pre-sold the cotton.  Mr. Aranda replied that he had not, but that he had some prospects.  Mr. Aranda asked Mr. Gordillo for the names of some of SECOMAN's clients, which Mr. Gordillo agreed to do if Mr. Aranda's prospective buyers did not purchase the cotton.  Mr. Gordillo also offered SECOMAN's services as a sales agent for GE del Caribe, given SECOMAN's greater expertise in the cotton market.  Mr. Aranda agreed, but only on condition that SECOMAN not offer the same cotton for sale without GE's prior written authorization.  Finally, Mr. Gordillo asked Mr. Aranda to have GE del Caribe confirm his authority to enter into the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because it was a Saturday, Mr. Gordillo did not have secretarial assistance in the office, and he therefore suggested that the agreement be drafted at a later date.  Mr. Aranda stated, however, that he would rather have a document drafted immediately, and then proceeded to type up the substance of their agreements in English in a document entitled \"Agreement to Purchase\" (\"Agreement\").  Both of them then signed the Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Initially, the parties began to perform their respective duties under the Agreement.  Thus, on March 29, 1990, GE's Vice President of Finance sent a letter by facsimile to SECOMAN ratifying the Agreement, indicating that Mr. Aranda was \"authorized by GE del Caribe to negotiate and conclude business deals such as the one we have concluded on March 24 with [SECOMAN].\"  On April 20, 1990, GE del Caribe deposited the agreed-upon $100,000 in Mr. Gordillo's bank account.  SECOMAN, in the meantime, began purchasing additional Pima cotton to comply with its duty to provide a total of 1,000 tons of cotton.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Aranda had also immediately begun to seek buyers for the cotton at $1.90 per pound.  However, by April 5, 1990, he had not yet found any buyers, so on that day he wrote to SECOMAN indicating that the sale of the cotton was taking longer than foreseen and requesting an additional eight working days to conclude the sale.  At the same time, Mr. Huertas was also negotiating the sale of 1,000 tons of Pima cotton at $1.90 per pound.  Mr. Huertas also required the prospective buyer to make a $100,000 deposit.  Although Mr. Huertas claimed that it was merely a coincidence that he was offering Pima cotton for sale on the same terms as GE del Caribe, the district court found that Mr. Huertas had no cotton of his own, but was instead helping Mr. Aranda to find a buyer for the cotton that GE del Caribe had purchased from SECOMAN.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Throughout the late spring and early summer of 1990, the international market price for Pima cotton was steadily dropping, dooming Mr. Aranda's efforts to sell the cotton that GE del Caribe had purchased from SECOMAN.  For example, on May 14, 1990, Mr. Aranda contacted again a potential purchaser who had offered to buy the cotton at $1.70 per pound, but had originally been turned down because GE del Caribe was asking for $1.90 per pound.  Even though Mr. Aranda lowered the sale price to $1.73 per pound, the offeree rejected the offer noting that the world price had dropped even further.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In mid-April, Mr. Aranda began to visit banks in Puerto Rico to obtain the letter of credit that was due under the Agreement. At that time, he had not yet informed his superiors of his trip to Peru, of the existence of the Agreement, or of his efforts to sell the cotton.  The banks, however, would not issue a letter of credit without a guarantee, or \"letter of comfort,\" from GE's parent company.  Therefore, in early May, Mr. Aranda sought the assistance of his superiors in GE Supply Co., explaining that GE del Caribe needed the letter of comfort in order to obtain the letter of credit that SECOMAN was to receive pursuant to the Agreement.  He also explained that GE del Caribe stood to gain $300,000 on the sale of the cotton.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Aranda's superiors, however, refused to issue the letter of comfort, instructed him not to comply further with the Agreement, and began to investigate the matter.  On May 23, 1990, Mr. James Ambrose, who was the Chairman of the Board of Directors of GE del Caribe as well as an officer in GE Supply, flew to Puerto Rico to discuss the Agreement with Mr. Aranda.  Mr. Ambrose expressed his displeasure over the fact that Mr. Aranda had committed GE del Caribe to this transaction without the approval of the Board of Directors.  At its next meeting, the Board reprimanded Mr. Aranda for his actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that from that point on, GE del Caribe sought ways to shirk its duties under the contract.  In particular, after much delay, GE del Caribe sent SECOMAN a revocable letter of credit.  SECOMAN rejected the proffered letter and requested, instead, a confirmed, irrevocable letter of credit.  On June 11, 1990, GE del Caribe wrote to SECOMAN claiming that SECOMAN's rejection of the proffered letters was an essential breach of the contract that entitled GE del Caribe to resolve the Agreement.  However, the district court determined that SECOMAN had not breached any obligation in rejecting the revocable letter of credit, since such a letter did not satisfy the requirement, imposed by the Agreement, that GE del Caribe produce a negotiable letter of credit because only irrevocable letters of credit can be negotiable.  The district court further determined that GE del Caribe's violation of this aspect of the contract was willful and in bad faith, since it knew that the Agreement required that the letter of credit be irrevocable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GE del Caribe's initial delay and eventual failure to procure an irrevocable letter of credit not only deprived SECOMAN of its expected profit on the Pima cotton transaction, but also started a chain reaction that devastated SECOMAN's finances.  GE del Caribe's failure to tender a negotiable letter of credit rendered SECOMAN unable to meet its obligations under the lines of credit it had opened the year before.  SECOMAN was then reported to the Superintendent of Banks and Insurance of Peru for its failure to meet these obligations and placed on a list of defaulting entities.  The listing prevented SECOMAN from obtaining any further financing, which in turn prevented SECOMAN from purchasing the additional cotton that it was required to deliver under two different contracts with other parties.  Because of its breach of its obligations under these contracts, the buyers filed demands for arbitration against SECOMAN.  Awards were entered against SECOMAN in both arbitrations.  Thus, in addition to losing its expected profits on those contracts, SECOMAN was ordered to pay damages to the buyers.  Finally, the cumulative effect of these losses was to reduce SECOMAN's value as a going concern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SECOMAN subsequently filed suit against GE del Caribe for breach of contract in the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, alleging alienage jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a)(2).  Before trial, the parties stipulated that their dispute was governed by Peruvian law.  After an extensive bench trial, the district court determined that GE del Caribe had not only breached the Agreement, but also that it had done so with \"dolo\" or dolus--that is, in bad faith.  Under Peruvian contract law, a defendant who breaches a contract in bad faith is liable for all damages proximately caused by the breach, including unforeseeable damages.  See Cdigo Civil (C. Civ.) art.  1321 (Peru).  Accordingly, the district court's award of damages to SECOMAN included its loss of profits on the sale of cotton to GE del Caribe, as well as all other losses it suffered as a consequence of the breach.  Finally, the district court required GE del Caribe to pay a certain portion of SECOMAN's attorney's fees, as a sanction for GE's obstinate conduct.  GE del Caribe then filed the appeal that is now before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

Analysis</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Breach of Contract</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GE del Caribe contends that the district court erred in determining that it breached its obligations under the \"Agreement to Purchase,\" for the simple reason that the Agreement was not a final and binding contract under the law of Peru.  In support of its claim, GE del Caribe points out three different flaws in the Agreement that arguably prevent it from being a binding contract.  First, GE del Caribe claims that the Agreement fails to comply with C. Civ. art. 1359, which provides that \"[n]o contract exists as long as the parties do not agree with all of its stipulations, even if the discrepancy is secondary,\" because the Agreement lacks an undertaking to purchase, a price term, a delivery term, and an agreement on the terms for the letter of credit.  Second, GE del Caribe contends that the district court's reliance on evidence extrinsic to the Agreement, particularly in determining that the Agreement's \"facilitation\" clause contained a drafting error, was ultra vires because, under Peruvian law, a court may not use extrinsic evidence to interpret a contract, let alone to rewrite its clear and unambiguous terms.  Third, and finally, GE del Caribe asserts that the district court erred in rejecting GE del Caribe's argument that the Agreement was invalid because its purpose was unlawful.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1. Conclusions of Law</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its first two arguments, GE del Caribe implicitly contends that the district court erred both by failing to apply correctly the rules of contractual hermeneutics required by the Peruvian Civil Code, and by finding ambiguity in the terms of the contract when there was none.  However, GE del Caribe's arguments are also based in part on claims that the district court misapprehended the evidence.  As we discussed above, we review de novo the district court's determinations of Peruvian law and of the ambiguousness of the terms of the Agreement, but we review the court's findings of fact only for clear error.  For the sake of clarity and convenience, we first address the questions of law and of contractual hermeneutics, and only then pass on to evaluate the district court's findings of fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>a. Terms of the Agreement</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GE del Caribe's first argument begins with the claim that C. Civ. art. 1359 establishes that there can be no contract if the parties have not reached an agreement as to every element of the contract, whether primary or secondary.  This assumes that a lack of agreement as to any contractual terms, as opposed to a disagreement, is enough to prevent a contract from arising.  Contending that the Agreement lacked an undertaking to purchase and reflected no agreement on price, date of delivery, or the essential terms of the letter of credit, GE del Caribe concludes that there was no contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GE del Caribe's argument is subtly but seriously flawed.  The fundamental problem is that, contrary to GE's assertions, Article 1359 does not require the affirmative agreement of the parties as to each and every term of a contract.  Instead, Article 1359 distinguishes between essential and non-essential terms, requiring affirmative agreement as to essential terms, but merely requiring that there be no disagreement as to non-essential terms.  See Manuel de la Puente y Lavalle, El Contrato en General [Contracts in General ], Pt. 1, Tome 1, at 397-98 (Lima, Peru 1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Silence as to an essential term is fatal;  that is to say, there can be no contract unless the parties have affirmatively agreed to the essential terms of the contract.  The crucial problem is determining which terms are essential and which are not.  As one commentator has noted, some terms are objectively essential, while others are only subjectively essential.  See id. at 392.   Objectively essential terms are those elements of a contract that are made necessary by the very nature of the contract, without regard to the parties' subjective intent.  See id.   Of course, the difficulty of the task of determining which elements are objectively essential depends on the type of contract involved:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>Notwithstanding that it is relatively difficult to establish, as a general rule, just which are the essential terms of each [type of] contract, the task is easier when it involves those types of contracts that are defined by law, such as the contracts [ ] defined in the Peruvian Civil Code....  Thus, for example, insofar as Article 1529 of the Code defines the contract of sale as the contract whereby a seller binds himself to transfer the ownership of a good to a buyer, and the latter to pay a price in money, the essential terms of that contract are the good and the price.  ...  The problem is more delicate with regard to atypical contracts, in which, because of a lack of [legislative] definition, it is hardly possible to determine which contractual obligations are essential and which are secondary....  [I]t is therefore necessary to analyze, case by case, the business purpose of the contract so as to determine which obligations are indispensable for its success:  such obligations will constitute the essential elements of the contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">M. de la Puente y Lavalle, El Contrato en General [Contracts in General ], Pt. 1, Tome 1, at 392 (emphasis supplied).  Subjectively essential terms, in contrast, are those which, even though they are not objectively essential, are deemed to be essential by the contracting parties.  See id.   For example, although a delivery term is not objectively essential to a contract of sale (for reasons discussed below), the parties to such a contract may very well consider these essential to the negotiations.  The question whether a particular term is subjectively essential presents a issue of fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Silence with regard to non-essential terms, in contrast, is not fatal because the Civil Code's norms regarding contracts \"are suppletory to the will of the parties, save for those that are imperative.\"   C. Civ. art. 1356.  Article 1356 must be read in conjunction with C. Civ. art. 1354, which, in stating that \"[t]he parties may freely determine the content of a contract, so long as it is not contrary to any imperative legal norms,\" establishes a distinction between the imperative and optional provisions of the Civil Code.  Optional norms are presumed to apply to a given contract, but parties may elect otherwise, whereas the parties may not opt out of imperative norms.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Stated differently, a contract is subject to all imperative norms, as well as any optional norms not excluded by the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the parties' silence as to any non-essential term is not fatal under Article 1359 because the Code's optional norms provide the missing terms.  In contrast, if rather than silence we find disagreement as to any such term, then there can be no contract, because the fact that there is a dispute over a given term rebuts the presumption that the parties would consent to the incorporation of the Code's suppletory norms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted before, GE del Caribe claims that the Agreement to purchase was not a contract because it lacked an undertaking to purchase, a price term, a delivery term, and an agreement on the terms for the letter of credit.  The claim fails, for a variety of reasons.  With regard to the two essential terms that GE del Caribe contends were missing, these were found by the district court to be present.  For example, the alleged lack of an explicit undertaking to purchase is irrelevant because the district court found that such an undertaking was implicit in the Agreement.  Similarly, the district court found that the line in the Agreement stating \"Cost offered per pound:  $1.58 USD\" was an explicit price term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lack of an explicit agreement on the time and place of delivery does not prevent a contract from arising in this case.  The delivery term is not objectively essential to a contract of sale because C. Civ. arts. 1552 and 1553 provide default rules governing the time and place of delivery.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Moreover, there is no evidence on the record that the delivery term was subjectively essential, and articles 1552 and 1553 are not excluded either explicitly or implicitly by the terms of the Agreement to Purchase.  Consequently, these provisions are applicable to this contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the argument based on the letter of credit is also unconvincing.  The method of payment is not an objectively essential term of a contract of sale.  Moreover, although the parties to a sales contract could consider the method of payment to be subjectively essential, there is no indication that such was the case here.  In particular, reviewing the text of the Agreement,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> we find no stipulation that the content of the letter was to be the sine qua non of the Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The specific content and format of the letter of credit were thus secondary, non-essential terms of the Agreement.  As discussed above, only disagreement as to such terms is fatal under Article 1359.  The problem here is that the text of the Agreement does not indicate the existence of a disagreement, or even that the parties agreed to leave the specifics of the letter of credit open for future negotiation.  Specifically, it is not clear to us that the requirement that a draft of the letter be submitted to SECOMAN for its approval necessarily means that the parties had not already agreed upon the content of the letter.  To the contrary, the requirement may very well have been intended merely to allow SECOMAN the opportunity to ensure that the letter of credit was drafted in accordance with the terms already agreed upon.  Accordingly, it fell upon GE del Caribe to prove to the district court by a preponderance of the evidence that the parties had agreed to postpone their negotiation over the details of the letter of credit.  The district court, however, found that GE del Caribe failed to carry that burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>b. Redrafting of the \"facilitation\" clause and consideration</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>of extrinsic evidence</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The clause in question states:  \"The SELLERS guarantee the following:  ... That the SELLERS will use GE del Caribe as facilitators and sales consultants during this transaction.  SELLERS will not negotiate sale of the lot aforementioned without the written agreement of GE del Caribe.\"   The district court found that this clause was not consistent with the most natural reading of the rest of the Agreement, which otherwise seemed to be a contract for the sale of cotton.  Moreover, SECOMAN presented evidence that the \"facilitation\" clause had been incorrectly drafted by Mr. Aranda, because the actual agreement between Mr. Gordillo and himself provided that SECOMAN would act as facilitator and sales consultant for GE del Caribe, not the other way around.  The district court believed this evidence, and ruled accordingly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GE del Caribe claims, however, that Peruvian law prohibits courts from using extrinsic evidence to rewrite the clear and unambiguous terms of an agreement, and therefore that the district court's determination that the Agreement's \"facilitation\" clause contained a drafting error was ultra vires.   Although agreeing with the court that the \"facilitation\" clause was not consistent with the view that the Agreement was a contract of sale, GE del Caribe argues that the clause means what it says, that the court could not ignore the inconsistency, and thus that the only legally permissible conclusion to be drawn from the inconsistency was that the Agreement was not a contract of sale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GE del Caribe is correct in stating that Peruvian law does not permit a court to rewrite the clear and unambiguous terms of a contract;  however, Peruvian law does permit a court to inquire into the common intention of the parties if the terms of the contract are unclear or ambiguous.  Contrary to GE del Caribe's assertion, several of the Agreement's provisions are ambiguous and confusing.  The source of the problem is evident.  GE del Caribe's argument is premised on the erroneous assumption that a contractual provision is ambiguous only when its words are literally unclear.  To the contrary, contractual provisions may be ambiguous, even if their words are otherwise clear, if their meaning is placed in question by the context in which they are found.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to explain our conclusion, we review some basic concepts of Peruvian contractual hermeneutics.  Pursuant to C. Civ. art. 1352, \"[c]ontracts are perfected by the consent of the parties, except for those which, in addition, must observe the form required by law under penalty of nullity.\"   Thus, Peruvian law does not require any particular form for contracts, except for certain specific types of contracts that are not relevant here.  Instead, the Peruvian Civil Code contains a number of provisions designed to guide the parties (and the courts) in the interpretation of contracts, no matter what their form.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most basic of these provisions are C. Civ. arts. 168, 169, and 170, which regulate the interpretation of all \"juridical acts,\" including contracts.  In particular, Article 168 provides that \"[a] legal act must be interpreted in accordance with its content and with the principle of good faith,\" Article 169 provides that \"[a] clause in a legal act is interpreted in the light of the other clauses, and those clauses which are dubious are ascribed the meaning arising from the whole,\" and Article 170 provides that \"[s]tatements that have several meanings must be understood to have the meaning that is most suitable to the nature and object of the legal act.\"   In addition, there are a number of hermeneutic rules that are specifically applicable to contracts.  For example, C. Civ. art. 1361 provides that \"[c]ontracts are binding as to what is expressed in them.  It is presumed that the statements expressed in a contract reflect the common will of the parties, and whomever denies [that the statements do reflect the common will] must prove it.\"   Moreover, C. Civ. art. 1362 emphasizes that \"[c]ontracts must be negotiated, executed, and performed according to the rules of good faith and the common intent of the parties.\"   The principle of good faith has been interpreted to imply, among other things, the principle of conservation of contracts, which requires that contracts be interpreted whenever possible in such a way as to preserve their validity.  See Manuel Miranda-Canales, Derecho de los Contratos [The Law of Contracts ], at 33-34 (Lima, Peru 1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As GE del Caribe correctly states, the theory underlying these provisions is known as the objectivist theory of interpretation.  See Fernando Vidal-Ramrez, Tratado de Derecho Civil [Treatise on Civil Law ], Tome III, Vol.  I, at 395 (Lima, Peru 1990);  see generally M. de la Puente y Lavalle, El Contrato en General, Pt. 1, Tome 1, at 121-52 (from which much of the following discussion is derived).  However, GE's interpretation of the objectivist approach is incorrect.  As noted above, although under Peruvian law a contract is perfected by the consent of the parties, see C. Civ. art. 1352, consent as a mere subjective mental state has no legal effect.  Instead, some outward sign of consent, some declaration of the common will of the parties is required.  Unfortunately, the possibility then arises that the declaration of will may not accurately reflect the subjective common will of the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Various theories have been developed in order to resolve the problems that may be caused by this discrepancy.  The two most influential theories, the subjectivist and the objectivist, seem also to be diametrically opposed to each other.  The subjectivist theory requires the parties to subjectively consent to the contract, and treats the declaration of will merely as evidence of the subjective will of the parties.  In contrast, pursuant to the pure version of the objectivist theory, the declaration of will prevails over the subjective common will of the parties, so that if the declaration appears to indicate that the parties consented to the contract, the contract will be upheld even if the parties had not, in fact, had the requisite subjective intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although GE del Caribe claims that Peru has adopted the \"pure\" version of the objectivist theory, that is clearly not the case.  To the contrary, the provisions of the Peruvian Civil Code reflect a less strict version of the objectivist theory, sometimes referred to as the \"reliance\" theory.  See M. de la Puente y Lavalle, El Contrato en General, Pt. 1, Tome 1, at 149-51 (describing the \"teora de la confianza\");  see also Vidal-Ramrez, Tratado de Derecho Civil, at 374-78.  In particular, Article 1361 establishes only a rebuttable presumption that the declaration expressed in the contract reflects the common will of the parties.  \"This approach conserves the benefits of the [objectivist] system, and, in particular, its security, but it also leaves the way open for the interpreter to determine the subjective intent of the declarant,\" which furnishes evidence of the common will of the parties.  Id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, notwithstanding GE del Caribe's arguments to the contrary, it is simply not true that Peruvian law bars courts from considering evidence extrinsic to the text of an ambiguous or unclear contract.  A contract is interpreted as a whole (not as a series of disjointed, independent clauses), and in light of its nature and purpose.  See C. Civ. arts. 169, 170.  Consequently, when an individual clause appears to be inconsistent with the others and with the purpose of the contract, a court is empowered to inquire further into the common will of the parties.  In doing so, the court operates under a presumption that the text of the clause in question reflects the common will of the parties, but the presumption may be rebutted by evidence to the contrary as to the common will of the parties.  See C. Civ. art. 1361.  A fortiori, that evidence can only be evidence that is extrinsic to the contract.  If the evidence is sufficient to rebut the Article 1361 presumption, the court may enforce the terms of the contract as it finds that they were agreed to, rather than as they were written.  See Lavalle-Zago, Contratos at 197-98.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With regard to the case at hand, we agree with the district court's conclusion that the \"facilitation\" clause was not consistent with the rest of the contract.  The contract was entitled \"Agreement to Purchase,\" and labeled the parties as \"BUYERS\" and \"SELLERS.\"   Most of the other clauses in the contract were consistent with the interpretation that the Agreement was, in fact, a contract for the sale of cotton.  The first sentence in the facilitation clause, however, indicates that SECOMAN is to use GE del Caribe as a facilitator and sales consultant, which, as both parties agree, is difficult to reconcile with the view that the Agreement is a sales contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are at least two alternative interpretations of this discrepancy, the one advocated by SECOMAN and adopted by the district court, and the one espoused by GE del Caribe.  As one commentator has noted with regard to Article 168, courts are not required to interpret words literally, \"when such an interpretation would lead to [an] absurd [result] or to contradiction.\"   LavalleZago, Contratos at 194.  In this case, both parties' interpretations may lead to internal contradictions:  SECOMAN's interpretation appears to be contradicted by the first sentence of the facilitation clause, while GE del Caribe's interpretation appears to be contradicted by the title of the Agreement and the nomenclature of the parties used therein.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regardless of which interpretation is correct, we find that the meaning of the facilitation clause was sufficiently contentious to make it necessary for the district court to receive any evidence that was probative of the common will of the parties.  In this regard, we find no merit in GE del Caribe's claim that the subsequent conduct of the parties may not be used by a court in interpreting a contract.  To the contrary, when the meaning of a contract is unclear, \"the entire behavior of the parties must be observed, before, during, and even after the conclusion of the contract.\"   Max Arias-Schreiber, Cdigo Civil Peruano de 1984 [Peruvian Civil Code of 1984 ], Tome I, at 89-90 (Lima, Peru 1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Findings of Fact</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A single reading of the Agreement suggests that the parties intended to enter into some sort of binding contract.  As noted before, the Agreement was entitled \"Agreement to Purchase,\" labeled the parties \"BUYERS\" and \"SELLERS,\" indicated the price and quantity of the cotton being offered, expressed the parties' various guarantees and obligations in imperative language, and was signed by the President and Managing Director of GE del Caribe and SECOMAN, respectively.  At first blush, the Agreement appears to be a contract for the sale of cotton.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon examining the Agreement more closely, however, that initial impression is placed in doubt.  For example, the first sentence of the Agreement states that the parties are agreeing to \"initiate this agreement to purchase,\" which could lead one to question whether the Agreement was merely designed to pave the way to further negotiations.  Similarly, the Agreement does not literally state that the sellers will sell the cotton, or that the buyers will buy it.  Instead, the Agreement indicates that \"[t]he SELLERS guarantee ... [t]hat they have available to sell a total of 1000 metric tons of PIMA cotton,\" and that \"[t]he BUYERS agree ... that they will produce a letter of credit (negotiable) with due diligence.\"   On the basis of the text alone, it is not possible to establish with certainty that the Agreement contemplates the immediate sale of cotton to GE del Caribe.  Moreover, as we have discussed above, it is very difficult to reconcile the text of the facilitation clause with the view that the Agreement is a contract for the sale of cotton.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court was faced with the task of making sense of this unclear text.  GE del Caribe contends that, upon determining that the text alone was insufficient to establish the existence of a contract of sale, the court should have ruled that there was no contract.  As we have explained, however, when a court is faced with a text such as this, the principle of conservation of contracts directs the court to look beyond the four corners of the contract for evidence of the common will of the parties.  After all, one conclusion that can be drawn with confidence from the text itself is that the parties intended the Agreement to be binding.  As GE del Caribe correctly points out, that does not necessarily mean that the Agreement is a binding contract, because the terms of the Agreement must comply with the requirements established by Peruvian contract law.  It does, however, mean that the court may presume that the Agreement is a contract, and therefore investigate further to determine what the specific terms of the contract might be.  During such an inquiry, moreover, the party claiming that the Agreement is not a contract bears the burden of proof.  See C. Civ. art. 1361.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing the evidence that the district court had before it, we conclude that its finding that the Agreement to Purchase was a binding contract for the sale of cotton was not clearly erroneous.  First, there is substantial evidence indicating that both SECOMAN and GE del Caribe perceived themselves to be bound by the Agreement and acted accordingly.  Indeed, it would be difficult to characterize the evidence that GE del Caribe deposited $100,000 in Mr. Gordillo's bank account, or that Mr. Aranda made a substantial effort to obtain a confirmed letter of credit, as indicating anything but that the parties perceived the Agreement to be binding.  In addition, GE del Caribe sent SECOMAN a fax ratifying the Agreement, stating that Mr. Aranda \"is authorized by GE del Caribe to negotiate and conclude business deals such as the one we have concluded on March 24 with your company.\"  (Emphasis supplied).  GE del Caribe's decision to send SECOMAN a letter of credit, albeit one that did not comply with the Agreement, also tends to undermine the claim that it did not consider the Agreement to have any binding force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the conclusion that the contract was specifically one for the sale of cotton is supported by the text of the Agreement and by the testimony of the plaintiffs and their legal experts, which the district court found credible.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  For example, we perceive no error in the district court's determination that the clause stating that the \"[c]ost offered per pound:  $1.58 USD\" provided the sale price, or in the finding that the reference to 1000 tons of cotton being available indicated that the quantity of cotton sold was 1000 tons.  The court heard testimony indicating that these price and quantity terms were the terms of SECOMAN's offer, and that GE del Caribe accepted the offer by signing the Agreement.  The fact that the Agreement uses the terms \"cost offered\" and \"availability\" rather than \"price for sale\" and \"quantity sold\" does not necessarily imply that the Agreement was not a contract of sale.  Moreover, the Agreement was typewritten by a non-lawyer who, to judge from the fact that he could not wait until the following working day, was apparently in a hurry to close the deal.  We thus find that there was sufficient evidence before the court to allow it to conclude that the Agreement contained price and quantity terms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the findings as to the delivery term are perfectly consistent with the Civil Code's default provisions.  See C. Civ. arts. 1552, 1553.  In particular, the Code provides that, absent a stipulation to the contrary, a good is delivered by making available to the buyer at the place where it is located.  See C. Civ. art. 1553.  Accordingly, SECOMAN's agreement to make the cotton available and ready to ship was sufficient to comply with its contractual obligation to deliver the cotton.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also heard testimony indicating that Mr. Aranda had mis-drafted the facilitation clause, erroneously transposing the names of GE del Caribe and SECOMAN.  GE del Caribe argues that such testimony was inherently unreliable, since the resulting clause would be internally inconsistent.  We disagree.  The resulting clause would read as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p>That GE del Caribe will use SELLERS as facilitators and sales consultants during this transaction.  SELLERS will not negotiate sale of the lot aforementioned without the written agreement of GE del Caribe.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's reading is not implausible.  Indeed, far from being internally incoherent, the resulting clause is consistent with a contract whereby SECOMAN sells cotton to GE del Caribe, which then resells the cotton.  According to the district court's understanding of this aspect of the Agreement, although Mr. Aranda had some potential buyers in mind, SECOMAN agreed to assist GE del Caribe in its efforts to resell the cotton because of its greater expertise in the cotton market.  GE del Caribe, however, retained final authority to approve or reject any offer from a potential buyer.  Given the evidence heard at trial, we cannot say that it was clear error for the district court to find that this was the deal agreed to by Mr. Aranda and Mr. Gordillo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, it was not clear error for the district court to find that the Agreement required GE del Caribe to submit a confirmed letter of credit, based on evidence that, as a matter of customary practice in international trade and finance, a letter of credit will not be treated as negotiable unless it is confirmed by a bank.  Based on this evidence, as well as on evidence that GE's policy is never to accept an unconfirmed letter of credit because it is not negotiable, the court also found that GE del Caribe knew of this customary practice and thus knew that the Agreement required the letter of credit to be confirmed.  We find the evidence sufficient to support the court's conclusions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, GE del Caribe failed to show that the Agreement was not a sales contract.  Although GE del Caribe presented some evidence to the contrary, the evidence on SECOMAN's side was not so unreliable as to make it unreasonable for the district court to give it credit.  Moreover, although GE del Caribe has focused on arguing that the Agreement was not a binding contract, it has also hinted that the Agreement might have been binding after all, but only as part of a multilateral barter trade agreement, rather than as a simple contract of sale.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Admittedly, GE del Caribe's proposed interpretation of the Agreement is plausible, but it is not our province to make findings of fact.  More importantly, even if the Agreement had been a barter trade contract, GE del Caribe failed to show that it would not have required GE del Caribe to produce the letter of credit.  Given that SECOMAN's cause of action arises out of GE's willful failure to produce a negotiable letter of credit, it is unclear whether GE's proposed reading of the Agreement would lead to a different result in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we address GE del Caribe's argument that the Agreement was invalid because its purpose was unlawful.  Article 1403 of the Civil Code provides that the \"obligation that is the object of the contract must be legitimate.\"   We agree that under Peruvian law, a contract for an unlawful purpose is void.  However, as GE del Caribe admits, nothing on the face of the Agreement indicates that the Agreement had an illegal purpose.  Instead, GE del Caribe's argument is based on the plaintiff's testimony indicating that SECOMAN requested payment in the form of a letter of credit so that it could circumvent Peru's foreign exchange and tax laws.  GE del Caribe specifically claims that SECOMAN violated a Peruvian law that requires exporters to deposit any proceeds from their sales abroad in the government-owned Central Bank, which converts the proceeds to Peruvian currency at a rate that is usually less favorable than the market exchange rate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the evidence did show that the purpose of arranging for payment by means of a letter of credit was to permit SECOMAN to choose an advantageous time to convert the letter into currency, GE del Caribe has failed to establish that such a strategy is, in fact, illegal under Peruvian law.  For example, it is not clear that the duty to deposit the proceeds from export transactions extends to forms of payment other than payment in currency, such as payment by letter of credit.  Moreover, SECOMAN presented evidence that even when payment is made in currency, the duty to deposit the proceeds does not arise until the transaction is consummated.  Because SECOMAN had not shipped any cotton when GE del Caribe breached the Agreement, it does not appear that SECOMAN was yet under a duty to deposit the $100,000 in the Central Bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Damages</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reviewing the district court's findings as to damages for clear error, we find only one.  The district court's award of damages to SECOMAN apparently failed to take into account the $100,000 that was paid up front to Mr. Gordillo as a deposit on the Agreement.  The district court did not make an explicit finding that the deposit was not to be considered an advance on the payment due under the Agreement, and we would consider any such finding to be clearly erroneous.  We will therefore reduce the award of damages contained in the district court's judgment by $100,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject, however, GE's contention that the award of damages should be reduced by the amount of taxes that SECOMAN would have had to pay on the proceeds from this sale.  Such a reduction might have been in order only upon proof that SECOMAN would not be liable for payment of taxes on its award, see Atlas Truck Leasing, Inc. v. First N.H. Banks, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"481322\"><a href=\"/opinion/481322/atlas-truck-leasing-inc-v-first-nh-banks-inc-formerly-first-bancorp/\"><span class=\"volume\">808</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">902</span></a></span>, 905 (1st Cir.1987), and no such proof was provided.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also do not agree with GE del Caribe's argument that the district court erred both in determining that GE del Caribe acted with dolus and in its calculation of damages.  A party acts with dolus when that party willfully fails to perform an obligation.  See C. Civ. art. 1318.  A determination that a breaching party acted with dolus has a substantial effect upon the damages available to the injured party.  Any person breaching a contract is \"responsible for compensating the losses and damages [proximately] caused by its failure to perform.\"   See C. Civ. art. 1321.  However, a person who breaches a contract with dolus is also liable for any unforeseeable damages caused by the breach.  See id.   GE del Caribe correctly states that a finding of dolus requires a finding that the breaching party intentionally breached an obligation that it knew was binding, and that a court must analyze the subjective intent of the breaching party in order to make a finding of dolus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its opinion, however, the district court found that GE del Caribe \"knew that by failing to tender a negotiable letter of credit, it was performing an act contrary to the contractual obligations it had assumed\" under the Agreement.  The court's conclusion was based on evidence indicating that SECOMAN had informed GE del Caribe of its pressing need for the negotiable letter of credit, that at least some GE del Caribe employees were aware that the Agreement required payment to be made by means of an irrevocable letter of credit, and that GE del Caribe was concerned about the significant decline in the price of cotton.  The court also found the letter sent by GE del Caribe on June 11, 1990, in which GE del Caribe claimed that SECOMAN's rejection of the terms of the letter of credit \"release[d] and excuse[d][it] from any and all performance [under the Agreement],\" to be evidence probative of bad faith.  In particular, the letter indicates that GE del Caribe felt the need to find a way to be released from the Agreement, which in turn supports the implication that it knew itself to be bound by the Agreement.  Reviewing these findings only for clear error, with due deference to the trier of fact's greater ability to gauge the demeanor and credibility of the witnesses, we cannot say that the district court's findings were clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GE del Caribe also raised several other challenges to the district court's calculation of damages, including claims that the court should have reduced the award of damages by the amount by which the Peruvian foreign exchange restrictions would have reduced SECOMAN's profits, that the court should not have based its award of damages on the assumption that SECOMAN had actually purchased 1000 tons of cotton, that there was no evidence from which the court could conclude that SECOMAN suffered losses on \"cover sales,\" that the court failed to deduct $200,000 attributable to Mr. Manuel Bentin's partial ownership of the cotton, and that the court should not have compensated SECOMAN for the liability it incurred when it breached two subsequent contracts for the sale of cotton.  We affirm the district court on these points, substantially for the reasons expressed in its opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Attorney's Fees</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GE del Caribe contends that the district court's award under P.R. R. Civ. P. 44.1(d) was erroneous because Puerto Rico law was inapplicable to this case.  In the alternative, GE del Caribe claims that, even if Rule 44 were applicable to this case, the district court abused its discretion in finding that GE del Caribe had litigated in an obstinate manner.  We disagree with both claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In general terms, a federal court sitting in diversity applies the substantive law of the forum state and federal procedural rules.

Second, if a choice of law must be made, for example, because a contractual choice-of-law clause is at issue or because a tort was committed in another jurisdiction, the district court applies the law that would be applied under the conflict of laws rules of the forum state.

Co. v. Williams, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"275857\"><a href=\"/opinion/275857/maryland-casualty-company-and-united-services-automobile-association-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">389</span></a></span>, 393 n. 1 (5th Cir.1967).  Contrary to GE's contention, therefore, the fact that Rule 44.1 is considered \"substantive\" for Erie purposes does not bar a finding that it is \"procedural\" for conflict of laws purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the case at hand, we are faced with the question whether, pursuant to section 122 of the Restatement, the courts of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico would apply Rule 44.1 in a suit otherwise subject to the laws of another state or country.  Although we have found no Puerto Rico decision directly on point, we are confident that the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico would conclude that Rule 44.1 is a \"local law rule[ ] prescribing how litigation shall be conducted.\"   Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws &#167; 122.  Rule 44.1 does not modify the parties' substantive rights under the law.  Instead, it serves the institutional concerns of the courts by allowing the imposition of sanctions upon parties who abuse the judicial process.  After all, \"[t]he purpose behind [Rules 44.1 and 44.3] is to penalize 'a losing party that because of his stubbornness, obstinacy, rashness, and insistent frivolous attitude has forced the other party to needlessly assume the pains, costs, efforts, and inconveniences of a litigation.' \"  Dopp, 38 F.3d at 1253 (quoting Fernandez Marino Y Otros v. San Juan Cement Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\">713</span></span>, 718 (1987)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion is reinforced by an evaluation of the four factors listed by the Restatement to be taken into consideration in making this determination:  (1) \"whether the issue is one to which the parties are likely to have given thought in the course of entering into the transaction\";  (2) \"whether the issue is one whose resolution would be likely to affect the ultimate result in this case\";  (3) \"whether the precedents have tended consistently to classify the issue as 'procedural' or 'substantive' for choice-of-law purposes\";  and (4) \"whether an effort to apply the rules of the judicial administration of another state would impose an undue burden upon the forum.\"   See Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws &#167; 122 cmt. a.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, there is no evidence whatsoever that the parties intended to exclude the applicability of Rule 44.1, or to make applicable to this case the litigation rules of another forum.  Second, we do not agree that \"the issue is one whose resolution is likely to affect the ultimate result of the case,\" Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws &#167; 122 cmt. a, because, although the imposition of sanctions under Rule 44.1 does entail the payment of a monetary penalty, the penalty is not a remedy arising out of the cause of action.  Third, laws providing for awards of attorneys' fees have not been consistently classified as either \"procedural\" or \"substantive\" for choice-of-law purposes, either in Puerto Rico or elsewhere.

United States Fire Ins., 236 N.J.Super. 349, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">565</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1113</span></span>, 1120 (1990) (Michigan counsel fee law held procedural and therefore inapplicable to suit brought in New Jersey state court), with Aries v.

Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws &#167; 122 cmt. a. For example, this court has not been able to determine what the Peruvian law of civil procedure would provide in a situation such as the one at hand.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  In any case, Peruvian civil procedure is not as easily transplanted as its substantive law of obligations and contracts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finding that the district court did not err as a matter of law in determining that GE del Caribe's conduct in this case should evaluated under Rule 44.1, we turn next to the question whether the district court abused its discretion in determining that GE del Caribe behaved in a manner deserving of sanctions under that rule.  See Dopp, 38 F.3d at 1253 (explaining that appellate review of orders imposing sanctions under Rule 44.1 is for abuse of discretion).  Rule 44.1(d) provides, in pertinent part:  \"In the event any party or its lawyer has acted obstinately or frivolously, the court shall, in its judgment, impose on such person the payment of a sum for attorney's fees which the court decides corresponds to such conduct.\"  \"The purpose behind [Rule 44.1] is to penalize 'a losing party that because of his stubbornness, obstinacy, rashness, and insistent frivolous attitude has forced the other party to needlessly assume the pains, costs, efforts, and inconveniences of a litigation.' \"  Dopp, 38 F.3d at 1253 (quoting Fernandez Marino Y Otros v. San Juan Cement Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\">713</span></span>, 718 (1987)).  For the reasons already discussed above, we have affirmed the district court's determination that GE del Caribe breached its obligations under the Agreement in bad faith.  A finding of bad faith implies that GE del Caribe was aware that it was breaching its obligations under the Agreement when, in June 1990, it attempted unilaterally to terminate the Agreement.  We thus find no abuse of discretion in the district court's further conclusion that GE del Caribe's complete denial of liability, by forcing the plaintiffs and the court to undergo the expense of litigating a full trial, was an obstinate posture deserving of sanctions under Rule 44.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's judgment on the issue of liability, but reduce the award of damages by $100,000.  Furthermore, we affirm the district court's imposition of sanctions under P.R. R. Civ. P. 44.1.  Costs are awarded to appellees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The cited work is Volume IX of a collection entitled Para Leer el Cdigo Civil [In Order to Read the Civil Code ], published by the Editorial Fund of the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru.  All quotations from this text, as well as from the other cited Peruvian legal texts, are our own translations</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> For example, Article 1403's requirement that a contract must have a legitimate purpose is an imperative norm because it admits of no exceptions, while Article 1552, which states that the object of a sale must be delivered immediately after the contract of sale has been executed, is an optional norm because the parties may provide for a different time of delivery.  See generally M. de la Puente y Lavalle, El Contrato en General, Pt. 1, Tome 1, at 275-80</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Article 1552 provides that \"[t]he good must be delivered immediately after execution of the contract, except for any delay resulting from its nature or otherwise stipulated.\"   Article 1553 provides, in turn, that \"[a]bsent a stipulation, the good must be delivered at the place where it is located at the time the contract was executed.  If the good were [of] uncertain [quantity], delivery shall be made at the seller's domicile, once it[s] [quantity] has been determined.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The Agreement provided, in pertinent part, that \"[t]he BUYERS agree to the following:  ... They will produce a letter of credit (negotiable) with due diligence,\" and that \"[t]hey will submit to the SELLER a draft of the letter credit for their approval.  Specifically on terms and conditions.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Notwithstanding the similarities, the \"reliance\" theory is not another name for the subjectivist theory.  One major difference is that the interpretive task is subject to the principle of good faith, embodied in Articles 168 and 1362, which implicitly recognizes the difficulty in determining the subjective intent of the parties.  The principle of good faith thus legitimizes the interpreter's reasonable reliance on the declaration of will as a guide to the parties' common will.  Another important difference is that the evidence that may be used to rebut the presumption established by Article 1362 is evidence of the common will of the parties, as opposed to each side's own subjective intent</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> During trial, therefore, GE del Caribe bore the burden of proving that the Agreement was an incomplete, and consequently non-binding, contract.  Conversely, SECOMAN bore the burden of proving that the \"facilitation\" clause had been mis-drafted</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Although pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 44.1, the testimony of foreign legal experts is generally admissible for the purpose of assisting the court in its determination of foreign law, the finder of fact is entitled to make its own assessment of the credibility of such experts</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The evidence showed that barter trade agreements are commonly utilized by multi-national companies, such as GE Trading Co.  (GE del Caribe's sister company), to support their overseas sales, particularly to countries with high rates of inflation or with unfavorable currency conversion rates, by guaranteeing payment in dollars rather than in local currency.  The structure of these transactions is fairly uniform.  A multi-national company (A) sells certain products to an overseas customer (B), but, instead of receiving payment in the customer's national currency, the customer turns the payment over to a third company (C), which is located in the same country but is engaged in the export business.  In exchange for the transfer of funds in national currency from B, C assigns to A the proceeds of its international sales, denominated in dollars</p>\n        <p>GE del Caribe's suggestion is that the Agreement in this case specified the relationship between A and C, where A is GE del Caribe, and C is SECOMAN.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> In its brief, GE del Caribe states that \"Peru does have a procedural 'loser pay[s]' rule which has no applicability to a trial in Puerto Rico.\"  We note that, aside from the fact that GE del Caribe fails to provide a citation to that rule, GE's view of its applicability is not entirely consistent with its claim that Rule 44.1 is \"substantive.\"   Peru's \"loser pays\" rule, which presumably always provides an award of attorney's fees to the prevailing party in a suit, has a much better claim to being \"substantive\" than a rule awarding attorney's fees only as a sanction for frivolous litigation.  After all, a \"loser pays\" rule could be conceived of as adding an award of attorney's fees to the recovery provided by the underlying cause of action.  If both Rule 44.1 and the unnamed Peruvian rule were \"substantive\" for conflict of laws purposes, we would be forced to choose between them, and it is not obvious that we would choose Rule 44.1 over the Peruvian rule</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
