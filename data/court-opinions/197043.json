This  time,  defendants-\r\n\nappellants appeal the district court's denial of their motion for\r\n\nsummary judgment based on qualified immunity.  The district court\r\n\nfound the  qualified  immunity defense  to  have been  waived  by\r\n\ndefendants'   failure  to   raise  the   issue  earlier   in  the\r\n\nproceedings.     We  affirm   the  district  court's   denial  of\r\n\ndefendants-appellants summary judgment motion.  We agree with the\r\n\nfinding of waiver to the extent that the district court found the\r\n\nqualified immunity defense waived for the pre-trial stage, and we\r\n\nreverse to the  extent that it found  the defense waived for  the\r\n\npurposes of trial.\r\n\n                          I.  BACKGROUND\r                                    I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          On June  27,  1989, plaintiff-appellee  H ctor  Guzm n-\r\n\nRivera  was convicted  of  murder  and  sentenced  to  119  years\r\n\nimprisonment.  Guzm n's father, H ctor Guzm n-Fern ndez, began an\r\n\nindependent investigation into  the murder for which his  son had\r\n\nbeen  convicted  and  eventually  uncovered  proof   of  Guzm n's\r\n\ninnocence.   Guzm n was released  on June  15, 1990.   Guzm n and\r\n\nmembers  of  his  family  subsequently  filed  suit  against  the\r\n\nSecretary  of  Justice  of  Puerto  Rico  and  two other  Justice\r\n\nDepartment officials under  42 U.S.C.   1983.   The suit  alleged\r\n\nthat the  defendants  had failed  to reinvestigate  the facts  of\r\n\nGuzm n's case with  adequate speed  and to move  for his  release\r\n\neven after his innocence had been established.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n          In Guzm n-Rivera  v. Rivera-Cruz,  29 F.3d 3  (1st Cir.\r                                                    \r\n\n1994) (Guzm n I) we vacated the district court's grant of summary\r                         \r\n\njudgment  for defendants  on statute  of limitations  grounds and\r\n\nremanded.   In Guzm n-Rivera v. Rivera-Cruz, 55 F.3d 26 (1st Cir.\r                                                     \r\n\n1995)  (Guzm n II), we  reviewed the  district court's  denial of\r                           \r\n\ndefendants'  motion  for summary  judgment  on absolute  immunity\r\n\ngrounds.    We found  that the  defendants  are not  \"entitled to\r\n\nabsolute immunity for any delays or inadequacies in their conduct\r\n\nof the investigation,\"  but that \"they are  absolutely immune for\r\n\ntheir  post-investigation  failure  to  go  into  court  to  seek\r\n\nGuzm n's release.\"  Id. at 28.\r                                 \r\n\n          The case is  now before us again.   For the third time,\r\n\nwe  are presented with an appeal from the district court's ruling\r\n\non a  summary judgment motion.   This time, the appeal  is from a\r\n\ndenial of  summary judgment on  qualified immunity grounds.   The\r\n\nsummary judgment motion was  denied by the district court  on the\r\n\ngrounds of  waiver; \"[d]efendants  have had ample  opportunity to\r\n\nraise   this  defense  during   the  district  court's  prolonged\r\n\nproceedings as well as through two appeals . . . .  Thus, we find\r\n\nthat defendants'  waived the qualified immunity  defense.\"  Order\r\n\nof the District Court, August 4, 1995. \r\n\n                     II.  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r                               II.  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\n          We  review  the denial  of  summary  judgment de  novo,\r                                                                          \r\n\napplying  the same  decisional  standard as  the district  court.\r\n\nWyner v. North Am. Specialty Ins. Co., 78 F.3d 752, 754 (1st Cir.\r                                               \r\n\n1996).   Summary judgment is appropriate where the record, viewed\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nin  the light most favorable  to the nonmoving  party, reveals no\r\n\ngenuine issue as to  any material fact, and  the moving party  is\r\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Id.\r                                                       \r\n\n                       III.  LEGAL ANALYSIS\r                                 III.  LEGAL ANALYSIS\r\n\n          The  doctrine  of   qualified  immunity  offers  public\r\n\nofficials a defense  against liability  under 42  U.S.C.    1983.\r\n\nSee, e.g., G mez v. Toledo, 446 U.S. 635, 639 (1980).  T   h   e\r                                    \r\n\nqualified immunity  defense exists  not only to  shield officials\r\n\nfrom  liability for damages, but  also to protect  them from \"the\r\n\ngeneral  costs of subjecting officials  to the risks  of trial --\r\n\ndistraction   of  officials   from  their   governmental  duties,\r\n\ninhibition of discretionary action, and deterrence of able people\r\n\nfrom  public service.\"  Harlow  v. Fitzgerald, 457  U.S. 800, 816\r                                                       \r\n\n(1982).\r\n\n          Because the doctrine  of qualified immunity  recognizes\r\n\nthat  litigation is costly to defendants, officials may plead the\r\n\ndefense  at various  stages  in the  proceedings.   Specifically,\r\n\ndefendants  may  raise a  claim  of qualified  immunity  at three\r\n\ndistinct stages  of the litigation.   First defendants  may raise\r\n\nthe defense on  the pleadings, in a  motion to dismiss.   \"Unless\r\n\nthe plaintiff's allegations state a claim of violation of clearly\r\n\nestablished  law,  a  defendant pleading  qualified  immunity  is\r\n\nentitled  to  dismissal before  the  commencement  of discovery.\"\r\n\nMitchell  v. Forsyth, 472  U.S. 511,  526 (1985).   Second,  if a\r                              \r\n\ndefendant cannot obtain a  dismissal on the pleadings, he  or she\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nmay  move  for  summary  judgment  and  \"is  entitled  to summary\r\n\njudgment  if discovery  fails to  uncover evidence  sufficient to\r\n\ncreate  a genuine  issue  as to  whether  the defendant  in  fact\r\n\ncommitted  those acts.\"  Id.  Finally, the defense is, of course,\r                                      \r\n\navailable at trial.  See Behrens v. Pelletier,    U.S.   , 116 S.\r                                                       \r\n\nCt. 834,  839 (1996); Unwin  v. Campbell, 863  F.2d 124,  132 n.5\r                                                  \r\n\n(1st Cir.  1988); Kennedy v. City of Cleveland, 797 F.2d 297, 299\r                                                        \r\n\n(6th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1103 (1987).\r                                       \r\n\n          Furthermore, \"a  district court's denial of  a claim of\r\n\nqualified immunity, to  the extent that it  turns on an  issue of\r\n\nlaw, is an appealable  'final decision' within the meaning  of 28\r\n\nU.S.C.    1291 notwithstanding the absence  of a final judgment.\"\r\n\nMitchell, 472 U.S. at 530.  This is so regardless  of whether the\r                  \r\n\ndenial takes place at the pleadings stage or at summary judgment.\r\n\nSee  Zayas-Green  v. Casaine,  906 F.2d  18,  22 (1st  Cir. 1990)\r                                      \r\n\n(citing Mitchell, 472  U.S. at 526-27);  Valiente v. Rivera,  966\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.2d 21, 23 (1st Cir. 1992).\r\n\n          The  right to  immediate appeal  of a  district court's\r\n\ndenial  of a  motion  for  summary  judgment based  on  qualified\r\n\nimmunity was recently confirmed in  Behrens v. Pelletier,    U.S.\r                                                                  \r\n\n  , 116  S.  Ct. 834.   In  that  case, the  Court  noted that  a\r\n\ndistrict  court's rejection  of a  qualified immunity  defense at\r\n\neither  the dismissal or summary judgment phase is a final order,\r\n\nand stated that \"[s]ince  an unsuccessful appeal from the  denial\r\n\nof  dismissal cannot possibly render the later denial of a motion\r\n\nfrom summary  judgment  any  less  'final,'\"  an  appeal  at  the\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\ndismissal stage does not limit the right to appeal at the summary\r\n\njudgment stage.  Id. at 839.\r                              \r\n\n          These  considerable  rights  to  raise and  appeal  the\r\n\ndefense  of  qualified immunity  are  not,  however, unlimited.  \r\n\nQualified immunity is an affirmative defense, and  the \"burden of\r\n\npleading  it rests with the defendant.\"   G mez, 446 U.S. at 640.\r                                                         \r\n\n\"Since immunity  must be  affirmatively pleaded, it  follows that\r\n\nfailure to do so can work a waiver of the defense.\"  Kennedy, 797\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d at 300.\r\n\n          The Sixth Circuit,  faced with the  issue of waiver  at\r\n\nthe  pleadings stage  in English  v. Dyke,  23 F.3d  1086 (1994),\r                                                   \r\n\nconcluded that \"a failure  to assert the defense in  a pre-answer\r\n\nmotion to dismiss waives the right to raise the issue in a second\r\n\npre-answer  motion to dismiss.\"   Id. at 1090.   Importantly, the\r                                               \r\n\ncourt  added that  \"[s]uch a  waiver . .  . would  generally only\r\n\nwaive the defense for the stage  at which the defense should have\r\n\nbeen asserted.\"  Id.  The Sixth Circuit case law on which English\r                                                                           \r\n\nrelies evidenced a concern  that the right to move  for dismissal\r\n\non the grounds of qualified immunity and the corresponding  right\r\n\nto appeal can be used for purposes of delay.  See, e.g., Kennedy,\r                                                                          \r\n\n797 F.2d at 301; Yates v. City of Cleveland, 941 F.2d 444, 448-49\r                                                     \r\n\n(6th Cir. 1991).\r\n\n          We share these concerns.  Delay generated  by claims of\r\n\nqualified immunity may work to the disadvantage of the plaintiff.\r\n\nWitnesses  may become unavailable,  memories may  fade, attorneys\r\n\nfees accumulate,  and deserving plaintiffs'  recovery is delayed.\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nSee  Apostol  v. Gallion,  870 F.2d  1335,  1338 (7th  Cir. 1989)\r                                  \r\n\n(\"Defendants  may seek to stall  because they gain  from delay at\r\n\nplaintiffs'   expense,   an   incentive    yielding   unjustified\r\n\nappeals.\").   Delay is also costly to the court system, demanding\r\n\nmore time and energy from the court and retarding the disposition\r\n\nof cases.\r\n\n          We must  balance the  need to protect  public officials\r\n\nfrom frivolous  suits  with  the  need  to  have  cases  resolved\r\n\nexpeditiously.  Without  some limit on the  ability of defendants\r\n\nto raise immunity  issues, any suit  implicating the defenses  of\r\n\nabsolute and qualified immunity faces the possibility of at least\r\n\nthree independent motions for summary judgment:  (i) a motion for\r\n\nsummary judgment on  the non-immunity defenses, (ii) a motion for\r\n\nsummary  judgment  based  on  absolute  immunity,  which  can  be\r\n\nappealed immediately; (iii) a motion for qualified immunity which\r\n\ncan also be  appealed immediately.   The potential  for delay  is\r\n\nconsiderable.   In the instant case, for example, defendants have\r\n\nfiled  two post-discovery  motions for  summary judgment  and one\r\n\nmotion  to dismiss  that was  converted to  a motion  for summary\r\n\njudgment.1\r\n\n          In  order   to  reduce  the  potential   for  abuse  by\r\n\ndefendants, we believe that the defense of qualified immunity may\r\n\nbe deemed to have been waived  if it is not raised in a  diligent\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   Although Fed. R. Civ.  P. 56 states that  defendants may move\r\nfor summary judgment \"at any  time,\" we do not believe that  this\r\nprecludes  us from  establishing  some limits  to the  ability of\r\ndefendants  to use the  protection of qualified  immunity to slow\r\nthe progress of the case.\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nmanner  during  the post-discovery,  pre-trial  phase.   To  find\r\n\notherwise is to invite strategic use of the defense by defendants\r\n\nwho  stand to benefit  from delay.  This  ruling does not inhibit\r\n\nthe  ability  of defendants  to  raise  a  defense  of  qualified\r\n\nimmunity  and benefit from the protections it offers.  Our ruling\r\n\ntoday in no way prevents a defendant from raising  the defense of\r\n\nqualified immunity at summary  judgment, regardless of whether it\r\n\nwas raised prior to discovery.\r\n\n          We, therefore, adopt the  position of the Sixth Circuit\r\n\nthat  the district court has  the discretion to  deny motions for\r\n\nsummary judgment that are not filed in an expeditious manner.\r\n\n            [T]he trial judge retains  discretion not\r\n            only to  set cut off dates  for discovery\r\n            but   to  cut  off  motions  for  summary\r\n            judgment, even those which  may challenge\r\n            the plaintiff's right to  go to trial  on\r\n            the  basis  of   absolute  or   qualified\r\n            immunity.   The quid pro quo  is obvious:\r\n            in exchange for the defendant's  right to\r\n            interrupt the judicial process, the court\r\n            may  expect  a   reasonable  modicum   of\r\n            diligence in the exercise of that right.\r\n\nKennedy, 797  F.2d at  301;   See also English,  23 F.3d  at 1090\r                                                        \r\n\n(\"[T]he  trial court  has  discretion  to  find  a  waiver  if  a\r\n\ndefendant  fails to assert the defense within the time limits set\r\n\nby the court or if the court otherwise finds that a defendant has\r\n\nfailed  to exercise due diligence or has asserted the defense for\r\n\ndilatory purposes.\").\r\n\n          We  add that  district courts  are encouraged  to enter\r\n\nscheduling  orders  to prevent  dilatory tactics  on the  part of\r\n\ndefendants  with qualified immunity defenses.  Absent an abuse of\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\ndiscretion, this court will enforce those scheduling deadlines by\r\n\naffirming a finding of waiver and awarding double costs.\r\n\n                 IV.  APPLICATION OF THE ANALYSIS\r                           IV.  APPLICATION OF THE ANALYSIS\r\n\n          In  the case before  us, defendants-appellants chose to\r\n\nraise the  defense  of qualified  immunity  only at  the  summary\r\n\njudgment stage.   As the  above discussion indicates,  failure to\r\n\nraise  the issue on the  pleadings does not  constitute waiver of\r\n\nthe right to  raise the  defense post-discovery.   Were this  the\r\n\nonly question before us, there would be no waiver.\r\n\n          In  the  instant case,  however, defendants  raised the\r\n\nqualified  immunity defense  very  late in  the pre-trial,  post-\r\n\ndiscovery phase, despite the fact that they had ample opportunity\r\n\nto  have   the  issue  resolved  expeditiously   earlier  in  the\r\n\nproceedings, rather  than generating  additional delay by  filing\r\n\nthis third motion for summary judgment.  The question before this\r\n\ncourt, therefore, is whether  the defendants waived the  right to\r\n\nraise the defense at this stage by failing to do so in a diligent\r                                         \r\n\nmanner  and by  failing to  offer an  explanation for  the delay.\r\n\nUpon  de novo  review,  we hold  that  the defense  of  qualified\r                       \r\n\nimmunity has been waived for the pre-trial stage.\r\n\n          We  note  first,  that because  the  qualified immunity\r\n\ndefense \"depends on the facts peculiarly within the knowledge and\r\n\ncontrol of the defendant[s],\"  G mez 446 U.S.  at 641, we see  no\r                                              \r\n\nreason why  defendants were unable  to raise the  defense earlier\r\n\nthan  they  did.    What  is  more,  they have  not  offered  any\r\n\nexplanation for their delay.\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\n          The   record  shows   that   defendants   had   several\r\n\nopportunities  to  raise  the qualified  immunity  defense  post-\r\n\ndiscovery.   First,  they  could have  filed  a summary  judgment\r\n\nmotion  between the completion of  discovery and the deadline for\r\n\ndispositive motions:  March 15 and March  30, 1993, respectively.\r\n\nDefendants  chose instead to await the outcome of their motion to\r\n\ndismiss (converted to  a motion  for summary  judgment) based  on\r\n\ntime bar and absolute immunity, for which they filed a Memorandum\r\n\nof  Law on  May 5,  1992.   Although the  failure to  include the\r\n\nqualified  immunity defense  in this  initial motion  for summary\r\n\njudgment  does  not,  by  itself, constitute  a  waiver  for  the\r\n\npurposes of  the  current  appeal,  it is  noteworthy  that,  had\r\n\ndefendants  included the  issue  in the  motion and  subsequently\r\n\nargued  all  three defenses  (time  bar,  absolute immunity,  and\r\n\nqualified immunity) on appeal, this Court would have resolved all\r\n\nthree issues in the course of a single appeal.\r\n\n          Second,  the parties  filed a  Joint Pretrial  Order on\r\n\nFebruary  2, 1993.  District  of Puerto Rico  Local Rule 314.3(E)\r\n\nrequires  each party  to  set forth  its  theory in  this  order.\r\n\nDefendants failed to mention qualified  immunity as part of their\r\n\nlegal theory.\r\n\n          Additionally, having  lost in their efforts  to dismiss\r\n\nthe  case  based on  time bar,  defendants  could have  filed for\r\n\nsummary  judgment  based   on  qualified   immunity.     Instead,\r\n\ndefendants waited almost four months until  November 1, 1994, six\r\n\ndays  before trial  was scheduled  to begin,  to file  an \"Urgent\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nMotion for Relief,\" seeking summary judgment on absolute immunity\r\n\ngrounds.  On  appeal, this  Court stated that  \"[w]e are left  to\r\n\nwonder why  absolute immunity was  originally pled as  a defense,\r\n\nabandoned  in  the initial  appeal,  and then  resurrected  as an\r\n\nemergency on  remand.\"  Guzm n II, 55 F.3d at 27.  Because \"[t]he\r                                           \r\n\ndistrict  court nevertheless  denied the  motion on  the merits,\"\r\n\nthis Court did not consider the absolute immunity defense waived.\r\n\nId.  This second  summary judgment motion gave the  defendants an\r             \r\n\nadditional  opportunity   to  raise  the  defense   of  qualified\r\n\nimmunity, but they chose instead to argue only absolute immunity.\r\n\n          On  November 4, 1994, the same day that the trial court\r\n\ndenied  the  motion  for   summary  judgment  based  on  absolute\r\n\nimmunity, defendants filed their  Answer to the Amended Complaint\r\n\nand a Notice of  Appeal.  The qualified immunity  defense appears\r\n\non the scene  for the first time in the  Answer.  Defendants have\r\n\noffered no explanation for  the failure to include  the qualified\r\n\nimmunity  defense in the  motion for summary  judgment filed only\r\n\nthree days  before the  Answer.   It was not  until almost  eight\r\n\nmonths later, on July 21, 1995, that defendants moved -- in their\r\n\nthird  such motion  -- for  summary judgment  based on  qualified\r\n\nimmunity.\r\n\n          As the record indicates, the piecemeal fashion in which\r\n\ndefendants  have brought  forward  their defense  is unduly  time\r\n\nconsuming  for  the courts  and  potentially  prejudicial to  the\r\n\nplaintiff.  Upon de novo review, we therefore find the defense of\r                                  \r\n\nqualified immunity to have  been waived for the current  stage of\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nthe  litigation:   the defense has  been available  to defendants\r\n\nsince  early  in  the  litigation  and,  as  the  district  court\r\n\ncorrectly  found,  the  plaintiff  has  been  prejudiced  by  the\r\n\ndefendants' intentional strategy of delay.\r\n\n          This decision does not imply, however, that the defense\r\n\nhas been waived for other stages of the litigation.   Because the\r\n\ndefense  of  qualified immunity  may  be raised  and  appealed at\r\n\nmultiple stages of the  trial, it would be inappropriate  to find\r\n\nwaiver for  all stages in the  current case.  We  need not decide\r\n\nwhether a sufficient showing of prejudice to the plaintiff  would\r\n\nresult in waiver for all stages: even assuming so arguendo, there\r                                                                    \r\n\nis no such showing in the instant case.  Our decision thus leaves\r\n\ndefendants  free to  present  the qualified  immunity defense  at\r\n\ntrial,  despite the fact that the defense is waived for pre-trial\r\n\npurposes.\r\n\n          We add that defendants' reliance on Valiente v. Rivera,\r                                                                          \r\n\n966 F.2d  21 (1st Cir. 1992),  is misplaced.  In  that case, this\r\n\nCourt ruled that a motion  for summary judgment filed on  the eve\r\n\nof the originally  scheduled trial  date could not  be denied  as\r\n\nuntimely where a new trial date had been scheduled.  Instead, the\r\n\ntimeliness of  the motion had  to be viewed  in light of  the new\r\n\ndate.   Id. at 23.   In this  case, the problem  is not  that the\r                     \r\n\ndefense has filed  a motion on the  eve of trial.  Rather,  it is\r\n\nthat  defendants  have  pursued a  strategy  of  delay  which has\r\n\nprejudiced the plaintiff  and abused  the judicial  process.   We\r\n\nbelieve,  as we  have already  stated, that  some limits  must be\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nplaced  on  the  ability  of  defendants  to  use  their immunity\r\n\ndefenses to frustrate and delay the rights of plaintiffs.\r\n\n                          V.  CONCLUSION\r                                    V.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We affirm  the district  court's finding of  waiver and\r                       affirm\r                             \r\n\ndenial  of defendants' summary judgment motion.  In light of this\r\n\nfinding, we need not  reach the merits of the  qualified immunity\r\n\nclaim.   Considering the intentional delay imposed on the case by\r\n\ndefendants-appellants, we hereby  order defendants-appellants  to\r\n\npay double costs.\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n",

BACKGROUND\r                                    I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          On June  27,  1989, plaintiff-appellee  H ctor  Guzm n-\r\n\nRivera  was convicted  of  murder  and  sentenced  to  119  years\r\n\nimprisonment.  Guzm n's father, H ctor Guzm n-Fern ndez, began an\r\n\nindependent investigation into  the murder for which his  son had\r\n\nbeen  convicted  and  eventually  uncovered  proof   of  Guzm n's\r\n\ninnocence.   Guzm n was released  on June  15, 1990.   Guzm n and\r\n\nmembers  of  his  family  subsequently  filed  suit  against  the\r\n\nSecretary  of  Justice  of  Puerto  Rico  and  two other  Justice\r\n\nDepartment officials under  42 U.S.C.   1983.   The suit  alleged\r\n\nthat the  defendants  had failed  to reinvestigate  the facts  of\r\n\nGuzm n's case with  adequate speed  and to move  for his  release\r\n\neven after his innocence had been established.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n          In Guzm n-Rivera  v.

Delay is also costly to the court system, demanding\r\n\nmore time and energy from the court and retarding the disposition\r\n\nof cases.\r\n\n          We must  balance the  need to protect  public officials\r\n\nfrom frivolous  suits  with  the  need  to  have  cases  resolved\r\n\nexpeditiously.  Without  some limit on the  ability of defendants\r\n\nto raise immunity  issues, any suit  implicating the defenses  of\r\n\nabsolute and qualified immunity faces the possibility of at least\r\n\nthree independent motions for summary judgment:  (i) a motion for\r\n\nsummary judgment on  the non-immunity defenses, (ii) a motion for\r\n\nsummary  judgment  based  on  absolute  immunity,  which  can  be\r\n\nappealed immediately; (iii) a motion for qualified immunity which\r\n\ncan also be  appealed immediately.   The potential  for delay  is\r\n\nconsiderable.   In the instant case, for example, defendants have\r\n\nfiled  two post-discovery  motions for  summary judgment  and one\r\n\nmotion  to dismiss  that was  converted to  a motion  for summary\r\n\njudgment.1\r\n\n          In  order   to  reduce  the  potential   for  abuse  by\r\n\ndefendants, we believe that the defense of qualified immunity may\r\n\nbe deemed to have been waived  if it is not raised in a  diligent\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   Although Fed. R. Civ.  P. 56 states that  defendants may move\r\nfor summary judgment \"at any  time,\" we do not believe that  this\r\nprecludes  us from  establishing  some limits  to the  ability of\r\ndefendants  to use the  protection of qualified  immunity to slow\r\nthe progress of the case.\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nmanner  during  the post-discovery,  pre-trial  phase.   To  find\r\n\notherwise is to invite strategic use of the defense by defendants\r\n\nwho  stand to benefit  from delay.  This  ruling does not inhibit\r\n\nthe  ability  of defendants  to  raise  a  defense  of  qualified\r\n\nimmunity  and benefit from the protections it offers.  Our ruling\r\n\ntoday in no way prevents a defendant from raising  the defense of\r\n\nqualified immunity at summary  judgment, regardless of whether it\r\n\nwas raised prior to discovery.\r\n\n          We, therefore, adopt the  position of the Sixth Circuit\r\n\nthat  the district court has  the discretion to  deny motions for\r\n\nsummary judgment that are not filed in an expeditious manner.\r\n\n            [T]he trial judge retains  discretion not\r\n            only to  set cut off dates  for discovery\r\n            but   to  cut  off  motions  for  summary\r\n            judgment, even those which  may challenge\r\n            the plaintiff's right to  go to trial  on\r\n            the  basis  of   absolute  or   qualified\r\n            immunity.   The quid pro quo  is obvious:\r\n            in exchange for the defendant's  right to\r\n            interrupt the judicial process, the court\r\n            may  expect  a   reasonable  modicum   of\r\n            diligence in the exercise of that right.\r\n\nKennedy, 797  F.2d at  301;   See also English,  23 F.3d  at 1090\r                                                        \r\n\n(\"[T]he  trial court  has  discretion  to  find  a  waiver  if  a\r\n\ndefendant  fails to assert the defense within the time limits set\r\n\nby the court or if the court otherwise finds that a defendant has\r\n\nfailed  to exercise due diligence or has asserted the defense for\r\n\ndilatory purposes.\").\r\n\n          We  add that  district courts  are encouraged  to enter\r\n\nscheduling  orders  to prevent  dilatory tactics  on the  part of\r\n\ndefendants  with qualified immunity defenses.  Absent an abuse of\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\ndiscretion, this court will enforce those scheduling deadlines by\r\n\naffirming a finding of waiver and awarding double costs.\r\n\n                 IV.  APPLICATION OF THE ANALYSIS\r                           IV.  APPLICATION OF THE ANALYSIS\r\n\n          In  the case before  us, defendants-appellants chose to\r\n\nraise the  defense  of qualified  immunity  only at  the  summary\r\n\njudgment stage.   As the  above discussion indicates,  failure to\r\n\nraise  the issue on the  pleadings does not  constitute waiver of\r\n\nthe right to  raise the  defense post-discovery.   Were this  the\r\n\nonly question before us, there would be no waiver.\r\n\n          In  the  instant case,  however, defendants  raised the\r\n\nqualified  immunity defense  very  late in  the pre-trial,  post-\r\n\ndiscovery phase, despite the fact that they had ample opportunity\r\n\nto  have   the  issue  resolved  expeditiously   earlier  in  the\r\n\nproceedings, rather  than generating  additional delay by  filing\r\n\nthis third motion for summary judgment.  The question before this\r\n\ncourt, therefore, is whether  the defendants waived the  right to\r\n\nraise the defense at this stage by failing to do so in a diligent\r                                         \r\n\nmanner  and by  failing to  offer an  explanation for  the delay.\r\n\nUpon  de novo  review,  we hold  that  the defense  of  qualified\r                       \r\n\nimmunity has been waived for the pre-trial stage.\r\n\n          We  note  first,  that because  the  qualified immunity\r\n\ndefense \"depends on the facts peculiarly within the knowledge and\r\n\ncontrol of the defendant[s],\"  G mez 446 U.S.  at 641, we see  no\r                                              \r\n\nreason why  defendants were unable  to raise the  defense earlier\r\n\nthan  they  did.    What  is  more,  they have  not  offered  any\r\n\nexplanation for their delay.\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\n          The   record  shows   that   defendants   had   several\r\n\nopportunities  to  raise  the qualified  immunity  defense  post-\r\n\ndiscovery.   First,  they  could have  filed  a summary  judgment\r\n\nmotion  between the completion of  discovery and the deadline for\r\n\ndispositive motions:  March 15 and March  30, 1993, respectively.\r\n\nDefendants  chose instead to await the outcome of their motion to\r\n\ndismiss (converted to  a motion  for summary  judgment) based  on\r\n\ntime bar and absolute immunity, for which they filed a Memorandum\r\n\nof  Law on  May 5,  1992.   Although the  failure to  include the\r\n\nqualified  immunity defense  in this  initial motion  for summary\r\n\njudgment  does  not,  by  itself, constitute  a  waiver  for  the\r\n\npurposes of  the  current  appeal,  it is  noteworthy  that,  had\r\n\ndefendants  included the  issue  in the  motion and  subsequently\r\n\nargued  all  three defenses  (time  bar,  absolute immunity,  and\r\n\nqualified immunity) on appeal, this Court would have resolved all\r\n\nthree issues in the course of a single appeal.\r\n\n          Second,  the parties  filed a  Joint Pretrial  Order on\r\n\nFebruary  2, 1993.  District  of Puerto Rico  Local Rule 314.3(E)\r\n\nrequires  each party  to  set forth  its  theory in  this  order.\r\n\nDefendants failed to mention qualified  immunity as part of their\r\n\nlegal theory.\r\n\n          Additionally, having  lost in their efforts  to dismiss\r\n\nthe  case  based on  time bar,  defendants  could have  filed for\r\n\nsummary  judgment  based   on  qualified   immunity.     Instead,\r\n\ndefendants waited almost four months until  November 1, 1994, six\r\n\ndays  before trial  was scheduled  to begin,  to file  an \"Urgent\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nMotion for Relief,\" seeking summary judgment on absolute immunity\r\n\ngrounds.  On  appeal, this  Court stated that  \"[w]e are left  to\r\n\nwonder why  absolute immunity was  originally pled as  a defense,\r\n\nabandoned  in  the initial  appeal,  and then  resurrected  as an\r\n\nemergency on  remand.\"  Guzm n II, 55 F.3d at 27.  Because \"[t]he\r                                           \r\n\ndistrict  court nevertheless  denied the  motion on  the merits,\"\r\n\nthis Court did not consider the absolute immunity defense waived.\r\n\nId.  This second  summary judgment motion gave the  defendants an\r             \r\n\nadditional  opportunity   to  raise  the  defense   of  qualified\r\n\nimmunity, but they chose instead to argue only absolute immunity.\r\n\n          On  November 4, 1994, the same day that the trial court\r\n\ndenied  the  motion  for   summary  judgment  based  on  absolute\r\n\nimmunity, defendants filed their  Answer to the Amended Complaint\r\n\nand a Notice of  Appeal.  The qualified immunity  defense appears\r\n\non the scene  for the first time in the  Answer.  Defendants have\r\n\noffered no explanation for  the failure to include  the qualified\r\n\nimmunity  defense in the  motion for summary  judgment filed only\r\n\nthree days  before the  Answer.   It was not  until almost  eight\r\n\nmonths later, on July 21, 1995, that defendants moved -- in their\r\n\nthird  such motion  -- for  summary judgment  based on  qualified\r\n\nimmunity.\r\n\n          As the record indicates, the piecemeal fashion in which\r\n\ndefendants  have brought  forward  their defense  is unduly  time\r\n\nconsuming  for  the courts  and  potentially  prejudicial to  the\r\n\nplaintiff.  Upon de novo review, we therefore find the defense of\r                                  \r\n\nqualified immunity to have  been waived for the current  stage of\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nthe  litigation:   the defense has  been available  to defendants\r\n\nsince  early  in  the  litigation  and,  as  the  district  court\r\n\ncorrectly  found,  the  plaintiff  has  been  prejudiced  by  the\r\n\ndefendants' intentional strategy of delay.\r\n\n          This decision does not imply, however, that the defense\r\n\nhas been waived for other stages of the litigation.   Because the\r\n\ndefense  of  qualified immunity  may  be raised  and  appealed at\r\n\nmultiple stages of the  trial, it would be inappropriate  to find\r\n\nwaiver for  all stages in the  current case.  We  need not decide\r\n\nwhether a sufficient showing of prejudice to the plaintiff  would\r\n\nresult in waiver for all stages: even assuming so arguendo, there\r                                                                    \r\n\nis no such showing in the instant case.  Our decision thus leaves\r\n\ndefendants  free to  present  the qualified  immunity defense  at\r\n\ntrial,  despite the fact that the defense is waived for pre-trial\r\n\npurposes.\r\n\n          We add that defendants' reliance on Valiente v. Rivera,\r                                                                          \r\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584184\"><a href=\"/opinion/584184/iris-violeta-valiente-v-hon-ramon-luis-rivera-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">966</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1992),  is misplaced.  In  that case, this\r\n\nCourt ruled that a motion  for summary judgment filed on  the eve\r\n\nof the originally  scheduled trial  date could not  be denied  as\r\n\nuntimely where a new trial date had been scheduled.  Instead, the\r\n\ntimeliness of  the motion had  to be viewed  in light of  the new\r\n\ndate.   Id. at 23.   In this  case, the problem  is not  that the\r                     \r\n\ndefense has filed  a motion on the  eve of trial.  Rather,  it is\r\n\nthat  defendants  have  pursued a  strategy  of  delay  which has\r\n\nprejudiced the plaintiff  and abused  the judicial  process.   We\r\n\nbelieve,  as we  have already  stated, that  some limits  must be\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nplaced  on  the  ability  of  defendants  to  use  their immunity\r\n\ndefenses to frustrate and delay the rights of plaintiffs.\r\n\n                          V.  CONCLUSION\r                                    V.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We affirm  the district  court's finding of  waiver and\r                       affirm\r                             \r\n\ndenial  of defendants' summary judgment motion.  In light of this\r\n\nfinding, we need not  reach the merits of the  qualified immunity\r\n\nclaim.   Considering the intentional delay imposed on the case by\r\n\ndefendants-appellants, we hereby  order defendants-appellants  to\r\n\npay double costs.\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n</pre>",
