Fire destroyed a building in\r                                           \r\n\nPonce, Puerto Rico, that likely would have been demolished at the\r\n\nowner's behest absent the fire.  The insurance company refused to\r\n\npay the policy amount, arguing that the owner lacked an insurable\r\n\ninterest  by virtue of  the almost certain  plans for demolition.\r\n\nThe  district court  rejected that  argument.   We affirm  on the\r\n\nbasis that the owner  had not abandoned the building  pursuant to\r\n\nan \"irrevocable commitment\" to demolish it.\r\n\n                                I.\r\n\n          Plaintiff The New  Ponce Shopping Center (\"New  Ponce\")\r\n\nis  a  partnership that  owns  several  commercial properties  in\r\n\nPonce, Puerto Rico.  In 1985, New Ponce purchased the Santa Mar a\r\n\nShopping Center, all of  which it renovated except for  La Bolera\r\n\nBuilding:    La Bolera  was under  a  lease contract  to Venancio\r\n\nSantos that would not expire until October 1992.  Although Santos\r\n\nattempted  to  renew  the  contract,  Aaron  Sokol,  New  Ponce's\r\n\nmanaging  partner,  refused  --  apparently   because  New  Ponce\r\n\nintended  to  construct  a  high  rise   residential  condominium\r\n\nbuilding on  the site.   There is  other evidence of  New Ponce's\r\n\nintent  to  demolish  La   Bolera  at  the  end  of   the  lease:\r\n\npreliminary permits had been sought and obtained from  the proper\r\n\ngovernment  agency  since  September  1992;  La  Bolera  obtained\r\n\nquotations  from  four  persons  to demolish  the  building;  and\r\n\nEngineer  Lombardo  P rez  was engaged  by  New  Ponce  to obtain\r\n\nadditional necessary permits.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n          After Santos'  lease ended  in October 1992,  La Bolera\r\n\nBuilding was not  put to  any purpose; rather,  the building  was\r\n\nbroken   into   several   times   and  became   a   hangout   for\r\n\n\"undesirables.\"    Wigberto  Morales,  General  Manager   of  the\r\n\nshopping center, testified that he  did not increase security  at\r\n\nthe building because he knew it was to be demolished.  On January\r\n\n15, 1993, P rez submitted documents for permission to demolish La\r\n\nBolera,  including   a  letter  signed  by   Sokol  stating  that\r\n\ndemolition was  urgent to avoid  vandalism and crime;  the letter\r\n\nalso mentioned  New Ponce's intent to  construct the condominium.\r\n\nFour days later on  January 19, La Bolera was destroyed  by fire.\r\n\nThere is no question that prior to the fire New Ponce intended to\r\n\nproceed with its plans to demolish the building.\r\n\n          La Bolera Building was  insured by Defendant  Integrand\r\n\nAssurance Company (\"Integrand\") for up to $699,750 against, among\r\n\nother things, loss by fire.  Integrand immediately hired Benjam n\r\n\nAcosta to investigate and  adjust the fire loss.   Acosta learned\r\n\nof  the demolition  plans through  meetings with  General Manager\r\n\nMorales  and  Engineer  P rez.    It  is  apparent  from Acosta's\r\n\nsubsequent  correspondence with  New Ponce  that he  believed New\r\n\nPonce could change its demolition plans.  In a letter to Morales,\r\n\nhe  stated that if \"you  decide to repair  and/or reconstruct the\r\n\naffected structure,  [Integrand] requires  that you  refrain from\r\n\ndemolishing or  removing any part  of the same  since [Integrand]\r\n\nwould  opt to order  that the affected  property be  put into the\r\n\nsame or better conditions than  it was at the time of  the fire.\"\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nThe letter continued:  \"If you decide to proceed with the already\r\n\nprojected  demolition . . . , [Integrand] will understand that it\r\n\nwill  be free  of responsibility  . .  . .\"   A  fax sent  to New\r\n\nPonce's  insurance broker is to like effect.  The fax also stated\r\n\nthat, should New  Ponce decide  to repair or  rebuild, it  should\r\n\nsend the  necessary plans and  specifications in order  to obtain\r\n\nconstruction permits.\r\n\n          Managing Partner  Sokol met with Acosta  on February 3,\r\n\n1993.  During that meeting, Sokol confirmed the demolition plans,\r\n\nbut said that  in light of the option exercised by Integrand, New\r\n\nPonce had decided to reconstruct La Bolera Building.  On February\r\n\n9,  Sokol sent the necessary plans  and specifications to Acosta.\r\n\nEngineer P rez and Integrand's  contractor discussed the scope of\r\n\nthe reconstruction and agreed on the work that needed to be done;\r\n\nthe  parties  exchanged   correspondence  regarding  La  Bolera's\r\n\nreconstruction.  Integrand's  contractor initially estimated  the\r\n\ncost at $1,265,766 if  the entire structure required replacement,\r\n\nplus $250,000  to bring the structure  up to code  and $55,000 in\r\n\nsalvage and  demolition expenses.    In a  revised estimate,  the\r\n\ncontractor said  he could reconstruct for  $350,000 plus $200,000\r\n\nfor  code compliance.  Acosta  then stated that  New Ponce should\r\n\npay  $283,790  of   the  cost:     $83,790  as   a  penalty   for\r\n\nunderinsurance and $200,000 for code compliance.\r\n\n          Sokol again  met with Acosta  and objected to  the cost\r\n\nfigures.  Unwavering, Acosta referred Sokol to Joaqu n Castrillo,\r\n\na  senior vice-president at Integrand.  Castrillo told Sokol that\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nIntegrand  never exercised an option to rebuild La Bolera and did\r\n\nnot intend  to do  so.   He instead  offered New Ponce  $200,000,\r\n\nwhich  Sokol immediately  rejected.   In  a subsequent  letter to\r\n\nSokol,  Castrillo said  that  Integrand  rejected  responsibility\r\n\nunder  the  insurance  policy  because  Sokol  misrepresented New\r\n\nPonce's plans to demolish La Bolera and withheld the existence of\r\n\na  contract  for   demolition  and  of   permits  for  a   future\r\n\ncondominium.\r\n\n          New Ponce filed suit in district court on May 25, 1993,\r\n\nseeking  compensation for  the fire  loss and  damages.   A bench\r\n\ntrial  was  held in  January and  March of  1995.   The presiding\r\n\nmagistrate  judge found in favor  of New Ponce,  and judgment was\r\n\nentered   against  Integrand   for  $594,787.50.     That  amount\r\n\nrepresents  80% of the amount  of the insurance  policy, less 15%\r\n\npursuant  to a vacancy clause in the policy.  Integrand argues on\r\n\nappeal that  it is not responsible  for the loss since  New Ponce\r\n\nwas  committed to  demolishing the  property  prior to  the fire.\r\n\nIntegrand also contests the amount of damages.\r\n\n                               II.\r\n\n          Both the district court and the parties fail to specify\r\n\nthe jurisdiction that supplies the applicable legal rules to this\r\n\ncase.   It is important to do  so because a federal court sitting\r\n\nin  diversity is not creating  general federal common  law.  Even\r\n\nwhere the  state or territory  has no controlling  authority, the\r\n\nfederal court's task  is limited to  predicting what the  highest\r\n\ncourt of that state  or territory would decide if  presented with\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nthe question.   Nieves v. University of Puerto  Rico, 7 F.3d 270,\r                                                              \r\n\n274-75  (1st Cir.  1993).   Generally, where  the parties  ignore\r\n\nchoice  of law issues on appeal, we indulge their assumption that\r\n\na particular jurisdiction's law  applies.  Evergreen Marine Corp.\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Six  Consignments of Frozen Scallops,  4 F.3d 90, 95  n.5 (1st\r                                                 \r\n\nCir. 1993).  But here nothing in the briefs or the record reveals\r\n\nany assumption other  than that  the district  court would  apply\r\n\nsome  general  law  of  insurance  unconnected  to  a  particular\r\n\njurisdiction.\r\n\n          Thus  our first  task is  to determine  the controlling\r\n\nlaw.   A federal court sitting in a diversity case must apply the\r\n\nchoice of  law rules of the  forum state.  Klaxon  Co. v. Stentor\r                                                                           \r\n\nElec.  Mfg.  Co., 313  U.S. 487,  496.   Puerto  Rico,  the forum\r                          \r\n\nterritory in this case, has approved the \"dominant or significant\r\n\ncontacts\" test for contract  and tort actions.  A.M.  Capen's Co.\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. American  Trading &amp; Prod.  Corp., 74  F.3d 317, 320  (1st Cir.\r                                             \r\n\n1996); In  re San Juan  DuPont Plaza Hotel  Fire Litig.,  45 F.3d\r                                                                 \r\n\n569,  576 (1st  Cir. 1995).   Under  that test,  the laws  of the\r\n\njurisdiction with  the most significant contacts  to the disputed\r\n\nissues will  apply.  74 F.3d  at 320.  We  have little difficulty\r\n\nconcluding  that a Puerto Rico court would apply Puerto Rico law:\r\n\nthe insured property is located in Puerto Rico, all of the events\r\n\nsurrounding the issues presented in this case  occurred in Puerto\r\n\nRico, including  all of  the meetings  between  the parties,  and\r\n\n(from what we can  discern in the record) the  insurance contract\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nwas  entered into  in Puerto Rico.   We  also have  not located a\r\n\nchoice-of-law provision in any of the record insurance policies.\r\n\n          Integrand's principal argument  is that  New Ponce  did\r\n\nnot have  an insurable interest in  La Bolera at the  time of the\r\n\nfire  because it planned to demolish the building and construct a\r\n\ncondominium in  its place.   We have not uncovered,  nor have the\r\n\nparties  cited to  us,  any applicable  Puerto  Rico law  on  the\r\n\nquestion of insurable interest  in a similar context.   Given the\r\n\nuniform  approach  taken in  the  few  reported cases  that  have\r\n\naddressed  the question,  we conclude that  the Supreme  Court of\r\n\nPuerto Rico would adopt the approach of those courts.\r\n\n          The  insured  must  have  an insurable  interest  in  a\r\n\nproperty before he  may recover damages under an insurance policy\r\n\nfor destruction of that property.   Chicago Title &amp; Trust Co.  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nUnited States Fidelity &amp;  Guar. Co., 511 F.2d 241,  246 (7th Cir.\r                                             \r\n\n1975).  The  insurable interest requirement  may at first  glance\r\n\nappear unfair to policyholders, because presumably a policyholder\r\n\nwould not  pay premiums to insure a property that has no economic\r\n\nvalue to  him.   But  the insurable  interest requirement  serves\r\n\nthree  policies that would not  be served by  merely deferring to\r\n\nthe  policyholder's decision to pay for  insurance.  Requiring an\r\n\ninsurable  interest  as  a   prerequisite  to  recovery  prevents\r\n\ngambling  through  insurance  polices,  prevents   rewarding  and\r\n\nthereby  tempting  the  destruction  of  property,  and  confines\r\n\ninsurance contracts to indemnity.  Id. at 247.\r                                                \r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\n          Several  courts have  applied  the  insurable  interest\r\n\nrequirement  in cases  where  a building  is  destroyed prior  to\r\n\ndemolition.   The leading  case is Garcy Corp.  v. Home Ins. Co.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n496  F.2d 479 (7th Cir.), cert. denied,  419 U.S. 843 (1974).  In\r                                                \r\n\nGarcy,  the owner of  a seven-story  building entered  a contract\r               \r\n\nwith a wrecking company for demolition of the building.  Although\r\n\nsurrounding structures had been removed, demolition had not begun\r\n\non the main building when it was destroyed by fire.  The question\r\n\npresented was  whether the owner  had an insurable  interest such\r\n\nthat he could recover under several fire insurance policies.  The\r\n\ncourt adopted the  standard that an insured  retains an insurable\r\n\ninterest  so long as the building has not been abandoned pursuant\r\n\nto  an \"irrevocable commitment\" to  demolition.  Id.  at 481; see\r                                                                           \r\n\nalso Gendron v. Pawtucket Mut.  Ins.

The court  found no irrevocable commitment to  demolition\r\n\nand  awarded  damages  to  the  owner  because  \"the  seven-story\r\n\nbuilding  was not in the  process of demolition\"  when it burned.\r                                           \r\n\n496 F.2d at 481 (emphasis in original).\r\n\n          A  review of  the cases decided  both before  and after\r\n\nGarcy   will  demonstrate   that  the   \"irrevocable  commitment\"\r               \r\n\nrequirement is not met in the  present case.  Mere evidence  that\r\n\nthe  insured contemplated demolition and  even took steps in that\r\n\ndirection prior to loss does not change his insurable interest in\r\n\nthe  property.  For example,  in American Ins.  Co. v. Treasurer,\r                                                                           \r\n\nSch. Dist.

When  the old  building  was\r\n\ndestroyed by  fire,  the  trial  judge  awarded  damages  to  the\r\n\ninsured.

The  court stated its  reluctance to  complicate\r\n\nlitigation  by allowing evidence  of an intent  to demolish where\r\n\ndemolition had not begun, but concluded:\r\n\n            [I]f the  settled policy of  the board of\r\n            education, that  it was legally  bound to\r\n            execute  and the performance  of which it\r\n            had  definitely entered upon, by the acts\r\n            of the  board itself, had  eliminated the\r\n            possible use of the  . . . building, they\r\n            should  not  be  indemnified against  its\r\n            loss  to  the  extent  of  being  paid by\r\n            insurer its actual going value.\r\n\nId. at  450.  The  board of education  had both signed  a binding\r             \r\n\ncontract  and  begun to  perform that  contract by  notifying the\r\n\nbuilder when it would surrender possession of the property.  Id.\r                                                                          \r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\n          In the  present case, there is ample  evidence that New\r\n\nPonce  intended to  demolish La  Bolera.   The company  had taken\r\n\nsubstantial  steps in that  direction prior to the  fire:  it had\r\n\nobtained preliminary permits from local authorities  and obtained\r\n\nquotations  for  demolition.    But  neither  these  actions  nor\r\n\nuncontested evidence  of New Ponce's actual intent to demolish La\r\n\nBolera  constitute an irrevocable commitment to do so.  La Bolera\r\n\nwas  certainly  not  in  the  process  of  demolition  when  fire\r\n\ndestroyed it,  and New Ponce had not  even entered into a binding\r\n\ncontract  for demolition.  Under the reasoning of the cases cited\r\n\nabove, New Ponce retained  an insurable interest in La  Bolera on\r\n\nJanuary  19, 1993,  when  it burned.    Thus the  district  court\r\n\nproperly awarded damages to New Ponce under the insurance policy.\r\n\n          Integrand  also  argues  that  the  amount  of  damages\r\n\nawarded  by the district court was not supported by the evidence.\r\n\nIntegrand  has  not  pointed  to  any  evidence  other  than  its\r\n\nassertion that New Ponce had no insurable interest to contest the\r\n\ncourt's award, and  we have already disposed  of that contention.\r\n\nAs the  district court  fully  explained, it  was presented  with\r\n\nnumerous  appraisals  as  high  as $1,265,700  for  the  cost  of\r\n\nrebuilding  and repairing La Bolera.   It reasonably decided that\r\n\nthe most objective figure, given the range of appraisals, was the\r\n\namount of  the  insurance policy,  $699,750,  which it  found  to\r\n\nrepresent 80% of the value of the building.  It then deducted 15%\r\n\npursuant to a vacancy  clause in the policy and  entered judgment\r\n\nfor  $594,787.50.   We find  no error  with the  district court's\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nassessment of damages and Integrand has failed to demonstrate  to\r\n\nthis Court that the award was not supported by the evidence.\r\n\n                               III.\r\n\n          Integrand's   remaining   arguments   do    not   merit\r\n\ndiscussion.   For  the foregoing  reasons,  the decision  of  the\r\n\ndistrict court is AFFIRMED.\r                                    \r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n",

The insurance company refused to pay the policy amount, arguing that the owner lacked an insurable interest by virtue of the almost certain plans for demolition.  The district court rejected that argument.  We affirm on the basis that the owner had not abandoned the building pursuant to an \"irrevocable commitment\" to demolish it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff The New Ponce Shopping Center (\"New Ponce\") is a partnership that owns several commercial properties in Ponce, Puerto Rico.  In 1985, New Ponce purchased the Santa Mara Shopping Center, all of which it renovated except for La Bolera Building:  La Bolera was under a lease contract to Venancio Santos that would not expire until October 1992.  Although Santos attempted to renew the contract, Aaron Sokol, New Ponce's managing partner, refused--apparently because New Ponce intended to construct a high rise residential condominium building on the site.  There is other evidence of New Ponce's intent to demolish La Bolera at the end of the lease:  preliminary permits had been sought and obtained from the proper government agency since September 1992;  La Bolera obtained quotations from four persons to demolish the building;  and Engineer Lombardo Perez was engaged by New Ponce to obtain additional necessary permits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Santos' lease ended in October 1992, La Bolera Building was not put to any purpose;  rather, the building was broken into several times and became a hangout for \"undesirables.\"   Wigberto Morales, General Manager of the shopping center, testified that he did not increase security at the building because he knew it was to be demolished.  On January 15, 1993, Perez submitted documents for permission to demolish La Bolera, including a letter signed by Sokol stating that demolition was urgent to avoid vandalism and crime;  the letter also mentioned New Ponce's intent to construct the condominium.  Four days later on January 19, La Bolera was destroyed by fire.  There is no question that prior to the fire New Ponce intended to proceed with its plans to demolish the building.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">La Bolera Building was insured by Defendant Integrand Assurance Company (\"Integrand\") for up to $699,750 against, among other things, loss by fire.  Integrand immediately hired Benjamn Acosta to investigate and adjust the fire loss.  Acosta learned of the demolition plans through meetings with General Manager Morales and Engineer Perez.  It is apparent from Acosta's subsequent correspondence with New Ponce that he believed New Ponce could change its demolition plans.  In a letter to Morales, he stated that if \"you decide to repair and/or reconstruct the affected structure, [Integrand] requires that you refrain from demolishing or removing any part of the same since [Integrand] would opt to order that the affected property be put into the same or better conditions than it was at the time of the fire.\"   The letter continued:  \"If you decide to proceed with the already projected demolition ..., [Integrand] will understand that it will be free of responsibility....\"  A fax sent to New Ponce's insurance broker is to like effect.  The fax also stated that, should New Ponce decide to repair or rebuild, it should send the necessary plans and specifications in order to obtain construction permits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Managing Partner Sokol met with Acosta on February 3, 1993.  During that meeting, Sokol confirmed the demolition plans, but said that in light of the option exercised by Integrand, New Ponce had decided to reconstruct La Bolera Building.  On February 9, Sokol sent the necessary plans and specifications to Acosta.  Engineer Perez and Integrand's contractor discussed the scope of the reconstruction and agreed on the work that needed to be done;  the parties exchanged correspondence regarding La Bolera's reconstruction.  Integrand's contractor initially estimated the cost at $1,265,766 if the entire structure required replacement, plus $250,000 to bring the structure up to code and $55,000 in salvage and demolition expenses.  In a revised estimate, the contractor said he could reconstruct for $350,000 plus $200,000 for code compliance.  Acosta then stated that New Ponce should pay $283,790 of the cost:  $83,790 as a penalty for underinsurance and $200,000 for code compliance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sokol again met with Acosta and objected to the cost figures.  Unwavering, Acosta referred Sokol to Joaqun Castrillo, a senior vice-president at Integrand.  Castrillo told Sokol that Integrand never exercised an option to rebuild La Bolera and did not intend to do so.  He instead offered New Ponce $200,000, which Sokol immediately rejected.  In a subsequent letter to Sokol, Castrillo said that Integrand rejected responsibility under the insurance policy because Sokol misrepresented New Ponce's plans to demolish La Bolera and withheld the existence of a contract for demolition and of permits for a future condominium.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">New Ponce filed suit in district court on May 25, 1993, seeking compensation for the fire loss and damages.  A bench trial was held in January and March of 1995.  The presiding magistrate judge found in favor of New Ponce, and judgment was entered against Integrand for $594,787.50.  That amount represents 80% of the amount of the insurance policy, less 15% pursuant to a vacancy clause in the policy.  Integrand argues on appeal that it is not responsible for the loss since New Ponce was committed to demolishing the property prior to the fire.  Integrand also contests the amount of damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both the district court and the parties fail to specify the jurisdiction that supplies the applicable legal rules to this case.  It is important to do so because a federal court sitting in diversity is not creating general federal common law.  Even where the state or territory has no controlling authority, the federal court's task is limited to predicting what the highest court of that state or territory would decide if presented with the question.  Nieves v. University of Puerto Rico, 7 F.3d 270, 274-75 (1st Cir.1993).  Generally, where the parties ignore choice of law issues on appeal, we indulge their assumption that a particular jurisdiction's law applies.  Evergreen Marine Corp. v. Six Consignments of Frozen Scallops, 4 F.3d 90, 95 n. 5 (1st Cir.1993).  But here nothing in the briefs or the record reveals any assumption other than that the district court would apply some general law of insurance unconnected to a particular jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus our first task is to determine the controlling law.  A federal court sitting in a diversity case must apply the choice of law rules of the forum state.  Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487, 496, 61 S.Ct. 1020, 1021-22, 85 L.Ed. 1477.   Puerto Rico, the forum territory in this case, has approved the \"dominant or significant contacts\" test for contract and tort actions.  A.M. Capen's Co. v. American Trading &amp; Prod.  Corp., 74 F.3d 317, 320 (1st Cir.1996);  In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., 45 F.3d 569, 576 (1st Cir.1995).  Under that test, the laws of the jurisdiction with the most significant contacts to the disputed issues will apply.  74 F.3d at 320.   We have little difficulty concluding that a Puerto Rico court would apply Puerto Rico law:  the insured property is located in Puerto Rico, all of the events surrounding the issues presented in this case occurred in Puerto Rico, including all of the meetings between the parties, and (from what we can discern in the record) the insurance contract was entered into in Puerto Rico.  We also have not located a choice-of-law provision in any of the record insurance policies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Integrand's principal argument is that New Ponce did not have an insurable interest in La Bolera at the time of the fire because it planned to demolish the building and construct a condominium in its place.  We have not uncovered, nor have the parties cited to us, any applicable Puerto Rico law on the question of insurable interest in a similar context.  Given the uniform approach taken in the few reported cases that have addressed the question, we conclude that the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico would adopt the approach of those courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The insured must have an insurable interest in a property before he may recover damages under an insurance policy for destruction of that property.  Chicago Title &amp; Trust Co. v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., 511 F.2d 241, 246 (7th Cir.1975).  The insurable interest requirement may at first glance appear unfair to policyholders, because presumably a policyholder would not pay premiums to insure a property that has no economic value to him.  But the insurable interest requirement serves three policies that would not be served by merely deferring to the policyholder's decision to pay for insurance.  Requiring an insurable interest as a prerequisite to recovery prevents gambling through insurance polices, prevents rewarding and thereby tempting the destruction of property, and confines insurance contracts to indemnity.  Id. at 247.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several courts have applied the insurable interest requirement in cases where a building is destroyed prior to demolition.  The leading case is Garcy Corp. v. Home Ins. Co., 496 F.2d 479 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 843, 95 S.Ct. 75, 42 L.Ed.2d 71 (1974).  In Garcy, the owner of a seven-story building entered a contract with a wrecking company for demolition of the building.  Although surrounding structures had been removed, demolition had not begun on the main building when it was destroyed by fire.  The question presented was whether the owner had an insurable interest such that he could recover under several fire insurance policies.  The court adopted the standard that an insured retains an insurable interest so long as the building has not been abandoned pursuant to an \"irrevocable commitment\" to demolition.  Id. at 481;  see also Gendron v. Pawtucket Mut. Ins. Co., 384 A.2d 694, 697 (Me.1978).  The court found no irrevocable commitment to demolition and awarded damages to the owner because \"the seven-story building was not in the process of demolition\" when it burned.  496 F.2d at 481 (emphasis in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A review of the cases decided both before and after Garcy will demonstrate that the \"irrevocable commitment\" requirement is not met in the present case.  Mere evidence that the insured contemplated demolition and even took steps in that direction prior to loss does not change his insurable interest in the property.  For example, in American Ins. Co. v. Treasurer, Sch. Dist. No. 37, 273 F.2d 757 (10th Cir.1959) (Oklahoma law), prior to partial destruction by a tornado of a school building, the insured had received bids for demolition and had in fact begun construction on a replacement building.  Nonetheless, the court found for the insured, refusing to rely on \"unascertained and speculative future events.\"  Id. at 759.   In Knuppel v. American Ins. Co., 269 F.2d 163 (7th Cir.1959) (Illinois law), the court held that plaintiff's apparent decision to have the building, which was later destroyed by fire, demolished did not affect his insurable interest where there was testimony that he was undecided at the time of the fire whether to demolish;  the court so held even though plaintiff had obtained a proposal from a contractor who offered to demolish the building.

This is so because \"it cannot be stated with certainty that [the demolition] would, in fact, be commenced....  Performance of the contract may have been delayed by a number of other factors....

Even where the insured is under a legal duty to demolish a building, courts have found an insurable interest.  In Bailey v. Gulf Ins.

For example, in Royal Ins. Co. v. Sisters of Presentation, 430 F.2d 759 (9th Cir.1970) (California law), the owners of an old convent building moved into a new building subsequent to signing contracts that included demolition of the old building.  When the old building was destroyed by fire, the trial judge awarded damages to the insured.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that there was no insurable interest since the contracts were all specifically enforceable:  in no event would the owners have had a right to reinhabit the old building.  Id. at 761-62.   The existence of an enforceable contract for demolition was held to eliminate the insurable interest in a property destroyed by fire in Board of Educ. of Hancock County v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., 124 W.Va. 163, 19 S.E.2d 448 (1942).  The court stated its reluctance to complicate litigation by allowing evidence of an intent to demolish where demolition had not begun, but concluded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>[I]f the settled policy of the board of education, that it was legally bound to execute and the performance of which it had definitely entered upon, by the acts of the board itself, had eliminated the possible use of the ... building, they should not be indemnified against its loss to the extent of being paid by insurer its actual going value.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id., 19 S.E.2d at 450.   The board of education had both signed a binding contract and begun to perform that contract by notifying the builder when it would surrender possession of the property.

The company had taken substantial steps in that direction prior to the fire:  it had obtained preliminary permits from local authorities and obtained quotations for demolition.  But neither these actions nor uncontested evidence of New Ponce's actual intent to demolish La Bolera constitute an irrevocable commitment to do so.  La Bolera was certainly not in the process of demolition when fire destroyed it, and New Ponce had not even entered into a binding contract for demolition.  Under the reasoning of the cases cited above, New Ponce retained an insurable interest in La Bolera on January 19, 1993, when it burned.  Thus the district court properly awarded damages to New Ponce under the insurance policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Integrand also argues that the amount of damages awarded by the district court was not supported by the evidence.  Integrand has not pointed to any evidence other than its assertion that New Ponce had no insurable interest to contest the court's award, and we have already disposed of that contention.  As the district court fully explained, it was presented with numerous appraisals as high as $1,265,700 for the cost of rebuilding and repairing La Bolera.  It reasonably decided that the most objective figure, given the range of appraisals, was the amount of the insurance policy, $699,750, which it found to represent 80% of the value of the building.  It then deducted 15% pursuant to a vacancy clause in the policy and entered judgment for $594,787.50.  We find no error with the district court's assessment of damages and Integrand has failed to demonstrate to this Court that the award was not supported by the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Integrand's remaining arguments do not merit discussion.

The insurance company refused to pay the policy amount, arguing that the owner lacked an insurable interest by virtue of the almost certain plans for demolition.  The district court rejected that argument.  We affirm on the basis that the owner had not abandoned the building pursuant to an \"irrevocable commitment\" to demolish it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff The New Ponce Shopping Center (\"New Ponce\") is a partnership that owns several commercial properties in Ponce, Puerto Rico.  In 1985, New Ponce purchased the Santa Mara Shopping Center, all of which it renovated except for La Bolera Building:  La Bolera was under a lease contract to Venancio Santos that would not expire until October 1992.  Although Santos attempted to renew the contract, Aaron Sokol, New Ponce's managing partner, refused--apparently because New Ponce intended to construct a high rise residential condominium building on the site.  There is other evidence of New Ponce's intent to demolish La Bolera at the end of the lease:  preliminary permits had been sought and obtained from the proper government agency since September 1992;  La Bolera obtained quotations from four persons to demolish the building;  and Engineer Lombardo Perez was engaged by New Ponce to obtain additional necessary permits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Santos' lease ended in October 1992, La Bolera Building was not put to any purpose;  rather, the building was broken into several times and became a hangout for \"undesirables.\"   Wigberto Morales, General Manager of the shopping center, testified that he did not increase security at the building because he knew it was to be demolished.  On January 15, 1993, Perez submitted documents for permission to demolish La Bolera, including a letter signed by Sokol stating that demolition was urgent to avoid vandalism and crime;  the letter also mentioned New Ponce's intent to construct the condominium.  Four days later on January 19, La Bolera was destroyed by fire.  There is no question that prior to the fire New Ponce intended to proceed with its plans to demolish the building.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">La Bolera Building was insured by Defendant Integrand Assurance Company (\"Integrand\") for up to $699,750 against, among other things, loss by fire.  Integrand immediately hired Benjamn Acosta to investigate and adjust the fire loss.  Acosta learned of the demolition plans through meetings with General Manager Morales and Engineer Perez.  It is apparent from Acosta's subsequent correspondence with New Ponce that he believed New Ponce could change its demolition plans.  In a letter to Morales, he stated that if \"you decide to repair and/or reconstruct the affected structure, [Integrand] requires that you refrain from demolishing or removing any part of the same since [Integrand] would opt to order that the affected property be put into the same or better conditions than it was at the time of the fire.\"   The letter continued:  \"If you decide to proceed with the already projected demolition ..., [Integrand] will understand that it will be free of responsibility....\"  A fax sent to New Ponce's insurance broker is to like effect.  The fax also stated that, should New Ponce decide to repair or rebuild, it should send the necessary plans and specifications in order to obtain construction permits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Managing Partner Sokol met with Acosta on February 3, 1993.  During that meeting, Sokol confirmed the demolition plans, but said that in light of the option exercised by Integrand, New Ponce had decided to reconstruct La Bolera Building.  On February 9, Sokol sent the necessary plans and specifications to Acosta.  Engineer Perez and Integrand's contractor discussed the scope of the reconstruction and agreed on the work that needed to be done;  the parties exchanged correspondence regarding La Bolera's reconstruction.  Integrand's contractor initially estimated the cost at $1,265,766 if the entire structure required replacement, plus $250,000 to bring the structure up to code and $55,000 in salvage and demolition expenses.  In a revised estimate, the contractor said he could reconstruct for $350,000 plus $200,000 for code compliance.  Acosta then stated that New Ponce should pay $283,790 of the cost:  $83,790 as a penalty for underinsurance and $200,000 for code compliance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sokol again met with Acosta and objected to the cost figures.  Unwavering, Acosta referred Sokol to Joaqun Castrillo, a senior vice-president at Integrand.  Castrillo told Sokol that Integrand never exercised an option to rebuild La Bolera and did not intend to do so.  He instead offered New Ponce $200,000, which Sokol immediately rejected.  In a subsequent letter to Sokol, Castrillo said that Integrand rejected responsibility under the insurance policy because Sokol misrepresented New Ponce's plans to demolish La Bolera and withheld the existence of a contract for demolition and of permits for a future condominium.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">New Ponce filed suit in district court on May 25, 1993, seeking compensation for the fire loss and damages.  A bench trial was held in January and March of 1995.  The presiding magistrate judge found in favor of New Ponce, and judgment was entered against Integrand for $594,787.50.  That amount represents 80% of the amount of the insurance policy, less 15% pursuant to a vacancy clause in the policy.  Integrand argues on appeal that it is not responsible for the loss since New Ponce was committed to demolishing the property prior to the fire.  Integrand also contests the amount of damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both the district court and the parties fail to specify the jurisdiction that supplies the applicable legal rules to this case.  It is important to do so because a federal court sitting in diversity is not creating general federal common law.  Even where the state or territory has no controlling authority, the federal court's task is limited to predicting what the highest court of that state or territory would decide if presented with the question.

Under that test, the laws of the jurisdiction with the most significant contacts to the disputed issues will apply.  74 F.3d at 320.   We have little difficulty concluding that a Puerto Rico court would apply Puerto Rico law:  the insured property is located in Puerto Rico, all of the events surrounding the issues presented in this case occurred in Puerto Rico, including all of the meetings between the parties, and (from what we can discern in the record) the insurance contract was entered into in Puerto Rico.  We also have not located a choice-of-law provision in any of the record insurance policies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Integrand's principal argument is that New Ponce did not have an insurable interest in La Bolera at the time of the fire because it planned to demolish the building and construct a condominium in its place.  We have not uncovered, nor have the parties cited to us, any applicable Puerto Rico law on the question of insurable interest in a similar context.  Given the uniform approach taken in the few reported cases that have addressed the question, we conclude that the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico would adopt the approach of those courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The insured must have an insurable interest in a property before he may recover damages under an insurance policy for destruction of that property.

The insurable interest requirement may at first glance appear unfair to policyholders, because presumably a policyholder would not pay premiums to insure a property that has no economic value to him.  But the insurable interest requirement serves three policies that would not be served by merely deferring to the policyholder's decision to pay for insurance.  Requiring an insurable interest as a prerequisite to recovery prevents gambling through insurance polices, prevents rewarding and thereby tempting the destruction of property, and confines insurance contracts to indemnity.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></span> (1974).  In Garcy, the owner of a seven-story building entered a contract with a wrecking company for demolition of the building.  Although surrounding structures had been removed, demolition had not begun on the main building when it was destroyed by fire.  The question presented was whether the owner had an insurable interest such that he could recover under several fire insurance policies.  The court adopted the standard that an insured retains an insurable interest so long as the building has not been abandoned pursuant to an \"irrevocable commitment\" to demolition.  Id. at 481;  see also Gendron v. Pawtucket Mut. Ins.

The court found no irrevocable commitment to demolition and awarded damages to the owner because \"the seven-story building was not in the process of demolition\" when it burned.  496 F.2d at 481 (emphasis in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A review of the cases decided both before and after Garcy will demonstrate that the \"irrevocable commitment\" requirement is not met in the present case.  Mere evidence that the insured contemplated demolition and even took steps in that direction prior to loss does not change his insurable interest in the property.  For example, in American Ins.

Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"283182\"><a href=\"/opinion/283182/robert-l-bailey-v-gulf-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span> (10th Cir.1969) (Oklahoma law), the building in question had been declared a nuisance by the city and ordered demolished, but the court nonetheless concluded that the insurance company was not shielded from liability.  Id. at 48-49 (citing additional authority).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where courts have found no insurable interest, the facts revealed a stronger commitment to demolition than present here.  In Woodruff v. Southeastern Fire Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"290204\"><a href=\"/opinion/290204/dr-gerald-g-woodruff-jr-v-southeastern-fire-insurance-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span> (5th Cir.1970) (Alabama law), the insured property burned during the process of demolition.  The court held that there was no insurable interest where the facts revealed a \"complete and permanent abandonment of any use of the structure of the building.\"  Id. at 562.   To the same effect are Lieberman v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., 6 Ill.App.3d 948, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2124657\"><a href=\"/opinion/2124657/lieberman-v-hartford-fire-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">287</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span> (1972), in which the insured had not only signed contracts for demolition, but demolition had begun three days prior to the fire, and Deni v. General Accident Ins. Co. of Am., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.D.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">605</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">572</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.S.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></span>, appeal denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">751</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">580</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.S.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">198</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">588</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></span> (1991), in which demolition had also commenced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even the most permissive cases require that the insured has entered a binding contract under circumstances making escape from the contract difficult or unlikely.  For example, in Royal Ins. Co. v. Sisters of Presentation, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"291671\"><a href=\"/opinion/291671/royal-insurance-company-limited-a-foreign-corporation-v-the-sisters-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">759</span></a></span> (9th Cir.1970) (California law), the owners of an old convent building moved into a new building subsequent to signing contracts that included demolition of the old building.  When the old building was destroyed by fire, the trial judge awarded damages to the insured.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that there was no insurable interest since the contracts were all specifically enforceable:  in no event would the owners have had a right to reinhabit the old building.  Id. at 761-62.   The existence of an enforceable contract for demolition was held to eliminate the insurable interest in a property destroyed by fire in Board of Educ. of Hancock County v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., 124 W.Va. 163, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4003908\"><a href=\"/opinion/4227379/bd-of-education-of-v-insurance-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">448</span></a></span> (1942).  The court stated its reluctance to complicate litigation by allowing evidence of an intent to demolish where demolition had not begun, but concluded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>[I]f the settled policy of the board of education, that it was legally bound to execute and the performance of which it had definitely entered upon, by the acts of the board itself, had eliminated the possible use of the ... building, they should not be indemnified against its loss to the extent of being paid by insurer its actual going value.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id., 19 S.E.2d at 450.   The board of education had both signed a binding contract and begun to perform that contract by notifying the builder when it would surrender possession of the property.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present case, there is ample evidence that New Ponce intended to demolish La Bolera.  The company had taken substantial steps in that direction prior to the fire:  it had obtained preliminary permits from local authorities and obtained quotations for demolition.  But neither these actions nor uncontested evidence of New Ponce's actual intent to demolish La Bolera constitute an irrevocable commitment to do so.  La Bolera was certainly not in the process of demolition when fire destroyed it, and New Ponce had not even entered into a binding contract for demolition.  Under the reasoning of the cases cited above, New Ponce retained an insurable interest in La Bolera on January 19, 1993, when it burned.  Thus the district court properly awarded damages to New Ponce under the insurance policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Integrand also argues that the amount of damages awarded by the district court was not supported by the evidence.  Integrand has not pointed to any evidence other than its assertion that New Ponce had no insurable interest to contest the court's award, and we have already disposed of that contention.  As the district court fully explained, it was presented with numerous appraisals as high as $1,265,700 for the cost of rebuilding and repairing La Bolera.  It reasonably decided that the most objective figure, given the range of appraisals, was the amount of the insurance policy, $699,750, which it found to represent 80% of the value of the building.  It then deducted 15% pursuant to a vacancy clause in the policy and entered judgment for $594,787.50.  We find no error with the district court's assessment of damages and Integrand has failed to demonstrate to this Court that the award was not supported by the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Integrand's remaining arguments do not merit discussion.  For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
