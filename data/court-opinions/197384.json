See United  States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nStaula, 80 F.3d 596, 599 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 156\r                                                           \r\n\n(1996).  On  that basis, the jury could  have found the following\r\n\nfacts.\r\n\n          In the spring of 1993, the FBI began a money laundering\r\n\ninvestigation.  An undercover FBI agent, Agent Mart n Su rez, and\r\n\nan  informant infiltrated  a money  laundering organization  that\r\n\nworked under  the direction of  a man known as  \"Honcho.\"  Honcho\r\n\ncommunicated to Agent Su rez and the informant that they would be\r\n\ncontacted through their pager, by a person using the code \"Romero\r\n\n55.\"    On May 24, 1994, Agent Su rez received a page from Romero\r\n\n55 and contacted  him by phone.  Agent Su rez, the informant, and\r\n\nRomero 55   -- who  was later identified  as Julio  Robles-Torres\r\n\n(\"Robles\") -- arranged to  meet the following day, at  which time\r\n\nRomero 55  delivered approximately  $600,000 to Agent  Su rez and\r\n\nthe informant.  The  conversation that took place at  the meeting\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nwas  recorded,  although there  were  periods  when the  recorder\r\n\nmalfunctioned.\r\n\n          At  trial,  the court  admitted the  taped conversation\r\n\ninto  evidence  over the  objection  of defense  counsel.   Agent\r\n\nSu rez testified that during the interrupted portion of the tape,\r\n\nRobles indicated that he  had started an individual named  \"Papo\"\r\n\nin  \"this business\" and that  Papo had made  six million dollars.\r\n\nAgent  Su rez testified that, in the context of the conversation,\r\n\nhe  interpreted \"this business\" to  mean the drug  business.  The\r\n\nexchange  between Agent  Su rez  and government  counsel went  as\r\n\nfollows:\r\n\n            Agent  Su rez:    I  recall  that  he had\r\n            mentioned that  he  had started  Papo  in\r\n            this  business.  He had -- also mentioned\r\n            that Papo was in the car repair business.\r\n\n            Government:  Okay.  When  you say that he\r\n            started --  he, Robles, had  started Papo\r\n            in that  business,  what business  is  he\r\n            talking about?\r\n\n            Agent Su rez:  In the drug business.\r\n\nTr. 2 at 278.\r\n\n          During the taped conversation, Robles also stated  that\r\n\nhe had  given a lottery  ticket in  the amount of  $250,000 to  a\r\n\nfriend of Papo.   Agent Su rez testified that drug  smugglers buy\r\n\nwinning lottery tickets in order to launder  money.  There was no\r\n\nmention  of  Montalvo  or  Gonz lez-Maldonado  during  the  taped\r\n\nconversation.\r\n\n          Based on the delivery  of $600,000 and the conversation\r\n\nbetween  Agent Su rez and Robles, the government obtained a court\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\norder authorizing  the interception of communications  on Robles'\r\n\ncellular phone.   At trial,  the government introduced  more than\r\n\nsixty  of these intercepted calls.  The government states that in\r\n\nfifteen of those calls,  appellant Montalvo, identified as \"Ito,\"\r\n\nspoke  with   Robles;  and  in   ten  calls,  Gonz lez-Maldonado,\r\n\nidentified as \"Nori,\" spoke with Robles.\r\n\n          On  June 27,  1994, FBI  Special Agent  Daniel Gonz lez\r\n\nintercepted  a conversation between Robles and Papo.  During that\r\n\nconversation,  Robles  and Papo  referred  to  \"tickets.\"   Agent\r\n\nGonz lez,  over  objection,  testified  that  the  word  \"ticket\"\r\n\nreferred  to money.   Neither  appellant participated  in or  was\r\n\nmentioned during the call.\r\n\n          On June 28, 1994, six conversations were intercepted by\r\n\npolice.   The jury  could have concluded  that appellant Montalvo\r\n\nparticipated  in one  of  these calls.    The first  call  was to\r\n\nappellant   Gonz lez-Maldonado   at  his   store,   Mazda  Fever.\r\n\nGonz lez-Maldonado indicated that he had four tickets, and Robles\r\n\nsaid that they could combine their tickets.\r\n\n          Based  on  these  calls,  another  FBI  Special  Agent,\r\n\nMichael Plichta, set up surveillance at Mazda Fever.  He observed\r\n\nRobles arrive in a gray Volvo  around 4:00 p.m., on June 28, meet\r\n\nbriefly with an  unidentified male, and  then drive around  back,\r\n\nwhere  he remained, out  of sight, for  twenty minutes.   At 4:20\r\n\np.m., an individual identified only as \"Chepe\" called Robles, who\r\n\nstated that he was picking up the tickets at that moment and that\r\n\nhe would proceed to  deliver them.  When Robles  departed, he was\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nfollowed to a Ponderosa restaurant, where he met briefly with two\r\n\nmen.   Shortly thereafter, the two men were detained and $715,309\r\n\nwas  seized from a  suitcase and a  cardboard box  found in their\r\n\ncar.      The following day, Papo  and Robles had three telephone\r\n\nconversations about  the seizure,  including the question  of who\r\n\nwould assume responsibility for the lost money.\r\n\n          In  recorded conversations  on  July  8,  1994,  Robles\r\n\nconfirmed with Montalvo and an individual identified as \"Gurucho\"\r\n\nthat Gonz lez-Maldonado had all the tickets.  In his conversation\r\n\nwith  Gurucho,  Robles  indicated  that  Gurucho  should  contact\r\n\nGonz lez-Maldonado  about a delivery.   Gonz lez  informed Robles\r\n\nthat  Gurucho  had  directed  them  to  make  a  delivery  to  an\r\n\nindividual identified as \"Nina\" at the Condado Plaza Hotel.\r\n\n          On July  9, 1994,  the FBI established  surveillance at\r\n\nthe  Condado  Plaza  Hotel.    FBI  Special  Agent  Jane  Peltier\r\n\ntestified  that  Robles  went to  Mazda  Fever  around 8:30  a.m.\r\n\nShortly after, he left  Mazda Fever and proceeded to  the Condado\r\n\nPlaza Hotel parking garage, arriving around 9:00 a.m.  Carrying a\r\n\ngray bag,  he went to the  eighth floor, and then  left the hotel\r\n\nempty-handed.  FBI agents entered room 825 and recovered the gray\r\n\nbag and seized $243,600 from the safe in the room.\r\n\n          At the time of  Montalvo's arrest, police seized, among\r\n\nother things, a  photocopy of  a Puerto Rico  lottery check,  two\r\n\npagers, and two notebooks.  In addition to Montalvo and Gonz lez-\r\n\nMaldonado,  the police  arrested Robles.   The  three were  to be\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\ntried together until, in March 1995, Robles was found incompetent\r\n\nto stand trial and the case against him was severed.\r\n\n          Appellants assert  several claims  on appeal.   We find\r\n\nsome  of   those  claims   valid,  warranting  reversal   of  the\r\n\nconvictions.   In order to give  as much guidance as  possible to\r\n\nthe district court, we also discuss some of the other claims that\r\n\nare likely to resurface if there is a new trial.\r\n\n         I.  The Psychiatric Testimony of Dr. Jos  Fumero\r                   I.  The Psychiatric Testimony of Dr. Jos  Fumero\r\n\n          Appellants  argue  that  the district  court  erred  in\r\n\nexcluding the testimony of Dr. Fumero, the psychiatrist who  had,\r\n\nat   the  court's  direction,   initially  examined   Robles  for\r\n\ncompetency.  This claim includes two distinct arguments.   First,\r\n\nappellants  claim that the court  erred in excluding Dr. Fumero's\r\n\ntestimony after defense counsel had  relied on an earlier  ruling\r\n\nthat the testimony would  be allowed.  Second, appellants  assert\r\n\nthat the court's decision to exclude Fumero's testimony was based\r\n\non the mistaken  belief that  the testimony was  offered only  to\r\n\naddress the issue of Robles' competency as a witness.  Appellants\r\n\ncontend that the testimony was actually offered to:\r\n\n            provide  information  concerning  Robles'\r\n            medical   history   and   his   diagnosed\r\n            schizophrenia,    and     the    possible\r\n            ramifications  of   Robles'  illness  for\r\n            evaluation   of   the   evidence  to   be\r\n            introduced   at   trial  --   to  provide\r\n            information  relevant  to  whether, as  a\r\n            result  of his  mental disease  or defect\r\n            Robles  was  unable  to   appreciate  the\r\n            nature and quality or wrongfulness of his\r\n            acts  in  May-June,   1994;  or   whether\r\n            aspects of  his illness were  relevant to\r\n            assessing the reliability and  meaning of\r\n            Robles' statements.\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nBrief  of Appellant Montalvo, at 17.   We deal with each claim in\r\n\nturn.\r\n\n          A.  Opening Statements\r                    A.  Opening Statements\r\n\n          Prior to  trial, defense  counsel met with  Dr. Fumero,\r\n\nwho had conducted the competency  examination of Robles.   Fumero\r\n\nopined that Robles was suffering froma mental illness at the time\r\n\nof  the  offenses  and that  his  mental  illness  resulted in  a\r\n\ntendency  to exaggerate.  Defense counsel informed the court that\r\n\nhe  intended  to  have  Fumero testify  at  trial,  arguing  that\r\n\nFumero's testimony  should be  admitted  so that  the jury  could\r\n\ndetermine the weight to be given to the taped conversations.  Tr.\r\n\n1 at 7.  The court stated  that it would \"let Dr. Fumero  testify\r\n\nand then let that go to the jury.\"1  Tr. 1 at 21.\r\n\n          During opening statements, counsel for  both defendants\r\n\nmade reference  to Robles' mental  state.  Counsel  for Gonz lez-\r\n\nMaldonado promised the jury that he  would produce a psychiatrist\r\n\nwho   would  testify   that   a  person   in  Robles'   condition\r\n\n\"exaggerates,  and  that  everything   that  he  talks  about  is\r\n\ngreater.\"   Tr. 1 at 163.   Counsel for Montalvo,  in his opening\r\n\nstatement, stated:\r\n\n            The  expert  selected   by  this   Court,\r\n            Dr. Fumero, selected by this  Court, will\r\n            come   here,  will  sit  there  and  will\r\n            testify that during this conspiracy . . .\r\n            Mr. Julio   Robles-Torres  was   mentally\r\n            insane.  Therefore, you cannot trust him.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  Following opening statements, the court reiterated  its intent\r\nto allow Dr. Fumero to testify.  \"I said I would allow Dr. Fumero\r\nto testify at trial.\"  Tr. 1 at 189.\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\n            You  cannot  put much  attention  to what\r\n            he's saying because he exaggerates.\r\n\nTr. 1 at 169.\r\n\n          During the  presentation of defendants' case, the court\r\n\nreconsidered  its earlier  decision and  decided that  Dr. Fumero\r\n\nwould  not be allowed to testify because the testimony would only\r\n\ngo to  the issue of Robles'  competency as a witness,  which is a\r\n\nquestion for the court, and that evidence of a mental defect does\r\n\nnot render testimony inadmissible.  See Tr. 8 at 1506.\r                                                 \r\n\n          Appellants  argue that  even if Fumero's  testimony was\r\n\nproperly excluded, the court  committed reversible error by first\r\n\nruling that it would permit Fumero to testify and then, after the\r\n\nclose of the  government's case, ruling that his  testimony would\r\n\nbe excluded.\r\n\n          In  Anderson v.  Butler, 858 F.2d  16 (1st  Cir. 1988),\r                                           \r\n\ndefense counsel, in his opening, told the jury that he would call\r\n\na  psychiatrist and a psychologist to show that the defendant had\r\n\nno appreciation of what he had done.  Counsel subsequently rested\r\n\nhis case without calling the promised doctors, although they were\r\n\navailable.  On appeal, this  court held that the failure to  call\r\n\nthese witnesses amounted  to ineffective  assistance of  counsel,\r\n\nstating that \"little  is more  damaging than to  fail to  produce\r\n\nimportant evidence that had been promised in an opening.\"  Id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n17.  \"The  first thing the  ultimately disappointed jurors  would\r\n\nbelieve,  in the absence of some other explanation, would be that\r\n\nthe doctors were  unwilling, viz.,  unable, to live  up to  their\r\n\nbilling.   This they  would not  forget.\"   Id.   \"[T]he  jurors'\r                                                         \r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nconclusion  would  remain  that  impartial experts  --  the  most\r\n\nqualified witnesses -- would not testify as counsel had said they\r\n\nwould; in effect a contradiction of the favorable  lay witnesses,\r\n\nmuch worse than if  he had not mentioned the  doctors initially.\"\r\n\nId.   Furthermore, \"to promise  even a condensed  recital of such\r             \r\n\npowerful  evidence,  and  then  not  produce  it,  could  not  be\r\n\ndisregarded as harmless.  We  find it prejudicial as a  matter of\r\n\nlaw.\"  Id. at 19.\r                    \r\n\n          The case at  bar raises similar concerns.   The opening\r\n\nstatements for the  defense included a promise to the jury that a\r\n\npsychiatrist would testify to  the effect that Robles exaggerates\r\n\nas a  result of his mental  illness.  Unlike in  Anderson, it was\r                                                                   \r\n\nthe district court that prevented the defense from fulfilling its\r\n\npromise to the jury.  Having obtained the  assurance of the court\r\n\nthat Dr.  Fumero would  be allowed  to  testify, defense  counsel\r\n\nstated as much  to the jury.   When the  court later changed  its\r\n\nmind and ruled that the expert would not be permitted to testify,\r\n\ndefendants were unable to produce the promised testimony.\r\n\n          Like  the jury in Anderson,  the jury in  this case was\r                                              \r\n\nlikely to infer from defense counsel's failure to call Dr. Fumero\r\n\nthat he  was unwilling to testify  for the defense.   Nor was the\r\n\njury informed of the fact that it  was the court's ruling, rather\r\n\nthan the  defendants'  decision, that  kept  Dr. Fumero  off  the\r\n\nstand. Although Anderson  concerned an ineffective assistance  of\r                                  \r\n\ncounsel  claim, the  principle  behind Anderson  applies in  this\r                                                         \r\n\ncase.   A defendant's opening statement prepares the jury to hear\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nhis  case.   If  the defense  fails  to produce  promised  expert\r\n\ntestimony  that is  critical to  the defense  strategy, a  danger\r\n\narises that the jury will presume that the expert is unwilling to\r\n\ntestify and the  defense is  flawed.  That  the defendant  should\r\n\nsuffer  this presumption because he  relied on a  prior ruling of\r\n\nthe trial court that  the same court later reversed,  rather than\r\n\nbecause of  poor judgment on the  part of his own  counsel, in no\r\n\nway changes the fact that the  presumption formed in the minds of\r\n\nthe jury  is prejudicial.   As we did  in Anderson, we  find that\r                                                            \r\n\npromising to admit  this important evidence  and then failing  to\r\n\nproduce it is prejudicial as a matter of law in the circumstances\r\n\nof this  case.    Following  Anderson, therefore,  we  find  that\r                                               \r\n\ndenying defendants the opportunity to have Dr. Fumero testify, in\r\n\nlight  of the fact  that the court's  decision on  the matter led\r\n\ndefense  counsel,  in  their  opening  remarks,  to  promise  the\r\n\nexpert's testimony to the jury, was reversible error.\r\n\n          B.   The Admissibility of Dr. Fumero's Testimony\r                    B.   The Admissibility of Dr. Fumero's Testimony\r\n\n          Appellants also  challenge the district  court's ruling\r\n\nthat  Dr.  Fumero's  testimony  is inadmissible.    On  appellate\r\n\nreview, \"[a] district court's decision to admit or exclude expert\r\n\ntestimony  is entitled  to  great deference.\"   United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nShay,  57 F.3d  126, 132 (1st  Cir. 1995).   We  will reverse the\r              \r\n\ntrial court's decision on this question only if \"(1) the district\r\n\ncourt based the decision  on an incorrect legal standard,  or (2)\r\n\nwe  have a 'definite  and firm conviction  that the  court made a\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nclear error of  judgment in the conclusion it  reached based on a\r\n\nweighing of the relevant factors.'\"  Id. (citations omitted).\r                                                  \r\n\n          Defendants' argument proceeds  as follows.  Dr.  Fumero\r\n\nwas a qualified  witness within  the meaning of  Federal Rule  of\r\n\nEvidence 702, as the court  agreed.  Tr. 8 at 1483.  He proffered\r\n\nto  the  court  that the  symptoms  of  Robles'  mental condition\r\n\ninclude \"verbosity;\" \"grandeza\" (\"[h]e  has to feel important and\r\n\nthe  center of  attention as  part of  his .  . .  fragmented ego\r\n\nneeds\"), Tr.  8 at  1497; and  exaggeration.   Because defendants\r\n\nfaced criminal charges  based largely  on recorded  conversations\r\n\ninvolving Robles,  and because the government  claimed that these\r\n\nconversations demonstrated  the existence of  a drug  conspiracy,\r\n\nthe  weight placed on the taped conversations  by the jury was of\r\n\nparamount importance.   Indeed, the defendants'  case was founded\r\n\non the view that  the recorded conversations were discussions  of\r\n\nlegitimate business dealings.   If  the jury  could be  convinced\r\n\nthat  Robles' testimony was  unreliable because he  had a medical\r\n\ncondition that  led him to exaggerate, it would be more likely to\r\n\nbelieve  the  defense theory  that  they were  involved  in legal\r\n\nbusiness activity.\r\n\n          The  district court ruled that Dr.  Fumero would not be\r\n\nallowed to testify on the ground that \"the fact that a person may\r\n\nsuffer a mental defect  or problem does not render  his testimony\r\n\ninadmissible.\"  Tr.  8 at  1459.  The  court stated further  that\r\n\n\"[y]ou  cannot bring a  witness and  say, well,  this man  is not\r\n\ntelling the truth  or he can't tell  the truth.\"  Tr.  8 at 1465.\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nThe court appears to have understood Dr. Fumero's testimony to be\r\n\nrelated to the competency of  Robles:  \"What I suggest to  you is\r\n\nthat we give to the jury a stipulation that Julio Robles had been\r\n\nheld not competent  to stand trial  at this time  but that he  is\r\n\nbeing evaluated further.\"  Tr. 8 at 1466.\r\n\n          It is well established that a witness' mental state can\r\n\nbe relevant to  the issue  of the witness'  credibility.   United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.  Butt, 955 F.2d 77, 82 (1st Cir. 1992).  The competency\r                         \r\n\nof a  witness to  testify is  a determination to  be made  by the\r\n\ntrial judge, but issues of credibility are for the trier of fact.\r\n\nSee United States v. Carroll, 105 F.3d  740, 743 (1st Cir. 1997);\r                                      \r\n\nUnited States v. Hyson, 721 F.2d 856, 864 (1st Cir. 1983).\r                                \r\n\n          The ability of parties to offer expert testimony on the\r\n\nquestion  of  credibility  is  not, however,  unlimited.    \"[A]n\r\n\nexpert's  opinion that  another witness  is lying or  telling the\r\n\ntruth is ordinarily inadmissible pursuant to Rule 702 because the\r\n\nopinion exceeds  the scope of the  expert's specialized knowledge\r\n\nand  therefore merely  informs the  jury that  it should  reach a\r\n\nparticular conclusion.\"   Shay,  57 F.3d  at 131.

Shortly after the bombing,\r                              \r\n\nhe told a police officer  that \"he was sorry about it  and wished\r\n\nhe  could turn  back the  hands of  time.\"   Id.

As\r\n\npart of his  defense, Shay  Jr. sought  to call  Dr. Phillips,  a\r\n\npsychiatrist, to  testify that Shay  Jr. suffered  from a  mental\r\n\ndisorder known  as \"pseudolog a fant stica.\"   The expert witness\r\n\nwas to testify  that this  illness caused Shay  Jr. to  fabricate\r\n\nself-aggrandizing lies  that would  place him  at  the center  of\r\n\nattention.   Id.  at 129-30.   The  district court  excluded this\r                          \r\n\ntestimony  on the ground that the jury was capable of determining\r\n\nthe reliability of Shay Jr.'s statements.\r\n\n          The Shay  panel held that  expert psychiatric testimony\r                            \r\n\ncan  be  admitted in  appropriate  circumstances  to establish  a\r\n\nwitness' \"character for truthfulness.\"  Id. at 131.  The  instant\r                                                     \r\n\ncase  is governed  by  Shay, and  our  analysis follows  the  one\r                                     \r\n\nadopted there.\r\n\n          Neither party challenges Dr. Fumero's qualifications as\r\n\nan expert.  The proffered testimony  concerned the mental illness\r\n\nof  Robles and  its impact  on his behavior  -- implying  that it\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\nconcerned \"scientific, technical or  specialized knowledge.\"  The\r\n\nremaining question is whether it would have assisted the trier of\r\n\nfact to understand the evidence or to determine  a fact in issue.\r\n\nThe  question that a court  must answer in  determining whether a\r\n\nproposed expert's  testimony  will assist  the trier  of fact  is\r\n\n\"whether  the untrained  layman would  be qualified  to determine\r\n\nintelligently  and  to  the  best degree,  the  particular  issue\r\n\nwithout enlightenment  from those having a  special understanding\r\n\nof  the subject matter involved.\"  Id. at 132 (internal quotation\r                                                \r\n\nmarks  omitted).   Dr. Fumero's  testimony  would  have discussed\r\n\nRobles' mental  illness.   Dr. Fumero  would have  testified that\r\n\nRobles, as a result of his illness, was prone to exaggeration.\r\n\n          Moreover, this  case has  a unique dimension.   Because\r\n\nRobles  was incompetent  to testify,  the jury  did not  have the\r\n\nusual chance to evaluate his demeanor.  Yet, the tapes containing\r\n\nhis statements were  introduced, and  they were  damaging to  the\r\n\ndefense.   In light of  the fact that  the government's  case was\r\n\nheavily dependent  on  Robles' taped  conversations,  we  believe\r\n\nthat,  in these unusual circumstance, the testimony that he had a\r\n\nmental   illness  that   led  to  \"verbosity,\"   \"grandeza,\"  and\r\n\nexaggeration  was highly  relevant and  that an  untrained layman\r\n\nwould not  be qualified  to determine  intelligently, and to  the\r\n\nbest degree the weight to  place on Robles's recorded  statements\r\n\nwithout enlightenment from Dr. Fumero.\r\n\n          The  government  argues  that  Dr.  Fumero's  testimony\r\n\nshould  be disallowed  because  the taped  conversations featured\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\ncurrent actions  which were largely corroborated.   To the extent\r\n\nthat Robles did suffer from the mental illness at issue, however,\r\n\nDr. Fumero's  testimony could be  relevant to the  credibility of\r\n\ncurrent  statements.     The   defense  theory  is   that  Robles\r\n\nexaggerated his situation in  statements that he made --  a claim\r\n\nfor which Dr. Fumero's testimony  is clearly relevant.  That  the\r\n\nstatements  were,  in the  view of  the government,  accurate, is\r\n\nsomething for the jury to consider in its deliberations.  It goes\r\n\nto the weight to be given to  the evidence and is not a reason to\r\n\nexclude Dr. Fumero's testimony.\r\n\n          We conclude,  therefore, that the  district court erred\r\n\nin refusing to allow Dr. Fumero to testify.2\r\n\n           II.  The Use of the Government's Transcripts\r                     II.  The Use of the Government's Transcripts\r\n\n          A.  The Transcripts\r                    A.  The Transcripts\r\n\n          Defendants also claim that  transcripts provided by the\r\n\ngovernment and used by  the jury should not have  been permitted.\r\n\nThe government provided transcripts of the taped conversations to\r\n\nthe jury so that when the tape was played, the  jury could follow\r\n\nalong  on the  transcripts.   The transcripts  included quotation\r\n\nmarks around certain words that the government claimed  were code\r\n\nwords used to  conceal the illegal  nature of the  conversations.\r\n\nFor  example, quotation marks  were placed  around words  such as\r\n\n\"ticket,\"  which the  government claimed  referred to  money, and\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2   We need not engage in a harmless error analysis at this point\r\nbecause we  are  reversing and  remanding  on other  grounds,  as\r\ndiscussed in the preceding section of this opinion.\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\n\"accident,\"  which allegedly  referred  to  arrest.   Defendants'\r\n\nobjection to these transcripts was overruled.\r\n\n          This circuit  allows the use  of transcripts as  a jury\r\n\naid  to tape recording playback.   See United  States v. Carbone,\r                                                                          \r\n\n798 F.2d 21, 26 (1st Cir. 1986).  Where transcripts are used, the\r\n\njudge should,  as was done  here, \"make clear [to  the jury] that\r\n\nthe tapes, not the transcript, constitute  evidence in the case.\"\r\n\nUnited  States v.  Richman, 600  F.2d 286,  295 (1st  Cir. 1979).\r                                    \r\n\nFurthermore, we have stated that:\r\n\n            Even if transcripts  are not admitted  in\r\n            evidence, in the sense of being marked as\r\n            exhibits, they are read and relied  on by\r\n            the jury  to follow  the playback.   They\r\n            should,  therefore,  be  as  accurate  as\r\n            possible.\r\n\nCarbone, 798 F.2d at 27.\r                 \r\n\n          The  quotation marks used  in the transcripts submitted\r\n\nto the jury in this case  reflect the government's theory of  the\r\n\ncase.  The  government does not claim  that there is any  audible\r\n\nemphasis or  other vocal  inflection placed  on the marked  words\r\n\nthat is discernible when  listening to the tape and  failed, both\r\n\nat trial and on  appeal, to offer any legitimate  explanation for\r\n\nthe  quotation marks.   We  hold that  the trial  court committed\r\n\nerred when  it  allowed the  use  of transcripts  that  contained\r\n\nquotation marks around certain words.  It is not  enough that the\r\n\ncourt  instructed the  jury  that only  the  tapes, and  not  the\r\n\ntranscripts,  were evidence.  Nor is it enough for the government\r\n\nto subsequently present evidence that the words were  code words.\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\nThe government should not  be allowed to bolster its  argument by\r\n\ncustomizing the transcript to reflect its own theory of the case.\r\n\n          B.  The Agents' Interpretation of the Transcript\r                    B.  The Agents' Interpretation of the Transcript\r\n\n          The next claim advanced by appellants is that the court\r\n\nerred  when  it  allowed  FBI agents  to  interpret  the recorded\r\n\nconversations.     Appellants'  briefs  fail  to  offer  detailed\r\n\ndescriptions  of the  incidents  to which  they object,  although\r\n\nGonz lez-Maldonado's brief cites to  seventeen incidents that are\r\n\ngenerally  alleged to  represent occasions  on which  the agents'\r\n\ninterpretations  went  beyond   interpretation  of  code   words.\r\n\nAlthough appellants objected on certain occasions, they failed to\r\n\nobject  on many  of the  instances cited  in Gonz lez-Maldonado's\r\n\nbrief.\r\n\n          Although  expert  testimony  is permitted  in  order to\r\n\nassist  the jury  in understanding  \"code-like\" conversations  in\r\n\ntape recordings,  interpretations of clear conversations  are not\r\n\nadmissible.  See  United States  v. Montas, 41  F.3d 775,  783-84\r                                                    \r\n\n(1st  Cir. 1994); United States v. Lamattina, 889 F.2d 1191, 1194\r                                                      \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1989).\r\n\n            Expert testimony  on  a subject  that  is\r\n            well   within  the  bounds  of  a  jury's\r\n            ordinary experience  generally has little\r\n            probative value.  On the other  hand, the\r\n            risk  of unfair  prejudice is  real.   By\r\n            appearing  to put  the expert's  stamp of\r\n            approval on the government's theory, such\r\n            testimony  might   unduly  influence  the\r\n            jury's  own  assessment of  the inference\r\n            that is being urged.\r\n\nMontas, 41 F.3d at 784.\r                \r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\n          We are conscious of the fact that the interpretation of\r\n\nalleged  code-words used by the defendants in a complex case such\r\n\nas  this  may require  the expert  to  make statements  about the\r\n\ncontext  in which those words  are being used.   Nevertheless, we\r\n\nfind that in some of the instances cited by appellants, the court\r\n\nerred  by allowing  FBI  agents to  comment  on clear  statements\r\n\ncontained  on the  tapes.   Because  we  are reversing  on  other\r\n\ngrounds, we need not review each alleged transgression.  Instead,\r\n\nwe offer an example, in the  hope that such errors can be avoided\r\n\nif there is another trial.\r\n\n          At one  point Agent  Plichta observed, in  reference to\r\n\none of  the recordings, that  the participants in  a conversation\r\n\n\"appeared  relieved when they -- when they -- when they discussed\r\n\nthe fact that apparently they'd been able to make the delivery of\r\n\nmoney  and nothing  happened.   They  were  both relieved  and  I\r\n\nbelieve one  of them even chuckles a  bit about that.\"   Tr. 5 at\r\n\n848.  That the speakers  on the tape were, or were  not, relieved\r\n\nis for the jury to determine, and the testimony of the agent does\r\n\nnot assist them in this effort.\r\n\n          III.  Spanish Definitions in Jury Instructions\r                    III.  Spanish Definitions in Jury Instructions\r\n\n          Appellant Montalvo claims that the district court erred\r\n\nin its instructions to  the jury.  Specifically, he  alleges that\r\n\nthe  court included in its  definition of the  term \"willfully\" a\r\n\nSpanish translation that is inaccurate.\r\n\n          In  delivering its instructions,  the court  stated the\r\n\nfollowing:\r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\n               The word \"knowingly,\" as that term has\r\n            been  used from  time  to time  in  these\r\n            instructions, means that the act was done\r\n            voluntarily  and  intentionally  and  not\r\n            because of mistake or accident.  That is,\r\n            \"knowingly\" means in Spanish a sabiendas.\r                                                              \r\n\n             The   word   \"willfully\"   --  that   is\r\n            voluntariamente  in  Spanish  -- as  that\r                                     \r\n            term has  been used from time  to time in\r\n            these  instructions,  means that  the act\r\n            was  committed voluntarily  and purposely\r\n            with  the specific intent to do something\r\n            the law forbids; that is to say, with bad\r\n            purpose  either  to disobey  or disregard\r\n            the law . . . .\r\n\n               Now,   unlawfully    --   in   Spanish\r\n            ilegalmente -- means contrary to law.\r                                 \r\n\nTr. 9 at 1704-05.\r\n\n          Montalvo  argues  that   the  term  voluntariamente  is\r                                                                       \r\n\nequivalent  to  the  English  term  \"voluntary\"  and,  therefore,\r\n\nrepresents  only  one  aspect  of willfulness.    As  the English\r\n\ndefinition suggests,  willfulness also  requires that the  act be\r\n\ncommitted  purposely and with the intent to do something that the\r\n\nlaw forbids.  See United States v. Yefsky, 994 F.2d 885, 899 (1st\r                                                   \r\n\nCir.  1993).   We  conclude  that  Montalvo  is  correct  in  his\r\n\nassertion that  the term voluntariamente means  \"voluntary.\"  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nThe  Collins Spanish-English  English-Spanish Dictionary  (2d ed.\r\n\n1988).  It follows that the  use of this term in order  to assist\r\n\njurors,   whose  predominant   language   may   be  Spanish,   in\r\n\nunderstanding the term \"willfully\" was ill-advised.   We need not\r\n\ninquire into  the question  of whether  it  is reversible  error,\r\n\nhowever, as we are reversing the judgment on other grounds.\r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\n          We add the following  note of caution.  Although  we do\r\n\nnot believe that there should be an absolute rule prohibiting the\r\n\nuse of non-English words when instructing the jury, we do believe\r\n\nthat this practice is inadvisable and should be discouraged.  The\r\n\nEnglish  meaning  of  the   word  \"willfully,\"  for  example,  is\r\n\nadequately covered by an instruction such as those that have been\r\n\napproved by this court in the past.  See, e.g.,  United States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nShadduck,  Nos. 95-1395, 95-1396,  96-1342,     F.3d   ,  1997 WL\r                  \r\n\n191877, at  *4 (April 24,  1997); Yefsky, 994  F.2d at 899.3   We\r                                                  \r\n\ntherefore instruct  the district courts to  frame instructions in\r\n\nEnglish.\r\n\n                  IV.  The Admission of Evidence\r                            IV.  The Admission of Evidence\r\n\n          A.   The Lottery Check\r                    A.   The Lottery Check\r\n\n          At  trial, the  government  admitted  into  evidence  a\r\n\nphotocopy of a  1992 lottery  check seized from  Montalvo at  the\r\n\ntime of his  arrest.  The  check was in  the amount of  $250,000.\r\n\nThe government introduced the evidence because Robles revealed to\r\n\nthe undercover team that he had provided a winning lottery ticket\r\n\nin the amount of $250,000 to a friend of Papo who, the government\r\n\nclaimed,  was in the drug  business.  That  appellant possessed a\r\n\ncheck for the exact amount was, the government  argued, probative\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n3  Reasonable proficiency  in teh English language is  a required\r\nqualification  for a  juror.  See  28 U.S.C.    1865(b)(2) &amp; (3);\r                                           \r\nUnited  States v.  Aponte-Su rez,  905 F.2d  483,  492 (1st  Cir.\r                                          \r\n1990). That juries  understand English is also  a practical need.\r\nThe use of English is necessary for the  creation of an appellate\r\nrecord  which will  be read by  appellate judges  who may  not be\r\nversant in other languages, and who do not have the benefit of an\r\nofficial translator as is available in district courts.\r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\nof his  involvement in the alleged conspiracy.   Furthermore, the\r\n\ngovernment  claims that  the fact  that the  check was  dated two\r\n\nyears before the events  described does not change the  fact that\r\n\nit  was relevant because Papo  had worked with  Robles for a long\r\n\ntime and the check was offered  to demonstrate the existence of a\r\n\nconspiracy long before the events of May through July 1994.\r\n\n          Appellant  Montalvo  claims   that  the  check   lacked\r\n\nrelevance to the  case.  He claims that \"[t]here  was no evidence\r\n\nto  show  that the  ticket  had come  from  Robles,  that it  was\r\n\npurchased  with  the proceeds  of  drug transactions  or  that it\r\n\nevidenced Montalvo's involvement with Robles in drug distribution\r\n\nat some earlier  time.\"  Brief of Appellant Montalvo,  at 32.  In\r\n\nessence, appellant  contends that  there was nothing  to indicate\r\n\nthat  the  check  was evidence  of  any  element  of any  charged\r\n\noffense.\r\n\n          We add that, at sentencing, the  judge stated, \"I don't\r\n\nfind  a  reasonable  connection  for  this  case  to  find  by  a\r\n\npreponderance of  the evidence  that the $250,000  lottery ticket\r\n\nthat was purchased is part of this conspiracy, and therefore I am\r\n\nexcluding it.\"  Transcript of Sentencing, at 10.\r\n\n          We  review  this  evidentiary   ruling  for  abuse   of\r\n\ndiscretion.  United States  v. Brandon, 17 F.3d 409,  443-44 (1st\r                                                \r\n\nCir. 1994).\r\n\n          Our  review  of  the  testimony  fails  to  reveal  any\r\n\ndemonstrated connection  between the  photocopy of the  check and\r\n\nthe charges  brought  against defendants.    The check  was  from\r\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\nbefore the  dates at issue in  this case and no  evidence was put\r\n\nforward to  suggest that it  was connected to  drug transactions,\r\n\nexcept the  general claim by  the government that  lottery checks\r\n\nwere  used to  launder money.   The  government argued  at trial,\r\n\nhowever, that the check was relevant to demonstrate the existence\r\n\nof  the conspiracy  prior  to the  dates  at  issue.   Given  our\r\n\ndeferential standard of review, we, therefore,  do not find abuse\r\n\nof   discretion  in  this  case.    Although  we  might  conclude\r\n\ndifferently if our  review were de  novo, we do not  believe that\r                                                  \r\n\nthe court abused its discretion in accepting this argument.4\r\n\n          B.  The Notebook Seized During Montalvo's Arrest\r                    B.  The Notebook Seized During Montalvo's Arrest\r\n\n          Appellant Montalvo  also objects to the  admission of a\r\n\nnotebook  seized at  his home  at the  time of  his arrest.   The\r\n\ngovernment's  expert witness,  FBI Agent  Carl  Jensen, testified\r\n\nthat  \"[t]he submitted documents are in a format of records which\r\n\ncould  be   maintained  in   connection  with  an   illicit  drug\r\n\ndistribution  business.\"  Tr. 7  at 1203.   Appellant argues that\r\n\nthe  notebook  had  no  probative  value  because  there  was  no\r\n\nindication as  to when or  by whom  the notations had  been made,\r\n\nthere were no initials  or names, no dollar signs  or terminology\r\n\nattached  to the numbers, and no  correlation between the numbers\r\n\nin the notebook and the amounts involved in the offenses charged.\r\n\n          Our  review is, once  again, on an  abuse of discretion\r\n\nstandard and  we do  not find  such abuse  here.  The  government\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n4  Our failure to find abuse of discretion, of course, should not\r\nbe  taken as determinative of whether the lottery check should be\r\nadmitted in a future trial.\r\n\n                               -23-\r\r\n\nadvanced the testimony  of an expert  witness who testified  that\r\n\nthe  notebook appeared to be  a record of  drug transactions; and\r\n\nthat it \"lack[ed] the class characteristics [one] would expect to\r\n\nfind with  legitimate type  business records,\"  Tr. 228 at  1203-\r\n\n1204;  and  that  the  apparent  prices  in   the  notebook  were\r\n\nconsistent with the prices  of kilogram quantities of cocaine  in\r\n\ncentral Florida,  where appellant Montalvo lived  during the time\r\n\nframe of these events.\r\n\n          Based  on this testimony, we do not find that the court\r\n\nabused its  discretion in  admitting the notebook  into evidence.\r\n\nThe trial  court was in a much better position than this court to\r\n\nassess the relevance of the notebook.  The decision to admit  the\r\n\nnotebook was within the sound discretion of the district court.\r\n\n          C.  Notebook Seized from Robles\r                    C.  Notebook Seized from Robles\r\n\n          Appellant Montalvo  next claims error in  the admission\r\n\nof a notebook seized from Robles' home on the ground  that it was\r\n\nnot  adequately authenticated  as  required by  Federal Rules  of\r\n\nEvidence 901.5  We review for abuse of discretion.

The Federal  Rules of  Evidence take  a\r                       \r\n\nflexible approach to this issue.  The document's authenticity may\r\n\nbe  confirmed  by  \"[a]ppearance,  contents,  substance, internal\r\n\npatterns,   or  other   distinctive  characteristics,   taken  in\r\n\nconjunction with circumstances.\"   Id.

Such  circumstantial evidence  is permitted  in order  to\r\n\nauthenticate the item.   Id. at  680.   We do not  find that  the\r                                      \r\n\ndistrict court  abused its discretion in  admitting this document\r\n\ninto evidence.6\r\n\n              V.  Sufficiency of the Evidence Claims\r                        V.  Sufficiency of the Evidence Claims\r\n\n          Appellants seek  to have their convictions reversed and\r\n\nthe  case dismissed  on the  grounds that there  was insufficient\r\n\nevidence, as a matter of law, to convict them.  In reviewing such\r\n\na claim, we must  determine if, \"after assaying all  the evidence\r\n\nin  the  light most  amiable to  the  government, and  taking all\r\n\nreasonable inferences  in its favor, a  rational factfinder could\r\n\nfind,   beyond   a  reasonable   doubt,   that  the   prosecution\r\n\nsuccessfully proved the essential elements of the case.\"   United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.

It was for the jury to determine whether these\r\n\nconversations related to legitimate  business dealings or illegal\r\n\ndrug transactions.    Viewing  the  evidence in  the  light  most\r\n\namiable to  the government,  we conclude  that a reasonable  jury\r\n\ncould  have  concluded  that   the  conversations  in  the  tapes\r\n\nconcerned drug  related transactions.  With  respect to Montalvo,\r\n\nthe  jury could also have  inferred guilt from  the notebooks and\r\n\nthe lottery check put  into evidence.  With respect  to Gonz lez-\r\n\nMaldonado, evidence was presented that transactions took place at\r\n\nhis  place of business and a reasonable jury could have concluded\r\n\nthat the taped conversations  demonstrated his involvement in the\r\n\nconspiracy and  the money laundering.   These conversations could\r\n\nbe interpreted to have  dealt with cocaine that had  been damaged\r\n\nin shipment, cocaine stored at his place of business, and cocaine\r\n\nto be imported in  the future.  Such inferences  were permissible\r\n\nand,  therefore, we find the sufficiency of the evidence claim to\r\n\nbe without merit.\r\n\n                         VI.

Because we  are remanding  the case, we  need not\r\n\nreach this  issue.  In the  event of a new  trial, with different\r\n\ntestimony and different arguments,  the trial court will be  in a\r\n\nbetter  position than we are  today to determine  the quantity of\r\n\ndrugs  for  which  appellants,   if  convicted,  should  be  held\r\n\n                               -27-\r\r\n\nresponsible, and to make an evaluation of defendants' role in the\r\n\noffense.\r\n\n                         VII.

For the reasons stated herein we vacate their convictions and remand to the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal from a conviction, we review the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict.  See United States v. Staula, 80 F.3d 596, 599 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 156, 136 L.Ed.2d 101 (1996).  On that basis, the jury could have found the following facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the spring of 1993, the FBI began a money laundering investigation.  An undercover FBI agent, Agent Martn Suarez, and an informant infiltrated a money laundering organization that worked under the direction of a man known as \"Honcho.\"   Honcho communicated to Agent Suarez and the informant that they would be contacted through their pager, by a person using the code \"Romero 55.\"   On May 24, 1994, Agent Suarez received a page from Romero 55 and contacted him by phone.  Agent Suarez, the informant, and Romero 55--who was later identified as Julio Robles-Torres (\"Robles\")--arranged to meet the following day, at which time Romero 55 delivered approximately $600,000 to Agent Suarez and the informant.  The conversation that took place at the meeting was recorded, although there were periods when the recorder malfunctioned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the court admitted the taped conversation into evidence over the objection of defense counsel.  Agent Suarez testified that during the interrupted portion of the tape, Robles indicated that he had started an individual named \"Papo\" in \"this business\" and that Papo had made six million dollars.  Agent Suarez testified that, in the context of the conversation, he interpreted \"this business\" to mean the drug business.  The exchange between Agent Suarez and government counsel went as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>Agent Suarez:  I recall that he had mentioned that he had started Papo in this business.  He had--also mentioned that Papo was in the car repair business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>Government:  Okay.  When you say that he started--he, Robles, had started Papo in that business, what business is he talking about?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>Agent Suarez:  In the drug business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. 2 at 278.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the taped conversation, Robles also stated that he had given a lottery ticket in the amount of $250,000 to a friend of Papo.  Agent Suarez testified that drug smugglers buy winning lottery tickets in order to launder money.  There was no mention of Montalvo or Gonzalez-Maldonado during the taped conversation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the delivery of $600,000 and the conversation between Agent Suarez and Robles, the government obtained a court order authorizing the interception of communications on Robles' cellular phone.  At trial, the government introduced more than sixty of these intercepted calls.  The government states that in fifteen of those calls, appellant Montalvo, identified as \"Ito,\" spoke with Robles;  and in ten calls, Gonzalez-Maldonado, identified as \"Nori,\" spoke with Robles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 27, 1994, FBI Special Agent Daniel Gonzalez intercepted a conversation between Robles and Papo.  During that conversation, Robles and Papo referred to \"tickets.\"   Agent Gonzalez, over objection, testified that the word \"ticket\" referred to money.  Neither appellant participated in or was mentioned during the call.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 28, 1994, six conversations were intercepted by police.  The jury could have concluded that appellant Montalvo participated in one of these calls.  The first call was to appellant Gonzalez-Maldonado at his store, Mazda Fever.  Gonzalez-Maldonado indicated that he had four tickets, and Robles said that they could combine their tickets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on these calls, another FBI Special Agent, Michael Plichta, set up surveillance at Mazda Fever.  He observed Robles arrive in a gray Volvo around 4:00 p.m., on June 28, meet briefly with an unidentified male, and then drive around back, where he remained, out of sight, for twenty minutes.  At 4:20 p.m., an individual identified only as \"Chepe\" called Robles, who stated that he was picking up the tickets at that moment and that he would proceed to deliver them.  When Robles departed, he was followed to a Ponderosa restaurant, where he met briefly with two men.  Shortly thereafter, the two men were detained and $715,309 was seized from a suitcase and a cardboard box found in their car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following day, Papo and Robles had three telephone conversations about the seizure, including the question of who would assume responsibility for the lost money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In recorded conversations on July 8, 1994, Robles confirmed with Montalvo and an individual identified as \"Gurucho\" that Gonzalez-Maldonado had all the tickets.  In his conversation with Gurucho, Robles indicated that Gurucho should contact Gonzalez-Maldonado about a delivery.  Gonzalez informed Robles that Gurucho had directed them to make a delivery to an individual identified as \"Nina\" at the Condado Plaza Hotel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 9, 1994, the FBI established surveillance at the Condado Plaza Hotel.  FBI Special Agent Jane Peltier testified that Robles went to Mazda Fever around 8:30 a.m.  Shortly after, he left Mazda Fever and proceeded to the Condado Plaza Hotel parking garage, arriving around 9:00 a.m.  Carrying a gray bag, he went to the eighth floor, and then left the hotel empty-handed.  FBI agents entered room 825 and recovered the gray bag and seized $243,600 from the safe in the room.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of Montalvo's arrest, police seized, among other things, a photocopy of a Puerto Rico lottery check, two pagers, and two notebooks.  In addition to Montalvo and Gonzalez-Maldonado, the police arrested Robles.  The three were to be tried together until, in March 1995, Robles was found incompetent to stand trial and the case against him was severed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants assert several claims on appeal.  We find some of those claims valid, warranting reversal of the convictions.  In order to give as much guidance as possible to the district court, we also discuss some of the other claims that are likely to resurface if there is a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>I. The Psychiatric Testimony of Dr. Jose Fumero</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants argue that the district court erred in excluding the testimony of Dr. Fumero, the psychiatrist who had, at the court's direction, initially examined Robles for competency.  This claim includes two distinct arguments.  First, appellants claim that the court erred in excluding Dr. Fumero's testimony after defense counsel had relied on an earlier ruling that the testimony would be allowed.  Second, appellants assert that the court's decision to exclude Fumero's testimony was based on the mistaken belief that the testimony was offered only to address the issue of Robles' competency as a witness.  Appellants contend that the testimony was actually offered to:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>provide information concerning Robles' medical history and his diagnosed schizophrenia, and the possible ramifications of Robles' illness for evaluation of the evidence to be introduced at trial--to provide information relevant to whether, as a result of his mental disease or defect Robles was unable to appreciate the nature and quality or wrongfulness of his acts in May-June, 1994;  or whether aspects of his illness were relevant to assessing the reliability and meaning of Robles' statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brief of Appellant Montalvo, at 17.  We deal with each claim in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Opening Statements</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to trial, defense counsel met with Dr. Fumero, who had conducted the competency examination of Robles.  Fumero opined that Robles was suffering from a mental illness at the time of the offenses and that his mental illness resulted in a tendency to exaggerate.  Defense counsel informed the court that he intended to have Fumero testify at trial, arguing that Fumero's testimony should be admitted so that the jury could determine the weight to be given to the taped conversations.  Tr. 1 at 7. The court stated that it would \"let Dr. Fumero testify and then let that go to the jury.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Tr. 1 at 21.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During opening statements, counsel for both defendants made reference to Robles' mental state.  Counsel for Gonzalez-Maldonado promised the jury that he would produce a psychiatrist who would testify that a person in Robles' condition \"exaggerates, and that everything that he talks about is greater.\"   Tr. 1 at 163.  Counsel for Montalvo, in his opening statement, stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>The expert selected by this Court, Dr. Fumero, selected by this Court, will come here, will sit there and will testify that during this conspiracy ... Mr. Julio Robles-Torres was mentally insane.  Therefore, you cannot trust him.  You cannot put much attention to what he's saying because he exaggerates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. 1 at 169.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the presentation of defendants' case, the court reconsidered its earlier decision and decided that Dr. Fumero would not be allowed to testify because the testimony would only go to the issue of Robles' competency as a witness, which is a question for the court, and that evidence of a mental defect does not render testimony inadmissible.  See Tr. 8 at 1506.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants argue that even if Fumero's testimony was properly excluded, the court committed reversible error by first ruling that it would permit Fumero to testify and then, after the close of the government's case, ruling that his testimony would be excluded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Anderson v. Butler, 858 F.2d 16 (1st Cir.1988), defense counsel, in his opening, told the jury that he would call a psychiatrist and a psychologist to show that the defendant had no appreciation of what he had done.  Counsel subsequently rested his case without calling the promised doctors, although they were available.  On appeal, this court held that the failure to call these witnesses amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel, stating that \"little is more damaging than to fail to produce important evidence that had been promised in an opening.\"  Id. at 17.  \"The first thing the ultimately disappointed jurors would believe, in the absence of some other explanation, would be that the doctors were unwilling, viz., unable, to live up to their billing.  This they would not forget.\"  Id. \"[T]he jurors' conclusion would remain that impartial experts--the most qualified witnesses--would not testify as counsel had said they would;  in effect a contradiction of the favorable lay witnesses, much worse than if he had not mentioned the doctors initially.\"  Id. Furthermore, \"to promise even a condensed recital of such powerful evidence, and then not produce it, could not be disregarded as harmless.  We find it prejudicial as a matter of law.\"  Id. at 19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case at bar raises similar concerns.  The opening statements for the defense included a promise to the jury that a psychiatrist would testify to the effect that Robles exaggerates as a result of his mental illness.  Unlike in Anderson, it was the district court that prevented the defense from fulfilling its promise to the jury.  Having obtained the assurance of the court that Dr. Fumero would be allowed to testify, defense counsel stated as much to the jury.  When the court later changed its mind and ruled that the expert would not be permitted to testify, defendants were unable to produce the promised testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the jury in Anderson, the jury in this case was likely to infer from defense counsel's failure to call Dr. Fumero that he was unwilling to testify for the defense.  Nor was the jury informed of the fact that it was the court's ruling, rather than the defendants' decision, that kept Dr. Fumero off the stand.  Although Anderson concerned an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the principle behind Anderson applies in this case.  A defendant's opening statement prepares the jury to hear his case.  If the defense fails to produce promised expert testimony that is critical to the defense strategy, a danger arises that the jury will presume that the expert is unwilling to testify and the defense is flawed.  That the defendant should suffer this presumption because he relied on a prior ruling of the trial court that the same court later reversed, rather than because of poor judgment on the part of his own counsel, in no way changes the fact that the presumption formed in the minds of the jury is prejudicial.  As we did in Anderson, we find that promising to admit this important evidence and then failing to produce it is prejudicial as a matter of law in the circumstances of this case.  Following Anderson, therefore, we find that denying defendants the opportunity to have Dr. Fumero testify, in light of the fact that the court's decision on the matter led defense counsel, in their opening remarks, to promise the expert's testimony to the jury, was reversible error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Admissibility of Dr. Fumero's Testimony</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants also challenge the district court's ruling that Dr. Fumero's testimony is inadmissible.  On appellate review, \"[a] district court's decision to admit or exclude expert testimony is entitled to great deference.\"  United States v. Shay, 57 F.3d 126, 132 (1st Cir.1995).  We will reverse the trial court's decision on this question only if \"(1) the district court based the decision on an incorrect legal standard, or (2) we have a 'definite and firm conviction that the court made a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached based on a weighing of the relevant factors.' \"  Id. (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants' argument proceeds as follows.  Dr. Fumero was a qualified witness within the meaning of Federal Rule of Evidence 702, as the court agreed.  Tr. 8 at 1483.  He proffered to the court that the symptoms of Robles' mental condition include \"verbosity;\" \"grandeza\" (\"[h]e has to feel important and the center of attention as part of his ... fragmented ego needs\"), Tr. 8 at 1497;  and exaggeration.  Because defendants faced criminal charges based largely on recorded conversations involving Robles, and because the government claimed that these conversations demonstrated the existence of a drug conspiracy, the weight placed on the taped conversations by the jury was of paramount importance.  Indeed, the defendants' case was founded on the view that the recorded conversations were discussions of legitimate business dealings.  If the jury could be convinced that Robles' testimony was unreliable because he had a medical condition that led him to exaggerate, it would be more likely to believe the defense theory that they were involved in legal business activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled that Dr. Fumero would not be allowed to testify on the ground that \"the fact that a person may suffer a mental defect or problem does not render his testimony inadmissible.\"   Tr. 8 at 1459.  The court stated further that \"[y]ou cannot bring a witness and say, well, this man is not telling the truth or he can't tell the truth.\"   Tr. 8 at 1465.  The court appears to have understood Dr. Fumero's testimony to be related to the competency of Robles:  \"What I suggest to you is that we give to the jury a stipulation that Julio Robles had been held not competent to stand trial at this time but that he is being evaluated further.\"   Tr. 8 at 1466.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well established that a witness' mental state can be relevant to the issue of the witness' credibility.  United States v. Butt, 955 F.2d 77, 82 (1st Cir.1992).  The competency of a witness to testify is a determination to be made by the trial judge, but issues of credibility are for the trier of fact.  See United States v. Carroll, 105 F.3d 740, 743 (1st Cir.1997);  United States v. Hyson, 721 F.2d 856, 864 (1st Cir.1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ability of parties to offer expert testimony on the question of credibility is not, however, unlimited.  \"[A]n expert's opinion that another witness is lying or telling the truth is ordinarily inadmissible pursuant to Rule 702 because the opinion exceeds the scope of the expert's specialized knowledge and therefore merely informs the jury that it should reach a particular conclusion.\"  Shay, 57 F.3d at 131.   On the other hand, \"no constitutional provision, law, or rule requires the exclusion of expert testimony simply because it concerns a credibility question.\"  Id. To be admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 702, a proposed expert witness must:  (1) be qualified to testify as an expert by \"knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education,\" Fed.R.Evid. 702;  (2) the testimony must concern \"scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge,\" Fed.R.Evid. 702;  and (3) the testimony must \"assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\"  Fed.R.Evid. 702.  Shay, 57 F.3d at 132.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Shay, the defendant, Shay Jr., was convicted of \"conspiracy and aiding and abetting an attempt to blow up his father's car.\"  Shay, 57 F.3d at 128.   Shortly after the bombing, he told a police officer that \"he was sorry about it and wished he could turn back the hands of time.\"  Id. The government argued that this statement was evidence of Shay Jr.'s guilt.  As part of his defense, Shay Jr. sought to call Dr. Phillips, a psychiatrist, to testify that Shay Jr. suffered from a mental disorder known as \"pseudologa fantastica.\"   The expert witness was to testify that this illness caused Shay Jr. to fabricate self-aggrandizing lies that would place him at the center of attention.  Id. at 129-30.   The district court excluded this testimony on the ground that the jury was capable of determining the reliability of Shay Jr.'s statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Shay panel held that expert psychiatric testimony can be admitted in appropriate circumstances to establish a witness' \"character for truthfulness.\"  Id. at 131.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The instant case is governed by Shay, and our analysis follows the one adopted there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither party challenges Dr. Fumero's qualifications as an expert.  The proffered testimony concerned the mental illness of Robles and its impact on his behavior--implying that it concerned \"scientific, technical or specialized knowledge.\"   The remaining question is whether it would have assisted the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.  The question that a court must answer in determining whether a proposed expert's testimony will assist the trier of fact is \"whether the untrained layman would be qualified to determine intelligently and to the best degree, the particular issue without enlightenment from those having a special understanding of the subject matter involved.\"  Id. at 132 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Dr. Fumero's testimony would have discussed Robles' mental illness.  Dr. Fumero would have testified that Robles, as a result of his illness, was prone to exaggeration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, this case has a unique dimension.  Because Robles was incompetent to testify, the jury did not have the usual chance to evaluate his demeanor.  Yet, the tapes containing his statements were introduced, and they were damaging to the defense.  In light of the fact that the government's case was heavily dependent on Robles' taped conversations, we believe that, in these unusual circumstance, the testimony that he had a mental illness that led to \"verbosity,\" \"grandeza,\" and exaggeration was highly relevant and that an untrained layman would not be qualified to determine intelligently, and to the best degree the weight to place on Robles's recorded statements without enlightenment from Dr. Fumero.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that Dr. Fumero's testimony should be disallowed because the taped conversations featured current actions which were largely corroborated.  To the extent that Robles did suffer from the mental illness at issue, however, Dr. Fumero's testimony could be relevant to the credibility of current statements.  The defense theory is that Robles exaggerated his situation in statements that he made--a claim for which Dr. Fumero's testimony is clearly relevant.  That the statements were, in the view of the government, accurate, is something for the jury to consider in its deliberations.  It goes to the weight to be given to the evidence and is not a reason to exclude Dr. Fumero's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude, therefore, that the district court erred in refusing to allow Dr. Fumero to testify.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

The Transcripts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants also claim that transcripts provided by the government and used by the jury should not have been permitted.  The government provided transcripts of the taped conversations to the jury so that when the tape was played, the jury could follow along on the transcripts.  The transcripts included quotation marks around certain words that the government claimed were code words used to conceal the illegal nature of the conversations.  For example, quotation marks were placed around words such as \"ticket,\" which the government claimed referred to money, and \"accident,\" which allegedly referred to arrest.  Defendants' objection to these transcripts was overruled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This circuit allows the use of transcripts as a jury aid to tape recording playback.  See United States v. Carbone, 798 F.2d 21, 26 (1st Cir.1986).  Where transcripts are used, the judge should, as was done here, \"make clear [to the jury] that the tapes, not the transcript, constitute evidence in the case.\"  United States v. Richman, 600 F.2d 286, 295 (1st Cir.1979).  Furthermore, we have stated that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p>Even if transcripts are not admitted in evidence, in the sense of being marked as exhibits, they are read and relied on by the jury to follow the playback.  They should, therefore, be as accurate as possible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carbone, 798 F.2d at 27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The quotation marks used in the transcripts submitted to the jury in this case reflect the government's theory of the case.  The government does not claim that there is any audible emphasis or other vocal inflection placed on the marked words that is discernible when listening to the tape and failed, both at trial and on appeal, to offer any legitimate explanation for the quotation marks.  We hold that the trial court committed erred when it allowed the use of transcripts that contained quotation marks around certain words.  It is not enough that the court instructed the jury that only the tapes, and not the transcripts, were evidence.  Nor is it enough for the government to subsequently present evidence that the words were code words.  The government should not be allowed to bolster its argument by customizing the transcript to reflect its own theory of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Agents' Interpretation of the Transcript</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next claim advanced by appellants is that the court erred when it allowed FBI agents to interpret the recorded conversations.  Appellants' briefs fail to offer detailed descriptions of the incidents to which they object, although Gonzalez-Maldonado's brief cites to seventeen incidents that are generally alleged to represent occasions on which the agents' interpretations went beyond interpretation of code words.  Although appellants objected on certain occasions, they failed to object on many of the instances cited in Gonzalez-Maldonado's brief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although expert testimony is permitted in order to assist the jury in understanding \"code-like\" conversations in tape recordings, interpretations of clear conversations are not admissible.  See United States v. Montas, 41 F.3d 775, 783-84 (1st Cir.1994);  United States v. Lamattina, 889 F.2d 1191, 1194 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p>Expert testimony on a subject that is well within the bounds of a jury's ordinary experience generally has little probative value.  On the other hand, the risk of unfair prejudice is real.  By appearing to put the expert's stamp of approval on the government's theory, such testimony might unduly influence the jury's own assessment of the inference that is being urged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Montas, 41 F.3d at 784.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are conscious of the fact that the interpretation of alleged code-words used by the defendants in a complex case such as this may require the expert to make statements about the context in which those words are being used.  Nevertheless, we find that in some of the instances cited by appellants, the court erred by allowing FBI agents to comment on clear statements contained on the tapes.  Because we are reversing on other grounds, we need not review each alleged transgression.  Instead, we offer an example, in the hope that such errors can be avoided if there is another trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At one point Agent Plichta observed, in reference to one of the recordings, that the participants in a conversation \"appeared relieved when they--when they--when they discussed the fact that apparently they'd been able to make the delivery of money and nothing happened.  They were both relieved and I believe one of them even chuckles a bit about that.\"   Tr. 5 at 848.  That the speakers on the tape were, or were not, relieved is for the jury to determine, and the testimony of the agent does not assist them in this effort.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Spanish Definitions in Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant Montalvo claims that the district court erred in its instructions to the jury.  Specifically, he alleges that the court included in its definition of the term \"willfully\" a Spanish translation that is inaccurate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In delivering its instructions, the court stated the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The word \"knowingly,\" as that term has been used from time to time in these instructions, means that the act was done voluntarily and intentionally and not because of mistake or accident.  That is, \"knowingly\" means in Spanish a sabiendas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The word \"willfully\"--that is voluntariamente in Spanish--as that term has been used from time to time in these instructions, means that the act was committed voluntarily and purposely with the specific intent to do something the law forbids;  that is to say, with bad purpose either to disobey or disregard the law....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, unlawfully--in Spanish ilegalmente--means contrary to law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. 9 at 1704-05.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Montalvo argues that the term voluntariamente is equivalent to the English term \"voluntary\" and, therefore, represents only one aspect of willfulness.  As the English definition suggests, willfulness also requires that the act be committed purposely and with the intent to do something that the law forbids.  See United States v. Yefsky, 994 F.2d 885, 899 (1st Cir.1993).  We conclude that Montalvo is correct in his assertion that the term voluntariamente means \"voluntary.\"   See The Collins Spanish-English English-Spanish Dictionary (2d ed.1988).  It follows that the use of this term in order to assist jurors, whose predominant language may be Spanish, in understanding the term \"willfully\" was ill-advised.  We need not inquire into the question of whether it is reversible error, however, as we are reversing the judgment on other grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add the following note of caution.  Although we do not believe that there should be an absolute rule prohibiting the use of non-English words when instructing the jury, we do believe that this practice is inadvisable and should be discouraged.  The English meaning of the word \"willfully,\" for example, is adequately covered by an instruction such as those that have been approved by this court in the past.  See, e.g., United States v. Shadduck, 112 F.3d 523, 527-28 (1st Cir.1997);  Yefsky, 994 F.2d at 899.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  We therefore instruct the district courts to frame instructions in English.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. The Admission of Evidence</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Lottery Check</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the government admitted into evidence a photocopy of a 1992 lottery check seized from Montalvo at the time of his arrest.  The check was in the amount of $250,000.  The government introduced the evidence because Robles revealed to the undercover team that he had provided a winning lottery ticket in the amount of $250,000 to a friend of Papo who, the government claimed, was in the drug business.  That appellant possessed a check for the exact amount was, the government argued, probative of his involvement in the alleged conspiracy.  Furthermore, the government claims that the fact that the check was dated two years before the events described does not change the fact that it was relevant because Papo had worked with Robles for a long time and the check was offered to demonstrate the existence of a conspiracy long before the events of May through July 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant Montalvo claims that the check lacked relevance to the case.  He claims that \"[t]here was no evidence to show that the ticket had come from Robles, that it was purchased with the proceeds of drug transactions or that it evidenced Montalvo's involvement with Robles in drug distribution at some earlier time.\"   Brief of Appellant Montalvo, at 32.  In essence, appellant contends that there was nothing to indicate that the check was evidence of any element of any charged offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add that, at sentencing, the judge stated, \"I don't find a reasonable connection for this case to find by a preponderance of the evidence that the $250,000 lottery ticket that was purchased is part of this conspiracy, and therefore I am excluding it.\"   Transcript of Sentencing, at 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review this evidentiary ruling for abuse of discretion.  United States v. Brandon, 17 F.3d 409, 443-44 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the testimony fails to reveal any demonstrated connection between the photocopy of the check and the charges brought against defendants.  The check was from before the dates at issue in this case and no evidence was put forward to suggest that it was connected to drug transactions, except the general claim by the government that lottery checks were used to launder money.  The government argued at trial, however, that the check was relevant to demonstrate the existence of the conspiracy prior to the dates at issue.  Given our deferential standard of review, we, therefore, do not find abuse of discretion in this case.  Although we might conclude differently if our review were de novo, we do not believe that the court abused its discretion in accepting this argument.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Notebook Seized During Montalvo's Arrest</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant Montalvo also objects to the admission of a notebook seized at his home at the time of his arrest.  The government's expert witness, FBI Agent Carl Jensen, testified that \"[t]he submitted documents are in a format of records which could be maintained in connection with an illicit drug distribution business.\"   Tr. 7 at 1203.  Appellant argues that the notebook had no probative value because there was no indication as to when or by whom the notations had been made, there were no initials or names, no dollar signs or terminology attached to the numbers, and no correlation between the numbers in the notebook and the amounts involved in the offenses charged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review is, once again, on an abuse of discretion standard and we do not find such abuse here.  The government advanced the testimony of an expert witness who testified that the notebook appeared to be a record of drug transactions;  and that it \"lack[ed] the class characteristics [one] would expect to find with legitimate type business records,\" Tr. 228 at 1203-1204;  and that the apparent prices in the notebook were consistent with the prices of kilogram quantities of cocaine in central Florida, where appellant Montalvo lived during the time frame of these events.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this testimony, we do not find that the court abused its discretion in admitting the notebook into evidence.  The trial court was in a much better position than this court to assess the relevance of the notebook.  The decision to admit the notebook was within the sound discretion of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Notebook Seized from Robles</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant Montalvo next claims error in the admission of a notebook seized from Robles' home on the ground that it was not adequately authenticated as required by Federal Rules of Evidence 901.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  We review for abuse of discretion.

The Federal Rules of Evidence take a flexible approach to this issue.  The document's authenticity may be confirmed by \"[a]ppearance, contents, substance, internal patterns, or other distinctive characteristics, taken in conjunction with circumstances.\"  Id. The notebook was found, along with Robles' identification card, in a briefcase in Robles' room.  Such circumstantial evidence is permitted in order to authenticate the item.  Id. at 680.   We do not find that the district court abused its discretion in admitting this document into evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. Sufficiency of the Evidence Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants seek to have their convictions reversed and the case dismissed on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence, as a matter of law, to convict them.  In reviewing such a claim, we must determine if, \"after assaying all the evidence in the light most amiable to the government, and taking all reasonable inferences in its favor, a rational factfinder could find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the prosecution successfully proved the essential elements of the case.\"  United States v. O'Brien, 14 F.3d 703, 706 (1st Cir.1994).  \"[W]e do not pass on the credibility of the witnesses, nor do we demand that the government disprove every hypothesis consistent with the defendant's innocence.\"  United States v. Spinney, 65 F.3d 231, 234 (1st Cir.1995) (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to prove the conspiracy charge, the government was required to prove that appellants:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p>intended to agree and that they intended to commit the substantive criminal offense [distribution of cocaine] which was the object of their unlawful agreement.  Due to the clandestine nature of criminal conspiracies, the law recognizes that the illegal agreement may be either 'express or tacit' and that a 'common purpose and plan may be inferred from a development and collocation of circumstances.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v.

It was for the jury to determine whether these conversations related to legitimate business dealings or illegal drug transactions.  Viewing the evidence in the light most amiable to the government, we conclude that a reasonable jury could have concluded that the conversations in the tapes concerned drug related transactions.  With respect to Montalvo, the jury could also have inferred guilt from the notebooks and the lottery check put into evidence.  With respect to Gonzalez-Maldonado, evidence was presented that transactions took place at his place of business and a reasonable jury could have concluded that the taped conversations demonstrated his involvement in the conspiracy and the money laundering.  These conversations could be interpreted to have dealt with cocaine that had been damaged in shipment, cocaine stored at his place of business, and cocaine to be imported in the future.  Such inferences were permissible and, therefore, we find the sufficiency of the evidence claim to be without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI. Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, appellant Montalvo claims error in both the court's calculation of the quantity of drugs for which he should be held responsible and the court's role-in-the-offense determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we are remanding the case, we need not reach this issue.  In the event of a new trial, with different testimony and different arguments, the trial court will be in a better position than we are today to determine the quantity of drugs for which appellants, if convicted, should be held responsible, and to make an evaluation of defendants' role in the offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VII.

On that basis, the jury could have found the following facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the spring of 1993, the FBI began a money laundering investigation.  An undercover FBI agent, Agent Martn Suarez, and an informant infiltrated a money laundering organization that worked under the direction of a man known as \"Honcho.\"   Honcho communicated to Agent Suarez and the informant that they would be contacted through their pager, by a person using the code \"Romero 55.\"   On May 24, 1994, Agent Suarez received a page from Romero 55 and contacted him by phone.  Agent Suarez, the informant, and Romero 55--who was later identified as Julio Robles-Torres (\"Robles\")--arranged to meet the following day, at which time Romero 55 delivered approximately $600,000 to Agent Suarez and the informant.  The conversation that took place at the meeting was recorded, although there were periods when the recorder malfunctioned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the court admitted the taped conversation into evidence over the objection of defense counsel.  Agent Suarez testified that during the interrupted portion of the tape, Robles indicated that he had started an individual named \"Papo\" in \"this business\" and that Papo had made six million dollars.  Agent Suarez testified that, in the context of the conversation, he interpreted \"this business\" to mean the drug business.  The exchange between Agent Suarez and government counsel went as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>Agent Suarez:  I recall that he had mentioned that he had started Papo in this business.  He had--also mentioned that Papo was in the car repair business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>Government:  Okay.  When you say that he started--he, Robles, had started Papo in that business, what business is he talking about?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>Agent Suarez:  In the drug business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. 2 at 278.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the taped conversation, Robles also stated that he had given a lottery ticket in the amount of $250,000 to a friend of Papo.  Agent Suarez testified that drug smugglers buy winning lottery tickets in order to launder money.  There was no mention of Montalvo or Gonzalez-Maldonado during the taped conversation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the delivery of $600,000 and the conversation between Agent Suarez and Robles, the government obtained a court order authorizing the interception of communications on Robles' cellular phone.  At trial, the government introduced more than sixty of these intercepted calls.  The government states that in fifteen of those calls, appellant Montalvo, identified as \"Ito,\" spoke with Robles;  and in ten calls, Gonzalez-Maldonado, identified as \"Nori,\" spoke with Robles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 27, 1994, FBI Special Agent Daniel Gonzalez intercepted a conversation between Robles and Papo.  During that conversation, Robles and Papo referred to \"tickets.\"   Agent Gonzalez, over objection, testified that the word \"ticket\" referred to money.  Neither appellant participated in or was mentioned during the call.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 28, 1994, six conversations were intercepted by police.  The jury could have concluded that appellant Montalvo participated in one of these calls.  The first call was to appellant Gonzalez-Maldonado at his store, Mazda Fever.  Gonzalez-Maldonado indicated that he had four tickets, and Robles said that they could combine their tickets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on these calls, another FBI Special Agent, Michael Plichta, set up surveillance at Mazda Fever.  He observed Robles arrive in a gray Volvo around 4:00 p.m., on June 28, meet briefly with an unidentified male, and then drive around back, where he remained, out of sight, for twenty minutes.  At 4:20 p.m., an individual identified only as \"Chepe\" called Robles, who stated that he was picking up the tickets at that moment and that he would proceed to deliver them.  When Robles departed, he was followed to a Ponderosa restaurant, where he met briefly with two men.  Shortly thereafter, the two men were detained and $715,309 was seized from a suitcase and a cardboard box found in their car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following day, Papo and Robles had three telephone conversations about the seizure, including the question of who would assume responsibility for the lost money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In recorded conversations on July 8, 1994, Robles confirmed with Montalvo and an individual identified as \"Gurucho\" that Gonzalez-Maldonado had all the tickets.  In his conversation with Gurucho, Robles indicated that Gurucho should contact Gonzalez-Maldonado about a delivery.  Gonzalez informed Robles that Gurucho had directed them to make a delivery to an individual identified as \"Nina\" at the Condado Plaza Hotel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 9, 1994, the FBI established surveillance at the Condado Plaza Hotel.  FBI Special Agent Jane Peltier testified that Robles went to Mazda Fever around 8:30 a.m.  Shortly after, he left Mazda Fever and proceeded to the Condado Plaza Hotel parking garage, arriving around 9:00 a.m.  Carrying a gray bag, he went to the eighth floor, and then left the hotel empty-handed.  FBI agents entered room 825 and recovered the gray bag and seized $243,600 from the safe in the room.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of Montalvo's arrest, police seized, among other things, a photocopy of a Puerto Rico lottery check, two pagers, and two notebooks.  In addition to Montalvo and Gonzalez-Maldonado, the police arrested Robles.  The three were to be tried together until, in March 1995, Robles was found incompetent to stand trial and the case against him was severed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants assert several claims on appeal.  We find some of those claims valid, warranting reversal of the convictions.  In order to give as much guidance as possible to the district court, we also discuss some of the other claims that are likely to resurface if there is a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>I. The Psychiatric Testimony of Dr. Jose Fumero</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants argue that the district court erred in excluding the testimony of Dr. Fumero, the psychiatrist who had, at the court's direction, initially examined Robles for competency.  This claim includes two distinct arguments.  First, appellants claim that the court erred in excluding Dr. Fumero's testimony after defense counsel had relied on an earlier ruling that the testimony would be allowed.  Second, appellants assert that the court's decision to exclude Fumero's testimony was based on the mistaken belief that the testimony was offered only to address the issue of Robles' competency as a witness.  Appellants contend that the testimony was actually offered to:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>provide information concerning Robles' medical history and his diagnosed schizophrenia, and the possible ramifications of Robles' illness for evaluation of the evidence to be introduced at trial--to provide information relevant to whether, as a result of his mental disease or defect Robles was unable to appreciate the nature and quality or wrongfulness of his acts in May-June, 1994;  or whether aspects of his illness were relevant to assessing the reliability and meaning of Robles' statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Brief of Appellant Montalvo, at 17.  We deal with each claim in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Opening Statements</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to trial, defense counsel met with Dr. Fumero, who had conducted the competency examination of Robles.  Fumero opined that Robles was suffering from a mental illness at the time of the offenses and that his mental illness resulted in a tendency to exaggerate.  Defense counsel informed the court that he intended to have Fumero testify at trial, arguing that Fumero's testimony should be admitted so that the jury could determine the weight to be given to the taped conversations.  Tr. 1 at 7. The court stated that it would \"let Dr. Fumero testify and then let that go to the jury.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Tr. 1 at 21.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During opening statements, counsel for both defendants made reference to Robles' mental state.  Counsel for Gonzalez-Maldonado promised the jury that he would produce a psychiatrist who would testify that a person in Robles' condition \"exaggerates, and that everything that he talks about is greater.\"   Tr. 1 at 163.  Counsel for Montalvo, in his opening statement, stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>The expert selected by this Court, Dr. Fumero, selected by this Court, will come here, will sit there and will testify that during this conspiracy ... Mr. Julio Robles-Torres was mentally insane.  Therefore, you cannot trust him.  You cannot put much attention to what he's saying because he exaggerates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. 1 at 169.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the presentation of defendants' case, the court reconsidered its earlier decision and decided that Dr. Fumero would not be allowed to testify because the testimony would only go to the issue of Robles' competency as a witness, which is a question for the court, and that evidence of a mental defect does not render testimony inadmissible.  See Tr. 8 at 1506.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants argue that even if Fumero's testimony was properly excluded, the court committed reversible error by first ruling that it would permit Fumero to testify and then, after the close of the government's case, ruling that his testimony would be excluded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Anderson v. Butler, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"512374\"><a href=\"/opinion/512374/bruce-anderson-v-norman-butler/\"><span class=\"volume\">858</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1988), defense counsel, in his opening, told the jury that he would call a psychiatrist and a psychologist to show that the defendant had no appreciation of what he had done.  Counsel subsequently rested his case without calling the promised doctors, although they were available.  On appeal, this court held that the failure to call these witnesses amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel, stating that \"little is more damaging than to fail to produce important evidence that had been promised in an opening.\"  Id. at 17.  \"The first thing the ultimately disappointed jurors would believe, in the absence of some other explanation, would be that the doctors were unwilling, viz., unable, to live up to their billing.  This they would not forget.\"  Id. \"[T]he jurors' conclusion would remain that impartial experts--the most qualified witnesses--would not testify as counsel had said they would;  in effect a contradiction of the favorable lay witnesses, much worse than if he had not mentioned the doctors initially.\"  Id. Furthermore, \"to promise even a condensed recital of such powerful evidence, and then not produce it, could not be disregarded as harmless.  We find it prejudicial as a matter of law.\"  Id. at 19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case at bar raises similar concerns.  The opening statements for the defense included a promise to the jury that a psychiatrist would testify to the effect that Robles exaggerates as a result of his mental illness.  Unlike in Anderson, it was the district court that prevented the defense from fulfilling its promise to the jury.  Having obtained the assurance of the court that Dr. Fumero would be allowed to testify, defense counsel stated as much to the jury.  When the court later changed its mind and ruled that the expert would not be permitted to testify, defendants were unable to produce the promised testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the jury in Anderson, the jury in this case was likely to infer from defense counsel's failure to call Dr. Fumero that he was unwilling to testify for the defense.  Nor was the jury informed of the fact that it was the court's ruling, rather than the defendants' decision, that kept Dr. Fumero off the stand.  Although Anderson concerned an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the principle behind Anderson applies in this case.  A defendant's opening statement prepares the jury to hear his case.  If the defense fails to produce promised expert testimony that is critical to the defense strategy, a danger arises that the jury will presume that the expert is unwilling to testify and the defense is flawed.  That the defendant should suffer this presumption because he relied on a prior ruling of the trial court that the same court later reversed, rather than because of poor judgment on the part of his own counsel, in no way changes the fact that the presumption formed in the minds of the jury is prejudicial.  As we did in Anderson, we find that promising to admit this important evidence and then failing to produce it is prejudicial as a matter of law in the circumstances of this case.  Following Anderson, therefore, we find that denying defendants the opportunity to have Dr. Fumero testify, in light of the fact that the court's decision on the matter led defense counsel, in their opening remarks, to promise the expert's testimony to the jury, was reversible error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Admissibility of Dr. Fumero's Testimony</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants also challenge the district court's ruling that Dr. Fumero's testimony is inadmissible.  On appellate review, \"[a] district court's decision to admit or exclude expert testimony is entitled to great deference.\"  United States v. Shay, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196160\"><a href=\"/opinion/196160/united-states-v-shay/\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></a></span>, 132 (1st Cir.1995).  We will reverse the trial court's decision on this question only if \"(1) the district court based the decision on an incorrect legal standard, or (2) we have a 'definite and firm conviction that the court made a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached based on a weighing of the relevant factors.' \"  Id. (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants' argument proceeds as follows.  Dr. Fumero was a qualified witness within the meaning of Federal Rule of Evidence 702, as the court agreed.  Tr. 8 at 1483.  He proffered to the court that the symptoms of Robles' mental condition include \"verbosity;\" \"grandeza\" (\"[h]e has to feel important and the center of attention as part of his ... fragmented ego needs\"), Tr. 8 at 1497;  and exaggeration.  Because defendants faced criminal charges based largely on recorded conversations involving Robles, and because the government claimed that these conversations demonstrated the existence of a drug conspiracy, the weight placed on the taped conversations by the jury was of paramount importance.  Indeed, the defendants' case was founded on the view that the recorded conversations were discussions of legitimate business dealings.  If the jury could be convinced that Robles' testimony was unreliable because he had a medical condition that led him to exaggerate, it would be more likely to believe the defense theory that they were involved in legal business activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled that Dr. Fumero would not be allowed to testify on the ground that \"the fact that a person may suffer a mental defect or problem does not render his testimony inadmissible.\"   Tr. 8 at 1459.  The court stated further that \"[y]ou cannot bring a witness and say, well, this man is not telling the truth or he can't tell the truth.\"   Tr. 8 at 1465.  The court appears to have understood Dr. Fumero's testimony to be related to the competency of Robles:  \"What I suggest to you is that we give to the jury a stipulation that Julio Robles had been held not competent to stand trial at this time but that he is being evaluated further.\"   Tr. 8 at 1466.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well established that a witness' mental state can be relevant to the issue of the witness' credibility.  United States v. Butt, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577004\"><a href=\"/opinion/577004/united-states-v-herbert-alan-butt-aka-alan-butt-united-states-v-james/\"><span class=\"volume\">955</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span>, 82 (1st Cir.1992).  The competency of a witness to testify is a determination to be made by the trial judge, but issues of credibility are for the trier of fact.  See United States v. Carroll, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"734111\"><a href=\"/opinion/734111/united-states-v-christopher-b-carroll/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">740</span></a></span>, 743 (1st Cir.1997);  United States v.

On the other hand, \"no constitutional provision, law, or rule requires the exclusion of expert testimony simply because it concerns a credibility question.\"  Id. To be admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 702, a proposed expert witness must:  (1) be qualified to testify as an expert by \"knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education,\" Fed.R.Evid. 702;  (2) the testimony must concern \"scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge,\" Fed.R.Evid. 702;  and (3) the testimony must \"assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\"  Fed.R.Evid. 702.

Shortly after the bombing, he told a police officer that \"he was sorry about it and wished he could turn back the hands of time.\"  Id. The government argued that this statement was evidence of Shay Jr.'s guilt.  As part of his defense, Shay Jr. sought to call Dr. Phillips, a psychiatrist, to testify that Shay Jr. suffered from a mental disorder known as \"pseudologa fantastica.\"   The expert witness was to testify that this illness caused Shay Jr. to fabricate self-aggrandizing lies that would place him at the center of attention.  Id. at 129-30.   The district court excluded this testimony on the ground that the jury was capable of determining the reliability of Shay Jr.'s statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Shay panel held that expert psychiatric testimony can be admitted in appropriate circumstances to establish a witness' \"character for truthfulness.\"  Id. at 131.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The instant case is governed by Shay, and our analysis follows the one adopted there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither party challenges Dr. Fumero's qualifications as an expert.  The proffered testimony concerned the mental illness of Robles and its impact on his behavior--implying that it concerned \"scientific, technical or specialized knowledge.\"   The remaining question is whether it would have assisted the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.  The question that a court must answer in determining whether a proposed expert's testimony will assist the trier of fact is \"whether the untrained layman would be qualified to determine intelligently and to the best degree, the particular issue without enlightenment from those having a special understanding of the subject matter involved.\"  Id. at 132 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Dr. Fumero's testimony would have discussed Robles' mental illness.  Dr. Fumero would have testified that Robles, as a result of his illness, was prone to exaggeration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, this case has a unique dimension.  Because Robles was incompetent to testify, the jury did not have the usual chance to evaluate his demeanor.  Yet, the tapes containing his statements were introduced, and they were damaging to the defense.  In light of the fact that the government's case was heavily dependent on Robles' taped conversations, we believe that, in these unusual circumstance, the testimony that he had a mental illness that led to \"verbosity,\" \"grandeza,\" and exaggeration was highly relevant and that an untrained layman would not be qualified to determine intelligently, and to the best degree the weight to place on Robles's recorded statements without enlightenment from Dr. Fumero.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that Dr. Fumero's testimony should be disallowed because the taped conversations featured current actions which were largely corroborated.  To the extent that Robles did suffer from the mental illness at issue, however, Dr. Fumero's testimony could be relevant to the credibility of current statements.  The defense theory is that Robles exaggerated his situation in statements that he made--a claim for which Dr. Fumero's testimony is clearly relevant.  That the statements were, in the view of the government, accurate, is something for the jury to consider in its deliberations.  It goes to the weight to be given to the evidence and is not a reason to exclude Dr. Fumero's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude, therefore, that the district court erred in refusing to allow Dr. Fumero to testify.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

The transcripts included quotation marks around certain words that the government claimed were code words used to conceal the illegal nature of the conversations.  For example, quotation marks were placed around words such as \"ticket,\" which the government claimed referred to money, and \"accident,\" which allegedly referred to arrest.

The government does not claim that there is any audible emphasis or other vocal inflection placed on the marked words that is discernible when listening to the tape and failed, both at trial and on appeal, to offer any legitimate explanation for the quotation marks.  We hold that the trial court committed erred when it allowed the use of transcripts that contained quotation marks around certain words.  It is not enough that the court instructed the jury that only the tapes, and not the transcripts, were evidence.  Nor is it enough for the government to subsequently present evidence that the words were code words.  The government should not be allowed to bolster its argument by customizing the transcript to reflect its own theory of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Agents' Interpretation of the Transcript</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next claim advanced by appellants is that the court erred when it allowed FBI agents to interpret the recorded conversations.  Appellants' briefs fail to offer detailed descriptions of the incidents to which they object, although Gonzalez-Maldonado's brief cites to seventeen incidents that are generally alleged to represent occasions on which the agents' interpretations went beyond interpretation of code words.  Although appellants objected on certain occasions, they failed to object on many of the instances cited in Gonzalez-Maldonado's brief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although expert testimony is permitted in order to assist the jury in understanding \"code-like\" conversations in tape recordings, interpretations of clear conversations are not admissible.  See United States v. Montas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195767\"><a href=\"/opinion/195767/united-states-v-felix-montas/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">775</span></a></span>, 783-84 (1st Cir.1994);  United States v.

On the other hand, the risk of unfair prejudice is real.  By appearing to put the expert's stamp of approval on the government's theory, such testimony might unduly influence the jury's own assessment of the inference that is being urged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Montas, 41 F.3d at 784.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are conscious of the fact that the interpretation of alleged code-words used by the defendants in a complex case such as this may require the expert to make statements about the context in which those words are being used.  Nevertheless, we find that in some of the instances cited by appellants, the court erred by allowing FBI agents to comment on clear statements contained on the tapes.  Because we are reversing on other grounds, we need not review each alleged transgression.  Instead, we offer an example, in the hope that such errors can be avoided if there is another trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At one point Agent Plichta observed, in reference to one of the recordings, that the participants in a conversation \"appeared relieved when they--when they--when they discussed the fact that apparently they'd been able to make the delivery of money and nothing happened.  They were both relieved and I believe one of them even chuckles a bit about that.\"   Tr. 5 at 848.  That the speakers on the tape were, or were not, relieved is for the jury to determine, and the testimony of the agent does not assist them in this effort.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Spanish Definitions in Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant Montalvo claims that the district court erred in its instructions to the jury.  Specifically, he alleges that the court included in its definition of the term \"willfully\" a Spanish translation that is inaccurate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In delivering its instructions, the court stated the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The word \"knowingly,\" as that term has been used from time to time in these instructions, means that the act was done voluntarily and intentionally and not because of mistake or accident.  That is, \"knowingly\" means in Spanish a sabiendas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The word \"willfully\"--that is voluntariamente in Spanish--as that term has been used from time to time in these instructions, means that the act was committed voluntarily and purposely with the specific intent to do something the law forbids;  that is to say, with bad purpose either to disobey or disregard the law....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, unlawfully--in Spanish ilegalmente--means contrary to law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. 9 at 1704-05.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Montalvo argues that the term voluntariamente is equivalent to the English term \"voluntary\" and, therefore, represents only one aspect of willfulness.  As the English definition suggests, willfulness also requires that the act be committed purposely and with the intent to do something that the law forbids.  See United States v. Yefsky, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608076\"><a href=\"/opinion/608076/united-states-v-sheldon-arthur-yefsky/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">885</span></a></span>, 899 (1st Cir.1993).  We conclude that Montalvo is correct in his assertion that the term voluntariamente means \"voluntary.\"   See The Collins Spanish-English English-Spanish Dictionary (2d ed.1988).  It follows that the use of this term in order to assist jurors, whose predominant language may be Spanish, in understanding the term \"willfully\" was ill-advised.  We need not inquire into the question of whether it is reversible error, however, as we are reversing the judgment on other grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add the following note of caution.  Although we do not believe that there should be an absolute rule prohibiting the use of non-English words when instructing the jury, we do believe that this practice is inadvisable and should be discouraged.  The English meaning of the word \"willfully,\" for example, is adequately covered by an instruction such as those that have been approved by this court in the past.  See, e.g., United States v. Shadduck, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"740224\"><a href=\"/opinion/740224/37-collier-bankrcas2d-1667-bankr-l-rep-p-77350-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">523</span></a></span>, 527-28 (1st Cir.1997);  Yefsky, 994 F.2d at 899.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  We therefore instruct the district courts to frame instructions in English.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. The Admission of Evidence</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Lottery Check</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the government admitted into evidence a photocopy of a 1992 lottery check seized from Montalvo at the time of his arrest.  The check was in the amount of $250,000.  The government introduced the evidence because Robles revealed to the undercover team that he had provided a winning lottery ticket in the amount of $250,000 to a friend of Papo who, the government claimed, was in the drug business.  That appellant possessed a check for the exact amount was, the government argued, probative of his involvement in the alleged conspiracy.  Furthermore, the government claims that the fact that the check was dated two years before the events described does not change the fact that it was relevant because Papo had worked with Robles for a long time and the check was offered to demonstrate the existence of a conspiracy long before the events of May through July 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant Montalvo claims that the check lacked relevance to the case.  He claims that \"[t]here was no evidence to show that the ticket had come from Robles, that it was purchased with the proceeds of drug transactions or that it evidenced Montalvo's involvement with Robles in drug distribution at some earlier time.\"   Brief of Appellant Montalvo, at 32.  In essence, appellant contends that there was nothing to indicate that the check was evidence of any element of any charged offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add that, at sentencing, the judge stated, \"I don't find a reasonable connection for this case to find by a preponderance of the evidence that the $250,000 lottery ticket that was purchased is part of this conspiracy, and therefore I am excluding it.\"   Transcript of Sentencing, at 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review this evidentiary ruling for abuse of discretion.  United States v. Brandon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"664045\"><a href=\"/opinion/664045/united-states-v-peter-brandon-united-states-of-america-v-charles-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></a></span>, 443-44 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the testimony fails to reveal any demonstrated connection between the photocopy of the check and the charges brought against defendants.  The check was from before the dates at issue in this case and no evidence was put forward to suggest that it was connected to drug transactions, except the general claim by the government that lottery checks were used to launder money.  The government argued at trial, however, that the check was relevant to demonstrate the existence of the conspiracy prior to the dates at issue.  Given our deferential standard of review, we, therefore, do not find abuse of discretion in this case.  Although we might conclude differently if our review were de novo, we do not believe that the court abused its discretion in accepting this argument.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Notebook Seized During Montalvo's Arrest</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant Montalvo also objects to the admission of a notebook seized at his home at the time of his arrest.  The government's expert witness, FBI Agent Carl Jensen, testified that \"[t]he submitted documents are in a format of records which could be maintained in connection with an illicit drug distribution business.\"   Tr. 7 at 1203.  Appellant argues that the notebook had no probative value because there was no indication as to when or by whom the notations had been made, there were no initials or names, no dollar signs or terminology attached to the numbers, and no correlation between the numbers in the notebook and the amounts involved in the offenses charged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review is, once again, on an abuse of discretion standard and we do not find such abuse here.  The government advanced the testimony of an expert witness who testified that the notebook appeared to be a record of drug transactions;  and that it \"lack[ed] the class characteristics [one] would expect to find with legitimate type business records,\" Tr. 228 at 1203-1204;  and that the apparent prices in the notebook were consistent with the prices of kilogram quantities of cocaine in central Florida, where appellant Montalvo lived during the time frame of these events.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this testimony, we do not find that the court abused its discretion in admitting the notebook into evidence.  The trial court was in a much better position than this court to assess the relevance of the notebook.  The decision to admit the notebook was within the sound discretion of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Notebook Seized from Robles</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant Montalvo next claims error in the admission of a notebook seized from Robles' home on the ground that it was not adequately authenticated as required by Federal Rules of Evidence 901.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  We review for abuse of discretion.

Viewing the evidence in the light most amiable to the government, we conclude that a reasonable jury could have concluded that the conversations in the tapes concerned drug related transactions.  With respect to Montalvo, the jury could also have inferred guilt from the notebooks and the lottery check put into evidence.  With respect to Gonzalez-Maldonado, evidence was presented that transactions took place at his place of business and a reasonable jury could have concluded that the taped conversations demonstrated his involvement in the conspiracy and the money laundering.  These conversations could be interpreted to have dealt with cocaine that had been damaged in shipment, cocaine stored at his place of business, and cocaine to be imported in the future.  Such inferences were permissible and, therefore, we find the sufficiency of the evidence claim to be without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI.
