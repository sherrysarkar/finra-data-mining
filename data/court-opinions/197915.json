Juan M. Perez-Gimenez, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n               Selya and Stahl, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\nTeodoro Mendez Lebron on brief for appellant.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                       April 22, 1998\r\n                                         \r\n\n  Per Curiam.  Upon independent review of the portions of\r\nthe appellate record provided to us, and with due deference to\r\nthe district court's findings of fact, see United States v.\r\nTortora, 922 F.2d 880, 882 (1st Cir. 1990), we conclude that\r\nthe pre-trial detention order should not be disturbed.  \r\n     Specifically, it appears that the government sustained\r\nits burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that\r\ndefendant poses such a substantial flight risk that no\r\nconditions will reasonably assure his appearance at trial.  SeeUnited States v. Dillon, 938 F.2d 1412, 1417 (1st Cir. 1991). \r\nDefendant's rebuttal evidence, including his family and\r\ncommunity ties, must be weighed along with the presumption\r\narising under 18 U.S.C.  3142(e) and the other factors listed\r\nin  3142(g).  In our view, that rebuttal evidence did not\r\noutweigh the statutory presumption, the information regarding\r\ndefendant's role in importing an exceptionally large quantity\r\nof drugs, and the risk that defendant will flee to avoid a long\r\nterm of imprisonment.  See United States v. Palmer-Contreras,\r\n835 F.2d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 1987).  The district court was not\r\nrequired to give that rebuttal evidence more weight or to\r\nexplain further its rejection of the proposed conditions of\r\nrelease.  Accordingly, we do not conclude that the district\r\ncourt should have reached a different result.  See Tortora, 922\r\nF.2d at 883.\r\n    Because we conclude that the detention was justified based\r\non risk of flight, we need not consider whether it also was\r\njustified based on dangerousness.  See Dillon, 938 F.2d at\r\n1417.\r\n    We also reject defendant's argument that he is entitled to\r\nrelease due to the district court's delay in ruling on his\r\nmotion.  See United States v. Montalvo-Murillo, 495 U.S. 711,\r\n716-17 (1990) (\"Neither the timing requirements nor any other\r\npart of the [Bail Reform] Act can be read to require, or even\r\nsuggest, that a timing error must result in release of a person\r\nwho should otherwise be detained.\").  \r\n    Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
