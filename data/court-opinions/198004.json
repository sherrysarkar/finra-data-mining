Jose Antonio Fuste, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                   Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n            Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n               and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n Jorge L. Arroyo-Alejandro on brief for appellant.\r\n Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Warren Vazquez and\r\nNelson J. Perez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorneys, on brief\r\nfor appellee.\r\n\nJune 11, 1998\r\n\n        Per Curiam.  Jairo Nagupe-Palacio appeals from his\r\nsentence imposed following his guilty plea to conspiring to\r\nimport more than 1,000 kilograms of marihuana into the United\r\nStates from Colombia.  Appellant challenges the district\r\ncourt's two-level increase in his base offense level pursuant\r\nto U.S.S.G.  2D1.1(b)(2)(B).  Specifically, appellant argues\r\nthat the record does not contain sufficient support for the\r\ndistrict court's finding that he acted as \"captain\" of the boat\r\nused to import the marihuana.\r\n          This court \"review[s] the sentencing court's . . .\r\nfactual conclusions, which must be supported by a preponderance\r\nof the evidence, for clear error.\"  United States v. Grant, 114\r\nF.3d 323, 328 (1st Cir. 1997).  \"Fed.R.Crim.P. 32 allows the\r\n[sentencing] court to adopt the facts set forth in the\r\npresentence report '[e]xcept for any unresolved objection'\r\nnoted in the addendum submitted by the probation officer as\r\nrequired by the rule.\"  United States v. Van, 87 F.3d 1, 3 (1st\r\nCir. 1996).  Appellant concedes that he failed to object to the\r\nPSR's description of the offense conduct, including its\r\ncharacterization of him as \"captain\" of the vessel. \r\n          As the district court adopted the factual findings of\r\nthe PSR, this court reviews the district court's findings in\r\nlight of the facts contained in the PSR.  See Grant, 114 F.3d\r\nat 328.  According to the PSR, Nagupe stated in an interview\r\nwith a probation officer that he had agreed to captain the boat\r\nbecause he was unemployed and needed the money.  He admitted\r\nthat he had captained the boat and that the other crew members\r\nhad assisted him.  This information in the PSR, to which no\r\nobjection was made, was sufficient to support the sentencing\r\ncourt's finding that appellant acted as the captain of the\r\nboat.\r\n          Appellant's argument that the record lacked\r\nsufficient information about the types of skills required to\r\ncaptain the particular vessel, is misplaced.  See United Statesv. Guerrero, 114 F.3d 332, 346 (1st Cir. 1997) (rejecting\r\ndefendant's argument that he was not a \"pilot\" under \r\n2D1.1(b)(2)(B) because he lacked special navigational skills). \r\nAn increase is warranted under  2D1.1(b)(2)(B) upon a finding\r\nthat the defendant \"acted as . . . a captain . . . aboard any\r\n. . . vessel carrying a controlled substance.\"  No specific\r\nfinding that special skills were needed or employed is\r\nrequired. Compare U.S.S.G.  3B1.3 (providing for role-in-the-\r\noffense adjustment where defendant \"used a special skill\").\r\n          Appellant's sentence is affirmed.  See Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
