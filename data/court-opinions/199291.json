MAUSER,\n              Plaintiff, Appellant/Cross-Appellee,\n\n                               v.\n\n    RAYTHEON COMPANY PENSION PLAN FOR SALARIED EMPLOYEES;\n                       RAYTHEON COMPANY,\n            Defendants, Appellees/Cross-Appellant.\n\n\n        APPEALS FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n         [Hon. William J. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n       [Hon. Reginald C.

Mauser appeals from the district\n\ncourt’s summary judgment for Raytheon Company Pension Plan for\n\nSalaried Employees and Raytheon Company (together, Raytheon) as to\n\nhis claims that (1) Raytheon arbitrarily and capriciously denied him\n\npension benefits; (2) Raytheon should be estopped from denying him\n\nbenefits; and (3) Raytheon violated its fiduciary obligations under\n\nthe Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1001 et seq.    Mauser also contests the remedy and\n\nattorneys’ fees awarded by the district court after trial on his\n\nfourth claim, which alleged that he detrimentally relied on a\n\nmisleading summary plan description.      Finally, Mauser asserts that\n\nthe district court abused its discretion when, after trial, it did\n\nnot allow Mauser to amend his complaint in order to bring a claim for\n\nstatutory penalties under ERISA.      In its cross-appeal, Raytheon\n\nargues that the district court erred in denying Raytheon’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment as to Mauser’s claim of reliance on an inadequate\n\nsummary plan description and in holding against Raytheon on that\n\nclaim at trial.    The district court had jurisdiction under 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1132(e) and 28 U.S.C. § 1331.      We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1291.    We affirm in part and reverse in part.\n\n                                I\n\n\n\n                               -2-\n\f         Mauser’s first stint of employment for Raytheon began in\n\nSeptember 1966 and ended on February 29, 1980.     During this period,\n\nMauser became completely vested in Raytheon’s contributory defined\n\nbenefit plan, which, at that time, calculated benefits using a\n\nparticipant’s career average salary.     After Mauser left Raytheon in\n\n1980, he received a letter explaining his pension benefit: at age 65,\n\nhe would receive $453.17 per month or, if he withdrew his\n\ncontributions, $243.09 per month.   Mauser withdrew his contributions\n\nby an application dated August 30, 1982.\n\n         Effective January 1, 1981, Raytheon made its plan non-\n\ncontributory and changed its benefits formula to one based on a\n\nparticipant’s final average salary, thereby significantly increasing\n\nretirement benefits for eligible employees.     The plan was renamed\n\n“Raytheon Company Pension Plan for Salaried Employees” (Plan).      Under\n\nthe terms of the Plan, the new formula did not apply to Mauser\n\nbecause he was not an active employee on December 31, 1980, and did\n\nnot fall within one of the exceptions.\n\n         During 1987, Mauser learned from current and former\n\nRaytheon employees of the favorable change to Raytheon’s pension\n\nbenefit formula.   With this information in mind, Mauser states that\n\nhe turned down a job at Westinghouse Company during February 1988,\n\nand in April 1988 he applied to Raytheon.     Upon his re-hire at\n\nRaytheon, he received a copy of the current summary plan description\n\n\n                              -3-\n\f(Plan Summary) which contained the following section:\n\n    If you leave Raytheon and later return\n    . . . .\n    [I]f you leave the company and are away longer than 12\n    months, you won’t receive credit for the time you were\n    away.       Whether the service you had before you left will be\n    counted depends on whether or not you were vested when you\n    left, and on the length of time you were gone.\n           It will be counted when you have completed a year of\n    service after you return if any of the following applies:\n           1.     You were vested when you left\n           2.     Your time away is less than the service you had\n                  before you left\n           3.     You left after 1/1/85, and your time away is\n                  less than five years.\n\n\nThe district court found that Mauser read this statement and believed\n\nthat his pre-1981 years of service would be taken into account when\n\nhis pension was calculated under the new, final average salary\n\nformula.\n\n           Mauser asserts that in reliance on his reading of the Plan\n\nSummary, he “rejected a more lucrative offer of employment with\n\nWestinghouse Company, made improvements on his home, provided his\n\ndaughter a lavish wedding, did not make alternate or additional\n\nretirement income plans, agreed his wife did not need to obtain\n\nemployment with a promise of future pension benefits, and remained in\n\nthe employ of Raytheon.\"\n\n                                    -4-\n\f            In 1990, Mauser received a personal statement of benefits\n\nfrom Raytheon; he realized that it did not include any credit for his\n\npre-1981 years of service.    Mauser orally requested a corrected\n\nstatement, which he did not receive.     However, Mauser did not make\n\nclear to Raytheon his belief that his prior years of service would be\n\nincluded in calculating his benefits.     The benefits statements from\n\n1991 through 1994 all failed to include credit for pre-1981 service,\n\nand Mauser continued, unsuccessfully, to make verbal requests for a\n\ncorrected statement.    Beginning in November of 1994, Mauser made a\n\nmore intense, written effort to ascertain the scope of his benefits.\n\nEarly in 1995 Raytheon informed Mauser that his pre-1981 years of\n\nservice would not be used in calculating his pension.      Mauser then\n\nhired an attorney and has consistently maintained that he is entitled\n\nto a calculation of benefits under the new formula that takes into\n\naccount both his first and second periods of employment with\n\nRaytheon.\n\n            Mauser brought four claims against Raytheon.   First, he\n\nalleged that Raytheon’s administration of benefits was arbitrary and\n\ncapricious because Raytheon had granted credit to one employee for\n\nhis pre-1981 years of service.    (This claim also included\n\nallegations, not raised on appeal, that Raytheon had arbitrarily and\n\ncapriciously misinterpreted the Plan.)     Next, Mauser alleged that\n\nRaytheon should be estopped from denying him credit for his pre-1981\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fyears of service because Raytheon had purposefully misrepresented its\n\nposition regarding break-in-service employees (estoppel claim).     In\n\naddition, Mauser’s complaint asserted that Raytheon’s actions\n\namounted to a breach of its fiduciary duty under ERISA (fiduciary\n\nduty claim).   These three claims — capricious denial, estoppel, and\n\nfiduciary duty — were resolved in Raytheon’s favor on its motion for\n\nsummary judgment.   See Mauser v. Raytheon Co. Pension Plan for\n\nSalaried Employees, 31 F.Supp.2d 168 (D. Mass. 1998).\n\n           A bench trial was held on Mauser’s final claim that\n\nRaytheon’s Plan Summary violated ERISA’s disclosure requirements.\n\nThe district court concluded that the Plan Summary was inadequate and\n\nthat there was “some” “thin” reliance.   It held that Mauser would be\n\nallowed to redeposit his withdrawn contributions; however, the new\n\nformula would not be applied to include the pre-1981 years of\n\nservice.   Mauser requested attorneys’ fees in the amount of $156,201,\n\nbut the court, after taking into account various factors, awarded\n\nonly $35,000 in fees.   After trial, Mauser asked the district court\n\nto allow him to amend his complaint to include a claim for statutory\n\npenalties against Raytheon for refusing to provide benefit\n\ninformation in violation of 29 U.S.C. §1132(c).   The district court\n\ndenied this request to amend.\n\n                                II\n\n           At the heart of this appeal is Mauser’s claim that\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fRaytheon is bound by the Plan Summary to credit his pre-1981 years of\n\nservice under its favorable, final average salary formula.     One of\n\nERISA’s civil enforcement provisions provides that a participant may\n\nbring an action “(A) to enjoin any act or practice which violates any\n\nprovision of this subchapter . . . or (B) to obtain other appropriate\n\nequitable relief (i) to redress such violations or (ii) to enforce\n\nany provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan.”     29\n\nU.S.C. § 1132(a)(3).   Mauser asserts that he is entitled to “other\n\nappropriate equitable relief” because the Plan Summary violated\n\nERISA’s disclosure provision, which provides:\n\n\n\n    (a) A summary plan description of any employee benefit\n    plan shall be furnished to participants and beneficiaries\n    . . . . The summary plan description shall include the\n    information described in subsection (b) of this section,\n    shall be written in a manner calculated to be understood\n    by the average plan participant, and shall be sufficiently\n    accurate and comprehensive to reasonably apprise such\n    participants and beneficiaries of their rights and\n    obligations under the plan. . . .\n\n\n    (b) The summary plan description shall contain the\n    following information: . . . the plan's requirements\n    respecting eligibility for participation and benefits; . .\n    .   circumstances which may result in disqualification,\n    ineligibility, or denial or loss of benefits . . . .\n\n\n\n                              -7-\n\f29 U.S.C. § 1022; see Govoni v. Bricklayers, Masons and Plasterers\n\nInt’l Union of Am., Local No. 5 Pension Fund, 732 F.2d 250, 252 (1st\n\nCir. 1984).   We have recognized that a Plan Summary that violates\n\nthis provision will be binding on a plan administrator.    However, we\n\nhave also held, drawing on common law principles of estoppel, that\n\nsuch relief is only appropriate if the participant demonstrates\n\nsignificant or reasonable reliance on the Plan Summary.    Bachelder v.\n\nCommunications Satellite Corp., 837 F.2d 519, 523 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\nIt is not enough to show a “mere expectation” that certain benefits\n\nwill materialize; action must have been taken in reliance on\n\nreasonable expectations formed after reading the Plan Summary.     See\n\nid. at 523 n. 6.\n\n         Raytheon asserts both that the Plan Summary did not\n\nviolate ERISA’s disclosure provision and that Mauser has failed to\n\nshow significant or reasonable reliance on the Plan Summary.\n\n                               A.\n\n         In its cross-appeal, Raytheon argues that the district\n\ncourt erred in denying its motion for summary judgment as to Mauser’s\n\nclaim of reliance on an alleged inadequate Plan Summary.    Raytheon\n\ncontends that Mauser failed to show any acts taken in reasonable\n\nreliance on the Plan Summary because he stipulated that he had “no\n\nmemory one way or the other whether he read the [Plan Summary] at the\n\ntime of being rehired” by Raytheon.   This stipulation was entered\n\n\n                              -8-\n\finto the day before the district court denied summary judgment.\n\nWhile we agree that Mauser could not demonstrate the requisite level\n\nof reliance if he did not read the Plan Summary at the time of his\n\nre-hire, we are bound by the principle that “[o]rdinarily, the denial\n\nof summary judgment is not appealable.     Acevedo-Garcia v. Vera-\n\nMonroig, 204 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2000).     “An order denying summary\n\njudgment typically does not merge into the final judgment and\n\ntherefore is not an independently appealable event if the case\n\nthereafter proceeds to trial.”    Iacobucci v. Boulter, 193 F.3d 14, 22\n\n(1st Cir. 1999); see also Lama v. Borras, 16 F.3d 473, 476 n. 5 (1st\n\nCir. 1994).   Thus, to be preserved for review, a denial of summary\n\njudgment must be perfected by making a motion for judgment as a\n\nmatter of law at the close of the evidence.     Eastern Mountain\n\nPlatform Tennis, Inc. v. Sherwin-Williams Co., Inc., 40 F.3d 492, 497\n\n(1st Cir. 1994).   Here, because no such motion was made, we may not\n\naddress the merits of this claim.\n\n                                 B.\n\n         Raytheon also argues that the district court erred in\n\nentering judgment in favor of Mauser.     The district court’s factual\n\nfindings are reviewed for clear error.     Roman v. Maietta Const.,\n\nInc., 147 F.3d 71, 74 (1st Cir. 1998).     We review de novo the\n\ndistrict court’s determination as to the governing legal rules and\n\nits application of those rules to the facts.     Id.; Reich v. John\n\n\n                              -9-\n\fAlden Life Ins. Co., 126 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n         The district court found that Mauser demonstrated\n\nsufficient reliance to merit a remedy, even though it characterized\n\nthe reliance as being “thin.”    In reviewing the record of the bench\n\ntrial, we observe that the court only made two findings in support of\n\nits ultimate conclusion.   First, the district court found that Mauser\n\ndid read the Plan Summary upon his re-hire and believed that his pre-\n\n1981 years of service would be counted under the new formula.\n\nSecond, the court found that Mauser heard “through the grapevine from\n\npresent and former Raytheon employees” about Raytheon’s improved\n\npension benefit plan and that “one of the reasons he did not go with\n\nWestinghouse, who had offered him a slightly better plan, was that he\n\nhoped . . . and expected that his pension plan from Raytheon would be\n\nsweeter than that he would get from Westinghouse for whom he had no\n\nprior period of employment.”\n\n         We need not address whether the district court's findings\n\nof fact were clearly erroneous in light of Mauser's stipulation.\n\nRather, we hold that the district court incorrectly applied the law\n\nto the facts found in reaching its conclusion.    There is no evidence\n\nthat Mauser significantly or reasonably relied on the Plan Summary.\n\nFirst, even if Mauser did actually read the Plan Summary at the time\n\nof his re-hire, the mere forming of an expectation as to benefits is\n\nnot enough.   There must be some measurable prejudice to Mauser.\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fBachelder, 837 F.2d at 523 & n.6.   Likewise, Mauser’s decision not to\n\ntake the more lucrative job with Westinghouse cannot constitute\n\nreliance on the Plan Summary because the trial court found that he\n\nrejected this job opportunity on the basis of rumors he had heard\n\nfrom former and current Raytheon employees.   In fact, the district\n\nrecord reveals that Mauser rejected the job offer at Westinghouse\n\nbefore he had even applied to Raytheon.\n\n         As to the other acts — improvements to his home, lavish\n\nwedding for his daughter, failure to make alternate retirement plans,\n\nhis wife’s employment decisions—offered by Mauser to show reliance,\n\nthe district court stated, “While I believe Mr. Mauser’s testimony\n\nabout his financial affairs, the paying for his child’s wedding, I do\n\nnot find that they constitute any detrimental reliance here. . .\n\nThere appears to have been no detailed financial planning done until\n\nhe had the advice of counsel.”   The court’s finding that Mauser did\n\nnot act until after he was advised by an attorney of his legal\n\noptions is not clearly erroneous on the record before us.   We also\n\npoint out that as early as 1990, Mauser became aware, after receiving\n\nhis annual statement of benefits, that he might not be receiving\n\ncredit under the new formula for his pre-1981 years of service.     Any\n\nreliance after that point would have been unreasonable.\n\n         Therefore, we reverse the trial court’s decision to\n\nprovide a remedy to Mauser based on his assertions that he relied on\n\n\n                             -11-\n\fan inadequate Plan Summary. Because we hold that the record at trial\n\nfails to demonstrate significant or reasonable reliance, we need not\n\naddress Raytheon’s arguments regarding the adequacy of the Plan\n\nSummary.   As Mauser did not prevail, we vacate the award of\n\nattorneys' fees.\n\n                                III\n\n           Mauser appeals from the district court’s summary judgment\n\nin favor of Raytheon as to his capricious denial, estoppel, and\n\nfiduciary duty claims.   We review a summary judgment de novo,\n\n“construing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmovant\n\nand resolving all reasonable inferences in that party's favor.”\n\nLandrau-Romero v. Banco Popular De Puerto Rico, 212 F.3d 607, 611\n\n(1st Cir. 2000).   Summary judgment is appropriate if “the pleadings,\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\n\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law.”    Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n\n                                A.\n\n           Mauser alleges that Raytheon administered its Plan\n\narbitrarily and capriciously when it refused to credit his pre-1981\n\nyears of service under the final average salary formula.   See\n\nFirestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Bruch, 489 U.S. 101, 114-15 (1989)\n\n(holding that where the plan administrator has discretionary\n\n\n                                -12-\n\fauthority to determine eligibility for benefits, the administrator’s\n\ndecision not to award benefits will be reversed only if it is\n\n“arbitrary and capricious”).     In support of his claim, Mauser points\n\nto the fact that Raytheon credited the pre-1981 years of service of\n\nLawrence Lavallee, an employee who, like Mauser, left Raytheon before\n\nit implemented the new benefits formula and later returned after a\n\nlengthy break in service.      However, the undisputed evidence before\n\nthe district court showed (1) that Lavallee was paid with respect to\n\nthe pre-1981 years of service out of company assets and not Plan\n\nassets, (2) that Lavallee said he had expressly negotiated for this\n\nfavorable treatment as a condition of his re-employment with\n\nRaytheon, and (3) that it was only after Lavallee made this claim\n\nknown to Raytheon that he received credit for the pre-1981 years of\n\nservice.\n\n           Mauser asserts that “a material question of fact exists\n\nwhether Lavallee had such an agreement or was simply provided a\n\ngenerous interpretation of the plan based upon his long standing\n\nrelationship with someone very high in the Raytheon hierarchy.”\n\nHowever, resolving whether there was an actual agreement between\n\nLavallee and Raytheon or whether Lavallee’s assertions simply fell on\n\nfriendly ears is not material to Mauser’s claim that Raytheon\n\nadministered its plan arbitrarily and capriciously.     See Anderson v.\n\nLiberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986) (“Only disputes over\n\n\n                                -13-\n\ffacts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing\n\nlaw will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment.”).       In\n\norder to prevail, Mauser must demonstrate, at a minimum, that\n\nRaytheon treated him differently from similarly situated employees.\n\nMauser and Lavallee are not similarly situated because Mauser, unlike\n\nLavallee, has never asserted he had an express agreement with\n\nRaytheon regarding the pre-1981 years of service.     In fact, Mauser\n\nacknowledged at his deposition that he never even inquired about the\n\napplicability of the new formula to his pre-1981 years of service\n\nwhen he first returned to Raytheon.     It is irrelevant that, as Mauser\n\nasserts, there may not have been any actual agreement between\n\nLavallee and Raytheon; the critical fact is that Lavallee asserted\n\nthat such an agreement existed.     Raytheon’s response to that\n\ncontention was not unreasonable.     Therefore, we hold that district\n\ncourt properly granted Raytheon’s motion of summary judgment on this\n\nissue.   See Mauser, 31 F.Supp.2d at 171-72.\n\n                               B.\n\n          Mauser also argues that Raytheon should be equitably\n\nestopped from denying him credit for pre-1981 years of service under\n\nthe new formula.   On appeal, Mauser has grounded this assertion\n\nentirely in the alleged inadequacies of the Plan Summary.     An\n\nequitable estoppel claim contains two elements.     First, Raytheon must\n\nhave made “definite misrepresentations of fact” to Mauser with reason\n\n\n                              -14-\n\fto believe that Mauser would rely on it.     Law v. Ernst & Young, 956\n\nF.2d 365, 368 (1st Cir. 1992) (citation and quotation omitted).\n\nSecond, Mauser must “rely reasonably on the misrepresentation to his\n\ndetriment.”   Id.    The district court found that Mauser had failed to\n\nestablish that Raytheon made “definite misrepresentations” to Mauser.\n\nMauser, 31 F.Supp.2d at 174.\n\n          It is, however, still an open question in this circuit\n\nwhether an equitable estoppel claim is permitted under ERISA.       City\n\nof Hope Nat’l Med. Ctr. v. Healthplus, Inc., 156 F.3d 223, 230 n.9\n\n(1st Cir. 1998); Ernst & Young, 956 F.2d at 370 n.9.      ERISA’s\n\nexpansive preemption provision provides that it “shall supersede any\n\nand all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any\n\nemployee benefit plan.”     29 U.S.C. § 1144(a).   The Supreme Court has\n\ndirected that federal courts may engage in interstitial rule-making\n\nwhen it is in the interests of justice.     See Bruch, 489 U.S. at 110;\n\nPilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U.S. 41, 56 (1987); Kwatcher v.\n\nMass. Serv. Employees Pension Fund, 879 F.2d 957, 966 (1st Cir.\n\n1989).   However, we must exercise caution in creating new common law\n\nrules for pension plans; we should only act when there is, in fact, a\n\ngap in the structure of ERISA or in the existing federal common law\n\nrelating to ERISA.     See Andersen v. Chrysler Corp., 99 F.3d 846, 856\n\n(7th Cir. 1996).\n\n          Mauser’s equitable estoppel claim is virtually\n\n\n                                -15-\n\findistinguishable from his claim, discussed in part II of this\n\nopinion, that the Plan Summary violates ERISA’s disclosure\n\nprovisions.     Because we have already established an avenue for relief\n\nfor reliance on an inadequate Plan Summary, we hold there is not a\n\nmore general equitable estoppel claim based solely on an inadequate\n\nPlan Summary.     We leave for an appropriate case whether there may\n\nexist an equitable estoppel claim in cases where misrepresentations\n\nexist apart from the Plan Summary.     Therefore, we affirm the district\n\ncourt’s summary judgment, albeit for different reasons.\n\n\n\n\n                                 C.\n\n         Like Mauser’s equitable estoppel claim, his breach of\n\nfiduciary duty claim rests solely on the alleged inadequacies of the\n\nPlan Summary.     The Supreme Court in Varity Corp. v. Howe, 516 U.S.\n\n489 (1996), recognized that ERISA authorizes individual lawsuits for\n\nbreach of fiduciary duty.     Id. at 507-515.   However, “where Congress\n\nelsewhere provided adequate relief for a beneficiary’s injury, there\n\nwill likely be no need for further equitable relief, in which case\n\nsuch relief normally would not be appropriate.”      Id. at 515\n\n(quotation omitted).     The Supreme Court has thus limited the\n\napplicability of an individual claim for breach of fiduciary duty to\n\nthose participants who are unable to avail themselves of other\n\n\n                                -16-\n\fremedies.    See Wilkins v. Baptist Healthcare Sys., Inc., 150 F.3d\n\n609, 615 (6th Cir. 1998).    As discussed in part II, we have an\n\nestablished remedy for significant or reasonable reliance on a\n\nstatutorily inadequate Plan Summary.    We therefore do not recognize a\n\nduplicative claim for breach of fiduciary duty based wholly on an\n\ninadequate Plan Summary.    See Rhorer v. Raytheon Engineers &\n\nConstructors, Inc., 181 F.3d 634, 639 (5th Cir. 1999).    Although our\n\nremedy for violations of ERISA’s disclosure provisions does not\n\ndepend exclusively on congressionally-crafted language (because we\n\ndraw on the common law of estoppel for guidance as to when relief is\n\nappropriate), our decision is true to the general principle\n\nreiterated in Varity and in Bruch that we should avoid creating\n\nduplicative remedies for violations of ERISA’s provisions.\n\n                                IV\n\n            After trial, Mauser asked the district court to add a\n\nclaim for statutory penalties under 29 U.S.C. § 1132(c), which allows\n\ncourts to impose a $100-per-day fine for delay in providing requested\n\nbenefits information.    “The decision whether to allow amendment is\n\nwithin the discretion of the trial judge and will be reversed only\n\nwhere that discretion has been abused.”    Keeler v. Hewitt, 697 F.2d\n\n8, 14 (1st Cir. 1982).\n\n            The district court denied Mauser’s motion, stating\n\n    Although Mauser might have had a very strong case for the\n\n\n                               -17-\n\f    imposition of fines had he included the section 1132(c)\n    claim in his complaint, he cannot fairly attempt to add it\n    now.   First Circuit precedent permits a cause of action to\n    arise pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(b) “if, during the\n    trial, a party acquiesces in the introduction of evidence\n    which is relevant only to that issue.”   Rodriguez v. Doral\n    Mortgage Corp., 57 F.3d 1168, 1172 (1st Cir. 1995)\n    (quoting DCPB, Inc. v. City of Lebanon, 957 F.2d 913, 917\n    (1st Cir. 1992)).   Without doubt, Mauser’s introduction of\n    Raytheon’s failure to supply pension benefit calculations\n    until 1995 was relevant to whether Mauser relied on the\n    Summary’s description of determining benefits for break-\n    in-service employees.   Since reliance is a key element of\n    ERISA disclosure violations, see Bachelder, 837 F.2d at\n    522-23, Raytheon could not have been expected to know that\n    “a new issue was infiltrating the case,” DCPB, 957 F.2d at\n    917.\n\nWe adopt the district court’s reasoning and hold that there was no\n\nabuse of discretion in denying Mauser’s post-trial motion to amend\n\nhis complaint.\n\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART\n\n\n\n\n                             -18-\n\f",

Mauser appeals from the district\n\ncourt’s summary judgment for Raytheon Company Pension Plan for\n\nSalaried Employees and Raytheon Company (together, Raytheon) as to\n\nhis claims that (1) Raytheon arbitrarily and capriciously denied him\n\npension benefits; (2) Raytheon should be estopped from denying him\n\nbenefits; and (3) Raytheon violated its fiduciary obligations under\n\nthe Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1001 et seq.    Mauser also contests the remedy and\n\nattorneys’ fees awarded by the district court after trial on his\n\nfourth claim, which alleged that he detrimentally relied on a\n\nmisleading summary plan description.      Finally, Mauser asserts that\n\nthe district court abused its discretion when, after trial, it did\n\nnot allow Mauser to amend his complaint in order to bring a claim for\n\nstatutory penalties under ERISA.      In its cross-appeal, Raytheon\n\nargues that the district court erred in denying Raytheon’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment as to Mauser’s claim of reliance on an inadequate\n\nsummary plan description and in holding against Raytheon on that\n\nclaim at trial.    The district court had jurisdiction under 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1132(e) and 28 U.S.C. § 1331.      We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1291.    We affirm in part and reverse in part.\n\n                                I\n\n\n\n                               -2-\n\f         Mauser’s first stint of employment for Raytheon began in\n\nSeptember 1966 and ended on February 29, 1980.     During this period,\n\nMauser became completely vested in Raytheon’s contributory defined\n\nbenefit plan, which, at that time, calculated benefits using a\n\nparticipant’s career average salary.     After Mauser left Raytheon in\n\n1980, he received a letter explaining his pension benefit: at age 65,\n\nhe would receive $453.17 per month or, if he withdrew his\n\ncontributions, $243.09 per month.   Mauser withdrew his contributions\n\nby an application dated August 30, 1982.\n\n         Effective January 1, 1981, Raytheon made its plan non-\n\ncontributory and changed its benefits formula to one based on a\n\nparticipant’s final average salary, thereby significantly increasing\n\nretirement benefits for eligible employees.     The plan was renamed\n\n“Raytheon Company Pension Plan for Salaried Employees” (Plan).      Under\n\nthe terms of the Plan, the new formula did not apply to Mauser\n\nbecause he was not an active employee on December 31, 1980, and did\n\nnot fall within one of the exceptions.\n\n         During 1987, Mauser learned from current and former\n\nRaytheon employees of the favorable change to Raytheon’s pension\n\nbenefit formula.   With this information in mind, Mauser states that\n\nhe turned down a job at Westinghouse Company during February 1988,\n\nand in April 1988 he applied to Raytheon.     Upon his re-hire at\n\nRaytheon, he received a copy of the current summary plan description\n\n\n                              -3-\n\f(Plan Summary) which contained the following section:\n\n    If you leave Raytheon and later return\n    . . . .\n    [I]f you leave the company and are away longer than 12\n    months, you won’t receive credit for the time you were\n    away.       Whether the service you had before you left will be\n    counted depends on whether or not you were vested when you\n    left, and on the length of time you were gone.\n           It will be counted when you have completed a year of\n    service after you return if any of the following applies:\n           1.     You were vested when you left\n           2.     Your time away is less than the service you had\n                  before you left\n           3.     You left after 1/1/85, and your time away is\n                  less than five years.\n\n\nThe district court found that Mauser read this statement and believed\n\nthat his pre-1981 years of service would be taken into account when\n\nhis pension was calculated under the new, final average salary\n\nformula.\n\n           Mauser asserts that in reliance on his reading of the Plan\n\nSummary, he “rejected a more lucrative offer of employment with\n\nWestinghouse Company, made improvements on his home, provided his\n\ndaughter a lavish wedding, did not make alternate or additional\n\nretirement income plans, agreed his wife did not need to obtain\n\nemployment with a promise of future pension benefits, and remained in\n\nthe employ of Raytheon.\"\n\n                                    -4-\n\f            In 1990, Mauser received a personal statement of benefits\n\nfrom Raytheon; he realized that it did not include any credit for his\n\npre-1981 years of service.    Mauser orally requested a corrected\n\nstatement, which he did not receive.     However, Mauser did not make\n\nclear to Raytheon his belief that his prior years of service would be\n\nincluded in calculating his benefits.     The benefits statements from\n\n1991 through 1994 all failed to include credit for pre-1981 service,\n\nand Mauser continued, unsuccessfully, to make verbal requests for a\n\ncorrected statement.    Beginning in November of 1994, Mauser made a\n\nmore intense, written effort to ascertain the scope of his benefits.\n\nEarly in 1995 Raytheon informed Mauser that his pre-1981 years of\n\nservice would not be used in calculating his pension.      Mauser then\n\nhired an attorney and has consistently maintained that he is entitled\n\nto a calculation of benefits under the new formula that takes into\n\naccount both his first and second periods of employment with\n\nRaytheon.\n\n            Mauser brought four claims against Raytheon.   First, he\n\nalleged that Raytheon’s administration of benefits was arbitrary and\n\ncapricious because Raytheon had granted credit to one employee for\n\nhis pre-1981 years of service.    (This claim also included\n\nallegations, not raised on appeal, that Raytheon had arbitrarily and\n\ncapriciously misinterpreted the Plan.)     Next, Mauser alleged that\n\nRaytheon should be estopped from denying him credit for his pre-1981\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fyears of service because Raytheon had purposefully misrepresented its\n\nposition regarding break-in-service employees (estoppel claim).     In\n\naddition, Mauser’s complaint asserted that Raytheon’s actions\n\namounted to a breach of its fiduciary duty under ERISA (fiduciary\n\nduty claim).   These three claims — capricious denial, estoppel, and\n\nfiduciary duty — were resolved in Raytheon’s favor on its motion for\n\nsummary judgment.   See Mauser v. Raytheon Co. Pension Plan for\n\nSalaried Employees, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2516295\"><a href=\"/opinion/2516295/in-re-mauser-v-raytheon-co-pension/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">168</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D. Mass. 1998).\n\n           A bench trial was held on Mauser’s final claim that\n\nRaytheon’s Plan Summary violated ERISA’s disclosure requirements.\n\nThe district court concluded that the Plan Summary was inadequate and\n\nthat there was “some” “thin” reliance.   It held that Mauser would be\n\nallowed to redeposit his withdrawn contributions; however, the new\n\nformula would not be applied to include the pre-1981 years of\n\nservice.   Mauser requested attorneys’ fees in the amount of $156,201,\n\nbut the court, after taking into account various factors, awarded\n\nonly $35,000 in fees.   After trial, Mauser asked the district court\n\nto allow him to amend his complaint to include a claim for statutory\n\npenalties against Raytheon for refusing to provide benefit\n\ninformation in violation of 29 U.S.C. §1132(c).   The district court\n\ndenied this request to amend.\n\n                                II\n\n           At the heart of this appeal is Mauser’s claim that\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fRaytheon is bound by the Plan Summary to credit his pre-1981 years of\n\nservice under its favorable, final average salary formula.     One of\n\nERISA’s civil enforcement provisions provides that a participant may\n\nbring an action “(A) to enjoin any act or practice which violates any\n\nprovision of this subchapter . . . or (B) to obtain other appropriate\n\nequitable relief (i) to redress such violations or (ii) to enforce\n\nany provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan.”     29\n\nU.S.C. § 1132(a)(3).   Mauser asserts that he is entitled to “other\n\nappropriate equitable relief” because the Plan Summary violated\n\nERISA’s disclosure provision, which provides:\n\n\n\n    (a) A summary plan description of any employee benefit\n    plan shall be furnished to participants and beneficiaries\n    . . . . The summary plan description shall include the\n    information described in subsection (b) of this section,\n    shall be written in a manner calculated to be understood\n    by the average plan participant, and shall be sufficiently\n    accurate and comprehensive to reasonably apprise such\n    participants and beneficiaries of their rights and\n    obligations under the plan. . . .\n\n\n    (b) The summary plan description shall contain the\n    following information: . . . the plan's requirements\n    respecting eligibility for participation and benefits; . .\n    .   circumstances which may result in disqualification,\n    ineligibility, or denial or loss of benefits . . . .\n\n\n\n                              -7-\n\f29 U.S.C. § 1022; see Govoni v.

We have recognized that a Plan Summary that violates\n\nthis provision will be binding on a plan administrator.    However, we\n\nhave also held, drawing on common law principles of estoppel, that\n\nsuch relief is only appropriate if the participant demonstrates\n\nsignificant or reasonable reliance on the Plan Summary.

See\n\nid. at 523 n. 6.\n\n         Raytheon asserts both that the Plan Summary did not\n\nviolate ERISA’s disclosure provision and that Mauser has failed to\n\nshow significant or reasonable reliance on the Plan Summary.\n\n                               A.\n\n         In its cross-appeal, Raytheon argues that the district\n\ncourt erred in denying its motion for summary judgment as to Mauser’s\n\nclaim of reliance on an alleged inadequate Plan Summary.    Raytheon\n\ncontends that Mauser failed to show any acts taken in reasonable\n\nreliance on the Plan Summary because he stipulated that he had “no\n\nmemory one way or the other whether he read the [Plan Summary] at the\n\ntime of being rehired” by Raytheon.   This stipulation was entered\n\n\n                              -8-\n\finto the day before the district court denied summary judgment.\n\nWhile we agree that Mauser could not demonstrate the requisite level\n\nof reliance if he did not read the Plan Summary at the time of his\n\nre-hire, we are bound by the principle that “[o]rdinarily, the denial\n\nof summary judgment is not appealable.

First, the district court found that Mauser\n\ndid read the Plan Summary upon his re-hire and believed that his pre-\n\n1981 years of service would be counted under the new formula.\n\nSecond, the court found that Mauser heard “through the grapevine from\n\npresent and former Raytheon employees” about Raytheon’s improved\n\npension benefit plan and that “one of the reasons he did not go with\n\nWestinghouse, who had offered him a slightly better plan, was that he\n\nhoped . . . and expected that his pension plan from Raytheon would be\n\nsweeter than that he would get from Westinghouse for whom he had no\n\nprior period of employment.”\n\n         We need not address whether the district court's findings\n\nof fact were clearly erroneous in light of Mauser's stipulation.\n\nRather, we hold that the district court incorrectly applied the law\n\nto the facts found in reaching its conclusion.    There is no evidence\n\nthat Mauser significantly or reasonably relied on the Plan Summary.\n\nFirst, even if Mauser did actually read the Plan Summary at the time\n\nof his re-hire, the mere forming of an expectation as to benefits is\n\nnot enough.   There must be some measurable prejudice to Mauser.\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fBachelder, 837 F.2d at 523 & n.6.   Likewise, Mauser’s decision not to\n\ntake the more lucrative job with Westinghouse cannot constitute\n\nreliance on the Plan Summary because the trial court found that he\n\nrejected this job opportunity on the basis of rumors he had heard\n\nfrom former and current Raytheon employees.   In fact, the district\n\nrecord reveals that Mauser rejected the job offer at Westinghouse\n\nbefore he had even applied to Raytheon.\n\n         As to the other acts — improvements to his home, lavish\n\nwedding for his daughter, failure to make alternate retirement plans,\n\nhis wife’s employment decisions—offered by Mauser to show reliance,\n\nthe district court stated, “While I believe Mr. Mauser’s testimony\n\nabout his financial affairs, the paying for his child’s wedding, I do\n\nnot find that they constitute any detrimental reliance here. . .\n\nThere appears to have been no detailed financial planning done until\n\nhe had the advice of counsel.”   The court’s finding that Mauser did\n\nnot act until after he was advised by an attorney of his legal\n\noptions is not clearly erroneous on the record before us.   We also\n\npoint out that as early as 1990, Mauser became aware, after receiving\n\nhis annual statement of benefits, that he might not be receiving\n\ncredit under the new formula for his pre-1981 years of service.     Any\n\nreliance after that point would have been unreasonable.\n\n         Therefore, we reverse the trial court’s decision to\n\nprovide a remedy to Mauser based on his assertions that he relied on\n\n\n                             -11-\n\fan inadequate Plan Summary. Because we hold that the record at trial\n\nfails to demonstrate significant or reasonable reliance, we need not\n\naddress Raytheon’s arguments regarding the adequacy of the Plan\n\nSummary.   As Mauser did not prevail, we vacate the award of\n\nattorneys' fees.\n\n                                III\n\n           Mauser appeals from the district court’s summary judgment\n\nin favor of Raytheon as to his capricious denial, estoppel, and\n\nfiduciary duty claims.   We review a summary judgment de novo,\n\n“construing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmovant\n\nand resolving all reasonable inferences in that party's favor.”\n\nLandrau-Romero v. Banco Popular De Puerto Rico, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 611\n\n(1st Cir. 2000).   Summary judgment is appropriate if “the pleadings,\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\n\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law.”    Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n\n                                A.\n\n           Mauser alleges that Raytheon administered its Plan\n\narbitrarily and capriciously when it refused to credit his pre-1981\n\nyears of service under the final average salary formula.   See\n\nFirestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Bruch, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112197\"><a href=\"/opinion/112197/firestone-tire-rubber-co-v-bruch/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 114-15 (1989)\n\n(holding that where the plan administrator has discretionary\n\n\n                                -12-\n\fauthority to determine eligibility for benefits, the administrator’s\n\ndecision not to award benefits will be reversed only if it is\n\n“arbitrary and capricious”).     In support of his claim, Mauser points\n\nto the fact that Raytheon credited the pre-1981 years of service of\n\nLawrence Lavallee, an employee who, like Mauser, left Raytheon before\n\nit implemented the new benefits formula and later returned after a\n\nlengthy break in service.      However, the undisputed evidence before\n\nthe district court showed (1) that Lavallee was paid with respect to\n\nthe pre-1981 years of service out of company assets and not Plan\n\nassets, (2) that Lavallee said he had expressly negotiated for this\n\nfavorable treatment as a condition of his re-employment with\n\nRaytheon, and (3) that it was only after Lavallee made this claim\n\nknown to Raytheon that he received credit for the pre-1981 years of\n\nservice.\n\n           Mauser asserts that “a material question of fact exists\n\nwhether Lavallee had such an agreement or was simply provided a\n\ngenerous interpretation of the plan based upon his long standing\n\nrelationship with someone very high in the Raytheon hierarchy.”\n\nHowever, resolving whether there was an actual agreement between\n\nLavallee and Raytheon or whether Lavallee’s assertions simply fell on\n\nfriendly ears is not material to Mauser’s claim that Raytheon\n\nadministered its plan arbitrarily and capriciously.     See Anderson v.\n\nLiberty Lobby, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111719\"><a href=\"/opinion/111719/anderson-v-liberty-lobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 248 (1986) (“Only disputes over\n\n\n                                -13-\n\ffacts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing\n\nlaw will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment.”).       In\n\norder to prevail, Mauser must demonstrate, at a minimum, that\n\nRaytheon treated him differently from similarly situated employees.\n\nMauser and Lavallee are not similarly situated because Mauser, unlike\n\nLavallee, has never asserted he had an express agreement with\n\nRaytheon regarding the pre-1981 years of service.     In fact, Mauser\n\nacknowledged at his deposition that he never even inquired about the\n\napplicability of the new formula to his pre-1981 years of service\n\nwhen he first returned to Raytheon.     It is irrelevant that, as Mauser\n\nasserts, there may not have been any actual agreement between\n\nLavallee and Raytheon; the critical fact is that Lavallee asserted\n\nthat such an agreement existed.     Raytheon’s response to that\n\ncontention was not unreasonable.     Therefore, we hold that district\n\ncourt properly granted Raytheon’s motion of summary judgment on this\n\nissue.   See Mauser, 31 F.Supp.2d at 171-72.\n\n                               B.\n\n          Mauser also argues that Raytheon should be equitably\n\nestopped from denying him credit for pre-1981 years of service under\n\nthe new formula.   On appeal, Mauser has grounded this assertion\n\nentirely in the alleged inadequacies of the Plan Summary.     An\n\nequitable estoppel claim contains two elements.     First, Raytheon must\n\nhave made “definite misrepresentations of fact” to Mauser with reason\n\n\n                              -14-\n\fto believe that Mauser would rely on it.     Law v. Ernst & Young, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">956</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">365</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 368 (1st Cir. 1992) (citation and quotation omitted).\n\nSecond, Mauser must “rely reasonably on the misrepresentation to his\n\ndetriment.”   Id.    The district court found that Mauser had failed to\n\nestablish that Raytheon made “definite misrepresentations” to Mauser.\n\nMauser, 31 F.Supp.2d at 174.\n\n          It is, however, still an open question in this circuit\n\nwhether an equitable estoppel claim is permitted under ERISA.       City\n\nof Hope Nat’l Med. Ctr. v. Healthplus, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"758014\"><a href=\"/opinion/758014/city-of-hope-national-medical-center-v-healthplus-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 230 n.9\n\n(1st Cir. 1998); Ernst & Young, 956 F.2d at 370 n.9.      ERISA’s\n\nexpansive preemption provision provides that it “shall supersede any\n\nand all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any\n\nemployee benefit plan.”     29 U.S.C. § 1144(a).   The Supreme Court has\n\ndirected that federal courts may engage in interstitial rule-making\n\nwhen it is in the interests of justice.     See Bruch, 489 U.S. at 110;\n\nPilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111858\"><a href=\"/opinion/111858/pilot-life-ins-co-v-dedeaux/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 56 (1987); Kwatcher v.\n\nMass.

However, we must exercise caution in creating new common law\n\nrules for pension plans; we should only act when there is, in fact, a\n\ngap in the structure of ERISA or in the existing federal common law\n\nrelating to ERISA.     See Andersen v. Chrysler Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"728943\"><a href=\"/opinion/728943/pens-plan-guide-p-23928n-william-andersen-robert-chriske-marlyn/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">846</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 856\n\n(7th Cir. 1996).\n\n          Mauser’s equitable estoppel claim is virtually\n\n\n                                -15-\n\findistinguishable from his claim, discussed in part II of this\n\nopinion, that the Plan Summary violates ERISA’s disclosure\n\nprovisions.     Because we have already established an avenue for relief\n\nfor reliance on an inadequate Plan Summary, we hold there is not a\n\nmore general equitable estoppel claim based solely on an inadequate\n\nPlan Summary.     We leave for an appropriate case whether there may\n\nexist an equitable estoppel claim in cases where misrepresentations\n\nexist apart from the Plan Summary.     Therefore, we affirm the district\n\ncourt’s summary judgment, albeit for different reasons.\n\n\n\n\n                                 C.\n\n         Like Mauser’s equitable estoppel claim, his breach of\n\nfiduciary duty claim rests solely on the alleged inadequacies of the\n\nPlan Summary.     The Supreme Court in Varity Corp. v. Howe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118008\"><a href=\"/opinion/118008/varity-corp-v-howe/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">489</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1996), recognized that ERISA authorizes individual lawsuits for\n\nbreach of fiduciary duty.     Id. at 507-515.   However, “where Congress\n\nelsewhere provided adequate relief for a beneficiary’s injury, there\n\nwill likely be no need for further equitable relief, in which case\n\nsuch relief normally would not be appropriate.”      Id. at 515\n\n(quotation omitted).     The Supreme Court has thus limited the\n\napplicability of an individual claim for breach of fiduciary duty to\n\nthose participants who are unable to avail themselves of other\n\n\n                                -16-\n\fremedies.    See Wilkins v. Baptist Healthcare Sys., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"756481\"><a href=\"/opinion/756481/bob-g-wilkins-v-baptist-healthcare-system-inc-life-insurance-company-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">609</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 615 (6th Cir. 1998).    As discussed in part II, we have an\n\nestablished remedy for significant or reasonable reliance on a\n\nstatutorily inadequate Plan Summary.    We therefore do not recognize a\n\nduplicative claim for breach of fiduciary duty based wholly on an\n\ninadequate Plan Summary.    See Rhorer v. Raytheon Engineers &\n\nConstructors, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"18038\"><a href=\"/opinion/18038/rhorer-v-raytheon-engineers/\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">634</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 639 (5th Cir. 1999).    Although our\n\nremedy for violations of ERISA’s disclosure provisions does not\n\ndepend exclusively on congressionally-crafted language (because we\n\ndraw on the common law of estoppel for guidance as to when relief is\n\nappropriate), our decision is true to the general principle\n\nreiterated in Varity and in Bruch that we should avoid creating\n\nduplicative remedies for violations of ERISA’s provisions.\n\n                                IV\n\n            After trial, Mauser asked the district court to add a\n\nclaim for statutory penalties under 29 U.S.C. § 1132(c), which allows\n\ncourts to impose a $100-per-day fine for delay in providing requested\n\nbenefits information.    “The decision whether to allow amendment is\n\nwithin the discretion of the trial judge and will be reversed only\n\nwhere that discretion has been abused.”    Keeler v. Hewitt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"412696\"><a href=\"/opinion/412696/duane-keeler-v-david-hewitt/\"><span class=\"volume\">697</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 14 (1st Cir. 1982).\n\n            The district court denied Mauser’s motion, stating\n\n    Although Mauser might have had a very strong case for the\n\n\n                               -17-\n\f    imposition of fines had he included the section 1132(c)\n    claim in his complaint, he cannot fairly attempt to add it\n    now.   First Circuit precedent permits a cause of action to\n    arise pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(b) “if, during the\n    trial, a party acquiesces in the introduction of evidence\n    which is relevant only to that issue.”   Rodriguez v. Doral\n    Mortgage Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196161\"><a href=\"/opinion/196161/rodriguez-bruno-v-doral-mortgage/\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1168</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1172 (1st Cir. 1995)\n    (quoting DCPB, Inc. v.

Without doubt, Mauser’s introduction of\n    Raytheon’s failure to supply pension benefit calculations\n    until 1995 was relevant to whether Mauser relied on the\n    Summary’s description of determining benefits for break-\n    in-service employees.   Since reliance is a key element of\n    ERISA disclosure violations, see Bachelder, 837 F.2d at\n    522-23, Raytheon could not have been expected to know that\n    “a new issue was infiltrating the case,” DCPB, 957 F.2d at\n    917.\n\nWe adopt the district court’s reasoning and hold that there was no\n\nabuse of discretion in denying Mauser’s post-trial motion to amend\n\nhis complaint.\n\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART\n\n\n\n\n                             -18-\n\f</pre>",
