On the arguendo  assumption that appellate\r                           \r\n\njurisdiction exists, we summarily affirm the district court's\r\n\njudgment.

See Sandin v. Conner, 115 S. Ct. 2293,\r                                                       \r\n\n2301-02  (1995).    Far  from calling  this  conclusion  into\r\n\nquestion, plaintiff has failed even to  mention the matter on\r\n\nappeal.   His  separate contention  concerning the  status of\r\n\ndiscovery  proves  unavailing,  inasmuch as  the  information\r\n\nrequested had no bearing on the Sandin issue. \r                                                  \r\n\n     Affirmed.
