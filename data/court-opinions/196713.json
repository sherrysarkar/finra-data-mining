The  Company was\r\n\ncharged with  violation of sections  8(a)(5) and  (1) of  the\r\n\nNational Labor  Relations Act  (Act), 29  U.S.C.    158(a)(5)\r\n\nand (1), by withholding granting wage increases.   We enforce\r\n\nthe order.\r\n\n                     The Unfair Practice\r                                                    \r\n\n          The Board found  that for 18 years the  Company had\r\n\ngranted annual  merit-based salary increases to its reporters\r\n\nbased  on individual  evaluation, effective  January of  each\r\n\nyear.  In January of 1990-92 the individual raises had varied\r\n\nbetween 3%  and 8%.  In 1993  the Company, instead, granted a\r\n\nflat 1%.  The Board chose to regard this as  a continuance of\r\n\nthe practice.  In  January of 1994, however, the  Company had\r\n\nbegun  negotiations  for   its  first  collective  bargaining\r\n\nagreement  (CBA)   with  a   newly  certified  union,1   and,\r\n\nallegedly believing  that to  do otherwise would  violate the\r\n\nAct, it  unilaterally discontinued all merit  wage increases.\r\n\nIt  did not  notify the  union, nor  did it  indicate it  was\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  In  February of  1993 the  Union de  Periodistas y  Artes\r\nGraficas y Ramas Anexas, Local 225, The Newspaper Guild, AFL-\r\nCIO, CLC,  was certified to  represent all  of the  Company's\r\nreporters   and  reporter-anchor  persons   employed  at  its\r\ntelevision facilities in Puerto Rico.\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nmerely  temporarily suspending the program during bargaining.\r\n\nIn  May, 1994, during bargaining, the union filed the present\r\n\ncharge.\r\n\n          If this  were a novel matter we  might have initial\r\n\nsympathy  with the  Company's view  that it  was between  the\r\n\ndevil and the  deep blue.   It claims  to have suspended  its\r\n\nannual merit increases  because awarding discretionary  merit\r\n\npay increases during bargaining seemed  to it to fall  within\r\n\nthe prohibition  on making changes with  respect to mandatory\r\n\nbargaining  matters, in  violation of  section 8(a)(5).   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nNLRB  v. Katz,  369 U.S.  736, 745-46  (1962).   Indeed, with\r                         \r\n\nunilateral  discretion, there  would seem  room  for improper\r\n\nmaneuvering.   Id.  at 746-47.   However,  Katz distinguished\r                                                           \r\n\nbetween  merit  increases that  are  part  of an  established\r\n\npractice of granting annual merit reviews, and those that are\r\n\nnot,  id.  at  746, ruling  that  granting  the  latter is  a\r                    \r\n\nviolation of the Act.   Id.  Here, the Board found  that even\r                                       \r\n\nthough the  amounts of  the increases were  discretionary, it\r\n\nwas  abandonment of  the practice  itself that  was forbidden\r\n\nunder the Act.

No. 165 (July 20, 1995).\r\n\n          The record adequately supports the Board's finding,\r\n\nand we have no reason to disagree with it.  Rather, we are in\r\n\nfull accord with the recent similar case of Daily News of Los\r                                                                         \r\n\nAngeles  v.

The Company objects, first, on the\r\n\nground  that  the  backpay  order  transgressed  the  Board's\r\n\nauthority, because the raises were always discretionary as to\r\n\namount  and, as  such, not  amenable to  Board determination.\r\n\nThis thought has been sufficiently answered by the Daily News\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\ncourt.   73 F.3d at  415.  More interesting  is the Company's\r\n\nnext suggestion, that the wage question is now moot.\r\n\n          The Company and the union completed bargaining  and\r\n\nentered into  a CBA, effective September 22,  1995, that sets\r\n\nwages retroactive  to January 1,  1994.  The  Company asserts\r\n\nthat  the CBA  contains a  so-called zipper  clause providing\r\n\nthat  it   comprises  \"the   complete  agreement   among  the\r\n\nparties.\"4   In this  circumstance the Company  would have us\r\n\nsay that the Board's ordered remedy, insofar as it relates to\r\n\nlost wages from  January 1994 plus  interest, has been  taken\r\n\ncare of  by the CBA, rendering the order moot or, at the very\r\n\nleast, obviating  the need  for further backpay  proceedings.\r\n\nFurther proceedings  would necessarily  involve the  Board in\r\n\nimpermissibly  interfering with  the bargaining  process, and\r\n\naltering the terms  of the CBA.

The CBA  succeeded the\r\n\norder, and was not, and never has been, presented to it.  The\r\n\nterms  are   not  of  record.     Board  counsel's  courteous\r\n\naffirmative answer  to our  question about the  zipper clause\r\n\nwas accompanied by a statement that his answer could not bind\r\n\nthe Board.  Nor can we take, of our own accord, the Company's\r\n\nsubmission of the CBA.

In other  words, as a\r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\nmatter of law, any compliance order would operate to alter or\r\n\nimpermissibly supplement  the terms of the  CBA, in violation\r\n\nof   8(d) of the Act.  H.K. Porter, 397 U.S. at 103-04.  This\r                                              \r\n\nis simply not so.  The Board, in effect, found the bargaining\r\n\nhad not  been on  the now universally-demanded  level playing\r\n\nfield.   More  exactly, having  unfairly lacked  the expected\r\n\nbenefits  of  the   unilaterally  cancelled  merit   increase\r\n\nprogram, the union was  required to start behind the  line of\r\n\nscrimmage.   As observed in  John Zink Co.,  196 N.L.R.B. 942\r                                                      \r\n\n(1972),  1972 WL 12497 at  *1, the employer  is \"enjoying the\r\n\nfruits  of  his  unfair  labor practices  and  gaining  undue\r\n\nadvantage at the bargaining table  when he bargains about the\r\n\nbenefits which he has already [illegally] discontinued.\"\r\n\n          The Board's order means that the bargaining was not\r\n\nfree, a  matter of public, as well  as private, concern.  Cf.\r                                                                         \r\n\nPhelps  Dodge Corp.  v.

Did the  Company\r\n\nchange its behavior, admit,  for example, merit increases for\r\n\nJanuary  1, 1994?  We, of course,  make no suggestion, but it\r\n\nis  for  the  Board, not  the  Company,  to  say whether  the\r\n\nultimate bargaining in fact  accomplished the entirety of the\r\n\nBoard's purpose.\r\n\n          The  Company's petition is  denied, and the Board's\r                                                        \r\n\napplication for enforcement is granted.\r                                                  \r\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n",

The  Company was\r\n\ncharged with  violation of sections  8(a)(5) and  (1) of  the\r\n\nNational Labor  Relations Act  (Act), 29  U.S.C.    158(a)(5)\r\n\nand (1), by withholding granting wage increases.   We enforce\r\n\nthe order.\r\n\n                     The Unfair Practice\r                                                    \r\n\n          The Board found  that for 18 years the  Company had\r\n\ngranted annual  merit-based salary increases to its reporters\r\n\nbased  on individual  evaluation, effective  January of  each\r\n\nyear.  In January of 1990-92 the individual raises had varied\r\n\nbetween 3%  and 8%.  In 1993  the Company, instead, granted a\r\n\nflat 1%.  The Board chose to regard this as  a continuance of\r\n\nthe practice.  In  January of 1994, however, the  Company had\r\n\nbegun  negotiations  for   its  first  collective  bargaining\r\n\nagreement  (CBA)   with  a   newly  certified  union,1   and,\r\n\nallegedly believing  that to  do otherwise would  violate the\r\n\nAct, it  unilaterally discontinued all merit  wage increases.\r\n\nIt  did not  notify the  union, nor  did it  indicate it  was\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  In  February of  1993 the  Union de  Periodistas y  Artes\r\nGraficas y Ramas Anexas, Local 225, The Newspaper Guild, AFL-\r\nCIO, CLC,  was certified to  represent all  of the  Company's\r\nreporters   and  reporter-anchor  persons   employed  at  its\r\ntelevision facilities in Puerto Rico.\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nmerely  temporarily suspending the program during bargaining.\r\n\nIn  May, 1994, during bargaining, the union filed the present\r\n\ncharge.\r\n\n          If this  were a novel matter we  might have initial\r\n\nsympathy  with the  Company's view  that it  was between  the\r\n\ndevil and the  deep blue.   It claims  to have suspended  its\r\n\nannual merit increases  because awarding discretionary  merit\r\n\npay increases during bargaining seemed  to it to fall  within\r\n\nthe prohibition  on making changes with  respect to mandatory\r\n\nbargaining  matters, in  violation of  section 8(a)(5).

The Company objects, first, on the\r\n\nground  that  the  backpay  order  transgressed  the  Board's\r\n\nauthority, because the raises were always discretionary as to\r\n\namount  and, as  such, not  amenable to  Board determination.\r\n\nThis thought has been sufficiently answered by the Daily News\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\ncourt.   73 F.3d at  415.  More interesting  is the Company's\r\n\nnext suggestion, that the wage question is now moot.\r\n\n          The Company and the union completed bargaining  and\r\n\nentered into  a CBA, effective September 22,  1995, that sets\r\n\nwages retroactive  to January 1,  1994.  The  Company asserts\r\n\nthat  the CBA  contains a  so-called zipper  clause providing\r\n\nthat  it   comprises  \"the   complete  agreement   among  the\r\n\nparties.\"4   In this  circumstance the Company  would have us\r\n\nsay that the Board's ordered remedy, insofar as it relates to\r\n\nlost wages from  January 1994 plus  interest, has been  taken\r\n\ncare of  by the CBA, rendering the order moot or, at the very\r\n\nleast, obviating  the need  for further backpay  proceedings.\r\n\nFurther proceedings  would necessarily  involve the  Board in\r\n\nimpermissibly  interfering with  the bargaining  process, and\r\n\naltering the terms  of the CBA.
