This is the first time we\r\nhave had occasion to construe the Family and Medical Leave Act of\r\n1993 (\"FMLA\"), 29 U.S.C.  2601-2619 (1994), which established\r\nimportant rights that protect millions of American employees.\r\nPlaintiff John Hodgens sued his former employer, General\r\nDynamics Corporation (\"General Dynamics\" or \"GD\"), for allegedly\r\nterminating his employment because he took necessary medical leave\r\nthat was protected under the FMLA.  His complaint further alleged\r\nthat his discharge constituted discrimination based on his\r\ndisability (high blood pressure and atrial fibrillation), in\r\nviolation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C.\r\n12101-12213 (1994).  The district court granted GD's motion for\r\nsummary judgment.  The court found that Hodgens's leave was not\r\nprotected under the FMLA because he did not have a \"serious health\r\ncondition,\" as required by the Act.  29 U.S.C.  2612(a)(1)(D). \r\nAnd the court rejected his ADA claim on the ground that his medical\r\ncondition, after taking account of mitigating treatment, did not\r\nconstitute a disability within the meaning of the ADA.  42 U.S.C.\r\n12102(2)(A).  Although we rely on different reasoning, we affirm\r\nthe grant of summary judgment.\r\n                          Facts\r\nWe recount the facts and draw all reasonable inferences\r\nin the light most favorable to Hodgens, as we must when we review\r\na grant of summary judgment. See DeNovellis v. Shalala, 124 F.3d\r\n298, 306 (1st Cir. 1997).  From 1964 until 1985, Hodgens worked for\r\nGeneral Dynamics at its Quincy, Massachusetts location.  The\r\nfacility was closed and Hodgens was laid off in 1985.  In\r\napproximately February 1988, General Dynamics hired Hodgens as a\r\nSenior Planner at its Quonset Point (R.I.) facility.  He worked in\r\nthe program planning area until September 1991.  \r\nHis performance was evaluated quite highly during his\r\nyears in program planning.  GD's evaluation system (as applied to\r\nhis positions with the company) consisted of an annual ranking,\r\ncovering the period beginning March 1 of one year through the end\r\nof February of the next.  Similarly situated employees (in the same\r\nor similar job titles, pay grades, etc.) were placed in \"peer\" or\r\n\"rank\" groups and then numerically \"ranked\" based on performance. \r\nThe employees in a particular rank group were evaluated by all\r\nsupervisors of such employees, at a meeting where performance was\r\ndiscussed and rankings determined by consensus.  During the three\r\nyears in which Hodgens worked in program planning, he was ranked\r\nfirst (among four or five) in his peer group.\r\nIn September 1991, the program planning function at\r\nQuonset Point was eliminated and Hodgens was reassigned to the\r\nproduction control area, where he worked until his termination in\r\nJuly 1994.  Unlike program planning   where Hodgens had tracked\r\ncosts and performed a data auditing function, not requiring a deep\r\nknowledge of construction procedures   production control was\r\n\"hands on\" work, requiring familiarity with the details of\r\nsubmarine hull and components manufacturing.  Because Hodgens had\r\nnot previously done this type of work, he was at a disadvantage\r\nrelative to his co-workers who did have such experience.  As a\r\nresult, Hodgens's performance fell.  In 1992, he was ranked eighth\r\nof ten; the employees who ranked ninth and tenth were laid off that\r\nyear as part of a reduction in force (\"RIF\").  In 1993, Hodgens\r\nranked seventh of eleven in his rank group.  Hodgens was concerned\r\nabout his performance in production control, and especially worried\r\nabout the possibility that his low performance might lead to his\r\nbeing laid off if there were to be another RIF.\r\nFor his first two years in production control, Hodgens\r\nperformed sound dampening functions (a process by which submarines\r\nare soundproofed).  He performed this part of his duties in a\r\nsatisfactory manner; his last evaluation covering the period 1993-\r\n94 stated that he did an \"excellent job in sound dampening.\"  At\r\nsome point during this period, however, GD decided to change its\r\nemployees' responsibilities from specializing in a particular\r\nfunction to include all aspects of a project.  Hodgens was assigned\r\nto \"Module 82,\" an area on the Seawolf submarine.  His duties\r\nincluded monitoring and facilitating the work on the module,\r\nfilling work orders, maintaining proper material flow, and solving\r\nproduction problems.  He worked on Module 82 between April and the\r\nbeginning of August 1993.  \r\nIt was during this period that Hodgens began to\r\nexperience medical problems, including chest pains, visual\r\nproblems, and profuse perspiration.  These began in approximately\r\nJune or July 1993.  On August 4, he began to see his doctor, Dr.\r\nJoanne Wilkinson.  She was \"most concerned\" that his symptoms,\r\ncoupled with his history of hypertension (high blood pressure or\r\nHBP), might indicate that he was suffering from angina, which could\r\nbe extremely serious or even fatal.  She therefore advised Hodgens\r\nto undergo a stress test and an electrocardiogram (EKG).  Dr.\r\nWilkinson continued to see Hodgens on frequent occasions throughout\r\nAugust, during which time she was unable either to make a diagnosis\r\nor to rule out angina.  During some of these visits, Hodgens's\r\nblood pressure was \"way up,\" and Dr. Wilkinson continued to treat\r\nHodgens as if he had angina.\r\nDuring the period of these visits, from August 4 until\r\nSeptember 27, Hodgens did not return to work.  According to him,\r\nthis was because of his need for numerous visits to Dr. Wilkinson\r\nand other physicians for evaluation and treatment, and because he\r\nwanted to be sure he did not do anything that might aggravate any\r\npotential heart condition.  Dr. Wilkinson testified at her\r\ndeposition that she thought it was \"reasonable\" for Hodgens to stay\r\nhome from work until he got the results of his stress test,\r\nalthough, if her patient had wanted to return to work during the\r\ninterim, she would have been \"comfortable\" with that.\r\nDr. Wilkinson also treated Hodgens for hypertension,\r\nprescribing a combination of medications, and for acute anxiety\r\nreactions.  As part of the treatment for the latter, Dr. Wilkinson\r\nreferred Hodgens to a psychologist for counseling to help reduce\r\nhis stress.  According to Hodgens's testimony, he had never\r\npreviously experienced the degree of stress that he experienced in\r\nModule 82.  Dr. Wilkinson also referred Hodgens to Dr. Jacobs, an\r\nophthalmologist, because of his visual problems.  Dr. Jacobs\r\ndetermined that he was suffering from migraine auras.\r\nOn September 13, 1993, Dr. Wilkinson told Hodgens that\r\nthe results of his EKG, MRI and stress test were normal.  She was\r\nable to rule out a stroke or a serious neurological problem, but\r\nshe was still unable to rule out the possibility of angina. \r\nNevertheless, she cleared Hodgens to return to work as of September\r\n20.  He did not return on that day, however, because he felt ill in\r\nhis car and had to return home.  He did return to work on September\r\n21.  As a matter of General Dynamics policy, GD's company nurse had\r\nto examine any employee, such as Hodgens, who had been out of work\r\nfor more than five days because of illness.  During her\r\nexamination, the nurse detected that Hodgens was experiencing\r\natrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) and that his blood\r\npressure was elevated.  She therefore refused to allow him to\r\nreturn to work and suggested that he see his doctor immediately.\r\nHodgens did so, and Dr. Wilkinson diagnosed him as\r\nsuffering from atrial fibrillation, a serious and potentially life-\r\nthreatening heart condition.  After treating him, by prescribing\r\nmedication to thin his blood in order to prevent a stroke, Dr.\r\nWilkinson told Hodgens he could return to work on September 27. \r\nShe restricted him to working half-days during the first week, and\r\nto working a light-duty schedule for the following three weeks.\r\nHodgens returned to work on September 27.  General\r\nDynamics changed his assignment so that he was no longer part of a\r\nmodule; according to GD, Module 82 was nearing completion. \r\nInstead, until December 1993, Hodgens was assigned exclusively to\r\nperforming sound dampening tasks.\r\nShortly thereafter, Hodgens had to take additional\r\nintermittent medical leave to deal with an ear problem.  His\r\nhearing problem manifested itself on September 29, 1993, and he saw\r\na physician six times in three months.  On January 7, 1994, he had\r\near surgery on an outpatient basis.  The surgery left him dizzy and\r\nfatigued; in order to recuperate, he required medication and bed\r\nrest for several days.  He returned to work on January 11.  In\r\nFebruary, he was assigned to the machine shop (GD says this was in\r\nMarch).  Here, his duties were, according to Hodgens, \"low-level,\r\ndemeaning, and not the type normally performed by Senior Planners.\" \r\nHe was no longer performing sound dampening duties.  Instead,\r\nanother employee was assigned to those duties, an employee who\r\nHodgens claims was less experienced and less qualified to perform\r\nthem.\r\nIn April 1994, Hodgens asked his new supervisor for\r\nvacation leave to handle a family emergency.  His supervisor\r\nresponded that he was taking \"too much time off,\" and issued a\r\nverbal warning about his attendance.  \r\nOn May 10, Hodgens met with his former supervisor, and\r\nreceived his annual evaluation covering the period March 1993\r\nthrough February 1994.  The evaluation contained the statement: \r\n\"Make every effort to have your absenteeism fall within the company\r\nguidelines.\"\r\nAt the same May 10 meeting, the supervisor told him he\r\nwas being laid off for lack of work, effective July 8, 1994.  His\r\nperformance had been ranked seventh among seven members of his rank\r\ngroup for the year ending February 1994. \r\nHodgens brought suit in district court, alleging that his\r\ntermination violated the FMLA because it was an adverse action\r\ntaken on the basis of his having availed himself of protected\r\nleave.  He also alleged that it violated the ADA because it was\r\nbased on his disabilities.  General Dynamics filed a motion for\r\nsummary judgment, contending that Hodgens failed to establish a\r\nprima facie case under the FMLA because he did not suffer from a\r\n\"serious health condition.\"  GD also argued that Hodgens is not\r\nprotected by the ADA because his conditions did not constitute a\r\n\"disability.\"  The district court granted GD's motion.  According\r\nto the court, \"an employee's absence [from work] must be necessary\r\nto enable the employee to receive treatment.  If an employee can\r\nobtain treatment without missing work, any period of absence cannot\r\nbe attributed to the need to receive treatment.\"  As for the ADA,\r\nthe court held that, taking into account the ameliorative effects\r\nof Hodgens's medications, his medical conditions did not constitute\r\na disability under the ADA.\r\n                            I\r\nWe review grants of summary judgment de novo.  Dubois v.\r\nUnited States Dep't of Agric., 102 F.3d 1273, 1283 (1st Cir. 1996),\r\ncert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 2510 (1997).  Summary judgment is\r\nappropriate when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to\r\ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the\r\naffidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any\r\nmaterial fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment\r\nas a matter of law.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\r\n\"'The very mission of the summary judgment procedure is\r\nto pierce the pleadings and to assess the proof in order to see\r\nwhether there is a genuine need for trial.'\"  DeNovellis, 124 F.3d\r\nat 305-6 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e) advisory committee's note\r\nto 1963 Amendment).  The moving party \"bears the initial\r\nresponsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its\r\nmotion, and identifying those portions of [the record] which it\r\nbelieves demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material\r\nfact.\"  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).  Once\r\nthe moving party has properly supported its motion for summary\r\njudgment, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party, with respect to\r\neach issue on which he has the burden of proof, to demonstrate that\r\na trier of fact reasonably could find in his favor.  Id. at 322-25. \r\nAt this stage, the nonmoving party \"may not rest upon mere\r\nallegation or denials of [the movant's] pleading, but must set\r\nforth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue\" of\r\nmaterial fact as to each issue upon which he would bear the\r\nultimate burden of proof at trial.  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby,\r\nInc., 477 U.S. 242, 256 (1986); see Celotex, 477 U.S. at 321-23.  \r\n                            II\r\nBecause our circuit has not previously had occasion to\r\nconsider the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, we set forth\r\nsome background at the outset.  \"The FMLA was enacted to help\r\nworking men and women balance the conflicting demands of work and\r\npersonal life.  It does so by recognizing that there will be times\r\nin a person's life when that person is incapable of performing her\r\nduties for medical reasons.\"  Price v. City of Fort Wayne, 117 F.3d\r\n1022, 1024 (7th Cir. 1997).\r\nThe twin purposes of the FMLA are to \"balance the demands\r\nof the workplace with the needs of families\" and \"to entitle\r\nemployees to take reasonable leave for medical reasons.\"  29 U.S.C.\r\n2601(b)(1) &amp; (2).  Among the findings prompting the Act was\r\nCongress's belief that \"there is inadequate job security for\r\nemployees who have serious health conditions that prevent them from\r\nworking for temporary periods.\"  29 U.S.C.  2601(a)(4).  The FMLA\r\nseeks to accomplish its purposes \"in a manner that accommodates the\r\nlegitimate interests of employers.\"  29 U.S.C.  2601(b)(3).\r\nThe FMLA contains two distinct types of provisions. \r\nFirst, it creates a series of substantive rights.  Eligible\r\nemployees \"shall be entitled\" to up to twelve weeks of unpaid leave\r\nper year for any one of the following purposes:  when the employee\r\nhas \"a serious health condition that makes [him or her] unable to\r\nperform the functions of [his or her] position,\" 29 U.S.C. \r\n2612(a)(1)(D); to care for a close family member with such a\r\ncondition, 29 U.S.C.  2612(a)(1)(C); or because of the birth,\r\nadoption, or placement in foster care of a child, 29 U.S.C. \r\n2612(a)(1)(A) &amp; (B).  See also 29 U.S.C.  2611(11); 29 C.F.R. \r\n825.100(a), 825.114 (1997) (defining a \"serious health condition\"). \r\nFollowing a qualified absence, the employee is entitled to return\r\nto the same position or an alternate position with equivalent pay,\r\nbenefits, and working conditions, and without loss of accrued\r\nseniority.  29 U.S.C.  2614(a)(1); 29 C.F.R.  825.100(c) (1997). \r\nThe FMLA also provides for \"intermittent\" leave, which allows an\r\nemployee to take such leave intermittently \"when medically\r\nnecessary,\" such as to attend appointments with a health care\r\nprovider for necessary treatment of a serious health condition.  29\r\nU.S.C.  2612(b); 29 C.F.R.  825.117 (1997) (defining requirements\r\nfor intermittent leave).\r\nThese rights are essentially prescriptive, \"set[ting]\r\nsubstantive floors\" for conduct by employers, and creating\r\n\"entitlements\" for employees.  Diaz v. Fort Wayne Foundry Corp.,\r\n131 F.3d 711, 712-13 (7th Cir. 1997).  As to these rights,\r\ntherefore, the employee need not show that the employer treated\r\nother employees less favorably, and an employer may not defend its\r\ninterference with the FMLA's substantive rights on the ground that\r\nit treats all employees equally poorly without discriminating.  Id.at 712.  In such cases, the employer's subjective intent is not\r\nrelevant.  The issue is simply whether the employer provided its\r\nemployee the entitlements set forth in the FMLA   for example, a\r\ntwelve-week leave or reinstatement after taking a medical leave. \r\nBecause the issue is the right to an entitlement, the employee is\r\ndue the benefit if the statutory requirements are satisfied,\r\nregardless of the intent of the employer.\r\nIn addition to creating the above entitlements, the FMLA\r\nprovides protection in the event an employee is discriminated\r\nagainst for exercising those rights.  See 29 U.S.C.  2615(a)(1)\r\n&amp; (2); 29 C.F.R.  825.220 (1997).  In particular, \"[a]n employer\r\nis prohibited from discriminating against employees . . . who have\r\nused FMLA leave.\"  29 C.F.R.  220(c).  Nor may employers \"use the\r\ntaking of FMLA leave as a negative factor in employment actions,\r\nsuch as hiring, promotions or disciplinary actions.\"  29 C.F.R.\r\n825.220(c).  For any such violation, the employer is subject to\r\na claim for compensatory damages and, unless the court finds the\r\nviolation occurred in good faith, additional liquidated damages. \r\n29 U.S.C.  2617(a)(1)(A).  These provisions are essentially\r\nproscriptive.\r\nIt is this proscriptive group of violations of the Act\r\nthat is at issue in the present case.  Hodgens claims that his\r\ntermination violated the FMLA because it was prompted by the fact\r\nthat he took sick leave to which he was entitled under the statute. \r\nIn such a case, the employer's motive is relevant, and the issue is\r\nwhether the employer took the adverse action because of a\r\nprohibited reason or for a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason. \r\nSuch issues are analogous to those raised in cases involving other\r\ntypes of discrimination, such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act\r\nof 1964, 42 U.S.C.  2000e through 2000e-17.  In such cases, courts\r\nhave created a framework for analyzing the tricky issue of\r\nmotivation.  See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792,\r\n800-06 (1973) (discrimination under Title VII); DeNovellis, 124\r\nF.3d at 308 (under ADEA); Katz v. City Metal Co., 87 F.3d 26, 30\r\nn.2 (1st Cir. 1996) (under ADA).  Some of our sister circuit courts\r\nhave applied this framework to the proscriptive portion of the\r\nFMLA, but not to claims under the prescriptive portion of the Act. \r\nSee, e.g., Diaz, 131 F.3d at 712-13; Morgan v. Hilti, Inc., 108\r\nF.3d 1319, 1323 (10th Cir. 1997).  We follow that lead and hold\r\nthat, when there is no direct evidence of discrimination, the\r\nMcDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework applies to claims that\r\nan employee was discriminated against for availing himself of FMLA-\r\nprotected rights. \r\nMcDonnell Douglas allocates the burdens of production and\r\npersuasion in accordance with a three-step procedure.  SeeMcDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802-04.  Under that framework, a\r\nplaintiff employee must carry the initial burden of coming forward\r\nwith sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of\r\ndiscrimination or retaliation.  McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802;\r\nsee Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 252-\r\n53 (1981).  If he does so, then the burden shifts to the employer\r\n\"to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the\r\nemployee's [termination],\" sufficient to raise a genuine issue of\r\nfact as to whether it discriminated against the employee. \r\nMcDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802; see Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253. \r\nThe employer \"must clearly set forth, through the introduction of\r\nadmissible evidence, the reasons for the [employee's termination]. \r\nThe explanation provided must be legally sufficient to justify a\r\njudgment for the [employer].\"  Burdine, 450 U.S. at 255.  If the\r\nemployer's evidence creates a genuine issue of fact, the\r\npresumption of discrimination drops from the case, and the\r\nplaintiff retains the ultimate burden of showing that the\r\nemployer's stated reason for terminating him was in fact a pretext\r\nfor retaliating against him for having taken protected FMLA leave. \r\nMcDonnell Douglas at 804; Burdine, 450 U.S. at 257; St. Mary's\r\nHonor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 511 (1993).  While a\r\nsatisfactory evidentiary explanation by the employer for its\r\nactions destroys the legally mandatory inference of discrimination\r\narising from the employee's prima facie case, the evidence and\r\ninferences that properly can be drawn from the evidence presented\r\nduring the employee's prima facie case may be considered in\r\ndetermining whether the employer's explanation is pretextual. \r\nHicks, 509 U.S. at 511; see also infra at 36-38 (discussing various\r\nways in which the employee might meet his burden of demonstrating\r\npretext).\r\nTo make out a prima facie case of retaliation, Hodgens\r\nmust show that (1) he availed himself of a protected right under\r\nthe FMLA; (2) he was adversely affected by an employment decision;\r\n(3) there is a causal connection between the employee's protected\r\nactivity and the employer's adverse employment action.  SeeRandlett v. Shalala, 118 F.3d 857, 862 (1st Cir. 1997); Hilti,\r\nInc., 108 F.3d at 1324.  \r\n                           III\r\nWe will follow McDonnell Douglas's three-step process in\r\nanalyzing Hodgens's claim   that his termination violated the FMLA\r\nbecause it was prompted by the fact that he took sick leave to\r\nwhich he was entitled under the statute.  The first step in our\r\nanalysis is to determine whether Hodgens has satisfied all three\r\nelements of his prima facie case.  There is no dispute as to the\r\nsecond element:  his termination was an adverse action.  General\r\nDynamics disputes the first and third elements of Hodgens's prima\r\nfacie case.\r\n                            A\r\nGeneral Dynamics asserts that Hodgens has failed to\r\nsatisfy the first element of his prima facie case.  It contends\r\nthat his absences were not protected by the FMLA for two\r\nalternative reasons.\r\n                            1\r\nFirst, according to GD, Hodgens was not even entitled to\r\nmedical leave under the FMLA because he did not suffer from a\r\n\"serious health condition\" as the statute requires.  The district\r\ncourt granted summary judgment to General Dynamics largely on this\r\nbasis.  For the reasons set forth below, we hold that Hodgens did\r\nsuffer from a \"serious health condition\" within the meaning of the\r\nFMLA. \r\nThe FMLA entitles an employee to twelve workweeks of\r\nleave during any twelve-month period \"[b]ecause of a serious health\r\ncondition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions\r\nof the position of such employee.\"  29 U.S.C.  2612(a)(1)(D).  The\r\nAct defines a \"serious health condition\" as \r\nan illness, injury, impairment, or physical or\r\nmental condition that involves:\r\n\n(A) inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or\r\nresidential medical care facility; or\r\n\n(B) continuing treatment by a health care\r\nprovider.\r\n\n29 U.S.C.  2611(11).  Hodgens does not argue that he received any\r\ninpatient care for his condition; thus,  2611(11)(A) does not\r\napply.  He does, however, contend that his visits to Dr. Wilkinson\r\nconstituted \"continuing treatment by a health care provider.\"  \r\nUnder the applicable Department of Labor regulations,\r\n\n825.114 (a) For purposes of FMLA, \"serious\r\nhealth condition\" means an illness, injury,\r\nimpairment, or physical or mental condition\r\nthat involves:\r\n\n. . .\r\n\n     (2) Any period of incapacity requiring\r\nabsence from work, school, or other regular\r\ndaily activities, of more than three calendar\r\ndays, that also involves continuing treatment\r\nby (or under the supervision of) a health care\r\nprovider; or\r\n\n     (3) Continuing treatment by (or under\r\nthe supervision of) a health care provider for\r\na chronic or long-term health condition that\r\nis incurable or so serious that, if not\r\ntreated, would likely result in a period of\r\nincapacity of more than three calendar days;\r\nor for prenatal care.\r\n\n(b) \"Continuing treatment by a health care\r\nprovider\" means one or more of the following:\r\n\n     (1) The employee or family member in\r\nquestion is treated two or more times for the\r\ninjury or illness by a health care provider. \r\nNormally this would require visits to the\r\nhealth care provider or to a nurse or\r\nphysician's assistant under direct supervision\r\nof the health care provider.\r\n\n     (2) The employee or family member is\r\ntreated for the injury or illness two or more\r\ntimes by a provider of health care services\r\n(e.g., physical therapist) under orders of, or\r\non referral by, a health care provider, or is\r\ntreated for the injury or illness by a health\r\ncare provider on at least one occasion which\r\nresults in a regimen of continuing treatment\r\nunder the supervision of the health care\r\nprovider   for example, a course of medication\r\nor therapy   to resolve the health condition.\r\n\n     (3) The employee or family member is\r\nunder the continuing supervision of, but not\r\nnecessarily being actively treated by, a\r\nhealth care provider due to a serious long-\r\nterm or chronic condition or disability which\r\ncannot be cured.  Examples include persons\r\nwith Alzheimer's, persons who have suffered a\r\nsevere stroke, or persons in the terminal\r\nstages of a disease who may not be receiving\r\nactive medical treatment.\r\n\n29 C.F.R.  825.114(a) &amp; (b) (1993).  \r\nHodgens suffered from numerous symptoms in July and\r\nAugust 1993.  Dr. Wilkinson examined him and, concerned about\r\nangina and its serious implications, ordered a series of tests\r\ndirected toward diagnosing the cause and nature of his problem,\r\nwith a view toward prescribing treatment (which she eventually did,\r\nalthough she never was able to rule out angina).  Then between\r\nSeptember 22 and 27, Hodgens was diagnosed with atrial\r\nfibrillation, and again was required to make many visits to Dr.\r\nWilkinson's office.  This latter period constituted more than three\r\nconsecutive days' worth of absences from work for a serious health\r\ncondition.  And these absences were medically necessary:  Hodgens's\r\ntreating physician, Dr. Wilkinson, filled out a work-restriction\r\nform   at the top of which appeared the date September 22   stating\r\nSeptember 27 as the date on which Hodgens could return to work. \r\nDr. Wilkinson's form carries the inference that that entire period\r\nof absence was medically necessary, and GD nowhere rebuts that\r\ninference.  Indeed, on September 21, GD's own nurse refused to let\r\nHodgens return to work at least in part because of his atrial\r\nfibrillation.  Thus, we cannot accept GD's claim, based on Dr.\r\nWilkinson's initially clearing Hodgens to return to work on\r\nSeptember 20, that Hodgens's health condition did not prevent him\r\nfrom working within the meaning of the FMLA during the period\r\nSeptember 22-27. \r\nAt least the September 22-27 diagnosis and treatment\r\nprogram met the three day requirement of 29 C.F.R.  825.114(a)(2)\r\n(1993), as long as there was continuing treatment under\r\n825.114(b).  Hodgens clearly satisfied the requirements of\r\n825.114(b)(1), at least sufficient to satisfy summary judgment,\r\nbecause he had two or more treatments by a health care provider. \r\nHe also fits within  825.114(b)(2) because he had seen a physician\r\nat least once and been placed on a treatment regimen of medication. \r\nSee Price v. Marathon Cheese Corp., 119 F.3d 330, 335 (5th Cir.\r\n1997). \r\nGeneral Dynamics argues that many of Hodgens's earlier\r\nabsences were not covered by the FMLA because \"Dr. Wilkinson was\r\nnever able to diagnose precisely what caused [Hodgens's] symptoms.\" \r\nDef. Br. at 22.  It seems unlikely that Congress intended to punish\r\npeople who are unlucky enough to develop new diseases, or to suffer\r\nserious symptoms for some period of time before the medical\r\nprofession is able to diagnose the cause of the problem.  Indeed,\r\none reason for taking \"intermittent leave\" under the FMLA would be\r\nto visit the doctor for purposes of diagnosis and treatment, even\r\nif the employee does not take leave for the periods in between such\r\nvisits.  It would seem that Congress intended to include visits to\r\na doctor when the employee has symptoms that are eventually\r\ndiagnosed as constituting a serious health condition, even if, at\r\nthe time of the initial medical appointments, the illness has not\r\nyet been diagnosed nor its degree of seriousness determined.  The\r\nLabor Department's final regulations support this interpretation: \r\n\"Treatment for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section [defining\r\n'serious health condition' in terms of 'treatment' received, inter\r\nalia] includes (but is not limited to) examinations to determine if\r\na serious health condition exists and evaluations of the\r\ncondition.\"  29 C.F.R.  825.114(b) (1997) (emphasis added).  Thus,\r\nas long as Hodgens satisfied, at some point in time, the \"more than\r\nthree consecutive days\" requirement for establishing a serious\r\nhealth condition, his intermittent absences for less than four days\r\n(even for portions of one day) were protected under the FMLA if\r\nthey were necessary \"to determine if a serious health condition\r\nexists,\" id., or to treat such a condition.  This is true even if\r\nthe intermittent absences occurred before the consecutive absences.\r\nIn addition to  825.114(a)(2), Hodgens fits within\r\n825.114(a)(3).  If not treated, Hodgens's illness could have led\r\nto a lot more absences from work, or could even have proved fatal,\r\nthus bringing him within the ambit of  825.114(a)(3).  Subsection\r\n(a)(3) also requires him to meet the definition of continuing\r\ntreatment under one of the subsections of  825.114(b).  As noted\r\nsupra, he clearly satisfied the requirements of subsections (b)(1)\r\nand (b)(2), at least sufficient to survive summary judgment.  With\r\nall inferences taken in his favor, the issue is trialworthy, i.e.,\r\na trier of fact could find that he met all statutory requirements\r\nto show that he did suffer from a \"serious health condition,\" and\r\nso his medically necessary leave was protected by the FMLA to the\r\nextent it was necessitated by that condition.\r\n                            2\r\nThe district court's alternative reason for rejecting\r\nHodgens's FMLA claim is that \"there is no evidence that [his\r\nhealth] condition rendered him unable to perform the functions of\r\nhis position,\" as required in 29 U.S.C.  2612(a)(1)(D).  The court\r\ntherefore concluded that his absences were not protected conduct\r\nunder the FMLA.  We reject this contention as well.  The court\r\napparently read the statute to require Hodgens to be actually\r\nincapacitated, in the sense of medically too sick to work, for any\r\nabsence that was to be protected by the FMLA.\r\nWe disagree.  The statutory language   \"unable to\r\nperform\" his job   in 29 U.S.C.  2612(a)(1)(D) does not\r\nnecessarily mean that an employee's physical condition itself\r\n\"actually incapacitate[s]\" him and prevents him from working.  The\r\nstatute could also be read to protect absences from work for\r\nwhatever time the employee needs in order to be diagnosed and\r\ntreated for a serious medical condition.  Under this reading of the\r\nstatutory language, the employee may be found to be \"unable to\r\nperform\" his job if his medical appointments conflict with his work\r\n(and the other statutory requirements are met), even if he is not\r\n\"too sick to work.\"  The text of the statute does not specify which\r\nof these two interpretations of \"unable to perform\" (or any other)\r\nwas intended by Congress.\r\nIn determining which interpretation to adopt, we must\r\nconsider the fact that the FMLA is a remedial statute.  Cf. Arnoldv. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 136 F.3d 854, 861 (1st  Cir. 1998)\r\n(interpreting the Americans with Disabilities Act).  \"It is a\r\n'familiar canon of statutory construction that remedial\r\nlegislation,'\" such as the FMLA, \"should be construed broadly to\r\neffectuate its purposes.'\"  Id. (quoting Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389\r\nU.S. 332, 336 (1967)).  The fundamental purpose of the FMLA is \"to\r\nentitle employees to take reasonable leave for medical reasons,\" 29\r\nU.S.C.  2601(b)(2), \"to help working men and women balance the\r\nconflicting demands of work and personal life,\" City of Fort Wayne,\r\n117 F.3d at 1024.  This purpose is better served by adopting the\r\nbroader reading than by adopting the district court's more\r\nconstrained construction requiring physical incapacitation.  We\r\nhold that it will suffice if an employee is \"unable to perform\" his\r\njob because of the need to obtain medical treatment or a diagnosis;\r\nhe does not have to be physically unable to work.  \r\nThe legislative history of the FMLA supports this\r\nreading.  \r\nThe requirement that the employee be unable to\r\nperform his or her job functions does not mean\r\nin each instance that the employee must\r\nliterally be so physically and mentally\r\nincapacitated that he or she is generally\r\nunable to work. . . . [I]f the employee must\r\nbe physically absent from work from time to\r\ntime in order to receive the treatment, it\r\nfollows as a matter of common sense that the\r\nemployee is, during the time of the\r\ntreatments, temporarily \"unable to perform the\r\nfunctions of his or her position\" for purposes\r\nof [ 2612(a)(1)(D)] and therefore eligible\r\nfor leave for the time necessary to receive\r\nthe treatments.\r\n\nS. Rep. No. 103-3, pt. 1, at 25 (1993), reprinted in 1993\r\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 3, 27 (emphasis added); see id. at 29, 1993\r\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 31 (noting the \"general test that either the\r\nunderlying health condition or the treatment for it requires that\r\nthe employee be absent from work on a recurring basis or for more\r\nthan a few days for treatment or recovery\" (emphasis added)).\r\nOur interpretation is further buttressed by the\r\nDepartment of Labor's final regulations.  The final version of 29\r\nC.F.R.  825.114(a) (1997), like the corresponding interim\r\nregulation, defines \"serious health condition\" as involving\r\n(1) inpatient care or (2) continuing treatment.  Under the rubric\r\nof continuing treatment, the regulation describes \"incapacity\" as\r\n\"inability to work . . . due to the serious health condition,\r\ntreatment therefor, or recovery therefrom.\"  29 C.F.R.\r\n825.114(a)(2)(i) (emphasis added).  In a similar vein, 29 C.F.R.\r\n825.114(b) (1997) reads as follows:  \"Treatment for purposes of\r\nparagraph (a) of this section [defining 'serious health condition'\r\nin terms of 'treatment' received, inter alia] includes (but is not\r\nlimited to) examinations to determine if a serious health condition\r\nexists and evaluations of the condition\" (emphasis added).  See\r\nalso 29 C.F.R.  825.115 (1997) (\"An employee who must be absent\r\nfrom work to receive medical treatment for a serious health\r\ncondition is considered to be unable to perform the essential\r\nfunctions of the position during the absence for treatment.\").\r\nIt is thus apparent that the agency charged with\r\ninterpreting the FMLA   and filling in any gaps or ambiguities in\r\nthe Act   believed that the Act should be interpreted broadly\r\nenough to protect absences from work that are necessary for the\r\npurpose of having one's medical condition diagnosed and treated,\r\nsuch as those at issue here.  The agency did not interpret the\r\nstatutory language   that Hodgens's health condition render him\r\n\"unable to perform\" his work   as requiring him to be \"too sick to\r\nwork.\"  The agency's interpretation is entitled to deference.  SeeChevron, 467 U.S. at 843-44.  We hold that Hodgens's absences from\r\nwork were protected by the FMLA if they were required for the\r\ndiagnosis and treatment of his medical condition, as long as he\r\nsatisfied the other requirements for \"seriousness\"; it is not\r\nnecessary that the medical condition make him \"too sick to work\" on\r\na particular day in order for an absence on that day to be covered\r\nunder the statute.  We therefore reverse the district court's\r\nholding to the extent that it stated a contrary view.  The FMLA\r\nprotected Hodgens's absences whenever his health condition required\r\nhim to visit his physician rendering him unable to work during the\r\ntime it took to accomplish those visits.\r\n We conclude that Hodgens would be entitled to survive\r\nsummary judgment if a rational trier of fact could find that at\r\nleast four consecutive days' worth of Hodgens's absences were\r\nmedically necessary and therefore rendered him \"unable to perform\"\r\nhis job, within the meaning of 29 U.S.C.  2612(a)(1)(D), for those\r\ndays.  Because a rational juror could so find, we hold that at\r\nleast some of his leave was covered by the FMLA.  Therefore the\r\ndistrict court erred to the extent that it predicated its grant of\r\nsummary judgment on the ground that there was no FMLA-qualifying\r\nleave at issue.\r\n                            B\r\n Thus far, we have found that, at the summary judgment\r\nstage, Hodgens has satisfied the first element of his prima facie\r\ncase, by availing himself of a protected right under the FMLA,\r\nbecause at least some of the leave Hodgens took during 1993 and\r\n1994 was FMLA-related.  Nevertheless, GD argues that most of\r\nHodgens's absences were not in fact protected leave under the FMLA,\r\nand that it was these non-FMLA absences that motivated it to\r\nevaluate Hodgens unfavorably, plus the quality of his performance\r\nrelative to his peers. \r\n This argument goes to the third element of Hodgens's\r\nprima facie case:  whether he has made a sufficient showing of a\r\ncausal connection between his taking FMLA-protected leave and GD's\r\ndecision to include him in its RIF and therefore to terminate his\r\nemployment.  \r\n GD admits that Hodgens's supervisor warned him that he\r\nwas taking \"too much time off,\" and that this warning came shortly\r\nafter Hodgens had taken several days off for ear surgery.  GD also\r\nconcedes that its evaluation of Hodgens one month later advised him\r\nto \"make every effort to have [his] absenteeism fall within company\r\nguidelines.\"  Additionally, during its April 1994 RIF, GD decided\r\nwhich employees to lay off based on a ranking that considered\r\nHodgens's absentee rate, as well as his performance during prior\r\ntime periods and that performance was diminished in part due to\r\nHodgens's absences, some of which were FMLA-protected visits to Dr.\r\nWilkinson regarding his heart condition.  This is sufficient to\r\nmake out a prima facie case that Hodgens's absences were at least\r\none factor in his low performance evaluation and hence in his\r\ndismissal.\r\n The prima facie burden is \"quite easy to meet.\" \r\nVillanueva v. Wellesley College, 930 F.2d 124, 127 (1st Cir. 1991);\r\nsee Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253.  Therefore, for purposes of this\r\nsummary judgment motion   where all inferences are drawn in\r\nHodgens's favor   and in light of the relatively low threshold\r\nshowing necessary to establish a prima facie case, we conclude that\r\nHodgens has satisfied his burden as to the third element (causal\r\nconnection), as well as the other elements of his prima facie case.\r\n                            IV\r\n Having disposed of the challenge to the first step of the\r\nMcDonnell Douglas analysis (Hodgens's prima facie case), we turn\r\nnow to the remaining steps:  whether General Dynamics articulated\r\na legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Hodgens's\r\nemployment, and, if so, whether Hodgens has demonstrated, at least\r\nto the level of trialworthiness, that the reason was a pretext, and\r\nthat he was, in reality, discharged discriminatorily on the basis\r\nof his having availed himself of a right protected by the Act,\r\nnamely, the right to take medically necessary leave time.  We\r\nconclude that Hodgens failed to demonstrate that a reasonable trier\r\nof fact could find his inclusion in the RIF to be based on his\r\nhaving taken FMLA leave.\r\n                            A\r\n Even though Hodgens has established a prima facie case of\r\nretaliation, General Dynamics has articulated a legitimate\r\nnondiscriminatory reason for terminating him.  \r\n GD stated that Hodgens was transferred out of program\r\nplanning and eventually to Module 82 for legitimate business\r\nreasons, including a realignment of staff that resulted from\r\nearlier RIFs, i.e., from RIFs that preceded Hodgens's taking any\r\nFMLA-related medical leave.  GD has shown that its April 1994 RIF\r\nwas legitimate and economically necessary.  And GD has submitted\r\nevidence that Hodgens's performance in Module 82 was below par, in\r\nany event significantly lower than the performance of all similarly\r\nsituated Module 82 workers (project managers).  For present\r\npurposes, GD has sufficiently articulated a legitimate reason for\r\nits adverse actions against Hodgens.  \r\n                            B\r\nHodgens cannot and does not claim that an employer cannot\r\ntransfer employees from one department to another or reduce the\r\noverall size of its staff if there is a legitimate business reason\r\nto do so.  The FMLA certainly does not prevent such transfers or\r\nRIFs.  An employer is entitled to reduce and/or reorganize its\r\nstaff; efficiency is a legitimate goal.  But an employer may not\r\nuse its RIF/reorganization/improved-efficiency rationale as a\r\npretext to mask actual discrimination or retaliation; the mere\r\nincantation of the mantra of \"efficiency\" is not a talisman\r\ninsulating an employer from liability for invidious discrimination. \r\nSee McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804 (employer may not use an\r\nostensibly legitimate reason for an adverse action as a pretext for\r\ndiscrimination that is prohibited by statute);  29 U.S.C.\r\n2615(a); 29 C.F.R.  825.220; cf. INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919,\r\n944 (1983):  \"Convenience and efficiency are not the primary\r\nobjectives   or the hallmarks   of democratic government.\"  Nor are\r\nthey the objectives of public policy underlying statutes like the\r\nFMLA or the ADA.\r\n                            1\r\nThe competing considerations that underlie a pretext\r\nanalysis are especially problematical in a case like Hodgens's. \r\nUnder the McDonnell Douglas framework, in order to rebut the\r\npresumption that arises upon the establishment of a prima facie\r\ncase, the employer need only produce enough competent evidence\r\nwhich, if taken as true, would permit a rational factfinder to\r\nconclude that the challenged employment action was taken for a\r\n\"legitimate, nondiscriminatory  reason,\" Burdine, 450 U.S. at 254-\r\n55; accord Hicks, 509 U.S. at 509; Ruiz v. Posadas de San Juan\r\nAssocs., 124 F.3d 243, 248 (1st Cir. 1997).  GD has accomplished\r\nthis here by offering the testimony of its decision-making\r\nsupervisors that GD discharged Hodgens because of his performance\r\nand his non-FMLA absences, and that its decision ignored his FMLA-\r\nprotected absences.  \r\nAt this point, Hodgens must demonstrate that there is a\r\ntrialworthy issue of pretext.  If we were to permit GD's mere\r\nassertion of a legitimate reason to discharge Hodgens to insulate\r\nit against liability, then this employer could circumvent the anti-\r\ndiscrimination provisions of the FMLA (and of other statutes)\r\nsimply by making a unilateral decision to transfer the employee\r\n(Hodgens) to a new work station where he has low seniority and/or\r\nis unable to perform the new job as well as others who have been in\r\nthat position for a longer time.  That way, when a RIF occurs\r\n(another decision made solely by the employer), Hodgens, as a\r\nrecent transferee, would be the low person on the totem pole,\r\nwhether the order of termination proceeds based upon seniority in\r\nthe position or upon the quality of performance to date.  The\r\ndecision as to what basis to use in deciding who gets RIFed is, of\r\ncourse, also a decision made unilaterally by the employer.\r\nBecause of the availability of seemingly neutral\r\nrationales under which an employer can hide its discriminatory\r\nintent, and because of the difficulty of accurately determining\r\nwhether an employer's motive is legitimate or is a pretext for\r\ndiscrimination, there is reason to be concerned about the\r\npossibility that an employer could manipulate its decisions to\r\npurge employees it wanted to eliminate.  See Weldon v. Kraft, Inc.,\r\n896 F.2d 793, 798 (3d Cir. 1990) (Subjective evaluations of\r\nperformance \"are more susceptible of abuse and more likely to mask\r\npretext\" than objective job qualifications.) (internal quotation\r\nmarks omitted).  The law does not permit this.  Even if an\r\nemployer's actions and articulated reasons are facially neutral\r\n(e.g., a RIF), if in reality the employer acted for a prohibited\r\nreason (e.g., retaliation for exercising a protected right), then\r\nits asserted legitimate reason for the RIF and its ostensibly\r\nnondiscriminatory selection criteria as to who gets RIFed cannot\r\ninsulate it from liability.  As Judge Posner wrote in the context\r\nof ADA disability discrimination, \"[a] RIF is not an open sesame to\r\ndiscrimination against a disabled person.  Even if the employer has\r\na compelling reason wholly unrelated to the disabilities of any of\r\nits employees to reduce the size of its work force, this does not\r\nentitle it to use the occasion as a convenient opportunity to get\r\nrid of its disabled workers.\"  Matthews v. Commonwealth Edison Co.,\r\n128 F.3d 1194, 1195 (7th Cir. 1997) (citation omitted).  Nor can it\r\nbe an opportunity to get rid of workers who exercise their FMLA\r\nright to take medical leave for serious medical conditions.  See 29\r\nU.S.C.  2615(a).\r\nThis means that, where a plaintiff in a discrimination\r\ncase makes out a prima facie case and the issue becomes whether the\r\nemployer's stated nondiscriminatory reason is a pretext for\r\ndiscrimination, courts must be \"particularly cautious\" about\r\ngranting the employer's motion for summary judgment.  Stepanischenv. Merchants Despatch Transp. Corp., 722 F.2d 922, 928 (1st Cir.\r\n1983).  Of course, summary judgment is not \"'automatically\r\npreclude[d]'\" even in cases where elusive concepts such as motive\r\nor intent are at issue.  See DeNovellis, 124 F.3d at 306 (quoting\r\nValles Velazquez v. Chardon, 736 F.2d 831, 833 (1st Cir. 1984)). \r\n\"[I]f the non-moving party rests merely upon conclusory\r\nallegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation,\"\r\nsummary judgment may be appropriate even where intent is an issue. \r\nSmith v. Stratus Computer, Inc., 40 F.3d 11, 12 (1st Cir. 1994)\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted).  Where, however, the nonmoving\r\nparty has produced more than that, trial courts \"should 'use\r\nrestraint in granting summary judgment' where discriminatory animus\r\nis in issue.\"  DeNovellis, 124 F.3d at 306 (quoting Valles\r\nVelazquez, 736 F.2d at 833); see Stepanischen, 722 F.2d at 928. \r\nThe role of the trial judge at the summary judgment stage \"is not\r\n. . . to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter,\r\nbut to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.\" \r\nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 249.\r\nWe recognize that courts in other circuits have addressed\r\nsimilar FMLA claims and, \"[g]ranting [the] plaintiff the benefit of\r\nevery favorable inference,\" have concluded that \"the pattern of\r\nactions taken by [the] defendant precludes summary judgment\r\nconcerning [the] defendant's motivation.\"  Marx v. Schnuck Markets,\r\nInc., 76 F.3d 324, 329 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 116 S. Ct. 2552\r\n(1996) (finding a genuine issue of fact concerning retaliatory\r\nintent when the pattern of conduct began soon after the filing of\r\na charge and later culminated in actual discharge); see Monica v.\r\nNalco Chemical Co., No. CIV.A. 96-1286, 1996 WL 736946, at *2 (E.D.\r\nLa. 1996) (The fact that one of six absences that employer used as\r\na basis for terminating plaintiff for excessive absenteeism was an\r\nFMLA-covered absence creates genuine issue of material fact that\r\nhis discharge was in retaliation for the FMLA-covered leave.); cf.Victorelli, 128 F.3d at 187-88 (finding material issue of fact as\r\nto whether plaintiff suffered from a serious health condition);\r\nCity of Fort Wayne, 117 F.3d 1022, 1027 (7th Cir. 1997) (same);\r\nRhoads v. FDIC, 956 F. Supp. 1239, 1256 (D. Md. 1997) (same).  And\r\nwe have held likewise, in analogous contexts.  For example, in\r\nWynne v. Tufts Univ. Sch. of Med., 932 F.2d 19, 27-28 (1st Cir.\r\n1991) (en banc), we held that the record did not contain a\r\nsufficient showing on the movant's part to permit judgment as a\r\nmatter of law.  We determined that the movant (university) had to\r\ndemonstrate that its decision to dismiss the plaintiff (student)\r\n\"was a reasoned, professional . . . judgment, not a mere ipse\r\ndixit.\"  Id. at 27.  As a result, we \"set aside the summary\r\njudgment and remand[ed] th[e] issue for further proceedings.\"  Id.at 28; see Rossy v. Roche Prods., 880 F.2d 621, 626 (1st Cir. 1989)\r\n(\"All of [the employer's] explanations may in fact be accurate, but\r\nthey must be decided after trial, especially in cases such as this\r\nwhere [the employer's] intent is the central issue.\").  In those\r\ncases, the courts have left it to the trier of fact to assess\r\nwhether the evidence supported the legitimacy of the employer's\r\nstated reason or the employee's allegation of pretext.  \r\nOf course, those decisions, like all decisions to affirm\r\nor reverse grants of summary judgment, were fact-based.  In each\r\ncase, the issue was a factual question of motivation:  could a\r\nreasonable jury find that the adverse action was taken because of\r\nthe employee's protected conduct rather than because of other\r\nnondiscriminatory reasons? \r\nThe nonmoving plaintiff may demonstrate pretext either\r\nindirectly by showing that the employer's stated reasons for its\r\nadverse action were not credible, or directly by showing that that\r\naction was more likely motivated by a discriminatory reason.  SeeBurdine, 450 U.S. at 256.  Thus, one way an employee may succeed is\r\nto show \"such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies,\r\nincoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered\r\nlegitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder\r\ncould rationally find them unworthy of credence and [with or\r\nwithout additional evidence and inferences properly drawn\r\ntherefrom] infer that the employer did not act for the asserted\r\nnon-discriminatory reasons.\"  Hilti, Inc., 108 F.3d at 1323\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted); Weldon, 896 F.2d at 798 (courts\r\nshould be sensitive to myriad of ways such an inference can be\r\ncreated).  \r\nIn addition, close temporal proximity between two events\r\nmay give rise to an inference of causal connection.  Thus,\r\n\"protected conduct closely followed by adverse action may justify\r\nan inference of retaliatory motive.\"  Marx, 76 F.3d at 329; seeOliver v. Digital Equip. Corp., 846 F.2d 103, 110 (1st Cir. 1988)\r\n(\"A showing of discharge soon after the employee engages in an\r\nactivity specifically protected by . . .

Fruehauf Corp., 794 F.2d 598, 601 (11th Cir. 1986)\r\n(finding retaliatory pretext based, inter alia, upon employer's\r\nhaving discharged employee less than one month after her filing a\r\ndiscrimination charge); cf.

In addition,\r\n\"doubts about the fairness\" of an employer's decision or an\r\nemployer's \"'misjudg[ing]'\" of an employee's qualifications, while\r\nnot necessarily dispositive, \"'may be probative of whether the\r\nemployer's reasons are pretexts for discrimination.'\"  Ezold v.\r\nWolf, Block, Schorr &amp; Solis-Cohen, 983 F.2d 509, 531 (3d Cir. 1992)\r\n(quoting Burdine, 450 U.S. at 259).\r\n                            2\r\nApplying these principles, we must determine whether\r\nthere is sufficient evidence favoring Hodgens for \"a fair-minded\r\njury [to] return a verdict in his favor,\" Anderson, 477 U.S. at\r\n252, i.e., for a jury to conclude that Hodgens's discharge was\r\nmotivated by retaliation for his having availed himself of a right\r\nprotected by the FMLA, namely, the right to take medically\r\nnecessary leave time.  We have already examined, in a different\r\ncontext, GD's stated reasons for discharging Hodgens.  In Part\r\nIII(B), supra, we determined that Hodgens had produced sufficient\r\nevidence to satisfy the low threshold required to meet the third\r\nprong of his prima facie case, i.e., that there was a causal\r\nconnection between his protected medical leave and his losing his\r\njob.  Because GD has met Hodgens's prima facie case by articulating\r\nits facially nondiscriminatory reasons for terminating him, we must\r\nnow examine whether Hodgens has produced sufficient evidence for a\r\nrational jury to conclude that those reasons were a pretext for\r\ndiscrimination.\r\nBased on the record here, a rational jury could not reach\r\nsuch a conclusion.  It is undisputed that a number of Hodgens's\r\nproblems on the job took place long before he took his first\r\nmedical leave.  For example, in 1985, in a previous RIF, GD closed\r\ndown Hodgens's prior work site in Quincy altogether.  Hodgens was\r\nout of work for three years as a result.  After he was re-hired at\r\nthe Quonset Point facility and doing well for three years, the\r\nprogram planning function in which he was excelling was eliminated\r\nin 1991, resulting in his reassignment to production control.  This\r\nwas still two years before the onset of the medical conditions at\r\nissue in the present case, June 1993.  For the year beginning\r\nMarch 1, 1991, Hodgens's performance was ranked eighth out of ten\r\nemployees in his peer group, and the two employees who ranked\r\nbehind him were laid off that year as part of another RIF.  In the\r\nyear beginning March 1, 1992, Hodgens ranked seventh of eleven in\r\nhis rank group.  Hodgens's poor performance in the two years\r\npreceding his illness was a source of great concern to him,\r\nparticularly as it related to the possibility that he might become\r\nthe next casualty of GD's efficiency-related RIFs.  \r\nShortly before the first relevant manifestation of his\r\nheart problems, Hodgens was reassigned to work in Module 82, where\r\nhis performance problems became even worse.  He worked on Module 82\r\nbetween April and early August 1993.  Thus, even without parsing\r\nthe competing evidence as to which portions of Hodgens's poor\r\nperformance on Module 82 were related or unrelated to the absences\r\ncaused by his HBP and his potential heart condition, we note that\r\nall of the foregoing events   putting Hodgens in an extremely\r\nunfavorable position at work   occurred prior to his taking any\r\nFMLA-protected medical leave.  This is obvious with respect to the\r\nperiod prior to his being assigned to Module 82; and it also\r\napplies to his poor performance in Module 82 between April and\r\nAugust 1993, which preceded his FMLA-protected leave.  So none of\r\nthese events could have been motivated by Hodgens's having taken\r\nFMLA-protected leave. \r\nFurther, Hodgens failed to submit any evidence, direct or\r\ncircumstantial, that General Dynamics's well-justified and\r\ndocumented decision to lay off more workers in April 1994 was a\r\nmere pretext for retaliation against Hodgens for exercising his\r\nright to take medical leave.  On the contrary, the RIF itself seems\r\nreal enough and the legitimate business need for it remains\r\nunshaken.  There were RIFs before Hodgens became ill, and there is\r\nno evidence that there was anything pretextual about GD's general\r\nbusiness strategy of reducing its work force in order to maintain\r\nits profit levels.  \r\nNevertheless, while the RIF as a whole appears\r\nlegitimate, there remains the question of whether GD's selection of\r\nHodgens in particular to be laid off was based in any way upon his\r\nhaving exercised his FMLA right to take necessary medical leave. \r\nGD presented evidence that Hodgens's ranking for the year beginning\r\nMarch 1, 1993 (including the period of his Module 82 position as\r\nwell as the period of his FMLA-protected absences, plus less than\r\none month in the machine shop to which he half-heartedly argues he\r\nwould not have been assigned if he had not taken FMLA leave) was\r\nbased on a comparison with those senior planners having similar\r\nduties, and that he ranked lowest among his peers in terms of\r\nperformance.  Hodgens himself told his doctor that he was\r\nexperiencing pressure at work because of a \"decrease in performance\r\nbecause of inexperience in [his] present job.\"\r\nIn order to overcome the weight of these facts, Hodgens\r\noffered the following evidence to dispute the legitimacy of GD's\r\nrationale for including him in the layoff, i.e., to show that it\r\nwas a mere pretext:  (1) shortly after he returned from a\r\nsignificant amount of FMLA-protected medical leave, his supervisor\r\ntold him he should do something to reduce his \"excessive absences\";\r\n(2) his evaluation contained the statement, \"Make every effort to\r\nhave your absenteeism fall within the company guidelines\"; (3) his\r\ntermination was based on the low performance evaluation which he\r\nreceived shortly after returning from his protected medical leave,\r\nand this temporal proximity bespeaks a retaliatory intent; and\r\n(4) a memorandum, entitled \"Justification Regarding Drop in Rank\r\nPosition,\" specifically acknowledged that his absentee rate was a\r\nfactor in his low performance rating and therefore in his\r\ntermination.  Thus, in the language of Arlington Heights, Hodgens\r\ncontends that the \"specific sequence of events\" leading up to his\r\ntermination, coupled with the contemporary statements by his\r\nsupervisor (written and oral) warning him about his \"excessive\r\nabsences,\" constitute proof that GD's decision to terminate him was\r\nmotivated by his having availed himself of FMLA-protected medical\r\nleave.  Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 267-68.  We will discuss\r\nthese facts seriatim although, in evaluating their sufficiency to\r\nwithstand summary judgment, we must consider them in combination,\r\nnot each standing alone.\r\nAs noted supra, close temporal proximity between two\r\nevents may give rise to an inference of causal connection. \r\nTherefore, \"it may be significant that [Hodgens's termination, and\r\nthe warning that preceded it, occurred] shortly after his having\r\ntaken FMLA leave.\"  Williams v. Shenango, Inc., 986 F. Supp. 309,\r\n322 (W.D. Pa. 1997) (denying summary judgment to employer because\r\na reasonable factfinder could find employer's articulated reasons\r\nfor suspending and terminating employee to be pretexts for\r\ndiscrimination based on having taken FMLA leave); see Marx, 76 F.3d\r\nat 329 (same).  \r\nWhile Hodgens is correct that temporal proximity may give\r\nrise to a \"suggest[ion] of retaliation,\" Oliver, 846 F.2d at 110,\r\nthat \"suggest[ion]\" is not necessarily conclusive.  We must\r\nremember that it is the employee's burden to show pretext,\r\nsufficient to survive summary judgment.  This is a question of\r\nfact, the resolution of which is usually left to the trier of fact. \r\nHere, the circumstantial fact of temporal proximity is\r\nweakened considerably by the history of GD's prior non-\r\ndiscriminatory RIFs and of Hodgens's poor work performance.  To\r\nstrengthen his case, Hodgens has produced evidence that his\r\nsupervisor specifically referred to his \"excessive absences\" and\r\nhis termination was based on an evaluation and justification memo\r\nreflecting the same concern.  According to Hodgens, these\r\ncontemporaneous statements by the decision-making authority (or its\r\nagent) demonstrate persuasively that GD's decision to rank him at\r\nthe bottom of his peer group and to choose him as the employee from\r\nthat group to lay off in the 1994 RIF were motivated by retaliatory\r\nanimus.  The inference is strengthened by the fact that Hodgens had\r\na good work history for three of the five years since he was\r\nrehired by GD at Quonset Point and for twenty years previously in\r\nQuincy.  On the other hand, the inference is weakened by his\r\nperformance problems over the two years prior to his taking FMLA-\r\nprotected medical leave, although it must be remembered that\r\nHodgens survived the earlier RIFs, even if only by the skin of his\r\nteeth.\r\nStatements by supervisors carrying the inference that the\r\nsupervisor harbored animus against protected classes of people or\r\nconduct are clearly probative of pretext, Kelley v. Airborne\r\nFreight Corp.,     F.3d    ,    , 1998 WL 150958, at *10-*11 (1st\r\nCir. April 7, 1998) (Remark that it would be a good time \"to get\r\nrid of some of the older mediocre managers\" had a \"direct bearing\r\non age discrimination.\"); EEOC v. G-K-G, Inc., 39 F.3d 740, 746\r\n(7th Cir. 1994) (Comment by supervisor that the plaintiff's\r\n\"accounts could use some younger blood\" constituted sufficient\r\ndirect evidence of discriminatory intent.); Lindahl v. Air France,\r\n930 F.2d 1434, 1439 (9th Cir. 1991) (Sexist comments reflecting the\r\nsupervisor's stereotypical images of men and women raised a genuine\r\nissue of fact with respect to pretext.); Morgan v.

Long Island Lighting Co., 933 F.2d 187, 192-\r\n93 (2d Cir. 1991) (Statement that plaintiff was overqualified for\r\nposition raised an issue of material fact with regard to pretext in\r\nan age discrimination case.).\r\nGD argues that the statements by Hodgens's supervisor are\r\nnot as damning as Hodgens would have us believe:  they refer only\r\nto his \"excessive absences,\" and GD has offered evidence that a\r\ngreat many of Hodgens's absences were not FMLA-protected.  Cf.Hilti, Inc., 108 F.3d at 1322, 1324-25 (finding no genuine issue\r\nregarding pretext where employee had a long history of excessive\r\nabsenteeism over the years, about which she had received several\r\nwarnings well before she took any FMLA-protected leave).  According\r\nto GD, the supervisor was primarily referring to non-protected\r\nabsences, rendering these statements a great deal less than a\r\n\"smoking gun.\"\r\nHodgens disputes the merits of GD's attempt to parse his\r\nabsences into FMLA-protected and non-FMLA-protected.  He argues\r\nthat it was not unreasonable for him to remain absent from work for\r\nmedical reasons during the entire period that he did, because\r\nduring this time his physician performed diagnostic tests in an\r\neffort to determine how serious his medical condition was and, if\r\nindeed it was heart-related, whether it would be safe for him to\r\nreturn to work before it was brought under control.  Dr. Wilkinson\r\nwas \"most concerned\" that his symptoms and history could indicate\r\nthat he was suffering from angina, which she was never able to rule\r\nout during the entire period of nearly two months that Hodgens was\r\nout of work.  If he was suffering from angina, then any stress,\r\nincluding work, would increase the chance that he could have a\r\nheart attack.  Similarly, his atrial fibrillation, if not treated\r\nproperly, could lead to a stroke.\r\nThe problem that Hodgens cannot overcome is that, while\r\nDr. Wilkinson may indeed have been concerned about his condition,\r\nshe did not tell him that his medical condition required him to\r\nstay home from work from August 4 through September 21, 1993.  To\r\nthe contrary, while she thought it was \"reasonable\" for Hodgens to\r\nwant to stay home from work pending the outcome of his tests, she\r\nin fact recommended that he return to work despite his medical\r\ncondition and its potential risks.  As GD notes, Hodgens could, for\r\nexample, have kept any given medical appointment in the morning,\r\nand then come back to work for the remainder of the day, which he\r\ndid do on some occasions but not on others.  Thus, apart from the\r\nperiod from September 22-27, while Hodgens's medical condition\r\nclearly did require him to be absent from work during the times\r\nnecessary for his medical visits, it did not require the vast\r\nmajority of his absences during August and September.  The\r\nremainder of his absences between August 4 and September 21 as well\r\nas after September 27 were therefore not protected by the FMLA, \r\ni.e., the time that was not actually necessary for him to attend\r\nmedical appointments related to his heart condition.  GD was not\r\nprecluded from taking those unprotected absences into account in\r\nevaluating Hodgens's performance and in determining whether to\r\ninclude Hodgens in the RIF.\r\n The question of summary judgment here is a close one\r\nbecause both GD and Hodgens have presented probative evidence\r\ntending to support their respective versions of the facts, on the\r\nquestion whether GD's reason for discharging Hodgens was legitimate\r\nor merely a pretext to retaliate against him for taking FMLA-\r\nprotected medical leave.  The weighing of such alternative factual\r\nscenarios would ordinarily be left to the finder of fact after\r\ntrial.  But on this record, the weight of the evidence does not\r\n\"present[] a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a\r\njury\"; it is \"so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter\r\nof law.\"  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 251-52.  No rational factfinder\r\ncould reasonably conclude that GD terminated Hodgens in retaliation\r\nfor exercising his rights under the statute:  the vast majority of\r\nHodgens's absences were not FMLA-protected; overwhelming evidence\r\ndemonstrated his poor performance, during two full years prior to\r\nhis protected medical leave plus during the portion of the 1993-94\r\nevaluation year that preceded his medical leave; and the evidence\r\nHodgens offered was simply insufficient to outweigh the foregoing,\r\nsuch that a factfinder could infer pretext.  Because \"a fair-minded\r\njury could [not] return a verdict for [Hodgens] on the evidence\r\npresented,\" Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252, we affirm the grant of\r\nsummary judgment on the FMLA claim.\r\n                            V\r\n Hodgens also makes a claim under the ADA.  We affirm the\r\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment on the ADA claim on the\r\nsame basis that we affirm on the FMLA claim.  Hodgens never\r\ndemonstrated, to the level of sufficiency required on a motion for\r\nsummary judgment, that GD's stated reason for terminating him   a\r\nRIF based on his performance   was a pretext for his asserted\r\ndisability.  Hodgens has certainly not made any more persuasive a\r\ndemonstration that his layoff was a pretext for discrimination\r\nbased on his disability than he did to show that it was a pretext\r\nfor retaliation based on his having taken FMLA leave.\r\n Therefore, his ADA claim must fail, and the grant of\r\nsummary judgment to General Dynamics must be affirmed, albeit on a\r\ndifferent basis than that relied upon by the district court.  We\r\nwill affirm a correct result reached by the court below \"on any\r\nindependently sufficient ground made manifest by the record.\" \r\nPalmacci v. Umpierrez, 121 F.3d 781, 792 (1st Cir. 1997); AIDS\r\nAction Comm. of Mass. v. MBTA, 42 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1994)\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted).  We need not decide whether the\r\ndistrict court was correct in holding that certain of Hodgens's\r\nmedical conditions (HBP and atrial fibrillation) did not constitute\r\na disability within the meaning of the ADA, and in particular,\r\nwhether deciding that issue should proceed with or without\r\nconsideration of Hodgens's ameliorative medications.  See Arnold,\r\n136 F.3d 854.\r\n The grant of summary judgment to General Dynamics is\r\nAffirmed.  No costs to either party.\n",

See DeNovellis v. Shalala, 124 F.3d 298, 306 (1st Cir.1997).  From 1964 until 1985, Hodgens worked for General Dynamics at its Quincy, Massachusetts location.  The facility was closed and Hodgens was laid off in 1985.  In approximately February 1988, General Dynamics hired Hodgens as a Senior Planner at its Quonset Point (R.I.) facility.  He worked in the program planning area until September 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">His performance was evaluated quite highly during his years in program planning.  GD's evaluation system (as applied to his positions with the company) consisted of an annual ranking, covering the period beginning March 1 of one year through the end of February of the next.  Similarly situated employees (in the same or similar job titles, pay grades, etc.) were placed in \"peer\" or \"rank\" groups and then numerically \"ranked\" based on performance.  The employees in a particular rank group were evaluated by all supervisors of such employees, at a meeting where performance was discussed and rankings determined by consensus.  During the three years in which Hodgens worked in program planning, he was ranked first (among four or five) in his peer group.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1991, the program planning function at Quonset Point was eliminated and Hodgens was reassigned to the production control area, where he worked until his termination in July 1994.  Unlike program planning--where Hodgens had tracked costs and performed a data auditing function, not requiring a deep knowledge of construction procedures--production control was \"hands on\" work, requiring familiarity with the details of submarine hull and components manufacturing.  Because Hodgens had not previously done this type of work, he was at a disadvantage relative to his co-workers who did have such experience.  As a result, Hodgens's performance fell.  In 1992, he was ranked eighth of ten;  the employees who ranked ninth and tenth were laid off that year as part of a reduction in force (\"RIF\").  In 1993, Hodgens ranked seventh of eleven in his rank group.  Hodgens was concerned about his performance in production control, and especially worried about the possibility that his low performance might lead to his being laid off if there were to be another RIF.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For his first two years in production control, Hodgens performed sound dampening functions (a process by which submarines are soundproofed).  He performed this part of his duties in a satisfactory manner;  his last evaluation covering the period 1993-94 stated that he did an \"excellent job in sound dampening.\"   At some point during this period, however, GD decided to change its employees' responsibilities from specializing in a particular function to include all aspects of a project.  Hodgens was assigned to \"Module 82,\" an area on the Seawolf submarine.  His duties included monitoring and facilitating the work on the module, filling work orders, maintaining proper material flow, and solving production problems.  He worked on Module 82 between April and the beginning of August 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was during this period that Hodgens began to experience medical problems, including chest pains, visual problems, and profuse perspiration.  These began in approximately June or July 1993.  On August 4, he began to see his doctor, Dr. Joanne Wilkinson.  She was \"most concerned\" that his symptoms, coupled with his history of hypertension (high blood pressure or HBP), might indicate that he was suffering from angina, which could be extremely serious or even fatal.  She therefore advised Hodgens to undergo a stress test and an electrocardiogram (EKG).  Dr. Wilkinson continued to see Hodgens on frequent occasions throughout August, during which time she was unable either to make a diagnosis or to rule out angina.  During some of these visits, Hodgens's blood pressure was \"way up,\" and Dr. Wilkinson continued to treat Hodgens as if he had angina.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the period of these visits, from August 4 until September 27, Hodgens did not return to work.  According to him, this was because of his need for numerous visits to Dr. Wilkinson and other physicians for evaluation and treatment, and because he wanted to be sure he did not do anything that might aggravate any potential heart condition.  Dr. Wilkinson testified at her deposition that she thought it was \"reasonable\" for Hodgens to stay home from work until he got the results of his stress test, although, if her patient had wanted to return to work during the interim, she would have been \"comfortable\" with that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Wilkinson also treated Hodgens for hypertension, prescribing a combination of medications, and for acute anxiety reactions.  As part of the treatment for the latter, Dr. Wilkinson referred Hodgens to a psychologist for counseling to help reduce his stress.  According to Hodgens's testimony, he had never previously experienced the degree of stress that he experienced in Module 82.  Dr. Wilkinson also referred Hodgens to Dr. Jacobs, an ophthalmologist, because of his visual problems.  Dr. Jacobs determined that he was suffering from migraine auras.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 13, 1993, Dr. Wilkinson told Hodgens that the results of his EKG, MRI and stress test were normal.  She was able to rule out a stroke or a serious neurological problem, but she was still unable to rule out the possibility of angina.  Nevertheless, she cleared Hodgens to return to work as of September 20.  He did not return on that day, however, because he felt ill in his car and had to return home.  He did return to work on September 21.  As a matter of General Dynamics policy, GD's company nurse had to examine any employee, such as Hodgens, who had been out of work for more than five days because of illness.  During her examination, the nurse detected that Hodgens was experiencing atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) and that his blood pressure was elevated.  She therefore refused to allow him to return to work and suggested that he see his doctor immediately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hodgens did so, and Dr. Wilkinson diagnosed him as suffering from atrial fibrillation, a serious and potentially life-threatening heart condition.  After treating him, by prescribing medication to thin his blood in order to prevent a stroke, Dr. Wilkinson told Hodgens he could return to work on September 27.  She restricted him to working half-days during the first week, and to working a light-duty schedule for the following three weeks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hodgens returned to work on September 27.  General Dynamics changed his assignment so that he was no longer part of a module;  according to GD, Module 82 was nearing completion.  Instead, until December 1993, Hodgens was assigned exclusively to performing sound dampening tasks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter, Hodgens had to take additional intermittent medical leave to deal with an ear problem.  His hearing problem manifested itself on September 29, 1993, and he saw a physician six times in three months.  On January 7, 1994, he had ear surgery on an outpatient basis.  The surgery left him dizzy and fatigued;  in order to recuperate, he required medication and bed rest for several days.  He returned to work on January 11.  In February, he was assigned to the machine shop (GD says this was in March).  Here, his duties were, according to Hodgens, \"low-level, demeaning, and not the type normally performed by Senior Planners.\"   He was no longer performing sound dampening duties.  Instead, another employee was assigned to those duties, an employee who Hodgens claims was less experienced and less qualified to perform them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1994, Hodgens asked his new supervisor for vacation leave to handle a family emergency.  His supervisor responded that he was taking \"too much time off,\" and issued a verbal warning about his attendance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 10, Hodgens met with his former supervisor, and received his annual evaluation covering the period March 1993 through February 1994.  The evaluation contained the statement:  \"Make every effort to have your absenteeism fall within the company guidelines.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same May 10 meeting, the supervisor told him he was being laid off for lack of work, effective July 8, 1994.  His performance had been ranked seventh among seven members of his rank group for the year ending February 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hodgens brought suit in district court, alleging that his termination violated the FMLA because it was an adverse action taken on the basis of his having availed himself of protected leave.  He also alleged that it violated the ADA because it was based on his disabilities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  General Dynamics filed a motion for summary judgment, contending that Hodgens failed to establish a prima facie case under the FMLA because he did not suffer from a \"serious health condition.\"   GD also argued that Hodgens is not protected by the ADA because his conditions did not constitute a \"disability.\"   The district court granted GD's motion.  According to the court, \"an employee's absence [from work] must be necessary to enable the employee to receive treatment.  If an employee can obtain treatment without missing work, any period of absence cannot be attributed to the need to receive treatment.\"   As for the ADA, the court held that, taking into account the ameliorative effects of Hodgens's medications, his medical conditions did not constitute a disability under the ADA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* We review grants of summary judgment de novo.

Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\" 'The very mission of the summary judgment procedure is to pierce the pleadings and to assess the proof in order to see whether there is a genuine need for trial.' \"  DeNovellis, 124 F.3d at 305-6 (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e) advisory committee's note to 1963 Amendment).

It does so by recognizing that there will be times in a person's life when that person is incapable of performing her duties for medical reasons.\"  Price v. City of Fort Wayne, 117 F.3d 1022, 1024 (7th Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The twin purposes of the FMLA are to \"balance the demands of the workplace with the needs of families\" and \"to entitle employees to take reasonable leave for medical reasons.\"  29 U.S.C. &#167; 2601(b)(1) &amp; (2).  Among the findings prompting the Act was Congress's belief that \"there is inadequate job security for employees who have serious health conditions that prevent them from working for temporary periods.\"  29 U.S.C. &#167; 2601(a)(4).  The FMLA seeks to accomplish its purposes \"in a manner that accommodates the legitimate interests of employers.\"  29 U.S.C. &#167; 2601(b)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FMLA contains two distinct types of provisions.  First, it creates a series of substantive rights.  Eligible employees \"shall be entitled\" to up to twelve weeks of unpaid leave per year for any one of the following purposes:  when the employee has \"a serious health condition that makes [him or her] unable to perform the functions of [his or her] position,\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 2612(a)(1)(D);  to care for a close family member with such a condition, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 2612(a)(1)(C);  or because of the birth, adoption, or placement in foster care of a child, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 2612(a)(1)(A) &amp; (B).  See also 29 U.S.C. &#167; 2611(11);  29 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 825.100(a), 825.114 (1997) (defining a \"serious health condition\").  Following a qualified absence, the employee is entitled to return to the same position or an alternate position with equivalent pay, benefits, and working conditions, and without loss of accrued seniority.  29 U.S.C. &#167; 2614(a)(1);  29 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 825.100(c) (1997).  The FMLA also provides for \"intermittent\" leave, which allows an employee to take such leave intermittently \"when medically necessary,\" such as to attend appointments with a health care provider for necessary treatment of a serious health condition.  29 U.S.C. &#167; 2612(b);  29 C.F.R. &#167; 825.117 (1997) (defining requirements for intermittent leave).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These rights are essentially prescriptive, \"set[ting] substantive floors\" for conduct by employers, and creating \"entitlements\" for employees.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Diaz v. Fort Wayne Foundry Corp., 131 F.3d 711, 712-13 (7th Cir.1997).  As to these rights, therefore, the employee need not show that the employer treated other employees less favorably, and an employer may not defend its interference with the FMLA's substantive rights on the ground that it treats all employees equally poorly without discriminating.  Id. at 712.   In such cases, the employer's subjective intent is not relevant.  The issue is simply whether the employer provided its employee the entitlements set forth in the FMLA--for example, a twelve-week leave or reinstatement after taking a medical leave.  Because the issue is the right to an entitlement, the employee is due the benefit if the statutory requirements are satisfied, regardless of the intent of the employer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to creating the above entitlements, the FMLA provides protection in the event an employee is discriminated against for exercising those rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  See 29 U.S.C. &#167;   2615(a)(1) &amp; (2);  29 C.F.R. &#167; 825.220 (1997).  In particular, \"[a]n employer is prohibited from discriminating against employees ... who have used FMLA leave.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  29 C.F.R. &#167; 825.220(c).  Nor may employers \"use the taking of FMLA leave as a negative factor in employment actions, such as hiring, promotions or disciplinary actions.\"  29 C.F.R. &#167; 825.220(c).  For any such violation, the employer is subject to a claim for compensatory damages and, unless the court finds the violation occurred in good faith, additional liquidated damages.  29 U.S.C. &#167; 2617(a)(1)(A).  These provisions are essentially proscriptive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is this proscriptive group of violations of the Act that is at issue in the present case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Hodgens claims that his termination violated the FMLA because it was prompted by the fact that he took sick leave to which he was entitled under the statute.  In such a case, the employer's motive is relevant, and the issue is whether the employer took the adverse action because of a prohibited reason or for a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason.  Such issues are analogous to those raised in cases involving other types of discrimination, such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e through 2000e-17.  In such cases, courts have created a framework for analyzing the tricky issue of motivation.  See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 800-06, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973) (discrimination under Title VII);  DeNovellis, 124 F.3d at 308 (under ADEA);  Katz v. City Metal Co., 87 F.3d 26, 30 n. 2 (1st Cir.1996) (under ADA).  Some of our sister circuit courts have applied this framework to the proscriptive portion of the FMLA, but not to claims under the prescriptive portion of the Act.  See, e.g., Diaz, 131 F.3d at 712-13;  Morgan v. Hilti, Inc., 108 F.3d 1319, 1323 (10th Cir.1997).  We follow that lead and hold that, when there is no direct evidence of discrimination, the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework applies to claims that an employee was discriminated against for availing himself of FMLA-protected rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McDonnell Douglas allocates the burdens of production and persuasion in accordance with a three-step procedure.  See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802-04, 93 S.Ct. 1817.   Under that framework, a plaintiff employee must carry the initial burden of coming forward with sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of discrimination or retaliation.  McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817;  see Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 252-53, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981).  If he does so, then the burden shifts to the employer \"to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employee's [termination],\" sufficient to raise a genuine issue of fact as to whether it discriminated against the employee.  McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817;  see Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253, 101 S.Ct. 1089.   The employer \"must clearly set forth, through the introduction of admissible evidence, the reasons for the [employee's termination].  The explanation provided must be legally sufficient to justify a judgment for the [employer].\"  Burdine, 450 U.S. at 255, 101 S.Ct. 1089.   If the employer's evidence creates a genuine issue of fact, the presumption of discrimination drops from the case, and the plaintiff retains the ultimate burden of showing that the employer's stated reason for terminating him was in fact a pretext for retaliating against him for having taken protected FMLA leave.  McDonnell Douglas, at 804, 93 S.Ct. 1817;  Burdine, 450 U.S. at 257, 101 S.Ct. 1089;  St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 511, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993).  While a satisfactory evidentiary explanation by the employer for its actions destroys the legally mandatory inference of discrimination arising from the employee's prima facie case, the evidence and inferences that properly can be drawn from the evidence presented during the employee's prima facie case may be considered in determining whether the employer's explanation is pretextual.  Hicks, 509 U.S. at 511, 113 S.Ct. 2742;  see also infra at 168-69 (discussing various ways in which the employee might meet his burden of demonstrating pretext).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To make out a prima facie case of retaliation, Hodgens must show that (1) he availed himself of a protected right under the FMLA;  (2) he was adversely affected by an employment decision;  (3) there is a causal connection between the employee's protected activity and the employer's adverse employment action.  See Randlett v. Shalala, 118 F.3d 857, 862 (1st Cir.1997);  Hilti, Inc., 108 F.3d at 1324.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will follow McDonnell Douglas 's three-step process in analyzing Hodgens's claim--that his termination violated the FMLA because it was prompted by the fact that he took sick leave to which he was entitled under the statute.  The first step in our analysis is to determine whether Hodgens has satisfied all three elements of his prima facie case.  There is no dispute as to the second element:  his termination was an adverse action.  General Dynamics disputes the first and third elements of Hodgens's prima facie case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* General Dynamics asserts that Hodgens has failed to satisfy the first element of his prima facie case.

The district court granted summary judgment to General Dynamics largely on this basis.  For the reasons set forth below, we hold that Hodgens did suffer from a \"serious health condition\" within the meaning of the FMLA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FMLA entitles an employee to twelve workweeks of leave during any twelve-month period \"[b]ecause of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee.\"  29 U.S.C. &#167; 2612(a)(1)(D).  The Act defines a \"serious health condition\" as</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>(A) inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility;  or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>(B) continuing treatment by a health care provider.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 U.S.C. &#167; 2611(11).  Hodgens does not argue that he received any inpatient care for his condition;  thus, &#167; 2611(11)(A) does not apply.

Dr. Wilkinson examined him and, concerned about angina and its serious implications, ordered a series of tests directed toward diagnosing the cause and nature of his problem, with a view toward prescribing treatment (which she eventually did, although she never was able to rule out angina).  Then between September 22 and 27, Hodgens was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, and again was required to make many visits to Dr. Wilkinson's office.  This latter period constituted more than three consecutive days' worth of absences from work for a serious health condition.  And these absences were medically necessary: Hodgens's treating physician, Dr. Wilkinson, filled out a work-restriction form--at the top of which appeared the date September 22--stating September 27 as the date on which Hodgens could return to work.  Dr. Wilkinson's form carries the inference that that entire period of absence was medically necessary, and GD nowhere rebuts that inference.  Indeed, on September 21, GD's own nurse refused to let Hodgens return to work at least in part because of his atrial fibrillation.  Thus, we cannot accept GD's claim, based on Dr. Wilkinson's initially clearing Hodgens to return to work on September 20, that Hodgens's health condition did not prevent him from working within the meaning of the FMLA during the period September 22-27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At least the September 22-27 diagnosis and treatment program met the three day requirement of 29 C.F.R. &#167; 825.114(a)(2) (1993), as long as there was continuing treatment under &#167; 825.114(b).  Hodgens clearly satisfied the requirements of &#167; 825.114(b)(1), at least sufficient to satisfy summary judgment, because he had two or more treatments by a health care provider.  He also fits within &#167; 825.114(b)(2) because he had seen a physician at least once and been placed on a treatment regimen of medication.  See Price v. Marathon Cheese Corp., 119 F.3d 330, 335 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">General Dynamics argues that many of Hodgens's earlier absences were not covered by the FMLA because \"Dr. Wilkinson was never able to diagnose precisely what caused [Hodgens's] symptoms.\"   Def. Br. at 22.  It seems unlikely that Congress intended to punish people who are unlucky enough to develop new diseases, or to suffer serious symptoms for some period of time before the medical profession is able to diagnose the cause of the problem.  Indeed, one reason for taking \"intermittent leave\" under the FMLA would be to visit the doctor for purposes of diagnosis and treatment, even if the employee does not take leave for the periods in between such visits.  It would seem that Congress intended to include visits to a doctor when the employee has symptoms that are eventually diagnosed as constituting a serious health condition, even if, at the time of the initial medical appointments, the illness has not yet been diagnosed nor its degree of seriousness determined.  The Labor Department's final regulations support this interpretation:  \"Treatment for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section [defining 'serious health condition' in terms of 'treatment' received, inter alia] includes (but is not limited to) examinations to determine if a serious health condition exists and evaluations of the condition.\"  29 C.F.R. &#167; 825.114(b) (1997) (emphasis added).  Thus, as long as Hodgens satisfied, at some point in time, the \"more than three consecutive days\" requirement for establishing a serious health condition, his intermittent absences for less than four days (even for portions of one day) were protected under the FMLA if they were necessary \"to determine if a serious health condition exists,\" id., or to treat such a condition.  This is true even if the intermittent absences occurred before the consecutive absences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to &#167; 825.114(a)(2), Hodgens fits within &#167; 825.114(a)(3).  If not treated, Hodgens's illness could have led to a lot more absences from work, or could even have proved fatal, thus bringing him within the ambit of &#167; 825.114(a)(3).  Subsection (a)(3) also requires him to meet the definition of continuing treatment under one of the subsections of &#167; 825.114(b).  As noted supra, he clearly satisfied the requirements of subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2), at least sufficient to survive summary judgment.  With all inferences taken in his favor, the issue is trialworthy, i.e., a trier of fact could find that he met all statutory requirements to show that he did suffer from a \"serious health condition,\" and so his medically necessary leave was protected by the FMLA to the extent it was necessitated by that condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's alternative reason for rejecting Hodgens's FMLA claim is that \"there is no evidence that [his health] condition rendered him unable to perform the functions of his position,\" as required in 29 U.S.C. &#167; 2612(a)(1)(D).  The court therefore concluded that his absences were not protected conduct under the FMLA.  We reject this contention as well.  The court apparently read the statute to require Hodgens to be actually incapacitated, in the sense of medically too sick to work, for any absence that was to be protected by the FMLA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree.  The statutory language--\"unable to perform\" his job--in 29 U.S.C. &#167; 2612(a)(1)(D) does not necessarily mean that an employee's physical condition itself \"actually incapacitate[s]\" him and prevents him from working.  The statute could also be read to protect absences from work for whatever time the employee needs in order to be diagnosed and treated for a serious medical condition.  Under this reading of the statutory language, the employee may be found to be \"unable to perform\" his job if his medical appointments conflict with his work (and the other statutory requirements are met), even if he is not \"too sick to work.\"   The text of the statute does not specify which of these two interpretations of \"unable to perform\" (or any other) was intended by Congress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining which interpretation to adopt, we must consider the fact that the FMLA is a remedial statute.  Cf. Arnold v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 136 F.3d 854, 861 (1st Cir.1998) (interpreting the Americans with Disabilities Act).  \"It is a 'familiar canon of statutory construction that remedial legislation,' \" such as the FMLA, \"should be construed broadly to effectuate its purposes.' \"  Id. (quoting Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U.S. 332, 336, 88 S.Ct. 548, 19 L.Ed.2d 564 (1967)).  The fundamental purpose of the FMLA is \"to entitle employees to take reasonable leave for medical reasons,\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 2601(b)(2), \"to help working men and women balance the conflicting demands of work and personal life,\" City of Fort Wayne, 117 F.3d at 1024.   This purpose is better served by adopting the broader reading than by adopting the district court's more constrained construction requiring physical incapacitation.  We hold that it will suffice if an employee is \"unable to perform\" his job because of the need to obtain medical treatment or a diagnosis;  he does not have to be physically unable to work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative history of the FMLA supports this reading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p>The requirement that the employee be unable to perform his or her job functions does not mean in each instance that the employee must literally be so physically and mentally incapacitated that he or she is generally unable to work....  [I]f the employee must be physically absent from work from time to time in order to receive the treatment, it follows as a matter of common sense that the employee is, during the time of the treatments, temporarily \"unable to perform the functions of his or her position\" for purposes of [&#167; 2612(a)(1)(D) ] and therefore eligible for leave for the time necessary to receive the treatments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">S.

Under the rubric of continuing treatment, the regulation describes \"incapacity\" as \"inability to work ... due to the serious health condition, treatment therefor, or recovery therefrom.\"  29 C.F.R. &#167; 825.114(a)(2)(i) (emphasis added).  In a similar vein, 29 C.F.R. &#167; 825.114(b) (1997) reads as follows:  \"Treatment for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section [defining 'serious health condition' in terms of 'treatment' received, inter alia] includes (but is not limited to) examinations to determine if a serious health condition exists and evaluations of the condition\" (emphasis added).  See also 29 C.F.R. &#167; 825.115 (1997) (\"An employee who must be absent from work to receive medical treatment for a serious health condition is considered to be unable to perform the essential functions of the position during the absence for treatment.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is thus apparent that the agency charged with interpreting the FMLA--and filling in any gaps or ambiguities in the Act--believed that the Act should be interpreted broadly enough to protect absences from work that are necessary for the purpose of having one's medical condition diagnosed and treated, such as those at issue here.  The agency did not interpret the statutory language--that Hodgens's health condition render him \"unable to perform\" his work--as requiring him to be \"too sick to work.\"   The agency's interpretation is entitled to deference.  See Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843-44, 104 S.Ct. 2778.   We hold that Hodgens's absences from work were protected by the FMLA if they were required for the diagnosis and treatment of his medical condition, as long as he satisfied the other requirements for \"seriousness\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>;  it is not necessary that the medical condition make him \"too sick to work\" on a particular day in order for an absence on that day to be covered under the statute.  We therefore reverse the district court's holding to the extent that it stated a contrary view.  The FMLA protected Hodgens's absences whenever his health condition required him to visit his physician rendering him unable to work during the time it took to accomplish those visits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that Hodgens would be entitled to survive summary judgment if a rational trier of fact could find that at least four consecutive days' worth of Hodgens's absences were medically necessary and therefore rendered him \"unable to perform\" his job, within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. &#167; 2612(a)(1)(D), for those days.  Because a rational juror could so find, we hold that at least some of his leave was covered by the FMLA.  Therefore the district court erred to the extent that it predicated its grant of summary judgment on the ground that there was no FMLA-qualifying leave at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus far, we have found that, at the summary judgment stage, Hodgens has satisfied the first element of his prima facie case, by availing himself of a protected right under the FMLA, because at least some of the leave Hodgens took during 1993 and 1994 was FMLA-related.  Nevertheless, GD argues that most of Hodgens's absences were not in fact protected leave under the FMLA, and that it was these non-FMLA absences that motivated it to evaluate Hodgens unfavorably, plus the quality of his performance relative to his peers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument goes to the third element of Hodgens's prima facie case:  whether he has made a sufficient showing of a causal connection between his taking FMLA-protected leave and GD's decision to include him in its RIF and therefore to terminate his employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GD admits that Hodgens's supervisor warned him that he was taking \"too much time off,\" and that this warning came shortly after Hodgens had taken several days off for ear surgery.  GD also concedes that its evaluation of Hodgens one month later advised him to \"make every effort to have [his] absenteeism fall within company guidelines.\"   Additionally, during its April 1994 RIF, GD decided which employees to lay off based on a ranking that considered Hodgens's absentee rate, as well as his performance during prior time periods and that performance was diminished in part due to Hodgens's absences, some of which were FMLA-protected visits to Dr. Wilkinson regarding his heart condition.  This is sufficient to make out a prima facie case that Hodgens's absences were at least one factor in his low performance evaluation and hence in his dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prima facie burden is \"quite easy to meet.\"  Villanueva v.

Therefore, for purposes of this summary judgment motion--where all inferences are drawn in Hodgens's favor--and in light of the relatively low threshold showing necessary to establish a prima facie case, we conclude that Hodgens has satisfied his burden as to the third element (causal connection), as well as the other elements of his prima facie case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having disposed of the challenge to the first step of the McDonnell Douglas analysis (Hodgens's prima facie case), we turn now to the remaining steps:  whether General Dynamics articulated a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Hodgens's employment, and, if so, whether Hodgens has demonstrated, at least to the level of trialworthiness, that the reason was a pretext, and that he was, in reality, discharged discriminatorily on the basis of his having availed himself of a right protected by the Act, namely, the right to take medically necessary leave time.  We conclude that Hodgens failed to demonstrate that a reasonable trier of fact could find his inclusion in the RIF to be based on his having taken FMLA leave.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* Even though Hodgens has established a prima facie case of retaliation, General Dynamics has articulated a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for terminating him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GD stated that Hodgens was transferred out of program planning and eventually to Module 82 for legitimate business reasons, including a realignment of staff that resulted from earlier RIFs, i.e., from RIFs that preceded Hodgens's taking any FMLA-related medical leave.  GD has shown that its April 1994 RIF was legitimate and economically necessary.  And GD has submitted evidence that Hodgens's performance in Module 82 was below par, in any event significantly lower than the performance of all similarly situated Module 82 workers (project managers).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  For present purposes, GD has sufficiently articulated a legitimate reason for its adverse actions against Hodgens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hodgens cannot and does not claim that an employer cannot transfer employees from one department to another or reduce the overall size of its staff if there is a legitimate business reason to do so.  The FMLA certainly does not prevent such transfers or RIFs.  An employer is entitled to reduce and/or reorganize its staff;  efficiency is a legitimate goal.  But an employer may not use its RIF/reorganization/improved-efficiency rationale as a pretext to mask actual discrimination or retaliation;  the mere incantation of the mantra of \"efficiency\" is not a talisman insulating an employer from liability for invidious discrimination.  See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804, 93 S.Ct. 1817 (employer may not use an ostensibly legitimate reason for an adverse action as a pretext for discrimination that is prohibited by statute);  29 U.S.C. &#167; 2615(a);  29 C.F.R. &#167; 825.220;  cf.  INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 944, 103 S.Ct. 2764, 77 L.Ed.2d 317 (1983):  \"Convenience and efficiency are not the primary objectives--or the hallmarks--of democratic government.\"   Nor are they the objectives of public policy underlying statutes like the FMLA or the ADA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* The competing considerations that underlie a pretext analysis are especially problematical in a case like Hodgens's.  Under the McDonnell Douglas framework, in order to rebut the presumption that arises upon the establishment of a prima facie case, the employer need only produce enough competent evidence which, if taken as true, would permit a rational factfinder to conclude that the challenged employment action was taken for a \"legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason,\" Burdine, 450 U.S. at 254-55, 101 S.Ct. 1089;  accord Hicks, 509 U.S. at 509, 113 S.Ct. 2742;  Ruiz v. Posadas de San Juan Assocs., 124 F.3d 243, 248 (1st Cir.1997).  GD has accomplished this here by offering the testimony of its decision-making supervisors that GD discharged Hodgens because of his performance and his non-FMLA absences, and that its decision ignored his FMLA-protected absences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this point, Hodgens must demonstrate that there is a trialworthy issue of pretext.  If we were to permit GD's mere assertion of a legitimate reason to discharge Hodgens to insulate it against liability, then this employer could circumvent the anti-discrimination provisions of the FMLA (and of other statutes) simply by making a unilateral decision to transfer the employee (Hodgens) to a new work station where he has low seniority and/or is unable to perform the new job as well as others who have been in that position for a longer time.  That way, when a RIF occurs (another decision made solely by the employer), Hodgens, as a recent transferee, would be the low person on the totem pole, whether the order of termination proceeds based upon seniority in the position or upon the quality of performance to date.  The decision as to what basis to use in deciding who gets RIFed is, of course, also a decision made unilaterally by the employer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of the availability of seemingly neutral rationales under which an employer can hide its discriminatory intent, and because of the difficulty of accurately determining whether an employer's motive is legitimate or is a pretext for discrimination, there is reason to be concerned about the possibility that an employer could manipulate its decisions to purge employees it wanted to eliminate.  See Weldon v. Kraft, Inc., 896 F.2d 793, 798 (3d Cir.1990) (Subjective evaluations of performance \"are more susceptible of abuse and more likely to mask pretext\" than objective job qualifications.)  (internal quotation marks omitted).  The law does not permit this.  Even if an employer's actions and articulated reasons are facially neutral (e.g., a RIF), if in reality the employer acted for a prohibited reason (e.g., retaliation for exercising a protected right), then its asserted legitimate reason for the RIF and its ostensibly nondiscriminatory selection criteria as to who gets RIFed cannot insulate it from liability.  As Judge Posner wrote in the context of ADA disability discrimination, \"[a] RIF is not an open sesame to discrimination against a disabled person.  Even if the employer has a compelling reason wholly unrelated to the disabilities of any of its employees to reduce the size of its work force, this does not entitle it to use the occasion as a convenient opportunity to get rid of its disabled workers.\"  Matthews v. Commonwealth Edison Co., 128 F.3d 1194, 1195 (7th Cir.1997) (citation omitted).  Nor can it be an opportunity to get rid of workers who exercise their FMLA right to take medical leave for serious medical conditions.  See 29 U.S.C. &#167; 2615(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This means that, where a plaintiff in a discrimination case makes out a prima facie case and the issue becomes whether the employer's stated nondiscriminatory reason is a pretext for discrimination, courts must be \"particularly cautious\" about granting the employer's motion for summary judgment.  Stepanischen v. Merchants Despatch Transp. Corp., 722 F.2d 922, 928 (1st Cir.1983).  Of course, summary judgment is not \" 'automatically preclude[d]' \" even in cases where elusive concepts such as motive or intent are at issue.  See DeNovellis, 124 F.3d at 306 (quoting Valles Velazquez v. Chardon, 736 F.2d 831, 833 (1st Cir.1984)).  \"[I]f the non-moving party rests merely upon conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation,\" summary judgment may be appropriate even where intent is an issue.  Smith v. Stratus Computer, Inc., 40 F.3d 11, 12 (1st Cir.1994) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Where, however, the nonmoving party has produced more than that, trial courts \"should 'use restraint in granting summary judgment' where discriminatory animus is in issue.\"  DeNovellis, 124 F.3d at 306 (quoting Valles Velazquez, 736 F.2d at 833);  see Stepanischen, 722 F.2d at 928.

Sch. of Med., 932 F.2d 19, 27-28 (1st Cir.1991) (en banc), we held that the record did not contain a sufficient showing on the movant's part to permit judgment as a matter of law.  We determined that the movant (university) had to demonstrate that its decision to dismiss the plaintiff (student) \"was a reasoned, professional ... judgment, not a mere ipse dixit.\"  Id. at 27.   As a result, we \"set aside the summary judgment and remand[ed] th[e] issue for further proceedings.\"  Id. at 28;  see Rossy v. Roche Prods., 880 F.2d 621, 626 (1st Cir.1989) (\"All of [the employer's] explanations may in fact be accurate, but they must be decided after trial, especially in cases such as this where [the employer's] intent is the central issue.\").

See Burdine, 450 U.S. at 256, 101 S.Ct. 1089.   Thus, one way an employee may succeed is to show \"such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find them unworthy of credence and [with or without additional evidence and inferences properly drawn therefrom] infer that the employer did not act for the asserted non-discriminatory reasons.\"  Hilti, Inc., 108 F.3d at 1323 (internal quotation marks omitted);  Weldon, 896 F.2d at 798 (courts should be sensitive to myriad of ways such an inference can be created).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, close temporal proximity between two events may give rise to an inference of causal connection.

We have already examined, in a different context, GD's stated reasons for discharging Hodgens.  In Part III(B), supra, we determined that Hodgens had produced sufficient evidence to satisfy the low threshold required to meet the third prong of his prima facie case, i.e., that there was a causal connection between his protected medical leave and his losing his job.  Because GD has met Hodgens's prima facie case by articulating its facially nondiscriminatory reasons for terminating him, we must now examine whether Hodgens has produced sufficient evidence for a rational jury to conclude that those reasons were a pretext for discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the record here, a rational jury could not reach such a conclusion.  It is undisputed that a number of Hodgens's problems on the job took place long before he took his first medical leave.  For example, in 1985, in a previous RIF, GD closed down Hodgens's prior work site in Quincy altogether.  Hodgens was out of work for three years as a result.  After he was re-hired at the Quonset Point facility and doing well for three years, the program planning function in which he was excelling was eliminated in 1991, resulting in his reassignment to production control.  This was still two years before the onset of the medical conditions at issue in the present case, June 1993.  For the year beginning March 1, 1991, Hodgens's performance was ranked eighth out of ten employees in his peer group, and the two employees who ranked behind him were laid off that year as part of another RIF.  In the year beginning March 1, 1992, Hodgens ranked seventh of eleven in his rank group.  Hodgens's poor performance in the two years preceding his illness was a source of great concern to him, particularly as it related to the possibility that he might become the next casualty of GD's efficiency-related RIFs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly before the first relevant manifestation of his heart problems, Hodgens was reassigned to work in Module 82, where his performance problems became even worse.  He worked on Module 82 between April and early August 1993.  Thus, even without parsing the competing evidence as to which portions of Hodgens's poor performance on Module 82 were related or unrelated to the absences caused by his HBP and his potential heart condition, we note that all of the foregoing events--putting Hodgens in an extremely unfavorable position at work--occurred prior to his taking any FMLA-protected medical leave.  This is obvious with respect to the period prior to his being assigned to Module 82;  and it also applies to his poor performance in Module 82 between April and August 1993, which preceded his FMLA-protected leave.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  So none of these events could have been motivated by Hodgens's having taken FMLA-protected leave.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, Hodgens failed to submit any evidence, direct or circumstantial, that General Dynamics's well-justified and documented decision to lay off more workers in April 1994 was a mere pretext for retaliation against Hodgens for exercising his right to take medical leave.  On the contrary, the RIF itself seems real enough and the legitimate business need for it remains unshaken.  There were RIFs before Hodgens became ill, and there is no evidence that there was anything pretextual about GD's general business strategy of reducing its work force in order to maintain its profit levels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, while the RIF as a whole appears legitimate, there remains the question of whether GD's selection of Hodgens in particular to be laid off was based in any way upon his having exercised his FMLA right to take necessary medical leave.  GD presented evidence that Hodgens's ranking for the year beginning March 1, 1993 (including the period of his Module 82 position as well as the period of his FMLA-protected absences, plus less than one month in the machine shop to which he half-heartedly argues he would not have been assigned if he had not taken FMLA leave) was based on a comparison with those senior planners having similar duties, and that he ranked lowest among his peers in terms of performance.  Hodgens himself told his doctor that he was experiencing pressure at work because of a \"decrease in performance because of inexperience in [his] present job.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to overcome the weight of these facts, Hodgens offered the following evidence to dispute the legitimacy of GD's rationale for including him in the layoff, i.e., to show that it was a mere pretext:  (1) shortly after he returned from a significant amount of FMLA-protected medical leave, his supervisor told him he should do something to reduce his \"excessive absences\";  (2) his evaluation contained the statement, \"Make every effort to have your absenteeism fall within the company guidelines\";  (3) his termination was based on the low performance evaluation which he received shortly after returning from his protected medical leave, and this temporal proximity bespeaks a retaliatory intent;  and (4) a memorandum, entitled \"Justification Regarding Drop in Rank Position,\" specifically acknowledged that his absentee rate was a factor in his low performance rating and therefore in his termination.  Thus, in the language of Arlington Heights, Hodgens contends that the \"specific sequence of events\" leading up to his termination, coupled with the contemporary statements by his supervisor (written and oral) warning him about his \"excessive absences,\" constitute proof that GD's decision to terminate him was motivated by his having availed himself of FMLA-protected medical leave.  Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 267-68, 97 S.Ct. 555.   We will discuss these facts seriatim although, in evaluating their sufficiency to withstand summary judgment, we must consider them in combination, not each standing alone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted supra, close temporal proximity between two events may give rise to an inference of causal connection.  Therefore, \"it may be significant that [Hodgens's termination, and the warning that preceded it, occurred] shortly after his having taken FMLA leave.\"  Williams v. Shenango, Inc., 986 F.Supp. 309, 322 (W.D.Pa.1997) (denying summary judgment to employer because a reasonable factfinder could find employer's articulated reasons for suspending and terminating employee to be pretexts for discrimination based on having taken FMLA leave);  see Marx, 76 F.3d at 329 (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Hodgens is correct that temporal proximity may give rise to a \"suggest[ion] of retaliation,\" Oliver, 846 F.2d at 110, that \"suggest[ion]\" is not necessarily conclusive.  We must remember that it is the employee's burden to show pretext, sufficient to survive summary judgment.  This is a question of fact, the resolution of which is usually left to the trier of fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the circumstantial fact of temporal proximity is weakened considerably by the history of GD's prior non-discriminatory RIFs and of Hodgens's poor work performance.  To strengthen his case, Hodgens has produced evidence that his supervisor specifically referred to his \"excessive absences\" and his termination was based on an evaluation and justification memo reflecting the same concern.  According to Hodgens, these contemporaneous statements by the decision-making authority (or its agent) demonstrate persuasively that GD's decision to rank him at the bottom of his peer group and to choose him as the employee from that group to lay off in the 1994 RIF were motivated by retaliatory animus.  The inference is strengthened by the fact that Hodgens had a good work history for three of the five years since he was rehired by GD at Quonset Point and for twenty years previously in Quincy.  On the other hand, the inference is weakened by his performance problems over the two years prior to his taking FMLA-protected medical leave, although it must be remembered that Hodgens survived the earlier RIFs, even if only by the skin of his teeth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Statements by supervisors carrying the inference that the supervisor harbored animus against protected classes of people or conduct are clearly probative of pretext, Kelley v. Airborne Freight Corp., 140 F.3d 335, 347-48 (1st Cir.1998) (Remark that it would be a good time \"to get rid of some of the older mediocre managers\" had a \"direct bearing on age discrimination.\");  EEOC v. G-K-G, Inc., 39 F.3d 740, 746 (7th Cir.1994) (Comment by supervisor that the plaintiff's \"accounts could use some younger blood\" constituted sufficient direct evidence of discriminatory intent.);  Lindahl v. Air France, 930 F.2d 1434, 1439 (9th Cir.1991) (Sexist comments reflecting the supervisor's stereotypical images of men and women raised a genuine issue of fact with respect to pretext.);  Morgan v. Arkansas Gazette, 897 F.2d 945, 951 (8th Cir.1990) (City circulation manager's statements that the plaintiff was \"an old fuddy-duddy\" constituted direct evidence that the defendant's reason for discharging the plaintiff was a pretext for age discrimination.), even if that inference is not the only one that could be drawn from the comment, Binder v. Long Island Lighting Co., 933 F.2d 187, 192-93 (2d Cir.1991) (Statement that plaintiff was overqualified for position raised an issue of material fact with regard to pretext in an age discrimination case.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GD argues that the statements by Hodgens's supervisor are not as damning as Hodgens would have us believe:  they refer only to his \"excessive absences,\" and GD has offered evidence that a great many of Hodgens's absences were not FMLA-protected.  Cf. Hilti, Inc., 108 F.3d at 1322, 1324-25 (finding no genuine issue regarding pretext where employee had a long history of excessive absenteeism over the years, about which she had received several warnings well before she took any FMLA-protected leave).  According to GD, the supervisor was primarily referring to non-protected absences, rendering these statements a great deal less than a \"smoking gun.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hodgens disputes the merits of GD's attempt to parse his absences into FMLA-protected and non-FMLA-protected.  He argues that it was not unreasonable for him to remain absent from work for medical reasons during the entire period that he did, because during this time his physician performed diagnostic tests in an effort to determine how serious his medical condition was and, if indeed it was heart-related, whether it would be safe for him to return to work before it was brought under control.  Dr. Wilkinson was \"most concerned\" that his symptoms and history could indicate that he was suffering from angina, which she was never able to rule out during the entire period of nearly two months that Hodgens was out of work.  If he was suffering from angina, then any stress, including work, would increase the chance that he could have a heart attack.  Similarly, his atrial fibrillation, if not treated properly, could lead to a stroke.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem that Hodgens cannot overcome is that, while Dr. Wilkinson may indeed have been concerned about his condition, she did not tell him that his medical condition required him to stay home from work from August 4 through September 21, 1993.  To the contrary, while she thought it was \"reasonable\" for Hodgens to want to stay home from work pending the outcome of his tests, she in fact recommended that he return to work despite his medical condition and its potential risks.  As GD notes, Hodgens could, for example, have kept any given medical appointment in the morning, and then come back to work for the remainder of the day, which he did do on some occasions but not on others.  Thus, apart from the period from September 22-27, while Hodgens's medical condition clearly did require him to be absent from work during the times necessary for his medical visits, it did not require the vast majority of his absences during August and September.  The remainder of his absences between August 4 and September 21 as well as after September 27 were therefore not protected by the FMLA, i.e., the time that was not actually necessary for him to attend medical appointments related to his heart condition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  GD was not precluded from taking those unprotected absences into account in evaluating Hodgens's performance and in determining whether to include Hodgens in the RIF.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question of summary judgment here is a close one because both GD and Hodgens have presented probative evidence tending to support their respective versions of the facts, on the question whether GD's reason for discharging Hodgens was legitimate or merely a pretext to retaliate against him for taking FMLA-protected medical leave.  The weighing of such alternative factual scenarios would ordinarily be left to the finder of fact after trial.  But on this record, the weight of the evidence does not \"present[ ] a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury\";  it is \"so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.\"  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 251-52, 106 S.Ct. 2505.   No rational factfinder could reasonably conclude that GD terminated Hodgens in retaliation for exercising his rights under the statute:  the vast majority of Hodgens's absences were not FMLA-protected;  overwhelming evidence demonstrated his poor performance, during two full years prior to his protected medical leave plus during the portion of the 1993-94 evaluation year that preceded his medical leave;  and the evidence Hodgens offered was simply insufficient to outweigh the foregoing, such that a factfinder could infer pretext.  Because \"a fair-minded jury could [not] return a verdict for [Hodgens] on the evidence presented,\" Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505, we affirm the grant of summary judgment on the FMLA claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hodgens also makes a claim under the ADA.  We affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment on the ADA claim on the same basis that we affirm on the FMLA claim.  Hodgens never demonstrated, to the level of sufficiency required on a motion for summary judgment, that GD's stated reason for terminating him--a RIF based on his performance--was a pretext for his asserted disability.  Hodgens has certainly not made any more persuasive a demonstration that his layoff was a pretext for discrimination based on his disability than he did to show that it was a pretext for retaliation based on his having taken FMLA leave.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, his ADA claim must fail, and the grant of summary judgment to General Dynamics must be affirmed, albeit on a different basis than that relied upon by the district court.  We will affirm a correct result reached by the court below \"on any independently sufficient ground made manifest by the record.\"  Palmacci v. Umpierrez, 121 F.3d 781, 792 (1st Cir.1997);  AIDS Action Comm. of Mass. v. MBTA, 42 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.1994) (internal quotation marks omitted).  We need not decide whether the district court was correct in holding that certain of Hodgens's medical conditions (HBP and atrial fibrillation) did not constitute a disability within the meaning of the ADA, and in particular, whether deciding that issue should proceed with or without consideration of Hodgens's ameliorative medications.  See Arnold, 136 F.3d 854.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The grant of summary judgment to General Dynamics is Affirmed.

These state laws require essentially the same elements as the corresponding federal laws.  Therefore, our disposition of the federal claims likewise disposes of the parallel state law claims.  Hodgens also made claims under the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\"ADEA\"), 29 U.S.C. &#167; 621 et seq., and under the Rhode Island Civil Rights Act, of 1990, R.I. Gen.

The Department of Labor regulations implementing the FMLA interpret the Act this way, see 29 C.F.R. &#167; 825.220(c) (\"An employer is prohibited from discriminating against employees ... who have used FMLA leave.\"), and those regulations are entitled to deference, see Chevron USA Inc. v.

Because Hodgens's health-related leave and subsequent termination from employment occurred in 1993 and 1994, however, the final regulations do not apply here, and the Secretary's interim regulations govern this dispute.

His complaint further alleged that his discharge constituted discrimination based on his disability (high blood pressure and atrial fibrillation), in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12101-12213 (1994).  The district court granted GD's motion for summary judgment.  The court found that Hodgens's leave was not protected under the FMLA because he did not have a \"serious health condition,\" as required by the Act. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 2612(a)(1)(D).  And the court rejected his ADA claim on the ground that his medical condition, after taking account of mitigating treatment, did not constitute a disability within the meaning of the ADA. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12102(2)(A).

From 1964 until 1985, Hodgens worked for General Dynamics at its Quincy, Massachusetts location.  The facility was closed and Hodgens was laid off in 1985.  In approximately February 1988, General Dynamics hired Hodgens as a Senior Planner at its Quonset Point (R.I.) facility.  He worked in the program planning area until September 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">His performance was evaluated quite highly during his years in program planning.  GD's evaluation system (as applied to his positions with the company) consisted of an annual ranking, covering the period beginning March 1 of one year through the end of February of the next.  Similarly situated employees (in the same or similar job titles, pay grades, etc.) were placed in \"peer\" or \"rank\" groups and then numerically \"ranked\" based on performance.  The employees in a particular rank group were evaluated by all supervisors of such employees, at a meeting where performance was discussed and rankings determined by consensus.  During the three years in which Hodgens worked in program planning, he was ranked first (among four or five) in his peer group.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1991, the program planning function at Quonset Point was eliminated and Hodgens was reassigned to the production control area, where he worked until his termination in July 1994.  Unlike program planning--where Hodgens had tracked costs and performed a data auditing function, not requiring a deep knowledge of construction procedures--production control was \"hands on\" work, requiring familiarity with the details of submarine hull and components manufacturing.  Because Hodgens had not previously done this type of work, he was at a disadvantage relative to his co-workers who did have such experience.  As a result, Hodgens's performance fell.  In 1992, he was ranked eighth of ten;  the employees who ranked ninth and tenth were laid off that year as part of a reduction in force (\"RIF\").  In 1993, Hodgens ranked seventh of eleven in his rank group.  Hodgens was concerned about his performance in production control, and especially worried about the possibility that his low performance might lead to his being laid off if there were to be another RIF.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For his first two years in production control, Hodgens performed sound dampening functions (a process by which submarines are soundproofed).  He performed this part of his duties in a satisfactory manner;  his last evaluation covering the period 1993-94 stated that he did an \"excellent job in sound dampening.\"   At some point during this period, however, GD decided to change its employees' responsibilities from specializing in a particular function to include all aspects of a project.  Hodgens was assigned to \"Module 82,\" an area on the Seawolf submarine.  His duties included monitoring and facilitating the work on the module, filling work orders, maintaining proper material flow, and solving production problems.  He worked on Module 82 between April and the beginning of August 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was during this period that Hodgens began to experience medical problems, including chest pains, visual problems, and profuse perspiration.  These began in approximately June or July 1993.  On August 4, he began to see his doctor, Dr. Joanne Wilkinson.  She was \"most concerned\" that his symptoms, coupled with his history of hypertension (high blood pressure or HBP), might indicate that he was suffering from angina, which could be extremely serious or even fatal.  She therefore advised Hodgens to undergo a stress test and an electrocardiogram (EKG).  Dr. Wilkinson continued to see Hodgens on frequent occasions throughout August, during which time she was unable either to make a diagnosis or to rule out angina.  During some of these visits, Hodgens's blood pressure was \"way up,\" and Dr. Wilkinson continued to treat Hodgens as if he had angina.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the period of these visits, from August 4 until September 27, Hodgens did not return to work.  According to him, this was because of his need for numerous visits to Dr. Wilkinson and other physicians for evaluation and treatment, and because he wanted to be sure he did not do anything that might aggravate any potential heart condition.  Dr. Wilkinson testified at her deposition that she thought it was \"reasonable\" for Hodgens to stay home from work until he got the results of his stress test, although, if her patient had wanted to return to work during the interim, she would have been \"comfortable\" with that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Wilkinson also treated Hodgens for hypertension, prescribing a combination of medications, and for acute anxiety reactions.  As part of the treatment for the latter, Dr. Wilkinson referred Hodgens to a psychologist for counseling to help reduce his stress.  According to Hodgens's testimony, he had never previously experienced the degree of stress that he experienced in Module 82.  Dr. Wilkinson also referred Hodgens to Dr. Jacobs, an ophthalmologist, because of his visual problems.  Dr. Jacobs determined that he was suffering from migraine auras.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 13, 1993, Dr. Wilkinson told Hodgens that the results of his EKG, MRI and stress test were normal.  She was able to rule out a stroke or a serious neurological problem, but she was still unable to rule out the possibility of angina.  Nevertheless, she cleared Hodgens to return to work as of September 20.  He did not return on that day, however, because he felt ill in his car and had to return home.  He did return to work on September 21.  As a matter of General Dynamics policy, GD's company nurse had to examine any employee, such as Hodgens, who had been out of work for more than five days because of illness.  During her examination, the nurse detected that Hodgens was experiencing atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) and that his blood pressure was elevated.  She therefore refused to allow him to return to work and suggested that he see his doctor immediately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hodgens did so, and Dr. Wilkinson diagnosed him as suffering from atrial fibrillation, a serious and potentially life-threatening heart condition.  After treating him, by prescribing medication to thin his blood in order to prevent a stroke, Dr. Wilkinson told Hodgens he could return to work on September 27.  She restricted him to working half-days during the first week, and to working a light-duty schedule for the following three weeks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hodgens returned to work on September 27.  General Dynamics changed his assignment so that he was no longer part of a module;  according to GD, Module 82 was nearing completion.  Instead, until December 1993, Hodgens was assigned exclusively to performing sound dampening tasks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter, Hodgens had to take additional intermittent medical leave to deal with an ear problem.  His hearing problem manifested itself on September 29, 1993, and he saw a physician six times in three months.  On January 7, 1994, he had ear surgery on an outpatient basis.  The surgery left him dizzy and fatigued;  in order to recuperate, he required medication and bed rest for several days.  He returned to work on January 11.  In February, he was assigned to the machine shop (GD says this was in March).  Here, his duties were, according to Hodgens, \"low-level, demeaning, and not the type normally performed by Senior Planners.\"   He was no longer performing sound dampening duties.  Instead, another employee was assigned to those duties, an employee who Hodgens claims was less experienced and less qualified to perform them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1994, Hodgens asked his new supervisor for vacation leave to handle a family emergency.  His supervisor responded that he was taking \"too much time off,\" and issued a verbal warning about his attendance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 10, Hodgens met with his former supervisor, and received his annual evaluation covering the period March 1993 through February 1994.  The evaluation contained the statement:  \"Make every effort to have your absenteeism fall within the company guidelines.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same May 10 meeting, the supervisor told him he was being laid off for lack of work, effective July 8, 1994.  His performance had been ranked seventh among seven members of his rank group for the year ending February 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hodgens brought suit in district court, alleging that his termination violated the FMLA because it was an adverse action taken on the basis of his having availed himself of protected leave.  He also alleged that it violated the ADA because it was based on his disabilities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  General Dynamics filed a motion for summary judgment, contending that Hodgens failed to establish a prima facie case under the FMLA because he did not suffer from a \"serious health condition.\"   GD also argued that Hodgens is not protected by the ADA because his conditions did not constitute a \"disability.\"   The district court granted GD's motion.  According to the court, \"an employee's absence [from work] must be necessary to enable the employee to receive treatment.  If an employee can obtain treatment without missing work, any period of absence cannot be attributed to the need to receive treatment.\"   As for the ADA, the court held that, taking into account the ameliorative effects of Hodgens's medications, his medical conditions did not constitute a disability under the ADA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* We review grants of summary judgment de novo.

Among the findings prompting the Act was Congress's belief that \"there is inadequate job security for employees who have serious health conditions that prevent them from working for temporary periods.\"  29 U.S.C. &#167; 2601(a)(4).  The FMLA seeks to accomplish its purposes \"in a manner that accommodates the legitimate interests of employers.\"  29 U.S.C. &#167; 2601(b)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FMLA contains two distinct types of provisions.  First, it creates a series of substantive rights.  Eligible employees \"shall be entitled\" to up to twelve weeks of unpaid leave per year for any one of the following purposes:  when the employee has \"a serious health condition that makes [him or her] unable to perform the functions of [his or her] position,\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 2612(a)(1)(D);  to care for a close family member with such a condition, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 2612(a)(1)(C);  or because of the birth, adoption, or placement in foster care of a child, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 2612(a)(1)(A) &amp; (B).  See also 29 U.S.C. &#167; 2611(11);  29 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 825.100(a), 825.114 (1997) (defining a \"serious health condition\").  Following a qualified absence, the employee is entitled to return to the same position or an alternate position with equivalent pay, benefits, and working conditions, and without loss of accrued seniority.  29 U.S.C. &#167; 2614(a)(1);  29 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 825.100(c) (1997).  The FMLA also provides for \"intermittent\" leave, which allows an employee to take such leave intermittently \"when medically necessary,\" such as to attend appointments with a health care provider for necessary treatment of a serious health condition.  29 U.S.C. &#167; 2612(b);  29 C.F.R. &#167; 825.117 (1997) (defining requirements for intermittent leave).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These rights are essentially prescriptive, \"set[ting] substantive floors\" for conduct by employers, and creating \"entitlements\" for employees.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Diaz v.

As to these rights, therefore, the employee need not show that the employer treated other employees less favorably, and an employer may not defend its interference with the FMLA's substantive rights on the ground that it treats all employees equally poorly without discriminating.

The issue is simply whether the employer provided its employee the entitlements set forth in the FMLA--for example, a twelve-week leave or reinstatement after taking a medical leave.

Dr. Wilkinson examined him and, concerned about angina and its serious implications, ordered a series of tests directed toward diagnosing the cause and nature of his problem, with a view toward prescribing treatment (which she eventually did, although she never was able to rule out angina).  Then between September 22 and 27, Hodgens was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, and again was required to make many visits to Dr. Wilkinson's office.  This latter period constituted more than three consecutive days' worth of absences from work for a serious health condition.  And these absences were medically necessary: Hodgens's treating physician, Dr. Wilkinson, filled out a work-restriction form--at the top of which appeared the date September 22--stating September 27 as the date on which Hodgens could return to work.  Dr. Wilkinson's form carries the inference that that entire period of absence was medically necessary, and GD nowhere rebuts that inference.  Indeed, on September 21, GD's own nurse refused to let Hodgens return to work at least in part because of his atrial fibrillation.  Thus, we cannot accept GD's claim, based on Dr. Wilkinson's initially clearing Hodgens to return to work on September 20, that Hodgens's health condition did not prevent him from working within the meaning of the FMLA during the period September 22-27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At least the September 22-27 diagnosis and treatment program met the three day requirement of 29 C.F.R. &#167; 825.114(a)(2) (1993), as long as there was continuing treatment under &#167; 825.114(b).  Hodgens clearly satisfied the requirements of &#167; 825.114(b)(1), at least sufficient to satisfy summary judgment, because he had two or more treatments by a health care provider.  He also fits within &#167; 825.114(b)(2) because he had seen a physician at least once and been placed on a treatment regimen of medication.  See Price v.

Br. at 22.  It seems unlikely that Congress intended to punish people who are unlucky enough to develop new diseases, or to suffer serious symptoms for some period of time before the medical profession is able to diagnose the cause of the problem.  Indeed, one reason for taking \"intermittent leave\" under the FMLA would be to visit the doctor for purposes of diagnosis and treatment, even if the employee does not take leave for the periods in between such visits.  It would seem that Congress intended to include visits to a doctor when the employee has symptoms that are eventually diagnosed as constituting a serious health condition, even if, at the time of the initial medical appointments, the illness has not yet been diagnosed nor its degree of seriousness determined.  The Labor Department's final regulations support this interpretation:  \"Treatment for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section [defining 'serious health condition' in terms of 'treatment' received, inter alia] includes (but is not limited to) examinations to determine if a serious health condition exists and evaluations of the condition.\"  29 C.F.R. &#167; 825.114(b) (1997) (emphasis added).  Thus, as long as Hodgens satisfied, at some point in time, the \"more than three consecutive days\" requirement for establishing a serious health condition, his intermittent absences for less than four days (even for portions of one day) were protected under the FMLA if they were necessary \"to determine if a serious health condition exists,\" id., or to treat such a condition.  This is true even if the intermittent absences occurred before the consecutive absences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to &#167; 825.114(a)(2), Hodgens fits within &#167; 825.114(a)(3).  If not treated, Hodgens's illness could have led to a lot more absences from work, or could even have proved fatal, thus bringing him within the ambit of &#167; 825.114(a)(3).  Subsection (a)(3) also requires him to meet the definition of continuing treatment under one of the subsections of &#167; 825.114(b).  As noted supra, he clearly satisfied the requirements of subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2), at least sufficient to survive summary judgment.  With all inferences taken in his favor, the issue is trialworthy, i.e., a trier of fact could find that he met all statutory requirements to show that he did suffer from a \"serious health condition,\" and so his medically necessary leave was protected by the FMLA to the extent it was necessitated by that condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's alternative reason for rejecting Hodgens's FMLA claim is that \"there is no evidence that [his health] condition rendered him unable to perform the functions of his position,\" as required in 29 U.S.C. &#167; 2612(a)(1)(D).  The court therefore concluded that his absences were not protected conduct under the FMLA.  We reject this contention as well.  The court apparently read the statute to require Hodgens to be actually incapacitated, in the sense of medically too sick to work, for any absence that was to be protected by the FMLA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree.  The statutory language--\"unable to perform\" his job--in 29 U.S.C. &#167; 2612(a)(1)(D) does not necessarily mean that an employee's physical condition itself \"actually incapacitate[s]\" him and prevents him from working.  The statute could also be read to protect absences from work for whatever time the employee needs in order to be diagnosed and treated for a serious medical condition.  Under this reading of the statutory language, the employee may be found to be \"unable to perform\" his job if his medical appointments conflict with his work (and the other statutory requirements are met), even if he is not \"too sick to work.\"   The text of the statute does not specify which of these two interpretations of \"unable to perform\" (or any other) was intended by Congress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining which interpretation to adopt, we must consider the fact that the FMLA is a remedial statute.

This purpose is better served by adopting the broader reading than by adopting the district court's more constrained construction requiring physical incapacitation.

Under the rubric of continuing treatment, the regulation describes \"incapacity\" as \"inability to work ... due to the serious health condition, treatment therefor, or recovery therefrom.\"  29 C.F.R. &#167; 825.114(a)(2)(i) (emphasis added).  In a similar vein, 29 C.F.R. &#167; 825.114(b) (1997) reads as follows:  \"Treatment for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section [defining 'serious health condition' in terms of 'treatment' received, inter alia] includes (but is not limited to) examinations to determine if a serious health condition exists and evaluations of the condition\" (emphasis added).  See also 29 C.F.R. &#167; 825.115 (1997) (\"An employee who must be absent from work to receive medical treatment for a serious health condition is considered to be unable to perform the essential functions of the position during the absence for treatment.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is thus apparent that the agency charged with interpreting the FMLA--and filling in any gaps or ambiguities in the Act--believed that the Act should be interpreted broadly enough to protect absences from work that are necessary for the purpose of having one's medical condition diagnosed and treated, such as those at issue here.  The agency did not interpret the statutory language--that Hodgens's health condition render him \"unable to perform\" his work--as requiring him to be \"too sick to work.\"   The agency's interpretation is entitled to deference.  See Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843-44, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We hold that Hodgens's absences from work were protected by the FMLA if they were required for the diagnosis and treatment of his medical condition, as long as he satisfied the other requirements for \"seriousness\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>;  it is not necessary that the medical condition make him \"too sick to work\" on a particular day in order for an absence on that day to be covered under the statute.  We therefore reverse the district court's holding to the extent that it stated a contrary view.  The FMLA protected Hodgens's absences whenever his health condition required him to visit his physician rendering him unable to work during the time it took to accomplish those visits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that Hodgens would be entitled to survive summary judgment if a rational trier of fact could find that at least four consecutive days' worth of Hodgens's absences were medically necessary and therefore rendered him \"unable to perform\" his job, within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. &#167; 2612(a)(1)(D), for those days.  Because a rational juror could so find, we hold that at least some of his leave was covered by the FMLA.  Therefore the district court erred to the extent that it predicated its grant of summary judgment on the ground that there was no FMLA-qualifying leave at issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus far, we have found that, at the summary judgment stage, Hodgens has satisfied the first element of his prima facie case, by availing himself of a protected right under the FMLA, because at least some of the leave Hodgens took during 1993 and 1994 was FMLA-related.  Nevertheless, GD argues that most of Hodgens's absences were not in fact protected leave under the FMLA, and that it was these non-FMLA absences that motivated it to evaluate Hodgens unfavorably, plus the quality of his performance relative to his peers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument goes to the third element of Hodgens's prima facie case:  whether he has made a sufficient showing of a causal connection between his taking FMLA-protected leave and GD's decision to include him in its RIF and therefore to terminate his employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GD admits that Hodgens's supervisor warned him that he was taking \"too much time off,\" and that this warning came shortly after Hodgens had taken several days off for ear surgery.  GD also concedes that its evaluation of Hodgens one month later advised him to \"make every effort to have [his] absenteeism fall within company guidelines.\"   Additionally, during its April 1994 RIF, GD decided which employees to lay off based on a ranking that considered Hodgens's absentee rate, as well as his performance during prior time periods and that performance was diminished in part due to Hodgens's absences, some of which were FMLA-protected visits to Dr. Wilkinson regarding his heart condition.  This is sufficient to make out a prima facie case that Hodgens's absences were at least one factor in his low performance evaluation and hence in his dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prima facie burden is \"quite easy to meet.\"  Villanueva v.

Therefore, for purposes of this summary judgment motion--where all inferences are drawn in Hodgens's favor--and in light of the relatively low threshold showing necessary to establish a prima facie case, we conclude that Hodgens has satisfied his burden as to the third element (causal connection), as well as the other elements of his prima facie case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having disposed of the challenge to the first step of the McDonnell Douglas analysis (Hodgens's prima facie case), we turn now to the remaining steps:  whether General Dynamics articulated a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Hodgens's employment, and, if so, whether Hodgens has demonstrated, at least to the level of trialworthiness, that the reason was a pretext, and that he was, in reality, discharged discriminatorily on the basis of his having availed himself of a right protected by the Act, namely, the right to take medically necessary leave time.  We conclude that Hodgens failed to demonstrate that a reasonable trier of fact could find his inclusion in the RIF to be based on his having taken FMLA leave.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* Even though Hodgens has established a prima facie case of retaliation, General Dynamics has articulated a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for terminating him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">GD stated that Hodgens was transferred out of program planning and eventually to Module 82 for legitimate business reasons, including a realignment of staff that resulted from earlier RIFs, i.e., from RIFs that preceded Hodgens's taking any FMLA-related medical leave.  GD has shown that its April 1994 RIF was legitimate and economically necessary.  And GD has submitted evidence that Hodgens's performance in Module 82 was below par, in any event significantly lower than the performance of all similarly situated Module 82 workers (project managers).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  For present purposes, GD has sufficiently articulated a legitimate reason for its adverse actions against Hodgens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hodgens cannot and does not claim that an employer cannot transfer employees from one department to another or reduce the overall size of its staff if there is a legitimate business reason to do so.  The FMLA certainly does not prevent such transfers or RIFs.  An employer is entitled to reduce and/or reorganize its staff;  efficiency is a legitimate goal.  But an employer may not use its RIF/reorganization/improved-efficiency rationale as a pretext to mask actual discrimination or retaliation;  the mere incantation of the mantra of \"efficiency\" is not a talisman insulating an employer from liability for invidious discrimination.

GD has accomplished this here by offering the testimony of its decision-making supervisors that GD discharged Hodgens because of his performance and his non-FMLA absences, and that its decision ignored his FMLA-protected absences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this point, Hodgens must demonstrate that there is a trialworthy issue of pretext.  If we were to permit GD's mere assertion of a legitimate reason to discharge Hodgens to insulate it against liability, then this employer could circumvent the anti-discrimination provisions of the FMLA (and of other statutes) simply by making a unilateral decision to transfer the employee (Hodgens) to a new work station where he has low seniority and/or is unable to perform the new job as well as others who have been in that position for a longer time.  That way, when a RIF occurs (another decision made solely by the employer), Hodgens, as a recent transferee, would be the low person on the totem pole, whether the order of termination proceeds based upon seniority in the position or upon the quality of performance to date.  The decision as to what basis to use in deciding who gets RIFed is, of course, also a decision made unilaterally by the employer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of the availability of seemingly neutral rationales under which an employer can hide its discriminatory intent, and because of the difficulty of accurately determining whether an employer's motive is legitimate or is a pretext for discrimination, there is reason to be concerned about the possibility that an employer could manipulate its decisions to purge employees it wanted to eliminate.  See Weldon v. Kraft, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536996\"><a href=\"/opinion/536996/52-fair-emplpraccas-355-29-wage-hour-cas-bn-1158-52-empl-prac/\"><span class=\"volume\">896</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">793</span></a></span>, 798 (3d Cir.1990) (Subjective evaluations of performance \"are more susceptible of abuse and more likely to mask pretext\" than objective job qualifications.)  (internal quotation marks omitted).  The law does not permit this.  Even if an employer's actions and articulated reasons are facially neutral (e.g., a RIF), if in reality the employer acted for a prohibited reason (e.g., retaliation for exercising a protected right), then its asserted legitimate reason for the RIF and its ostensibly nondiscriminatory selection criteria as to who gets RIFed cannot insulate it from liability.  As Judge Posner wrote in the context of ADA disability discrimination, \"[a] RIF is not an open sesame to discrimination against a disabled person.  Even if the employer has a compelling reason wholly unrelated to the disabilities of any of its employees to reduce the size of its work force, this does not entitle it to use the occasion as a convenient opportunity to get rid of its disabled workers.\"  Matthews v.

We have already examined, in a different context, GD's stated reasons for discharging Hodgens.  In Part III(B), supra, we determined that Hodgens had produced sufficient evidence to satisfy the low threshold required to meet the third prong of his prima facie case, i.e., that there was a causal connection between his protected medical leave and his losing his job.  Because GD has met Hodgens's prima facie case by articulating its facially nondiscriminatory reasons for terminating him, we must now examine whether Hodgens has produced sufficient evidence for a rational jury to conclude that those reasons were a pretext for discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the record here, a rational jury could not reach such a conclusion.  It is undisputed that a number of Hodgens's problems on the job took place long before he took his first medical leave.  For example, in 1985, in a previous RIF, GD closed down Hodgens's prior work site in Quincy altogether.  Hodgens was out of work for three years as a result.  After he was re-hired at the Quonset Point facility and doing well for three years, the program planning function in which he was excelling was eliminated in 1991, resulting in his reassignment to production control.  This was still two years before the onset of the medical conditions at issue in the present case, June 1993.  For the year beginning March 1, 1991, Hodgens's performance was ranked eighth out of ten employees in his peer group, and the two employees who ranked behind him were laid off that year as part of another RIF.  In the year beginning March 1, 1992, Hodgens ranked seventh of eleven in his rank group.  Hodgens's poor performance in the two years preceding his illness was a source of great concern to him, particularly as it related to the possibility that he might become the next casualty of GD's efficiency-related RIFs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly before the first relevant manifestation of his heart problems, Hodgens was reassigned to work in Module 82, where his performance problems became even worse.  He worked on Module 82 between April and early August 1993.  Thus, even without parsing the competing evidence as to which portions of Hodgens's poor performance on Module 82 were related or unrelated to the absences caused by his HBP and his potential heart condition, we note that all of the foregoing events--putting Hodgens in an extremely unfavorable position at work--occurred prior to his taking any FMLA-protected medical leave.  This is obvious with respect to the period prior to his being assigned to Module 82;  and it also applies to his poor performance in Module 82 between April and August 1993, which preceded his FMLA-protected leave.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  So none of these events could have been motivated by Hodgens's having taken FMLA-protected leave.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, Hodgens failed to submit any evidence, direct or circumstantial, that General Dynamics's well-justified and documented decision to lay off more workers in April 1994 was a mere pretext for retaliation against Hodgens for exercising his right to take medical leave.  On the contrary, the RIF itself seems real enough and the legitimate business need for it remains unshaken.  There were RIFs before Hodgens became ill, and there is no evidence that there was anything pretextual about GD's general business strategy of reducing its work force in order to maintain its profit levels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, while the RIF as a whole appears legitimate, there remains the question of whether GD's selection of Hodgens in particular to be laid off was based in any way upon his having exercised his FMLA right to take necessary medical leave.  GD presented evidence that Hodgens's ranking for the year beginning March 1, 1993 (including the period of his Module 82 position as well as the period of his FMLA-protected absences, plus less than one month in the machine shop to which he half-heartedly argues he would not have been assigned if he had not taken FMLA leave) was based on a comparison with those senior planners having similar duties, and that he ranked lowest among his peers in terms of performance.  Hodgens himself told his doctor that he was experiencing pressure at work because of a \"decrease in performance because of inexperience in [his] present job.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to overcome the weight of these facts, Hodgens offered the following evidence to dispute the legitimacy of GD's rationale for including him in the layoff, i.e., to show that it was a mere pretext:  (1) shortly after he returned from a significant amount of FMLA-protected medical leave, his supervisor told him he should do something to reduce his \"excessive absences\";  (2) his evaluation contained the statement, \"Make every effort to have your absenteeism fall within the company guidelines\";  (3) his termination was based on the low performance evaluation which he received shortly after returning from his protected medical leave, and this temporal proximity bespeaks a retaliatory intent;  and (4) a memorandum, entitled \"Justification Regarding Drop in Rank Position,\" specifically acknowledged that his absentee rate was a factor in his low performance rating and therefore in his termination.  Thus, in the language of Arlington Heights, Hodgens contends that the \"specific sequence of events\" leading up to his termination, coupled with the contemporary statements by his supervisor (written and oral) warning him about his \"excessive absences,\" constitute proof that GD's decision to terminate him was motivated by his having availed himself of FMLA-protected medical leave.  Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 267-68, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109573\"><a href=\"/opinion/109573/arlington-heights-v-metropolitan-housing-development-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Therefore, \"it may be significant that [Hodgens's termination, and the warning that preceded it, occurred] shortly after his having taken FMLA leave.\"  Williams v.

We must remember that it is the employee's burden to show pretext, sufficient to survive summary judgment.

To strengthen his case, Hodgens has produced evidence that his supervisor specifically referred to his \"excessive absences\" and his termination was based on an evaluation and justification memo reflecting the same concern.  According to Hodgens, these contemporaneous statements by the decision-making authority (or its agent) demonstrate persuasively that GD's decision to rank him at the bottom of his peer group and to choose him as the employee from that group to lay off in the 1994 RIF were motivated by retaliatory animus.  The inference is strengthened by the fact that Hodgens had a good work history for three of the five years since he was rehired by GD at Quonset Point and for twenty years previously in Quincy.  On the other hand, the inference is weakened by his performance problems over the two years prior to his taking FMLA-protected medical leave, although it must be remembered that Hodgens survived the earlier RIFs, even if only by the skin of his teeth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Statements by supervisors carrying the inference that the supervisor harbored animus against protected classes of people or conduct are clearly probative of pretext, Kelley v.

Cf. Hilti, Inc., 108 F.3d at 1322, 1324-25 (finding no genuine issue regarding pretext where employee had a long history of excessive absenteeism over the years, about which she had received several warnings well before she took any FMLA-protected leave).  According to GD, the supervisor was primarily referring to non-protected absences, rendering these statements a great deal less than a \"smoking gun.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hodgens disputes the merits of GD's attempt to parse his absences into FMLA-protected and non-FMLA-protected.  He argues that it was not unreasonable for him to remain absent from work for medical reasons during the entire period that he did, because during this time his physician performed diagnostic tests in an effort to determine how serious his medical condition was and, if indeed it was heart-related, whether it would be safe for him to return to work before it was brought under control.  Dr. Wilkinson was \"most concerned\" that his symptoms and history could indicate that he was suffering from angina, which she was never able to rule out during the entire period of nearly two months that Hodgens was out of work.  If he was suffering from angina, then any stress, including work, would increase the chance that he could have a heart attack.  Similarly, his atrial fibrillation, if not treated properly, could lead to a stroke.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem that Hodgens cannot overcome is that, while Dr. Wilkinson may indeed have been concerned about his condition, she did not tell him that his medical condition required him to stay home from work from August 4 through September 21, 1993.  To the contrary, while she thought it was \"reasonable\" for Hodgens to want to stay home from work pending the outcome of his tests, she in fact recommended that he return to work despite his medical condition and its potential risks.  As GD notes, Hodgens could, for example, have kept any given medical appointment in the morning, and then come back to work for the remainder of the day, which he did do on some occasions but not on others.  Thus, apart from the period from September 22-27, while Hodgens's medical condition clearly did require him to be absent from work during the times necessary for his medical visits, it did not require the vast majority of his absences during August and September.  The remainder of his absences between August 4 and September 21 as well as after September 27 were therefore not protected by the FMLA, i.e., the time that was not actually necessary for him to attend medical appointments related to his heart condition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  GD was not precluded from taking those unprotected absences into account in evaluating Hodgens's performance and in determining whether to include Hodgens in the RIF.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question of summary judgment here is a close one because both GD and Hodgens have presented probative evidence tending to support their respective versions of the facts, on the question whether GD's reason for discharging Hodgens was legitimate or merely a pretext to retaliate against him for taking FMLA-protected medical leave.  The weighing of such alternative factual scenarios would ordinarily be left to the finder of fact after trial.  But on this record, the weight of the evidence does not \"present[ ] a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury\";  it is \"so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.\"  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 251-52, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111719\"><a href=\"/opinion/111719/anderson-v-liberty-lobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

No rational factfinder could reasonably conclude that GD terminated Hodgens in retaliation for exercising his rights under the statute:  the vast majority of Hodgens's absences were not FMLA-protected;  overwhelming evidence demonstrated his poor performance, during two full years prior to his protected medical leave plus during the portion of the 1993-94 evaluation year that preceded his medical leave;  and the evidence Hodgens offered was simply insufficient to outweigh the foregoing, such that a factfinder could infer pretext.  Because \"a fair-minded jury could [not] return a verdict for [Hodgens] on the evidence presented,\" Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111719\"><a href=\"/opinion/111719/anderson-v-liberty-lobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment on the ADA claim on the same basis that we affirm on the FMLA claim.  Hodgens never demonstrated, to the level of sufficiency required on a motion for summary judgment, that GD's stated reason for terminating him--a RIF based on his performance--was a pretext for his asserted disability.  Hodgens has certainly not made any more persuasive a demonstration that his layoff was a pretext for discrimination based on his disability than he did to show that it was a pretext for retaliation based on his having taken FMLA leave.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, his ADA claim must fail, and the grant of summary judgment to General Dynamics must be affirmed, albeit on a different basis than that relied upon by the district court.

Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span>, 843-44, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 825.220(b) (1997) (Interfering with the exercise of FMLA rights \"would include, for example, not only refusing to authorize FMLA leave, but discouraging an employee from using such leave.\")</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> For example, Hodgens has not alleged that GD denied him any necessary medical leave, or that it refused to reinstate him after he returned from such leave.  Nor does General Dynamics dispute that Hodgens is an eligible employee and that General Dynamics is a covered employer under the provisions of the FMLA.  See 29 U.S.C. &#167; 2611(2) &amp; (4)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Pursuant to his statutory authority, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 2654, the Secretary of Labor promulgated final regulations implementing the FMLA, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 825.100 et seq.  (1997), which became effective on April 6, 1995, 60 Fed.Reg. 2180, 2181 (Jan. 6, 1995).  Because Hodgens's health-related leave and subsequent termination from employment occurred in 1993 and 1994, however, the final regulations do not apply here, and the Secretary's interim regulations govern this dispute.  See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 825.100 et seq.  (1993)</p>\n        <p>We note that the district court in this case appears to have applied the final regulations, which are similar to, but not identical with, the applicable interim regulations.  But this error need not detain us.  The Third Circuit in Victorelli v. Shadyside Hosp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"747611\"><a href=\"/opinion/747611/kathleen-m-victorelli-v-shadyside-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">184</span></a></span> (3d Cir.1997), compared the interim and the final rules, as pertinent here, and concluded that \"the standard for 'continuing treatment' has remained unchanged.\"  128 F.3d at 189.   We agree.  The final regulation \" 'retains the concept that continuing treatment includes either two visits to a health care provider or one visit followed by continuing treatment by [or] under the supervision of a health care provider.' \"  Id. (quoting 60 Fed.Reg. 2180, 2195 (Jan. 6, 1995)).  We will analyze the interim rules which are applicable here, but because the analogous final rules are essentially the same, we hope our analysis will eliminate the need for further litigation raising the same issues regarding the corresponding final rules.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Subsection 114(a)(1), dealing with inpatient care, is not applicable here</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The major difference between the interim and the final regulations is that the latter explicitly require more than three consecutive days of medically required absence from work.  See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 825.114(a)(2)(i) (1997).  It is arguable that we should read the word \"consecutive\" into the interim regulations as well.  We will analyze the present case as if more than three consecutive days' absence were required;  we need not decide the question definitively because, as discussed infra, Hodgens satisfies the time requirement regardless of whether the absences must be consecutive</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Although the final regulations are not at issue here because they were not yet effective, we may be guided by them insofar as they shed light on our interpretation of the interim regulations.
