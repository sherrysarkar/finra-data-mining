Richard G.

Nuby, Sr. on brief pro se.\r\n James E. Harvey, Jr., John F.

Appellant Theodore Nuby appeals from the\r\ndistrict court's judgment dismissing his action pursuant to 28\r\nU.S.C.  1915(e).  Appellee South Boston Savings Bank, however,\r\nargues that appellant's May 13, 1997 notice of appeal was filed\r\ntoo late to bring up for review the judgment of dismissal which\r\nwas entered on the docket on January 6, 1997.  See Fed. R. App.\r\nP. 4(a)(1) (where the United States or an agency or officer\r\nthereof is not a party, a litigant has 30 days within which to\r\nfile a notice of appeal).  We disagree and reach the merits of\r\nthe dismissal.  See Fiore v. Washington County Community Mental\r\nHealth Ctr., 960 F.2d 229 (1st Cir. 1992)(en banc).\r\n          This action lacked an arguable legal basis and so we\r\naffirm.  Simply, the Right to Financial Privacy Act does not\r\napply to appellant's situation because it pertains only to\r\nfederal agencies.  See 12 U.S.C.  3401(3) (defining the kind\r\nof \"government authority\" subject to the Act's requirements as\r\nlimited to \"any agency or department of the United States, or\r\nany officer, employee, or agent thereof\") (emphasis added). \r\nThus, requests for bank records by state agencies are not\r\ncovered by the Act.  See In re Grand Jury Applications, 536\r\nN.Y.S.2d 939, 943 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1988) (the Act does not\r\nrestrict access to bank records by state authorities); Nicholsv. Council on Judicial Complaints, 615 P.2d 280, 283 (Okla.\r\n1980) (only federal agencies are restricted by the requirements\r\nof the Act).  As a result, appellant has no cause of action\r\nagainst the South Boston Savings Bank (or, for that matter, the\r\nMassachusetts Department of Welfare) under the Act.\r\n          The district court's judgment of dismissal is\r\naffirmed. \r\n",
