Defendant-appellant\n\nDavid Forsyth Johnstone appeals from his conviction and sentence\n\nfor   unlawful         reentry     into    the     United    States      following\n\ndeportation.          Johnstone    was    deported    after    his    state-court\n\nconviction for forgery in Colorado, which the district court\n\ndeemed    an       aggravated    felony   for    purposes    of   enhancing    his\n\nfederal sentence.           He now contends that he received inadequate\n\nassistance of counsel in the Colorado proceedings and that the\n\nforgery should not be considered an aggravated felony.                          We\n\naffirm.\n\n                                  I.   BACKGROUND\n\n               In 1998, Johnstone, a British subject, stole a credit\n\ncard and used it to pay for a Colorado rafting trip for himself\n\nand two friends.            Johnstone was charged in state court with\n\nforgery,       a    Class    5   felony    under    Colorado      law;   criminal\n\nimpersonation, a Class 6 felony; and unauthorized use of a\n\nfinancial transaction device.               He pled guilty to the forgery\n\ncharge in exchange for the state’s dismissal of the unauthorized\n\nuse charge.         Johnstone received a sentence of one year in prison\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fon the forgery charge.1 Following his guilty plea, Johnstone was\n\ndeported.\n\n                He later reentered the United States without having\n\napplied to do so.           On March 13, 2000, a detective with the\n\nWaterville, Maine Police Department contacted the United States\n\nImmigration        and    Naturalization   Service   and   reported   that\n\nJohnstone was suspected of fraud in Waterville.                 Johnstone\n\nfalsely claimed in loan applications to a Waterville bank and a\n\ncredit union that he received a monthly pension from the United\n\nStates Marine Corps.         He also used false Social Security numbers\n\nwhen       he    opened   accounts   at    three   Waterville   financial\n\ninstitutions.\n\n                Johnstone was charged in a single-count indictment and\n\na two-count information with reentering the United States after\n\nhaving been deported, 8 U.S.C. § 1326(b)(2); providing false\n\nstatements in loan applications to a credit union and a bank,\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1014; and with use of false Social Security numbers,\n\n42 U.S.C. § 408(a)(7)(B).\n\n                On June 20, 2000, Johnstone first appeared before the\n\ndistrict court for entry of pleas of guilty to the indictment\n\n\n       1\n     The forgery sentence apparently ran consecutively with a\none-year sentence imposed on the criminal impersonation charge,\nresulting in a sentence totaling two years. Only the forgery\nsentence is relevant to this appeal, since it is the basis for\nthe aggravated felony sentence enhancement.\n\n                                     -4-\n\fand the information.        The court explained to Johnstone the\n\nrights he would give up upon his waiver of indictment and pleas\n\nof guilty.     The court accepted the waiver of indictment, and\n\nJohnstone entered his guilty pleas.      When he stated that he was\n\nunaware that the penalties for the three offenses could be\n\nimposed consecutively, the court suspended the proceedings.\n\n         On July 10, 2000, the plea hearing resumed.       Again, the\n\ncourt explained to Johnstone the rights he would waive.            This\n\ntime, Johnstone stated that he understood that he was exposed to\n\nmaximum terms of imprisonment of twenty years on the immigration\n\ncharge and    thirty years on the false statements charge, which\n\ncould be imposed consecutively.\n\n         On October 25, 2000, the court conducted a presentence\n\nconference.     Johnstone   contended   that   his   Colorado   counsel\n\nfailed to advise him of his right to consular notification and\n\nof the effect that the guilty plea would have on his alien\n\nstatus, hence providing ineffective assistance.        He stated that\n\nhe had obtained new counsel in Colorado to attack his state-\n\ncourt conviction, and moved to withdraw his plea for the limited\n\npurpose of obtaining post-conviction review.\n\n         The district court stated that Johnstone was convicted\n\nof an aggravated felony at the time of his deportation.              It\n\nconcluded that it was irrelevant whether the Colorado conviction\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fwas later vacated.         Additionally, the court determined that\n\nJohnstone’s Colorado counsel’s alleged failures did not amount\n\nto ineffective assistance of counsel.           Thus, nothing prevented\n\nthe court from relying on the Colorado conviction to support the\n\nenhancement    of   Johnstone’s     federal     sentence   for   illegally\n\nreentering the country.          Accordingly, the court denied his\n\nmotion for a partial withdrawal of his guilty plea.              It offered\n\nhim the opportunity to file a motion to completely withdraw his\n\nplea,          which        Johnstone             did       not       do.\n\n          The court also found that the Supreme Court’s decision\n\nin Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), did not help\n\nJohnstone.     It held that Apprendi did not apply to this case\n\nbecause the application of the sentencing enhancement under\n\nsection   1326(b)(2)   did    not   increase     his   maximum   statutory\n\npenalty beyond that contemplated by his plea agreement and\n\nguilty plea.\n\n          On    November    7,   2000,    the   district   court    held   a\n\nsentencing hearing.    Under U.S.S.G. § 2L1.2(a), the base offense\n\nlevel for illegally reentering the United States was eight.\n\nSixteen levels were added pursuant to section 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)\n\nbecause Johnstone had been deported after conviction for an\n\naggravated felony, i.e. the Colorado forgery conviction.            Credit\n\nfor acceptance of responsibility reduced the total offense level\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fto twenty-one.            The court calculated eight criminal history\n\npoints, which resulted in a guideline sentencing range of fifty-\n\nseven to seventy-one months.2\n\n           The court considered each of Johnstone’s asserted bases\n\nfor a downward departure from the guideline sentencing range.3\n\nThe   court       found    no    justification   for   departing   from   the\n\nguideline range, noting that “nothing . . . takes this case out\n\nof the heartland.”\n\n           The government recommended a downward departure under\n\nU.S.S.G.      §    5K1.1,       for   Johnstone’s   cooperation    with   the\n\nprosecution, and recommended a sentence of fifty-one months in\n\nprison.    The court allowed the government’s motion and imposed\n\na sentence of forty-five months' imprisonment on the reentry\n\ncharge.    Concurrent sentences of nine months were imposed for\n\nthe false statement charge and for the charge of using false\n\n\n\n\n      2\n     The false statement offenses were grouped under U.S.S.G.\n§ 3D1.2(b) with a total offense level of seven.     The offense\nlevel of seven and the previously calculated Criminal History\nCategory of IV yielded a guideline sentencing range of eight to\nfourteen months.\n\n      3\n     Specifically, Johnstone asserted that the facilities in\nfederal prison were inadequate to treat his medical condition;\nthat the aggravated felony enhancement for the Colorado forgery\noverstated the seriousness of his criminal history; and that he\nhad reentered the country to assist in the support of his wife,\na college student in Maine.\n\n                                        -7-\n\fSocial   Security    numbers.       The   court   further   ordered    that\n\nJohnstone pay $2,006 in restitution to Key Bank.\n\n                             II.   DISCUSSION\n\n            Johnstone first argues that the district court erred\n\nas a matter of law in increasing his sentence on the ground that\n\nthe Colorado conviction constituted an aggravated felony.                  We\n\nreview this contention de novo.       United States v. Luna-Diaz, 222\n\nF.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n            For the crime of reentering the United States following\n\ndeportation, 8 U.S.C. § 1326(b)(2), 4 the sentencing guidelines\n\nincrease the base offense level from eight to twenty-four if the\n\ndefendant    was   removed   or    deported   after   conviction      of   an\n\n\n\n    4Section 1326 reads, in pertinent part, as follows:\n\n    . . . any alien who–-\n\n    (1) has been denied admission, excluded, deported, or\n    removed or has departed the United States while an\n    order of exclusion, deportation, or removal is\n    out-standing, and thereafter\n\n    (2) enters, attempts to enter, or is at any time found\n    in, the United States, unless . . . the Attorney\n    General has expressly consented to such alien’s\n    reapplying for admission . . . shall be fined under\n    Title 18, or imprisoned not more than 2 years, or\n    both.\n\nSubsection(b)(2) increases the maximum statutory penalty from\ntwo to twenty years for any alien described in subsection (a)\n“whose removal was subsequent to a conviction for commission of\nan aggravated felony . . . .”\n\n                                    -8-\n\f“aggravated felony.”            U.S.S.G. § 2L1.2(b)(1)(A).                     The commentary\n\nto this section defines \"aggravated felony\" by reference to 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1101(a)(43), id., cmt. n.1, which includes “an offense\n\nrelating   to   .     .    .    forgery     .     .    .     for      which       the    term    of\n\nimprisonment     is       at   least     one    year       .     .    .   .”       8    U.S.C.    §\n\n1101(a)(43)(R).5\n\n           Johnstone was deported following a 1998 conviction for\n\nforgery, which Colorado law categorizes as a Class 5 felony and\n\nwhich carries a maximum prison term of three years.                                Johnstone’s\n\nactual sentence was one year.                  There is simply no question that\n\nthe Colorado conviction was an aggravated felony within the\n\nplain   language      of       section    1101(a)(43)(R).                    Therefore,         the\n\ndistrict court did not err when it increased Johnstone’s base\n\noffense level to twenty-four under U.S.S.G. § 2L1.2(b)(1)(A).\n\n           Second,         Johnstone      renews           his       contention         that    his\n\ncounsel did not advise him of the Vienna Convention or the\n\npossibility     of    deportation,          and       that       therefore        he    received\n\nineffective     assistance          of   counsel.              He     has    challenged         his\n\nColorado   conviction          on   these       grounds.             At     the   very    least,\n\nJohnstone urges, this court should vacate his sentence until\n\n\n\n    5Johnstone also contends that the facts on which his\nconviction was based amount only to petty larceny at most, not\nforgery.     For the reasons explained infra, we cannot\ncollaterally review the Colorado court's conviction.\n\n                                           -9-\n\fpost-conviction   review    is   complete.     We   review   the   legal\n\ndetermination of the guidelines' meaning and scope de novo.\n\nLuna-Diaz, 222 F.3d at 3.\n\n          Our holding in Luna-Diaz, id. at 4, forecloses this\n\ncollateral attack on the state court conviction.          There, we held\n\nthat the plain language of 8 U.S.C. § 1326(b) and U.S.S.G.\n\n§   2L1.2(b)   required    the   imposition    of   the   sixteen-level\n\nenhancement based on even a vacated conviction of an aggravated\n\nfelony.   As long as the removal occurred after the conviction,\n\na conviction that is later vacated can serve as an “aggravated\n\nfelony” under 8 U.S.C. § 1326(b)(2).         \"By all indications, the\n\nrelevant time under the statute is the moment of removal, not of\n\nsentencing.\"    Id.\n\n          Accordingly, the future status of Johnstone's forgery\n\nconviction is irrelevant to the guideline enhancement.          Even if\n\nJohnstone received ineffective assistance of counsel in Colorado\n\nand his forgery conviction is vacated, his federal sentence is\n\nunaffected.    We conclude that the district court did not err in\n\ndenying Johnstone’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea and\n\ncontinue sentencing pending resolution of his post-conviction\n\nchallenge to his Colorado forgery conviction.\n\n          Third, Johnstone argues that the district court erred\n\nin not submitting the sentencing enhancement to a jury.               He\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fcontends    that     under     Apprendi,        he   is    entitled      to   a    jury\n\ndetermination of whether he was deported following an aggravated\n\nfelony conviction.           See Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 490 (jury must\n\ndetermine beyond a reasonable doubt facts that \"increase the\n\nprescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is\n\nexposed\").\n\n            No     Apprendi     violation       occurs,      however,      when     the\n\ndistrict    court     sentences      a    defendant        below   the     statutory\n\nmaximum,    even    if   a    fact   determined       by     the   court      under   a\n\npreponderance standard lengthens the sentence imposed.                            United\n\nStates v. Robinson, 241 F.3d 115, 119 (1st Cir. 2001) (court's\n\nfindings under preponderance standard concerning drug amount,\n\nwhich increased appellant's sentence, did not violate Apprendi\n\nbecause    sentence      imposed     was    less      than    default      statutory\n\nmaximum).        Here, the applicable statute set forth a maximum\n\nsentence of twenty years for the unlawful reentry charge.                              8\n\nU.S.C. § 1326(b)(2).         The plea agreement and hearings make clear\n\nthat Johnstone fully understood that he faced that maximum\n\npenalty.     The actual sentence imposed by the district court,\n\neven with the enhancement, was forty-five months, well under\n\n\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\fthat maximum.      Accordingly, the district court correctly held\n\nthat Apprendi does not apply.       See Robinson, 241 F.3d at 118-19.6\n\n         Finally, Johnstone contends that the district court\n\nerred in declining to award a downward departure on the grounds\n\nof his medical condition, the purported overstatement of the\n\nseriousness   of   his   criminal    history,   and/or   his    motive   in\n\nreturning to the United States.            The court of appeals has no\n\njurisdiction, however, to review a district court’s decision not\n\nto depart downward unless the district court misunderstood its\n\nauthority to do so.      United States v. Orlando-Figueroa, 229 F.3d\n\n33, 49 (1st Cir. 2000).       The record does not reflect any such\n\nmisunderstanding on the part of the district court.            Rather, the\n\ncourt stated that each ground was “properly within [the court’s]\n\nauthority to consider as a basis for downward departure,” and\n\nthat whether to depart would be “a matter of [the court’s] own\n\njudgment and discretion.”       Accordingly, we may not review the\n\n\n\n\n    6 Moreover, by its express terms, Apprendi concerns only\nsentencing facts \"[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction.\n. .” 530 U.S. at 490. Here, Johnstone’s maximum sentence for\nhis offense increased to twenty years solely because of his\ndeportation following his prior conviction in Colorado.\nTherefore, although we need not decide this issue today, we\ndoubt that Apprendi applies to Johnstone’s case for the\nadditional reason that the increase in his maximum sentence was\ndue to a prior conviction. See United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda,\n234 F.3d 411, 415 (9th Cir. 2000).\n\n                                    -12-\n\fdistrict court’s rejection of Johnstone's requests for downward\n\ndepartures.7\n\n         The conviction and sentence are affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n    7 In addition, Johnstone makes two more cursory arguments,\nneither of which have merit. First, he contends that the felony\nconviction is an element of a section 1326 offense, and thus\nshould have been separately set forth in the indictment and\nsubmitted to the jury.    The Supreme Court has held, however,\nthat section 1326(b)(2) is merely a sentencing factor, not a\nseparate criminal offense. Almendarez-Torres v. United States,\n523 U.S. 224, 235 (1998).    Second, Johnstone argues that the\nsentencing enhancement violates the Eighth Amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution; because he apparently did not make\nthis argument below, we review only for plain error. Under that\nstandard, we conclude that Johnstone has not shown the kind of\n\"gross disproportionality\" between the gravity of the criminal\nconduct and the severity of his sentence that an Eighth\nAmendment challenge requires.    United States v. Cardoza, 129\nF.3d 6, 18 (1st Cir. 1997).    Other courts have rejected such\nchallenges of much longer sentences under section 1326(b). See,\ne.g., United States v. Cardenas-Alvarez, 987 F.2d 1129, 1134\n(5th Cir. 1993) (100-month sentence); United States v. Cupa-\nGuillen, 34 F.3d 860, 865 (9th Cir. 1994) (100-month sentence).\n\n                             -13-\n\f",

He pled guilty to the forgery charge in exchange for the state's dismissal of the unauthorized use charge. Johnstone received a sentence of one year in prison on the forgery charge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Following his guilty plea, Johnstone was deported.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He later reentered the United States without having applied to do so. On March 13, 2000, a detective with the Waterville, Maine Police Department contacted the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service and reported that Johnstone was suspected of fraud in Waterville. Johnstone falsely claimed in loan applications to a Waterville bank and a credit union that he received a monthly pension from the United States Marine Corps.

The court explained to Johnstone the rights he would give up upon his waiver of indictment and pleas of guilty. The court accepted the waiver of indictment, and Johnstone entered his guilty pleas. When he stated that he was unaware that the penalties for the three offenses could be imposed consecutively, the court suspended the proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 10, 2000, the plea hearing resumed.

Johnstone contended that his Colorado counsel failed to advise him of his right to consular notification and of the effect that the guilty plea would have on his alien status, hence providing ineffective assistance. He stated that he had obtained new counsel in Colorado to attack his state-court conviction, and moved to withdraw his plea for the limited purpose of obtaining post-conviction review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court stated that Johnstone was convicted of an aggravated felony at the time of his deportation. It concluded that it was irrelevant whether the Colorado conviction was later vacated. Additionally, the court determined that Johnstone's Colorado counsel's alleged failures did not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel. Thus, nothing prevented the court from relying on the Colorado conviction to support the enhancement of Johnstone's federal sentence for illegally reentering the country. Accordingly, the court denied his motion for a partial withdrawal of his guilty plea. It offered him the opportunity to file a motion to completely withdraw his plea, which Johnstone did not do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also found that the Supreme Court's decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), did not help Johnstone. It held that Apprendi did not apply to this case because the application of the sentencing enhancement under section 1326(b)(2) did not increase his maximum statutory penalty beyond that contemplated by his plea agreement and guilty plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 7, 2000, the district court held a sentencing hearing. Under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2(a), the base offense level for illegally reentering the United States was eight. Sixteen levels were added pursuant to section 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) because Johnstone had been deported after conviction for an aggravated felony, i.e. the Colorado forgery conviction. Credit for acceptance of responsibility reduced the total offense level to twenty-one. The court calculated eight criminal history points, which resulted in a guideline sentencing range of fifty-seven to seventy-one months.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court considered each of Johnstone's asserted bases for a downward departure from the guideline sentencing range.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The court found no justification for departing from the guideline range, noting that \"nothing . . . takes this case out of the heartland.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government recommended a downward departure under U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K1.1, for Johnstone's cooperation with the prosecution, and recommended a sentence of fifty-one months in prison.

Concurrent sentences of nine months were imposed for the false statement charge and for the charge of using false Social Security numbers.

DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Johnstone first argues that the district court erred as a matter of law in increasing his sentence on the ground that the Colorado conviction constituted an aggravated felony. We review this contention de novo. United States v. Luna-Diaz, 222 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the crime of reentering the United States following deportation, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(b)(2),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> the sentencing guidelines increase the base offense level from eight to twenty-four if the defendant was removed or deported after conviction of an \"aggravated felony.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2(b)(1)(A). The commentary to this section defines \"aggravated felony\" by reference to 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(43), id., cmt. n.1, which includes \"an offense relating to . . . forgery . . . for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year . . . .\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(43)(R).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Johnstone was deported following a 1998 conviction for forgery, which Colorado law categorizes as a Class 5 felony and which carries a maximum prison term of three years. Johnstone's actual sentence was one year. There is simply no question that the Colorado conviction was an aggravated felony within the plain language of section 1101(a)(43)(R). Therefore, the district court did not err when it increased Johnstone's base offense level to twenty-four under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2(b)(1)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Johnstone renews his contention that his counsel did not advise him of the Vienna Convention or the possibility of deportation, and that therefore he received ineffective assistance of counsel. He has challenged his Colorado conviction on these grounds. At the very least, Johnstone urges, this court should vacate his sentence until post-conviction review is complete. We review the legal determination of the guidelines' meaning and scope de novo. Luna-Diaz, 222 F.3d at 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our holding in Luna-Diaz, id. at 4, forecloses this collateral attack on the state court conviction. There, we held that the plain language of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(b) and U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2(b) required the imposition of the sixteen-level enhancement based on even a vacated conviction of an aggravated felony. As long as the removal occurred after the conviction, a conviction that is later vacated can serve as an \"aggravated felony\" under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(b)(2). \"By all indications, the relevant time under the statute is the moment of removal, not of sentencing.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the future status of Johnstone's forgery conviction is irrelevant to the guideline enhancement. Even if Johnstone received ineffective assistance of counsel in Colorado and his forgery conviction is vacated, his federal sentence is unaffected. We conclude that the district court did not err in denying Johnstone's motion to withdraw his guilty plea and continue sentencing pending resolution of his post-conviction challenge to his Colorado forgery conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, Johnstone argues that the district court erred in not submitting the sentencing enhancement to a jury. He contends that under Apprendi, he is entitled to a jury determination of whether he was deported following an aggravated felony conviction. See Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 490 (jury must determine beyond a reasonable doubt facts that \"increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No Apprendi violation occurs, however, when the district court sentences a defendant below the statutory maximum, even if a fact determined by the court under a preponderance standard lengthens the sentence imposed. United States v. Robinson, 241 F.3d 115, 119 (1st Cir. 2001) (court's findings under preponderance standard concerning drug amount, which increased appellant's sentence, did not violate Apprendi because sentence imposed was less than default statutory maximum). Here, the applicable statute set forth a maximum sentence of twenty years for the unlawful reentry charge. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(b)(2). The plea agreement and hearings make clear that Johnstone fully understood that he faced that maximum penalty. The actual sentence imposed by the district court, even with the enhancement, was forty-five months, well under that maximum. Accordingly, the district court correctly held that Apprendi does not apply. See Robinson, 241 F.3d at 118-19.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Johnstone contends that the district court erred in declining to award a downward departure on the grounds of his medical condition, the purported overstatement of the seriousness of his criminal history, and/or his motive in returning to the United States. The court of appeals has no jurisdiction, however, to review a district court's decision not to depart downward unless the district court misunderstood its authority to do so. United States v. Orlando-Figueroa, 229 F.3d 33, 49 (1st Cir. 2000). The record does not reflect any such misunderstanding on the part of the district court. Rather, the court stated that each ground was \"properly within [the court's] authority to consider as a basis for downward departure,\" and that whether to depart would be \"a matter of [the court's] own judgment and discretion.\" Accordingly, we may not review the district court's rejection of Johnstone's requests for downward departures.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conviction and sentence are affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The forgery sentence apparently ran consecutively with a one-year sentence imposed on the criminal impersonation charge, resulting in a sentence totaling two years. Only the forgery sentence is relevant to this appeal, since it is the basis for the aggravated felony sentence enhancement.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The false statement offenses were grouped under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.2(b) with a total offense level of seven. The offense level of seven and the previously calculated Criminal History Category of IV yielded a guideline sentencing range of eight to fourteen months.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Specifically, Johnstone asserted that the facilities in federal prison were inadequate to treat his medical condition; that the aggravated felony enhancement for the Colorado forgery overstated the seriousness of his criminal history; and that he had reentered the country to assist in the support of his wife, a college student in Maine.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Section 1326 reads, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n        <p>. . . any alien who--</p>\n        <p>(1) has been denied admission, excluded, deported, or removed or has departed the United States while an order of exclusion, deportation, or removal is out-standing, and thereafter</p>\n        <p>(2) enters, attempts to enter, or is at any time found in, the United States, unless . . . the Attorney General has expressly consented to such alien's reapplying for admission . . . shall be fined under Title 18, or imprisoned not more than 2 years, or both.</p>\n        <p>Subsection(b)(2) increases the maximum statutory penalty from two to twenty years for any alien described in subsection (a) \"whose removal was subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony . . . .\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Johnstone also contends that the facts on which his conviction was based amount only to petty larceny at most, not forgery. For the reasons explained infra, we cannot collaterally review the Colorado court's conviction.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Moreover, by its express terms, Apprendi concerns only sentencing facts \"[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction. . .\" 530 U.S. at 490. Here, Johnstone's maximum sentence for his offense increased to twenty years solely because of his deportation following his prior conviction in Colorado. Therefore, although we need not decide this issue today, we doubt that Apprendi applies to Johnstone's case for the additional reason that the increase in his maximum sentence was due to a prior conviction. See United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, 234 F.3d 411, 415 (9th Cir. 2000).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> In addition, Johnstone makes two more cursory arguments, neither of which have merit. First, he contends that the felony conviction is an element of a section 1326 offense, and thus should have been separately set forth in the indictment and submitted to the jury. The Supreme Court has held, however, that section 1326(b)(2) is merely a sentencing factor, not a separate criminal offense. Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224, 235 (1998). Second, Johnstone argues that the sentencing enhancement violates the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution; because he apparently did not make this argument below, we review only for plain error. Under that standard, we conclude that Johnstone has not shown the kind of \"gross disproportionality\" between the gravity of the criminal conduct and the severity of his sentence that an Eighth Amendment challenge requires. United States v. Cardoza, 129 F.3d 6, 18 (1st Cir. 1997). Other courts have rejected such challenges of much longer sentences under section 1326(b). See, e.g., United States v. Cardenas-Alvarez, 987 F.2d 1129, 1134 (5th Cir. 1993) (100-month sentence); United States v. Cupa-Guillen, 34 F.3d 860, 865 (9th Cir. 1994) (100-month sentence).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Luna-Diaz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199022\"><a href=\"/opinion/199022/united-states-v-luna-diaz/\"><span class=\"volume\">222</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the crime of reentering the United States following deportation, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(b)(2),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> the sentencing guidelines increase the base offense level from eight to twenty-four if the defendant was removed or deported after conviction of an \"aggravated felony.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2(b)(1)(A). The commentary to this section defines \"aggravated felony\" by reference to 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(43), id., cmt. n.1, which includes \"an offense relating to . . . forgery . . . for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year . . . .\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(43)(R).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Johnstone was deported following a 1998 conviction for forgery, which Colorado law categorizes as a Class 5 felony and which carries a maximum prison term of three years. Johnstone's actual sentence was one year. There is simply no question that the Colorado conviction was an aggravated felony within the plain language of section 1101(a)(43)(R). Therefore, the district court did not err when it increased Johnstone's base offense level to twenty-four under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2(b)(1)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Johnstone renews his contention that his counsel did not advise him of the Vienna Convention or the possibility of deportation, and that therefore he received ineffective assistance of counsel. He has challenged his Colorado conviction on these grounds. At the very least, Johnstone urges, this court should vacate his sentence until post-conviction review is complete. We review the legal determination of the guidelines' meaning and scope de novo. Luna-Diaz, 222 F.3d at 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our holding in Luna-Diaz, id. at 4, forecloses this collateral attack on the state court conviction. There, we held that the plain language of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(b) and U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2(b) required the imposition of the sixteen-level enhancement based on even a vacated conviction of an aggravated felony. As long as the removal occurred after the conviction, a conviction that is later vacated can serve as an \"aggravated felony\" under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(b)(2). \"By all indications, the relevant time under the statute is the moment of removal, not of sentencing.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the future status of Johnstone's forgery conviction is irrelevant to the guideline enhancement. Even if Johnstone received ineffective assistance of counsel in Colorado and his forgery conviction is vacated, his federal sentence is unaffected. We conclude that the district court did not err in denying Johnstone's motion to withdraw his guilty plea and continue sentencing pending resolution of his post-conviction challenge to his Colorado forgery conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, Johnstone argues that the district court erred in not submitting the sentencing enhancement to a jury. He contends that under Apprendi, he is entitled to a jury determination of whether he was deported following an aggravated felony conviction. See Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 490 (jury must determine beyond a reasonable doubt facts that \"increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No Apprendi violation occurs, however, when the district court sentences a defendant below the statutory maximum, even if a fact determined by the court under a preponderance standard lengthens the sentence imposed. United States v. Robinson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199304\"><a href=\"/opinion/199304/united-states-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span>, 119 (1st Cir. 2001) (court's findings under preponderance standard concerning drug amount, which increased appellant's sentence, did not violate Apprendi because sentence imposed was less than default statutory maximum). Here, the applicable statute set forth a maximum sentence of twenty years for the unlawful reentry charge. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(b)(2). The plea agreement and hearings make clear that Johnstone fully understood that he faced that maximum penalty. The actual sentence imposed by the district court, even with the enhancement, was forty-five months, well under that maximum. Accordingly, the district court correctly held that Apprendi does not apply. See Robinson, 241 F.3d at 118-19.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Johnstone contends that the district court erred in declining to award a downward departure on the grounds of his medical condition, the purported overstatement of the seriousness of his criminal history, and/or his motive in returning to the United States. The court of appeals has no jurisdiction, however, to review a district court's decision not to depart downward unless the district court misunderstood its authority to do so. United States v. Orlando-Figueroa, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199119\"><a href=\"/opinion/199119/united-states-v-orlando-figueroa/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 49 (1st Cir. 2000). The record does not reflect any such misunderstanding on the part of the district court. Rather, the court stated that each ground was \"properly within [the court's] authority to consider as a basis for downward departure,\" and that whether to depart would be \"a matter of [the court's] own judgment and discretion.\" Accordingly, we may not review the district court's rejection of Johnstone's requests for downward departures.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conviction and sentence are affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The forgery sentence apparently ran consecutively with a one-year sentence imposed on the criminal impersonation charge, resulting in a sentence totaling two years. Only the forgery sentence is relevant to this appeal, since it is the basis for the aggravated felony sentence enhancement.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The false statement offenses were grouped under U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.2(b) with a total offense level of seven. The offense level of seven and the previously calculated Criminal History Category of IV yielded a guideline sentencing range of eight to fourteen months.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Specifically, Johnstone asserted that the facilities in federal prison were inadequate to treat his medical condition; that the aggravated felony enhancement for the Colorado forgery overstated the seriousness of his criminal history; and that he had reentered the country to assist in the support of his wife, a college student in Maine.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Section 1326 reads, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n        <p>. . . any alien who--</p>\n        <p>(1) has been denied admission, excluded, deported, or removed or has departed the United States while an order of exclusion, deportation, or removal is out-standing, and thereafter</p>\n        <p>(2) enters, attempts to enter, or is at any time found in, the United States, unless . . . the Attorney General has expressly consented to such alien's reapplying for admission . . . shall be fined under Title 18, or imprisoned not more than 2 years, or both.</p>\n        <p>Subsection(b)(2) increases the maximum statutory penalty from two to twenty years for any alien described in subsection (a) \"whose removal was subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony . . . .\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Johnstone also contends that the facts on which his conviction was based amount only to petty larceny at most, not forgery. For the reasons explained infra, we cannot collaterally review the Colorado court's conviction.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Moreover, by its express terms, Apprendi concerns only sentencing facts \"[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction. . .\" 530 U.S. at 490. Here, Johnstone's maximum sentence for his offense increased to twenty years solely because of his deportation following his prior conviction in Colorado. Therefore, although we need not decide this issue today, we doubt that Apprendi applies to Johnstone's case for the additional reason that the increase in his maximum sentence was due to a prior conviction. See United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771362\"><a href=\"/opinion/771362/united-states-v-gabriel-pacheco-zepeda/\"><span class=\"volume\">234</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">411</span></a></span>, 415 (9th Cir. 2000).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> In addition, Johnstone makes two more cursory arguments, neither of which have merit. First, he contends that the felony conviction is an element of a section 1326 offense, and thus should have been separately set forth in the indictment and submitted to the jury. The Supreme Court has held, however, that section 1326(b)(2) is merely a sentencing factor, not a separate criminal offense. Almendarez-Torres v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118188\"><a href=\"/opinion/118188/almendarez-torres-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span>, 235 (1998). Second, Johnstone argues that the sentencing enhancement violates the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution; because he apparently did not make this argument below, we review only for plain error. Under that standard, we conclude that Johnstone has not shown the kind of \"gross disproportionality\" between the gravity of the criminal conduct and the severity of his sentence that an Eighth Amendment challenge requires. United States v. Cardoza, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197618\"><a href=\"/opinion/197618/united-states-v-cardoza/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir. 1997). Other courts have rejected such challenges of much longer sentences under section 1326(b). See, e.g., United States v. Cardenas-Alvarez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601814\"><a href=\"/opinion/601814/united-states-v-refugio-alberto-cardenas-alvarez/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1129</span></a></span>, 1134 (5th Cir. 1993) (100-month sentence); United States v.
