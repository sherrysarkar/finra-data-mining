Plaintiff/appellant James W.  Vogt appeals\r                           \r\r\n\nthe entry of judgment by the United States District Court for\r\n\nthe  District of  Maine for  defendants/appellees.   Vogt had\r\n\nsought  both damages  and injunctive  relief, pursuant  to 42\r\n\nU.S.C.    1983, for alleged injuries stemming  from a divorce\r\n\nand custody proceeding  in state court.   We summarily affirm\r\n\nessentially  for the reasons given by the district court.  We\r\n\nadd only the following.\r\n\n     The sole colorable constitutional issue raised in Vogt's\r\n\ncomplaint is a violation of his  right to a fair trial due to\r\n\nan  alleged conspiracy  among  appellants.   As the  district\r\n\ncourt correctly  determined,  Vogt  alleges  a  violation  of\r\n\nprocedural due process.  See Senra v. Cunningham, 9 F.3d 168,\r                                                            \r\n\n173 (1st Cir. 1993) (claim of \"'distortion and corruption  of\r\n\nthe process  of law', such  as 'falsification of  evidence or\r\n\nsome  other egregious conduct resulting in a denial of a fair\r\n\ntrial'\"  constitutes procedural  due process  claim) (quoting\r\n\nTorres  v. Superintendent of  Police, 893 F.2d  404, 410 (1st\r                                                \r\n\nCir. 1990)).  Since the state of Maine provides Vogt with  an\r\n\nadequate remedy for  any errors  in his  state trial,  either\r\n\nthrough direct  appeal or  through a motion  for relief  from\r\n\njudgment, Vogt's  claim must fail. See  Perez-Ruiz v. Crespo-\r                                                                         \r\n\nGuillen, 25  F.3d 40,  42-43  (1st Cir.  1994) (existence  of\r                   \r\n\nadequate  state postdeprivation remedy  fatal to section 1983\r\n\nprocedural due  process claim); see also  Holloway v. Walker,\r                                                                        \r\n\n784  F.2d 1287, 1290-93 (5th  Cir.)
