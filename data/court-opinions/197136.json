Chadwick Rogers was convicted of\r                                      \r\n\nconspiracy to possess marijuana  with intent to distribute in\r\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C.     846 and 841(a)(1), and  certain of\r\n\nhis property was  ordered forfeited pursuant  to 21 U.S.C.   \r\n\n853.   Rogers  appeals,  contesting both  the conviction  and\r\n\nforfeitures.   We  set  forth a  summary  of salient  events,\r\n\ndeferring certain details pertinent to specific issues.\r                      \r\n\n     In May 1992, Michael Cunniff, an undercover agent of the\r\n\nDrug  Enforcement Administration,  was  introduced to  Howard\r\n\nOberlander   in  Danvers,  Massachusetts.    Oberlander  told\r\n\nCunniff  that he was  interested in purchasing  500 pounds of\r\n\nThai marijuana with the assistance of another individual (who\r\n\nlater  turned  out  to  be  Rogers).    During  this meeting,\r\n\nOberlander telephoned  Rogers twice,  and Rogers agreed  to a\r\n\nmeeting  near  Rogers'  ranch  in California,  north  of  San\r\n\nFrancisco, to arrange the purchase.\r\n\n     Several days later, Oberlander gave Cunniff $20,000 as a\r\n\ngood faith down payment.   Then, on  June 18, 1992, both  men\r\n\nmet  Rogers in California at a neutral location.  Rogers told\r\n\nCunniff that  he  had  not  traded  \"this  kind  of  product\"\r\n\nrecently because  of the  risk of  sting operations.   Rogers\r\n\nsaid that he had an underground storage site at his ranch for\r\n\nconcealing  the  marijuana and  invited  Cunniff  to see  the\r\n\nranch.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\n     At  Rogers'  ranch, Rogers  gave Cunniff  a tour  of the\r\n\npremises.    Rogers asked  Cunniff  to  provide  some of  the\r\n\nmarijuana on credit, offering  as collateral gold, a diamond,\r\n\nand  the  title  to a  motor  home  parked  on the  property.\r\n\nOberlander gave Rogers  a small sample of  the marijuana that\r\n\nCunniff  had earlier  provided  to Oberlander.   The  meeting\r\n\nended without a final agreement between Rogers and Cunniff on\r\n\nthe terms of the sale.\r\n\n     On the following day, Oberlander and Cunniff returned to\r\n\nRogers' ranch.   Rogers agreed  to the terms  of the sale  to\r\n\ncomplete  the  transaction.     Those  terms,   discussed  in\r\n\nintervening telephone  calls, were that Cunniff would \"front\"\r\n\nthe entire 500-pound shipment of marijuana in return for  the\r\n\ncollateral that Rogers  had offered.  But  during this second\r\n\nvisit, Rogers noticed an airplane circling over the ranch and\r\n\ntold Oberlander and  Cunniff to leave  for dinner and  return\r\n\nlater that evening.\r\n\n     The   airplane  was  a  DEA  surveillance  plane,  which\r\n\nfollowed Cunniff's car as  he and Oberlander drove  away from\r\n\nthe ranch.  From a gas station, Oberlander telephoned Rogers,\r\n\nwho said that the  plane had followed Cunniff's car  and that\r\n\nlaw enforcement agents had probably planted a tracking device\r\n\nin the car.  Rogers  told Oberlander that he did not  want to\r\n\ncomplete the transaction, that Oberlander and Cunniff  should\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nleave town  and (according to Rogers'  testimony) that Rogers\r\n\nnever wanted to see them again.\r\n\n     Cunniff  then  met  with  surveillance  agents  and  had\r\n\nOberlander arrested.  Cunniff and more than two dozen DEA and\r\n\nlocal agents  returned to  Rogers' ranch and  arrested Rogers\r\n\npursuant  to a  federal  arrest warrant.   Earlier  that day,\r\n\nagents  had also  obtained a  search warrant  authorizing the\r\n\nseizure  of property intended  to be  used to  commit federal\r\n\ndrug offenses.  Pursuant  to this search warrant, the  agents\r\n\nsearched Rogers' ranch and discovered the hidden  underground\r\n\nbunker. \r\n\n     During the search, agents  pressed Rogers to  cooperate,\r                                                    \r\n\nalthough he  had said that he wished to remain silent.  After\r\n\nbeing  held at  his ranch  in handcuffs  for over  two hours,\r\n\nRogers revealed  the location of  a hidden floor  safe, built\r\n\nunderneath  a desk  in his  library.   The agents  opened the\r\n\nsafe,  which contained  currency, a  large diamond  ring, and\r\n\ngold Krugerrands worth about $5,000.\r\n\n     After a  jury trial, Rogers was  convicted of conspiracy\r\n\nto possess  marijuana with  intent to distribute.   The  jury\r\n\nthen considered the forfeiture count in a bifurcated hearing,\r\n\nand in  accord with the jury's special  verdict the following\r\n\nproperty  was forfeited:   Rogers'  ranch and  adjoining real\r\n\nproperty,  the motor home, a dozen  gold Kruggerands, and the\r\n\ndiamond.    The   judge  imposed  a  sentence  of  90  months\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nimprisonment and a $12,500 fine.  Rogers now appeals both the\r\n\nconviction and sentence.\r\n\n     1.   Rogers' first claim, addressed  to his convictions,\r\n\nrests  on the premise that he withdrew from the conspiracy by\r\n\ntelling Cunniff and Oberlander to  leave town and not contact\r\n\nhim  again.    His  own unrebutted  testimony,  Rogers  says,\r\n\nrequired the district  court to grant  his motion to  dismiss\r\n\nunder  Fed. R.  Crim.  P. 29,  and, alternatively,  supported\r\n\nRogers'  request   for  an  instruction  to   the  jury  that\r\n\nwithdrawal  from  the conspiracy  constituted  an affirmative\r\n\ndefense to the charge.   The district court had  refused both\r\n\napplications.\r\n\n     In  addition  to procedural  objections,  the government\r\n\nprotests   that  the   evidence  does   not  come   close  to\r\n\nestablishing  a  bona fide  withdrawal  from  the conspiracy.\r\n\nRogers, it says, was merely deferring efforts to transfer the\r\n\ndrugs  or  was  feigning   withdrawal.    Still,  if  Rogers'\r\n\ntestimony  were believed by the  jury, the jury  might find a\r\n\nwithdrawal  by Rogers  grounded  in \"a  communication by  the\r\n\naccused  to his  co-conspirators  that he  has abandoned  the\r\n\nenterprise and  its goals.\"   United States v.  Juodakis, 834\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 1099, 1102 (1st Cir. 1987).\r\n\n     But withdrawal is  not a defense to  a conspiracy charge\r\n\nif  the  conspiracy violation  has  already  occurred.   \"The\r\n\ntraditional  rule here `is strict  and inflexible:  since the\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\ncrime is  complete with  the agreement, no  subsequent action\r\n\ncan exonerate the conspirator of that crime.'\"  2 W. LaFave &amp;\r\n\nA. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law   6.5 (1986) (quoting ALI,\r                                              \r\n\nModel Penal Code   5.03, comment at 457 (1985)).   See, e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nUnited States v.  Nava-Salazar, 30 F.3d 788,  799 (7th Cir.),\r                                          \r\n\ncert. denied, 115 S.  Ct. 515 (1994).  Some  statutes require\r                        \r\n\nan overt act, but section 846 does not.  See United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nShabani, 115 S. Ct. 382, 385 (1994).\r                   \r\n\n     True, withdrawal may carry a variety of advantages for a\r\n\ndefendant.  It may insulate him  from Pinkerton liability for\r                                                           \r\n\nsubstantive crimes of others that occur after his withdrawal.\r\n\nUnited  States v.  O'Campo,  973 F.2d  1015,  1021 (1st  Cir.\r                                      \r\n\n1992).  It can prevent admission against him of statements by\r\n\nco-conspirators made  after this point.   E.g., United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.  Abou-Saada, 785 F.2d 1,  8 (1st Cir.),  cert. denied, 477\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. 908 (1986).  It will  normally start the running of  the\r\n\nstatute  of limitations.  E.g., United States v. Sax, 39 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n1380,  1386 (7th  Cir.  1994).   But  none of  these  rubrics\r\n\napplies in this case.\r\n\n     Rogers  contends that  two  of  our earlier  decisions--\r\n\nUnited  States v.  Piva, 870  F.2d 753  (1st Cir.  1989), and\r                                   \r\n\nUnited States v. Dyer, 821 F.2d 35 (1st Cir. 1987)--create an\r                                 \r\n\nexception in the First Circuit to the usual conspiracy rules.\r\n\nThese cases, he says,  make withdrawal an affirmative defense\r\n\neven if  the conspiratorial agreement has  already been made.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nAnd he urges  that recognizing such  a defense serves  public\r\n\npolicy by encouraging withdrawal from conspiracies.\r\n\n     We agree  with Rogers  that Dyer  and Piva  contain some\r                                                           \r\n\nambiguities.   But  neither case offers  a square  holding in\r\n\nRogers'   favor,  and   such  a   holding  would   be  flatly\r\n\ninconsistent  with the  settled  view  that a  conspiratorial\r\n\nagreement  is itself a punishable  act because of the dangers\r\n\ncreated by  such  a criminal  enterprise.   United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nMoran, 984 F.2d 1299, 1302-03 (1st Cir. 1993).   If there has\r                 \r\n\nbeen a misunderstanding, it is now resolved.\r\n\n     2.   Rogers  claims that  the  district court  erred  in\r\n\nrefusing  to give the jury  an instruction on  entrapment.  A\r\n\ndefendant is entitled to such an instruction if the evidence,\r\n\nviewed in  the light most  favorable to the  defendant, would\r\n\n\"create a  reasonable doubt  as to whether  government actors\r\n\ninduced the defendant to  perform a criminal act that  he was\r\n\nnot predisposed to commit.\"  United States  v. Rodriguez, 858\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d  809, 814  (1st  Cir. 1988).    This elliptical  summary\r\n\ncondenses  two different  matters--one of  substance  and the\r\n\nother of proof.\r\n\n     The first substantive element  of an entrapment claim is\r\n\nmade out where  a government agent  exerts undue pressure  or\r                                                            \r\n\ninducement  to persuade  the defendant  to commit  the crime.\r\n\nUnited  States v. Acosta, 67  F.3d 334, 337  (1st Cir. 1995),\r                                    \r\n\ncert.  denied,  116 S.  Ct.  965  (1996);  United  States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\nGendron, 18 F.3d 955, 961-62 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 115 S.\r                                                                 \r\n\nCt.  654  (1994).    In  addition,  even  undue  pressure  or\r\n\ninducement  is irrelevant  where  the defendant  was  already\r\n\npredisposed   to   commit  the   crime.      Thus,  lack   of\r\n\npredisposition  is   the   second  substantive   element   of\r\n\nentrapment.  Gendron, 18 F.3d at 962.\r                                \r\n\n     As to proof, the defendant must make a threshold showing\r\n\nin order  to  raise the  entrapment  issue; after  that,  the\r\n\nburden  shifts  to the  government  to  negate entrapment  by\r\n\nproving, beyond a reasonable doubt, that no improper pressure\r\n\nor  inducement was used or that the defendant was predisposed\r                                      \r\n\nto commit  the  offense.    Acosta, 67  F.3d  at  338.    But\r                                              \r\n\nentrapment  may  not  be   argued,  nor  is  any  instruction\r\n\nrequired, unless  the defendant  points to evidence  that, if\r\n\nbelieved by the jury, would permit such a reasonable doubt on\r\n\nboth elements.  Rodriguez, 858 F.2d at 814.\r                                     \r\n\n     In  this  case,  when  Rogers asked  for  an  entrapment\r\n\ninstruction,  the  district  court  after the  close  of  the\r\n\nevidence ruled that there  was enough evidence to  permit the\r\n\njury to have a reasonable doubt as to Rogers' predisposition.\r\n\nThis  might  seem  surprising  in view  of  Rogers'  apparent\r\n\nsophistication  and  his  underground  bunker.    But  Rogers\r\n\nhimself testified that he had  never been a marijuana dealer,\r\n\nand issues of credibility are  largely for the jury.   In all\r\n\nevents, the government does not contest the point.\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\n     The district  court also ruled, however,  that there was\r\n\nno threshold-level  evidence  that the  government  had  used\r\n\nimproper pressure or inducement to cause Rogers to commit the\r\n\ncrime;  and on that ground  it refused to  give an entrapment\r\n\ninstruction.  We review such  rulings de novo, Rodriguez, 858\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d at  812, so the question  for us is the  same:  whether,\r\n\nviewing  the evidence in the  light most favorable to Rogers,\r\n\nthere was enough evidence  of improper pressure or inducement\r\n\nto take the issue to the jury.  \r\n\n     Rogers' most  direct route to the  necessary showing was\r\n\nhis  own  trial testimony  that  Oberlander  had hassled  and\r\n\nharangued  him.    Since  most of  their  conversations  were\r\n\nunrecorded and  Oberlander was  not a  cooperating government\r\n\nwitness,  the  government  could  not  directly  refute  this\r\n\ntestimony.  But the entrapment \"defense\" applies only  if the\r\n\nimproper  inducement  derives  from  the  government.   E.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nUnited  States v.

Under the case law the government would\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\nbe  responsible  if  Cunniff  told Oberlander  to  apply  the\r                                              \r\n\npressure or inducement later  deemed improper, and perhaps if\r\n\nCunniff  knowingly  tolerated it,  but  not  if Cunniff  were\r\n\nignorant of it.  United States v. Bradley, 820 F.2d 3, 8 (1st\r                                                     \r\n\nCir.  1987).    The  district  court  ruled  that  there  was\r\n\ninsufficient  evidence  associating  Cunniff  with  any  such\r\n\nconduct by Oberlander.\r\n\n     We agree.  Assuming  that Oberlander did act improperly,\r\n\nnothing in  the record shows that Cunniff urged, suggested or\r\n\nwas even aware of such conduct.  About the worst that emerges\r\n\nis  a single statement by Cunniff, telling Oberlander to \"put\r\n\nsome heat on [Rogers].\"   This statement was made  as Cunniff\r\n\nand Oberlander drove  away from the  ranch after their  first\r\n\nvisit when negotiations had  bogged down over whether Cunniff\r\n\nwould \"front\" the drugs  or obtain payment from Rogers.   The\r\n\ncomment  is far less sinister than the suggestion of an agent\r\n\nthat the intermediary put \"the arm\" on a target, Bradley, 820\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d at 7, a phrase implying force or the threat of force.\r\n\n     In the  alternative, Rogers contends that the undisputed\r\n\nfacts alone were enough to get to the  jury on entrapment, in\r\n\npart because the government \"targeted\" Rogers and pursued him\r\n\nwith excessive zeal.  But the DEA did not seek  out Rogers as\r\n\nan  individual--Oberlander did--and based  on a few telephone\r\n\ncalls, Rogers proved ready  enough to enter into talks.   His\r\n\nonly resistance was not to the  idea of the crime, but rather\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\nto the  risks and the  terms.  That  the negotiations  took a\r\n\ngood many  calls  proves  nothing.    See  United  States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nGifford, 17 F.3d 462, 468 (1st Cir. 1994).   \r                   \r\n\n     The other strand to Rogers' undisputed-facts argument is\r\n\nthat the  terms offered  were unduly  attractive:   that Thai\r\n\nmarijuana was an attractive product that was hard  to obtain,\r\n\nthat it was offered  to Rogers on credit for  collateral (the\r\n\ngold,  diamond  and motor  home) valued  at  \"about 20  to 25\r\n\npercent of the value of the marijuana,\" and that Rogers stood\r\n\nto profit by as much as 10 to 20  percent of the sales price.\r\n\nThis, says Rogers' brief, was \"an irresistibly lucrative deal\r\n\nfor  a  rare and  highly  prestigious  product at  a  `cheap'\r\n\nprice.\"\r\n\n     The fact that the product was  rare is of little help to\r\n\nRogers; a  receiver of stolen  art can  certainly be  tempted\r\n\nwith a  Rembrandt.    Something more  might  be  made--in  an\r\n\nextreme case--of extraordinarily favorable terms of credit or\r\n\na price drastically below market levels.  E.g., United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Casanova,  970 F.2d 371, 376  (7th Cir. 1992).   But it is\r                       \r\n\nenough to  say that  Rogers offered no  substantial evidence,\r\n\nonly  lawyer's conjecture,  that  the  deal was  irresistibly\r\n\nattractive.   Compare United States v. Mosley,  965 F.2d 906,\r                                                         \r\n\n913 (10th Cir. 1992).\r\n\n     3.  Rogers' final attack on his conviction  concerns the\r\n\nadmission  of  items recovered  from  his  safe.    The  most\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\ndamaging were a  diamond and a  number of Krugerrands;  their\r\n\npresence dovetailed with Cunniff's testimony that  Rogers had\r\n\noffered such items, along with  the motor home, as collateral\r\n\nfor the drugs.  Although Rogers moved to exclude the evidence\r\n\nas  illegally seized,  the district  court denied  the motion\r\n\nafter a pre-trial hearing.\r\n\n     The district court first ruled that the discovery of the\r\n\nsafe was the product of illegal questioning.  Although Rogers\r\n\nhad  been given  Miranda warnings,  the court found  that the\r                                    \r\n\nagents  had  continued to  press  Rogers after  he  sought to\r\n\nremain  silent.  However, the court also found that the large\r\n\nteam  of  about two  dozen  agents,  who were  searching  the\r\n\npremises under a  search warrant, would  have found the  safe\r\n\nwithout  Rogers'  help;  the  court  therefore  admitted  the\r\n\nevidence under  the \"inevitable discovery\" doctrine.   Nix v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nWilliams, 467 U.S. 431 (1984).\r                    \r\n\n     The safe was concealed in the concrete  floor of Rogers'\r\n\nlibrary,  covered by a built-in desk and drawer.  Whether the\r\n\nsafe could have been  located short of tearing up the desk is\r\n\nnot clear from the record.  Rogers says  that the agents were\r\n\nabandoning  the  search  when   Rogers  revealed  the  safe's\r\n\nlocation.   The government,  by contrast, stresses  the large\r\n\nnumber of agents in the  search; their success in discovering\r\n\nthe concealed underground storage bunker; their knowledge  of\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                         -12-\r\r\n\nthe diamond and gold; and the inferred likelihood that absent\r\n\nRogers' help the search would have continued.\r\n\n     The  term   \"inevitable,\"  although  part   of  the  Nix\r                                                                         \r\n\ndoctrine's name, is something of an overstatement.  The facts\r\n\nof Nix itself--a body hidden in an area of many square miles-\r                  \r\n\n-show  that what is required  is a high  probability that the\r\n\nevidence would  have been  discovered by  lawful means.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nalso United States  v.

The\r                                    \r\n\nprobability  has not  been quantified,  but it  only confuses\r\n\nmatters  to  pretend that  the  government  must  prove to  a\r\n\ncertainty  what would  have  happened but  for the  illegally\r\n\nobtained admission.\r\n\n     Normally,  on a  close question  like this,  a reviewing\r\n\ncourt will defer to the trial court where the latter has made\r\n\na  fact-intensive judgment  (here,  as to  the likelihood  of\r\n\nindependent  discovery) resting  on a  plausible view  of the\r\n\nevidence.   United States v. McLaughlin, 957 F.2d 12, 16 (1st\r                                                   \r\n\nCir. 1992).  The  Supreme Court's recent decision  in Ornelas\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.  United States, 116 S.

But\r\n\nwe  do  have some  concern  about  Rogers' unanswered  claim,\r\n\ndebatably supported by a record citation, that the search was\r\n\nbeing abandoned when Rogers revealed the sale.\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                         -13-\r\r\n\n     Rather than pursue this loose end,  we affirm instead on\r\n\nthe  ground that if admission  of the evidence  was error, it\r\n\nwas  harmless   beyond  a  reasonable  doubt.     Chapman  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nCalifornia, 386 U.S.  18 (1967).   The government's case  was\r                      \r\n\nstraightforward, based on direct  testimony from Cunniff  and\r\n\nbuttressed   by  tape   recordings  and   telephone  records.\r\n\nMoreover,  Rogers did not deny  most of what Cunniff related.\r\n\nInstead,  Rogers sought to convince the jury that he had been\r\n\nplay-acting and  intended only to string  Cunniff along until\r\n\nOberlander recovered his $20,000 downpayment.\r\n\n     Against  this  background, the  diamond  and gold  coins\r\n\nadded color  but very little  more to the  government's case.\r\n\nRogers asserts  that this evidence undermined  his claim that\r\n\nhe was only pretending an interest in buying drugs, but it is\r\n\ndifficult  to see  why this is  so.   Even a  pretending drug\r\n\npurchaser--for  reasons of  prudence alone--would  have ample\r\n\nreason  to name collateral that could be produced if a demand\r\n\nto see it were  made.  With  or without physical evidence  of\r\n\nthe  collateral,  Rogers'  defense  of  pretense  was  simply\r\n\nimplausible.\r\n\n     4.  Rogers' remaining  claims concern the forfeitures of\r\n\nthe ranch,  the diamond, the gold Krugerrands,  and the motor\r\n\nhome.  Criminal  forfeiture in  drug cases is  covered by  21\r\n\nU.S.C.   853, which  provides that any person convicted  of a\r\n\nspecified set  of offenses  shall  forfeit proceeds  obtained\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                         -14-\r\r\n\nfrom  the  violation and  property of  the defendant  used or\r\n\nintended  to be used  to commit or  facilitate the violation.\r\n\nRogers contests the judgment of forfeiture on three different\r\n\ngrounds.  \r\n\n     First, Rogers  contends that  the district court  should\r\n\nhave instructed  the  jury  that  the facts  to  support  the\r\n\nforfeiture must be found  beyond a reasonable doubt; instead,\r\n\nthe  judge  told  the jury  to  use  a  preponderance of  the\r\n\nevidence  standard   to  find  the  facts   incident  to  the\r\n\nforfeiture.   This  lesser standard,  of course,  is directed\r\n\nonly to  facts  other than  the  predicate finding  that  the\r\n\ndefendant  had engaged  in a  drug crime,  an issue  which is\r\n\nordinarily resolved by the criminal conviction itself.\r\n\n     By practice, criminal forfeitures  are determined by the\r\n\njury.   The Federal Rules of  Criminal Procedure provide that\r\n\nthe  indictment or  information must  allege the  interest or\r\n\nproperty subject  to criminal forfeiture and  that a \"special\r\n\nverdict\" shall be returned  as to the extent of  the interest\r\n\nor property subject to forfeiture, if any.  See Fed. R. Crim.\r                                                           \r\n\nP.  7(c)(2),  31(e).   Nevertheless,  the  Supreme Court  has\r\n\nconcluded  that the  forfeiture is  part of  the sanction  or\r\n\npenalty and  not an independent offense.   Libretti v. United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates, 116  S. Ct. 356,  363 (1995); cf. 21  U.S.C.   853(a)\r                                                     \r\n\n(final paragraph).\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                         -15-\r\r\n\n     Against this background,  almost every circuit that  has\r\n\npronounced on  the issue has held the standard of proof as to\r\n\nforfeiture issues under section 853  (other than the proof of\r\n\na predicate  violation) is  a preponderance of  the evidence.\r\n\nSee,  e.g., United States v. Tanner, 61 F.3d 231, 234-35 (4th\r                                               \r\n\nCir.  1995), cert.  denied,  116 S.

The principal reason given by the decisions\r\n\nis that findings relating  to penalty or sanction are  a part\r\n\nof    sentencing;    and   sentencing    determinations   are\r\n\ntraditionally based on a preponderance, not on proof beyond a\r\n\nreasonable  doubt.

McCarthy,  77 F.3d 522,\r                                                          \r\n\n525  (1st Cir.),  cert. denied,  65 U.S.L.W.  3368 (Nov.  18,\r                                          \r\n\n1996) (No. 95-9302).     Although Congress  could provide for\r\n\na  more stringent standard, it  has certainly not  done so in\r\n\nsection 853.  On the contrary, it has adopted (in 21 U.S.C.  \r\n\n853(d)) a  presumption  provision whose  terms  suggest  that\r\n\nCongress assumed that a  preponderance standard would be used\r\n\nin deciding forfeiture issues under that section.  See United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Elgersma,  971 F.2d 690,  694-95 (llth Cir.  1992).\r                              \r\n\nStill,  Congress' assumptions  are  not  enactments, and  one\r\n\ncould argue that Congress  left the burden of proof  issue to\r\n\nthe judiciary, as it does with many procedural details.  \r\n\n     If so, we  see no  reason to depart  from the  consensus\r\n\nview that  criminal forfeiture,  being a penalty  or sanction\r\n\nissue   under  section   853,   is  governed   by  the   same\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                         -16-\r\r\n\npreponderance standard that  applies to all other  sentencing\r\n\nissues.   The happenstance that the issue is submitted to the\r\n\njury may complicate the process of instructing jurors and has\r\n\nbeen offered as a  reason for bifurcating the trial.   United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Desmarais,  938 F.2d 347, 349 (1st Cir. 1991).  But\r                               \r\n\nin  most other respects, the criminal forfeiture is akin to a\r\n\njail  sentence or a fine  and lacks the  historical and moral\r\n\nroots  that  have led  to a  higher  proof requirement  for a\r\n\nfinding of criminal guilt.\r\n\n     Rogers' second objection is that the property  forfeited\r\n\ndoes  not fall  within the  statutory definition  of property\r\n\nsubject  to forfeiture  under  section 853(a).   The  statute\r\n\nprovides  inter  alia  that  property  may  be  forfeited  if\r                                 \r\n\n\"intended to  be used . .  . to commit, or  to facilitate the\r\n\ncommission of,  such violation  [the violation for  which the\r\n\ndefendant was convicted].\"   21 U.S.C.    853(a)(2).   Rogers\r\n\ncontends  that,  the  gravamen  of the  conspiracy  being  an\r\n\nagreement,  there was  no showing  that any of  the forfeited\r\n\nproperty  was used  or  intended to  be  used to  create  the\r\n\nagreement.\r\n\n     The argument  is technical but not  without some weight.\r\n\nIt can certainly  be said, as a matter of  language, that the\r\n\ngist of an agreement is an understanding communicated by word\r\n\nor action, so that while Rogers' telephone [instrument] might\r\n\nbe property used  to commit the  offense, the diamond,  coins\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                         -17-\r\r\n\nand motor home did not play an actual or  prospective role in\r\n\n\"such violation.\"  This is a harder argument for Rogers as to\r\n\nthe ranch since it was the place where the agreement was made\r\n\nand  so arguably  facilitated  the agreement.   E.g.,  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Lewis, 987 F.2d 1349, 1356 (8th Cir. 1993).\r                           \r\n\n     But  as to  the collateral,  Rogers can  colorably argue\r\n\nthat  the agreement  was  made--and therefore  the crime  was\r\n\ninitially committed--without any direct \"use\" of the diamond,\r\n\ncoins  or  motor  home.    Counter-arguments  are  available,\r\n\nassuming  a broad usage of the word \"use,\" showing once again\r\n\nthat language is  not a precise instrument.  But  we think it\r\n\nis permissible as a matter of language, and sound as a matter\r\n\nof legislative policy, to uphold the forfeiture on the ground\r\n\nthat  the forfeited  property was  \"intended to  be used\"  in\r\n\ncarrying out the agreement.  \r\n\n     True, the carrying out of the agreement would constitute\r\n\na  separate  crime--possession  by  Rogers  with  intent   to\r\n\ndistribute--which is not the \"such violation\"  referred to by\r\n\nthe statute.   But it is  also true that the  carrying out of\r\n\nthe agreement would comprise a continuation of the conspiracy\r\n\nitself (\"such violation\").  United States v. Brandon, 17 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n409,  451  (1st Cir.),  cert. denied,  115  S. Ct.  80 (1994)\r                                                \r\n\n(conspiracy may  be a  continuing agreement).   The agreement\r\n\nwould be reaffirmed and maintained, and could be so proved at\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                         -18-\r\r\n\ntrial,  by the  very  uses  of  the  diamond  and  money  (as\r\n\ncollateral) and of the ranch (to hide the drugs).\r\n\n     Sound  policy points  in the  same direction.   Although\r\n\nsection  853 is  a  criminal  penalty,  it is  apparent  that\r\n\nCongress was  endeavoring not only to  increase punishment of\r\n\ndrug  offenses but  also  to discourage  them by  making them\r\n\nhighly  unprofitable.    In that  spirit,  section  853(a)(2)\r\n\ndefines the property to be forfeited quite broadly (\"used, or\r\n\nintended to be used, in any  manner or part, to commit, or to\r\n\nfacilitate\"), and  the statute further  provides that  \"[t]he\r\n\nprovisions of  this section  shall be liberally  construed to\r\n\neffectuate its remedial purposes.\"  21 U.S.C.   853(o).\r\n\n     Finally,   Rogers   argues,  in   connection   with  the\r\n\nforfeiture  as well  as conviction,  that the  property taken\r\n\nfrom the safe was not properly admitted under  the inevitable\r\n\ndiscovery  doctrine.    Whether  or not  our  harmless  error\r\n\nanalysis  would work as  well in  relation to  the forfeiture\r\n\ncounts is a debatable issue, but we need not resolve it.  For\r\n\nit is settled that  even an illegal seizure of  property does\r\n\nnot protect it  against forfeiture so long as  the government\r\n\ncan sustain  the forfeiture claim with  independent evidence.\r\n\nINS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1040 (1984).\r                                \r\n\n     This latter  requirement  is easily  satisfied  in  this\r\n\ncase.  Cunniff gave direct testimony that Rogers  had offered\r\n\nthe diamond, gold and motor home  as a part of the collateral\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                         -19-\r\r\n\nfor  fronting the  marijuana, and  there was  some additional\r\n\nsupporting  evidence to this effect.  It is apparent from the\r\n\nverdict that the jury accepted Cunniff's testimony and, as we\r\n\nalready noted,  the actual presence of the  diamond, gold and\r\n\nmotor  home most  certainly contributed  very little  to this\r\n\nresult.\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                         \r\n\n                             -20-\r                                         -20-\r\r\n",

Rogers appeals, contesting both the conviction and forfeitures.  We set forth a summary of salient events, deferring certain details pertinent to specific issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1992, Michael Cunniff, an undercover agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration, was introduced to Howard Oberlander in Danvers, Massachusetts.  Oberlander told Cunniff that he was interested in purchasing 500 pounds of Thai marijuana with the assistance of another individual (who later turned out to be Rogers).  During this meeting, Oberlander telephoned Rogers twice, and Rogers agreed to a meeting near Rogers' ranch in California, north of San Francisco, to arrange the purchase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several days later, Oberlander gave Cunniff $20,000 as a good faith down payment.  Then, on June 18, 1992, both men met Rogers in California at a neutral location.  Rogers told Cunniff that he had not traded \"this kind of product\" recently because of the risk of sting operations.  Rogers said that he had an underground storage site at his ranch for concealing the marijuana and invited Cunniff to see the ranch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At Rogers' ranch, Rogers gave Cunniff a tour of the premises.  Rogers asked Cunniff to provide some of the marijuana on credit, offering as collateral gold, a diamond, and the title to a motor home parked on the property.  Oberlander gave Rogers a small sample of the marijuana that Cunniff had earlier provided to Oberlander.  The meeting ended without a final agreement between Rogers and Cunniff on the terms of the sale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the following day, Oberlander and Cunniff returned to Rogers' ranch.  Rogers agreed to the terms of the sale to complete the transaction.  Those terms, discussed in intervening telephone calls, were that Cunniff would \"front\" the entire 500-pound shipment of marijuana in return for the collateral that Rogers had offered.  But during this second visit, Rogers noticed an airplane circling over the ranch and told Oberlander and Cunniff to leave for dinner and return later that evening.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The airplane was a DEA surveillance plane, which followed Cunniff's car as he and Oberlander drove away from the ranch.  From a gas station, Oberlander telephoned Rogers, who said that the plane had followed Cunniff's car and that law enforcement agents had probably planted a tracking device in the car.  Rogers told Oberlander that he did not want to complete the transaction, that Oberlander and Cunniff should leave town and (according to Rogers' testimony) that Rogers never wanted to see them again.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cunniff then met with surveillance agents and had Oberlander arrested.  Cunniff and more than two dozen DEA and local agents returned to Rogers' ranch and arrested Rogers pursuant to a federal arrest warrant.  Earlier that day, agents had also obtained a search warrant authorizing the seizure of property intended to be used to commit federal drug offenses.  Pursuant to this search warrant, the agents searched Rogers' ranch and discovered the hidden underground bunker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the search, agents pressed Rogers to cooperate, although he had said that he wished to remain silent.  After being held at his ranch in handcuffs for over two hours, Rogers revealed the location of a hidden floor safe, built underneath a desk in his library.  The agents opened the safe, which contained currency, a large diamond ring, and gold Krugerrands worth about $5,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a jury trial, Rogers was convicted of conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to distribute.  The jury then considered the forfeiture count in a bifurcated hearing, and in accord with the jury's special verdict the following property was forfeited:  Rogers' ranch and adjoining real property, the motor home, a dozen gold Kruggerands, and the diamond.  The judge imposed a sentence of 90 months imprisonment and a $12,500 fine.  Rogers now appeals both the conviction and sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Rogers' first claim, addressed to his convictions, rests on the premise that he withdrew from the conspiracy by telling Cunniff and Oberlander to leave town and not contact him again.  His own unrebutted testimony, Rogers says, required the district court to grant his motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Crim.P. 29, and, alternatively, supported Rogers' request for an instruction to the jury that withdrawal from the conspiracy constituted an affirmative defense to the charge.  The district court had refused both applications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to procedural objections, the government protests that the evidence does not come close to establishing a bona fide withdrawal from the conspiracy.  Rogers, it says, was merely deferring efforts to transfer the drugs or was feigning withdrawal.  Still, if Rogers' testimony were believed by the jury, the jury might find a withdrawal by Rogers grounded in \"a communication by the accused to his coconspirators that he has abandoned the enterprise and its goals.\"  United States v. Juodakis, 834 F.2d 1099, 1102 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But withdrawal is not a defense to a conspiracy charge if the conspiracy violation has already occurred.  \"The traditional rule here 'is strict and inflexible:  since the crime is complete with the agreement, no subsequent action can exonerate the conspirator of that crime.' \"   2 W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law &#167; 6.5 (1986) (quoting ALI, Model Penal Code &#167; 5.03, comment at 457 (1985)).  See, e.g., United States v. Nava-Salazar, 30 F.3d 788, 799 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1002, 115 S.Ct. 515, 130 L.Ed.2d 421 (1994).  Some statutes require an overt act, but section 846 does not.  See United States v. Shabani, 513 U.S. 10, ----, 115 S.Ct. 382, 385, 130 L.Ed.2d 225 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">True, withdrawal may carry a variety of advantages for a defendant.  It may insulate him from Pinkerton liability for substantive crimes of others that occur after his withdrawal.  United States v. O'Campo, 973 F.2d 1015, 1021 (1st Cir.1992).  It can prevent admission against him of statements by coconspirators made after this point.  E.g., United States v. Abou-Saada, 785 F.2d 1, 8 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 477 U.S. 908, 106 S.Ct. 3283, 91 L.Ed.2d 572 (1986).  It will normally start the running of the statute of limitations.  E.g., United States v. Sax, 39 F.3d 1380, 1386 (7th Cir.1994).  But none of these rubrics applies in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rogers contends that two of our earlier decisions--United States v. Piva, 870 F.2d 753 (1st Cir.1989), and United States v. Dyer, 821 F.2d 35 (1st Cir.1987)--create an exception in the First Circuit to the usual conspiracy rules.  These cases, he says, make withdrawal an affirmative defense even if the conspiratorial agreement has already been made.  And he urges that recognizing such a defense serves public policy by encouraging withdrawal from conspiracies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with Rogers that Dyer and Piva contain some ambiguities.  But neither case offers a square holding in Rogers' favor, and such a holding would be flatly inconsistent with the settled view that a conspiratorial agreement is itself a punishable act because of the dangers created by such a criminal enterprise.  United States v. Moran, 984 F.2d 1299, 1302-03 (1st Cir.1993).  If there has been a misunderstanding, it is now resolved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Rogers claims that the district court erred in refusing to give the jury an instruction on entrapment.  A defendant is entitled to such an instruction if the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the defendant, would \"create a reasonable doubt as to whether government actors induced the defendant to perform a criminal act that he was not predisposed to commit.\"  United States v. Rodriguez, 858 F.2d 809, 814 (1st Cir.1988).  This elliptical summary condenses two different matters--one of substance and the other of proof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first substantive element of an entrapment claim is made out where a government agent exerts undue pressure or inducement to persuade the defendant to commit the crime.  United States v. Acosta, 67 F.3d 334, 337 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 965, 133 L.Ed.2d 887 (1996);  United States v. Gendron, 18 F.3d 955, 961-62 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1051, 115 S.Ct. 654, 130 L.Ed.2d 558 (1994).  In addition, even undue pressure or inducement is irrelevant where the defendant was already predisposed to commit the crime.  Thus, lack of predisposition is the second substantive element of entrapment.  Gendron, 18 F.3d at 962.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to proof, the defendant must make a threshold showing in order to raise the entrapment issue;  after that, the burden shifts to the government to negate entrapment by proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, that no improper pressure or inducement was used or that the defendant was predisposed to commit the offense.  Acosta, 67 F.3d at 338.   But entrapment may not be argued, nor is any instruction required, unless the defendant points to evidence that, if believed by the jury, would permit such a reasonable doubt on both elements.  Rodriguez, 858 F.2d at 814.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, when Rogers asked for an entrapment instruction, the district court after the close of the evidence ruled that there was enough evidence to permit the jury to have a reasonable doubt as to Rogers' predisposition.  This might seem surprising in view of Rogers' apparent sophistication and his underground bunker.  But Rogers himself testified that he had never been a marijuana dealer, and issues of credibility are largely for the jury.  In all events, the government does not contest the point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also ruled, however, that there was no threshold-level evidence that the government had used improper pressure or inducement to cause Rogers to commit the crime;  and on that ground it refused to give an entrapment instruction.  We review such rulings de novo, Rodriguez, 858 F.2d at 812, so the question for us is the same:  whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Rogers, there was enough evidence of improper pressure or inducement to take the issue to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rogers' most direct route to the necessary showing was his own trial testimony that Oberlander had hassled and harangued him.  Since most of their conversations were unrecorded and Oberlander was not a cooperating government witness, the government could not directly refute this testimony.  But the entrapment \"defense\" applies only if the improper inducement derives from the government.  E.g., United States v. Coady, 809 F.2d 119, 122 (1st Cir.1987).  Otherwise, the defendant has available only more difficult-to-prove defenses such as coercion and necessity which were not invoked by Rogers in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rogers' response is that Oberlander should be treated as an \"unwitting government agent.\"   See United States v. Valencia, 645 F.2d 1158, 1168-69 (2d Cir.1980);  Note, 95 Harv.L.Rev. 1122 (1982).  This is an image likely to mislead the reader.  Under the case law the government would be responsible if Cunniff told Oberlander to apply the pressure or inducement later deemed improper, and perhaps if Cunniff knowingly tolerated it, but not if Cunniff were ignorant of it.  United States v. Bradley, 820 F.2d 3, 8 (1st Cir.1987).  The district court ruled that there was insufficient evidence associating Cunniff with any such conduct by Oberlander.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree.  Assuming that Oberlander did act improperly, nothing in the record shows that Cunniff urged, suggested or was even aware of such conduct.  About the worst that emerges is a single statement by Cunniff, telling Oberlander to \"put some heat on [Rogers].\"  This statement was made as Cunniff and Oberlander drove away from the ranch after their first visit when negotiations had bogged down over whether Cunniff would \"front\" the drugs or obtain payment from Rogers.  The comment is far less sinister than the suggestion of an agent that the intermediary put \"the arm\" on a target, Bradley, 820 F.2d at 7, a phrase implying force or the threat of force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the alternative, Rogers contends that the undisputed facts alone were enough to get to the jury on entrapment, in part because the government \"targeted\" Rogers and pursued him with excessive zeal.  But the DEA did not seek out Rogers as an individual--Oberlander did--and based on a few telephone calls, Rogers proved ready enough to enter into talks.  His only resistance was not to the idea of the crime, but rather to the risks and the terms.  That the negotiations took a good many calls proves nothing.  See United States v. Gifford, 17 F.3d 462, 468 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other strand to Rogers' undisputed-facts argument is that the terms offered were unduly attractive:  that Thai marijuana was an attractive product that was hard to obtain, that it was offered to Rogers on credit for collateral (the gold, diamond and motor home) valued at \"about 20 to 25 percent of the value of the marijuana,\" and that Rogers stood to profit by as much as 10 to 20 percent of the sales price.  This, says Rogers' brief, was \"an irresistibly lucrative deal for a rare and highly prestigious product at a 'cheap' price.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that the product was rare is of little help to Rogers;  a receiver of stolen art can certainly be tempted with a Rembrandt.  Something more might be made--in an extreme case-of extraordinarily favorable terms of credit or a price drastically below market levels.  E.g., United States v. Casanova, 970 F.2d 371, 376 (7th Cir.1992).  But it is enough to say that Rogers offered no substantial evidence, only lawyer's conjecture, that the deal was irresistibly attractive.  Compare United States v. Mosley, 965 F.2d 906, 913 (10th Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Rogers' final attack on his conviction concerns the admission of items recovered from his safe.  The most damaging were a diamond and a number of Krugerrands;  their presence dovetailed with Cunniff's testimony that Rogers had offered such items, along with the motor home, as collateral for the drugs.  Although Rogers moved to exclude the evidence as illegally seized, the district court denied the motion after a pre-trial hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court first ruled that the discovery of the safe was the product of illegal questioning.  Although Rogers had been given Miranda warnings, the court found that the agents had continued to press Rogers after he sought to remain silent.  However, the court also found that the large team of about two dozen agents, who were searching the premises under a search warrant, would have found the safe without Rogers' help;  the court therefore admitted the evidence under the \"inevitable discovery\" doctrine.  Nix v. Williams, 467 U.S. 431, 104 S.Ct. 2501, 81 L.Ed.2d 377 (1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The safe was concealed in the concrete floor of Rogers' library, covered by a built-in desk and drawer.  Whether the safe could have been located short of tearing up the desk is not clear from the record.  Rogers says that the agents were abandoning the search when Rogers revealed the safe's location.  The government, by contrast, stresses the large number of agents in the search;  their success in discovering the concealed underground storage bunker;  their knowledge of the diamond and gold;  and the inferred likelihood that absent Rogers' help the search would have continued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term \"inevitable,\" although part of the Nix doctrine's name, is something of an overstatement.  The facts of Nix itself--a body hidden in an area of many square miles--show that what is required is a high probability that the evidence would have been discovered by lawful means.  See also United States v. Procopio, 88 F.3d 21, 27 (1st Cir.) petition for cert. filed (Nov. 7, 1996) (No. 96-6664).  The probability has not been quantified, but it only confuses matters to pretend that the government must prove to a certainty what would have happened but for the illegally obtained admission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Normally, on a close question like this, a reviewing court will defer to the trial court where the latter has made a fact-intensive judgment (here, as to the likelihood of independent discovery) resting on a plausible view of the evidence.  United States v. McLaughlin, 957 F.2d 12, 16 (1st Cir.1992).  The Supreme Court's recent decision in Ornelas v. United States,         --- U.S. ----, ----, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1663, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996), insisting on de novo review of a probable cause finding, concerned an issue that was more clearly a matter of law application.  But we do have some concern about Rogers' unanswered claim, debatably supported by a record citation, that the search was being abandoned when Rogers revealed the sale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather than pursue this loose end, we affirm instead on the ground that if admission of the evidence was error, it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967).  The government's case was straightforward, based on direct testimony from Cunniff and buttressed by tape recordings and telephone records.  Moreover, Rogers did not deny most of what Cunniff related.  Instead, Rogers sought to convince the jury that he had been play-acting and intended only to string Cunniff along until Oberlander recovered his $20,000 downpayment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this background, the diamond and gold coins added color but very little more to the government's case.  Rogers asserts that this evidence undermined his claim that he was only pretending an interest in buying drugs, but it is difficult to see why this is so.  Even a pretending drug purchaser--for reasons of prudence alone--would have ample reason to name collateral that could be produced if a demand to see it were made.  With or without physical evidence of the collateral, Rogers' defense of pretense was simply implausible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Rogers' remaining claims concern the forfeitures of the ranch, the diamond, the gold Krugerrands, and the motor home.  Criminal forfeiture in drug cases is covered by 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853, which provides that any person convicted of a specified set of offenses shall forfeit proceeds obtained from the violation and property of the defendant used or intended to be used to commit or facilitate the violation.  Rogers contests the judgment of forfeiture on three different grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Rogers contends that the district court should have instructed the jury that the facts to support the forfeiture must be found beyond a reasonable doubt;  instead, the judge told the jury to use a preponderance of the evidence standard to find the facts incident to the forfeiture.  This lesser standard, of course, is directed only to facts other than the predicate finding that the defendant had engaged in a drug crime, an issue which is ordinarily resolved by the criminal conviction itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By practice, criminal forfeitures are determined by the jury.  The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provide that the indictment or information must allege the interest or property subject to criminal forfeiture and that a \"special verdict\" shall be returned as to the extent of the interest or property subject to forfeiture, if any.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 7(c)(2), 31(e).  Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has concluded that the forfeiture is part of the sanction or penalty and not an independent offense.  Libretti v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ----, 116 S.Ct. 356, 363, 133 L.Ed.2d 271 (1995);  cf. 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(a) (final paragraph).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this background, almost every circuit that has pronounced on the issue has held the standard of proof as to forfeiture issues under section 853 (other than the proof of a predicate violation) is a preponderance of the evidence.  See, e.g., United States v. Tanner, 61 F.3d 231, 234-35 (4th Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 925, 133 L.Ed.2d 854 (1996) (citing numerous cases).  The principal reason given by the decisions is that findings relating to penalty or sanction are a part of sentencing;  and sentencing determinations are traditionally based on a preponderance, not on proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  United States v. McCarthy, 77 F.3d 522, 525 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 479, 136 L.Ed.2d 374 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Congress could provide for a more stringent standard, it has certainly not done so in section 853.  On the contrary, it has adopted (in 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(d)) a presumption provision whose terms suggest that Congress assumed that a preponderance standard would be used in deciding forfeiture issues under that section.  See United States v. Elgersma, 971 F.2d 690, 694-95 (11th Cir.1992).  Still, Congress' assumptions are not enactments, and one could argue that Congress left the burden of proof issue to the judiciary, as it does with many procedural details.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If so, we see no reason to depart from the consensus view that criminal forfeiture, being a penalty or sanction issue under section 853, is governed by the same preponderance standard that applies to all other sentencing issues.  The happenstance that the issue is submitted to the jury may complicate the process of instructing jurors and has been offered as a reason for bifurcating the trial.  United States v. Desmarais, 938 F.2d 347, 349 (1st Cir.1991).  But in most other respects, the criminal forfeiture is akin to a jail sentence or a fine and lacks the historical and moral roots that have led to a higher proof requirement for a finding of criminal guilt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rogers' second objection is that the property forfeited does not fall within the statutory definition of property subject to forfeiture under section 853(a).  The statute provides inter alia that property may be forfeited if \"intended to be used ... to commit, or to facilitate the commission of, such violation [the violation for which the defendant was convicted].\"  21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(a)(2).  Rogers contends that, the gravamen of the conspiracy being an agreement, there was no showing that any of the forfeited property was used or intended to be used to create the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The argument is technical but not without some weight.  It can certainly be said, as a matter of language, that the gist of an agreement is an understanding communicated by word or action, so that while Rogers' telephone [instrument] might be property used to commit the offense, the diamond, coins and motor home did not play an actual or prospective role in \"such violation.\"   This is a harder argument for Rogers as to the ranch since it was the place where the agreement was made and so arguably facilitated the agreement.  E.g., United States v. Lewis, 987 F.2d 1349, 1356 (8th Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But as to the collateral, Rogers can colorably argue that the agreement was made--and therefore the crime was initially committed--without any direct \"use\" of the diamond, coins or motor home.  Counter-arguments are available, assuming a broad usage of the word \"use,\" showing once again that language is not a precise instrument.  But we think it is permissible as a matter of language, and sound as a matter of legislative policy, to uphold the forfeiture on the ground that the forfeited property was \"intended to be used\" in carrying out the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">True, the carrying out of the agreement would constitute a separate crime--possession by Rogers with intent to distribute--which is not the \"such violation\" referred to by the statute.  But it is also true that the carrying out of the agreement would comprise a continuation of the conspiracy itself (\"such violation\").  United States v. Brandon, 17 F.3d 409, 451 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 820, 115 S.Ct. 80, 130 L.Ed.2d 34 (1994) (conspiracy may be a continuing agreement).  The agreement would be reaffirmed and maintained, and could be so proved at trial, by the very uses of the diamond and money (as collateral) and of the ranch (to hide the drugs).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sound policy points in the same direction.  Although section 853 is a criminal penalty, it is apparent that Congress was endeavoring not only to increase punishment of drug offenses but also to discourage them by making them highly unprofitable.  In that spirit, section 853(a)(2) defines the property to be forfeited quite broadly (\"used, or intended to be used, in any manner or part, to commit, or to facilitate\"), and the statute further provides that \"[t]he provisions of this section shall be liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purposes.\"  21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(o).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Rogers argues, in connection with the forfeiture as well as conviction, that the property taken from the safe was not properly admitted under the inevitable discovery doctrine.  Whether or not our harmless error analysis would work as well in relation to the forfeiture counts is a debatable issue, but we need not resolve it.  For it is settled that even an illegal seizure of property does not protect it against forfeiture so long as the government can sustain the forfeiture claim with independent evidence. INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1040, 104 S.Ct. 3479, 3484, 82 L.Ed.2d 778 (1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This latter requirement is easily satisfied in this case.  Cunniff gave direct testimony that Rogers had offered the diamond, gold and motor home as a part of the collateral for fronting the marijuana, and there was some additional supporting evidence to this effect.  It is apparent from the verdict that the jury accepted Cunniff's testimony and, as we already noted, the actual presence of the diamond, gold and motor home most certainly contributed very little to this result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Rogers appeals, contesting both the conviction and forfeitures.  We set forth a summary of salient events, deferring certain details pertinent to specific issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1992, Michael Cunniff, an undercover agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration, was introduced to Howard Oberlander in Danvers, Massachusetts.  Oberlander told Cunniff that he was interested in purchasing 500 pounds of Thai marijuana with the assistance of another individual (who later turned out to be Rogers).  During this meeting, Oberlander telephoned Rogers twice, and Rogers agreed to a meeting near Rogers' ranch in California, north of San Francisco, to arrange the purchase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several days later, Oberlander gave Cunniff $20,000 as a good faith down payment.  Then, on June 18, 1992, both men met Rogers in California at a neutral location.  Rogers told Cunniff that he had not traded \"this kind of product\" recently because of the risk of sting operations.  Rogers said that he had an underground storage site at his ranch for concealing the marijuana and invited Cunniff to see the ranch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At Rogers' ranch, Rogers gave Cunniff a tour of the premises.  Rogers asked Cunniff to provide some of the marijuana on credit, offering as collateral gold, a diamond, and the title to a motor home parked on the property.  Oberlander gave Rogers a small sample of the marijuana that Cunniff had earlier provided to Oberlander.  The meeting ended without a final agreement between Rogers and Cunniff on the terms of the sale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the following day, Oberlander and Cunniff returned to Rogers' ranch.  Rogers agreed to the terms of the sale to complete the transaction.  Those terms, discussed in intervening telephone calls, were that Cunniff would \"front\" the entire 500-pound shipment of marijuana in return for the collateral that Rogers had offered.  But during this second visit, Rogers noticed an airplane circling over the ranch and told Oberlander and Cunniff to leave for dinner and return later that evening.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The airplane was a DEA surveillance plane, which followed Cunniff's car as he and Oberlander drove away from the ranch.  From a gas station, Oberlander telephoned Rogers, who said that the plane had followed Cunniff's car and that law enforcement agents had probably planted a tracking device in the car.  Rogers told Oberlander that he did not want to complete the transaction, that Oberlander and Cunniff should leave town and (according to Rogers' testimony) that Rogers never wanted to see them again.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cunniff then met with surveillance agents and had Oberlander arrested.  Cunniff and more than two dozen DEA and local agents returned to Rogers' ranch and arrested Rogers pursuant to a federal arrest warrant.  Earlier that day, agents had also obtained a search warrant authorizing the seizure of property intended to be used to commit federal drug offenses.  Pursuant to this search warrant, the agents searched Rogers' ranch and discovered the hidden underground bunker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the search, agents pressed Rogers to cooperate, although he had said that he wished to remain silent.  After being held at his ranch in handcuffs for over two hours, Rogers revealed the location of a hidden floor safe, built underneath a desk in his library.  The agents opened the safe, which contained currency, a large diamond ring, and gold Krugerrands worth about $5,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a jury trial, Rogers was convicted of conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to distribute.  The jury then considered the forfeiture count in a bifurcated hearing, and in accord with the jury's special verdict the following property was forfeited:  Rogers' ranch and adjoining real property, the motor home, a dozen gold Kruggerands, and the diamond.  The judge imposed a sentence of 90 months imprisonment and a $12,500 fine.  Rogers now appeals both the conviction and sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Rogers' first claim, addressed to his convictions, rests on the premise that he withdrew from the conspiracy by telling Cunniff and Oberlander to leave town and not contact him again.  His own unrebutted testimony, Rogers says, required the district court to grant his motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Crim.P. 29, and, alternatively, supported Rogers' request for an instruction to the jury that withdrawal from the conspiracy constituted an affirmative defense to the charge.  The district court had refused both applications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to procedural objections, the government protests that the evidence does not come close to establishing a bona fide withdrawal from the conspiracy.  Rogers, it says, was merely deferring efforts to transfer the drugs or was feigning withdrawal.  Still, if Rogers' testimony were believed by the jury, the jury might find a withdrawal by Rogers grounded in \"a communication by the accused to his coconspirators that he has abandoned the enterprise and its goals.\"  United States v. Juodakis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498383\"><a href=\"/opinion/498383/united-states-v-aloyisius-juodakis/\"><span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1099</span></a></span>, 1102 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But withdrawal is not a defense to a conspiracy charge if the conspiracy violation has already occurred.  \"The traditional rule here 'is strict and inflexible:  since the crime is complete with the agreement, no subsequent action can exonerate the conspirator of that crime.' \"   2 W.

Rogers claims that the district court erred in refusing to give the jury an instruction on entrapment.

Thus, lack of predisposition is the second substantive element of entrapment.  Gendron, 18 F.3d at 962.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to proof, the defendant must make a threshold showing in order to raise the entrapment issue;  after that, the burden shifts to the government to negate entrapment by proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, that no improper pressure or inducement was used or that the defendant was predisposed to commit the offense.  Acosta, 67 F.3d at 338.   But entrapment may not be argued, nor is any instruction required, unless the defendant points to evidence that, if believed by the jury, would permit such a reasonable doubt on both elements.  Rodriguez, 858 F.2d at 814.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, when Rogers asked for an entrapment instruction, the district court after the close of the evidence ruled that there was enough evidence to permit the jury to have a reasonable doubt as to Rogers' predisposition.  This might seem surprising in view of Rogers' apparent sophistication and his underground bunker.  But Rogers himself testified that he had never been a marijuana dealer, and issues of credibility are largely for the jury.  In all events, the government does not contest the point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also ruled, however, that there was no threshold-level evidence that the government had used improper pressure or inducement to cause Rogers to commit the crime;  and on that ground it refused to give an entrapment instruction.  We review such rulings de novo, Rodriguez, 858 F.2d at 812, so the question for us is the same:  whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Rogers, there was enough evidence of improper pressure or inducement to take the issue to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rogers' most direct route to the necessary showing was his own trial testimony that Oberlander had hassled and harangued him.  Since most of their conversations were unrecorded and Oberlander was not a cooperating government witness, the government could not directly refute this testimony.  But the entrapment \"defense\" applies only if the improper inducement derives from the government.  E.g., United States v. Coady, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"481634\"><a href=\"/opinion/481634/united-states-v-neil-patrick-coady/\"><span class=\"volume\">809</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">119</span></a></span>, 122 (1st Cir.1987).  Otherwise, the defendant has available only more difficult-to-prove defenses such as coercion and necessity which were not invoked by Rogers in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rogers' response is that Oberlander should be treated as an \"unwitting government agent.\"   See United States v. Valencia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"389250\"><a href=\"/opinion/389250/united-states-v-olga-valencia-and-william-suarez-valencia/\"><span class=\"volume\">645</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1158</span></a></span>, 1168-69 (2d Cir.1980);  Note, 95 Harv.L.Rev. 1122 (1982).  This is an image likely to mislead the reader.  Under the case law the government would be responsible if Cunniff told Oberlander to apply the pressure or inducement later deemed improper, and perhaps if Cunniff knowingly tolerated it, but not if Cunniff were ignorant of it.  United States v. Bradley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"489321\"><a href=\"/opinion/489321/united-states-v-john-c-bradley-united-states-of-america-v-howard-f/\"><span class=\"volume\">820</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.1987).  The district court ruled that there was insufficient evidence associating Cunniff with any such conduct by Oberlander.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree.  Assuming that Oberlander did act improperly, nothing in the record shows that Cunniff urged, suggested or was even aware of such conduct.  About the worst that emerges is a single statement by Cunniff, telling Oberlander to \"put some heat on [Rogers].\"  This statement was made as Cunniff and Oberlander drove away from the ranch after their first visit when negotiations had bogged down over whether Cunniff would \"front\" the drugs or obtain payment from Rogers.  The comment is far less sinister than the suggestion of an agent that the intermediary put \"the arm\" on a target, Bradley, 820 F.2d at 7, a phrase implying force or the threat of force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the alternative, Rogers contends that the undisputed facts alone were enough to get to the jury on entrapment, in part because the government \"targeted\" Rogers and pursued him with excessive zeal.  But the DEA did not seek out Rogers as an individual--Oberlander did--and based on a few telephone calls, Rogers proved ready enough to enter into talks.  His only resistance was not to the idea of the crime, but rather to the risks and the terms.  That the negotiations took a good many calls proves nothing.  See United States v. Gifford, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195222\"><a href=\"/opinion/195222/united-states-v-gifford/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">462</span></a></span>, 468 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other strand to Rogers' undisputed-facts argument is that the terms offered were unduly attractive:  that Thai marijuana was an attractive product that was hard to obtain, that it was offered to Rogers on credit for collateral (the gold, diamond and motor home) valued at \"about 20 to 25 percent of the value of the marijuana,\" and that Rogers stood to profit by as much as 10 to 20 percent of the sales price.  This, says Rogers' brief, was \"an irresistibly lucrative deal for a rare and highly prestigious product at a 'cheap' price.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that the product was rare is of little help to Rogers;  a receiver of stolen art can certainly be tempted with a Rembrandt.  Something more might be made--in an extreme case-of extraordinarily favorable terms of credit or a price drastically below market levels.  E.g., United States v. Casanova, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587325\"><a href=\"/opinion/587325/united-states-v-pierre-g-casanova/\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">371</span></a></span>, 376 (7th Cir.1992).  But it is enough to say that Rogers offered no substantial evidence, only lawyer's conjecture, that the deal was irresistibly attractive.  Compare United States v. Mosley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584057\"><a href=\"/opinion/584057/united-states-v-bobby-ray-mosley/\"><span class=\"volume\">965</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">906</span></a></span>, 913 (10th Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Rogers' final attack on his conviction concerns the admission of items recovered from his safe.  The most damaging were a diamond and a number of Krugerrands;  their presence dovetailed with Cunniff's testimony that Rogers had offered such items, along with the motor home, as collateral for the drugs.  Although Rogers moved to exclude the evidence as illegally seized, the district court denied the motion after a pre-trial hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court first ruled that the discovery of the safe was the product of illegal questioning.  Although Rogers had been given Miranda warnings, the court found that the agents had continued to press Rogers after he sought to remain silent.  However, the court also found that the large team of about two dozen agents, who were searching the premises under a search warrant, would have found the safe without Rogers' help;  the court therefore admitted the evidence under the \"inevitable discovery\" doctrine.

Williams, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111204\"><a href=\"/opinion/111204/nix-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">431</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111204\"><a href=\"/opinion/111204/nix-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Whether the safe could have been located short of tearing up the desk is not clear from the record.  Rogers says that the agents were abandoning the search when Rogers revealed the safe's location.  The government, by contrast, stresses the large number of agents in the search;  their success in discovering the concealed underground storage bunker;  their knowledge of the diamond and gold;  and the inferred likelihood that absent Rogers' help the search would have continued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term \"inevitable,\" although part of the Nix doctrine's name, is something of an overstatement.  The facts of Nix itself--a body hidden in an area of many square miles--show that what is required is a high probability that the evidence would have been discovered by lawful means.

The probability has not been quantified, but it only confuses matters to pretend that the government must prove to a certainty what would have happened but for the illegally obtained admission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Normally, on a close question like this, a reviewing court will defer to the trial court where the latter has made a fact-intensive judgment (here, as to the likelihood of independent discovery) resting on a plausible view of the evidence.

But we do have some concern about Rogers' unanswered claim, debatably supported by a record citation, that the search was being abandoned when Rogers revealed the sale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather than pursue this loose end, we affirm instead on the ground that if admission of the evidence was error, it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">705</span></a></span> (1967).  The government's case was straightforward, based on direct testimony from Cunniff and buttressed by tape recordings and telephone records.  Moreover, Rogers did not deny most of what Cunniff related.  Instead, Rogers sought to convince the jury that he had been play-acting and intended only to string Cunniff along until Oberlander recovered his $20,000 downpayment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this background, the diamond and gold coins added color but very little more to the government's case.  Rogers asserts that this evidence undermined his claim that he was only pretending an interest in buying drugs, but it is difficult to see why this is so.  Even a pretending drug purchaser--for reasons of prudence alone--would have ample reason to name collateral that could be produced if a demand to see it were made.  With or without physical evidence of the collateral, Rogers' defense of pretense was simply implausible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Rogers' remaining claims concern the forfeitures of the ranch, the diamond, the gold Krugerrands, and the motor home.  Criminal forfeiture in drug cases is covered by 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853, which provides that any person convicted of a specified set of offenses shall forfeit proceeds obtained from the violation and property of the defendant used or intended to be used to commit or facilitate the violation.  Rogers contests the judgment of forfeiture on three different grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Rogers contends that the district court should have instructed the jury that the facts to support the forfeiture must be found beyond a reasonable doubt;  instead, the judge told the jury to use a preponderance of the evidence standard to find the facts incident to the forfeiture.  This lesser standard, of course, is directed only to facts other than the predicate finding that the defendant had engaged in a drug crime, an issue which is ordinarily resolved by the criminal conviction itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By practice, criminal forfeitures are determined by the jury.  The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provide that the indictment or information must allege the interest or property subject to criminal forfeiture and that a \"special verdict\" shall be returned as to the extent of the interest or property subject to forfeiture, if any.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 7(c)(2), 31(e).  Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has concluded that the forfeiture is part of the sanction or penalty and not an independent offense.  Libretti v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117979\"><a href=\"/opinion/117979/libretti-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">271</span></a></span> (1995);  cf. 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(a) (final paragraph).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this background, almost every circuit that has pronounced on the issue has held the standard of proof as to forfeiture issues under section 853 (other than the proof of a predicate violation) is a preponderance of the evidence.  See, e.g., United States v. Tanner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"700622\"><a href=\"/opinion/700622/united-states-v-william-bennett-tanner/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></a></span>, 234-35 (4th Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">854</span></span> (1996) (citing numerous cases).  The principal reason given by the decisions is that findings relating to penalty or sanction are a part of sentencing;  and sentencing determinations are traditionally based on a preponderance, not on proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  United States v. McCarthy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196595\"><a href=\"/opinion/196595/united-states-v-mccarthy/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">522</span></a></span>, 525 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

On the contrary, it has adopted (in 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(d)) a presumption provision whose terms suggest that Congress assumed that a preponderance standard would be used in deciding forfeiture issues under that section.  See United States v. Elgersma, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587754\"><a href=\"/opinion/587754/united-states-v-edwin-elgersma-united-states-of-america-v-edwin-elgersma/\"><span class=\"volume\">971</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">690</span></a></span>, 694-95 (11th Cir.1992).  Still, Congress' assumptions are not enactments, and one could argue that Congress left the burden of proof issue to the judiciary, as it does with many procedural details.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If so, we see no reason to depart from the consensus view that criminal forfeiture, being a penalty or sanction issue under section 853, is governed by the same preponderance standard that applies to all other sentencing issues.  The happenstance that the issue is submitted to the jury may complicate the process of instructing jurors and has been offered as a reason for bifurcating the trial.  United States v. Desmarais, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564779\"><a href=\"/opinion/564779/united-states-v-paul-desmarais/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span>, 349 (1st Cir.1991).  But in most other respects, the criminal forfeiture is akin to a jail sentence or a fine and lacks the historical and moral roots that have led to a higher proof requirement for a finding of criminal guilt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rogers' second objection is that the property forfeited does not fall within the statutory definition of property subject to forfeiture under section 853(a).  The statute provides inter alia that property may be forfeited if \"intended to be used ... to commit, or to facilitate the commission of, such violation [the violation for which the defendant was convicted].\"  21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(a)(2).  Rogers contends that, the gravamen of the conspiracy being an agreement, there was no showing that any of the forfeited property was used or intended to be used to create the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The argument is technical but not without some weight.  It can certainly be said, as a matter of language, that the gist of an agreement is an understanding communicated by word or action, so that while Rogers' telephone [instrument] might be property used to commit the offense, the diamond, coins and motor home did not play an actual or prospective role in \"such violation.\"   This is a harder argument for Rogers as to the ranch since it was the place where the agreement was made and so arguably facilitated the agreement.  E.g., United States v. Lewis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601846\"><a href=\"/opinion/601846/united-states-v-gerald-e-lewis-united-states-of-america-v-gerald-e/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1349</span></a></span>, 1356 (8th Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But as to the collateral, Rogers can colorably argue that the agreement was made--and therefore the crime was initially committed--without any direct \"use\" of the diamond, coins or motor home.  Counter-arguments are available, assuming a broad usage of the word \"use,\" showing once again that language is not a precise instrument.  But we think it is permissible as a matter of language, and sound as a matter of legislative policy, to uphold the forfeiture on the ground that the forfeited property was \"intended to be used\" in carrying out the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">True, the carrying out of the agreement would constitute a separate crime--possession by Rogers with intent to distribute--which is not the \"such violation\" referred to by the statute.  But it is also true that the carrying out of the agreement would comprise a continuation of the conspiracy itself (\"such violation\").  United States v. Brandon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"664045\"><a href=\"/opinion/664045/united-states-v-peter-brandon-united-states-of-america-v-charles-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></a></span>, 451 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">820</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></span> (1994) (conspiracy may be a continuing agreement).  The agreement would be reaffirmed and maintained, and could be so proved at trial, by the very uses of the diamond and money (as collateral) and of the ranch (to hide the drugs).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sound policy points in the same direction.  Although section 853 is a criminal penalty, it is apparent that Congress was endeavoring not only to increase punishment of drug offenses but also to discourage them by making them highly unprofitable.  In that spirit, section 853(a)(2) defines the property to be forfeited quite broadly (\"used, or intended to be used, in any manner or part, to commit, or to facilitate\"), and the statute further provides that \"[t]he provisions of this section shall be liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purposes.\"  21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(o).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Rogers argues, in connection with the forfeiture as well as conviction, that the property taken from the safe was not properly admitted under the inevitable discovery doctrine.  Whether or not our harmless error analysis would work as well in relation to the forfeiture counts is a debatable issue, but we need not resolve it.  For it is settled that even an illegal seizure of property does not protect it against forfeiture so long as the government can sustain the forfeiture claim with independent evidence. INS v.
